The viewing angle is amazing. Unlike, my previous other tablets. I kid you not, if you are looking at one part of the screen closely, you're likely going to have to move the tablet in order to see other parts clearly. I can't see what's on the screen when it's sitting flat on my desk, under my chin, directly in front of me. It's really REALLY bad. I am very glad this tablet solve that issue, now it so pleasant to read and watch movie with out worry to fixed in ther right position.  I highly recommend this tablet to other with viewing angle issue."}

I contact lepan only to be told even though this would still be under the original warranty date they only replace a tablet once. aside from the fall which is our fault there was a defective part on the usb port on one volume on another and btw even the new one the usb port was very sensitive. cheaply made product with horrible customer service"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "What a great tablet. Easy to use and durable. I bought this tablet to use as a video source for a teleprompter and it works great. The android store offers a variety of teleprompter apps (many are free!) and it has been awesome. I chose this tablet because it is the same dimensions as the Apple Ipad (which is needed for my teleprompter) but at half the cost. I am very satisfied. In addition,  I use it all the time for searching the web, watching Youtube videos, sending emails, and streaming NETFLIX. It does an excellent job of streaming, never choppy or rebuffering. It plays clean. With the removable micro SD card (sold separately) I copied about 15 full length movies to watch while on vacation and it held up. It has a long battery life and my kids used the tablet for hours on end watching movies while I was driving. I've never had a problem with this tablet freezing up, turning off, overheating, acting weird in any way. It's been solid. Tech savvy kids and not-so-savvy adults can use this tablet easily and often. Everyone loves it.\n\nMy only criticisms and they are very minor: 1) The audio Up/Down controls are a little hard to use even when I know how. The buttons are built so close the body of the tablet it's kind of hard turning the volume up and down, but this is really no big deal.  2) The movies I copied onto the SD card  would play choppy if they were Blue Ray rips. This tablet could not handle a Blue Ray rip. It did fine with AVI, MPEG4, HD, SD, 1080, 720 etc. It just couldn't handle a Blue Ray rip. But again, no big deal. Buy it. Buy it now."}

I've used this primarily at school to view textbook PDFs and to access class websites and such, and I've also used it quite a bit at home to play streaming music through a speaker system. For the most part it has worked flawlessly, with no major issues. WiFi connectivity is generally pretty good, and I'm happy with its speed and battery life. I've owned this thing for around 3 years with no major issues, so durability is solid as well. The only design feature that annoys me is that the volume buttons are texture-less and completely flush with the body of the tablet, making them weirdly hard to find- I've spend many hours using this tablet and I still have to look to find the volume buttons most times. That is really my only gripe, and it's certainly not a deal breaker! For the money, you can't beat this thing. As long as you don't get a lemon, you'll be happy with it."}

Even the reviews are not good, I bought it because the specifications are great and it was cheap.\nNow it will be not wrong to say, I have learnt the lesson hard way. \"Don't buy if reviews are not good\".\n\nFirst the pros:\n1. Big screen. almost 10 inches. Actually it was pretty good indoors. But completely useless outdoors.\n2. Nice looking tab.\n3. Thats all.\n\nCons:\n1. Its buggy.  Apps like hulu and netflix are always crashing.  May be its something to do with ICS or  may be due to some customization done by Lepan over ICS.\n2. Tablet screen keeps on freezing  regularly, like once in a 15 days or so. I keep in resetting it (they provided a nice reset button) and moved on, until on fine day, it froze completely. Now its stuck in the boot screen forever.\n3. Customer care sucks.  I raised a ticket on their support website. Since their website has not updated the status after two days, I tried their customer care number.  After twice disconnected from their side and a long holding time, finally when talked to an executive, he advised me to go to their support web site and check the ticket status online and disconnected the call. So here I am, with a frozen tablet and waiting for their status update online.\n\nI will update more about the customer service (if I ever get it)....."}

It froze, the first day I've got it, after using it for only half hour then constantly after that. I just kept on resetting it numeral times, over and over again! It didn't just freeze like a regular freeze either, it also got stuck with the sound like if it was a scratched vinyl playing!!!\nI've took it to an electronic expert and he simply said that this tablet had some major internal damage and that it shouldn't have been put back on the market. It got reset, rebooted to the manufacturer' s settings and still, no improvement. All because it has some serious damages which I didn't cause.\nIt was the most disappointing purchase I've made with amazon.\nI ended up saving up for a few months, and then purchasing another tablet, a totally different one and I've been more than happy since.\nSorry about the negative review but I do not wish anyone to go through what I did.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I've had this tablet for a year and a half now, and I regret 'cheaping out' every time I pick the thing up.  The touch screen is sluggish, the response time is slow (and there's nothing wrong with my WiFi) and compared to the resolution of the screens on other tablets out there, it's average at best. One piece of advice - do not, whatever you do - let the battery go below 10% because if it does out entirely, you may never get it started again.  The charger adapter is finicky, and once in a while the tablet will just not start up.  At all. You'll have to find a thumbtack, flip the thing over, and stick it in the \"reset\" hole on the back of the machine. And even then, you may have to do it more than once. I bought this because I didn't want to spend twice the amount on a higher-end tablet... TRUST me when I say it's worth the extra money. My husband bought me a Samsung Galaxy Tab this past Christmas and there's just no comparison. My kids now use the LePan to play games, and that's it."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "Pros: Fast little tablet, efficient, great screen, very decent sound, and overall, more than I expected when I bought it...if it wasn't for the BIG con, I would recommend it for anyone...I don't suggest it.\n\nCON: from the get go I had an issue that it would randomly not turn on.  About once a week (ever since I got it- 2 years ago), I've had to press the reset button (aka-find a paperclip, back of an earring, a pin, or anything that fits in the tiny reset hole) in order for it to turn on...or, I've had to connect it to the charger for it to turn on.  TODAY, on the two year anniversary of my purchase, the reset button has decided to no longer work and it won't turn on with anything. I've used different chargers, troubleshooted through forums, done everything I can...and when I called them for help, they admitted that there was a hardware problem with this model and that they've been replacing them.  I told them that I've been having issues since I bought it but never sent it in because it was a pretty easy fix.  They pretty much can't do anything because it's been two years and their warranty is for 1 year.  In either case, it doesn't really matter because in all of the forums I've read, people are complaining that the replacements that they were sent are acting up the same way.  In a way, I consider myself lucky because others have had their reset button break much sooner.\n\nAll in all, if you want to have to be resetting it constantly and eventually end up with a dead tablet, go for it.  Otherwise, just keep looking for another one.  It's really a shame, when it works, it's awesome."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "Actually I might have been reviewing it on my Le Pan I when it decided to stop working for the 327th time, in which case my review was lost forever.\n\nDon't buy this.  I mean, the fact that you CAN'T buy it on Amazon anymore should put a damper on that, but if you happen to be searching for reviews before buying it from someplace else (like a guy in a van who is also selling meat and stereos) keep in mind that this thing fails on so many levels it's mind-bottling.  (Not mind-boggling, I mean it practically converts your mind into diet cola and bottles it.)\n\nOne entire side of the screen stopped responding to touch input.  The reset switch (the one accessed through a hole on the back of the thing) stopped working.  It took maybe five tries to get my flash card to get recognized, and occasionally it would stop showing up, making the tablet useless until it decided to start working again.  The battery's connection to the board is awful so it occasionally stops charging and you have to open the thing to reconnect it.  The power button isn't soldered to the main board very well so some owners (such as my lucky self) have had to bust out our soldering irons or reflow tools to fix it.  Le Pan's technical support for the thing was utterly nonexistent even when the thing was the only product they made, and now they appear to have forgotten the thing ever existed at all.  The only high note was that it set my standards for tablets so incredibly low that my new Jelly Bean-running tablet seems like a cross between Superman and the Messiah.\n\nOh, and speaking of Android versions, Le Pan once stated that the 2.2-running TC 970 would be upgradeable to newer versions.  And technically they were telling the truth, but only because they apparently considered \"buying a newer model of tablet\" to be upgrading."}

The higher end games run very smooth on the tab without any stutter or choppiness. The battery life as is expected with most android things is somewhat on the lower side and, the charging time is also relatively long. Although I haven't done an actual test on the charging time i'd say it takes about 8 hrs to fully charge from 30%. I do use a battery saving app and I usually get about 10 hrs of on and off use. Although if you use it for listening to music and web surfing you might get more out of the battery charge. The resolution  is great hq videos on youtube look great and it can play hd movies as well. The price is perfect although if someone were\nconsidering buying a cheap tablet with great specs I might tell them to save up to buy the new amazon hdx 7\" tab being $299 I think.

They promised when they released this product that the Android OS would be upgradeable for free. Then they changed their minds. They should have at least done a DEEP discount, I'm talking the retail price for Le Pan 1, allowing registered owners to upgrade to Le Pan 2. The main reason I am reselling my tablet is I need to record for work. The microphone in the tablet is pitiful. It is of such low quality it isn't usable. I can't even Skype with it which is a far lower standard than what I need. The cheap mic would be forgivable if an external mic could be used. No such luck. No such upgrade.\n\nOtherwise the optics on this thing are fantastic! Gaming should be super fun. (I don't game.) I've been able to download Google apps and use them regularly.

All my responses were via email - and after being told to just \"wipe out the tablet\" and start again, i was, well shall we say, a little upset. They told me to send it back, but if they found no issues they would charge me (without telling me what they will charge) a service fee - even though i had it for less than 3 weeks.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I was reading through the reviews for this product and found them fairly mixed, so I decided to add my experience. I've had my Le Pan 970 I for almost two years. I bought it just as they were switching over to the II, and subsequently got a really good sale price. The single major disadvantage that I've seen is the inability to easily upgrade to newer versions of the Android OS.\n\nOther than that, I've been very pleased with my tablet. I primarily use it for internet surfing, reading news and beaming video to a Roku via the Twonky app. It's been incredibly reliable and easy to use. Yes, you will occasionally come across an app that acts a little buggy. No, you will not be able to replace a desktop with this device. You probably won't want to edit video, write long documents or create media presentations using this device. But I have a desktop and a laptop for those needs. If you want an easily portable media device for internet surfing, reading books/comics or displaying photos on the go, this tablet is great. Using the SD slot, storage is a cheap upgrade.\n\nThere are absolutely better tablets on the market. There are faster, more powerful and easier to use options out there. And those options cost at least 2-3 times what the Le Pan costs. That's a trade-off you'll have to decide for yourself."}

Most of my friends come to me with their PC problems. I have used other tablets before, first-time using android.\n\nAbout the let pan ll: at first, the tablet gave errors when trying to download apps from Google play store, was unable to install adobe flash player, and was generally very buggy. After \"googling\" for answers and not finding any, i finally gave up and performed a factory reset. After the reset, everything worked fine and I have not had any problems at all since then. I noticed that some apparent 3rd-party apps were missing after the reset. I assume these were installed at the factory and were the causes of the problems.\nAfter sorting-out the issues, I am very happy with the tablet. The build quality feels solid, and battery life is very good. The battery will last for about 7-8 hours of constant use with mixed web surfing, game play, etc. If not used for gaming, a single charge will last for 2+ days. I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for an affordable android tablet."}

I wanted to surprise my sister with a tablet, and decided to put it through the paces before sending it to her. I have owned a 7\" Samsung tablet for over a year, and wanted to compare the two products.  After 2 days of playing on LePan, as well as sharing it with coworkers, I am packing it up and returning it.  The tablet regularly freezes up and requires \"resetting\".  Really?  This is necessary in 2013? I can't diagnose the cause, other than this product is garbage.\nIn addition to not working, it has a terrible design.  The on/off buttons and the volume buttons have such a minimal profile on the edge, that it is difficult to turn the tablet on/off, and nearly impossible to change the volume.  You have to turn up the lights, turn the tablet on its side, and search for the buttons. The volume control in particular is just plain stupid (invisible buttons are never a good idea in my opinion).  And an amusing note...the LePan Quick Start Guide Instructions for starting the product:  \"Press the power button for seconds\"????  That was my first clue that I was not going to like LePan.  I recently updated the software on my Samsung tablet and the interface is now identical to my Samsung S4 phone..sweet!  Samsung knows how to design, support and sell electronics. Save your money and invest in a proven product like Samsung (or product of your choice other than LePan)."}

If you just want simple, however, it may not appeal to you.\n\nThe Le Pan is a bit of an odd duck, with some of its Ipad-ish qualities. One port for power/usb/HDMI ... can take some getting used to. I have been finding out, however, that just because it doesn't work the way I'm used to, that does not mean it can not be done. I just have to step up my tech.\n\nCan't grab a usb flash drive and transfer data? Ok, fine - I found an app and now can transfer my data wirelessly on my home network.\n\nMovies won't play? Nope, don't re-rip or convert - find another app.\n\nCan't find any movies through the Google Apps? That's because the Google store sees Le Pan II as.. something far less. What, I'm not sure. But use Chrome, go to the Google Store page, sign in there, browse, buy, add to your list, and then - it's there in your Play Movie app and you can watch it. (Just find a free preview to test run.)\n\nNeed to update all those compatible apps that came on it, that Google store says isn't compatible? Well, the standard ones that were included tend to be free and therefore are in 1Mobile Market and you can use 1Mobile Market's app to update them.\n\nTo be honest, the 2 most frustrating things are Google Play's oh so helpful (not) feature that treats all information they've deemed incompatible invisible. Much better would be Amazon's method where you can see, read about and study all items they sell.. but that shows a \"Not compatible with device\" warning. The invisible Google way leaves many people clueless that something does exist. And unable to research options. Including the option - I need a different device. The second huge headache has nothing to do with Le Pan and affects all tablets. It was finding out a change in Xfinity's tablet protocol that I've yet to find an app to deal with.\n\nI keep hoping Google Play will get it together and reassign LePan II's status, because right now I think its sitting at Gingerbread or something. But until that happens, many tablet users aren't going to want to deal with the annoying work-arounds. And yes, there is 1Mobile Market and Amazon, but 1 doesn't carry anything that isn't free and some people may have noticed, Amazon doesn't carry a huge selection of apps that may directly compete with them.\n\nI love my Amazon, its my go-to place. I have Amazon shortcuts on my laptop and tablet, but, I want full access to Google Play too.\n\nGet that fixed, and LePan II with ICS would be outstanding, especially for this price. Get that fixed and I would give Le Pan II with ICS 5 stars and highly recommend it to family and friends."}

It got to the point that I would have to restart it 6-8 times within an hour. It then started to show horizontal colored lines, but nothing else. It would not turn on without resetting it. After this, it would not turn on without it being plugged in and resetting it. Final straw was 2 nites ago when it did not respond to anything. LePan has told me that my warranty with them did not extend just because they sent me a new tablet and they would charge $100.00+ to ship & fix it.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I bought the Le Pan 970 about 2 years ago because (a) it was on sale and (b) it packs a TON of features that I need. This wasn't going to be for average use, I installed it in my car as a music player, GPS, and on occasion digital gauge display for MPH/fuel economy/engine temp/etc. I have it connected to a generic 2A USB charge that is triggered with the key. I use Tasker to control the system by telling it when to sleep/wake up and when the screen should remain on/off. It is subject to severe hot and cold weather, vibration, and is often left for days (sometimes well over a week) in a sleep state with literally no problems at all. It refuses to die or malfunction in any way whatsoever, even without being reset or turned off for months at a time.\n\nThe pluses: GPS works great even in bad weather and inside the car. Bluetooth is very stable and connects to my OBDII dongle every time if need be (I have another tablet that handles the gauges 99% of the time, but this serves as a backup). Screen is excellent even in direct sunlight. Even after days on standby the battery never drops below 50%, and quickly charges up even with the screen on full-time and max brightness. Refuses to malfunction or shut-off without my prompting.\n\nThe negatives: No Android updates from the manufacturer. Limited aftermarket ROMs. No USB hosting (that I'm aware of). The processor is considered dated, and I have run into stuttering audio while trying to run intensive programs in tandem, although I've only had this happen while trying to run Co-Pilot as my navigation. I switched to Sygic and the problem stopped completely. The camera is rough at best, and the built-in speakers are headache inducing at anything but low volume, although these are common problems with any tablet in this price range and of this age.\n\nI've used several different tablets in my car (Nook Color running various flavors of CM, MID a81e, Lenovo a2107), and because they've all been on the \"budget\" side of things none of them except for the Le Pan have performed very well. The 970 has not only performed well in terms of performance and stability but gone above-and-beyond my wildest dreams in terms of sheer longevity and tenaciousness."}

I cannot recommend this tablet in any way.  My purchase of it was totally disappointing, and after only a year I have a dead piece of junk that would cost more to repair than to purchase!  I purchased this tablet in April 2012.  I was very excited by all the positive reviews and waited a couple of months until it was available to purchase it.  At the time it was $279 (now it is $100 less -- wonder why?)  The first one I received had a broken screen.  Amazon took it back and sent me a new one right away.\nIt worked pretty well for awhile, but I found the documentation (I actually read that stuff!) to be pretty much useless. Lots of little things began to annoy me about it. The fact that it uses a cable unique to the Le Pan (as opposed to a mini-usb or ipod type connector was disappointing. I had mostly wanted to use the tablet as a travel computer and a photo album.  As as designer I wanted to have quick access to photos of projects to show my clients.  The tablet didn't really work well for either purpose.  I was disappointed not to be able to find a case or a keyboard to use with the tablet that didn't require massive modifications of some kind. About three months ago, the tablet just one day erased all the photos I had on it.  Most of them were backed up other places but not all (my fault, I know).  Then it started to not charge up fully.  Then, just when it was out of warranty, one day it just wouldn't turn on at all. My usual computer repair place wouldn't touch it, and neither would another phone/android repair place that I took it to. The technician there said that he thought the battery was \"loose.\"  While I was waiting three days for them to figure out what to do with piece of junk, I discovered lots of other people on line have had the same problems with the battery -- so this is not just me. I logged on to the LePan website and filled out a \"service ticket\" explaining all of this.  I got back what was probably a form response, saying send us $100 (minimum charge) via pay pal and pack it up and pay to send it to us, and we'll see what we can do.  Oh yeah, and take all your personal information off before you send it to us.  SERIOUSLY?  If I could turn it on to remove the data, I wouldn't be in this situation.

If I had it to do over I would try a different tablet. After the warranty runs out, these are probably throw away. Also part of the repair wipes your stuff and the tablet is returned in new out of box condition (no apps or games)."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I have had my tablet for about 6 weeks. It worked perfectly in the beginning as I only needed to charge it about every other day or so. Since I have a 2 year old, it gets a fair amount of use and he loves it. The wireless receiver is pretty good. I haven't had any issues with dropped signals unless I am at the very edge of the access point's range. I have downloaded apps from both the Google Play Store and Amazon Appstore without incident. Any apps that have malfunctioned were faulty to begin with. I mostly use it for Facebook, Twitter, email, job searching, and a few games before bed. It's pretty decent if that's all you plan to use it for.\n\nOne thing I don't like about this version is that the battery doesn't seem to last all that long. After six weeks I'm having issues with it not having a consistent charge or sudden fluctuations. Also, if you like Hulu, it is not supported on this version. Youtube works fine if you don't use Chrome (no Flash support so I use Firefox).\n\nFor the most part, I do like the Le Pan II. It was a replacement after my first tablet (Le Pan S) was damaged. It serves its purpose and is very responsive like the specs say. I could live with it if the Hulu Plus app was supported. If Hulu is a must, go with the Le Pan S. Otherwise, this version should serve you well."}

Reset, restart, recharge, etc. has not worked. the unit did work nicely up to this point. wifi was not bad, however, the screen response was slow and Andriod 2.3 was not very robust.\n\nThis is a classic case of you get what you pay for and for some, it still runs, for others it has failed much sooner than mine did so i guess, all in all, i should be happy with 1.5 years but I'm not. Buyer beware. can't comment on the newer unit LEPAN II but if you have $200+ to spend, spend the extra $100-200 and get a Samsung or an IPad mini, etc. Even the Kindle HD Fire is a better option i would think....\n\nupdate: 6/1/13\ngo here. you can reboot this thing if you get this issue. its working again, however all the data is gone but its good to have it back again.\nhttp://www.forum.lepanlife.com/thread-1678-post-19276.html#pid19276"}

I wasn't sure if I was going to like the 4:3 screen ratio but for surfing the web I love it.  My Dad whipped out his IPAD, not sure if it was 1 or 2 I think 2, the picture quality was exactly the same.  For the price I couldn't find a better 10inch tablet that could beat its specs.  CONS:  That good quality build equals heavier tablet.  I felt some other 10inch tablets and its definitely on the heavier side.  The screen gets smears with every swipe so you need some sort of cover for it.  I also had a small issue with powering it down, it would turn back on.

I used hers a few times and decided that I wanted a tablet too, but did not want to spend another $350 dollars. I started to search for reviews of cheaper tablets and ran across this LePan 2 tablet. Decided to give it a try. I am very pleased. It does everything that her Galaxy Tab does. Just as quickly and flawlessly, I might add. Her and I sat side by side and loaded the same videos and programs at exactly the same time.. There was little to no difference in the speed. Other than small very small differences in picture quality, I find this tablet very comparable to the Galaxy Tab 2. The picture quality is excellent and HD. Just when comparing it to the Galaxy Tab, side by side, The Galaxy picture is a little sharper, but I think I only noticed because I had them side by side with the exact same video playing. It loads youtube, netflix, HBO Go and any other video from any other site that I have tried flawlessly without lag. The battery life is great and the tablet speed is great. This tablet is easily comparable to tablets well out of its price range. I know that many of the reviews on here talk of issues upgrading the software. I did not have this issue, but mine was already upgraded when I purchased it, so I cannot speak of the ease or difficulty of this action, but I would recommend this tablet to anyone. If I had to complain at all, which I am just knit picking by saying this. The power button is a little small and while the sound quality is good, I wish the speakers were on the front like they are on the Galaxy Tab. These are very tolerable issues, but worthy of mention."}

I find myself using this tablet for everything from surfing the web to creation of documents.  Another plus point is that is has Android ICS on it, which in my opinion is way better than the previous versions.  I like the metallic styling, seems more durable than the plastic casings most tablets have.  The touchscreen is very responsive &  quick.  The battery life is excellent, I can use it almost all day with a full charge, this include watching lots of videos.  I don't care too much for the camera on it,  it's lacking, but I dind't buy the tablet because of the camera so it's not a big disadvantage for me.  I was frustrated when I found out the difficulties involved with getting picasa albums to sync with the gallery, but once I got it to sync it's been no problems since.  I really don't know how I got it to sync, but I went into the gallery and saw that my picasa albums were synced.  The keyboard is also nice, its keys well space for my big fingers & paired with the very responsive touch screen make it second nature to type on, to me it feels almost like typing on my desktop keyboard.  I can't wait to find out the endurance of this tablet, I'm hoping it will last a long time.\n\n03/14/2014: After a year I'm still pleased with this purchase.  The tablet works just as good as it did when I got it.  The battery life is great, I use this tablet more than my PC.

First I promptly put on the screen savers from POSRUS on both tablets and soon after was setting up Gmail,email, documents to go for my microsoft word files, and my powerpoint documents Netflix,crackle, you name it I downloaded it. Everything was so easy to accomplish with this tablet that I was up and running in an hour. I installed a Sandisk 32g microsd card and seemlessly transferred documents from the le pan 2 to the micro SD card using the app file manager (just copy and paste to where you want it to go). My wife also loves her Le pan 2 and can't put it down. The display is absolutely beautiful and I can't wait to watch HD movies on it. If you are wondering whether to buy this tablet do not hesitate to jump in with both feet. You will not be disappointed."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "Your tablet needs to be light enough to manage with one hand, and this one is not. Your tablet needs to be able to easily connect to a keyboard if you need to do lots of typing. This one was promoted along with the Sanoxy keyboard case that does NOT connect, so I am disappointed in that purchase. I have watched several Netflix videos on the TC-970 with headphones, and the experience is very liberating, as well as sonically exciting. Built-in speakers cannot do justice to movie soundtracks or even TV episode audio. Then there is the lockup/freeze-up issue that happens too frequently and requires a hardware reset. I can see how tablets generally will likely become pervasive, and for good reasons. I much prefer a non-touch interface (how dirty is that screen?) and standard QWERTY keyboard for internet browsing and light content creation."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I've had my ups and downs with this tablet some were my fault absolutely and some that were not. Over all I'd have to agree with what most people say. After having it for a year now I have learned a few things about it and how to get a handle on it, my only big issue with it is the freezing (thank god for that power button and reset hole) but other than that I really do love it. I'm planning on upgrading to the La pan II which seems to have less of a freezing issues and since it's the same product just upgraded, I predict that I will love it as well. And now that the price of Le Pan II seems to have gone down, and Le Pan I costs more now (they stopped production on it), re-selling it to amazon and then buying the new version seems worth while now. And I'd also like access to the Android 4.0 ICS version and some of the apps that are currently unavailable to me. I'm a tech savvy kind of person who can figure out how to make things work well for me, so I've been able to make the Le Pan a very capable product for me, just as well as any other high tier tablets (my Dad has an Ipad and I like my Le pan more as it gives me more freedom and I like the android market more) and it has lots of capabilities for a fraction of the price. So I stand by this one for future use. Of course that does not mean you would feel the same way, I love it for my use, you may feel differently (I recommend trying tablets out first before you buy/keep). I also wanted to share some tips to some people who have had certain issues with the tablet not starting (after the freezing) and having had similar experience I wanted to share a few ways it worked for me. If the reset hole does not work, which happened for me. Here are two things you can do: let the battery drain completely leave it not charging for a day or two (I left it for 4 days because it was fully charged when it happened) and then press reset hole and charge for a day or over night and then when you press the power button (lightly for a sec) you should be able to see that image of a battery that's charging (usually full by this point) if not try pressing reset again now. And it should turn on (after holding the power button for a few sec and waiting for the vibrate, like usual). Now If there is some kind of internal error and you tablet keeps shutting of, or there is a virus (that is why you should always have anti-virus, and yes it can happen) then you should factory reset it. Of course you can go to the settings and do this if you tablet is turning on but if not then: press and hold the volume up (sometimes try down) and the power button together for 15 seconds or so, a screen will come on asking if you want to factory reset (and some other options, there is another reset option you can choose (I forget the name but it's something to do with connection) if says if your android market isn't working properly and you are not able to download and install/update apps) use the volume keys to move up and down and the power button to select which ever option you need. It's a good idea to have a app-back-up app and have it saved to your SD card and Android also has a list of all the apps you have installed in your market. So yeah I have learned all these from experience for quite a while now, in most cases it is just some minor shock the system got and everything works after one of these methods. Now if none of these method work for you then either your power button is broken (if this is the case the reset hole should still work for you), your screen isn't working, or you've some kind of internal damage, these are usually caused by shock or dropping. Dropping/jolting is the worst thing you can do with these things so investing on a good case (with shock resistance too maybe) will help you in the long run. Avoid keeping it in bad temperature as well, like leaving it in you car in a hot/cold day and of course avoid getting it wet. I hope this helps everyone facing these issues. Le Pan is good about re-pairing/replacing if none of these methods work for you which is covered with in their warranty if outside of the warranty try just taking to their support they tend to be pretty helpful (at least they were for me). Good luck!"}

My patience pays off though because I have two smooth running machines with great battery life.\n\nThe let pan user community on the web has been great with assistance on certain le pan related questions like getting flash up and running, getting a fantastic volume boosting app from Google play (Equalizer). Our tablets can hook up to the computer and grab images and files in no time. The wifi is great...never any issues. And with my HDMI cable I can plug into my computer monitor or TV for a full screen video and audio experience for my TV/video downloads.\n\nI think this is a fantastic tablet especially for the price (159 CA). I have dropped my tablet many times through my own carelessness and thanks to the aluminum backing I've been able to snap it back together with no problems with hardware or performance. And it landed on its corner! For that reason I'd recommend a good case with corner protection if possible as the le pan does tend to favor one particular corner...maybe that's where the battery is...\n\nI have used a family members 7 inch tab and while that may be more comfortable to hold for an extended browsing session laying back on the couch, the screen size just doesn't compare. I much prefer browsing on my le pan, which by the way was half the price of said 7 inch tablet...\n\nI don't usually leave reviews, but for this product I just had to leave feedback showing my support for this tablet. If you are considering a tablet, don't let the name deter you. Especially if you are resourceful. Seriously, if you are the curious type who wants to figure out how to do all kinds of neat things with your android device, it only takes a little bit of motivated research. Conversely if you want something out of the box that will suit almost all of your needs, le pan II also fits the bill for that."}

Nothing extreme, just annoyances.  It locked up on occasion, and the touch screen sometimes was a little off.  By that I mean the tablet would not always react where I had touched it, it was delayed in responding to touch, or I would try to drag a page and anything (pictures, links) that was in the way would open.  Recently, these problems have become much more frequent, with the last issue I had being the touch screen was having trouble reacting.  When I turned it on today, the loading screen came up and that was it.  I can't turn it off, can't make it go past the loading screen, and all the rest button does is resets the loading screen and that's it.  And of course the warranty is now expired and I have a $200.00 paperweight laying on the table.  For the limited capabilities of this tablet, and the issues I've had with it I would not recommend buying this to anyone.  I was able to surf the web, play a few games, and use my Kindle app, but that was about it.

And maybe I wouldn't mind that if I could get a functioning replacement.  However, Le Pan's Support Department is TOTALLY UNRESPONSIVE.  I wasted probably a total of 3 hours sitting on hold (no answer, only music and a recording saying how important my call was to them), and my e-mail requests for service have gone unanswered.\nMaybe they've gone out of business and no one told us?"}

I purchased this LePan (in purple though) on 12.14.12 as a Christmas present. I gave it to my wife and after 19 days (from date of purchase 12/14/12) it would not start despite pushing the reset button and start button as recommended. My wife also charged it overnight as well but it still would not start. I sometimes felt it shake when I pressed the power button. I then exchanged it (despite Walmart's 2 week return policy on tablets; the representative was very nice and understood since it was a Christmas gift I could exchange it). I received the tablet around 1.5.13. Now my wife says it does not start again; screen is black, charging it overnight did not solve the problem and doing all the other things previously done did not help. She called Walmart.com and was able to return it after having it for about 1 month. Beware of this product. I did some research online (I took a risk even though some reviews were low but a lot of good reviews were written as well) and this has happened to many others. My wife contacted LePan prior to contacting Walmart.com and they stated that the tablet needed to be shipped at our cost. She even read a review on Amazon and someone returned it 4 times with shipping cost of $18 per time. She was not going to deal with that and called Walmart in hopes of returning and thank goodness they took it back. Yes, this tablet is a 10 inch and really inexpensive; I paid $130 plus tax. You know the old saying, \"You get what you pay for\", this saying shines in this situation. We ended up purchasing a Toshiba Excite and yes it costs $200 more but it got rave reviews and hopefully it will not be like the LePan. We emailed LePan and let them know how horrible their product was. You can take a chance and purchase this product but please know that your are taking a risk. Others reviewed this tablet and loved it but to have the tablet break 2 times shows that it is not made well. Please note my wife takes care of things and did not drop it or anything of that sort."}

I have to admit that the first 6 months were rough as I had to return original tablet. The company is now out of business bc of very bad quality control and customer service. But, since I received a new one and upgraded to Ice Cream 4.0.4, this tablet has been absolutely rock solid. My 2.5 year old uses it for kids games and cartoons. We traveled all over the world, spilled stuff on it, dropped it countless times (I do have a protector leather shell though) and yet it keeps cranking away. Not one issue with charging now nor with the touch screen. Wifi, Bluetooth work great. Just used it for Amazon streaming yesterday in bed. Very good product but too bad company messed up so bad early on. They had something going in terms quality and pricing.\n\n************\nI bought this in March 2012 and one month after purchasing, the tablet would not charge. No answer when I called customer service line and the Le Pan website was down. Finally, I got RMA issued in May and I had to pay $20 out of my own pocket to ship the piece of s*** back. I then waited over a month to get a new one sent back to me. I got the \"new\" tablet in July but 6 months later, it won't hold a charge again. Almost $300 spent on a coaster. Thinking of getting class-action lawsuit against them as thousands are having the same issue. You are warned."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "The Le Pan II was almost completely useless until Ice Cream Sandwich was released for it.  After that it was much better, but the Wifi still didn't work right and there were a number of other bugs.  Le Pan released a firmware fix for these problems.  The firmware fix was poorly identified and it was unclear whether or not it was for this tablet. It turns out that it was for the Le Pan II as well as the Le Pan S, but I was unable to update my tablet because the recovery was broken.\nI tried to call Le Pan support, but was cut off mid call twice and after that there was no answer.  I opened a trouble ticket from the Le Pan support website and recieved an immediate response stating that they would replace my tablet and asking for my address.  I responded with my address and then heard nothing.  I tried to go back to the Le Pan support site, but the link to it no longer worked.  Le Pan support was simply gone.\nAfter two weeks of this crap, I contacted Amazon and told them that Le Pan was not supporting the warranty on my tablet. Amazon was gracious enough to accept a return of the tablet even though it was well outside the Le Pan return policy. Amazon applies a restocking fee to all returned items after the thirty day window.  I only needed to contact Amazon and remind them that the item was defective and the restocking fee was also refunded.\nWhat have I learned from all this? Never buy a Le Pan product.  Since all this I discovered that there are a number of inexpensive Chinese tablets that being made in the same manufacturing facilities as the well known brands. Many of these brands are well known Chinese brands that have an excellent reputation. I have preordered an Ainol-Novo Captain for $220. It should be shipped in March. The specifications blow away most of the tablets available in the US.  Outside of a few tech weenies, people seem very happy with these less expensive Chinese tablets, and many are buying them for kids to do their homework. If you don't want to spend $400+ for a tablet, there is an alternative."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I have had this tablet for 10 days now.  So far I am impressed.  I've had a first generation iPad since it was first released and my cell phone is an iPhone 4.  This tablet performs better (CPU speed and memory) than my iPad which crashes frequently since the last iOS upgrade. Side by side, there is no noticeable difference between the screen size, image quality, brightness, contrast, etc. between the two devices.  It came with Android 4 (Ice Cream Sandwich).  I have not rooted it, side loaded any applications, or tinkered with it in any way.  In the 10 days I have had it, I have charged the battery twice. I use the device 1.5 to 2 hours a day.  I also purchased a 32GB SD Micro memory card bringing the total memory to 40GB.\n\nI have some movies in MV4 format that I play on the the iPad.  I copied these to the SD card.  At first a message popped up saying it didn't know how to play the MV4 file.  I changed the extensions to MP4 and they play perfectly.  If you haven't heard of HandBrake, Google it.  It's a nice tool to convert DVDs to files that play on portable devices.\n\nI easily configured both my Gmail and corporate Microsoft Exchange mail accounts.\n\nAll the images I have stored in Picasa Web Albums magically appeared in the photo gallery.\n\nI have downloaded dozens of apps from Google Play and/or the Amazon app store.  All run just fine.\n\nIt found and connected to my wireless router with ease.  It shows a half dozen other wireless routers (my neighbors I assume) which neither my iPhone nor iPad detect.\n\nPros: Has a camera, SD Slot, HDMI output (which I will probably never use), auto brightness adjustment.\n\nCons: Volume button is difficult to find.  Google Play doesn't have as many apps as the Apple App Store and there aren't as many Android apps specific to tablets as there are for iPads.\n\nSummary: For ~$250 (including the SD card) I got a great performing tablet with 40GB of storage which is comparable if not better than the 16GB iPad for which I paid $600.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the volume button and because it did not come with headphones.\n\nSide note: I purchased the Blurex leather case/stand for the Le Pan II and it fits perfectly."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I received the product within a reasonable time from seller PST (Poppy Seeds Toms) and was super excited when I received it. This was my 1st tablet. My 17yr old wanted one for Christmas and I thought, 'I am not getting her one without getting myself one'. Like others on here, I researched, read and decided on the one to get. She wanted a 7 inch ( so I purchased another brand for her AGPTek) but I thought I would try this one and see the difference in the 2 and I got me the LePan II.\n\nOut of the box, it was nice and it worked. I have 2 jobs and I like having my smartphone or laptop handy to work when necessary. The Lepan II did that... I was comfortable in my purchase. My daughter AGPTek came and it was ok but not as good as my LePan so I got her a Samsung (which is great by the way), bought anohter AGPTek and gave them to my sisters for Christmas.\n\nEverything was great until mine (the more expensive of them all) just stopped powering on. I was sick for a few days after Christmas and I just laid in the bed and used no type device to do anything. I didn't purchase a case for the tablet so I kept it in the plastic and in the box ( out of fear). I set up for about 1 week, no use at all. I am getting ready to return to work after the holidays and I wanted to begin checking emails and getting up to date... It would not power on. I thought ' it's dead, put it on the charger'. It sat on the charger for 5 hours, and it never came on. I read the suggestions from LePan on their website and other LePan forums and did all they suggested (hit reset, hit pwr for 30 sec,  reset + pwr, reset+ volume up, reset+ volume dwn, reset+ pwr and volume) nothing worked. I then saw someone that said they returned it to Amazon. So I contacted the seller (marketplace), who even gave me something to do (they said, that is the ICS for you), still nothing. I contacted LePan and I was on hold for over an hour, at work! I sent then an email, filled out the form..\n\nI contacted the seler again saying I want a refund.. they told me it was past their 14-15 day policy and that I needed to contact LePan. Well, that policy was not listed, they reference Amazon's policy so Amazon has put in a claim to get me refunded from the seller. The seller and I have gone back and forth as they do not believe that I am telling the truth (first they said, I was past the return point, then they said I probably broke it, then after they received they said it was heavily used and I switched the machine and sent them another one). So on top of this tablet not working, I am being called a crook by the seller.\n\nI am still waiting on that refund, but it hasn't been the 5 business days.\n\nNonetheless, I wanted so bad to like this tablet. I loved the size and I love Androids but after less than 10 days of use, the power shouldn't be the issue. Furthermore, there shouldn't be this many people talking about this same issue. The thing just stopped coming on.\n\nI am an Amazon shopper. I don't like shopping and I hate large crowds, so sitting at my computer and shopping has been my thing. For the past 2 years, I have gone to the store at most 2 times during the Holidays. This experience, with the machine and especially with the seller had me in tears on Monday. I believe in shopping around and getting the best for the best price but my sanity was challenged with this purchase. It is already fearful purchasing online and especially electronic, but to feel hopeless like I have felt for the past 2 weeks with the seller and this machine will push me away. This is ridiculous."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "UPDATE:  5/8/13.  Unfortunately, after three months of use, my third Le Pan TC 970 tablet died.  Amazon replaced this tablet for me twice and I had hoped that after three months of great use from this third tablet, I finally had a tablet that was problem free (NOT SO MUCH!).  Unfortunately, a few months seems to be the life span of these tablets, based on some other reviews I've read and my own.  Feel free to read my comments below, but as my final review, save your money and by a tablet from a more reliable manufacturer.  And by the way, when I finally reached Le Pan, instead of honoring the one year warranty on the TC 970, they wanted me to send them $80 for the Le Pan II.  Obviously, my answer was no.\n\nUPDATE:  3/23/13.  It is now 3/23/13 and so far, so good.  My 3rd Le Pan tablet is working great (so far), no issues whatsoever.  Please note that it is now 2 1/2 months since I contacted Le Pan regarding tablet #2 and they still have not responded.  Thank heavens Amazon stepped up to the plate.  It is also now well after the Amazon 30-day return period so any issues will have to be addressed by Le Pan, but based on their lack of response, and though my current 3rd tablet is working great, I will have to leave my rating as a 1.  I will always be a very happy Amazon customer and I keep coming back.  Wish I could say that about Le Pan.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:\n\nI purchased this tablet based on the hundreds of positive Amazon reviews and also some very good reviews on Youtube.  The price was great and I also wanted the larger size (9.7\") instead of a 7\".  Well, I received my Le Pan TC 970 tablet on 12/24, it worked great until it died on 12/28.  I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement the very next day 12/29 (of course, I returned the 1st tablet to Amazon).  Well, I've had ongoing problems with the second Le Pan TC 970 tablet.  More than 50% of the time, I would press an app (any app) up to 5 or 6 times before it would finally work.  Not just one or two apps, but pretty much any app.  I also had problems with the android keyboard.  Whenever I had to type, I would also have to hit a key anywhere from 5 to 8 times before it responded and instead of a particular letter or number I wanted, an option list of that same letter or number would open with accents over the letter or fractions instead of a number.  Press the X key to close the option list, then a letter or number, and the same thing would happen, over and over and over again.  Instead of my contacting Amazon, on 1/7/13, I called Le Pan and though the voice message said it would be a 7 or 8 minute wait for a live support person, I waited for over an hour and no support person ever answered.  So, I sent an email the same date to tech support informing them of the problems and the 60+ minutes wait on hold with no response.  4 days later (1/11/13), Le Pan finally responded saying they would send me an RMA # (no apology for the 60+ minute wait on hold and no name of the person who responded to my email) to replace my defective tablet.  As of today, 1/16/13 (9 days after I first contacted Le Pan), I have not had either a phone or email response from Le Pan with the RMA #.  So, I called again, the voice message said it would be an 11 minute wait for a live person, and 60+ minutes later, I was still on hold then hung up.\n\nPlease note that my complaint is not with Amazon at all as Amazon has been wonderful.  With no response from Le Pan tech support with the RMA # and no one answering at their customer service/tech support line, I called Amazon, explained the situation and the lack of response from Le Pan, and Amazon, not Le Pan gave me the option of a refund or sending me a 3rd tablet.  Amazon is the greatest, but I wish Le Pan had responded as it is their responsibility to handle this matter, especially since my tablet has a one-year warranty.  Because of so many positive responses, I'm willing to give a 3rd tablet a try and have returned the 2nd Le Pan tablet.  I will have the 3rd Le Pan tablet on 1/18/13 (THANK YOU AMAZON, NOT LE PAN!), but when I finally do hear from LePan, I will let them know about their lousy customer service that sucks big time!"}

At the same time of each purchase I bought special covers, cases, etc. to ensure maximum protection for these items.  Both units were handled carefully, used sparingly, and NEVER mishandled.  They were ALWAYS handled with care.  There were NEVER accidents with either unit.\n\nThe power button ceased functioning (used to \"click\" when turning on, no longer clicks) and at the same time, we found during testing that the battery no longer held a charge. it could stay charging for days without a battery full sign.\n\nWe called the customer service number from the manufacturer to see if some type of special reset could be attempted and we always got either a \"we're closed\" message or they would tell us to hold for 20 minutes and then disconnect at varying times.  the longest it kept us on hold was a little over 2 hours, but usually would disconnect us between 45 minutes to an hour.  We NEVER made it past the automated hold system.  We tried leaving a post via the manufacturer website but it would never accept the post on submission.\n\nThe poor craftsmanship and complete lack of customer service doesn't even warrant a single star.  The unit will function sufficiently for the limited time it works but if you are expecting a unit that will last more than a month or few, then look elsewhere.  This unit is a waste of money.\n\nWe are still trying to get resolution after weeks of fruitless effort and have never successfully managed communication with the manufacturer.

So far no problems.\n\nThe tablet has several quirks: you can't uninstall preloaded apps. You must use third party apk sites (like getjar) for downloading apps (google play DOES NOT support this tablet). Some of the internal apps are wonky at best (chrome browser is crash-prone - use opera). The power button must be held for 7 seconds to power on 5 to power down & 3 to lock screen. The hold button locks the screen auto rotate function. Wireless and bluetooth work great with no problems.\n\nI bought a bluetooth keyboard and it works. The tablet also syncs with my cellphone and laptop - I can send/recieve files no problem. After bricking my former tablets (dropping, rough handling, using while plugged in, exposed to extreme temps) I'm more careful with these fragile machines. NOT recommended for children!"}

It does the same thing with youtube & other video formats.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "UPDATE: I have now had three solid months of use out of the LePan. I have had NO PROBLEMS with it other than some of my dislikes from my ealier post. Since writing my initial post, my son (3 years old) watched movies which we transfered over from our computer for much of our 10 hour trip to Ireland (waiting in airports and flights) and it still had about 30% battery life with no additional charging needed. I am sure running wifi and bluetooth would significantly reduce this. Looking for a cheap tablet for entertainment and that you don't mind your kids using, this is one way to go.\n\nI have found the apps in the android market for word processing are a little clunky and unfortunatley as a teacher in a school that uses Microsoft Word, the interchange is not so smooth all the time. I can work much quicker (editing, creating, inserting tables, diagrams, etc) using my Lenovo ThinkPad and therefore have not actually used the tablet for work.\n\nInitial Reivew (First Few Weeks):\nPicked this up as a Cyber Monday Week deal from Amazon ($150). Purchased this for more of an entertainment tablet, but still to do a little work email/word processing, etc. Price went back up to $250. I would imagine price will keep dropping after December.\n\nPros:\n- Cost\n- Netflix, Facebook, and other apps work great\n- Came with ICS installed\n- Easy work around to download and install Adobe Flash Player\n- Solid build for a cheap tablet\n- Bluetooth and wifi works as good if not better than my iphone 4, no problems so far as others report.\n- Easy connection to computer through bluetooth direct connect and also through supplied transfer cable.\n-\nNot good/Not Bad:\n- Battery Life (not the same as other tablets, but I adjusted the setting and can get 6 hours or so of heavy use -- wifi, websurfing, bluetooth (keyboard), netflix and email no problem. But for my needs, I can't imagine needing 6 hours of heavy use very often with out being able to plug in and charge.\n\nCons:\n- No USB port for plugging in keyboard, USB flash drive, etc. (This was big for me, but have quickly gotten use to the fact that I need to use work arounds).\n- Tablet WON'T charge connected to USB port in computer.\n- Hard to find case (see below) and the cases I could find were more expensive compared to same brand for ipad.\n- Costly replacement cable, planning on being very careful of mine.\n\nNote: BEWARE of keyboard/case combinations that Amazon links with the LePan. I read many reviews before buying and many of them either do not work or need modifications. I purchased the Kensington Universal Pro Keyfolio (bluetooth) case and keyboard. A little costly but I have been very happy with this addition. Had it set up in minutes and my tablet works great with all ports/buttons open while fitting snug in the tabs. Maybe not as snug as other brands, but I have not had any slippage or felt uncomfortable with it. It is also easy to pop out when you want just the tablet. Highly recommend this purchase with the LePan."}

I don't have that kind of time anymore and find when I need it, it's either not connected to wifi, or has turned itself on and is dead.\n\nI'm sure there are fixes for these things if I invest a lot of personal time in the forums which provide a lot of detail, but as I say I don't have the time anymore.\n\nThat said, I did get some good use out of it, and it was very inexpensive so I can't complain.  And now it has a second live as a wifi picture frame that automatically downloads pics from my Picasa \"best of\" album (so long as I connect it to wifi every now and then).

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "We purchased 2 of these tablets, one for each child. One of the two arrived with the power button already missing (rattling around inside the unit). We sent that back to Amazon for a quick and painless replacement.\n\nThe other broke, again the power button, 6 months later. We sent that one back to Vizio/LePan under the 1 year warranty. I was only expecting them to find/replace the missing power button, but instead they sent a brand new unit as a replacement.\n\nIf you Google this tablet, you find that it is common for the button to fall off (fall inside) because it is note attached to anything, just held in place by the front/back panel pressure. It seems that they have fixed this in later models, so maybe the problem is no longer an issue...\n\nIf not for the button, I would give this tablet 5 stars. As it is, the excellent warranty (1 year) and the fact that LePan honors it, gives the table a strong 4 stars.\n\nAbout the tablet itself:\n\nThe size is just a tick bigger than an iPad (my wife has an iPad). I would argue that the added size makes it easier for the kids to hold to. I also like the camera-like wrist strap that comes with it (optional to install). We have put the straps on and tell the kids to keep the strap around their wrist to avoid accidentally dropping.\n\nThe screen is the right size for a media tablet. The display is outstanding; it is much better than the iPad. Very bright and the colors pop.\n\nThe cpu can get a little taxed when trying to do too many things at once (e.g. download apps and play a game or video at the same time). Most of the time (95%) is has plenty of power for everything that the kids use it for (games, e-mail, video, internet, etc.)."}

I am very frustrated and disappointed with the level of service provided by Lepan support team!"}

There has been no abuse to the use of these tablets -in less than a year- that we have had them. My son's power button quit working - making it useless, my screen colors have gone crazy, no black - it has red shades where the black should be and hurts your eyes to look at it, and my mother's has operating issues.  They are cheap units - Making repair - to this point impossible - to find.  Having purchased through Amazon, the 3 month warranty is useless as well.  I will never buy this brand again, nor would I reccommend anyone else doing the same.  Very unhappy with the package."}

When we received the new tablets they froze up on the first download. Now, 1 of them will not even turn on or reset. We have had them for 4 days. Stay far far away from Le Pan and their crummy tablets. Not worth the hassles!!! Will be trying to reach Le Pan again tomorrow. : o(\n\nUpdate we sent back these tablets and received new tablets around December 12 (give or take) Then right before Christmas the \"new\" tablets are both not turning on at all.

I have to say I am disappointed in this tablet. I read every review I could find before making this purchase and they were mostly very good but I did not find that to be the case with what I received. First, I must tell you I had to return the first LePan TC970 I bought because it would not hold a charge and then it would not charge at all. It constantly froze and had to be reset in order to get it working again. In the end it wiped out everything in the file manager after having to be reset yet again so I returned it for another one. The second one also freezes but not as often. So far I have not lost anything due to resetting. It also has trouble keeping a charge if not used regularly. For example, if I fully charge it but don't use it for several days it will be dead when I try to turn it on and will have to recharge it again before being able to use it. I have realized that it must be kept on the charger whenever not in use. It's the only way to ensure it will be usable when I need it. I would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "The TC 970 Is a great device, so long as you can live with its flaws. (And it does have them) this device is very prone to Freezing. There is a reset button on the back of the device under power that will get you running again.\n\nSometimes you might run into an issue with it freezing if you connect it to your pc (Also Your PC will not charge your device it must be from the 2.0A wall charger an ipad charger outputs about the same and a ipad cable can work if you shave down alittle of the plastic sides ON THE END OF THE CABLE not the device alternatively inside the power jack on the lepan there is a tiny metal tab that you can bend back and the normal ipad cable will fit without shaving anything.) If you go under settings/application/development and check mark (Stay Awake) that should stop it from freezing from usb to pc hookup.\n\nSome users have had the device go to sleep and not want to turn back on (Sometimes the lepan needs you to press and hold the power button the hit the reset before releasing the power) under settings/display/screen timeout set it to 30 minutes and put it to sleep manually.\n\nFor those of you who now have a paper weight (Device won't turn on no matter what and you're out of warranty) this device seems to have a weak battery jack. My lepan was second hand and I was having all sorts of issues (Device was freezing it would not charge fast/right had problems turning on etc.) I decided just to check the battery. So I got a little Philips head and flat head screw driver (Under the micro sd tab THERE ARE TWO SCREWS THAT MUST BE REMOVED carefully disconnect the back cover from the lepan I find the far end (Away from the power button) to be the easiest place for me to start (The hold switch and volume key can come out so be careful) the battery jack is located on the side the power button is. Mine must have come loose in transit it was a full quarter inch out of the socket after pushing it back in and putting a small piece of electrical tape over it my Lepan worked much better did not freeze as much charged and power on like it was suppose to.\n\nI don't know why this device freezes so much. It does seem related to the wifi in some way, does not freeze nearly as much with wifi turned off. Anyway I hope this review helps some fellow Le Pan TC 970 users, most of this info comes from me spending hours searching through forums."}

I upgraded to ICS and it was breeze. Let me tell you I have two laptops,one china made cheap tab and one samsung galaxy 7'' wifi. The china made tab that i had earlier was a piece of junk so when I ordered lepan 2 , i thought I am making same mistake again but NO!!!! It was way beyond my expectation.\nI took this because 7'' screen was too small for me at work. But this one is just perfect. The resolution is just mind blowing its as good as an ipad only less expensive. I should thank le pan guys for making technology affordable. It snapy fast, leaves even my galaxy tab far behind which has a 1 Gig of processor.\n\nOnly minor flaw is the volume rocker ..too flat to identify it. A USB port would have been a added bonus.

My friend had this attractive tablet and it prompted me to get one as well. Well she and I both are having to send it back and she is sending hers for the 2nd time within a 2 months! The screen constantly freezes and that is with 1 application open. Watching Youtube in HD will make it freeze instantly and when it does you must press reset on the back. Well, I am no rocket scientist,but I do not think that is how an electronic device should function. I am figuring this is a known glitch and something Le Pan should fix. Well she got her \"repaired\" tablet back and needless to say, it is going back after having back only a month. I believe the constant resetting causes the unit to short out because it went dead and never came back on. Save yourself the money and if you are looking for a cheaper tablet go to a chain store and get a cheaper one from there because I have one that was about $80 and it still works fine. For this to cost what it does and constantly short out and the cheap one to still work fine after 2 years should tell you something. Have fun getting your money back because that won't happen and their customer service is terrible. They talk to you like its your problem but there are many complaints Le Pan that say different.

Very Affordable compared to I Pad, Samsung (really good quality but price $600+ !).\n2. Lot cheaper than Nook or Kindle (they are even smaller screen size, with higher price).\n3. Excellent design. Good engineering quality in the Tablet Model itself.\n4. Very thin and light. Nice finish.\n5. Compared to other Tablet (All \"Class C\" Tablets), will give you a competitive quality, with reasonable price. (Unlike I Pad / Samsung, Share Price minded price tag !)\n6. You can add up to 32 GM Micro SD Card (I did too).\nCons:\n1. Possessor is extreme slow, although it says 1 Ghz.\n2. Memory is only 256 MB (less than 10 years old Computer). You need I MB atleast.\n3. Internet access is slow, even if your are have 40 MBPS connection.\n4. You can watch Netflix, without any problem. CNN, YouTube streamline video works with slow connectivity.\n5. The Tablet freezes many times, only option, having a Paper Clip, handy to pock on the back side \"reset\" opening.\n6.  \"Le Pan Customer Service\" is horrible..! Only option to contact, by e-mail, which they with hardly reply back. At least I don't see any of my issue answered.\nMy suggestion, you may first try Le Pan 970 II, at $250. It ought to be better than Le Pan 970..  If that does not work for you, call Amazon Customer Service that tell them you want you buy a \"Samsung\". Amazon will replace.\n\nHope this helps !"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I give this product a one star rating because -5 is not available. The tablet showed up from Amazon, and it seemed to do okay for about two months (30-days after the 30-day Amazon warranty expired). I took a chance on this tablet, know this device could be unstable, but I knew I wasn't going to use it very often. As it turns out, I did begin to depend upon it greatly, 6-months after my purchase, it just stopped working. I called Amazon and they referred me to the manufacturer.\n\nFirst things first, let's get the tablet review out of the way. As I said, it seemed to do okay the first 2-months, and then it became unstable. I understood that this operating system was not upgradable to Gingerbread, and I was okay with that.\nWhen I say it was unstable, I mean it lost internet connection frequently, forced closing apps, browser issues, etc. I understand that apps can be unstable on any device, but the most annoying was how it would lose internet connection from my Wi-Fi every time I used it. I would have to go through an 8-step series of steps to get back to where I was on the internet after losing connection. My daughter who also has an Android tablet (EVO view) did not suffer the same issues while using her tablet at the very same time. During the time I have owned this device, I have had to perform over five factory reboots.\n\nLet's say you were okay with the fact it is a low quality device, maybe you think \"well, it's less than $200, you get what you pay for\", you would be right! The only problem with this is that the customer service for LePan, which is who Amazon referred me to after explaining that there was a manufacturer alert for this product, is equally as unstable as the device they manufacture! I am still not sure why Amazon does not send out alerts on the products you purchase from them, after all, they send you everything else under the that have nothing to do and sometimes everything to do with products you purchase from them.\n\nAnyway, Amazon gave me the customer service number to contact LePan, and it took several phones to get through the first time. It was an automated voice recording (not a touch-system), and either it would re-loop the recording over and over again an insane number of times (in English, as well as Spanish), and the finally putting you out of misery by hanging up on you. You should know that during my time dealing with them for three weeks now, I have had repeated situations like this occur.\n\nAt first, when getting a hold of a human, I explained what was transpiring and they referred me to their web site to fill out a claim form. The only problem with this is that my tablet no longer worked and I did not have access to the internet anymore! The representative explained that the device would have to be replaced, and that I would have to arrange and pay for the return of this device. Just so you are aware and you do not heed the advice in this post, it was over $26 to ship.\n\nThe first night of making contact with them, my daughter came by with her laptop so I could set up a case to begin the process or the line of communication so I thought. It has been three weeks now, and I still do not have a replacement tablet. I found out through UPS (who are just as bad as LePan), that they had in fact delivered the defective tablet to LePan on the 10th, and still no tablet or sign of a tablet. I have written numerous times within their case system. So far, my inquiries have been met with either silence or silly questions like, \"what is your shipping address\", and in todays phone message \"we have some more questions\". You should know that when I filled out a case, I put in my shipping address, when I shipped the device back; it was tied to an RMA, which included my shipping address. When I shipped the device back, I included a manifest that contained my RMA, the Case # and my (drum roll please) .... Shipping Address!\n\nYour take away from this should be: Do not purchase this product because it is poorly manufactured and the vendor is irresponsible and unreliable.\n\nYou should know that I do not have a negative view against everyone and everything. I am a little baised towards UPS and prefer Fed-Ex or USPS. I purchased from Amazon because of their liberal return policy. DO NOT COUNT ON THAT FOR THIS PRODUCT. I will still purchase from Amazon, but I will try to purchase the more expensive products in person, locally. I have recently purchased and IPad 2 that I am really loving now. The gentleman at the Apple store was knowledgeable and my experience there was a delight.\n\nI am exhausted, but I will keep you up to date. Thanks for reading and I hope this helps."}

This is a great product and the ONLY thing holding it back in any way is its lack of familuarity in name.\nI expect this company to continue to do great things and build on its reasonably priced products... if I could buy stock in Le Pan I would."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "Late 2012 UPDATE:  Looks like the new price isn't coming down anytime soon.  Dropping from four stars to three, because once you get near the $200 price point, there are probably better options...\n\n-----\n\nOk, so a couple of weeks back I picked one of these up for a buck thirty, right here.  A few days later, it listed for a buck fifty!  And now, a buck eighty?!  I mean, yeah, the tablet's actually pretty good (for a second-tier FroYo unit), but with its current price volatility, you might want to consider either other models or other vendors.\n\nAs for specs, this one is a PDF reader's dream.  Well, ok, a 15\" borderless unit would be perfect, but realistically, this is quite a solid runner-up, and a bargain (at least at its former price).  Yeah, it'll play video games, but remember, it runs FroYo (Android 2.2), so the OS is old, and I have no inclination to try upgrading it.  Frankly, I don't even see a need to root it.  If you just consider it a giant Kindle with the Google Play store installed, you'll be pleased as punch with it.  With the current incarnation of Adobe's PDF reader app, if you set the page-view to \"Continuous,\" there's no need to reflow anything.\n\nOther than the occasional freeze or lockup, which frankly happens to all 2nd-tier units at some time or another, the only real issue I've encountered (and I think this may be the issue in some of the negative reviews here) is that you ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO charge the battery fully before using it.  It comes a bit precharged, and the battery life is great (which probably explains the heaviness), but if you let the power run all the way down, the thing won't power up enough to even start a proper recharge cycle for like an hour.  It's a PITA, but the fix is easy--just don't ever let the battery level drop below ~15%.  And speaking of charging, it takes quite a while, and the socket's proprietary, but rumor has it you can use a standard 15-pin iPod charging cable, if you shave off a bit of plastic from the sides.  I've never tried, but honestly, LePan sells replacement cords for so cheap, why bother?\n\nOther things:  Remember, it's running FroYo, so NO EQUALIZER.  (Sux if you're an audiophile.)  Also, it'll fit an iPad case just fine, but the I/O holes and button spaces won't line up, so be prepared to use a scissors on the case if you go this way.\n\nSo in a nutshell, for a buck-thirty, LePan's TC-970 is a great PDF reader.  At its buck-eighty inflated price, though, you might as well check out some 1st-tier tabs that run 4.0+ (Ice Cream Sandwich, Jellybean, etc.)."}

Same recorded message ran over and over so their customer support is non existence in my opinion.\n\nDo not waste your money on this item or buy anything from this company. I plan on sending it back without a RMA number and going from there as I have nothing to lose at this point.\n\nUPDATE: Tried a few more times to reach Le Pan with the same results, nothing. Tried emailing them for a RMA number, no reply. Contacted Amazon and they told me to send it back and they will send me a new one! Great customer service from Amazon but that doesnt change my mind about Le Pan's product or customer service (or lack of)."}

And if you need more room, load another 32gb card (or 2) and you can have a huge movie catalog to go without having to use wifi. Oh yeah, and you still have 8gb built in...

No Skype makes it a 4 out of 5 but reliable and fast RDP connection brings it back to a 5 out of 5. I can log into my work PC and take this light little baby instead of a hefty laptop.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "Thursday, August 30 2012 - 08:54 AM - UPDATE: Amazon shipped my new LePad and this time the charger works flawlessly. Amazon has been FANTASTIC to work with which is why they are ALWAYS my first stop to buy anything online.  I with I could say the same for the folks who  make LePad - The directions say that once I plug my LePad into the USB port on my computer it will show up as a drive. Well, it doesn't and never has. It runs some installation program which LePad just says to accept automatically and the LePad will show up as a drive but that never happens. There isn't a CD/DVD in the LePad box with the drivers and when I go out to the LePad website it takes a long time to find any download and then when you find it, its not the drivers, its a bunch of games and legacy junk in huge zip files that doesn't do squat to help me connect to my computer so I can begin transferring all my music, pdf's, and gigs of stuff over to my LePad so I can use it forever!  I am going to try and call LePad and see if they will take their phone off \"busy signals\" long enough to help me. If they don't help get this beast connected to my pc, I will return it and buy a KINDLE FIRE and be done with it!\n\nFriday, August 24 2012 - 07:43 AM - I have my LePan for about 3 days.  First, before you judge this Le Pan too harshly understand that mine was problematic right from the start yet Amazon is in the process of sending me a brand new one. I don't believe the one I originally received was \"new\". I noticed this from the second I opened the box; you just \"know\" this was purchased and used by someone else and returned because of the way the box has been \"repackaged\". First the DVD/CD was not in the box so I was never able to sync the Le Pan with my PC. I tried downloading the drivers yet they were HUGE, in a zip file and did not contain an .exe or startup file. Also when you read the \"fine print\" and \"legal disclaimers\" you are terrified if you proceed forward to sync the Le Pan with your computer. It was my understanding that as soon as I connected my LePan, via USA to my computer, it would show up as a disk named \"LePan\" and \"BINGO\" you are off and xferring file.\n  Also, this system did not hold a charge while it was playing. Example: plugged in to wall and should be trickle charging while playing and it's actually telling me that it's not even plugged in! Then I turned it completely off to charge and it went from 10% to 17% and automatically turned back on; even after I told it to \"shut down\" and not \"sleep\".  It's possessed I tell you. \"Carolann - don't look into the light\".\n  I will be reporting back once I receive my new one as I am confident this was a good purchase. You don't constantly get 4+ stars if you a piece of junk.  I remain hopeful.  \"I'll Be Back\".\n\nUPDATE: Friday, August 24 2012 - 10:40 PM = Thankfully Amazon is shipping my new La Pan and I am praying to the computer Gods that this one works. This existing unit has been charging for a good 34 hours and is only at 26% so there are additional issues here. Also my NFL APP freezes and no longer runs on this unit so I'm sans football on this unit which is one of main reason I bought it; although it's only preseason.  I'd really like to stay with the Android O/S yet if this new one that is coming isn't flawless, I might have to wait for a tablet PC which just runs the MicroSoft Windows 8. This is frustrating when Apple seems to be the only Tablet that works yet is so expensive and my entire business software is set up for PC's."}

It's the fourth tablet (and third Android) I've purchased, but after having become accustomed to the Le Pan II and Android 4.0, this is absolutely painful to use.

The build quality is great, and it gets the job done.  I just can't _ever_ see preferring this over even the Netbook sitting about the house.  Do yourself a favor, and spring for the Le Pan II which is an amazing and wonderful tablet, or if funds are an issue, spend a little more and get a Nexus 7.

I expected a lot of problems because of the price, but I have not had any real problems. The Wifi problems were fixed with the update, and beside a couple of times I had to restart it, it has been awesome. The tablet is extremely fast for a tablet thanks to the top of the line specs. The ability to use an SD card is very much under rated. You can add 32gb to the tablet without having to pay hundreds more. Here are a few things I have noticed about the Le Pan II Tablet:\n\nPROS:\n\n1.) Amazingly Fast. Almost Instant responses on everything I do. The Processor is one of the fastest you will find for any price.\n\n2.) SD Card Slot= Alows you to expand the memory by 32gb without having to pay hundreds more like on iPads. You also can interchange cards with movies and TV shows without worrying about filling up your hard drive.\n\n3.) PRICE= The best price I have seen for a tablets with this size screen and processor.\n\n4.) Screen = Same size as iPad. cant find a tablet this new with same screen size for the price. You can watch movies at angle. I cant tell any difference between watching a movie starring right at the center of the screen vs watching it with my eyes looking right at the side. On my laptop I am constantly trying to adjust the screen position to get a clearer image. Images are extremely bright and clear. HD looking resolution for movies. Love the Color.\n\n5.) Dont have to mess with iTunes\n\n6.) BATTERY LIFE= I was amazed with the battery life i got with this tablet. I watched more than 7 hours of netflix without having to dim my screen or recharge. Recharging seems to take a long time though.\n\nCONS:\n1.) App Store= tons of apps but just not the number of apps that you can find on ipad but more than you can find on a kindle fire. It still has all the major aps you can find on apple store like netflix, pandora, kindle app, AutoCAD, Facebook, Twitter, and many many more. TONS of games for kids though.\n\n2.) Speakers = Speakers don't seem to be that loud even with the sound on max. I normally use ear phones anyways so that has never been a problem with me.\n\nOVERALL\nYou cant beat the price for the quality you are getting. The tablet upgrates to Android Ice Cream Sandwich. It is hundreds and hundreds of dollars cheaper than ipad and matches it on ever spec and more. It is just a little over the price of kindle fire but with a much larger screen. It is cheap in price but definitely not cheap in quality. I cant believe I don't see more of these out there."}

I came across the LePan and decided to give it a shot after purchasing about 3 different cheaper Android Tablets.  I had a hell of a time trying to get apps to run on the cheaper tablets and finally bit the bullet and got the LePans.  We love them.  It was a fantastic decision.  My kids use them basically to play Angry birds and my oldest is always reading and listening to music on them.  We did not try to Skype or stream videos or anything, so I cannot really comment on those capabilities.  My oldest also uses it to go online at home to do her HW.  The kids take them in the car with them all the time so it has really cut down on the back seat bickering!  YEAH!!!  In the house, 2400 SQFT two levels, we've never had a problem connecting to our WiFi network.  They've also worked perfectly well in hotels.  I've never tried them anywhere else.  BTW, I knew we would not be buying Ipads due to the cost, so my criteria was something that could play games, let them do their HW in the kitchen, let them read and listening to music was very important.  They've delivered on all accounts.  I was not too concerned with being able to upgrade them.  I figured for the price, it was exactly what we needed.  HTH!!"}

Moving an Icon from one area to another spot on the page and it disappears or dumps it in the trash. Kind of aggravating.\nBut for the most part it's pretty descent for the price of $130.\nSolid built tablet with strong glass, little on the heavy side, battery last a real long time.\nVolume buttons can be a little tough to find as they are buried behind the screen, wished it had a volume control on the screen.\nNice large screen, especially easy on the eyes for viewing videos and emails."}

I am currently an owner of an Ipad which I truly enjoy. I was looking for something less exspensive for my husbands birthday.  The majority of the reviews were very positive, I was a little hesitant, but also excited because of all of the features described.  Out of the box it looked and felt great, but soon after that, I realized it \"ain't no Ipad\".  It would have a full battery, and 100% wifi signal, but would say no signal.  It would be fully charged, but would not come on. I had to reset it weekly.  I would use my Ipad at the same time as my husband attempted to use the le pan, but he wouldn't be able to get a signal, or it just wouldn't turn on at all. We use the pads to surf the internet and read email mostly. The le pan performes poorly at these simple task.  I was very disappointed, and upset with myself for wasting my money. I should have saved it and purchased the Ipad.  I could not in good conscious recommend this product to anyone."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I am so disappointed in this tablet. I researched the heck out of tablets before I bought. The Le Pan II seemed to get really good reviews, even from people with techie backgrounds. Mine was a dud. The tablet has a good heft, and the screen is very responsive. That's the best I can say about it. I charged it fully before using, as per recommendations on Le Pan specific forums. My first complaint was that it had this weird LED type red line that radiated across the screen from the charging port all the way to the opposite side during the initial charge. Once it was working I noticed that it randomly opened and closed apps from the get go. I had a whole list of apps I wanted to download. Most of them from google play. I would say 90% of the apps worked okay. The other 10% were disappointing. Either they would simply close out, wouldn't work correctly, or wouldn't work at all. I had also read that I could download from Amazon's android app store....not. I bought one app that my kids have been wanting, it simply didn't work at all. I would try to open it and it would turn the screen black, then reset to the home screen. 99 cents down the tube on that one. I tried uninstalling and re-installing several times, no go. Then I decided to test a free app from Amazon. I did \"Where's My Water\" lite. Well, it works, only the alligator isn't visible. Sound is fine, response is fine, game works like it should, but you can hear but NOT SEE the character. Oooookay <eye roll> I did enjoy the Kindle app, as well as the fact that I could use both Nook and Kindle on one device.\n\nToday, I tried to turn it on and...nothing. I finally gave up and plugged it to the charger. Then it would turn on. The battery, once on, said it was 85% full, so it should have worked OFF THE CHARGER. I did notice that the charging port was installed on a diagonal slant to the actual hole in the product, not good. I used the tablet on the charger for a bit, then decided to turn it off and try to restart it off the charger. When I turned it off I heard this high pitched squealing. It lasted for about a minute and then stopped. Again, trying to turn on the tablet while disconnected from the charger, I was disappointed to find out that it would not turn on. At that point, I hopped on my laptop to initiate a return to Amazon. Thank goodness for their STELLAR customer service. I am getting a full refund on the tablet, as well as the Le Pan specific case and screen protector that I had purchased for it. No need for them, I won't waste more time on a Le Pan product. I bought this primarily to use for therapy and tutoring apps for my special needs son. I also wanted to incorporate it into our homeschool lessons for my other two children. I need the tablet to work, correctly, EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I need it to work ALL. THE. TIME.\n\nI bought this because I could purchase the tablet (with room to add memory), the case, and the screen protector for about what I'd expect to pay for the lowest memory iPad, refurbished. In hindsight, that probably should have been a red flag. I will be using my refund to purchase a refurbished iPad (I'm trying to scrape up a bit more to afford the mid level memory) as I have an iPhone that has worked correctly, without falter or fail, for almost 2 years.\n\nThere are options the Le Pan offered that I'll miss. Flash Player for one. The streaming is also VERY smooth, the movie we watched (partially, before the tablet just refused to work at all) was flawless. Much better than the graphics of movies when watched on a Kindle Fire. This tablet COULD HAVE (should have?) done everything I needed...but it didn't do anything I needed, in the end. As angry as I am that Apple won't offer a way to expand memory, and a way to use Flash Player, I will suck it up and buy Apple again.\n\nThanks, Amazon, for at least making it right for me by giving me my money back."}

I can not watch HD videos on Youtube.  When I attempt to watch HD Youtube video the tablet just buffers, and buffers, and buffers.  The buffering issue is so annoying I just give up trying to watch the video, search for another video, get more annoying buffering, etc., and never get the experience of viewing HD Youtube video on the tablet!  Now, if I watch non-HD video (film quality of non-HD is horrible) I am forced to watch super poor quality, fuzzy looking film.\n\nI used to be thrilled about this tablet.  My view of this tablet has taken a 180 degree turn in the opposite direction.  I do not recommend this tablet at all.  I thought by saving money and choosing this cheaper tablet I got a great deal.

I was trying to decide if a Kindle Fire or a Nook would be better for me then I cam across Ernest's review.  I decided to try it out and have been very happy with it.  I have the Kindle and Nook apps downloaded into my Le Pan so this has reinforced my decision to go with the Le Pan II.  I also love that there is an app (free I might add) that is compatible with Microsoft Office (word, pp, excel, etc) which makes it very convenient for me to do school papers when I am not at home.\nThere are so many apps to choose from.  The android technology is very easy to get accustomed to.  I had a set back when trying to download my music, but as long as you use Google Music to sync (can be used with iTunes) and then make sure to mark the music as being accessible offline...all is good.\nI love that it will accept up to a 32GB memory card which expands the memory capabilities tremendously.  I think the only two things I would add is a camera on the back (in addition to the one on the front) and a USB slot that will accept thumb drives.  I know there is the microSD card slot, but having a thumb drive would make backing up work a little easier when in a rush.\nI have played Netflix and it is awesomely clear and no lag time.  As long as there is internet available (wifi) the connection and response time are great.  Would also love to see an internet slot meant for mobile internet as well as see Le Pan offer a great monthly internet on the go subscription.  You know, maybe something that is like a wireless air card that could be inserted for anywhere access to internet...maybe the new Le Pan (future) tablets should have two thumb drives...one for memory back up and one for internet access ($10 a month would be awesome...hint, hint).  I would much rather prefer to take and use my Le Pan on the go rather than my laptop computer.\nI know there will be many tweeks and updates as customers list their likes and don't likes.  I am 100% satisfied with my tablet and don't even think of an iPad or any other tablet now.  This was exactly (and more) what I wanted and will be staying with Le Pan from now on.\nThank you for making such a great product and an affordable price.  :D"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "First of all, let me say this tablet connected perfectly to both the wifi at work, and my portable hot spot. Everything about the tablet worked flawlessly including accessing the \"Google play\" store. If that were the end of the story, I would have given it 5 stars with no hesitation at all.\n\nThe reason I gave it 4 stars, and am returning it is that it will not connect to my home wifi.\n\nThe following is a brief description of my efforts, and conclusion written for any fellow techno geeks as kind of a courtesy: I have Clear (formally Clearwire) for my home ISP. I use a combination box from Clear that serves as both the tranceiver, and wireless router. It works fine with my laptops, Kindle Fire, and Ipod. I tried two different encryption protocols AND open (unsecured). In each case I got my laptop back on the internet, but could not get the Le Pan II tablet to communicate with the wifi network. (The Le Pan II continually cycles between \"connecting\", & \"searching\".)  I tried both with automatic settings, and manually entering static network IP address, and several IP addresses that were open, and in the range of the Clear device. My conclusion (best guess) of the culprit is the MAC address which the Le Pan ii uses to identify itself. According to tech support at Clear (and my own searching through the Clear tranceiver/router settings) there is no way to turn off or alter it's filtering for MAC addresses. Which I read is possible on other wifi routers (Lynksys for example.)If anyone has a better theory, I welcome the input in response to this review to aid any future buyers of this tablet that may have similar difficulty.\n\nI also want to say Amazon customer service was absolutely a dream come true. I talked to a lady on the phone last night, and she authorized my return with great compassion, and understanding. As a result I have already placed an order from Amazon for a different tablet (Asus TF300) which I am hopeful will not have the issue I experienced with the Le Pan II."}

She uses her ipod touch all the time and I rarely have used my tablet.  The biggest reason is that I can't receive a wifi signal in my living room.  We've never had a problem with any other laptops getting the signal there, and my wife can even take her ipod outside and still receive the signal.  The browser is also considerably slower than the browser of any of our laptops for searching the internet.  Finally today the on/off switch on the tablet broke so that I can no longer turn it on.  I plan to send it back to be fixed, so if that doesn't go well, I may lower the rating.\n\nOn the plus side, the screen looks very nice.  It is easy to use.  The speakers are very impressive!

I tried holding the power button for at least 3-5 seconds for a chance to make it work, but it didn't. I figured there's a problem with the internal battery, 'cause you can only use it whenever it's plugged! This product is defective. I returned this again and ask for a refund.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "This is the third tablet I've purchased, largely on the strength that it's Google certified against the Play store.  I had an Acer Iconia that I wound up giving to my father in law.  I purchased a Nook Tablet and returned it after a week.  This?  It's actually replaced the numerous laptops and Kindles around the domicile as my primary information consumption device.  It's not perfect.  Sometimes Flash buffering is quirky, and there are a number of apps that just plain don't work, usually obscure games I don't care about.  I really miss having Swype, which is apparently incompatible due to the screen form factor.  I think in the end, why I like it so much is because of the form factor.  9.7 inches is just right for holding in one hand while having easy readability and UI spacing, and it's all without Apple's suffocating user experience.  The biggest advantage over the 7\" form factor?  PDFs.  I go to a lot of conferences with materials in PDF format, and seven inches is not going to cut it.  I move documents and e-books into my Dropbox on any PC and it opens with zero fuss seconds later.  Try that with iOS.  I've had an iPhone, Android phones, and even a terrible XP tablet at work back in the day.  Using this is a pleasure, and you get a lot of bang for your buck.\n\nUPDATE 7/30/2012\nUpgraded to the official Android 4.0.4 release a couple of weeks ago.  Still have access to the Google Play store, and still pleased as punch.  It runs somewhat faster, battery life lasts a LOT longer, and a number of app issues that existed under Honeycomb have been fixed.  A free Swype analogue is too be had with TouchPal Keyboard.  I've been comparing it to the iPad 2s some folks have at work, and wouldn't trade it for a second.  The advantage of DropBox and its local LAN sync plus custom third party apps over the iOS world really cannot be overstated."}

I made the purchase on Feb. 8th 2012. Right out of the box it had charging problems but after left charging for over 24 hours it worked fine as long as it was always charged. If the battery ran 3/4 of the way down the tablet would just shut off and not turn back on till it was fully charged the next day. I should of sent it back right then and there but I chose to ignore it because it would work fine again. My wife enjoyed using the tablet for the Kindel  books and Pinterest. No games were ever played on it. It was well taken care of. Well fast forward to 6/25/2012 6:44 PM. My wife hands me the tablet and says it is falling apart. I look at it and the screen is popping up and on the bottom edge the seam is coming apart. I first attempted to call the warranty hotline and was told that all operators were busy and to file a claim online. Well I did that at the e-mail that was provided on their warranty page. I sent a picture in with the email and was referred to open a ticket through the website. I did that and was given a response that the sent my case was being sent to their corporate office.

As I have indicated before there is no damage done to the case. The screen came popped up because of.the buldge at the bottom of the tablet. I am smart enough not to pry open a 4 month old tablet. Heck even my 5 year is smart enough not to do that. please tell me of any other way I could have done this and not show ANY damage.\n\nLePan Support on 6/28/2012 1:08 PM\nJohn,\nOur apologies that you feel this is unjust. Having issued thousands of units, fielded thousands of support cases, and replaced a number of damaged units, none of the previous cases have ever fallen apart as your tablet has. This decision was not made lightly, and we consulted the highest of possible authorities within the company. Their determination was that your tablet appears to have been mishandled, and someone likely attempted to pry the unit open. We can reach no other conclusion based on the picture that you have sent. Once again, our apologies that this is not covered. We can offer you a replacement for a fee of $150. We do appreciate your business, and apologize for not being able to offer anything further.\n John L. Collins on 6/28/2012 12:58 PM\nPlease tell me your definition of accidental damage. My definition is that some type of accident has to occur. The tablet has not been mishandled, dropped, thrown, kicked, or any other kind of action that would damage it. There are no scratches, scrapes, chips, or any other damage marks on yje tablet. No games are played on it. It is kept next to my bed where only my wife uses for reading and Facebook. I will not spend $150.00 to repair this when it should be covered by your warrenty. If you will not stand by your workmanship then the only accident on my part is trusting your products and your company. Please decide if you want to keep me as a valued customer and honor you warranty or that you are happy with taking my money this time and the review I will write on Amazon about this product amd your company.\n\nLePan Support on 6/28/2012 10:30 AM\nHello Customer,\nunfortunately the kind of damage that you've described is not covered under our one year limited warranty, which does not extend to accidental damage. We offer only a manufacture warranty good for 1 year from the date of purchase (this cannot be extended or enhanced in any way).\nThis damage that has occurred to the tablet can be fixed for the fee of $150 USD, plus the shipping costs. If you would like to pay this fee to have your tablet replaced we can process an RMA for you. Please let me know how you would like to proceed from here and if you have any questions.\nThank you\nLePan Support on 6/27/2012 4:18 PM\nJohn,\nBecause we are unable to determine whether or not this is manufacturing error or user error, we are forwarding your case to the corporate office. They will let us know how to proceed. Our apologies for the delay.\n John L. Collins on 6/25/2012 6:44 PM\nHello. Myname is John Collins. I bought the LePan tc970 back on February 8, 2012. Everything was fine (except that it charged very slow) until it started falling apart. There is a bulge at the bottom seam and it will not close back. That caused the screen to start coming up on the bottom left. Now it won't even turn on. Please help with this problem.\n  _______________________________________________________________________________\nPlease everyone be very careful when buying this tablet or any other  Le Pan product because you will be going through the same problem  I just went  through.  Please read all the reviews on Amazon or were ever  you can find one.  I pray that you don't end up with a 200 dollar paperweight like I just did."}

I did some research and found the Le Pan TC970. I wanted a least a 9 inch screen or I felt it would be too difficult to see. This tablet was highly rated and very reasonably priced. I've had it now for about 2 months and it works great. It froze once and I hit the reset button and it responded right away. I've never had a problem since. It's a great product for the price."}

Its solid like a brick minus the weight. If you used to android then getting used to this is very simple. It has a terrific screen, interface, speakers and feel. I heard that lots of people had problems with the wifi on the previous update but with the v118 update I heard it went away. I don't know if this one came with it or not but I've been on wifi 24/7 and haven't had any problems yet. Another complaint I read about was the buttons on top. Volume is kinda hard to find but once you get the hang of it there's no problem. The power/ lock button is perfectly placed on the top right corner.(held landscape) I am very confident about this because I had 3 and a half months to make sure this was the one. As this is the most expensive thing I've ever bought. Hope you like your, that this helped and I apologize for grammar and spelling."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "Pros:\n-CHEAP!\n-Dual core power!\n-Snappy, speedy interface!\n-Netflix, Amazon Prime, Skifta (DLNA) streaming, NO PROBLEM!\n-Wireless reception good\n-Bluetooth connection pretty good\n-Currently lowest price tablet this size with access to Android app store\n-Nice look, solid build quality\n-MicroSD expansion slot\n-Good audio quality from stereo speakers\n\nCons:\n-Bluetooth stack a little quirky, but stable once connected\n-HDMI out requires purchase of an attachment\n-Internal storage 8gb - not a real constraint for me. lots of apps installed.\n-No USB\n-Battery life good, but average\n-not as many accessories made for it, Touchpad and iPad 1 cases fit. Bluetooth devices work\n-not as thin as iPad 3 or Asus Transformer prime, but still quite mobile and doesn't tire arms\n-not quad core, but more than adequate\n\nBegan researching tablets when the Kindle came out and set the new low for price points. Decided I preferred the 10inch form factor.  Wasn't really sure where a tablet fit in my gadget lifestyle, but felt like there was a need for something more mobile and travel friendly. Didn't want to spend a lot because I know I will want a lightweight laptop for more intense tasks.\n\nEvaluated and dismissed Xoom and Galaxy.  Really, really like the Asus 300t and the Prime. Just didn't want to invest that much.  Started searching the sub 300 price point and the Le Pan came up with solid reviews on Amazon.  Originally had the 970 briefly but returned because the single core just couldn't handle the streaming media job that was one of my key uses.\n\nThe Le Pan II fits the bill perfectly for me.  It's very affordable, especially given the power it has.  The dual core on this device makes it quite snappy. The touch screen is extremely responsive. It has been my constant companion for days.  It is very very usable for note taking with Evernote and a Logitech Bluetooth KB, it does Amazon Prime and Netflix without any jerkiness or blocky video.  Basically, it has more than enough processing power to meet my needs. Wireless performs as well as any laptop or iPad in my house.  The speed of the GUI is as fast or faster than the iPad 1. I don't have an iPad 2 or 3 to compare to.\n\nThe device is HoneyComb out of the box. Rumors of ICS abound and Le Pan has promised the update, but it hasn't surfaced as yet. Not a deal breaker for me, as the Honeycomb interface is quite usable and tablet oriented apps are emerging, so it's not just big goofy phone resolution.\n\nOne thing I would like to see fixed on it with ICS is the Bluetooth stack.  It could be just the Logitech KB I am using, but I have a connection issue.  Basically, I have to completely reboot the tablet to get it to connect.  When the device times out to save power or I turn the screen off, I can re-connect, but it won't stay connected. I don't have to re-pair, but I have to reboot.  It seems as though the KB is waiting for a response that the tablet only gives the first time they connect after a reboot.  Could be the KB too for that matter. At any rate, works just fine as long as I reboot.  As long as I keep using it periodically, as I do when I take notes at work throughout the day.  It works fine.\n\nBattery power is good, not great.  It will last around 8-9 hours using Bluetooth and wireless, but just barely.  It's a good idea to keep your very lightweight Le Pan plug handy.  Yes, it's a 30 pin proprietary job, but it works fine and they do have an HDMI out attachment you can buy.  I don't have much interest in that though.\n\nNote about the 9.7 inch form factor.  I have liked the 9.7 size since the iPad. It feels a touch more comfortable to me than the 10.1.  Be advised that widescreen video tends to look better on the 10.1 or even on an iPad since video is often formatted to that device.  That said, I have NO issue watching movies on my Le Pan.  I don't mind letterbox look, MX Player let's me play with how much I fill the screen. Most streaming video uses the screen real estate well, and finally I can format any mobile video to fit the screen perfectly as I see fit. Generally I just format for iPad using Handbrake and it looks great.\n\nI use a Logitech Bluetooth KB for Android devices with this tablet. I use the Blurex Leather Folio case made for the Le Pan I and II. I like both.\n\nBottom Line:  Very powerful tablet for a very low price. While I haven't had it long, I think the build quality is excellent and will hold up. If things break down, I will definitely update my review.  I have recommended to several friends. I love this tablet!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "After getting more information about the LePan 2 Tablet,  I decided that I will give it only a 3 stars review.  Unfortunately,  I had to return the Tablet.  Here is why:  The LePan  2 Tablet, would work fine at my workplace but fail to perform at home.  While at work, I could download all kinds of videos from various sources like ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC.  At home,  the videos would not download for more than 2 or 3 minutes before stopping.  I even called AT&T and had my internet speed upend to 6 mbps.  But alas, it did not work.  However, it would play YOUTUBE and NETFLIX just fine.  I have 3 laptops at home feeding from the same old router and they all work fine even with a lower mbps.  But the LePan 2 was being very selective at home on which videos would allow me to play.  Strange, because at work it really worked fine.  I was told that at work the Tablet works fine because we are super wired here at my workplace while at home, the LePan 2 Tablet might have some kind of bug in the Honeycomb system that makes it act like that.  Well,  for the price of this limited experience  I can buy  a laptop that will allow me to vision and play just about anything I throw at it.  Too bad, because the Tablet was kind of nice.  If you are happy just to use it as a great E-Reader, or casual video watching on YOUTUBE or NETFLIX, go for it.  It is great.  But if you are like me and want to enjoy the whole spectrum of videos available on the media system out there, then I would think twice before making the purchase.  I hope this has helped you to make up your mind about this very nice but limited Android Tablet.  LAST UPDATE AUG.15, 2012.  I have returned the LePan II Tablet and Purchased the Lepan older model TC970.  It is now on sale for $130 LESS than the Lepan II and works just as good as the most expensive version.  One thing I cannot do with the older model vs the LePan II, is that the older Lepan does not play the Smithsonian Channel .......Other than that, it is not worth the extra $130.  I am very, very happy with the former model of the LePan Tablet."}

Got another Lepan.  This time I thought I had it figured out.  I thought maybe it was all the applications running in the background that overloads the unit.  I got a couple of apps to take care of this and check running apps every so often.  I was wrong.  The unit froze again. The same ending.  Don't even try getting with their customer \"NO\" support.

Not dial-up slow, maybe an extra 30 seconds slower than my computer or my iPhone, but the embedded videos were slow and pixelated and not really worth watching. My brother has this same tablet and he mostly plays games on it, which works fine. The specific apps are pretty fast, but the browser is rather slow. And like I said, the poor video quality on embedded videos was a deal-breaker for me. The YouTube app displays videos great, but I don't want to have to click \"Watch on Youtube\" every time I want to watch a video. So I decided I'm switching to the iPad.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I purchased my tablet on April 1 (2 months of ownership).  The Le Pan II tablet is a good-to-excellent entry into the Android tablet market.  The size of the tablet makes it convenient to use a number of different covers/cases built for the Ipad.  The Le Pan tab itself has a very quality feel to it and it makes an impression.  Recently, I updated the firmware (see Press Releases on the company website) and the results were as advertised.  The process was straightforward and the update eliminated problems with dropped Internet connections when on the move.  Additionally, the company now sells it power cube via Amazon for those users who, like myself, need 2-3 additional plug-ins.  However, this where the my cautions come into play.\n\nFirst, the promised upgrade to Android Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0) remains just a promise (not a deal-breaker as 3.2 runs nicely).  Second, the promise of a proprietary cable for HDMI output remains just a promise (as you use the tablet this option becomes more desired).  Lastly, and unfortunately, this weekend my tablet died.  It is dead - no response at all to charging cable or the on/off switch.  I just sent an email to the support address to request an RMA #.  Of course I am disappointed but we all know electronic products can fail. So for now I will hope that the company will stand behind its 1-year warranty in a prompt and timely manner.  Timely action is important to me as the tablet has become an important and trusted part of my day-to-day life (email, communications, etc.).  I will update the review as the repair process unravels.\n\n18-June-2012 Update:  Thanks to the user community I have my Le Pan back to work (just needed a reset).  Also was alerted to the fact that the Le Pan Shopping site now has a number of accessories for sale including the cable for HDMI.  Even though I did not receive a response from Le Pan Service (RMA request), I still ratethe Le Pan II tablet a 4+ as the company now offers all items that were advertised at the time the Le Pan II was made available for sale.  The performance of the tablet, along with its appearance, make it a very attractive purchase."}

It comes equipped with Android 3.2 Honeycomb, and it is a joy to use.\nThe screen is responsive and clear, and I love typing on it.\nI would advice getting a case or something to prop it up a bit, it makes typing much more enjoyable.\nThe battery life is good, lasting anywhere from 5 to 8 hours of continual use, maybe more if wifi is turned off.\nIt has 8GB of memory built in, with up to 32GB via a micro SD card.\n\nThis is more than fast enough for my needs, which are internet browsing, streaming movies, Youtube, some online shopping, etc...\nI am not a real techy person, and probably don't use 90% of what this tablet can do, but for me it is perfect.\n\nNow, for some of the negative reviews you may have heard.  Yes, the company that makes this tablet is rather shady in my opinion.  They don't seem to follow through with their promises, however there is some light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nI was able to join a very useful forum at [...]\nThere are some great people over there who are dedicated to making the most out of this tablet, and it's predecessor, the TC970.\nAs of today, the company has not released Android 4.0 ICS for this device, like they said they would.  They have also not released any of the information necessary for private developers to do what they do to make custom versions of ICS for this device.  However, through that forum that I mentioned, there seems to be some headway being made, it is starting to look like the company is going to be releasing ICS any day now.\nIn my opinion, ICS is not that much of an improvement over Honeycomb, but the point is that the company made it seem like this device would be easily up-gradable to ICS, and it is easily up-gradable, but they have to release the OS for us to upgrade to.\n\nThere also seem to be some issues with people not having HDMI output available, and a lack of accessories for this device, but all in all, I have not been bothered by those things.\n\nThere are some people who have wifi issues with this device, I am not one of them.  My device has worked flawlessly everywhere I have tried to get a wifi signal.\n\nThere are some issues with this device and the Youtube app buffering constantly.  This was taken care of for me by updating the flashplayer, and by getting a wireless-n router.  This device seems to like that router better, it was a cheap $30 router that I got.  I will say that it makes sense for the youtube app to need a lot of bandwith to function properly.  The resolution for HD videos on this device rivals my desktop screen.\n\nThis review is for those people who are simply looking for a tablet to use to browse the internet, watch some movies, and play some games.\nThe Google Play market is awesome, tons of free apps, and some really great paid ones as well.  If you are an uber geek/techy person, this product will probably not be for you.  I can easily see someone like that getting frustrated that they can't have the latest and greatest OS right away.  For me, Honeycomb is polished and clean, and a joy to use.  So if ICS never comes out for this tablet it's not a big deal to me.\nI do think the people at the forum will eventually be able to get all the information they need to start making customer software for this device to help it perform even better, but even right out of the box it is great."}

My Lepan 2 was delivered in about 4 days so no issues with waiting. The tablet came with V118 version firmware already installed. I have had no problems with wifi connections and have tried at about 5 different locations with various types of routers. All apps I have installed seem to work fine. I did have to reinstall Skype once because the video did not work first time around.\n\nI added a 32 gb sd card (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G60AD6/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00) which works out fine for adding movies, music and pictures. The LePan 2 does not allow apps to be loaded on the extra sd card however, or maybe I just have not figured out how to do this yet.\n\nI bought the Targus case (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BZNE1Q/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00) which works great, but is a little thick and heavy. I use it around the house, but when traveling I use a very simple neoprene Ipad sleeve I got on Ebay for 4 bucks.\n\nAs a screen protector I use this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D8GAA0/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00. It comes with three protectors that do need some trimming. The protector does apply very easily without bubbles as long as you clean the screen very well with the cleaning cloth that comes with the Lepan. The protector is quite thick but I have not noticed any delays on the touch screen after adding this.\n\nAll in all I have thoroughly enjoyed the LePan 2 tablet so far to browse the internet, watch movies and TV shows online, stream Netflix, Pandora and play some games I found on the Google Marketplace. If you are in doubt, give it a chance. It's a great tablet for the price.\n\nUpdate July 5, 2012:\nI just returned from a two and a half week vacation in Germany and France with the Le Pan 2. The LP2 worked on all wifi routers I tried with no problems. I was able to keep up on emails, FB, etc without a problem. I'm still very glad I bought it!"}

The price can't be beat. I have had no issues at all (except my Win XP computer won't load drivers, luckily I have a Win 7 that does). I have loaded books, games and apps without a hitch. No problem connecting to the internet via wi-fi (at home and in motels).\nThe included start-up guide is very sketchy, what it doesn't say (and should), before you start using it, plug it in and let it charge overnight. That information is in the guide that is loaded on the tablet and is probably the cause of most of the problems reported in the reviews.\nPS don't be put off by the \"3-4 months to deliver\" estimate, the wait was only 3 weeks for me."}

It appeared it had some issues with the usb port, due to this weird apple-style connector...\n\nUPDATE: after two months it stopped working, time to try out their customer service...\n\nI owned Le Pan I and I liked it, except for the frequent freezes that made it impossible to live with it, at least without a paper clip for the reset button.\n\nLe Pan II also features this reset button and it made me wonder if it would freeze as often. But to my surprise it wouldn't. Just one time WiFi got into some weird state and required to reboot the device to make it work.\n\nBattery life seems to be a little shorter than that one of its predecessor but it is still very good. Probably that's because of a more powerful processor, but it didn't seem to work a lot faster to me.\n\nSo basically I had to pay extra $80 to get rid of freezes but I'm ok with it.\n\nIt lacks HDMI output and it is not visible as an external drive when you connect it to your computer unlike Le Pan I - with this one you need to install drivers to copy files to it. But that's still MUCH easier than having to deal with copying files to iPad :)"}

Before today, I actually liked it better than the iPad but now I don't recommend buying and getting your hopes up. Also, some things to keep in mind when buying it, you can't video chat on it. I downloaded Skype and tried video calling my brother's iPod touch via Skype but you can only call them like you would on a cell phone and even then the mic sucks. The camera also isn't very good. The only solution I can think of to getting my LePan tablet to work again is pushing the tiny reset button on the back and restoring it to the original settings but even then I might run into this problem again and I would rather just send it back than dealing with the hassle of resetting it all the time. So sad and disappointed :("}

Tried it for another week thinking it was app that was installed that didn't agree with the tablet. No dice. It wouldn't turn on using the power on button, only if you reset it. Sent it back to amazon and asked for a replacement. The estimated ship date was 8 weeks out, they were on back order. Surprisingly enough we got a new one in about 4 weeks. Well, it took 2 weeks for the issue to recur. At first, the tablet wouldn't turn on unless it was plugged in. We thought the battery was draining too quick. So we kept it turned off and fully charged when not in use. Well after a week of that, not even plugging it in would get it to turn on, only a reset. Now not even the reset will get it to turn on. I'm returning it for a refund."}

I loved the screen size and form, and being new to tablets it did nearly everything I wanted it to do, so I was happy.  It was a lot of fun and I would have given it 5+ stars at the time...\n\nBut it's been six months now, and this Le Pan TC970 tablet has gotten progressively slower and more frustrating.  First, it began slowing down a lot, then it started freezing frequently in the past few weeks, and finally it quit altogether last night.  Now it won't even turn on at all.  In this short evolution it has gone from a thing that I loved to a thing that I now hate.  I'm not even considering contacting the manufacturer because it's long out of warranty by now, and I don't want to compound my frustration by trying to deal with a non-responsive vendor's non-existent Customer Service--another frequent complaint about this tablet.\n\nI'm glad I held off on reviewing it when it was new so I wouldn't have to retract everything later.  Unfortunately, a  few months ago I recommended it to my father, who had ruined his third computer by always shutting it off before the anti-virus program could update and finish running and removing viruses (he wanted to \"save money\" on electric bills).  So now I've got him playing \"Tablet Roulette\" with this unreliable Le Pan TC970, too.  I can no longer feel guiltless recommending this tablet to anyone.\n\nAlso, what I feel is a generic problem with the Android operating system is the whole philosophy of open source application development--nearly all the available apps continually launch themselves, hogging memory and other resources (and probably spying on your activity) which requires another app (a Task Killer) to free up the tablet so it can continue to run relatively smoothly.  I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to hear any day now that the Android operating system is a growing favorite target for hackers to develop viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, etc. to harass the unsuspecting public for \"fun.\"\n\nI'm almost tempted to fork out the money for the IPad just to get away from this situation, but I'll need to do more research to see if they don't also experience some of the same problems..."}

It has google android 2.2, which means that I can not use it access audio books via overdrive service which requires version 2.4.  I do not believe I can upgrade the android version.  It has a sharp picture, adjustable spacing and type size and type.  It connects effortlessly to the wifi.  It has not frozen though I have had it operational on battery for 4-5 hours at a time.  It has other applications which I do not use as much as the reader as it is a tablet computer and not meant as an e-reader.  At a cost of $199 it provides considerably more than than similarly priced Amazon or Barnes and Nobel readers.  Its larger screen 9.7 inches creates the illusion of reading a paper book and it is comfortable to hold.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "Upon activating the tablet after it's been in standby mode for a while, the touchscreen becomes essentially non-functional for several minutes.  For example, after activating from standby and reaching the unlock screen with a pattern, I tried numerous times trying to swipe the correct pattern.  However, for some reason, the touchscreen would never \"maintain\" the line I tried drawing while swiping over the circles.  The line would always \"breakup\" before I could finish the pattern for 4 circles.  It seemed to be skipping from one circle to the next without any continuous connection.  This happened for about 5 minutes, until it finally read my finger swipe correctly and unlocked.  Frustrated, I decided to try a password lock instead of a pattern.  So I put the tablet on standby for a while, reactivated it, and tried putting in my password via the keyboard.  However, whenever I pressed a key, it would read it as double, sometimes even triple (e.g. pressing the 'd' key once, would result in 'dd' or 'ddd' being entered into the password field).  This happened with all the other keys I pressed, and continued for several minutes, until it stopped doing it all of a sudden and was finally able to put in my password.  Frustrated again, I turned off any lock.\n\nHowever, not being able to control the unlock screen with finger swipes wasn't the only issue after returning from standby.  Whenever I tried to use pdfs after returning from a long standby, I could not control scrolling or zooming.  Anytime I tried scrolling, it would zoom in and out.  This would continue for several minutes until it would finally function normally.\nSo it's pretty clear that with my tablet, something happens to the touchscreen functionality after it's been in standby for a while.  I always had to wait several minutes after activating from standby for the touchscreen to work properly.  The touchscreen keyboard must be \"reloading\" during that time, or something.  But yea, this is unacceptable for me.  I tried doing a factory reset as well as downloading the new firmware, but it still kept giving me the same problem.  I really wanted to enjoy this tablet since everything else works decently, but this one major flaw with the touchscreen has led me to return this tablet.\n\nI've been anti-Apple for the longest time, but after trying out the ipad 3 and its retina display, I think I may take the plunge and get it.  I had narrowed my tablet choices to only 4:3 format because my main uses are reading pdfs, textbooks, and magazines, and it looks like the ipad is the only other option out there.  Also, that retina display makes pdfs look amazing, especially small font on documents.  I had considered the Coby Kyros Android 4.0 with the 9.7 inch screen, but the negative reviews turned me off to it.\n\nIt's possible that it was just my Le Pan 2 touchscreen that was defective, so hopefully you future purchasers of this tablet don't run into the same problem."}

I happened to stumble accross this one here on Amazon. I read the reviews, watched many videos on YouTube and decided to take the plunge and order it. I thought why not give it a try? Amazon has great return policies.\n I considered the fact that it was a tablet, and a brand name I had never heard of, so I bought the extended warranty for it as well. I am a Tech, so I figured I could fix it if it broke, but the $60 price of the warranty was a no brainer.\n  I am very pleased with the overall quality of it so far. It's fast, the screen is great, and it's internal memory is expandible up to 32gb. The build quality is solid and I like the aluminum back. The only thing I found was a little flimsy was the power cord end where it plugs in to the Le Pan. It felt like the plastic end was a little thin and hollow feeling.\n It picks up my wi-fi signal very well. There is no lag when watching You Tube or Netflix.\n\nThe only real downfall I see as of right now is the lack of accessories. Maybe that will change as this gains market share, but don't expect to go to your local retailer and pick up a case or extra charger and cable. I did buy a case for it here on Amazon that was custom made for the Le Pan 1 and 2 and it fits great!\n\nIt's hard to find a used iPad at this price, and this tablet is every bit as good as an iPad 2 at more than half the cost.\n Go ahead and order it. You can return it if you don't like it, but I bet you end up being very happy with it.\n\nUPDATED: I had it for 9 days and loved it, but it wouldn't turn on today. Had it plugged in to the charger all night. No Le Pan logo, nothing...It was a really nice tablet for the 9 days it worked. I thought I would get something comparable to Apple, and it was,but It should last for more than 9 days.\nI'm going to buy an iPad."}

I am a Mom with a passion for quilting and sewing who just wanted a tablet for a great price. I don't give a flip about having to have the latest Apple product and I own an Android phone. So, the direction for me was simple. I did a lot of research though because I am on a budget. I kept seeing the same name pop up in many reveiws for the Le Pan II so I researched it at length. It seemed to have all the features I needed and many I have no idea what to do with. I have had my Le Pan II for three weeks so here's what I know:\n\n1. The battery life is great lasting for many hours playing the free music from Google while I sew! I simply search for music I enjoy, download, and play! So very easy! But, I did follow directions and charge the tablet for 8 hours before using the first time.\n\n2. The on/off button is easy to use if you follow the directions of holding it down for a few seconds when it has been turned off. Hold it down a short second if it's just sleeping.\n\n3. Connecting to Wifi was a breeze and seamless...I just followed the prompts.\n\n4. It has amazing map accuracy but unlike my phone it has to be connected Wifi to get the Google Maps.\n\n5. I have no idea what light spillage or dead pixels are but I don't think I have any. It has never locked up and plays videos with out pausing.\n\n6. The sound is very clear and loud even nested inside the Targus Case.\n\n7. I find the serial plug into the tablet works just fine and because it has USB charging/wall plug I can plug it into my lap top to transfer documents and pdf sewing files.\n\n8. I could have bought it from Best Buy but the price was better on Amazon.\n\n9.

Happy with the battery life - I've played around with it all day without running it completely out.  No problems with wifi connection.\nThe only con I have (mentioned by other reviewers) is the volume button, which isn't quickly accessible, but that's just nitpicking.\nI love this tablet, love the price, happy I bought it!"}

My excitement soon turned to frustration when I couldn't get it to connect with the Verizon network using my 4G Mobile router. It would connect to public hot spots. My desktop, laptop and Nook connect but the Le Pan would not. Le Pan's Support was not any help. They gave me a one sentence answer to my email. I took the tablet to the Verizon store along with my mobile router to see if they could get it to work but no one could. Consequently, I had to return the Le Pan  and ordered a iPad.\n\nThe Le Pan is a really nice tablet at a good price, but it's not much good if can't connect."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I researched this tablet and suggested \"we\" buy this tablet for my niece's children for Christmas. We all pitched in and made it a nice Santa gift.  She bought two and liked them for a time.  In January, I purchased one myself and like it very much.  The problem is that this item freezes quite regularly and I don't know why, which means constant resetting.  My nephew's tablet had to be returned to LePan for service last month, after 3 months of use. A month later, it is still not back from the manufacturer.  Calling this company is very hard to get through to -- actually almost impossible.  The times that we did get through we were told they were totally backed up.  I'm not sure I like the sounds of that.  We now have a total of 3 of these units in our family and we did purchase the Square Trade warranty, but they only kick in after the LePan warranty expires.  For the money, I still like my unit, but am unhappy with the repair service my nephew received, and since I am the one who  did the research and suggested this, I feel badly about it.  He is a 12-year-old boy who really missed his tablet for a month.  My review would have been higher had I not had this experience with inability to contact the company after needing service shortly after purchase. I think most of us know that customer service can make or break a company no matter how good a product is.  More accessability to this company would have helped my rating immensely. Thanks.\nSeptember 3,  2012\nI really hate to give bad reviews to any company trying to make competitive products in this market.  However,  this is probably one of the worst purchases i have made.  As noted,  we have 3 in the family and they have all been sent back once and need to go back again at the cost of $15 in postage everytime. If there were a class action suit against these tablets I would join it.  I can not even turn the tablet on unless I stick a pin in the reset hole so now iI keep a safety pin with my case! I find this as good as throwing $230 into the garbage disposal."}

I check my emails, surf the internet, and have downloaded games and other apps. I wasn't crazy about the volume rocker and downloaded volume in notification from the Play Store. Works great.....no more fiddling with the volume rocker! I have found a couple of games that downloaded fine but didn't load....Temple Run was one of them. Bummer! Not sure if it's the tablet or the app. I also have transferred movies and music from my notebook to the tablet and they play fine. You may have to check around the Play Store for the best video players to play your movies .........some will play one format smoothly but not the other. I have a 32gb micro sd card for storage which really makes enjoying the tablet nice.\n\nFor the time I've have it, I have had to reset it twice. I never had a wi-fi problem but since the v118 update it sometimes disconnects after being in sleep mode a long time. At first I panicked but now neither of these two things turned out to be a big deal (so far) to me.  I just either re-connected to wi-fi or powered down and restarted. The only thing I'm waiting for now is the HDMI cable to be available and the HDMI option to re-appear back in settings.\n\nI know people are concerned about the upgrade to ICS. I'm not familiar with ICS so I don't know how much the upgrade will improve the performance of the LePan II.  For the time being Honeycomb has fulfilled most of my needs.\n\nCheck out the Le Pan Life Forum for a ton of info on the LePan. Overall, a nice tablet for the money!!"}

After using the tablet for about 2 weeks, it would no longer power on - totally unresponsive.  I contacted Amazon that I wanted to return it, but there is a problem - I needed to be able to wipe my sensitive info first.  I had several email accounts setup on the tablet and since I can't power it on I have no way of wiping it.  Their answer was - I should \"trust them\" that when they receive it they will wipe it for me.  I have never heard of anything more ridiculous!  I spoke to a manager and he was no more helpful.  I suggested that I open the device and I remove the hard drive (this way I know my data is safe) however they did not accept my suggestion.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "As of writing, this tablet now supports CyanogenMod7, which is Android 2.3. (Gingerbread). By contrast, the stock ROM comes with Android 2.2 (Froyo), which is still acceptable but obviously suboptimal for a tablet that can run something better. A brief Google search will get you started. I was able to switch everything over in about an hour.\n\nSecond, the battery life for this thing is amazing. I charge it so infrequently that I'm often taken aback by how much power it's not using in between charges. I can't even remember the last time I had to plug it in, though I tend to charge it up anyway just in case the zombie apocalypse happens while I'm at work and I need to locate safe houses on my way to the capitol or something. Anyway, if you're looking for a tablet that can do better than \"maybe 6 hours on a single charge if you're lucky\", this is the way to go.\n\nOther pros include surprisingly powerful speakers, good Wi-fi reception even with a low signal, an acceptable screen for the price, and so on. Although I wouldn't say it's designed specifically to be ergonomic, it's still comfortable to hold. Pretend it's a Dualshock for maximum grip comfort.\n\nNot much to say when it comes to negatives. Since it's not Honeycomb, actual made-for-tablet-app support is somewhat spotty. About half of my apps notice it's a tablet anyway. The other half just run in regular mode. I've yet to have this be a big issue, but I do wish I could use all the new tablet apps out there. Other than that, the glossy screen smudges easily, which is what you signed up for when you get a tablet in general I suppose. Customer service is limited from what I hear, although it's not like Android is really complicated enough to warrant its necessity. Overall, no dealbreakers, but some downsides.\n\nNote to those who bought this, I've found&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Acase-Premium-Leather-Slimline-Carrying-Case-for-Apple-iPad-and-HP-TouchPad-Black/dp/B003P7VU40/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Acase Premium Leather Slimline Carrying Case for Apple iPad and HP TouchPad (Black)</a>&nbsp;to be the best choice for a case.

I also have an iPhone 4S so an iPad would have been a more compatible choice, but I wanted to try out the Android world and at this price it was relatively easy to do so.  I've been able to connect with every wifi hotspot I've tried so far (work, home, Starbucks, etc.) but frequently had to restart the machine to restore wifi connectivity after moving to a new location or after leaving the tablet idle for a time.  The new firmware upgrade (available at the Le Pan website) seems to have fixed that issue for me, so I can move seamlessly from one hotspot to another without having to restart.  The wireless signal strength also seems to be improved.  I've added a 32 gb microSD card and the Elsse Premium case (requires some mods to expose the ports, but it's only $9).  All in all, a fine introductory tablet."}

I misplaced my cord for it and since it's a proprietary cord, you have to get it thru LePan.  I started my request by calling on 4/6 and kept getting a recorded message that told me all technicians were busy and to try my call again later...then a hang up.  This went on for a few days.  Finally on 4/12 I speak to a live person that was really not helpful at all and could have cared less either way.  I actually asked him if he thought that was an effiecient way to handle things and he said, \"I don't know, I guess not\".  Finally I write the request ticket on 4/12.  It is now 4/24 and it still hasn't been mailed.  I paid them on 4/17.  The last explaination I recieved was, \"Currently our shipping department is a little backed up. Your order was recently processed and sent to shipping where it awaits shipment. Your patience and cooperation are greatly appreciated.\"  REALLY????? Is there only 2 people in the entire company??????  Moral of the story, you can have a great product but if you don't have the customer service to back it, you won't have customers for long!

Over all a really great product. If people are having wifi problems their is a update that just got released today by Le pan. I just downloaded it and it is for the wifi fix and blue tooth. I got the update from a forum site just for Le pan tablet owners. Here is the web site [...]  They also have a 30 pin to HDMI cable coming in may or June. ICS will be released in may.

Bottom line is that if your tablet works, it's a nice entry level tablet for games, web browsing and email... and many android apps. But, I can't fully recommend it for the traveler or power user.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I considered getting a tablet for a while, but have never been someone who rushes into the \"latest fad\" in electronics.  Last December I saw my kids at Christmas and my DIL had an iPad2.  It was nice, but way too pricey for me, however I did like the features it offered and was looking for something similar without the proprietary connections Apple requires.  After much reading and learning, I stumbled upon the Le Pan II.  It seemed to have everything I wanted without the huge cash outlay required by some other manufacturers.\nI ordered mine March 9th and received it April 2nd.  I've waited to write a review to give myself time to familiarize myself with most of the things that can be done with this tablet.  So far I have used Gmail, Hotmail, YouTube, Twitter, Skype, Facebook, several games (Pirates Of The Caribbean - Master of the Seas, AirAttack, TV and Movie trivia games, etc), Flixster, Regal, Google World and at least two drawing apps plus numerous other miscellaneous apps which are available for free.  I've downloaded apps from getjar, Google Play and the Amazon Android market.  I've changed the wallpaper, created, configured and changed my notification ringtone from a MP3 file.  I've listened to music, radio and police/fire scanners and used the GPS module.  I've formatted and installed two different 32gb microSD cards with no problems and transferred data (music and photos) again with no problems.\nIn other words I think I have tried and tested just about every thing this tablet has to offer.  All with few to no problems (had one small problem with a Hotmail app, but I changed it to an older version and have had no other problems except my lack of tablet experience).  I've connected to 3 different wifi routers (home and two more on the go).\nI also contacted the Le Pan support site.  Emailed them from their website over a weekend (on a Sunday), received a reply Monday morning.  Request was filled within two days (I ordered an extra USB cable and charger plug).  I received them today (April 17) and they even sent me an extra wrist strap at no extra charge.  No issues with the tablet which required any further support.\nI got a CaseCrown black tablet case (currently unavailable) as well as a soft-sided sleeve from Disney and the Armorsuit screen protector<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ArmorSuit-MilitaryShield-Le-Pan-II-Screen-Protector-Shield-with-Lifetime-Replacements/dp/B007HIQBPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ArmorSuit MilitaryShield - Le Pan II Screen Protector Shield with Lifetime Replacements</a>. It protects the screen from scratches and minimizes the fingerprints as well as making it easier to wipe them off when they do occur.\nTablet feels solid, well-built, sturdy and between many of the reviews and posts here, as well as YouTube, and the Lepanlife forum, plus a friend I made via the review comments if I had a question I found the answer in short order.  A huge thank you to all those who took the time to write lengthy reviews about this tablet and post videos.\nMy tablet came with Baseband v. 118 which appears to have solved most of the problems people had in the past.  The only thing I haven't tried yet is Bluetooth because I do not have any Bluetooth accessories to test.  Frankly, the keyboard (while it does take a little getting used to) is adequate for typing.  No, I cannot type as fast on it as I would a full size keyboard, but it's good enough for now.  At some point I may get one with Bluetooth, but for now I couldn't be happier.  I got everything I wanted for almost half the cost of a similarly configured tablet and mine has (basically) unlimited storage capabilities via the 32gb microSD cards.  If I need more storage, I just buy another card."}

I was very happy with it except for the fact that it froze at least 5 to 6 times a day.  I did a little bit of research and saw that it could be becasue it needed the update.  So I did do the most current update that was located on lepantab.com and it did not resolve the issue.  I then let them know about the issue and they said that I would need to send in the tablet so they could fix it. I had to pay for the shipping because according to them ''shipping to us is the responsibility of the customer'' even though they sold me a faulty product.  I sent it to them and they received it over a month ago and to this day I have still yet to recieve it.  The following is my experience with them so far.\n\nChad LeDoux on 2/29/2012 3:37 PM\nAt first it would freeze up every once in awhile. But now it is freezing ALL THE TIME. At least 5 times a day.

I am just making sure that it was actually sent out by the end of last week like you said it would be. Thank you.\n\nChad LeDoux on 4/16/2012 1:38 PM\nI would like a response today as of when I am going get my tablet fixed and returned. This is becoming extremly unprofessional. Thank you\n\nSorry for all of the reading but I just wanted to get all of that in there.  Anyways as of today I still have yet to hear anything back and am still waiting.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I've had this tablet for over six months after returning several others to the store.  It is a great value for the price- runs most apps, surfing the web is a breeze, and I love the kindle app.  I download content from the library no problem, and I've used it to record audio/video with little struggle.  This tablet has been dropped on the pavement, thrown across the room by my two year old, and used frequently by my five-year old.  It remains intact and works like a charm.  It has been intuitive since the beginning- very easy to use.  It didn't really come with a user manual (there's a pdf on the device) but I never needed it anyway.\n\nAs others have said, fingerprints are an issue, but the sturdiness is worth the extra effort.  Beware, however, that the latest android version is ice cream sandwich, and to my knowledge there isn't an upgrade for this device, so some of the newest apps may not work.  Also, I had  some trouble getting the FirstIssue magazine app to download.\n\nThis tablet will do the majority of tasks the average person wants- internet, ereader, apps, games, video/youtube, pictures- most of my friends think I forked out the money for ipad, but I really spent less than $200!  I've been extremely pleased.  I would definitely purchase another device from this maker.  Check out the youtube reviews- they are great!"}

I would highly recommend."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "UPDATE: After doing the free upgrade to Android ICS (which was relatively easy) I am happy to report that I no longer have wifi issues - it connects fine everywhere.  Also, after checking the \"allow plugins\" option in FireFox Beta, I no longer have Flash problems either.  Changing the rating to 5*s now.  Hopefully, Le Pan gets more recognition so that there are more accessories out there altho LePanTab.com's store has gotten better.\n\nFor the price, this tablet cannot be beat.  There are a lot of cheaper tablets out there but this has solid build quality (love the metal accents), sharp responsive screen (not sure if it is Gorilla Glass I have read that it is & some say it isn't), long battery life (over 8 hours) & has all the little extras built in like GPS.\n\nIt comes with 1 30 pin cord & so far you can only order another thru the company itself.  Altho if you shave down the plastic parts on an Apple cord, it works.\n\nThe downside of the tablet is that it takes a long time to charge (altho the long battery life negates that).  The buttons are rather small & hard to press on the curved surface but that is to be expected when you want this thing to be thin & light.  The speakers are on the back which can be muffled if laying down or in a case.  It has rebooted itself on me occasionally but the boot time is fairly quick so not that annoying (yet).\n\nFlash works just fine when I use the YouTube app but if a video is embedded in a website, it does not work - tried in both the default browser & FireFox.\n\nThe biggest complaint is the wifi does not always work - altho I suspect it has more to do with the hotspot than the tablet itself (or at least the compatibility of the 2).  In most places, it connects immediately with no problems but when I am at work/school it will not pick up a signal or it will take hours before it does (altho my phone & laptop find it).  If it did this everywhere I would claim it defective but it is only in the same wifi areas so who knows ...\n\nThis is my 1st Android product so not much to say there but I so far prefer Symbian as it communicates more with you - like letting you see what apps are running & stopping them w/out having to download an app.  Speaking of apps, there are soooo many in the Play Market that it can be overwhelming to pick which one to use.\n\nGot the Targus Truss case for the HP TouchPad which fits this perfectly.  Hopefully this brand will become more popular and we will start to see dedicated accessories that fit it without adding bulk/size.\n\nIn sum, if you are looking for the cheapest tablet that is decent, reliable & all the bells & whistles, this is the one for you."}

I received the replacement tablet on 8/07. I up-grade to platform to ICS on 08/08/12. Afterwards I noticed that the tablet would drop the Wi-Fi signal every 10 minutes or so. Honestly I did not play with it long enough before upgrading to ICS to noticed if the problem already existed. Informed Lepan, they sent me a checklist of items to check. None them fixed the issue. I am done. I am going to let my son play with it. Good luck if you make the purchase. Personally, I would get a refurbished Samsung for 299.00 if I could have a do over.\n\n***** Update 7/1/2012- DOS- it would not start-up today. wow...I am so disappointed!!! I should have listened to all of the negative reviews. Just found out that Amazon has a lot of vendors taking advantage of their rating systems. They actually give people incentives to give false (4 and 5 star) reviews on their products. Absolutely terrible!!! AMAZON PLEASE figure out away to stop those crooks. I rely heavily on Amazons rating system. It appears I have been hood winked :(\n\n****- Update 6/12/2012- A small glitch has developed with the battery charge indicator. It does not reflect the actual state of charge and constantly reads to be at 50%. I have also noticed that when the battery is low the stability of the tablet began to flicker and freeze.\nThere is an update (firmware?) for the tablet posted at the website. I am going to back up my files onto my micro Sd card and install the update. I will let you know how it works.\nI still think this tablet is the best bang for the bucks, and would rate it a 4.5. It really serves me well. I love looking a Netflix on it, reading books (purchased a 7.00 anti-glare screen), and video chatting with the kids.\n\n****** Just what I needed. I purchased my tablet on Feb 3rd and received it around the 10th. I decided to wait a little while before making any comment to see if the tablet might produce some glitches after regular use. So far there have been no glitches noticed.\n\nI originally owned the Samsung 7 inch G-tab. The Samsung had all the bells a whistles but the reduced screen size was a major disadvantage for me because I wanted to use my tablet to read from during sermons and speeches. My first experience with the Android tablets revealed that the tablet functions were basically the same as my android cell phone. They basically will not do anymore than your phone is capable of doing (just a larger screen). The tablet really doesn't work well (for me) when trying to produce projects like papers, art, video editing, spread sheets, or Power Points. You can do some manipulations on projects, but nothing serious. The biggest advantage of the tablet for me is portability, screen size verses a phone, gaming, reading, videos, and making presentations. Armed with this knowledge I sat out to find the best tablet for the money.\n\nAfter hours of research (in my humble opinion) the La Pad tablet is by far the best for my wants. The picture quality is above reproach. The processing speed outstanding. The screen resolution... fantastic. The 4.3 screen layout is preferred over the 16.9 aspect ratio, unless you are looking at a movie. Basically, what I am trying to say is that this tablet will serve you just as well if not better than any other at twice the cost.\n\nLast words...I would advised you to educate your self before making any purchase. Write down the most important purposes for your purchase, determine if it can really do what you need it to do and to the extent needed, and then find the best product for your hard earned dollar."}

Even after trying to reset it etc and make sure it was fully charged , it still was stuck with a black screen . Nothing was done to it , and it was simply sitting there being charged when it happened.\n\nI could deal with this if I could get some satisfaction from the manufacturer . Have tried calling ( on hold 2 hrs then disconnected then 1 hr and disconnected ) and no response to several emails .\n\nIn all , good tablet while it lasted , but very poor (if any) customer support . Sadly ,if the company cannot honor it's warranty I will not be buying anything else from them in the future . Will also steer people clear of this one because of lack of support .\n\n..............................................................\n\nPrevious review:Ordered this tablet after spending several weeks comparing a bunch on Amazon.  Got mine the next day after ordering ( payed extra because it was the only day I was going to be around to receive it) .So far I have had only one issue,  and that was the Wi-Fi.  Simple fix was changing my router to WEP from WAP.

The wifi works great at my house running N wireless and encryption wpa2.......\n\nBut I do have trouble connecting at some other locations - I'd normally attribute that to the local site but I can connect with my smart phone every time.  Don't know what's going on with that.\n\nAlso not a big fan of the proprietary 30 pin to usb cable.  No HDMI output cable available yet - kinda stinks.\n\nOverall the tablet is fast with bright clear screen and streams netflix very smoothly.  Finger prints could bug some of you they don't really bother me and I rarely notice them - that is probably true of most tabs but no biggy for me.  I have read many complaints re netflix streaming and here is a word of caution.  If you have N wireless and add any G wireless item to the router the entire network will drop to G speed.  This is true of many of the smart TVs on the market.  dropping to G speeds could cause netflix to buffer excessively.  I only allow N wireless to connect with my network.\n\nIt does have the android market - I guess they call it Google Play now.  Pretty good deal for $275 with free ship and no sales tax.\n\nIt would be an easy 5 of 5 if the wifi was more dependable and the hdmi out cable was available.  Hope there will be an upgrade to ice cream sandwich - don't know."}

However, price is not all that matters with these things and it really depends on what you use it for and overall quality.\n\nI don't regret the purchase, but people who are used to consumer ready products and don't like to hack, figure things out, etc should stick with Galaxy or iPad.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Great price\n- Solid quality\n\nDisadvantage:\n- Lack of accessories. Even basic ones such as USB OTG or HDMI connector.\n- Touchscreen sometimes has trouble with pattern unlock (this may be more my product or my fingers though)\n- Lacks back camera (I didn't think this would be a problem, but it's something I would like to see). I knew this buying it though and it's negated with the price.\n\nGeneral:\n\nThis is very well built. I'm pleased with the way it feels and it works as I expected (if you have an android phone, it's basically a big giant phone). I had no problems installing Android Applications. Any disadvantages with the software are inherent with the software and not with the tablet.\n\nThe manufacturer's website is very sparse with information. If you want any significant information you have to search for it and find what others have to say about it.\n\nPerformance:\nI use it mostly for PDF reading. It's pretty slow for large files on any number of reading devices. However, it displays small files very well. I use it for double column journal articles and it's big enough (for me) to read it in \"fit screen mode.\" This is true of both Adobe Reader, Aldiko, and one other reader I forgot the name of and have since uninstalled.\n\nI installed an unofficial version of VLC player (noneon version) and it works great. No complaints there.\n\nSoftware:\n\nIt's pretty bare... but that's how I like it. Unlike my Samsung Epic 4G, it's not filled with bloatware and I can install many of them.\n\nThis is a big plus for me and I've installed all the applications I normally like without any bugs.\n\nApplications (known) that I use that work great: Google Voice, Skype, Kindle Reader, Aldiko, Facebook, Firefox, eBay, VLC, Tivo, Wikipedia.\n\nThe Adobe Reader does strange things when you change stretch/zoom in view settings. For me, if I change it while reading a PDF it escapes out and goes back to the main adobe file selection screen. This may be software though.\n\nNetworking:\n\nIt doesn't accept ad hoc connection (unless you root it). I found out this is common to most mobile devices not just Le Pan. The device doesn't seem to have a problem finding my network at home but it does seem to have a hard time finding new networks when I go to Starbucks, Barnes and Nobles, etc (or other restaurant with free Wifi). It's not a huge problem, but it takes a while to find new networks.\n\nBluetooth is slow... It's slower transferring files than my Samsung Epic 4G and a Treo. However, I don't do much with Bluetooth anyway and the mouse I installed works fine and was easy to install.\n\nAccessories:\n\nHorrible support. This is a relatively new product and it's not from one of the big manufacturers, but it misses some of the basic accessories that they should have made pre-launch. I can say this because I'm an electrical engineer and I've checked their the circuit diagram they submitted to FCC,... there should be no reason they shouldn't have had their HDMI adapter ready at launch.\n\nDoes not have a 30-pin connector to USB connector. I would have liked to see them come out\n\nAlso, regarding accessories, they are difficult to find. You have to send an e-mail to customer support and pay $10 shipping to receive a cable.\n\nTheir products aren't compatible with any other tablet device. Some iPod chargers work if you shave a piece of plastic off though.\n\nSummary:\n\nOverall, if you can do without the HDMI or connecting to external USB devices this is an excellent product. The company promises to bring these out, but many new companies break promises. With the Le Pan TC970, they said it would be upgradeable to Honeycomb and now they say it will not be available."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I received my TC 970 tablet about a week ago, very quick shipping, got it in 2 days. I have been playing with it for few days now and I have to say, for a price tag of $199, its an amazing tablet. Yes it only comes with Android 2.2 (Froyo), and they don't have any update available for Gingerbread, Honeycomb or ICS 4.0. But for just browsing, watching videos, playing games and using apps like Skype, Facebook and others, its a great tablet. Yes there are few games that cant be installed, because of the high requirements of the game, but I don't care, but if you do care then spend $80 more and get Le Pan II for $279. It has the QUALCOMM 1.2GHz Dual-core Snapdragon processor and more memory. But I have to say my expectation with TC 970 was very low until I got it, I was just amazed at the quality and performance of this tablet. With 1GHz single-core TI Arm Cortex 8 and 512MB memory it performs well. With that said don't try to compare this with iPad2, but it does 75% of what iPad2 can do, and for only $199 compared to $500 its an amazing deal. I do own an iPad2 also. Few small things, the internal built-in flash NAND storage is only 2GB, so buy a $20 32GB micro-sd card and stick it in. It comes with 2GB SD card already, but I think that's small if you want to store pics and movies on it. Yes the tablet does some time gets slow after you have too many applications running, so either kill the task in task manager or reboot. I have only had to do it once since I got it. The big plus this tablet has over other cheap ones is the Google Market app (now Google Play) which is already configured and this tablet is certified for it. You don't have to first root the device and install it like other cheap ones. But I still recommend rooting the device, opens up the tablet for a lot more stuff then whats on GooglePlay (not that its any less stuff there). So if you want a budget tablet that works great, this is a good candidate. I am still playing with the tablet, if I find anything else I will update."}

Since I've been using Android products for a while now, figured this was the way to go.  Delivery took about 6 weeks but I ordered in January during the big rush.  I've been using the Le Pan religiously for the last month and I'm completely sold.\n\nIt powered up straight out of the box and connected to my Wi-Fi right away.  From the beginning, I've had no issues connecting either at home or on the road.  In fact, connecting at hotels seems quicker and easier than with my laptop.  My last trip was sans computer and I managed just fine. I purchased the Targus Truss Case for the HP that was recommended by another reviewer and have been completely satisfied with it as well.\n\nMy only complaint so far was video.  I moved three movies to a memory card and only got sound on one of them.  Video playback was fine but sound stopped before the movie started.  This may be more the fault of my player (I'm cheap, I only download the free stuff) so I'm not marking down the Le Pan.\n\nOverall a great product so far but I've not had any dealings with customer support.  I honestly hope I don't have to."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I am gonna start this review but saying that this was my first ever tablet. I was looking to get a tablet under $300 because the new ipad was out of my budget and I did tons of research and based on other reviews,this was the best tablet in my price range. I was skeptical at first to buy le pan because I had never heard of them before but after using the tablet for couple of weeks now, I can assure you that this product is really well built. It feels very solid/sturdy and you wouldn't expect such a fine product for low price range. Based on the reviews, many people were having issue with wifi but personally, I have had absolutely no problem with that. I have played with my friends' Ipad before and this feels no different than that. Its just your preference between Droid and apple. I have been using driod phone about a year and I love Droid better than iPhone or another apple product. This has a big screen and it is perfect to watch movies or surf the browser. It has a fast processor which is perfect for playing games. The screen resolution far exceeded my expectation. If you are looking for a tablet under $300, look no further.

It would automatically kick itself off my WIFI, but when it worked it was very fast in downloading apps, and web pages.  My son loves Thomas the train, and there is only one Android Thomas app, (no fault of Le Pan) but when you go to the official Thomas website the puzzle game is not optimized for play, so my son gets frustrated with it, and i know it is the android market, because he is able to play those same puzzles on my computer with no problem.  To get to the meat of the matter, you cannot delete an app from the home screen, even after moving it to one of the extended screens, it still sits on the home screen. Well, I hate this thing now, because it stopped working completely this morning! no amount of trying to reset it will make it turn on, so imagine my explaining to my 3 year old, that his tablet is broken, and he will have to go back to his VTECH reader, he took it in good strides, luckily because is dad and I, always tell him these are just \"things\" they can be gone in a second!\n\nPlease double think before you purchase, if you want cheap go for this, just be prepared it may be broken and gone after one month!, he never dropped it, and i was right there with him this morning playing his ROARY game when it just went blank.  Of course my 30 days return is up so I cannot return it, and Le Pan's customer service will not be available before Monday.  If you need a tablet for yourself or child, just make a good choice, and proper investment, we paid $250 for it, and still thought it was reasonable, but I guess reasonable is not good enough!!  Will update again, when I call their customer service"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "This product is from an unknown company (at least, unknown to those who have not purchased this device), but I don't expect that to last.  This product is well worth the purchase, unless you have misgivings about the lack of peripherals/add ons.\n\nI would encourage you to read the postings at [...] before purchase.\n\nYou can find accessories that work on the market, but aren't advertised for the Le Pan II.  For example:\n\nLogitech Tablet Keyboard for Android 3.0+ (920-003390) works perfectly.\n\nTargus Truss Case/Stand for HP TouchPad - THZ07202US (Black/Gray) fits the Le Pan II perfectly.\n\nApple (iPhone/iPad) 30-pin cables work as USB cords, though you have to perform minor surgery to get them to dock with the device.  See [...]\n\nThat's really my only negative about this device -- the connector on the cable that ships with it is delicate and will not survive a moderate impact with torque (the plug comes apart).  I now use the cables for my iTouch to power both the Le Pan and the iTouch with the same cable, after performing the VERY minor surgery explained in the link above.\n\nThe only other major complaint you will hear is that it isn't compatible with Ice Cream Sandwich / Android 4 yet.  If this is a major consideration for you, you will probably want to look elsewhere or prepare to wait.\n\nIf you have concerns about who is the product vendor, the company name is Matsunichi and they are based in Hong Kong, China.

I had problems connecting to the internet even though I had a full strength connection to my router.  My Le Pan was the only device in the household that had these problems.  I even returned my first Le Pan II as I thought it might be a lemon but my 2nd Le Pan II had the same issue.  The only work around to getting the Wifi working was resetting the router each time I connected which became very cumbersome.\n\nI was just about to give up and return my Le Pan II again until I decided to try an older router.  Since other reviewers had no Wifi issues I suspected that the problem could be router related.  After switching from a Motorola SBG900 Wireless Surfboard Gateway (the one Comcast gives) to a Trendnet TEW-432BRP, all my issues went away.  My Le Pan II now works great and I will be keeping it.  I'm not sure why the Le Pan II works well with some routers and not others, but maybe someone can look into it.\n\nIt's a nice tablet however Le Pan really needs to provide more software support.  The Bluetooth needs an update and the software currently does not support the HDMI output.  Despite these issues it's a great tablet at a great price.  I could go on about all the things that the tablet does do right however all the other reviewers have already done that well."}

IT is fast compared to a HP Touchpad, but when the new crop tablets start arriving with 3 & 4 Cores this will soon be bringing up the rear.

I can only speculate their motive and so my suspect is that these are just trying to start and or spread glowing rumors for the product that has no tech support and can't can't speak to anyone at the company they hide behind their email when they want to answer.\nSo you figure, your assumption is just as good as mine.\nTHIS is a good starter Tablet just don't expect any tech support or believe some of the glowing reports and promises of things to come,  For this reason don't consider buying it from anyone other than Amazon where you have their \"Return policy\" to pull you out if it don't work out for you.\nAlton C Owens"}

The scratches across the top were as if it had been repaired or something. I tried out the tablet just to see if it worked.

The left sidebar is coming away from the screen. These were not shipping damage. Both were well packed with paper padding and airbags. The boxes were not bent of damaged. This is a manufacturing quality assurance issue. This would be a great product if it arrived without the cosmetic defects. It is very frustrating that this was the SECOND one with a cosmetic flaw. I was offered another replacement but I just don't feel like chancing it. I hope others have better luck. The cosmetic issues may seem minor to some but my concern is if I should have to use the warranty. The company could deny my claim thinking I had attempted to open the product myself."}

But with it there are hardly any marks at all, and it takes away some of the glare. I'd recommend putting in a larger micro SD card. Sure, this tablet doesn't have the option to upgrade to the newest version of android, so the interface does just look like a jumbo android phone, BUT it does everything I want it to do. I can surf the web and watch videos, read PDFs/ebooks, play games, view photos (great integration with picasa web albums through your google account), and do email.

After doing a hard reset, then a factory reset, nothing I did would make the tablet recognize my taps, touches, swipes...etc. I did contact a forum of users with the tablet... They were pretty well-informed, nice and helpful. The customer service at le pan couldn't tell me anything I didn't already know but did respond within 24 hours. I will not be buying a new one because it took forever for amazon to even ship this product (and it's would-be replacement, which I cancelled after fear of getting a product that may break again down the line and I'd be stuck with after the return warranty). I will also not be dealing with le pan because they will not release the firmware which I am told they are legally obligated to do according with their license with google. The effect being that the end-user cannot modify or improve their own purchased property (without great expertise and difficulty).\n\nLong story short... I was hopeful about this product but ultimately very unhappy"}

When it arrived, I used it for a short time to make sure it worked & connected to the internet, as I had read about the wifi issues.  I found screen sizing issues on one of the websites I used & also had one hang up.  I then put it on the charger & let it charge overnight.  The next morning I turned it on, it stayed on for a second & then went dead.  I tried calling Le Pan but got a recorded message, so I emailed their customer service department (it was a Saturday) and didn't receive a response until the following Wednesday.  Didn't matter since I had returned it that Saturday & replaced it with a well known brand with a slightly smaller 8.9 screen.  I paid $70 more than the Le Pan, but it's worth every penny to me.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I received my Le Pan II 5 days ago and overall I'm very pleased with it.  First off, the experience is different then the iPad,  the iPad has a very, very refined UI, the Honeycomb 3.2.1 that ships with the Le Pan II is good but still needs some refinement if it wants to have the user experience like the Apple. What's the difference?  It doesn't have the fluidity of the iPad-screen orientation, swipes or the near instant response time.\n\n  What's in the Le Pan II favor? everything else.  I get to choose where everything goes on the screen, the background all this makes it feel like it's made for me.  Also, I get to browse the web like it was supposed to be browsed.  You can choose between the mobile or full version of webpages.\n\nIt plays games very well!  The Android storefront is very nice and I think easier then iTunes for searching for stuff to download.  The LePan II is slow on my WiFi, I've been looking in the forms and most of the people on there think it's because of the router one uses at their home.  I use the Cisco-Linksys E2000 Advanced Wireless-N Router at home with WPA2-PSK and AES encryption.  The forms say it likes open or last generation router security features.  I still connect fine, it's just about half the speed of everything else in my home.\n\nI also have minor backlight bleeding in the bottom right and left corners- not distracted for about 90% of the time. Only really noticeable on dark backgrounds.  My solution, don't have dark backgrounds!  the IPS display its self is very nice, great colors and wide viewing angles and bright.\n\nThe Snapdragon dual core proc with Adreno 220 is plenty fast.  I think it's even faster the the Terga2 chips that everything else ships with.  I like the iPad like sceen size and shape a lot, I'm not a fan of the 16:9 form factor.\n\nThe HP Touchpad cases fit it and are at bargain prices.  I got this one&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Targus-Truss-Case-Stand-for-HP-TouchPad-THZ07202US-Black-Gray/dp/B005BZNE1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Targus Truss Case/Stand for HP TouchPad - THZ07202US (Black/Gray)</a>&nbsp;And&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ArmorSuit-MilitaryShield-Le-Pan-II-Black-Carbon-Fiber-Film-Protector-Shield-Screen-Protector-with-Lifetime-Replacements/dp/B007HIQCBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ArmorSuit MilitaryShield - Le Pan II Black Carbon Fiber Film Protector Shield + Screen Protector with Lifetime Replacements</a>&nbsp;And&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-16GB-Class-10-MicroSDHC-High-Speed-Memory-Card-with-Komputerbay-SD-adaptor-and-High-Speed-USB-Reader/dp/B00698ZWOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung 16GB Class 10 MicroSDHC High Speed Memory Card with Komputerbay SD adaptor and High Speed USB Reader</a>\n\nThe items above gave me a complete set-up, great looks and performance.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend the Le Pan II as a wise choice for the price, features and performance so much so I have ordered another one-it's on back order of course:)\n\nUpdate 8/12/12\n\nI installed ICS and wow what an improvement.  The update process took time to do it right but follow the directions on the Le Pan website and it goes as expected.  It took about 10 minutes total and I'm very happy with the outcome.  All issues with WIFI re gone.  This little tablet now flies on WIFI,  no more buffering on youtube and Netflix.  I really enjoy it and can't wait to see what the come out with next!"}

Tha first three days it worked great ,pick up my wifi,was able to down load lots of apps i wanted,nice screen and videos looked great. it worked so well i bought another one for my wife. Before it came my le pan  screen froze to a gray screen and would not do anything,not even turn off.i tried the reset button but to np avail. I contacted amazon and they were great.they sent me a new one amd it arrived 5 days later,same as the one i ordered for my wife. We plugged them in and the next day we started using them. They worked great for about an hour when mine froze on the menu page,i hit the reset button an about an hour later it started working again. it worked for awhile and then froze again, a day later it still won't work. M y wife,s has worked fine so far{2 days} but not sure for how long. Tried to call le pan but there omly available during the week. I contacted amazon and talked to customer service not much help they told me contact le pan amd if i want i can get my money back,Its a shame the le pan is nice when it works but not worth itif you cant use it Ill contact le pan tomorrow and see what they say. The person fro amazon said the ratings for this tablet says it freezes up. and i said to her why is it rated4 stars it it doesnt work most of the time. No reply on that one. So in closing if you get a good one.its a nice tablet, but the odds are you will get one that freezes up and you have to waste time sending it back. If le pan gives me some answers i will update."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "update 8-2-2012 over seven months now and works perfectly. My wife loves it and is planning on taking it with her to the hospital when she goes in to have our daughter.\n\n**update as of 5-25-2012. still works perfectly after 5 months. A word to the wise, if you are not smart enough to update your firmware just buy the most expensive \"new ipad\" you can find and stop writing reviews displaying your ignorance. **\n\nI give the lepan tc970 5 stars because of quality and functionality vs value. First of all, I got this tablet for my wife for christmas so we have had plenty of time to get a very good feel for it. Secondly, between my wife, myself and my 4 year old son this tablet gets used on average about 5 hours a day. It comes pre installed with official android market aka (google play) and adobe flash player(It also upgraded to the newest version through the market). The build quality is excellent, it looks and feels like a brand name device. We use it as a daily driver and I find it to be nicer than my cousins Ipad 1. It is mostly the little things like I HATE typing in stuff. We talk to our phones, we talk to our xbox 360 and we talk to our tablet. Today we were at a family birthday party and While holding my 1 year old I came to the realization that it is very annoying to have to try and type on her ipad with 1 hand like a caveman to do a simple google or youtube search rather than just press the mic button and speak what we want to search for, and THEN the ipads browser brings up what appears to be a \"youtube app\" like on a phone rather than the actual website like our laptop and our lepan do. I Know several people with ipad 1-2,new Ipod touch, hp touchpad and other android tablets so I have had lots of time to play with them all to my hearts content. The physical build quality of the lepan is on par with those tablets. It plays angry birds, netflix, hbo go, crackle, skype video chat(more about that in the cons), facebook, youtube(it plays most of these both in the browser or as an app, except netflix which requires silverlight for in browser playback). The only game I found that it wasn't fast enough to play flawlessly was gta3, which it plays but with hesitation and not perfectly smooth(I have made it to the second part of the city after they reopen the broken bridge). Pretty much it does what you would expect a full fledged tablet to do.\n\nCONS ..all of these are well documented and fairly common..REGARDING THE FREEZING EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT....(as well as a couple other things)\nThe few problems the tablet has are obviously related to minor bugs in the firmware which could potentially be fixed with a simple update once it's available from lepan(they have released 3 updates since we have had it so at least they are supporting it).\n\n1. It didn't take me long to figure out that(at least in my case) the tablet didn't like us to let it's screen go to sleep ON ITS OWN while it was in the middle of STREAMING OR DOWNLOADING VIA WIFI. It froze once while streaming pandora and once while downloading the extra game content for gta3(both times it froze the exact instant that the screen went to sleep). To remedy this I simply set the screen sleep timer in settings to the highest value(30 min i think) and when we are done using the tablet we put it to sleep manually by pressing the power button. We have not found this to be a hassle because it kind of comes naturally to turn a device off when you are done using it. ........Since we have done this we have had no more problems whatsoever with the tablet freezing........(I did this about 2 months ago)\n\n*****edit. we are currently using update build number 4626 and today I tested it according to c.s. instructions in the tablet page discussions and even after turning the screen sleep timer back down I could not get it to freeze again. This morning I asked my wife when the last time was that it froze on her and she said it has never froze while she was using it. It has also never froze on my son, so apparently it only happened to me the couple times when we first got it and I was downloading alot of apps and games and setting everything up. I don't know if it was the 4626 update that permanently fixed it or what but I do know that I have been trying to get it to freeze on purpose and can't get it to do it again.*****\n\n2. Skype video chat works perfectly with the skype app that is available on the market BUT the first time you run it the screen will flicker strangely, leave the video call running and toggle the video on and off in between flickers, after doing this a couple times(may take around 30 seconds) it will find the right video settings and work properly. This only needs done the one time(unless you flash a new firmware or do a factory reset) Every time you use skype video after this it will work perfectly as expected. I skyped with both a new Ipod touch and a ipad 2, both worked flawlessly on both ends.\n\n3. This is not a big deal but I figured I would mention it anyway. With the stock launcher, the home screens don't auto rotate like they should. It rotates properly in apps and on the web, but not on the home screens. However it works properly when I run \"go launcher ex\" which is free on the market and I figure most people would want to run a fancy custom launcher regardless. (I didn't even notice the rotation issue until later because I had already planned to run go launcher before we even got it.)\n\nSo that is it, if you can't or don't want to spend more than $200, this is the way to go. There is a reason that the tc970 has such high reviews on every site that sells it. It's because it's an excellent device with a beautiful screen, long battery life, pleasing on the eyes design wise, and does every single thing that you would expect of a tablet. You could condemn it for having a couple easily fixable superficial flaws or with a little tlc you could absolutely love it."}

It is really affordable, looks great, is easy to use right out of the box. It was fast, responsive, and fun. It even has a camera and pretty good sound, a big plus. Unfortunately, it started to freeze only days after we got it. Sometimes it would turn on; sometimes not. The battery wasn't the problem; it did hold a charge for quite a while. It just randomly froze without warning. Also, we started having lots of connectivity problems (on our home wireless wi-fi, when we had no problems on our other computers). After a few weeks, we finally threw in the towel and returned it to Amazon. We're not going to take a chance on it again; all the negative reviews unfortunately have proven true.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I was skeptical about buying an off brand tablet with an old Android version 2.2 but am very happy with my purchase.  Most if not all of the apps I use are compatible with the older Android version.  I considered an iPad but the cost was a lot higher and I was concerned about the greater loss if my young children were to break it.  Speed is good.  Be sure you upgrade to the latest firmware before you do anything else or install programs or data.  Also, I suggest you get a 16GB+ class 10 SD card since the stock card is too small and probably a lower class rating.  I would have purchased the Le Pan II but it was on backorder and I didn't want to wait.  I may purchase another Le Pan 1 or 2 because the kids fight over it and I need another.  Netflix streams fine on our house wifi.  The battery life is ok with about 6 hours on a full charge.  A friend asked if it would run Skype.  I don't use Skype but tested it with him.  The standard video Skype doesn't work but there are hacks you can find that are supposed to work.  I got it partially working but gave up when my friend got a laptop instead.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "ANOTHER EDIT (10 days):\n\nJust when I was about to think that freezes went away it froze again. So:\n1. It's not possible to use this tablet without carrying a paper clip along\n2. Taking into account that this product is on the market for at least one year and this freezing issue is well known to distributors and the manufacturer and a number of fix attempts via firmware updates were released the only conclusion is that this is a hardware problem. Which means that they continue to knowingly sell a product that is defective in essence.\n\nSome reviewers are saying that it is Android or tablets' nature to hang. I own a number of Android devices including G1 (the first Android ever) and none of them ever needed a reset. They don't even have a reset button!\n\nEDIT (1 week):\n\nAfter some experiments I managed to make this thing work. Or am I just lucky and some wire got crossed inside after a couple of bangs?...\nWith a combination of the free MX Player (from Market, now renamed to Play Store) and the latest 'leaked' firmware [...] this tablet became more or less stable, it didn't freeze for three days now. But still I refuse to understand how come they are selling a device that's guaranteed to freeze very often without applying some hack like efforts. So no more than 2 stars, sorry.\n\nORIGINAL (a couple of days of usage):\n\nMy aim was to get a tablet for my toddler to watch kids cartoons and play some simple games. My kid (1.7 y.o) tends to throw stuff on the floor when he gets too irritated, alas the price of the purchase had to be minimized. Le Pan was the cheapest one with a full 10 inch screen, so I thought it would be good enough for the purpose.\n\nI can say that the screen is really good. View angle is excellent, the screen is very bright.\n\nBut unfortunately the device is not very usable as it freezes very often for no reason at all. I've connected it to my laptop via USB, uploaded a couple of cartoons. It refused to play most of them, just played the MP4 one.\n\nI've installed BS player and it played FLV ones in software mode which sucked - the cartoon video was kind of slow which caused out of sync with audio.\n\nWhen I tried to play toons it would sometime freeze in the middle of it, or refused to play it from the start displaying an alert window on top of a garbage video background which could only be removed by restarting the device with Reset button.\n\nAnd right now it just froze for just no reason.\n\nSo, anyway, I think that I will be able to convert all of my kids cartoons to some format that this device could tolerate, and will hope that my kid hits it really hard against the wall in the next couple of months which would justify a purchase of a better one.\n\nPS: I've tried all of their updated firmwares, both official and 'leaked'. No difference."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "This tablet is just as advertised. Solid for casual users - browsing, email, games, reading eBooks, Skype, music and video. We did not have any issue with Wi-Fi and speed, as reported by some. One star subtracted because of battery (it drains quicker than I expected, and it takes way too long to re-charge).  Camera is also not so good (using it with Skype), but I did not expect anything special.\nOther than that, Honeycomb is still not as robust operating system and some applications can crash from time to time, but that does not have anything to do with tablet itself.\nOverall, this is very good alternative for more expensive tablets. For those that are still researching, I can definitely recommend (and by the way, 7 inch tablets are just not big enough, even for casual users).\n\nUpdate (June 14th 2012):\nMany had problem with this tablet not powering up. I would like to share work-around for that issue, since I experienced it too.\nLikely cause: It looks that if you leave battery to drain completely, tablet will not be able to charge properly.\nEffect: As a result of above, tablet appears as dead, even if plugged in charger\nWork-around: Use reset button (you will need to use something sharp to press it) to reset tablet while plugged in charger. If needed, unplug and plug charger again.\n\nAbove works for me, and I can always recover from this issue. Of course, this is kind of annoying, but if you make sure to regularly charge tablet, and not letting it drain completely, it will work just fine. Bottom line is, this is design issue, but I guess it is expected for this kind of product."}

When I got the credit, I was charged 20%? Not a good experience! Can anyone tell me how I can dispute the 20% charge, and what are the chances of me getting it back? thx dave"}

This is my first tablet (never owned a smart phone either) so I don't have anything to compare it to other than briefly playing with friends tablets a few times, android OS a little more difficult to use than I anticipated but I'm getting there. Issues I've encountered so far are: bluetooth has been dropping in and out when enabled, can't get the vpn to install on campus but picks up my wireless network at home fine( I even took it to my tech buddy today and he couldn't set up the vpn either), power button is a little hard to press (not a big deal), a pdf e-book I have is hard to read, but I may just be missing how to make the adjustments. I'm hoping some of those issues will be resolved once I learn how to use it and possibly talk to tech support. On the flipside, the responsiveness is good, nice screen, nice build, I've had no issues connecting to Wifi as others here have reported. Overall I'm satisfied.\n\nWill make an update if anything changes."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "This is my first tablet and I'm very much a novice, but I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews before buying the Le Pan II.  I was looking for something to supplement my new laptop, that was easy to carry and didn't break the bank.  I'm so glad I bought this tablet.  I've had it about a week now and it's so easy and great fun! I've had absolutely no issues with my wireless (Verizon) which I found to be very fast - surprisingly so. Overall, I think this tablet is very intuitive and comes with enough apps already installed that you can get started with it right away.  YouTube videos (at 1/3 of the screen size) buffer and play great. I downloaded some games for the heck of it and enjoyed them so much I was playing for hours.  I got over 6 hours on my 1st battery charge and that was downloading, playing movies and games and I even had a some windows open in the background.  It's very attractive in design and with a few add-ons (32 G card/case) I've got a very professional Internet browser, portable office, GPS (yep, a Garmin killer), game-playing machine. Remember, I don't root equipment, run technical programs, or tweak things to the nth degree, but I hate trying to do stuff on my LG phone, which is nice, but everything is so small........\n\nIf I could change a few things (from a novice point of view), I would provide a more detailed users manual (available only from the Lepantab.com website) so I could better manage my installations and storage, etc.; do something about that funny pin connector; add a USB, and probably put the power button on the side instead of top right corner (awkward). No, this is not an Ipad - but Ipad's aren't $280 either.  Plus this tablet has an upgradeable OS.\n\nYep, I love my LePan II tablet. I hope everyone buying one gets a good one like mine. It was a great way to enter the tablet market.... so worth it!!!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "By far the worse experience I have had with any consumer product.  I finally received the product only to have it shipped with a dead screen.  Let me put it as simple as possible...What type of company ships electronics with dead screens?  It is probably better that this happened since with the absence of a quality department in the company...who knows what other problems could lurk on such a complex product.  BTW...I tried to contact Le Pan and was told from a recording that the number was busy.\n\n03/07 Update\n\nWell,  in the race to see who is more responsive between Circuit City (the seller via Amazon) or Lepan,  Lepan is winning the race.  They sent me instructions for the return that I am following.  I have not received anything from Circuit City.\n\n03/26  Update\n\nI called LePan this past Friday and it appears that they have received it and are fixing the tablet.  I am a little hesitant though as they have stopped updating the process.  So here I am almost one month and still without a working tablet.\n\n04/26  Update\n\nWell I finally received a tablet.  This was after receiving a notification from Le Pan that I would have to wait in line since they had so many RMA's that they could not possibly tell me when I would receive it.  I finally contacted the Amazon A-Z team(after that update from Lepan).  I am assuming that the A-Z team must have gotten involved, as I was surprised to received the tablet in the mail on Monday of this week.  Now the only issue is that they actually sent me the wrong model and not the tablet II that I had bought and then sent back to them.  It also seems that the Customer Service is more responsive at LePan as they were pretty quick to response that they were sorry for the error and will send me another one and than I can send back this one.  Let's cross my fingers\n\nSo in summary....if you feel like dealing with \"Peggy\" who is located in somewhere (that you will never be able to identify) and have time to deal with emails, phones call to which in turn frustrate the hell out of you and a wife that will remind you of \"you get what you pay for\"....well buy one of these.  Or you could just entertain yourself by lighting 3 one hundred bills on fire and watching them burn.  Obviously my confidence with this tablet in at the ground floor level and if I have any more problems with this brand,  I will take it out to the driveway and promptly back over it with my car and then go back to the store to buy something else."}

Took it in to work and it connected there. Fast browsing speed, good graphics, excellent key response time. I was happy with it once I was able to see what it could do. I emailed them (it was after hours) letting them know about the Wifi problem. Then I called the company the next day in hopes that they would be able to help me figure it out.

It is sleek and not bulky at all. Everyone who has seen it has been extremely impressed, especially when I tell them I paid $275 for it. I can't wait to play with it some more and figure out all the things it can do. You will not be disappointed by this tablet.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I read reviews for days before buying this tablet. I almost did not buy it because of all the complaints of the freezing up. I have been using mine for four days now without a problem. I did have a couple of applications that froze while downloading, but I stopped the download and restarted it and they downloaded fine. I had another android tablet called a Superpad. We had it for almost a year until my wife dropped it and broke the power plug. It was not very good and kept locking up. We replaced it with a Superpad II. We could never get it to work so we sent it back. We finally bought an iPad II. My wife loves the iPad II. It is a great tablet but I prefer an android OS. It does not have the same app market, did not have expandable memory and is difficult to work with documents. In short I love its appearance and speed but did not like its functionality, also many of the apps that I love are not available on iPad. I think the android market has much more to offer. I have never been a fan of iPhone or iPad because of their proprietary market. This is not an iPad and I am thankful for that. I like this much better because of what I can do with it. If you are just playing games and surfing the Internet then and iPad is fine. If you want a business tool this one is great. And all for the price of a Kindle Fire.\n\nI'm going to do something no one else has done. I am going to compare this to an iPad II from a non-technical point of view. Please bear in mind you can buy three of these for the price of one iPad.\n\nSize. This is slightly smaller than an iPad II in exterior dimensions, therefore an iPad II case fits loosely. The width is about the same, but the height is almost a quarter inch shorter. The thickness is about the same. I bought a Targus Truss case for iPad and it does not fit well. I am ordering one for HP Touchpad which according to the reviews will fit better.\n\nBattery. I have not watched movies on either device so I cannot comment on that. However for web surfing they are about the same. My battery app indicates over 10 hours of web surfing time. After yesterday I can testify that is pretty accurate. If you can run the battery down on this then your spending too much time on a tablet. I cannot imagine a situation where you would have to recharge during the day. It stayed right there with the iPad II all day yesterday.\n\nScreen. I cannot tell the difference in the quality of this compared to the iPad II. Yes the screen is shiny and so is the iPad. They both show fingerprints unless you use a stylus. Screen protectors help but I do not like them, no matter how good they are they take away from the quality of the display. The touchscreen is very responsive but did not work well with the stylus. This may be because of the quality of the stylus that I had. I don't know why people complain about shiny screens. They are on all of your phones and all of your tablets. Get over it. They all have the same problems.\n\nBrightness. I compared this to the iPad II while out in the car. You could not see either screen unless you were in the shade. You can see fingerprints on both in the reflection. The iPad might have been a tiny bit brighter. I have the same problem with my phone in bright light. These devices do not work well outdoors. It is a limitation of all devices. Again get over it. The only thing that works outdoors is a Nook or a Kindle with E ink technology.\n\nScreen orientation. There are some apps that will not rotate. I have the same problem on the iPad when there is not an iPad app available and you have to use one for an iPhone. This is not an operating system problem, it is a problem with the app developer. Any developer can develop their app for screen rotation if they want to. The only thing I can say about this product is that the home screen only displays in landscape mode. However, this is the way that most people use a tablet and I don't see why this would be a problem for anyone. I noticed that HBO go and Max go only display the menu in vertical mode. The movies play in landscape mode just like the iPad. This is a minor inconvenience to have to turn the tablet to read the menu. How lazy are we getting?\n\nSpeed. This might be a little hard to believe,but I think it is faster than the iPad. My wife uses the iPad more than I do, so I had her watch over my shoulder while I did several tasks and she agreed it is really fast. I am not going to say it is faster than an iPad II, but I think it is.\n\n30 pin connector. While the internal pin connector appears to be the same the exterior housing is different than the iPad. You might be able to force it but why would you do that. I do not know why some reviewers would say that they would work. Le Pan shows them on their website for $4.00. Amazon should offer this cable if they are going to sell this product. I think this is a problem. However, the cable is well made and I do not plan on ordering a replacement.\n\nGPS. The GPS works great. This is not even available on the iPad II with Wi-Fi. You have to get a 3G iPad in order to use GPS or order a separate GPS unit that will work with iPad. The iPad will not connect to a standard Bluetooth GPS. Again, another reason to not like their proprietary software from Apple.\n\nPrinting. There are only a few wireless printers that will work with an iPad. Again, because of the proprietary software. All you need with this tablet is an app like Printershare to print to any Wi-Fi printer. Just one more reason not to buy an Apple product.\n\nIn short, you can tell I do not like Apple products. They are great product and I wish they were compatible with the rest of the world. I still own an iPad and we love it, but it is the only one I will ever own because it is so limited. I will never own an iPhone because there are so many android options available now.\n\nIf you have a MacBook and an iPhone, then you should buy an iPad.\n\nIf you have a PC, any other android devices or an android phone then you will probably not be as happy with an iPad as you would be with a nice android tablet. You might like an HP Touchpad, but it is actually more like a laptop and is not an android. I think that for the price this tablet is hard to beat. I think I will continue to use this one for a while then upgrade it to a Le Pan II or III. For right now I am happy with the performance of this tablet. I hope you find this information helpful in making your decision."}

I wanted a tablet to take the place of big binders that I keep music chords/tabs in. I didn't want to pay a lot as this was a luxury for me, not necessity.  I looked at the Le Pan 1 and was pretty much sold until I read that I wouldn't be able to upgrade to the newer Android OS.  I knew that no matter what, it wouldn't be as good as MAC IOS, so I was up sold to the Le Pan 2 so it wouldn't sting as bad.  Im now regretting the purchase away from my beloved brand and the up sale to a inferior product.\n\nThe tablet is only 2 days old, and it is already showing its issues.  Today the touchscreen wouldn't work for scrolling, only tapping until i did a reboot.

I cant wait to see what tomorrow will hold.\n\nAlso, BEWARE:  If you are planning on using this product with a Mac.  I have searched far and wide for programs to have my mac and the tablet play nice together, it is a long and grueling process that I'm still not sure anything will become of it.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I originally bought this tablet in December. Two of them actually, one for each of the kids (10 years old and 13 years old). They had been begging me for a tablet, and I absolutely WOULD NOT pay over $200 for a tablet for a child. So, of course the iPad was out of the question ;-) I had done a TON of research on tablets at or below the $200 price point. I knew that for my tech saavy kids who both have android smart phones and love them, they would need to have something that at least had the \"feel\" of an iPad with things like great graphics, ability to play tons of games and of course the capacitive touch screen (NOT the resistive). For those of you who have no clue what those things mean (like me when I first started looking at tablets), basically the resistive version requires a harder \"push\" on the screen to register what the user wants to do and can be used with gloved fingers, stylus' etc. The capacitive ones are the \"cool\" ones according to my kids, that register the users intended action with a slight touch giving you the nice \"flow\" when flipping screens, easy launch of apps etc. Really, capacitive vs. resistive is a personal choice. I've used both and have no issues with either one, although I too prefer the capacitive version.\n\nSo, after days and days of research, I learned that most of the tablets out there below my afore mentioned price quote had resistive screens instead of capacitive, low memory and had no SD card slot, and did not play well with apps, videos etc. Since the kids use their tablets mostly for game playing and/or video watching while on road trips, those were pretty high up on my list of important functionality.\n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, I too was wary about an new company that I never heard of. After reading all of the pros and cons, I decided that for the price, this tablet would give me the most bang for my buck. Now, almost three months later, I'm EXTREMELY pleased with my decision.\n\nFirst off, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the look and feel of these tablets. My mother-in-law has an iPad and she let me play with it over Christmas time, and I actually prefer the Le Pan to the iPad in terms of the overall look and feel. It's sleek, light weight and has a beautiful screen. It feels like a quality product right out of the box. I think my husband was surprised at the overall appearance and quality feel of the tablets. I'm not sure what he was expecting, but he was impressed like I was.\n\nUnderstanding that the Android OS 2.2 version that comes on this tablet is NOT designed specifically for tablet use, overall, their tablets have run just fine. They have had to reset their tablets several times (one of them more than the other), and the younger one seems to be having trouble with lots of apps being forced closed lately. I suspect that rather than a tablet/manufacturing issue, she's downloaded some apps that are not compatible with the OS running on the tablet. We've recently uninstalled, then reistalled several of her apps, and it's now running just fine. I keep asking my hubby to root it like he did with their phones, but he just hasn't had the time yet. I also suspect that after he does that, we will see even more improvement with the tablets functionality, even though doing so would void the warranty. Again, they were fairly cheap for tablets, and they are for young kids. If they crash on them, then they can start saving to buy the tablets they want when they get jobs :-) The only reason that this review is not 4 stars is because of the need to reset and the recent force close issues. Again, I don't think they are the tablet or companies fault, but I just can't rate it 5 stars without being 100% what the cause is. Overall, most apps play well, amazon video plays just fine, as does YouTube. I have not tried Netflix or Hulu, and probably won't since we don't use either of those programs. Also, I added some music files to their tablets and it plays those just fine as well. They love being able to play music from their tablets when they have friends over. Often they will take the tablets downstairs, turn on the music and have their own little dance party! They are kids, so they are fine with the sound. In my opinion, it could be better, however, I was actually pleasantly surprised with it since I had been expecting MUCH worse based on reviews. On sound only, I'd give it a 31/2 out of 5 stars.\n\nActually, I think my husband was a bit jealous since the tablet he has and paid $1000 for doesn't have the capacitive screens like the kids do LOL. He was skeptical of my choice when I originally purchased the tablets (he is the \"techy\" one in the family) and really wanted me to get them from a known company. Since then, he's conceded that I made the right choice. To be fair, however, we have not had to contact Le Pan directly, so can't speak to their support response times or capabilities.\n\nI'm in the market for a tablet myself now, and am trying to decide whether to get the Le Pan II, or wait for the Le Pan III to come out. Either way, as long as Le Pan stays in business, they have found customers for life."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "This tablet has been amazing so far.  One of the things I do need to say is that if you have any issues, there is an update for it that seems to fix them.  I had looked at probably 30+ tablets, many that were cheaper, but not as up to date (one at Big Lots that was $89, but only had Android 1.5).  I had considered the Kindle Fire, but the main thing that turned me away from that was not being able to add a memory card to it.  I have been surprised so many times with this tablet, being able to play some Facebook games on it, having the full Android market, and the camera isn't too bad.\n\nPros:\nPrice\nSize (doesn't feel like there's wasted space, like an Ipad)\nCan play most Facebook games\nAccess to full Android Market\n\nCons:\nWithout update, almost not usable when battery gets low\nFingerprints show up bad (though at the right angle, almost not visible)\nSpeakers are a bit rough\n\nI definitely recommend this tablet to anyone that has been wanting to get one, but does not have the money for an Ipad or other \"name-brand\" tablet.  I can't stress enough though...get the update instantly, it will make a difference."}

All it keeps saying is \"obtaining IP address\" and then just when it says\" remembered\" it goes right back to trying to obtain the address again. It is so frustrating. But overall when I could connect to the internet it worked great. Nice screen and speed. I have been searching in the threads to find the fix for the wifi but its a lot to read through.\n\nI would definitely recommend this tablet to those of you who are on a budget and need a nice tablet.\n\n*UPDATE*\nWell after hours of trying to figure It out....I disabled the security on my router,  reset it, restarted my computer and tada! It connected! Problem...there is no security on my router. I'm afraid to enable security on it it my not connect again! I'm gonna Google how to set up an IP static address for my tablet.

Wifi only took about 10 mins to set up, only taking this long I believe because of the service provider. Once it connected everything was fine. I tested you tube and had no trouble playing videos. The only issue I ran into was that I couldn't get Pinterest to run on the browser already on the tablet. I downloaded firefox and that didn't work so I tried Skyfire and I've been able to open any site I tried. All in all pretty happy right now."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "Bought this tablet for reading primarily the Financial Times, other publications I now get in paper form and my favorite stock site, Seeking Alpha.  I was lured down the Android path by having a mostly decent experience using an Android Samsung phone for about a year.  Got the LePan II after reading the glowing reviews and have been mostly impressed about how it works.  However, the one site I want to have work, doesn't, namely Seeking Alpha. Going to SA in the Android browser results in a crash  every time.  It freezes in Opera, and loads a blank page in Firefox.  Yet it works on my  Samsung Android phone.  What's the difference?  Samsung vs LePan I can only conclude.  I've had the LePan II for a few days and since we are starting off this badly, I can't just wait for the other sites that don't work either, and god knows what else.  If I get a solution, I'll repost, but for now, I'm not very impressed.\n\nEdit 6/30/2012.  I did a recent firmware update and now the browsing works better (in all fairness, trying SA and other sites on public wifi seemed to work just fine, it's something about my network that the LePan doesn't like).  However the battery state, that a few months ago started showing 50% irrespective of charge state, but with the new firmware installed announced that the battery state IC had failed.  I just dealt with it for a few weeks, but the tablet started going into these states that required a reset to get it to start so I contacted LePan support for warrantee service.  They were quick, asking me to to a system reset, then when that didn't work, issuing an RMA immediately.  That was a week ago, and the tablet is with them.  I'll report back on how the service went."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "My husband has an iPhone for business, and my kids both have iPod Touches.  I am the \"techie\" in the family and saw how much enjoyment my kids were getting from their iPod Touches that I decided I wanted one myself - just to play around with.  Then reality sank in and I remembered how expensive they were and how I hated typing on them and viewing things on them with my 47 year old eyes.  I quickly vetoed that idea and then ran across this tablet one day.  It was something I thought was the best option for me.\n\nWhile it is not as slick as the Apple products, it is slick enough for me.  I have been able to make use of free apps that I use on a daily basis that help me be more productive both at home and work (I work from home).  I use dropbox, goodle docs, open office viewer, documents to go, springpad, evernote, skitch, mint, youtube, facebook, pandora, sugarsync,flixster, astrid tasks, remind me, assistant, kitchen timer, stopwatch, voice recorder, alarm clock plus, the weather channel, habit streak, gmail, mobo task killer, chore checklist, angry birds, jewels, word search, words with friends, lose it, workout trainer, food planner, adobe reader ,etc.  I am finding I am using this tablet more for productivity reasons (work & reminders) that it probably has already paid for itself in the many little ways it has helped me out.\n\nUsing the Mobo Task Killer frequently after opening a lot of apps, helps me keep freezing issues at bay for the most part.\n\nI wake up with alarm clock plus which lets me customize how I want to be awaken.  I prefer a gentler way of waking up as opposed to standard alarm clocks that wake you up by scaring you to death with their loud buzzing.  Upon waking, I can quickly check the weather with the weather channel app so everyone in the family immediately knows how to dress.  No more turning on the tv and waiting for the weather report to come up.  Time for work, it is a great complement to my pc because I can reference pdf documents on the tablet as I do my work on the PC (thanks to dropbox and adobe reader), and I can check email quickly and easily as well.  Dinner time, I can reference a recipe on the tablet as it stands it the Targus case I got for it (for the HP Touch-fits well), and cook up something new for the family.  After dinner, relax and do some light surfing, reading, video watching, or game playing all while sitting comfortably on the couch.  I've even used the navigation app once just to see how it worked and it works just fine in one direction anyways.  I still print out instructions from my pc, but it's nice to hear a play by play as well.\n\nSo I got this tablet thinking I would probably never use it all that much, but now that I have it I am using it every single day and for so many reasons.  For my needs this tablet is all I will need for quite some time even if it is Android 2.2 and not the latest and greatest. I can live without it being as slick as an Apple because it is affordable, productive and fun and pretty slick in it's own way."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "Not only did this tablet arrive a day before it was scheduled, it works much better than the price would indicate.  The overall speed, ease of use, memory utilization and general operation is outstanding. There are, of course, some down sides, but these are minor compared to the overall operation.  The quick start instructions fail to tell you that you have to push the power button twice, holding it the second time until it buzzes, to start the tab when the charger is plugged in, this is not true under battery operation. The WIFI tends to be intermittent but this improves with on time. Like all computers, it freezes at times, but defrosts itself with patience, one trick I found to speed this is to flip pages. The included apps, while pretty basic, work well. As is true of most touch screens, fingerprints seem to appear out of nowhere, but are easily removed with the provided dry cloth. The camera being only on the front side is great for video phone calls or video messaging, but not for taking pictures or video, although no worse than the cell phone I have that has the camera only on the outside making video calls a pain. Overall I'm impressed with this tablet and would recommend it to a first time tablet buyer or computer illiterate user. It definitely is going to be hard to beat for the money."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I got this tablet for my girlfriend's birthday in February 2012. She has an aging laptop that she used for surfing the web so this is a nice, inexpensive replacement that lets her surf the web, play games and read books, at a fraction of the cost of an iPad or other high end tablet. I have been able to compare the Le Pan with an iPad 2 that I borrowed from work. I have used the iPad for a while now, and the Le Pan has several advantages:\n\n-Price. Can't say more.\n-You can load flash websites. It seems with the iPad I have to open up a lot of websites on the computer (online banking, etc never seem to work right)\n-More free/cheaper apps. By comparison, apps for iPad tend to be more expensive/fewer free apps available (and the free ones are full of ads)\n-Has built-in GPS (haven't used it much)\n\nThe Le Pan 970 has some disadvantages:\n\n-It does freeze, it seems everyone has a different experience. This one locks up every few hours, especially if using one program (e.g., reading a book or playing a game) continuously. As others have pointed out, I upgraded the firmware right when I got it but the Le Pan still freezes. She keeps a paper clip handy all the time to reset it. Or, you have to remember to close out of the app you are using periodically, although that is not a guarantee.\n\n-It is not quite as fast as the iPad. Loading websites, zooming in, etc. takes a second or two longer. Maybe the iPad is faster because it ignores the flash content in many websites.\n\n-The camera is backwards. I use Skype with the iPad and it works beautifully, seems with the Le Pan a lot of people report issues.\n\n-It runs the somewhat dated version of Android that according to others, was meant for smartphones. So, a lot of websites open up in the mobile version, which can be annoying.\n\nAll in all, a good tablet if you're on the fence and if you are like me and don't want to spend a lot on a tablet--especially considering that for the price of an iPad you can buy quite nice laptop that lets you do a lot more and get work done. But this is a great tablet to check email/facebook/news while eating breakfast, read a book on a boring day at work or play angry birds. But, only 3 stars because of the fairly frequent (about once daily) freezes.\n\nUPDATE August 2012: The freezing got so bad (she had to have a paper clip in hand all the time), she had to send it in to LePan. The customer service is terrible, it took about 6 weeks to get it replaced. 3 Months later, the replaced tablet freezes less often, but still locks up unexpectedly and behaves erratically once/twice a week (apps won't load, websites freeze up) even after rebooting. So, once a month she has to do a factory reset and reinstall everything."}

I had ordered one from Walmart a month and a half ago and had the WiFi issue that some other reviews had talked about, so I sent that one back to Walmart and ordered this one from Amazon.  Hoping I couldn't get two lemons, I was anxious to get it because I loved everything about it except for the WiFi issue.  Now that I got the one from Amazon now it still had the WiFi issue, but current reviews displaying a WiFi fix helped for the most part, the speed test results improved, but watching YouTube videos didn't improve so I figured it was just the YouTube app and was gonna keep it.  That was until I tried the GPS and Bluetooth.  I have a Bluetooth keyboard that I got from Amazon that states it works with Android. It paired fine, but only stays connected for a few seconds and disconnects.  The Le Pan 2 I got from Walmart I got to work with the keyboard after a little tinkering, but no such luck yet with this one.  Then the GPS.  The Le Pan 2 from Walmart was able to use the GPS without any other wireless connections.  This one I have now from Amazon only works with some other wireless connection.  I don't get it?  I guess I was just unfortunate and got two lemons like another reviewer mentioned earlier, and now I'll probably be sending this one back as well.  I want to try ordering again, but I'm getting tired of waiting and shipping charges, back and forth!  I really really wanted to like this, because its a great product with what does work on it, but its frustrating when all the features it should have don't work properly."}

Despite only being Android 2.2 and having a successor (the Le Pan II) with Android 3.2, this is a great tablet especially for the price. It has exceeded my expectation 100%. It is sort of a 2010 tablet, considering the 1GHZ processor, the older system OS and what not, but in all honesty, if your a person like me who just needs a tablet to cure boredom at work or even just to sit on your lazy butt on the couch and not have to worry about a laptop or walking to your desktop, then definitely get this tablet. My only gripe about this tablet, is sometimes you need to reset the tablet because of some software hiccups, like a system freeze and being directed back to the main screen (meaning the load screen when first turning on the device), but it only happens once in a while, plus it's only happened to me twice. Other than that, I do highly recommend it, I even got one for my mother as a christmas gift. But if Android 2.2 and a single core 1GHZ processor isn't your thing, then a I recommend trying out the Le Pan II, considering the price point and Android Honeycomb and it's ability to be upgraded to Android 4.0 ICS.

Soon after playback starts it starts buffering and buffering never stops.\n\nSimilar problems occur with Netflix and any other apps/processes that require streaming and/or downloads. I observed it even on Google Market where most of the apps are pretty small - download/update starts, then stalls for several minutes at 10-20%, then resumes several minutes later. At the same time 2 other devices on the same WiFi network (laptop and Android phone) exhibit no such issues whatsoever.\n\n2) Lack of official Windows drivers\n\nThere are no official Windows drivers available, so when plugged in device is not mapped to the drive letter in Windows Explorer. Other users reported on internet forums that they received email from Le Pan support stating that they will not release drivers to the public.\n\nI emailed support regarding driver availability and received no response at all.\n\nThat being said there are unofficial drivers for the previous model of this device (970) that has been hacked to work with LP II. I have not tried them and can't comment on how well they work or if they can be used for doing software development on this tablet which was my intended usage (I am talking about development of regular Android apps that do not require device to be rooted).\n\n3) Source code for OS has not been published.

The speed could be a little better, but I suppose that's what the Le Pan II is for.  lol.  Something else I was very impressed with is the battery life.  If I used my Android smartphone for as long as I do my tablet, I would maybe get an hour tops out of it.  But this tablet goes for at least 3 hours before it starts to run low.

LePan fixed it and had great customer service, but it took over a month to get it back because they were so backed up. Hmmmm. . . .maybe this is a design flaw. I have tried to contact LePan about the freezing problem and they sent out a generic e-mail, rather than answered my problem. Sometimes it works very well and most times it freezes. Over and over again. I've limped it along for months but it's so bad I am thinking of buying a new tablet and giving this one to my kids. Currently looking at the Samsung Galaxy 2. $100 more, but it looks like it'll be worth it. You get what you pay for. . .But I'm still not gonna buy an i-anything. Samsung posers."}

The very high rating of the Le Pan I made me watch this closely. Two weeks ago, I finally decided to get it. It was a good move. I got this for $279 on Amazon. This thing rocks....! Why would someone pay $150 to $250 more for something probably equal or inferior? Have we been scammed by tablet manufacturers all this time?"}

Haven't had any issues but I only have had it a few weeks, however, would like to see the on/off button off the edge a little as the case holder corner is to close for my big fingers. No sure if the tablet or the Targus case is the issue. For me? The price was the real deal compared to the cost of other tablets."}

Because it is to top of the line there are things that cheap people wanting an expensive tablet but not willing to pay for will complain about. I bought two of these one for me for work and play and one for my wife for reading and a recipe book and play. I don't see the need to upgrade to a higher android since this one does what we want it to and more. All we did is install the go launcher app (which allows you to rotate the screen in all directions in all screens) and we could customize it enough for us. We both have our smart phones root so we have our own dedicated hotspot for them. Screen is way clear but I think the recommended screen protector is a must because of finger prints. It feels like the original ipad is a very slick device. I might sound cheesy but I love the tassel that comes with it, it makes me feel more comfortable when I am holding it. Charging is fast and the battery is great. My first charge I installed everything I wanted and watched a full Netflix movie on it before it even hit 20%. I will say that my only issue is the Wi-Fi and it is because if it's on and you don't use it for a bit you have to turn it off and then back on when is not that big of a deal if you download a Wi-Fi toggle off the market place also the volume buttons feel like they are backwards but other than those this is a smooth device especially for the price, all my friends want one now."}

Larger screen and some of the books I read have color coded maps and tables, etc.  I almost bought a Kindle Fire but it's screen is only slightly larger than my Original Kindle Version 1 so I looked for a CHEAP 10\" tablet that would run the Kindle reading program (app) and found this one.  I get most of my eBooks from Baen Books so the Kindle reading app does not automatically find them.  I moved the Kindle folder to the micro SD card and copied my .mobi and .prc files from my original Kindle to that folder and now they are all available.\n\nI do not use anything except for the reader yet and the only experience I have had with a tablet is a few minutes with my son's iPad so I have a few issues that will take some learning curve time to overcome.  I constantly touch some place around the edge of the screen that brings up the dictionary and that is annoying.  Sometimes I touch one of the side buttons so that interrupts my reading also.  Hopefully I will learn better.\n\nThe \"good\"\nI can see more text even in a larger font easily.\nI like the white background much better than the grayish one on the original Kindle.  (there are three options for the background, White, Sepia or Black.\nThe ease of turning pages is about the same as my Kindle.  A finger swipe or finger tap on the right edge for the LePan versus pushing a button (Lever and either edge) for the Kindle.\nThe speed of page turns is LOTS faster!\nI can see color maps and tables.\nI read a lot since I am disabled and this unit provide me with a day's reading without needing recharging.  I recharge it when I go to bed each night.  (The original Kindle lasts several days before needing recharging.\nThe unit also has an eBooks reader so I might even be able to read eBooks in other formats if ever needed.\n\nThe \"bad\"\nSkylights and bright overhead lights reflect in the screen so I have to angle the unit to avoid them.  This was not an issue with the original Kindle.\nThe unit is about 4 times as heavy as my original Kindle.\nThe case is a VERY slick, smooth plastic and I also have trouble with my hands so it is much harder to hold than the original Kindle.  I have ordered a (Black Leather Carrying Case Cover Compatible With Apple iPad 3G tablet / Wifi model 16GB, 32GB, 64GB (fits 9.7\" display of the iPad) that supposedly fits the LePan) from Amazon so I hope that this helps with holding the unit.  The weight is approximately the same as some hardcover books so I hold it similarly to a heavy book.\nI am also bothered by fingerprints so I have ordered (For Apple Ipad 2 New Premium Reusable Screen Protector with Cleaning Cloth (pack of 3)).  I hope that these fit, if not, I will look for something else.\n\nI have only had this unit for approximately a week so I might update this review.\nAlso this is the first review that I have ever written."}

The connection speed between my router and Lepan2 is between 1mb to 6mb. YouTube HD videos buffer so much that they were unwatchable. After some research I solved my Wi-Fi problem by changing the wireless router settings as follow: (1) give the tablet a static ip address from the router dhcp section as mentioned in a previous post (2) change the wireless channel to 6 (you can also try 1 or 11) (3) disable security in the router.  Make sure you reboot the router and the tablet after the changes. Now my connection is fine and I can watch YouTube HD videos w/o a problem."}

Ive read every article and review about le pan and I am disappointed on the overall purchase and delivery.  First off le pan says this tablet is already upgradable to 4.0 which is a false advertisement no upgrade exists yet, second in the upright position the vibration from the key pad makes a very loud noise which I know isn't right, upsidedown, laying flat or from any other direction the tablet  doesn't make the annoying grinding noise.  Next the wifi has had a mind of its own on 2 occasions , wifi went in and out for no reason restarting the tablet fixed it, I have att u verse the fastest and most expensive internet available in my area and have never had a problem with any of my devices. Android keyboard doesn't always pop up when its supposed to (just happened), happens with my phone too so its prob Android os not tablet but still annoying. The buttons for volume and power are so small, no HDMI - 30 pin connector isn available yet.  No rear camera is also dissapointing, corners of black screen slightly bleed.  PROS the construction is modern, sleek and very well built. Large screen and Duel core 1.2 is pretty fast.  Lost of storage space and extendable SD slot. Apparently 4.0 os will be available in the future, hopefully. 30 pin adaptor for HDMI in future, hopefully.  Overall good price for what you get.  This is a small company that is making a name for themselves but are still in the launching stages, and this is why I'll put up with some of the problems I've had, In hopes they are corrected down the road.\nAmazon -  tracking my package was absolutely useless and so was signing up for text messaging when package was out for delivery.  Updates were so far behind and I was never notified my package was being delivered. It also took over a month to receive my le pan which sucked. Very dissatisfied. This part is on Amazon and usps, my package was left on my door step without being signed for while I was home.  Not even a knock on the door.  Leaving a 300 dollar tablet on the door step of a house in the dead of winter in Ohio, basically lost for words.  When it comes to the tablet and le pan nothing is a deal breaker except for the grinding sound made by the vibration of the buttons in the upright position, which could have happened while in transit.  I'm still deciding if I should send it back but I'm not sure I want to wait a month+ and take a gamble on the delivery again.  This is the review i wish existed a month ago."}

Still, it takes a lot of the fun out of it when it freezes so often. We don't even have anything fancy on here, just a couple of basic apps like kindle reader, angry birds and math games.

It is my first android device but i have had three IOS devices.\n\nThe good:\nThis tablet exceeded my expectations when it comes to speed. Every app i have tried runs smoothly and the response time is spot on. The graphics are great and the sound quality is adequate. However the sound is not something you would want to listen to music or watch movies with so expect to need headphones for such things. That being said the sound quality is great for YouTube and app sound effects it is loud enough for me not to have to turn it all the way up. I have run into a few apps that don't work with this tablet but, i believe it has to do with android and not the tablet itself. For those people who may be interested Netflix works great and plays in HD. Overall this is a great tablet and worth every penny.\n\nThe not so good:\n\nThe only complaints i have are the wifi and fingerprints. When i first connected to the wifi i was only pulling half of what i should have been getting but, i applied the fix that an earlier reviewer posted and it works fine now but it was a little troublesome to begin with.

Charged it up, turned it on and it immediately recognized my network.  Typed in the access code and was off and running.  Brought the Le Pan II to my sons house and it immediately recognized his network, also.  It worked flawlessly on both networks.  My son was blown away by this unit and now wants one.  And, he is a long time Android user.  My wife brought it in to work.  One of her colleagues has already ordered one and another is seriously thinking of doing the same.\n\nResponse time is as good as her Pentium dual core notebook.  Videos from Youtube, Netflix, Crackle, games, etc. all stream smoothly with no hesitation.  I have not experienced poor network connection, jerky or buffering video issues that a couple of posters have mentioned.  And, I'm pretty fussy.  Any issues I have experienced were application specific and had nothing to do with the Le Pan II.  There is a minute amount of bleeding in the corners from the LEDs used to backlight the screen.  But it is not noticeable when playing any video content.  I have the same effect on a 22 inch Samsung LCD TV.  This is truly not even worth mentioning.  But someone raised this point in a previous post.  Placed a video call using Tango.  Video and audio synced well.  The video coming from my sons end was not great, but he has a low res camera and he was in a dimly lit room at the time.  Will have to try again under better conditions.  As others have stated, this unit has a quality feel and the screen is incredible.  Nice touch sensitivity across the entire screen.  The fact that it has GPS capability without the need for 3G network connection is a nice bonus.  It's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capable.  Battery life is great!!!  We are new to the Tablet and Android OS world.  The Le Pan II compares favorably to my wife's laptop, in many ways, and I can't imagine anyone not being thrilled with this unit.\n\nPurchased the Targus Truss case for the HP touchpad and everyone has been as impressed with the case as with the Le Pan II.

We took ours out of the box, fully charged it, and excitedly prepared to use it for ourselves and our toddler.  We tapped the menu button, and the tablet froze.  We tried for several minutes to tap the screen or press the power button and nothing would budge.  Finally we had to use the reset button.  The tablet rebooted, we tapped on another icon...and it froze again.  This went on for about an hour before we discovered a firmware upgrade (you can imagine how slow of a process a firmware upgrade was when the tablet froze after each keystroke).  The upgrade did not resolve the problem so we contacted customer care.  They informed us that the tablet is prone to freezing when the battery life is below 60%, that we should make sure our tablet is fully charged and wait for an upcoming firmware upgrade that would resolve the freezing issue.\n\nIt has now been over a month since that email exchange and we still have what basically amounts to a $200 paperweight.  No firmware upgrade has surfaced, and we are still unable to use our tablet.  It seems odd to me that Le Pan would put their name on a product that can only function when the battery is fully charged.  This drastically reduce the usability of the tablet.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "[Update as of 2012-04-01 below]\n\nI'm in a rush and will hopefully write a more in depth review over time. First impressions:\n\nLet it be clear: I'm a first time Android user, and first time tablet owner. I've used an iPhone 3Gs for years and have a number of laptops and desktop workstations. I would say that in computing I'm an advanced user, but not an expert user. I do front-end Web development including coding, so I can figure out most things, but I don't have a degree in networking and usually figure stuff out thanks to our friends at Google. So perhaps don't know too much about computers, but I follow directions reasonably well when things start getting buggy.\n\nWhy I wanted a Tablet:\nI like to read PDFs at night and my iPhone screen is just too tiny. Moreover, I like to practice my guitar using online or PDF tab and instruction and well as video instruction. Not only does the laptop create too much distance with the keyboard, but it only allows me to view documents in landscape mode. I felt that an eReader would be best, but I was very unimpressed with the performance of those I tested. I do prefer e-Ink for reading, but the slow processors just killed it for me. I eventually settled on a tablet as it was more versatile. I knew I wanted a monitor that was at least 9\", as most of my documents are in PDF format.\n\nWhy I didn't buy an iPad\nAs an iPhone user I was committed to purchasing an iPad after doing a lot of tablet research. I figured that it was the best performer and I already owned many of the apps that would be iPad friendly. However, two things stopped me from taking the plunge. First of all, the iPads are what I consider prohibitively expensive for such a portable device (which I suspect I will eventually sit on, drop, or leave at a cafe by accident). Second, I really, really hate iTunes. It was mostly the iTunes headaches that solidified my decision to go with Android. I'm pretty good with computers and sometimes can't figure out how so many regular computer users seem to get by with iTunes. Don't get me wrong. I think Apple hit a home run with the iPhone. It is ingenious and I love mine -- but it's hard to believe the very same company that created a device so intuitive that it doesn't need a manual -- also created what could be the worst piece of software I've ever used. That would be iTunes. Fortunately, I found an ample iTunes substitute, but it was only after purchasing my Le Pan II.\n\nWhy I settled on the Le Pan II.\nI did a lot of research before taking a chance on this one. Read hundreds of reviews and had actually given up on Android (as mentioned -- concluded that Apple was the only player in town) until I found the first version of the Le Pan. I was actually going to pull the trigger on that first model, but I felt the limitation of the OS would eventually become an issue in the app market. The Le Pan II is far more versatile unless you root the old one; something I just don't have time to deal with. I spend a good chunk of my time trying to troubleshoot PC and network errors and don't need another headache.\n\nBuild Quality: 5 stars.\nLP II is quite heavy, but the heft has a very solid feel to it; no creaking or cheap feeling parts. Not prohibitively heavy, but it's definitely got some weight.\n\nEase of use: 4 stars.\nMy first real go at Android, and surprisingly it was a no-brainer. Very intuitive. The only reason it doesn't earn 5 stars is because I feel that the app organization is a bit confusing. You can choose to pull the apps onto the carousel sliding start pages, but I don't quite understand why that's necessary. With iOS, all the apps are in your carousel sliding start pages, and you can simply group them together using the drag and drop folder conversion concept -- much more elegant. I also experience some minor bugs when dragging apps to different carousel pages -- sometimes they skip over the destination page, and do other odd things. Not a big deal -- just not as polished as Apple.\n\nApp installation simplicity: 5 stars.\nI was a bit concerned about app installation issues with Android, but all of my usual apps such as Evernote, Roboform, Skype, Google Apps and others loaded without a hitch.\n\nSpeed: 5 stars.\nI recall testing out a few different tablets months ago at a local Best Buy. This Le Pan II strikes me as being on equal ground with the iPad in terms of response time. It's very responsive.\n\nConnectivity: 5 stars.\nVery simple. Connected to my wi-fi network sans events.\n\nQuick first impressions:\nSo far my expectations have been exceeded by this high quality, bang for the buck. I haven't tested everything yet, but it organizes my PDFs and MP4 guitar lessons perfectly -- and so this purchase has been worthwhile. The PDF viewing is a little limited in terms of zoom factor, but I may have overlooked a setting that defines the percentage of zoom, etc. It may also be app related. I have only used Acrobat thus far, but have installed a number of readers.\n\nI love the fact that it uses a micro SD. The elastic door that covers the MicroSD is perhaps the only quality control issue -- it doesn't seem to seat flush with the unit, but this does not impact me in any way as long as it doesn't pop open.\n\nThe keyboard layout takes a little getting used to. Not sure how enamored I am -- only time will tell. I may purchase a small Bluetooth keyboard and give that a whirl for business tasks where I need to do a lot of writing. Haven't found a way to turn off the vibration when I touch the keys -- despite disabling that function in settings. This concerns me because I need to do stealth reading and writing while my wife sleeps.\n\nThe size is good, but not what I would call perfect. Ideally I would like a larger screen by at least 2 diagonal inches and a thinner, lighter body. That would really make it perfect for reading and reading music. But so far, this is adequate--a world better than both my laptop and iPhone. In time I hope to give long-term user impressions for those of you who want tablets for e-reading. Haven't tried it yet in sunlight but imagine it will make things pretty tough to see. I spend most of my time indoors in a poorly lit computing man-cave.\n\nI took the advice of one of the early reviewers and purchased the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Targus-Truss-Case-Stand-for-HP-TouchPad-THZ07202US-Black-Gray/dp/B005BZNE1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Targus Truss Case/Stand for HP TouchPad - THZ07202US (Black/Gray)</a>&nbsp;that serves a dual function as a tablet stand. What a great suggestion. First of all, perfect fit, not buttons covered up. The case is so sturdy while supporting the tablet in various angles that I think it's a must-have item.\n\nNight readers: take note! If you hold the tablet in Document view, you can use the HP book-like cover as a shield to prevent light spillage from bothering your spouse while reading in bed at night. That right there is a home-run. I know that at least one of you out there is concerned about this issue, and it was hard to find sympathizers on Google. Brilliant solution.\n\nLast but not least, the cover of the case is stiff enough that you have ample support for viewing the Le Pan in Document View (whatever the opposite of landscape view is called). Get it.\n\nI just can't see paying $500 for a tablet when you can get such a marvelous piece of hardware for this price. I don't think tablets will really hit the mass market until they reach the $200-$300 price point. Le Pan II seems to be ahead of its time.\n\n-----------------------------------\nEDIT: 2012-04-01\nDespite the date this is serious feedback. No April Fools antics. Just wanted to take a moment and write that I'm still very satisfied with the Le Pan II. It has been a joy to own. That being said, I still believe that iOS is far easier to navigate and the fastest point from A-B. So if money were no object -- now that I have CopyTrans to replace iTunes, I might go with the iPad. But the total upside of the LePan is that Flash video compatibility is ubiquitous, and for my needs that's an important feature. I can access sites with integrated Flash applications, like Songsterr. It's amazing. iOS would be useless for any Web-based Flash apart from Youtube.\n\nI did have quite a scare with the Le Pan where I thought it was bricked. I had installed an app from the Android App Store that is a customized app launcher. The Le Pan went into a continuous reboot cycle for two days. I methodically addressed all the variables. Tried the hard reset with Cables in, cables out, etc. Finally performed the reset with the volume button held down, and that did the trick. Immense relief, because it was my last option. I think this is more indicative of Android OS, and nothing to do with Le Pan as a product or brand.\n\nOne annoyance of the Le Pan II that I have not been able to resolve is another thing that is related to Android OS and not Le Pan itself. This is the hepatic vibration feedback when you push the navigation keys. It's a great feature in general, but when I want to do some stealth reading at night next to my sleeping wife, it's very annoying. Very stupid of Android to make this feature uncustomizable. There is no hack short of rooting the OS that addresses this.\n\nAnother annoyance that I have fortunately solved is that the screen luminosity could only be reduced by a small amount for night reading. I went through a number of apps and finally came upon one which I will highly recommend to all of you night readers. What makes it great is that you can access it from any screen so if you accidentally disable it and your Le Pan is glowing like a torch while you spazz out to cover it up with the sheets, this app allows you to make a simple swipe gesture with your finger and you're back in dark screen mode.\n\nI will warn you that Android allows you to nearly brick your OS by adjusting the screen brightness to zero. So how on earth are you supposed to get your screen visible again if you can't see anything? I had this happen once accidentally while playing with the slider and thankfully I pressed the right place on the screen to get things visible again. Fortunately this app allows you to set a minimum of, say, 3% which gives you enough rendering to see everything you need. Therefore, You can never accidentally make the screen go black.\n\nApp is called Display Brightness. Free if I recall from the Android store. Once you install the app, just add the widget to your home screen. Now keep this in mind since the widget isn't the most intuitive thing in the world. You need to set your default swiping area. Make sure you give yourself enough adequate area. It's in the form of a vertical strip. You can make that strip thinner or thicker. That attribute is controlled in the app setup screen by the top slider bar called the \"Select Size.\" Once that is enabled and you've tweaked everything perfectly after some trial and error, enable the app by pushing the \"Enable Indicator button on the lower left.\" Now, in whatever screen you may be, you just need to swipe your finger down to reduce the light and up to increase. One word of caution -- there may be a small, innocuous bug. Sometimes you will have apps with menu buttons on the top left of your screen. When you touch them, this disables the Display Brightness, so suddenly you have a glowing torch in the dead of night. Easy fix of course is to just swipe your finger down the left side of the screen again to go back into dark screen mode. This app is the most useful I've found. You will thank me :)\n\nIf you would like to know about other useful widgets I've found just let me know.\n\nOther small annoyances of the Le Pan II. The volume buttons are so integrated into the profile of the Le Pan that I cannot find them with tactile fiddling. This becomes annoying, because in a dark environment you just cannot see them. Once you learn where they are, however, it's not that big a deal.\n\nOther than the one Brick scare I had, no other problems. My battery was being consumed like crazy at first until I learned how to manage apps and power consumption. Apple is far more intuitive in this department as well.\n\nMy original use for this product was instructional guitar videos and guitar tab, and it's been perfect for that application. Definitely happy with this purchase. Android OS is weird, but while you have to go through more steps than necessary to get something done, it's doable."}

Great colors and awesome viewing angles\n\n-Fast and responsive. There's the occasional lag, (every known tablet in the world has it---even the much hyped ipads) but it's nothing to worry about as it only happens because of an app or two.\n\n-Superb build quality, feels and handles like a $500 tablet. No issues with at all.\n\n-The common complaint lately is the WiFi issues. To be honest, I don't have this problem at all. Websites and Pandora work fine. Downloads are fast and and app installation is a breeze. Honeycomb O.S still needs a bit of fine tuning, then again, no such thing as a perfect os, (Apple's ios is notoriously inconsistent).\n\n-The major issue I have stems from the youtube app. It buffers a lot. I think the app itself is not very good, and the buffering is the result of a poorly coded app. This is not a problem exclusive to the le pan 2, it is actually a known issue with honeycomb's android app.\n\nwell so far so good, I give this tablet a 4 out of 5 (Default capacity is only 8gb, but it can be expanded). It's well designed, the hardware is surprisingly great, given the price, and it can stand head to head with the other higher priced tablets in performance. It may not have all the fancier features like usb ports and it may not have the mainstream name and marketing of the other players in the tablet world, but it sure as heck beats many of them in the bang for the buck value."}

I finally had to stop myself ans ask what AM I looking for in a tablet?  What will I truly use it for?  When I realized what my uses were, I thought WHY spend a ton of money.  I want a big enough screen to be able to surf the net, get apps from android, read on a bigger screen, watch a movie on a road trip and play games without waiting 5 minutes per screen load.  As you can see, nothing too fancy, just every day normal usage.  This price was perfect.  This tablet has all I want and then some for under $300!!!  I hope Amazon doesn't mind that I got tired of waiting for them to stock these so I ordered mine from Best Buy tonight.  I did have to pay more because of shipping and tax but patience isn't one of my better virtues!  It will be here in 2/7 or 2/8!!\n\nThe biggest thing that stands out to me as a concern is the 30 pin connector vs. other tablets.  The main reason I didn't go with the Ipad months ago was the lack of an sd card for extra storage.  Yes it has cloud storage BUT that doesn't help if I don't have wifi access.  With an sd card, I always have my files available.\n\nI will update when I get my tablet but I am VERY excited about my purchase!!  Now to decide on a case for it......\n\nUPDATE (2/7/12):  I have received my tablet.  Let it charge and proceeded to check it out.  I absolutely love this tablet!  I have had no problems with wifi connections, downloads/installs from the market were very quick and seamless, games are flawless, no lag so far etc.  The clarity is amazing.  The only problem I have encountered is that my husband was watching while I was playing with it and now he wants one TOO! lol  I highly recommend this tablet.  You can NOT go wrong for the money!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I originally had my Le Pan ii back-ordered toward the end of December, but when I saw (briefly) that CircuitCity (though Amazon) had these in stock, I cancelled my original order, and ordered again with them. That was January 27. I received it about 6 hours ago, and so far, I couldn't be more pleased. Immediate impressions:\n\n1. It's got some weight to it. It's not heavy, but it weighs enough to let you know it's there. Not like some gadgets that feel like nothing in your hand. It doesn't feel like a toy.\n2. It feels well made - the screen is perfectly smooth, and the metal on the back is a nice touch. It really seems like a quality tablet.\n3. It really looks like an iPad, except it doesn't have the home button.\n4. The Quick Start Guide is a joke.\n\nAfter my initial assessment, I made sure to charge it completely before I started to use it. That seems to be the main difference between those who've had trouble with the tablet, and those who haven't. Once it charged up, I input my WiFi password and it connected right up. The connection's been stable ever since. I haven't yet done a speed test to see the actual throughput of the connection, but it's definitely zippy! I immediately downloaded a few apps (Twitter, Facebook, Firefox, Gmail) and tested each one. All performed flawlessly. Will install Netflix later on to see how streaming video looks and works on it.\n\nThe screen is gorgeous - bright, vivid colors, and a ton of real estate. Really crisp, if a bit reflective. It reminds me of the iPad screen. Also, it's really responsive - no lag. One note, though - the screen collects fingerprints. Not a problem for me (it's a touchscreen, what else would you expect??), and the included cleaning cloth wipes them away easily.\n\nThe on screen keyboard is surprisingly easy to get used to, especially if you've got some familiarity with virtual keyboards. The keys, especially when the tablet is in landscape mode, are spaced well and are large enough that accuracy isn't much of an issue.\n\nThe speakers are much better than expected. I've used plenty of mobile devices, and I've never been impressed with the sound quality or volume. But the Le Pan ii sounds good! I actually had to turn the volume down a bit in the office. It puts out surprisingly good quality sound at a good volume. Once I load some music onto it, I'll put the speakers more thoroughly through their paces.\n\nSo far, I'm liking the placement of all the buttons and ports. They're all in one location, so you always know where to go. The volume rocker is a bit small and lacking tactile cues (no raised areas or dots on it so you can find it without looking) but I expect with time that I'll get to know its position without any issues. It's a minor thing, not worth lowering my rating.\n\nSo, as I said, at this point, I'm absolutely happy with the Le Pan ii. Glad I waited for it instead of being impatient and getting something else. For the price, you really do get so much with this tablet! I'll use and test it over the coming week or so, and will update this review if anything changes!"}

The first day (yesterday) I took it to work with me so I could watch my daughter on web-cam at daycare. Unfortunately, I spent more time resetting the thing than watching my child. So I took it home and fully charged the battery thinking that maybe that was the problem -- it hadn't gotten a full  battery charge, like the instructions required. Well after leaving it on charge all night and coming back to work with it, I had to hit the rest button just to get the thing to turn on! The screen has since froze on me 3 times and it has only been on less than one hour. So, I'll have to return it, get my money back, and try for the Le Pan II and see if that one's any better.

Pages load very quick. One reviewer said finger prints are a big problem which isn't the case here. I wouldn't eat greasy food and type though, common sense. I went to Amazon kindle and bought a couple free books to test them out. I had no problems loading them. Pages were able to just glide.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "11/30/12: Just an update, I had given this good initial reviews, but a lot has changed! A couple of weeks ago, the power button suddenly stopped working, apparently a common issue. I submitted a trouble ticket, but have yet to hear back, which apparently is happening to others as well. I could live with the fact that it wasn't really as good as an ipad and that it wasn't going to get any further android upgrades, but it's pretty apparent Le Pan isn't committed to supporting this product.\n\nSome of my own expectations changed along the way too. I bought it with the main intent of using it as an ereader and not much else.  Well, once you get a tablet you eventually start to explore its media options, but this one wasn't up to the task. It's hard for me to say if failures were a result of tablet hardware, the android OS, or the apps, but simple stuff like browsing the web was imperfect due to app crashes, slowness, etc. Like I said, assigning blame is tough, but I'm now a bit leery of the Android OS and the apps designed for that OS. I'm an iphone user, so I'm used to things (mostly) working smoothly, and Android just seems half baked in comparison.\n\nSo, I'm parting ways with this tablet and probably going with an ipad. I probably could have lived with this if the power button hadn't broken, but this episode made me realize that sometimes settling for something isn't worth it.\n\nOriginal review: This is the first time I've really felt compelled to write a review, only because the reviews helped me come to a decision on this particular product.  I was in a position where I didn't really want a tablet; I have a desktop, laptop, and iphone that provide enough for my tech needs.  But I recently moved and am in a position where I am riding a train to work, and I am currently working on PhD research, so hauling binders worth of articles isn't practical.  So, I thought of getting an ereader to help ease the burden.\n\nGoing back to my original thought of not wanting a tablet, that really drove my decision making. At first, I was only looking at your garden variety 6\" e-readers, but my articles have lots of tables, so I worried how pdf's would convert to e-reader format (I've read that software is very hit or miss). The 10\" kindle seemed like it would hit the spot, but it's pricey for a rather specialized product.  The 7\" tablets seemed ok, but a little too small for the multicolumn articles I read. I thought that the only way to go would be the ipad.\n\nBut a little more searching yielded this product, which obviously has some good reviews (some not so good too).  It seemed like a no-brainer, get the size and functionality I need at a price that won't leave me feeling too guilty. So I've had this a couple of days, so I may amend this review later, but so far it's working great. Of course, given my need, the first thing I fired up was the adobe reader and looked through a few of my articles.  Essentially like reading them on printed paper, which is what I wanted. I haven't had any freezing issues (yet) and upgraded to the latest firmware to be safe.\n\nAlthough I'm giving this 5-stars (it does everything I want and need), there is one caveat. The screen, while great in terms of size, is not nearly as responsive as the ipad's. But it works, and I'm hoping it'll be a great resource for my research. Like I said, this product seems to be the perfect combination of price and features.\n\nNew addition 2/17/2012: Having used this for a few weeks, I can confirm that it's still a great product. I've made some minor tweaks, I've rooted the tablet to gain more control and access to different apps.  I've installed an LCD Density adjuster to gain a little more screen real estate, and Launcher Pro, to resolve a minor annoyance of the home screen not rotating with the stock Launcher. Even without those tweaks, though, I was quite happy with it.  As with anything tech related, you can always make changes here and there to suit your preferences.\n\nFor the more tech saavy and adventurous users, you'll be happy to know that folks in the XDA community are almost done with work that will allow LePan users to install Gingerbread on the TC970.  Go to lepanlife dot com for more info on that. I'm on the fence of whether to try it or not, Froyo works fine for me, but there may be some apps where I might need Gingerbread or higher."}

The touch screen is very responsive, the on-screen keyboard works well. The WiFi was super easy to setup. Connected to the Android Marketplace easily/ quickly. Skype works well, Netflix, Facebook, Adobe pdf, all good. It comes with a 2GB MicroSD. The Home, Search, and Return buttons on the bezel work well.\nThe camera is not great, but I'm not planning on using that much. The native web browser is OK. The screen display is fine. It does feel a tad heavy, but not terribly so. The packaging did leave a little glue on the backside; it took about 5 minutes of rubbing to remove it. I have read about freezing issues, so far I have not experienced that. I did email Le Pan's Customer Support asking about the firmware upgrade; they responded the next day with the answer.\nApparently there is a new version of this which allows you to upgrade to new Android (this is stuck on 2.2 without heavy manual work) not sure what other advantages it has.\n\nI have a little experience with an iPad and this is a little smaller and I think a bit heavier. The screen is not quite as nice and I think the camera is much worse. Other than that I don't see much operational difference. Of course the Le Pan is several hundred dollars cheaper.\n\n**UPDATE**\nWe have now had this about 4 months. Still very happy with it. No functional problems, battery life is still good. The screen does get fingerprints, but not really noticeable when in use. Still 4 stars."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I received my LePan II from Walmart a couple of days ago.  I couldn't be more pleased!  Everything that I've tried simply works!  When I saw this tablet, I was close to purchasing a BB Playbook, but was concerned with the usability of a 7 inch screen.  In my opinion, the LePan is an excellent size. I feel comfortable carrying it around and it's a great size for use when lying in bed or sitting on the couch.\n\nThis tablet has excellent specs and is plenty zippy when performing everyday tasks. I was careful to give it a full charge before playing with it and I have had none of the performance issues that some have had. I received it on a Tuesday afternoon, loaded up a few essential apps and took it on an overnight trip the following day.  I had no problems connecting both at home and at the hotel.  It was simply a pleasure to use and I appreciated not having to drag around my 14 inch laptop...\n\nI've been waiting for a reasonably priced, well performing tablet that was running Honeycomb.  The fact that it will upgrade to ICS in the future is just icing on the cake.  I can't imagine what I could get from a name brand tablet that costs $200.00 more than this little hidden gem.  I don't think LePan will be considered an off brand for very long, provided they can get their products out in a timely fashion.\n\nAlso been looking around for a case for the tablet.  I liked the price and looks of the Targus Truss, but it just felt big in my hands and I wasn't crazy about the elastic band. I think I found another possibility for the LePan.\n\nI ended up buying a Cygnett Soft-touch Folio with Multi-View Stand for iPad 2.  As there aren't many accessory choices for the LePan, I took the tablet into my local Wally World and began trying some cases on for size.  Most of them would not fit properly, primariarly due to the fact that the ports are in different places on the iPad 2 in addition to the fact that the iPad 2 is bit thinner. It came down to the Targus Truss or the Cygnett.  I chose the Cygnett because it was a slimmer, better fit than the Targus Truss. This case allows me to access the charging port, power button and the headphone jack.  I can't get to the volume controls without altering the case, but that is easily solved by using a volume control widget. Some folks might want to be aware that there is no locking closure on this case, although I haven't found this to be a problem. Although a piece of elastic would take care of that problem...  Also, the price was $10.00 less than here on Amazon.\n\nI'm very happy with the fit and finish of the case and it looks like it should hold up well while protecting my tablet. Also, the dark muted lavender/purple is a rich beautiful color.  Very very happy!!!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "After doing tons of research on LOTS of different tablets I decided on this on.  I was only wanting to spend around 300 on a Tablet..it was starting to look like a lost cause finding one that would do/have everything I wanted for that price.  Then I found this LE PAN 2!!!!  I'm soo thankful for all the reviewers here on Amazon for their wonderful reviews...you guys rock!!!  I see NO reason to spend a couple hundred more bucks on any other tablet and this one will do it all.\n\nMy le pan came in yesterday and I did what lots of peeps suggested...let it charge completely before trying it out.  I never would have thought this tablet would be so resonpsive.  I touch something and instantly it does it.  The touch screen is right on.  I'm using it now to write this review...even on Amazons small search box, tapped it one time and it hit it right on.  The keyboard has no lag time, I type it does it.\n\nSwitching between websites is just as fast as with my laptops.  Every web page I've thrown at it, it loads it right up.  I'm not having any of the WiFi issues that others are talking about.  Every time I've checked my connection it was on 54m...only one time it showed 36, but both my kids were on their computers watching YouTube vids, so don't know if that had anything to di with it or not??\n\nThe android market is great!! Lots of free games/ apps on there.  They all downloaded as as fast as my iPod does apps with iTunes.  I tried a few YouTube vids myself on this and only one of them stopped to buffer one time...not a problem...press pause wait a bit then resume...no biggie!!\n\nUsed the connector that came with it to hook it up to my laptop to see about adding some music...no problems there..loaded right up.  Haven't tried any loading any movies onto it yet though..not really sure what format they should be in??  Is it mp4??  If someone knows, please leave me a comment to let me know.\n\nI really don't see why people are complaining about the finger prints on this tablet...I mean, really...it IS a touch screen...it's going to get your prints all over it.  It only takes a few seconds to wipe it clean.\n\nAgain, most of their more negative reviews for this tablet is because of WiFi issues...I have had none...so not for sure what the problem is for others??\n\nAll in all a great tablet..if you can get your hands on it...Buy one!!!!"}

Wifi setup was easy and you have access to full Android Market.  Battery life is excellent.  The only reason I do not give this a 5 star rating is due to infrequent screen freeze.  Reset button resolves this issue.  Not sure if due to product or wifi connection.  I tend to lean to the product since I do not have issue with Apple Ipod on my network.  I just cannot see spending Ipad prices when this product is available.  I hear Le Pan II/III even/will be nicer!!!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I had the tablet a little over a week now...  It's pretty good for the price, response time ok when playing with widgets and changing screens, plays netflix, battery last forever and its pretty fast.\n\nThe CONS:  So far it freezes but not too often, you won't beable to type on it like a IPAD, screen can be unresponsive or slow when typeing, and the battery takes forever to charge, like 3 or 4 hours.  But as stated before, the battery do last forever.\n\nI don't like that it doesnt have a rear camera but its ok, I wouldnt use it anyway.  Le Pan said LE PAN III is coming out in a couple of months, I would wait for that one if I was you.  but if the price is good, this tablet is a steal.  I have no real complaint.  I paid 250 with free shipping\n\nI bought the HP TouchPad Custom Fit Case  it doesnt fit to well but can do the job I guess."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "*** ALSO SEE UPDATES BELOW ***\n\nI've had this for a couple of weeks now and it's a great tablet. Some reviewers on here have complained about wifi speed issues, but I've had no problems at all (there may be some lemons out there). You'll want a case for it since it's not easy to hold. It's very well made with a brushed aluminum back...but it can slip out of your hands very easily.\n\nThe touchscreen is very responsive, no slight delays like I've seen on youtube reviews of the older TC970 (this is the TC979 aka Le Pan II). For smooth app install/purchase, make sure you have a google account.\n\nI was listening to music with the installed Pandora software last night through headphones and it sounded wonderful! Some have complained about the external speakers, but what do you expect with a small device like this? Most people use headphones or mp3 players for music anyway. You can easily plug in bigger external speakers like people do with mp3 players via the headphone jack or even bluetooth.\n\nPros: Bright screen, excellent resolution, 4:3 aspect ratio (perfect for web surfing), micro SD card slot for expanded storage up to 32GB (buy one with a a full-size SD adapter or a USB plug that reads micro SD for file transfers)&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kingston-Flash-Card-Reader-MobileLite-G2-USB-2-0-Multi-card-Reader-FCR-MLG2/dp/B002RT69QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kingston Flash Card Reader MobileLite G2 USB 2.0 Multi-card Reader FCR-MLG2</a>, not too heavy, Android 3.2 upgradable to 4.0, bluetooth. Plays videos smoothly. Half the price of an ipad.\n\nCons: No USB slot or jack to read thumbdrives, 30-pin connector with no dongles that Le Pan advertises that'll will work for devices such as USB, HDMI & so on (maybe that will change with firmware? Le Pan???) minus 1 star. Fingerprint magnet, a little slippery to hold without a case. Sound not very loud in speakers (there are EQ apps for that though). I have a dead pixel that creates a faint line across the top of the screen. Hoping that won't bother me any worse. A slight bit of light bleeding in the corners on black screens...not very noticeable...but at least it didn't cost $600+!\n\nI highly recommend this tablet. If only they would start stocking it again!\n\n***UPDATE 1/27/12***\nI've decided the dead pixel creating the faint line across the screen bothered me enough to do an RMA exchange with where I bought it. So, I'll be tabletless for a while...hope I can handle it :P\nAlso hoping the new tablet won't have any wi-fi issues like some here are having.\n\n***UPDATE 3/01/12***\nGot the replacement tablet a few weeks ago.\nWorks perfect so far (no dead pixels, wifi works great). I still highly recommend this tablet. But if you get one in with any problems...send it back for a replacement because if you get one that works fine, you'll be very pleased with it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I had originally bought this tablet from the Walmart website because it was out of stock on Amazon. It was a birthday present for my husband. I had done a lot of research on tablets before I purchased and the Le Pan seemed like the best performer for the price (I couldn't afford to buy any of the higher range tablets).\nThe tablet that arrived from Walmart was a complete disaster. It was missing the SD card, there was no manual/instructions included and the tablet had obviously been previously handled because it was covered in fingerprints. It performed horribly - constantly needing to be reset. I was very disappointed and returned the tablet to Walmart with the intention of purchasing a different tablet. My husband however had since read Le Pan reviews and was confident that if we tried another one from somewhere else it might be different.\nSo I bought a Le Pan from Amazon and it was like a completely different product. Everything that should be included was there and there have been absolutely no problems with it a month later.\nMy husband is a techie nerd and he loves the Le Pan. Every evening after dinner he settles down on the couch with his tablet and is like a kid with a favourite toy!\nI have a feeling the tablet I purchased from Walmart was a refurbished model, or perhaps a returned faulty one."}

Fit and finish are the same as you would find on tablets such as HP's Touch smart. It has an LG display that is beautiful. There is glare from the gloss surface but a mat screen protector will take care of any glare. Sound is loud and surprisingly clear. This tablet includes Android's full market. Very few if any give you the full market at this price point. The company also seems to be committed  to  support as new firmwares have been issued recently. There is also a growing amount of support over at xdadevelopers.com Root is available now. Team this tablet up with the Targus Truss case for the HP Touchpad and a 16gb micro sd card and you'll have a very capable tablet."}

I ordered this a couple weeks ago and Amazon had them on back order showing a delivery date of Jan 29th to Feb 10th or something like that, so I cancelled my order as Walmart listed them in stock.  Also, Walmart price is $269 vs what appears to be now $399 on Amazon.\n\nAnyway I just got it about an hour ago, and I am really impressed.  I would only be duplicating what most people have already said, and I admit Honeycomb takes a little getting used too.  The abscence of the external buttons / Menu / Launcher / Search and Back are initially hard to adjust too, but I think I am catching on quickly.\n\nI opened up a case immediately with Lepan as I read somewhere there was already a firmware update, but they advised me it was not necessary and they would let us know when it was available.  Assumption the next update will be the 4.0 as promised.\n\nSome noted advantages are the multiple browser pages and the menu item which displays the running processes/apps, but I have my TC970 running right next to it and want to do some benchmarks.\n\nI installed Netflix and the video resolution was great.  The Youtube application with the scrolling menu is really cool as well.  So far I am loving it.\n\nIf I root it I will install screencast and run a few videos and post to Youtube.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "UPDATE:::::: After spending more time the other day with the tablet despite the wifi performance issues I noticed another problem... screen \"bleeding\"!  I know it's common to see a bit of light leakage but my tablet had significant light leaking from 3 sides.  I obviously never noticed it before since I could hardly do anything without a stable wifi connection but last night i tried watching a movie and it is very distracting especially on a black background.\n\nto make things worse there is a 15% restocking fee at online retailer i bought the tablet from.  now i'm stuck on whether to send the tablet in to Le Pan under warranty and likely wait forever to get it back or just get rid of it and deal with the 15% fee. :::::::::::::::::UPDATE\n\nFirst of all I really wanted to keep the Le Pan II based on the features you get at a great price.  Like others, I also work in IT and have tested the tablet on numerous Wifi networks and settings.  My main problem is the slow and inconsistent data speeds.  The wifi connection is strong and will stay connected but the data speeds are terrible.  So you can imagine anything from web browsing, youtube, facebook, or anything that requires data is painfully slow.\n\nFor testing purposes I was lucky enough to have two (2) Le Pan II tablets on hand.  I also tested and compared the Le Pan's with a Nook Color (rooted), Ipad and a HP Touchpad (Rooted, running android).  I basically ran simple speed tests and comparisons on Web Browsing, Streaming Videos, etc.  Unfortunately the Le Pan's almost always came in last.  It would either hang, buffer or keep you waiting and waiting.  Even the Nook Color had a better browsing experience (speed wise).\n\nDon't get me wrong, the Le Pan II has alot going for itself especially considering the features at an awesome price.  But what's the point of owning a tablet if you can't get anything done online?\n\nAs a side note, I've also tried dealing with Le Pan's customer support.  I tried calling numerous times and could never get a \"live\" person.  I tried e-mailing both the customer service and and support e-mails found on their website to no avail.  I've also opened \"tickets\" via their website and am yet to receive a response or reply.\n\nI'm pretty sure a simple firmware update can fix the WiFi issues but since customer support is almost non-existant, who knows when?"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I received my Le Pan 2 (ii) on Saturday the 21st.  I did have it ordered from Amazon, but with the '2-3 weeks' back order, I switched to Walmart.com and got it for a buck cheaper.  Downside is, I had to pay about $20 in tax.  Still, I ordered on Friday afternoon, so you can't beat that.  I'll provide a list of things I didn't like, so just assume that I was satisfied with the aspects that aren't on the list.  I bought this tablet for it's guts.  I wanted to break that performance barrier for Android devices.  I didn't want a toy, but the inconsistencies among Android devices is frustrating.  So far, the Le Pan 2 is performing like a tool.  Remember, this is a review after about 4 hours of face time, so think of it more as a first impression.\n\nDislikes:\n\nPower Button - Difficult to locate in the dark until you get the feel.  Even then, it feels cheap, and the design makes it hard to tack down once you do find it.  The mechanism that maintains the tension underneath the button doesn't do a great job, so the button feels a little floaty and lose.  This is not a deal breaker for me.\n\nVolume rocker/hold button(s) - The hold switch is garbage.  If you shake the Tablet, it rattles on it's track.  There seems to be a reoccurring theme with Le Pan (Matsunichi) and moving parts.  The Volume rocker which is adjacent to the hold switch is hard to locate period partly because of their proximity.  A blind feel yields mostly distinguishable plastic segments.  The rocker could benefit from raised bumps on either end.  It's nice not to have the face of the tablet muddled with lights and indications, but it makes physically turning the tablet to view the controls on top an occasional necessity.  Annoying, but not a deal breaker.\n\nHoneycomb Fever/Disillusionment - I use Android 2.3.3 on my phone, so I've gotten used to the long comparability list.  Honeycomb is not supported by some apps I use on my Droid Pro.  HBOgo is in the works.  Xfinity, Fios, etc.  More annoying is that HBO denies browser access to on demand content for Tablets.  I'm sure there is a way around this, but like I said before, 4 hours.  I've read that ICS is coming in an update, so they're about to shake the snow globe again anyway.  Not Le Pan's fault, but we should be aware. (I would like my gmail, please)\n\nComfort - I'm not using the Tablet with a case yet, so this point serves only those who plan to keep the Le Pan naked.  The 9.7 inch format is nice to look at, but cumbersome to hold.  The weight gets to the small tendons and muscles after a few minutes and calls for constant readjustment.  The case is slick, so if you stop paying attention to the tablet resting on your leg, a drop is probable.  If you plan on putting it in a case, no worries.\n\nCamera - Not much needed here.  It's a 2MP that reminds me of a cheap webcam...  That's essentially what it is.  No flash.  Literally.  I don't intend to use my tablet for digital photography anyway.  Don't we all high MP digi cams in an expensive case somewhere that we don't use?  Feel free to go find it. :-P\n\nCharging - 30pin connector STINKS!  The included cable is short.  The charge slot is on the TOP of the device (True north, above the camera, offset to the left 2 inches).  This is that lack of refinement I was talking about.  I'm sure there's a good excuse for why is has to be there.  Probably something like 'It was convenient'.  Not that anyone wants to use a tethered tablet, but if you have to, it's annoying.  Charging also seems slow.  Second full charge was 4-5 hours.  Maybe I'm spoiled.\n\nSpeakers - The quality is as expected, and maybe even a little better.  the problem I had was with the placement and volume.  They are on the back cover, and sit at the bottom of the tablet during portrait mode.  If you cover the small openings, the volume is killed.  If you want to experience quasi-stereo, you can't be using landscape mode.  Also, the volume is different depending on which application you're using.  System volume is also inconsistent.  20% may sound appropriate for 20%, but 70% sounds like 50%, and 100% sounds like 55%.  Better to use inside, as the sound is lost in open spaces.\n\nScreen - I don't even want to admit this, but I did notice some bleeding in the corners.  One in particular.  It only shows with dark/black screens.  It's very small.  If I hadn't read a review of someone else making the same claims, I wouldn't have noticed right away.  I DO NOT mean to scare people away from this tablet.  The screen bleeding is not significant.  It may even be covered under warranty, but I'm not sure.  Maybe someone has time to check into that.  Still not a deal breaker for me.  Sub $300 people.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI like this Tablet, even if I sound hyper-critical of it.\n\nI haven't had any crashes yet.  Bloatware is at a minimum (or just not present).  Operation is snappy, but there are the occasional hick-ups and motion lags.  Wifi pickup seems great (better than my Droid Pro).  It's sturdy, but husky in comparison to some of the anorexic tabs out there.  Get a case for it.  I will be doing the same."}

The first one i received kept freezing so, on the very first day it was returned. They immediately sent me out another and we have not had a problem since. My daughter loves it and so do I. She can play all her games, video chat,vox, Facebook , and take pictures. I can check my emails, watch movies, and skype. I have wifi on my phone so she can take it every where we go. We have really enjoyed this tablet and for 199.00 you can't beat it."}

Within 2 weeks we broke the cord.  I am looking to purchase another cord, not looking for warranty or a hand out.  There are apparently no accessories available ANYWHERE! We have called corporate for every dealer who sells this tablet to buy another cord and it is not available.  I contacted numerous times every email address available on the website of Le Pan with no return email.  The phone number on the website is simply a voice message saying to contact them via email or on the website with no opportunity to reach a human.  I created the request as the website says to over a week ago still with no reply.  The tablet worked fine while I had it charged, but if you EVER need service, you will not get it.  This is NOT a customer friendly company so I would not recommend ever buying anything Le Pan.  My brand new tablet is rendered useless thanks to the uncooperative company Le Pan."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I have owned this for about a week.  It is a very nice unit, I especially like the microphone button built into the virtual keyboard.  I bought this for my son, I have an iPad2.  This does everything the iPad2 does except perform well on the network.  As a senior engineer of XXX, I am well schooled in WiFi and understand the technology.  I have tested the throughput on 4 different Access points.  What I notice is that when connected, the connection speed rarely matches the actual connection speed ( not a problem with other devices). As an example it will show 1Mbs when in fact my iPad2, my 2 lenovo laptops and my HP laptop all connect at 54Mps.  Even when it does connect at 54Mbps, the actual throughput using several tools and test sites ( speedtest.com / speakeasy.com / Vudu speedtest...) rarely exceeds 1 MBps.  In fact, the upload speed is normally faster.  I read through the FAQs, spoke to LePan tech support, this is not an issue on my end.  I have tried WEP, WPA ( I would not reccomend this- the Le Pan does not see a constant signal vis WiFi alalyzer available from amazon marketplace) LEAP and open.  All exhibit the same on both my home and work networks.  I have on occasion seen it spike to 5-6MPs, but it is rare and I cannot pin point what it is that allows it to occasionally ( 1-25 maybe connects) to download at the capability of the access point and network allow.  I spent 10 hours changing settings, routers, turning off GPS, encryption, channels, downloading updates, stood next to the Access point, you name it, I tried it.  I sure hope they fix this as its is a clear winner for the price ( I did not but it through Amazon as they are on backorder).\n\nIf you don't care about streaming high quality video and connection speed is unimportant- you cannot go wrong with this.  As another person pointed out, the CaseCrown case fits perfect and is on sale now.  I cannot give this the 5 stars it deserves becuase of this poor download speed issue, it is a deal breaker for me.  IF Le Pan does not come through before my 30 day window is up, I will be returning this for another brand.  Its inexcusable to offer a new product when the original had WiFi connection issues and now this one suffers from WiFi performance issues.  Who tests this stuff?  Answer, you and me."}

I waited about 3 weeks to get it.\nI'm an Android user the last 28 months.\nThe body of this tablet is really a quality one.\nThe screen just as any other tablet is very nice, colors etc.... The negative on the screen is, the finger prints are very annoying ( my hands were clean )\nConnection to my router was instant and remained excellent.\nSo many application I like not compatible with this unit or the operating system, (amazon, direct tv, brightness app etc.....\nUpdating the system took about 1 hour 20 min on excellent wifi connection.\nI tried several browsers I like and I have experience with, none of them works as good as they work very well on my smartphone. Some web sites not coming up at all and most of them has sizing issues and the loading seems very slow to me. Watching videos on websites almost impossible. Even youtube is a very bad stop and go. I tried several browsers and 2 networks with good connection.\nI copied a movie from my laptop it was playing fine but the sound, what a hell? I had to place the tablet 5 inch to my ear to hear something. Maybe it was designed for headphone users but at this point I did not care anymore.\nI tried all these things for about 10 hours, 2 different networks, several browsers.\nAll these things works fine on my smartphone.\nIf I want to have a bigger screen than my phone, I will definitely will choose netbook.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "April 26, 2012\nThis is updated after about three months of using the tablet. I only used it about a dozen times and suddenly, with no warning, it will not power up. The power button is useless.\nTried recharging-it's not the battery.\nI refuse to continue to do a reset each time I want to use the tablet.\nAfter looking online, this seems to be a very common issue.\nNow, the struggle to get the item returned, replaced, or refunded begins....\n\nI will update as needed...\n\nI only just received the Le Pan tablet last night so I may be updating this review as I use it.\nIt powered right up and the screen quality is pretty great and it seems to be fast, too.\n\nMy gripes so far are:\n1. The leather case/keyboard that Amazon suggests you buy along with it is NOT compatible with this tablet. Amazon is taking the keyboard back and hopefully will stop recommending it.\n\n2. Not a lot of accessories for the Le Pan-if you look on their website, there appears to be no external keyboard you can get for it.\n\n3. No regular USB connection. One review said that Le Pan does not accept USB converters. I am in the process of contacting Le Pan to ask them directly about these issues/accessories.\nUPDATE: I contacted Le Pan's \"customer service\" and there is no way to connect a traditional USB. One can get a Bluetooth keyboard however. I imagined some guy in his living room answering the customer support line...he sound miffed and bothered and gave minimal responses to my questions.\n\n4. Also slightly misleading is the photo of the USB cable. The way the cable is depicted it appears that there are two cables, one being the traditional USB connection. Not true. It is one cable-the 30 prong end goes into the tablet, the USB end into the wall charger.\n\nI really wanted to use this tablet while traveling to upload photos from my camera. Guess I'll have to get a portable picture backup that works independent of a tablet/computer.\n\nIs this a deal breaker? At this point no, I am not going to return the tablet as I wanted something affordable to check email while traveling.\nHad I known beforehand, I may have opted for something else within my price range.\nAnd yes, I did read reviews prior to buying but obviously not all of them. Consumers like me usually rely on and go with Amazon's recommendations for accessories...in the case of the keyboard. They should remove that ASAP!\n\nUPDATE\nCAMERA\nThe camera feature is a waste of time. It's around 2 mp and is backwards-so when you turn it on and looking at the screen, you will be taking a picture of yourself. And this is handy how?\nAnyway, I have a photo editing app I wanted to use on a bigger screen so I set it up on the Le Pan (transferred it over from my phone no problem to the tablet)but when I open the gallery and import a photo and begin to edit it, the camera is automatically turned on-I can't seem to disable the camera feature even if I'm editing a photo. My only solution so far is to cover the camera lens with my finger of black electrical tape.\n\nEverything else is great...it's fast and the screen is crystal clear and sharp!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I have tried some nice tablets in the market already, but just tried, not bought them. Why? The price. I always thought that 500-600 for a nice tablet was unreal and no way to spend this amount of money for a gadget. BUT, the Le Pan TC970 is really a breakthrough device. It features almost everything that sells the \"nice\" and more expensive tablets in the market today. At least what it is most important for a great usage experience....and....for 1/3 of the price???? Come on...and I still see people complaining about the Android 2.2? It does everything it is needed for the purpose of a tablet.\n\nI am using this tablet for about a month right now, and my observations so far:\n\nThe good:\n\n- Amazing screen size, format and resolution. Very pleasant to watch movies, browse the internet and play games.\n- Very sensitive and responsiveness touchscreen. I haven't had any issues with that. Fingerprints? Yes, there are some fingerprints...but, this is a TOUCHscreen, so for me it is normal. Nothing that a regular cleaning does not minimize this \"issue\". The only thing I cold notice on the touchscreen is that it is possible to see the touch elements, depending on the angle you look at the screen and also the ambient light condition. I have seen this on others tablets, so not big deal, at all.\n- NICE speakers. I got surprised with the volume and clarity of them. There are 2, for instance. How many does the Ipad have?\n- Front face camera works really good for the purpose it is intended. Video chat, not to take pictures. For nice pictures there are nice digital cameras in the market. 2MP per say.\n- Great processor speed. I haven't noticed any lag, freezing or delay using the 1Ghz single core processor.\n\nThe bad:\n\n- To be honest, nothing so far. I have seen some people complaining about freezing, but I have not experienced nothing like that. I updated the firmware to the latest version just released in the Le Pan website, which was very smooth and flawless.\n\nFor what I was expecting to get at this price point, it exceeded my expectations by far, so the 5 stars are very well deserved. For sure I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I love gadgets, so I decided to give the Le Pan TC 970 a shot. For a bargain basement tablet, it is so close to awesome that it kind of makes its failings more obvious. On the plus side, you have a gorgeous 9.7 inch screen, very snappy multi-touch controls and a solidly built casing. On the negative side, it is running Android 2.2 and takes quite a bit of fiddling to get a good collection of apps. Seems like half the stuff I download thought I was using a phone and wouldn't display full screen or was in low resolution mode. Battery for me drains pretty quick. I don't know why because everyone else seems to think this thing has an awesome battery. I have to say, however, that I am satisfied with this purchase so far. I have netflix for movies, pandora for music, comicat to read my comic books, dolphin hd browser for surfing, and kindle for reading. All work great and in high resolution. For news I have Huffington Post, Techcrunch, Pulse, and CNET. They work great, too. Youtube works. The only thing I found lacking was the games. Bejeweled 2, Angry Birds, Cardshark, Peggle, Where's My Water and Cut the Rope worked fine. Other games like Scrabble, Fruit Ninja etc would crash, display half-screen in cell phone mode or in low resolution. Unfortunate, because the screen is so nice and touch is so responsive. For what I need it to do, read books, magazines and comics and maybe listen to some music and watch a video every now and then, I give it four stars. I deduct one star for the limited game capabilities. This thing is almost a good budget Ipad if only more games would work correctly on the thing."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I had this tablet for about 3 weeks now and I love using it.  I find that it is very fast and easy to use. I only find one bad thing that being the tiny on/off button. However,I am now getting used to that. I tried two other tablets in the same price range. I tryed Kindle Fire and the HP Touch Pad. I brought The Le Pan TC 970 because it was the most functional for me. I like to watch movies. With the Kindle Fire I liked eveything about it but I could not get on the internet with it. And the HP Touch Pad was like a mini computer that could not run the apps. I love my Le Pan. But, I have one more gripe about it, It is that The Lepan Company does not make a case/stand for this tablet. I have been looking for a case that would fit my LePan 9.7 inch display. Since Le Pan does not make a case for their tablet. I have researched reviews on the Le Pan and found three cases that were mentioned that would work with the Le Pan 9.7\". I brought and tryed them (Targus Truss,Acase HP Touch Pad HQ and Hp Touch Pad Custom Fit). I found that neither of these three cases worked well. They fitted sloppy and did not secure the Le Pan Touch Pad. I purchased a black leather carying case (sold buy eforcity)that fits a 9.7 display.  I had to make simple adjustments with a mat knife. But, I now have the best case on the market at this time for the Le Pan. I returned the three other cases. If you are looking for a case try this one. I am give this tablet 5 stars"}

This front view camera is perfect for skype calls. Loaded some apps and books on to this awesome device and it works with everything I trow at it, I would say it is a good worthy to say IPAD contender, specially for the price.\n\nWhat I do recommend when buying this tablet is buy its case for it and also its screen protector with anti-smudge feature."}

Today, I tried to turn it on, absolutely no response. Tried to reset it: nothing. I am very disappointed in this tablet. I liked it, but there is no excuse for it not working already.

Minor issue, but one worth noting.\n\n2. I've noticed that sometimes, I have to tap an app a few times or harder than normal to get it to open. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I feel the sensitivity should be a little better.\n\n3.

The camera is only on the front. Which is great to use it as a webcam, but not so great if you want to take pictures of something other than yourself.\n\nOther than that, the tablet is great.

Once I figured out how to set a static IP address the connection problem was resolved.  The 2mp camera is just OK and not that great in low light but just fine for Skype in bright light conditions. I was able to load and run all of my favorite apps, Netflix, angry birds,etc and even make an international phone call using Skype.  I added a 16g micro sd card that i had and loaded music, photos and video. All sounded and looked great. I was able to purchase a leather I pad case for the Le Pan for less than $10 - fits like it was made for it.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I stumbled on this tablet by accident. We were looking for a tablet for my 87 year old mother.. Basic needs were, large easy to see screen, ability to do email, web surfing, and skype.  Did not want to spend $500 on an iPad II ... Good product but just too expensive for this situation.  Originally had what we thought was a great deal on demo model Motorola Zoom at a local retailer but when the time came, the price was higher than we agreed, etc, etc...So we walked and then had to find a solution quickly... 72 hours to be precise!  Started searching online... what did we do before Amazon, eBay, etc.?..Found the Le Pan TC970 ... Met our criteria with a good sized screen.  Limited to Android 2.2 Froyo but I'm reasonably confident my Mother wouldn't know Froyo from Frodo so no worries there... Older simpler interface is actually a good thing in this situation.  Got it online with rush delivery for around $225 and was really impressed.  Is it bleeding edge tech? .. No.  Does it do everything the low to mid range tech level user wants?...YES!  Nice screen and touch sensitivity is good.  Sound is O.K. ... I have a HP Touchpad which has the \"Beats\" sound system and is IMHO the best sound but wait .. It's a tablet not a boom box!  Plug in some ear buds and it sounds as good as a $500+ tablet.  Connected to WiFI out of the box with no issues.  E-mail setup easy.  Latest version of Skype works .. Minor glitch with video on the Le Pan end only for the first 5 seconds, then works great.  Browser is great.  All other functions work as described.  Power connector is a Apple iPad connector and plugs into any USB power source.  All the apps I downloaded from the marketplace worked great.  My 87 year old mother has mastered receiving and sending e-mail, browsing so she can find an listen to Andrea Bocelli singing, and even got Skype vodeo chat working though she keep covering the camera with her thumb :-)\nFor the price, this is a great product.  I don't understand why this product and manufacturer doesn't get more media coverage .. IMHO this is the iPad rival .. Only slightly heavier than my wife's iPad II, great fit and finish with nice sturdy feel (not plastic), does almost as much (and plays flash!), and is half the price!\nI beleive the new Le Pan II is now out and there are some other models in the pipe from this manufacturer... Should be be considered by anyone buying a tablet."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "First off just let me say I have been wanting to get my hands on a tablet for months after my girlfriend got an IPad 2.  I thought about getting one for myself but didn't want to spend a min of $500.00.  So I did my research and LUCKILY came across the Le Pan original.  I was very pleased with the original but withen a few days I realized the Le Pan II release was near and I really wanted the newer Android 3.2 software.  So I returned it and pre-ordered the Le Pan II.\n\nI recieve it 2 days ago.  And...I absolutley love it!  Cosmetically it is a very attractive tablet to say the least.  The screen is sharp, web browing is quick and easy.  Videos stream clear and fast.  I love the fact that the adroid market offers so many free apps for pretty much anything you are looking for.\n\nMy Conclusion of the matter is:\nI would rather have this tablet over an Ipad and it was 50% cheaper than the least expensive IPad 2 on the market as I got mine for $250.00. The Le Pan II tablet is the one of the best kept secrets in the tablet world today, but I don't expect that to stay the same for long."}

I wasn't looking for an Ipad or anything fancy but wanted a tablet that was able to surf, read emails and watch videos. I was very surprised at the speed, Ease of use and good battery life. I do crafts so I look up alot of new things to do. This tablet is great and it does what it says it will do. If you want fancy Ipad or another tablet this one might not be what you want but for me it is just what I needed. I realize there are some negative comments but this tablet does well. I believe and for the price it can't be beat.\nI really think some give this tablet a bad rap. To me it does what it says and actually even better. I don't give many reviews unless I am impressed so I hope this helps. ( I got a little epad last year and frankly it is a piece of junk. The Le Pan\nis so much better ~~~ and there is no comparison."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I give this tablet 5 stars based on what you get for the price.  The higher end tablets are a little snappier when there are a lot of graphics but other than that, this one is not much different.  This tablet is about equivalent to the Ipad 1.  In fact it's about the same exact thing.  Dimensions, resolution, processor, memory, IPS panel.  It is a far cry from an IPAD 2 however.  Rating it next to an IPAD 2 or high end android device with 1gb mem and a duo core processor this would rate about 3 stars.  You really only notice the difference in higher graphic games.  Or something like Netflix's menu with all the icons.  On this tablet Netflix main menu is choppy and slow where on an IPAD 2 or say...galaxy tablet it's smooth as silk.  Same with some heavy graphic web pages.  Other than that, it plays most games, great for taking pictures/videos, GPS is awesome.  I have one for myself and 1 more for each of my kids (3 tablets total) and we are very happy with them.  Can't wait to upgrade to the LePan III...1GB ram, 8GB storage and 1.5 gHz duo core processor (still 1024x768 res but that just makes it all faster. At 9.7 inches the higher resolutions are a waste in my opinion.  Sure a high resolution photograph will be finer on the ipad 3 with it's 2048 x 1536 res but...so what.  If you're a professional photographer you may need that but not the average user.  All those pixels do is take away from your processor power.)"}

I love it, love it, love it.\n\nThe tablet is super smooth and is very responsive.  I had no problem jumping in and setting everything up right out of the box.  Video steaming is fast and the screen is vibrant.  It is so responsive I am almost afraid I would do something wrong,lol.\n\nFor the money I must say that the other android tablets should watch out as Le pan has officially made itself a contender.  I am in loving this tablet. In fact I am typing my review on it.\n\nTHE BAD\n\nI found that there are certain apps that will not work with honeycomb at least from what I have gathered not yet.  I was really disappointed when I went to the market to download HBO GO, and MAX GO and they were no where to be found,  however after a little research I found out that they were not compatable with honeycomb. I guess they are working it it.\n\nBACK TO GOOD\n\nWith that said I must admit that it is an amazing tablet.  Its fast, responsive,  oh yeah and it automatically corrects my spelling when I type, whey 2 go Le Pan.  Can't wait to upgrade to ice cream sandwich.\n\nIf you weren't sure if you wanted to get this tablet, take my advice don't think about it do it, do it right now."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "My Le Pan tablet is really nice and it is fast, and has a great screen view.  It is a solid piece of business.  Other than the smudge-magnet screen, I have no complaints.  My review title is based more in the view of tablets in general, and perhaps Android in particular.  You see, the thing does not seem to do anything I am interested in doing, or conversely, it does only those things I am not interested in doing. While it easily set up a Gmail account, which I did not really want, it is unable to set up a Yahoo Mail account, which I desperately did want.  While I wanted to increase my productivity, without email this thing is really just a hunk of plastic and aluminum. I have also failed (about 20 times) to get an Amazon Apps account set up.  Interestingly, neither Yahoo nor Amazon have been any help at all.\n\nI have already paid for and downloaded a number of productivity apps (through the Google Market that comes in the Le Pan), but they are moot without the email.  If you like Android and tablets, this unit is excellent.  I, however, am going to stop hauling this thing back and forth to work; it is simply a time waster.\n\n06.01.2012:\n\nMost of the issues I mention above have been corrected; I have Yahoo Mail.  Unfortunately, I have grown to dread using this tablet.  I type a lot, but the virtual keypad here is so sensitive that I hate using it.  Also, the unit seems to have weak WiFi reception.  So I leave my rating the same."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "Ok, just received my Le Pan II. I have had a Le Pan \"I\" for about a month so I can make some comparisons. The case is identical except I think they redesigned the power button so it is not so easy to accidently hit it. Hd video- On the Le Pan I, I was unable to watch some HD Music videos. They would freeze after 30 seconds to a minute or just get unwatchably choppy. The II played them instantly and smoothly. Youtube plays in hd without having to go the \"dolphin browser Connect as Ipad route\"Wi Fi connected without any problem. I do not have an \"N\" router so My connection speed right now is 54mbps. As far as HDMI output, I am not sure how that is accomplished. The supplied cable is the same as the I. There are no instructions in the quick start guide regarding that and no connectors available on the Le Pan site. They say it will do it but I can't confirm that right now. Per Le pan Hdmi out can be achieved with a 30pin to hdmi adapter .\n\nI am at work right now and I need to let this baby charge up, so I will be exploring it more tonight. So far I think it fixes all the little frustrations we have all had with the le pan I. Time will tell.\n\nI have had a little more time to play with it and I must say it is awesome. The only downside I can see at this time is it does not get as loud as the Le Pan I for some reason. That is a bit disappointing. The browser in honeycomb is really nice has tabs like dolphin and  google chrome."}

Mine still works perfectly.  I have had it physically powered off for only about 2 weeks during this 2 year period, I literally just set it to sleep mode when not in direct use by myself.  Even with that constant use my battery life is still nearly what it was when I bought it.  When the tablet gets to about 35% battery I charge it up (usually to full if time allows).  I have a bit of an issue with bringing it out of sleep.  I press the power button and sometimes get no response.  I simply hold the power button and it wakes up asking if I want to power down.  I select \"no\" and log in just fine.  I do not use my tablet non-stop like I did initially, but it is always working and still does everything it did before.  My parent's Le Pan I's are still working fine for them.  I also convinced my roommate and another friend to get Le Pan II's earlier this year.  My roommate loves his and has found it invaluable for using recipes, watching youtube videos, and a few other purposes.  He has had his with constant use for about 3 months now and no problems.  My other friend got hers earlier this week.  I shall update when I can about her response to it, but thus far it is working just like mine and she loves it.\n\nUpdate 4 August 2012:  ICS has been released and it is working very well.  Flash support on chrome is giving me some trouble, but Dolphin browser still has it working fine.  ICS is nice and runs a bit smoother.  I cannot get the HDMI mirroring to work (and now have the official Le Pan cable for it) so if that is important wait on the upgrade.  I am really enjoying ICS far more than I thought I would.  I remade the attached video in a streamlined format with ICS and it is on youtube, just search \"le pan ice cream sandwich\" and I think it comes up.  Since I think they still ship with Honeycomb I am leaving the old video up for now.\n\nUpdate 23 May 2012:  I am still very pleased with my tablet.  I have had almost no problems, and the few I have had were fixed with a reset.  I leave my tablet on all the time.  All the time.  The total time it has spent physically off since I got in Jan is less than 3 days.  I still have good battery life and things are great.  Quick note since this generation of tablets is being replaced by newer models(transformer prime, Ipad 3, etc).  You can now find comparable tablets with good options in the ballpark of this price.  Part of my emphatic nature of recommending this tablet originally was that all comparable tablets at the time were $400 or more.  Le Pan II is still certainly a contender.  One advantage this tablet still has is being nearly the only Android tablet of 4:3 ratio.  I find that very comfortable for web browsing.  If that is not a big deal you could probably get a Xoom or some such that is comparable and possibly better depending on the price, though most are refurbs versus Le Pan being for a new unit.  I still recommend this tablet, but the progression of technology marches on.  Also if you have a Roku and get an android device check out Gregg Reno's apps for Roku;&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Juice-for-Roku/dp/B007AJR13I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Juice for Roku</a>&nbsp;is the app I use second most.  It is only beaten out by the browser on my tablet.  I have a surround sound system and now my tablet is graphical radio control; it is awesome for anyone with a lot of mp3s.\n\nVideo:\nIn my video I show basic functions, google applications, amazon applications, built in camera, music and video demos.  Much of the bullet list of pros and cons are still best seen in the review below.  It ran kind of long, so I cut it back for amazon's requirements.  Sorry again for the length of it and my written review, but there is so much to say about this tablet.  I very much hope it helps people make informed decisions.\n\n**Also the tablet accesses Google Play (my video was before the switch when it was Android Market, but it still allows access to all the Google apps and markets).\n\nOriginal review:\n\nLet me start by saying that I purchased the TC970 (previous model) back in October, and after 2 months was excited about the Le Pan II.  I have had the Le Pan II for a few hours and am really enjoying it already.  Originally I was wary about the unknown company, but took a chance.  It was the best move I have ever made since I got a reliable Ipad quality device at a fraction of the price.  I shall comment more on that in the company section.\n\nBasics:\n**Pros:\nIt has a nice professional build and feels solid, no cheap plastic feel here.  All quality.\n\nFast processor, boots in about 30 seconds, quick start on apps, and can run many with no problems.\n\nIt has a 4:3 aspect ratio like the Ipad, which I find more comfortable for web browsing than the 16:9 tablets.\n\nFully functioning android market.\n\nYoutube app works great.\n\nSyncs with Gmail just fine.\n\nBeautiful high definition screen.\n\nFull Flash support.\n\nSensitive screen with good response on keyboard, I can type about 30 words per minute on the tablet (~90 on a real keyboard) and it keeps up just fine (my speed is going up as I get used to the onscreen keyboard).\n\nNo problems with Wifi, good signal.\n\nGood accelerometer, can use it to play games easily and works well with google sky map.\n\nDecent microphone with wide pick up (I use a frequency analyzing program).\n\n**Cons:\nProprietary 30 pin connector, but it comes with a USB connection and charger (so only kind of annoying).\n\nNo USB ports, do not get keyboards that connect through USB (it does support Bluetooth so you can get accessories, but only with Bluetooth).\n\nNo rear camera (no big deal to me, I have a digital camera anyway), and front facing camera is only 2MP.\n\n**Notes:\nThe speakers are above average for portable devices (almost no portable devices have good speakers since good bass usually needs larger speakers).  These are pretty good overall, but for audio excellence in any portable device you need a good pair of headphones.\n\nI have not tried to connect this tablet to my TV with HDMI, I still need to get the adapter, but will update after I try.  It does not come with the connector initially (at this time anyway).\n\nI expect it will function similar to the TC970, so the battery life should hold for about 7 hours even with constant video use.  I almost never turned my old one off, just sleep mode.  It can run for days easily in sleep mode.  With intermittent use I would only charge every 3 days or so and expect the Le Pan II to perform about the same.\n\nCases:  I use an off-brand case designed for the HP touchpad (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/HHI-HP-TouchPad-Folio-Flip-Case-with-Muti-Function-Stand-Purple-Package-include-a-HandHelditems-Sketch-Stylus-Pen/dp/B005ILV4II/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">HHI HP TouchPad Folio Flip Case with Muti-Function Stand - Purple (Package include a HandHelditems Sketch Stylus Pen)</a>), and it works well.  I had to cut it a little to use the camera and access volume, and I have to remove it from the case to charge it.  However, I got the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Targus-Truss-Case-Stand-for-HP-TouchPad-THZ07202US-Black-Gray/dp/B005BZNE1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Targus Truss Case/Stand for HP TouchPad - THZ07202US (Black/Gray)</a>&nbsp;for my mother and this will fit the Le Pan II (identical size to the TC970) perfectly and allow easy access to all ports.  In general you can use any case designed for Ipad or Touchpad, but may need to cut a little free for all the ports to be open.\n\nInterface:\n**Pros:\nLatest OS (honeycomb with possible upgrade to ICS)\n\nRuns all online video well.  My main problem with the last version was that I could not watch amazon prime videos on it.  Partly it was the hardware, and partly android 2.2.  This tablet runs amazon streaming just fine, as well as Blip.tv, and comedy central's videos (just the few I have tested).  I do not have Netflix, but the reviews of the last tablet (TC970) said that it worked fine with the Netflix app and I expect this one will too.\n\n**Cons:\nNone really.  I got used to the simplicity of Froyo, so Honeycomb is proving challenging to adapt to, but I still figured everything I wanted to do out within an hour or so of playing with it.\n\nTying into the last point, the previous version the TC970 may be a little easier for the non-technical people to use.  My parents can use Android 2.2 with little trouble, but I think it would be tougher for them to use Honeycomb.  I got this one to try amazon streaming (which worked) but the TC970 was easy to use and could do almost everything.  If ease of use is a priority, you might consider the 970.  I might change my mind as I get more used to Honeycomb though, it might just seem more confusing having gotten used to one and having to switch.\n\n**The Company Le Pan:\nLike I said above, I have had the TC970 for over 2 months.  I take it everywhere and love it.  The new Le Pan II is replacing it, and my mom is getting my old one.  In the months of using the TC970 I can count the number of resets I had to do on one hand.  I had one booting issue over Christmas weekend.  Tech support for Le Pan opened again on Tuesday morning.  By 9am on Tuesday I got a response to my email for tech support and opened a ticket.  By the end of the day I had my tablet up and running again.  I was impressed with the professional and attentive support I got from Le Pan.  My father's and brother's tablets (also TC970s) have had no tech problems at all.\n\ntl,dr:  This is an excellent tablet with top end specs and abilities.  It has played every online video I can throw at it well (including Amazon Prime streaming).  Do not be frightened of the unknown company, I was at first, but the products are great and I have first hand experience with tech support and it was more than adequate.  I cannot recommend this or the previous TC970 enough, especially at the price.\n\nThe battery life on the original 970 is better than this one (expected since this has twice the processor power), but this one is still what they quote.  Good 7 hours of straight use off of a single charge.  It loses about 1% per hour while asleep.\n\nFinally, on the video.  I can run every video I have tried, except Hulu.  Hulu identifies the device as mobile and will not let you play anything (I think this is something on Hulu's end).  I was able to watch Hulu on my old 970 indirectly with Playon, but it requires you to have a computer running the software nearby.  It worked fine though, and I could watch regular Hulu (I do not have Plus to test).  Trying on the 979 it seems to crash when I start the video, I expect it is an issue in Playon's app though, and will follow up with them.  Thus far Hulu is the only online video I can not get to work on the Le Pan II, and that is because it just blocks any mobile device it seems."}

To be honest the quality of the build is high the manufacture used good quality for a china tab. I am a heavy user of video and internet this tab is basically my PC. My frustration started on the 1st day with the tablet it would constantly freeze not to be confused with a forceclose. I would be using the tablet and it would just freeze constant using multiple different applications. So I contacted the tech support and they where fast in their response. They advised me to update my firmware which I did immediately to version 4431. After the firmware update I am still having issue but now the tablet also freezes when it when it go to sleep mode. Again I place a support ticket the IT support advised me to turn on USB debugging under development and to select an option called leave on while charging. It still freezes to the point I have to press the reset button 3-5 times a day. This is not my 1st tablet and I am not new to Android this tablet is a paper weight. I will not recommend this tablet to anyone, which is sad because this is a great unit and there is no reason it has these issues.

A Atrix Android phone, so I really didn't need a tablet, but this one was so reasonably priced, and I was curious about reading books on one, but didn't want a Kindle that you have to use a light to read at night in bed. And iPad's were just way too expensive. I got it right before Christmas, so haven't had a lot of time to add a bunch of apps, but LOVE IT. I read in the bathtub, so was worried about that, but a gallon zip lock fits it perfectly (just in case I get water on it). And am loving reading it there and in bed at night. Have used the GPS (google maps) and may look in to a better one, but live in small town, so it isn't really something I need much. It opened up, and looks just like my android phone, so felt right at home. I used to have an iPhone, but traded up to Android. I'm nearly 68 years old, but have alwyas been a geek, so I like the control that android gives me, over a controlled iphone or ipad. So for only about 4 weeks of ownership.. I have to say its a great deal! Its fast, has a beautiful screen and resolution (same as iPads) at a fraction of the cost.

After Christmas day, everyone was clamoring for the Le Pan and the Ipad went unused until it was taken back to school.  The Le Pan's screen was chrisper and touch controls more fluid.  The Ipad seemed glitchy and did not respond as well to touch.\n\nWe were initially worried about the apps for the Android tablet.  After getting on the Android Marketplace site, those fears were put to rest.  There are a ton of free and pay applications for the system.\n\nThough it was purchased for my daughter, my wife is using it more and more.  She asked about getting one for herself.  It's really that nice."}

I can surf the net and go to any site, watch YouTube videos or whatever. It does far more than the Ipad 1 that I have. It is light weight and very thin, I believe if I dropped it it would break. Overall it is well worth the money."}

For $2 on Amazon I bought a program and down loaded it and the movies on a card and it works well. The battery after running for about 2 1/2 hours shows 60% left so I assume it would be good for about 7 hours.\nThe Wife wanted to try it so I ended up buying her one also. She likes to read books on her Kindle and the Le Pan comes already loaded with Kindle software which is one use she is using it for. So far only a couple of issues with hers and none with mine.\nShe has had a problem logging on the internet even when she is sitting in my office where the router is so it isn't a signal strength issue. She has also had it shut off when she is using it and finds some times when reading a book the page turn is not working right.\n\nThere were some complaints over the on and off button but we don't have a problem with it, it is easy to use.\n\nI only gave it four stars not because it is bad but you get what you pay for so it isn't a Samsung or Apple but dollar for dollar it would be a six star in the applications I use it for. If I had a any issue with it, it would be that there isn't a microphone so using something like Skype is not a option."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "Lots of positive words already written about the TC970 and I will have to say, for a tablet this size and at this price ($200) it's impressive.  Easy to set up, clear screen, fairly quick, it would be difficult at this time to recommend anything else for the price unless you are looking for a reader.  The problem I have is, for me, support is very important.  I took a chance on a no-name tablet not knowing if Le Pan would provide support or even be around in a few months to provide support.  I was also concerned about purchasing electronics from Amazon rather than a local Best Buy or Walmart where I know I could return the unit if I had problems.\n\nInitially the unit worked, for two days, then the power on/off switch failed.  I opened a case with Le Pan on 12/20 and two weeks later....crickets.  No email, no phone call.  I was pretty sure the unit would need to be replaced, but before contacting Amazon I wanted to make sure there wasn't an easy fix, although I had reset the unit and tried some other things.\n\nI sent it back to Amazon for a replacement.  Amazon said the replacment would arrive in a week, it actually arrived in 4 days.  Very happy with Amazon at this point.\n\nI can't say yet whether the Le Pan is a pass, no one produces a 100% reliable product.  If Le Pan had responded I would give the unit 5 stars, assuming the next one works.  Since I just received the unit time will tell, but since they did not respond I would have to say at best, buyer beware.  There are tablets where the manufacturer will support their product.  If this one fails too, I will update.\n\nBecause this is a product review and not a review of Amazon I have to deduct 2 stars for the failure of the tablet and lack of support.  If the new one fails, it goes to a 1.  However, if I was rating Amazon, its an easy 5.\n\n1/23/12\nI received the new unit and it has worked so far, but there was a small chip at the top of the glass.  Soon the chip grew into a crack.  This one is now going back too.  There just does not appear to be any quality built into this product.  And as I stated above, no support from the manufacture.  I would highly recommend passing on the Le Pan and looking at a name brand unit.\n\n1/26/12\nNow the second unit is starting to have issues.  The second replacement is on the way otherwise I would just return for something else.  Purchasing this unit is a mistake.  Don't be tempted by the price.  Yes, its a good unit for the $200, but the probability of failure when you receive it or a short time later is too high.  The quality control is poor and the company does not support their product.\n\n3/23/12\nConsidering all the issues and no company support, I gave up and sent it back for good.  Going to look at the Fire or something else that is supported.  Too bad, for the price its unbeatable, if I could just get past that annoying it never works thing."}

He loves it! :) I love it!\n\nIt does take a little getting used too, but it didn't take but a day of playing around with this tablet to know the ins and outs of how it works.\n\nI am very impressed with the GPS feature and the Talk Google feature.  The Picture and Sound is incredible!  I am able to listen to Youtube videos.  I did download Look Out Security  & Adobe Flash -  2 very MUST HAVE apps to\nProtect your Tablet  & Adobe Flash to get the most out of your tablet Pc.\n\nI wasn't able to do the update, but everything was working just fine.  I spoke with Customer Service (Very Friendly, and Quick Response the couple times I had spoke and emailed them) Customer Service said there was\nno reason for me to do the update if it was working fine.  I agree, its been working just fine.\n\nI downloaded several apps for my son, so he could actually start using it right away on Christmas Day.\nI did discover that I had Yahoo Messenger and Facebook both running in the background and I didn't realize that, and it made my mic stop working.  I went into the settings and stopped running those 2 apps (which I thought I had already closed) Turned the Tablet off and back on, and the mic has worked fine every since.  My son downloaded\nSkype and Skyped with his Friends.\n\nThe case Amazon had suggested that go with this Tablet,(  10.2\" Synthetic Leather Case with Keyboard and Stylus Pen for ePad and aPad (Black)) didn't work. Honestly, I had ordered this together with the tablet per Amazon's suggestion, if I would have known how good the virtual keyboard that is built right in the tablet worked, I wouldn't have bothered going with amazon suggestion to purchase with this tablet.\n\nAmazon (since it was their suggestion and error)Amazon Fully Refunded my money, and Thanks to some Previous Reviewers (Thank You)  I discovered this Tablet cover works nicely with this tablet:\n\nHowever, I still strongly suggest a Case to Protect your tablet:  (this one works Fabulous with this tablet)\nThe Case that Does Work with this Tablet is:\nTargus Truss Leather Carrying Case with Stand for Apple iPad 16GB, 32GB, 64GB WiFi and WiFi + 3G THZ022US (Black/Turquoise Interior)\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Targus-Carrying-THZ022US-Turquoise-Interior/dp/B003VANVB6/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1325843718&sr=1-1\n\nIt is a fingerprint magnet.  So, I have on order a Screen protector and some stylus pens to help with this :)\n\nFor $198 (that is the cost around Thanksgiving) We were pleased! :)\n\nI was so impressed, I ordered a LePan II for myself, Glad I preordered for $262 for the LePan II - I see it went up to around $300.  Looking forward to my LePan II coming next week, and I will review and post about that one too!\n\nYou will NOT be DISAPPOINTED with this TABLET!

I thought I would let it sit overnight until discharged and then I would plug it in and recharge it.  WRONG..!!!!\nTablet is DEAD.  I contacted LePan customer support and after 4 days of back and forth correspondence, they could not figure out what was wrong.  I tried their instructions on factory reset, hard reset and power button and down volume toggle.  NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING.  Their response finally was: I guess we can send you a new one to replace, but you'll have to wait a month.  Maybe that one will be better......REALLY GUYS..?????  Come on.  Customer Service should be a bit more experienced and helpful, especially, since you're a new company trying to launch a new product on to a crowded market.  Regardless, I think I'll keep looking.

I don't think the speakers are as bad as many have stated. Support so far has been good and prices for extra cables, etc is reasonable.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "A couple of months ago, I had purchased the newer version of the Lepan Android Tablet, the Lepan II  for $260.  For the price paid, I was not totally satisfied with its performance.  I returned it and bought the previous older model of the  LePan  Android 2.2 Froyo for only $130.  This older model is just as good as the newer more expensive one.  I am so totally captivated by it.  First of all, just bear in mind it is not an Ipad or a Samsung  Galaxy Pad, but neither is the price.  So with that in mind,  do not expect somersaults out of it.  It has a beautiful bright almost 10\" screen.  It downloads and plays many movies and tv shows from Netflix, Youtube, TV.com, NBC Nightly News, The Rachael Maddow Show, Newsy, CNN, CBC/The National, (Canadian nightly news show), Crackle TV, PBS, C-SPAN/Washington Journal.  In addition it is a great EREADER.  I have been able to download many national and international Newspapers, and magazines like Time magazine to mention one.  It has a full Android Market already built in, and Amazon Kindle as well.  Connects to GMAIL, YAHOO MAIL and FACEBOOK.  Also I have downloaded Google Earth and already came with Google Maps and GPS.  It has a voice recognition device to let you browse the internet with your own  voice.  Downloaded Orbitz, Kayak,  Hotels.com, Amazon, Wikepidia and many more useful gadgets.  This original older version of the Lepan Android 2.2 Tablet, is a really little jewel.  If you are like me and will use it only for mundane entertainment, you will not be disappointed  with it.  On the other end, if you need a school or college type of Tablet device,  I am afraid you will have to look into higher priced Tablets like the Samsung or Ipad.  Better yet,  at that point, I would get a small 12\" Laptop that will work better than any high priced Tablets, and would be much cheaper as well.  But again, if you like me want something to entertain you on the go....You will be very pleased with this great Tablet.  You will not go wrong.  BTW....When the Tablet is fully charged....It will last for about 8hrs.  I think for $130 you could not buy a better Tablet out there....I hope the rating of this tablet has helped you decide......."}

However, recently while traveling on small prop-jets, I have found that even my 12\" Asus netbook is too big for effective use and my N8 is too small for reading eBooks and watching videos. So I asked my wife for the LePan TC970 as a Christmas gift. Has true Google App. Market. Most downloaded apps work without problem. Has built-in wireless 'N' so wifi is fast. Works with the latest version of Skype including video.\nSo far, I have been more than happy.\nPROS: Amazing price ($179 through Amazon). Great screen display and resolution (1024x768) for full web-pages, photos and videos. Reasonable sound for such a small device. Includes GPS and bluetooth not often found on lower-end devices. Relatively quick and responsive. Capacitive screen works as expected.\nCONS: Has trouble playing some video file formats. Can not be upgraded beyond Android 2.2 (froyo). Relatively small user base means lack of support compared to other major brands. Skype video is quirky and poor quality.\n\nAll-in-all, I have to say that this was a great purchase and the LePan TC970 has become my device of choice when I just need to surf, email or play recreationally."}

The android market has worked well and  though some apps haven't been compatible with it, he's found many he likes. The size and picture quality are great. He's really enjoying it and I feel like I made a good choice for his gift!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "First I must say the build quality is impressive as others have noted. It seems many reviewers are first time tablet users, so I also feel it's important to mention that I am tech savvy, and I have used a wide variety of tablets and smartphones.\nThe Le Pan had intriguing specs and good reviews and is at a price point that android tablets will be most competitive against the ipad elite. But, I'll boil this down...\n\n1) It is good for what you pay - great screen, nice looking body, easily handles gmail and simple web browsing... Does well with angry birds and the like... But nothing more video-intensive\n\n2) LAG - video playback is a struggle, simply moving around in android has noticeable delay at times - just sliding around using multitouch has a distinct lag compared to my touchpad and direct comparisons of youtube and flash playback were very blocky and disappointing\n\n3) Support - several reviewers stated positive comments about le pan support... Le Pan was completely unresponsive to all 5 of my emails with simple questions when I was deciding whether or not to buy and no one was available to answer the phone the 6-7 different times I called over a 3 week period. I am not at all impressed.\n\n4) I returned the TC 970, it's just not up to par. The Le Pan II has impressive specs and could potentially perform nearly as well as my touchpad, but the total unresponsiveness of the company would keep me from buying.  Even though the HP touchpad is defunct, you can still always reach a support person."}

The android software works really well, but occasionally it will freeze up.  If you have patience and wait, it will get back on track quickly.  It's only done this to me a few times, and it was right after I downloaded a bigger app.  The 2 mp camera on the front gives a high quality picture. The speakers are surprisingly good quality and give a good loud sound.  It has a 30 pin plug, the exact same as an Apple product.  Optional upgrade up to 32 gbs of memory via micro SD.\n\nAll in all, you get the best bang for your buck out of this tablet.  It's no Apple iPad, but you get what you need and more.

You can't beat the price at around $200 it is a good bargain.  I had it for a couple of weeks now and it does everything I expected it to do and it came with Google Market which is a plus.  Everything you would want with an Android tablet especially if you don't want to shell out over twice as much for an iPad.  Browsing is rather snappy and overall a pretty fast device.\n\nCons:\n\nCamera isn't that great but don't really use it anyway. I lost the network twice and had to reboot but don't know whether it was my home router/service or the device.  It saw the network but wasn't connecting so I am not sure where the problem originated.  If you are gaming, the home and back buttons can get in the way when playing sideways.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI would buy this again with out a doubt.\n\n**************************************************************************\nHere is my review after owning for a few months: The wireless on the device is definitely suspect.  It won't connect most of the time.  I have tried everything.  Now the power button doesn't work.  I have to plug the device into the wall or eject and insert the memory card to get the device to turn on.  I have tried to find out what I could on the warranty but no luck.  Do not buy this product until they work out the bugs and quality issues."}

I have tried the Ipad2, Toshiba Thrive, Acer, Hp Tochpad.  The android tablets all had problems with the 3.0 os and the hp became a 99 toy...not bad.  The ipad2 was returned due not being able to use flash...but it basically was the best of the bunch.  This little android is pretty close to the ipad 2 and actually better due to price.  If you can live with the idea of not having the latest os, its a keeper.  The battery life has been nothing but amazing.  Yesterday, I had this with me on a day trip and had on from 6am to midnite when I got home and battery life was at 62%.  That was after having my grandson using the tablet for angry birds non stop for 3 hrs, connected to wifi all day while my wife shopped, and then watching a movie on the drive back home.  Not sure why some people complained about the power button, I have found it pretty easy to turn on and off.  I am still using my tablet today without charging yet, and battery life is still at 55%.  The apps are super smooth.  You tube videos seem to run fine, I've had a couple lag a little but nothing I can't live with.  I haven't tried to tether to my iphone yet but the bluetooth worked fine in my auto to play my music.  I also downloaded a printer app to be able to send online docs to the printer. The more I use it, the more I forget why I wanted the new os system anyway.  When u connect to the pc, file transfers are a breeze.\nAlso, I have found a few bluetooth apps that to do wireless file transfers but have not had a chance to try them out.  I did use the skype video calling with no problem...no rear camera, but are u really gonna use this for picture taking?"}

However, I thought to myself that these are probably just made right across the street from the Chinese company that builds the IPads using the same labor pool.  I've had an IPhone for years and I have to say I like Android better.\n\nThere's been some people who wonder about the lack of being able to upgrade from froyo, but this is really a minor issue.  Is it really that important to you to spend an extra $150+ on an operating system that most people won't know the difference in the upgrade?  I've used IPad's and I've used this Le Pan and I can honestly say that I'm struggling to see how anyone can equate paying the premium for an Apple product now.  Yeah, sure there's a few reviewers with defective TC 970's, but do you honestly think you're immune to getting a lemon if you go with an iPad?  The way I see it, you can purchase three of these to everyone iPad and that's a huge price difference.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're an everyday user, you'll never know what you're missing on an updated operating system-sure tech people could distinguish the nuances (the kindle fire/nook tablet uses a much more restricted OS to put it in prospective.)  And it's CHEAP!  Buy it with average expectations and you'll be blown away."}

Yes, it turns on and opens a home page, but after that it's anybody's guess as to whether it will work or not.  Usually not.  It's a shame, too, because it really does seem to be well-built.

The day we received it we turned it on and was able to look around in for a little bit and before we even got the chance to plug it in and let it charge it froze up.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "First off, I'm sorry but I am not going to shell out $500+ For a tablet computer.  That is the biggest reason I purchased the Le Pan because it was less than half the price.  It is a similar size to the iPad and I like its size compared to the smaller 7 inch tablets.  It feels more substantial and has a solid build quality.  You can  use it to run Netflix, Amazon Prime videos, and it runs just fine on other video sites like Youtube.\n\nThe biggest complaint that I've seen about this tablet is that it is running Android 2.2 (one of the most stable of the Android operating systems) and that it cannot be upgraded.  Initially that worried me too until I started looking at the Android marketplace and found that most Android apps and games will run on Android version 1.x .  I had to think to myself that by the time Android 2.2 becomes outdated, I'll be able to buy another more current tablet again for around $200 or so bucks and still have paid less than $600+ today for a 32gb iPad 2 which will also be obsolete by the time my Le Pan is...hmmm...makes sense to me to own this tablet with an upgraded 32GB mini SD card for under $250 than to pay over double that price for an iPad or any of the other 32 GB Android tablets currently on the market that are priced much higher.\n\nThis tablet easily handles email, video, music , android games, and microsoft office applications with an office app.  I'm even writing this review by speaking it into the android speak to text application.  I do not know of another tablet that can do everything this one can for this low of price and I searched everywhere.\n\nBy the way, it's awesome to have a tablet in standby mode (It can go a couple days in standby before needing recharged) that you can quickly turn on to jump online or check email!  For the money it really is a no-brainer.  If you want to switch out the micro SD card for a larger one,(comes with a small 2GB card)just copy the contents of the 2GB card onto one that is up to 32Gb in size and voilla you're ready to go.\n\nAlso the Targus Truss Leather Carrying Case for Apple iPad works well with the Le Pan if you're looking for a cover that fits well, plus it has a built in stand."}

Ordering was easy and it arrived quickly, in about 2 days. Very impressed with look and feel, speedy and easy to use. I noticed I was not on my laptop as much and the Le Pan was great for Facebook, email, web browsing. Like others I read earlier reviews and was eagerly awaiting the release of ICS, that would round out the rough edges of the Le Pan on Froyo. Very disappointed that it now sounds like this won't be happening.\n\nAfter 3 months of using the tablet daily, on Thanksgiving day the tablet just would not turn on. I opened a ticket on Lepantab.com site and was impressed that support replied in about an hour. After trying their suggestion the Le Pan would still not power on, so the next day I was issued an RMA and had to pack and ship to CA for repair or replacement. Since it was at my expense I picked UPS ground shipping and that took the tablet a week to get back to Le Pan. The same day the broken unit was received they shipped out another tablet. The replacement also took a week via UPS ground. I was lucky that I had backed up my apps about 3 weeks before the crash so in about an hour most everything was back up and running. So far the replacement is running, just as well as the first one. Just waiting for the day it becomes a paper weight again. I hope this happens prior to the one year warranty running out and that Le Pan is still in business. Although if no OS upgrade is offered I think customers will abandon Le Pan and pick a reliable established name brand.\n\nStill a fan of Android and very happy with Froyo on my phone. BTW my phone shipped with Donut, phone company skipped Eclair but did offer the update to Froyo....that is good support and standing behind your customers and products. Maybe Le Pan will at least support it's customers with a update to Honeycomb, the tablet version of Android."}

For business users, this is no good.\n\nThe unit also freezes sometimes. A few times in the middle of a Appl download. I reset to restart and it continued & finish download. A few times in the middle of just using it. Again, for casual use, no problem. I'm not sure if this is inherently an Android 2.2 issue, or a LePan hardware issue.\n\nThey should have just made a button for the RESET switch vs the indented style that requires a sharp object to press.

It even has GPS and it works!  I only have a few minor issues so far. I pulled out the small cover to get to the SD card and couldn't get the cover seated back as securely as I'd like. In addition, be careful that that you actually turn the tablet off when you're done by pressing the On/Off button and it asks you if you want to power off. It seems that it will go into standby mode (you can set the timeout for this) but it looks as if it has turned off.  You have to push the On/Off button to get back in. I drained the battery by not doing this. (At least that's what I think happened.) I also don't know how to block websites that I don't want my children going to. I'm hoping there's a way to do this.\n\nIf you noticed in the section above about other items to purchase, there is a USB keyboard for around $25.  Do Not Buy It!  I ordered it and when it came I noticed that it had a USB-A plug and the Le Pan has a 30-Pin port. (I did hook the keyboard up to my desktop and it didn't work well. See my review for it.) I thought that I might be able to use an adapter or converter to get around this, but I emailed Le Pan just to make sure.  I was extremely impressed that they replied in only 2-hours and politely.  Here is the reply:\n\nUnfortunately, external USB devices are not compatible with the TC970. If you wish to connect external devices, they must be bluetooth ready.  Thank you.\n\nSo, at this time, I am very happy with the tablet and Le Pan's customer service.  Just be careful with accessories."}

I found that it was very quick with my Wifi connection and the pinch and zoom was great because that is what I was used to with my HTC Droid incredible 2 phone and since I no longer had that phone, this was a good substitute. But really? One day after it came it quit? I was so disappointed, I sent it back immediately.\n\nViewing youtube was pixelated at times when using the actual webpage. The youtube app was somewhat, but sometimes in HP, the picture was somewhat distorted where the picture was more elongated instead of sharper.\n\nI must say, I loved the speakers. The speakers were louder than my Gateway computer. It's a shame that the company did not take the time to truly improve on hardware. I think I would have kept it, if the camera was not backwards and the power button was not such a pain to use."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I just got my Le Pan a few days ago and upgraded the firmware via download and instrux on Le Pan's site - very easy process.  This tablet is very zippy, I have run Netflix, YouTube and other videos and so far, flawless and beautiful.  Photos have great color and sparkle.  I do not see anything better on the market as far as screens go, I put in on par with the Ipad screen.  Really, it is that good!.\n\nAs the other reviews state, the touch sensitivity is high, which I like.  Some have complained about it being too sensitive, but I think that is a strength, not a weakness of this tablet.  The sound is fairly good - use headphones/earphone if you want it to sound great.  The size and weight is perfect for me.  Response switching between applications is very good.  I understand it is single core 1Ghz processor, but I have not run into hangs yet. Instead, everything so far is smooth as silk.\n\nThe makers say that it is Android 2.2 with no upgrade path to 4.0, which may be a deal breaker for some, but not for me.  According to the spec requirements of Android 4.0, this tablet falls within parameter of upgrading to 4.0.  Maybe it is just waiting for someone who knows how to create a Le Pan Android 4.0 upgrade if we root our device - hint, hint...  Regardless, for me, 4.0 would be nice, but all of the functionality and performance I currently need in a tablet is here, Flash 11, fluid videos, easily readable full web sites (not confined to mobile sites for view-ability), games -even 3D types, reading apps galore, 9.7\" screen for a price that is the same or less than other 7\" bigger name companies.\n\nThe unit appears very solidly made and it is a pleasure to use. I wish I had found this months ago as it would have saved me a lot of wasted time shopping around. So to sum it all up, knowing that this is Froyo 2.2 based and may not have an upgrade path to 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, if that is ok you, that I would extremely highly recommend this as an excellent tablet for a very good price (I purchased for 199.00).\n\nI think I will be enjoying this for a long while.\n\n***UPDATE *** CAUTION***\nI think I am going to return this unit after all.  I enjoy it and feel a little sad over it, but after I wrote this review, it began to lock up/freeze on me and at one point I had to try to reset it 3x before it would reset and reboot. Even with its many strengths and nice price point, it is not worth the frustration of dealing with that.  It could be signs of more trouble to come and I would hate to have a brick after warranty ends.  I may try again with the Le Pan II when it comes out, but a locking up and freezing tablet just won't do..."}

We did a lot of research and finally figured for the price we would give this one a go, and glad we did. We got it for him for an early christmas present, when it arrived, I being kind of a tech nut, decided I was going to load it with all of the programs from AM that he would use, and we fell in love with it. The screen is huge, and very forgiving in most light as well as viewing angles. The Tab is very easy to use and is very forgiving for people who are not very technical. We were so pleased with the purchase we bought one for ourselves 2 days later. For the price you cannot beat this tab.

However, I had major issues with it dropping the wi-fi signal in my relatively small house after a few lengthy web browsing sessions.  This became a quite a nuisance.\n\nWe attempted connecting the tablet to a portable hot-spot via Bluetooth.  Well, the tablet could/would not connect via Bluetooth (though it has Bluetooth capability.) Also, because it has ONLY A PROPRIETARY USB PORT (not standard), we couldn't link the two manually.\n\nThe tablet doesn't come with any kind of manual that could've possibly explained or helped to resolve some of the issues we were having. As I was looking for a simple tablet that Mom would be able to basically turn on and roll with, calls to to tech support, or endless tinkering/tweaking are NOT desired...so this puppy had to be returned.\n\n*************************************************************************************************\nI purchased this tablet for my mother for Christmas. She's technologically challenged, so I'm setting up everything before it goes under the tree. She'll be able to get started using it the moment the wrapping paper comes off.\n\nI must say, that like most other reviewers, I'm impressed with the quality feel and design of this tablet.  My order arrived promptly and the tablet was already charged enough for me to get to work setting it up and downloading apps immediately!  The display is excellent and it's perfect for mom to see it with or without her reading glasses.\n\nMy only complaint is that the keyboard case that's depicted with this tablet...does not fit and as the tablet has only a proprietary usb accessory port, the keyboard cannot be connected to it anyhow.  I'm not sure how I missed that little kernel of info during my research.\n\nLuckily, I plan to purchase a different kind of tablet for myself, so I'll keep this keyboard/case for that one.\n\nAll in all, this is a terrific tablet for the price.  I'll update this review once mom's had a chance to weigh in with her \"novice's\" viewpoint."}

My cousin like it for basic use like internet, e mail, youtube, etc. The gaming mode is nice and smooth.

It is great for online banking, shopping, games and pretty much anything you can think of. As others have said this product worked great right out of the box. I didn't even have to charge it for a few hours. I am a student, so i have taken this tablet to school. Every wifi i have connected it with so far has given me zero problems. The only problems i have had, or not even really large issues at all  are that the tanlet only comes with one wall charger, the fingerprints are definitely annoying(although i am going to order the screen protector today for this tablet, if you do not like an excessive amount of fingerprints then ordering the screen protector is a must for you, ive also read very good reviews about the screen protector specifically made for this tablet), and the tanlet does not have a usb port. Although this is not a bigissue at all, because i learned that my ipod usb cord works perfectly with this tablet. I wanted to order the leather case with the keyboard that amazon recommends buying for this tablet, but i believe the keyboard is only compatible with a usb port. Although it should work with the ipod cord, so i may order that soon as well. Overall, the tablet is a great product and i only paid 168 for it after signing up for an amazon credit card i got 30 dollars off of the sale price. What a steal!

It feels very solid. I downloaded apps in 5 seconds. There is a problem with the fingerprints - I had heard others say it was a fingerprint magnet in the reviews I read, but I thought they were nitpicking. Honestly, it's a problem. You will want a screen cover on this when you take it from the box...the fingerprints are really, really bad.\n\nThe display is visually striking. The web pages are fast. HD video clear as day. The built in speakers are...meh. Ive heard a lot worse, but we all knew they wouldn't be Bose. The games are smooth. There are a bunch of apps pre-loaded but if you aren't gonna head straight to the app store when you open your new tab, why buy one? I got apps from Android Market, Amazon, and a wifi signal app from a friend. Comixology - the comics and graphic novels look better than print does. Kindle app worked straight-away, like everything else.\n\nas for cons...the buttons on the front have a feature where they light up when you press them. But,it would have been better if they either lit always, or lit up when the light sensor kicks in at a certain dimness or something...cause really, I can be laying in the dark reading the kindle before bed, and I can't see the 'back' or 'home' buttons...until after I press one...which doesn't help much; I need to see a button before I press it, not after. (Thats probably my biggest complaint about the whole device, honestly.)\n\nThere's not an HDMI-out. I don't need one in any way - my home theater system runs from a PC server anyway, so if I did have a file on this and I wanted it on the big screen, I could get it there without an HDMI. And I don't need to use mine for any presentations or anything, but I know some people like and use this feature. So, not a con for me, but maybe for others.\n\nI would have preferred a USB port, though I haven't really needed one of those either.\n\nAnd finally, there is a lack of really good cases. It physically fits into most ipad cases, though those cases are not made for this thing. The ports are either covered up, or the buttons on the front are, or the camera & light sensors are. , but it is a gripe I have. Le Pan has some linked on their site, but I don't find them ideal.\n\nAll in all, the thing is sharp, solid, pretty damn fast, and capable of everything I've asked of it. If there's a better tab at even close to a similar price point, I would love to know of it.\n\nI'm extremely pleased."}

TO SAVE YOU FROM BUYING THIS! Basically, this product is so out of date, there is NO reason to buy it.. well.. for $50, maybe, but even then I would hesitate. The reasons are as follows:\n\n1) Terrible support - disappearing support options!  Terrible support website. I am disappointed in LePan.\n2) No firmware updates, will not run many new apps.\n3) Slow (by today's measure) hardware, quirky problems (definitely related to no updates to the firmware)\n\nWhile I am not disappointed in my original purchase (I got my value for the money, I feel) I would definitely not buy this TODAY, for, say, more than $50, and only if I had a specific purpose for it. Screen size and battery life are a big plus, but this product was basically ABANDONED by the manufacturer from birth. For the same reason, I would NOT buy, NOR recommend, another Le Pan. Top end competition products have come down in price, and Le Pan no longer holds enough of a price advantage to justify buying their products.\n\n-------------------End of Update---------------\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI am typing this review on the Lepan. It is a very usable product and i expect to use my laptop a lot less.\n\nFor $200 nothing can touch this. You can buy 2 of these for the price of 1 competing brand unit, and get near 100% same functionality.\n\nWe bought two of these for that reason.\n\nFirst, some big pluses. Huge, beautiful capacitive screen with nearly unlimited view angle. Amazing battery life. Solid look and feel, nothing cheap about the build. Proven OS with plenty of market apps.\nCan be rooted and customized. WIFI..GPS.. BLUETOOTH...\n\nSome minuses. Note that i did not even take a star off for these. No real dedicated accesories such as cases etc...just generic stuff. No USB port..just a propiertary cable to charge or hook up to Pc.. le pan sacrifices some things to keep the price low. Looks like they made the right choice what to sacrifice though.\n\nThe only issue i had was i at first could not connect to a wireless router. If you have a N router and having connectivity issues, try taking router speed down to 54 mbps..that solved the problem. Most routers should not be affected though."}

I am so happy to have found LePan. I have an Android phone, so for me, it was simple to use.

The company posted instructions & on the first day, they were very confusing, but they have since updated them & seems to be easier than I thought.

Also made 2 \"cases\" after registering my tablet on their website & have very quick responses from them (both were also reason I called). I haven't tried skype yet, but there are plenty of others that have given advice on how to fix that problem.

I even downloaded a texting app & can text from it, instead of using my phone!\n\nI didn't give it 5 stars because of the older OS, difficulty updating the firmware & the freezing. I would have given it 4.5, but that wasn't an option.\n\nI'm glad I got it before they were out of stock!

I would recommend that you look else where for a different tablet that has good customer support and stands behind their products, Le Pan is just not such a company.\n\n12/7/11 - Updated review;\n\nWhile I still have not had any contact from the manufacture I did in fact find the cause of the problem. It seems that if I remove the SD card prior to the initial boot up it will boot just fine. I performed all the uddates at that time, shut down the device, reinstalled the SD card and rebooted. Everything seems to work fine now. Great little tablet. While it wint replace a higher priced tablet with more memory of faster cpu, for the money it is a great little tablet. Still not crazy about the lack of customer support, however as for the tablet I highly recommend it. I have had it working for 5 days now without a single problem. I have also changed the rating fron 1 to 4 stars. My only complaint would be with the lack of customer support, not the device.\n\n12/22/11 - Final updated review;\n\nStill no contact from manufacture. Suppose they are very busy. In any case the tablet continues to freeze every 20 - 35 minutes. I have installed the firmware update, tried various memory manager apps and even restored tablet to factory presets. Even with no other apps loaded other than what the tablet came with, it still continues to freeze. This seems to be a known issue on the internet. Some, and I mean \"some\" people have had good luck with this tablet. Most others end up returning it or try to get customer support. I personally would not recommend this tablet to anyone. As for customer support, I have read some say they get good support while others feel support for Le Pan is nonexistent. I can't say one way or the other as I was never able to get customer support to help me. Just understand that if you do decide to purchase this tablet you will be taking the risk of ending up with a substandard tablet and no support. Do your homework first, you'll be glad you did."}

Granted it only runs froyo, but I didn't get this tablet to replace my netbook.  I bought it for ereading, ecomics, and for casual web browsing.  The screen is vivid, it plays videos well, and it feels well built.  My only con is the froyo os, but it's a very small con.  If you're on the fence because there is no store in your area that carries this tablet so you can get a \"hands on\" experince, try not to fret.  This tablet is WELL worth the money,  and as long as you know what a tablet can and cannot do you will be pleasntly surprised with the capabilities of the Le Pan TC 970."}

This is quote from one of the reviews of this case.  \"Hot air solves the problem quite easily.\nTake a hair blowdryer and heat up the latches until they are pliable. This will make it easy to move the latches to the desired position to latch on to the TouchPad securely. It takes about 10 minutes with heating at regular intervals and manipulating to latches to fit perfectly. But after you are satisfied with the positions and put the TouchPad back in, you will be amazed at how perfectly and securely it fits.\""}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I spent weeks trying to decide on a tablet for myself and decided that I wouldn't spend more than $300 (sorry Apple, too rich for my blood).  I was suprised at how many decent option were out there in my price range, but all those that I played with just seemed like the hardware couldn't keep up with the OS.  I stumbled across this tablet on Amazon and was amazed at how well it was being reviewed by people who would know a decent tablet.  I finally decided to pull the trigger after watching a professional review video.  It seemed so snappy and transitions were smooth.  I've had the tablet now for 3 days and I'm very satisfied with my purchase and amazed I got it for less than $200.  Other than a couple of random freezes that required a reset (which was quick and painless) it has lived up to everything I had hoped.\n\nThis does not feel like a sub $200 tablet.  I went and played with a lot of low-end Android tablets in department stores around town and they all felt like cheap, plastic toys.  This thing is incredibly solid with no creaking, twisting, etc.  The chrome end pieces give it a very high quality feel and the back panel texture is very nice to hold.  I've been able to find every app that I was looking for in the market and had no problems installing any of them.  The new \"World of Goo\" on the Market runs silky smooth and is a better playing experience than on my Wii.  I was worried about finding a case for this since there isn't much on the manufacturers website, but after reading a few other reviews, I tried a Targus Zierra leather portfolio for the original iPad and while it's not a perfect fit, it's pretty close and all ports, buttons, etc are left exposed and accessible.\n\nI am seriously considering buying another one of these so that my kids will stop asking to play with mine, but the problem is that the cat is out of the bag and every place I've looked is now showing out of stock.  My advice, if you're like me and don't have the money or the coolness to get an iPad, find a way to track one of these down."}

Firefox seems to have a problem with displaying flash media and I could not get their sync feature to work across my tablet to PC. Another good browser is Dolphin. The browser that comes with the system is not feature-rich and I would not use it.\n3)WIFI has been flawless and yes the signal bars don't seem to always stay at max but performance does not appear to suffer.\n4) Works well with Google services as others have said and its easy to integrate my Yahoo mail as well.\n5) I used the CrazyOndigital case for iPad and it works well for $13.\n\nIn summary, device works well without a lot of setup and the value/performance is the best in the marketplace right now @ $199, IMO."}

The outside is nicely built and I like the design.  But I am new to Android and don't know how to verify the processor speed and the RAM memory like people do on Windows.  I suspect that the processor speed and the RAM memory is not what they claim, particularly the RAM.  I feel it is very slow when switching between applications.  I also believe the video card or video chip inside the pad is slow or of poor quality.  It claims that the resolution is 1024X768, but when I play videos of that size, it is slow and the picture is lagging behind the sound, in other words, I hear the sound first and movement of a person's mouth does not match the sound.  I know you will think that the video may not be good quality, or wrong format.  I can tell you I am an expert on converting videos and I can play the same video with no problem on ViewSonic, although I also returned that one for other reasons:)  Also, when I try to fastforward a movie, it will not fastforward, but pause for some time before getting to the place I want it to play, then, the lagging between the picture and the sound is even worse.  That is why I believe the processor and the video chip speed is not there to support 1024X768.  I was willing to pay for this Le Pan basically because I like the size, the processor speed, and the RAM (claimed to be 512MB).  I bought a cheap 7 inch pad in China (350 Chinese Yuan=$55-60USD) with a slower processor and 256MB RAM, but it played the videos much more smoothly than this Le Pan.  In my opinion it is worth $150 maybe even less than that.  I don't want to buy it unless they improve the hardware or reduce the price.  Also, I forgot to mention that on the upper left corner of the screen there is bleeding white edge when the screen is dark during a movie playing.  Sorry, I cannot say lots of good things about this Le Pan.  Maybe I just had bad luck.\n\nI do want to say that I like Amazon.  I filed return and they sent me the UPS return label immediately and gave credit back to my credit card even before they received the return.  Maybe it is because I have been a good customer:) I don't have worries ordering at Amazon."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I couldn't wait to get home so I could finally try the Le Pan TC 970 tablet in person. After reading the other reviews here on Amazon and on other places online, I was so excited that I skipped dinner and tested the Le Pan immediately. This would have been my first Android device. I already have a desktop PC, a Macbook, iPhone, the Kindles, but I love those widgets on the home screens of Android running devices. Aside from the relatively low price, I also like the size of the Le Pan compared to the other Android tablets, specifically for pdf files. The ability to comfortably read and annotate pdf files is my main purpose for buying a tablet.\n\nAnyway, after configuring with my WiFi, I finally got the Le Pan hooked up to my home network. The thing I noticed, though, was that even though I was two feet from my router, the signal strength icon was at the lowest apex level on the Le Pan. The device also kept disconnecting, so I had to wait for the Le Pan to scan and reconnect to my network, which was very slow and super annoying, of course, but I thought maybe it was just my inexperience with the Android system. I went to the Le Pan website using my Macbook, which was in my room, maybe 50 feet away, to download the user's manual to see if I was doing anything wrong.  The signal strength icon on my Macbook was at full strength, even though it's far from the router compared to the Le Pan.  After an hour of connecting/disconnecting, the Le Pan frooze, so I had to get a paper clip to press the reset button.  After resetting, web surfing was still so sluggish.  At this point the battery was almost empty, so I charged it.  While it was charging, it turns out that you could not use the Le Pan.  After reading the manual again, it seems you could NOT use the device during the first charge.  So I went to bed and let it charge overnight, hoping for better performance in the morning.  Again, web surfing was so sluggish!  Also it kept crashing and just totally died - the screen went all black, even though I had laid it down and didn't touch the power button. I thought maybe using apps instead would be easier and faster, but the results were just as bad. I tried logging in to the Facebook and Kindle apps, but got the \"failed\" and \"try again later\" messages over and over. When a website did load successfully, the touch screen was frequently inaccurate - it kept opening the link next to the one I wanted to open.  I could not endure any more torture and had to repack it to return the device as soon as the post office reopens after Thanksgiving. I didn't even bother to see if I could use the Le Pan during the succeeding charges or how my pdf files would look on it.\n\nI didn't have any problems with the power button as some of the other users. I thought it was odd, though, that there were already bookmarks on the browser when I didn't bookmark any websites. I do agree that the usb end does NOT insert flush with the power adapter, which was weird and emblematic of the cheapness of this product."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "The reviews of this tablet list so many positive reactions.  I concur with all of them.  The tablet is very nicely done for the cost.  The manufacturer has placed plenty of thought into the construction, components, screen, and other decision making factors involved in developing this product.  Writing another positive review seems redundant, though my excitement really wants to vent.\n\nHere are the questions and concerns I had when ordering, hoping they will answer your questions too.\n\n1. The tablet took only four days to get here, and yes I ordered during the holidays (week before thanksgiving to be exact).\n2. The tablet fits nicely into cases designed for the first generation iPads, take your pick on what you like. I took it down to Best-Buy to try it out and see what it fits in.  The cases designed for the older iPads seemed to be perfect.\n3. Order the screen protector by searching for: POSRUS Antiglare Antifingerprint Screen Protector for Le Pan TC 970, they have it here on Amazon.  It fits perfect.\n4. It works on the WiFi in my home anywhere in the house, the garage, and on the front terraces. Using a cheap Belkin N router and access point I picked up for less than 40 dollars. I've heard that the devices have better range on Infrastructure networks as opposed to ad-hoc networks, so this might make a difference in the range.  It also works at the McDonald's Wifi, and Starbucks WiFi at the BN bookstore by my house without any problems at all.\n5. The viewing ratio is perfect for reading books and viewing PDF's.  I am a student, and I read lots of textbooks.  It does a great job with this.  I almost don't want to give it to my son now for Christmas.  Might have to order another one for Dad.\n6. Yes the screen is a capacitive multi-touch screen.  It works great, and it is very responsive, actually impressive.  It is also very accurate.  The resistive screen on other tablets I've used I felt lucky if I was even close to typing what I wanted.\n\nIt meets all my expectations, even after ordering it and searching for the couple days afterward for a better deal, I could not find one with this multi-touch screen and viewing ratio near the price I was willing to pay, which was under $225 ($250 including S&H).\n\nStudent Note:  If you are thinking of getting this for reading textbooks, it does work great, the 4:3 ratio is better than the widescreen.  It is not very heavy to hold for hours of homework reading, and I recommend getting a small arrowhead type stand (around $15 anywhere including Amazon and Wal-Mart) as it is perfect sitting next to the computer monitor while working on homework.\n\nNote about Manufacturer:  The manufacturer lists multiple ways to get hold of them, they answer emails and questions very promptly, and are genuinely eager to help.\n\nNote about Skype:  The microphone works, and so does the chat and screen share.  Video does not because of a Skype limitation with Android 2.2.  However there are alternatives that do work.  (oovoo and fring I've been told work, but I have not tried them yet.) !!! Update on Skype !!! Try the new Skype download, it was supposed to fix this limitation with the OS, I already got my Skype working with a modified version.  Search for Modified Skype for Android Froyo and the tablet name, you'll find the download :)\n\nSuggestions:  Order a 32gb Micro SD card with it.  (32 is the max it takes, I am sure a 16 or 8 would be fine too...)\n\nI searched for one whole week on so many websites I went blind, with my wife glaring at me for the amount of time I spent searching.  This was a great deal, and now having received the tablet (while still searching online at others waiting for it to arrive), I truly feel it was the right and best purchase for me, or um my son's Christmas present... going to have to order another one.\n\nUPDATE AFTER USING A LOT! 11/30/2011\nThe one thing that popped up after some heavy use with the tablet over this past week and playing around with all that Android has to offer... this tablet does not have a USB port.  I was able to order an adapter though for the charger cable that is USB female to female, and I will try that out when it gets here.  The power cable has a standard size USB end on one end, and a proprietary connector for charging on the other end, my hope is that with the adapter, I can add that little functionality to it.  The ability to use the USB to play movies would be an outstanding bonus, taking that little micro SD card in and out is just not as easy as USB.  Even with that little need, I am still 100% satisfied about the product."}

I upgraded to the Le Pan II for amazon prime streaming (which apparently works on both now).  In general the Le Pan II is worth the extra money for newer and stronger capabilities (more online video options in general and newer browser with TABS!).  However, for eReading and basic web surfing the Le Pan I will work for an average user.  If you want higher power for more techie oriented things, I recommend the Le Pan II.  That is if you can find one, most places are sold out and with good reason.\n\nMy parents (not technie inclined) love theirs and now use them in daily life.  My dad surfs the web quickly and easily from his recliner, and my mom uses hers as basically a large Ipod touch for music and games.  They use them daily and have no complaints.  I do not think they would get any more out of an upgrade to the Le Pan II.\n\nI have adapted to my Le Pan II and sadly cannot live without it any more (I could settle with Le Pan I and live).  I use it at all hours of the day to control other devices, surf the web, check email (all can be done just as well from Le Pan I).  The added power of the tablet and browser compared to the Le Pan I was well worth it for me.  I use my computer a lot, and thanks to my Le Pan II there are now days I simply do not turn on my computer at all.\n\nIf web browsing and email (not a lot of streaming video embedded in pages) is your main focus, the Le Pan I will work fine for your purpose.\n\nIf accessing all the techie parts of the internet with 6 tabs in your browser is how you surf the web, get the Le Pan II.\n\nI understand Netflix works on both with the app for those interested.  The battery life is slightly better on the Le Pan I (half the power so no surprise).  I like the default keyboard on the Le Pan II better, but you can get other keyboards.  I can now type about 70 words per minute on my Le Pan II and it keeps up, the Le Pan I should be able to match that.  In either case both are really great tablets.\n\n***Original review:\n\nI shall try to avoid repeating what others have put into reviews, and try to be brief despite much praise.  First to explain my culmination comment, I have been searching for a viable tablet to watch online videos, read webpages/email comfortably, and as a small portable media player.  This tablet does all of these things acceptably well or in exemplary fashion, and met my final criterion of not being retardedly expensive.  I picked up a few of the really cheap 7\" tablets.  They did okay, but lacked web video support.  They make good supplemental media players though.  I saw this tablet, and was wary given the unknown name.  However, I took the chance and am very happy I did.  I showed my family, and have now had to get one for my father and brother, too.\n\nThere are a few notes I would give on top of the given info in other reviews, I agree with pretty much every positive thing said in the other reviews.  This tablet is wonderful, and at an excellent price, but there are a few caveats I have noticed.  These are in no way deal breakers for me given that other tablets of similar quality cost twice as much.\n\nNot all online video works, the single core limits the video capacity on non-'mobile optimised' videos.  It usually does fine for the most part on short videos (~10 min or less) but not so well on longer ones.  The videos optimised for mobile play just fine, and I have had no trouble with youtube etc.  The dual core tablets seem to do this fine, but it limits little compared to the price.\n\n**Apparently no longer the case see video update**  Tying into the last point it does not stream video from Amazon.com well.  My connection should be fine, but the attempts I have made at watching amazon prime streaming video has been unwatchable from moment one, I hope amazon gets mobile support.  They needn't sell me a kindle fire at a loss by supporting general mobile devices, and it would increase my video rentals.\n\nThe speakers are actually pretty good for portable devices (almost no portable speakers have good bass, but this is certainly not 'tinny').  A good pair of headphones is a must for audio excellence on a portable device.  I have noted that the sound through my headphones, while certainly above average, is not as good as some other devices (I listen to opera, and you can really tell differences).\n\nMy Le Pan has been very stable, I have had it 3 weeks and only had to reset it once.\n\nI think that is most of the information I have that did not show up in other reviews.  If I think of anything else I shall update this.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are looking for a great price on a far better than average tablet: get this product.  If you are looking for top shelf, be ready to pay twice this amount or more.\n\n**Update**  After 2 months of continual use, my tablet ran into a booting issue.  I sent an email Friday night of Christmas weekend.  The offices were closed until Tuesday (which I pretty much expected).  By 9am PST I received a response email instructing me how to open a ticket so that I could get tech support.  I did so, had a few back and forth comments to go through tech support steps, and by Tuesday evening I had the information I needed to restore my tablet to perfect function.  I am now enjoying my tablet once more.  I got so addicted to this thing that I was very eager indeed to get it back up and running.  The other TC970 tablets I got for my father and brother are still running perfectly.  I am excited about the upcoming Le Pan II to be released in early January.\n\nupdate tl;dr  I needed tech support and got it in a professional and expedient fashion, my experience with company interaction has been emphatically positive."}

It does not support Android past 2.2.  This creates other limitations.\n\n2. Plan on buying a Map/GPS App if you want to use this feature in situations where wifi is not available.\n\n4. The button that locks the display orientation, instead flips it back to a landscape orientation and then locks it.\n\n5. The screen blanking function only allows choices from 30 second to 30 minutes, there is no disable. Unlocking takes time, so if you want to use it as a music stand, you probably do not want to set a password or pin to protect it.\n\nAfter the latest software update, all of the above seem to still apply.  But given the price, it can be a good deal."}

I ran across this and read the reveiws and beleived what I read and glad I did.\nOnce you open the box and read the very short instructions your in business. I had trouble down loading music until I did the smart thing, got the neighbors 15 yr old to show me what to do. Plug in to my laptop and downloaded pictures and music. GREAT\nI added a few apps and was ready to fly away.\nNow for a little advice, you can buy a Ipad2 leather cover that fits the le pan very well, go to ebay and order the screen protector made for the Le Pan ($7.50) takes care of the finger prints and glare.\nShort falls, I wish it had USB connections, the GPS is not a GPS it has Google Maps and if you are in a WI-FI area it will show you where you are at get out of WI-FI and you just have the map. If anyone has had better luck please put it online.\nThe key board case thats shown with the 16 bit chip in the Amazon page does not fit and has a USB plug.\nThe Le Pan people should put some where more indepth instructions.\nOverall I am very happy with this even though I bought it at the $235. mark and 2 days later price dropped to $198."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "What can you get in a tablet with a $200 budget? You can get your choice of off-brand 7 inch screens with bad reviews and a lot of trouble setting them up. You can get a \"Fire\" with a lot of functionality and good reviews while still being limited to a 7 inch screen. The savvy consumer, however, can take a little more time in their research and stumble across the Le Pan, as I did.\n\nI was looking for a little bit of everything on a budget. I wanted to have a backup computer just in case my laptop left me stranded. Having 4 home businesses I really shouldn't limit myself to just one computer and smart phone. I also wanted something for my girls to play all their favorite games on so I could have my phone back. We're already comfortable with Android OS so I wanted to stick with it and keep things simple. I was having some heartburn over purchasing anything with a 7\" screen so I kept looking. When I found the Le Pan I knew it would fit my needs perfectly. Initially it was priced at about $250 but something told me that I needed to wait for the price to drop. Earlier this week the price dropped and I grabbed it straight through Amazon!\n\nI just received it yesterday- love that quick shipping! It worked great right out of the box. I plugged it in and immediately got it hooked up to my wifi with ease. I think it helps if you already have a Google account (gmail). As soon as I was online I opened the Android Market and started downloading our favorite Apps. Seriously- this thing is ready to work for you right out of the box! It's highly intuitive so you don't have to worry about being a guru to figure it out. There are also some on-screen tutorials and prompters if you need them. Within minutes my girls were playing games and I had a big smile on my face. I knew I made the right decision getting the Le Pan.\n\nLet me tell you this thing is sexy! So sleek and thin, it's just pretty to look at. The screen clarity is phenomenal and the responsiveness is great. I played around with the settings last night and was pleased with the options I have to personalize it. It finally got a chance to fully charge overnight and we've been enjoying Angry Birds all morning before switching over to the more adult activities of testing the browser and checking email. Now that I know it's a winner, I'll look for a good protective case and screen protector. As much as I would prefer to show off her beauty, I have to protect her from the girls (3 & 4 yrs old).\n\nBottom line: I highly recommend the Le Pan and can't imagine having gotten better value for my money. If I had $200 to spend on everyone on my Christmas list, they would all get one!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "Since I've started searching for an Android tablet at about the time the XOOM came out. I have asked myself one question. If the iPad is the industry standard with a 9.7 inch screen, 4:3 ratio(Full Screen), why in the world would the vast majority of Android tablets introduced as 10 inchers be in a 16:9 widescreen ratio? Why is this important? Because although nice to view in landscape mode, they are awkward to view in portrait mode (at best). Whereas, a screen with the same size as the iPad (9.7 inch, 4:3 ratio), is pleasant to view in both angles. This is where the Le Pan tc970 comes in. It is the perfect screen size to surf the web and read eBooks in. Here are a few pro's and cons:\n\nPros: Screen Size, Quality, and Ratio\nAndroid 2.2\nFits with most Ipad 1st Generation Cases\n\nTry this Case:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Targus-Truss-Case-Stand-for-Apple-iPad-16GB-32GB-64GB-WiFi-3G-iPad-2-THZ06103US-Black-Blue/dp/B004TLH6IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Targus Truss Case/Stand for Apple iPad 16GB, 32GB, 64GB WiFi + 3G, iPad 2 THZ06103US (Black/Blue)</a>\n\nLe Pan has solid Support\n\nCons: No upgrade to ICS 4.0\nAndroid 2.2\nScreen Resolution - (Everything looks big(Sort of like staring at your Android Phone, But Magnified)\nNo access to Android ADB USB Drivers to access via ADB, and try rooting.\nNo widely available root method.\n\nAndroid 2.2 is a very stable OS, and you can tell they really optimized it for this hardware. The screen is very snappy and responsive unlike any other Android tablet out there that I have tried out. Honeycomb stinks in my opinion anyhow. Google actually admitted that it was rushed out as a stop gap to ICS 4.0 anyhow. So, I'll take 2.2/2.3 over Honeycomb on a tablet. The argument many make is 2.2 was not designed for tablets. It's alot snappier and smooth than 3. X Honeycomb though.\n\nSo, I am not too sure why most Android tablet vendors put out the wide screen tablets, but they should probably try taking a cue from the iPad and offer the 4:3 9.7 inch screen. So far, most obscure Chinese tablets you see on ebay with this size are trash. This Le Pan is a rare good one. Another good one that seems to be on the way is made my arnova, that is yet to be released called the Arnova 9 G2.\n\nBut, I highly reccomend it. Especially at the current price of $200. If the Android community were to jump on this device and root it, the possibilities would be endless."}

At 199 I just couldn't resist buying this tablet because I have been looking for one for quite awhile. So far my experience has been great. It is quick and I haven't found any apps that don't work perfectly. The biggest concern I have is the 30 pin connector. It is physically the same as an apple connector but I don't have an apple connector around to find out if it will charge it.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "The first one I ordered lost the ability to connect to Wi-Fi after about a week.  Le Pan customer service was very responsive (within a few hours), but when their suggestions did not solve my problem, I decided to return it with the intent to purchase something different.  After a week or two, because of such stellar reviews, I decided to take a chance and purchased another Le Pan.  It has performed well enough for my expectations.  My impressions are as follows:\n\nIt connected easily to my Wi-Fi network and two other locations, but based on the connectivity indicator on the tablet, the adapter seems to be weaker than what is found in my laptop or phone. However, this does not seem to affect performance.\nThe OS is intuitive and familiar (I have an EVO 4G) and it is typical of what you would expect of an Android device.  The user manual is located in the pre-installed file explorer if needed.\nIt feels solid in the hands and the chrome accents are attractive.  I read some complaints about the power button, but I have had no issues with it.\nThe screen is a comfortable size (I think 7 inches is too small) and colors are vibrant.  Touch sensitivity is excellent, I have experienced no lags or lock-ups when using the screen.\nWeb browsing is zippy, I am using Dolphin HD and even pages running Flash render pretty quickly.\nI have used Bluetooth to transfer music and files from my phone and computer to the tablet and all devices were paired easily and connectivity was fine.\nSpeaker sound is not crystal clear when at a high volume, but it is not terrible.\nI downloaded Mobo Video Player and it works well. I was able to USB transfer movies I had on my computer with no problems (one of the main reasons I wanted a tablet) and they play well, as do YouTube, HBO GO, and Crackle.\nThe screen and body becomes loaded with fingerprints after light use so a case and screen protector is needed.\nGPS does work, but I experienced some lag even on a clear day.  It always seemed to be a turn behind.\nI have had to perform a reset, but I am not sure if there was a cause or just a random occurrence.\n\nI have been using it for a little over a week and although I have had a couple of issues, they have not been significant enough to not recommend this tablet.  However, if you desire the latest software or are looking for something close to a laptop replacement, this is probably not the one.  I was looking for a device to perform simple tasks (music, movies, and web browsing) and offer me portability, and this has been a decent choice.  It is an especially great buy at the current price of less than $200."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I got this tablet back in September and was initially fairly impressed. It looked pretty good, seemed to have a good build quality, had fairly fluid graphics and ran on Android. Plus, even though it was inexpensive, its memory was expandable to 32GB through the micro SD. I talked with their customer service folks before buying, and they explained that although the camera wouldn't actually work with video chat for the time-being, when the new Android OS (4.0) came out it would be able to [Note: I've since been corrected that there is other software and other ways of doing video chat]. As I started to use it I realized that Android 2.2 (aka froyo) is really mainly designed for cell-phones rather than tablets. It doesn't use the screen space very well, doesn't support split pane gmail, and is incompatible with a number of apps you'd would hope to be able to use on your tablet (although I managed to find others that still did most of what I was looking for, it was a pain--particularly given that it was a new product). I also noticed that although my wifi connection was fairly stable at home, it was extremely unstable with my school's enterprise wifi network--a big deal for me since I had bought it mainly for school use. Still, I figured that as soon as I would be able to upgrade to Android 4.0 (ice cream sandwich), the rest of its functionality would be restored.\n\nGoogle released the source code for Android 4.0 (ICS) 2 days ago (Monday 11/14/11). I called Le Pan about the wifi issue today and confirmed that it was probably because of the old OS. I asked when I'd be able to upgrade the OS, and they said that their engineering folks were now saying it would be impossible to upgrade, but that they'd be coming out with a new tablet next year that would support it. I would be stuck with my current OS. I explained how limited the functionality was and how I wouldn't have bought it if they hadn't reassured me that it would soon have the fully functioning OS and asked for a refund. They said they couldn't offer a refund unless it was broken in some way (as opposed to intrinsically broken). Fortunately, after talking with the folks at Amazon they are refunding it (way to pull through, Amazon!).\n\nI realize that for some of you this wouldn't be a deal-breaker and am giving it two-stars because it does work for some things. But for those hoping for a cheaper (slightly slower) iPad alternative, I'd say this isn't the android you're looking for.\n\n[Note: I realize that I could root it and install a slightly newer OS, but that would void the warranty, and it would ultimately be a dead-end--it would never get to 4.0 or beyond.]"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I bought this tablet with high expectations from the many reviews I read regarding a multitude of tablets.  I would agree that this is a great product for around $200.  It is definitely not an iPad, but I would recommend this product to people who prefer the Android system or are on a budget.  I have an Android phone so I figured this would be a fine operating system.  The Le Pan has the real Android market so that is a major plus.  I had trouble connecting the Le Pan to my Wifi and required Tech Support from my Internet company before being able to use the Le Pan where as I do not experience this with my iPod touch device.  I will say that Le Pan provided me with excellent customer service.  They got back to me the same day and called me even though I contacted them via e-mail.  They helped me the best they could and were willing to provide further assistance if the issue had not turned out to be my Internet provider.  I have had the Le Pan only a few days and already it has frozen a few times and the only way I can fix it is by using a bobby pin to reset the tablet.  I find this a little concerning because its only been a few days whereas my iPod software I rarely encounter freezing in years of ownership.  I have also had an issue with some software regarding books not being available because of the Android operating system.  The tablet does ofter excellent speed, a vibrant screen, and a clean overall look almost exactly as the iPad.  I will say the tablet is quite heavier than I expected but I have a feeling that using a stylus will solve some of the strain.  Overall I would say this a good quality product for the price and the customer service gives the Le Pan extra points.  I hope I continue to enjoy my tablet as much as I have since I bought it.\n\nUpdate:  I have now had my Le Pan for a longer time and it has only got better.  It stopped freezing and now works rather well.  I have had no more issues with it since the first few days."}

And now that Walmart has a price rollback, I made the decision to compliment my smartphone with a tablet. The biggest difference between these two gadgets is the screen size and resolution, everything looks bigger and more visible on the tablet. But that comes at a price of portability, it is meant to be used indoors and sunlight will make the screen totally unviewable. But other than some minor complaints, this table is worth every penny.\n\nHere's a list or pros and cons that I've managed to collect in the short period of usage, I've spent most of it downloading apps and enjoying the new features and capabilities of my new toy. One reason I bought this is to install the Skype software which provides for voice and video conversations throughout the world. So with that said, let's go on with the list:\n\nPros, The Good:\n\nPrice - Amazon's price beats everyone.\nQuality - Much, much better than the cheap competition.\nSize - Just right and very slick, the dust cloth comes in handy.\nIpad Screen - The 9.7 screen and 1024x768 res is a standard for tablets.\nFast Wifi - Wireless connection and speed are both easy and fast.\nWorking GPS - No antenna cables here, the built in chip works like the phones.\nWorking Bluetooth - Great for pairing headphones and file transfers.\n512mb memory - Not the stingy 256mb found on other models.\n2g internal memory - More apps to load, no more out of memory messages.\n32g SD card max - You want more storage, just buy a 32g micro sdhc and you're set.\nAccelerometer\nAmbient light sensor\nFront facing camera and microphone for video call/chat.\n\nSettings behind status bar dropdown, very convenient.\n\n2g internal storage expands non-SD apps capacity. A big plus for apps that cannot move to SD.\n\nAmbient light sensor controls screen brightness. Saves the battery.\n\nScreen is very sensitive to the touch, a fly could probably land on it and cause unpredictable results.\n\nMost apps designed for the Ipad will probably feel at home on the LePan because of the same screen and resolution.\n\nCons, The Bad:\n\nNo manual, learn by trial and error. I haven't checked the [..] website yet.\n\nVery narrow handles cause fingers to touch sensitive screen.\n\nAccidental hit of back button very annoying. Wish those handles would extend out for better grip.\n\nComand button lights not controlled by ambient light sensor, hard to see in the dark.\n\nSDHC chip slot location very awkward, huge closure tab gets in the way. Bad design.\n\nHardware buttons are not labeled, must grope to locate.\n\nBack button should not be too sensitive to the touch, it will exit the app in progress. Extremely annoying.\n\nStill lack compatibility with some tablet apps due to hardware and software differences. Mostly video games that demand faster graphics chips like the Nvidia Tegra. Also the later version of the Android OS provides more features found in more expensive tablets."}

Did a complete reset wiping tablet and solved the problem.  Probably just a random event.  BUT, the tablet must have caught the thrive's SOD because it would randomly fall asleep and not wake up with the start button.  Had to do a hard reset.  Happened at unrelated intervals 5 times in the last two days.  Even though I'm now rather bummed, I returned the tablet---I really don't want to carry a paper clip with me for reset everywhere I carry the tablet.

Doesn't happen all the time, but it can get annoying when I need to check my callendar or something like that. I don't think any tablet will be perfect (or any electronic, for that matter), you just have to figure out what features are most important to you & go with it. My husband has an android phone & it is SUPER handy to share documents, callendar events, shopping lists, & so many other things. If you have the right apps, it can be a huge time saver. My husband & I can focus on more important things than arguing about the shopping list, how much money we have- or have spent, the plans for this weekend, or our daughters' physical therapy schedule. :)\n\nI've been shopping for a tablet for about 10 months now and I was agonizing over it because I am a mother & it is super hard for me to spend money on myself.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I was a little leery of ordering a tablet from an unknown manufacturer, but after using this device for a couple of weeks, I can honestly give it a five-star endorsement.  First of all, I really like the display.  It has a large viewing angle, has plenty of brightness (I usually have it set near the minimum), text is sharp and colors are bold.  I also like the 4:3 aspect ratio as I believe it is the best compromise between reading web sites or documents and watching videos (Apple had this figured out early on).\n\nThe construction quality overall is very good.  There has been a lot of discussion about the power switch.  I think they changed the design at some point because one unit I looked at earlier had a flush power switch, whereas the one I have now has the switch protruding slightly.  I don't think it's a big deal either way, but the volume up/down switch could use a couple of nibs to make it easier to locate.  Battery life is incredible, even better than my e-ink reader.\n\nThe software which comes with the tablet is the standard Android fare.  One nice addition is a file manager which will allow you to install non-standard, side-loaded applications not downloaded from Android Market or the Amazon Appstore.  Speaking of Amazon, I encourage you to install their Appstore right away and start collecting the free daily apps.\n\nOne thing you should be aware of is the device runs Android 2.2.  I confirmed directly from Le Pan tech support that there will be no upcoming Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0) upgrade as the hardware does not support it.  However, there are millions of devices out there running 2.2 and earlier versions, so it's likely that most app providers will continue to support it for some time.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I was concerned about the hardware because I've never heard of the manufacturer, but all my worries were for nothing -- the Le Pan tablet delivers in almost every way!  I work with many tablets and phones, so I am familiar with how a device should look, feel and perform, and if you are on a budget (or simply don't believe the hype that you have to by the top brand to get quality), then consider this device!\n\nPROs:\n - Large screen: Smaller tablets just don't suit my taste.  I wanted a large 10 inch screen, and this was the only one I found below the $350+ price range for a full-sized screen.... on a system that wasn't handicapped or buggy.\n\n- Fast, reliable hardware: I have yet to experience any serious issues with lag, or compatibility.  Netflix, Plex, & LogMeIn all work.  So far the only issue has been HBO Go, and the jury is still out on whether that's HBO's fault.  Also, note the SD slot will accept up to a 32GB SD card -- that fact put a smile on my face!\n\n - Solid software: The pre-installed software is decent.  It won't blow you away like Apple's or HTC's might, but it's simple software that gets the job done.  This includes the Google Market, which has been reported as missing on most other \"budget\" tablets!  Pre-installing more robust software is where the company could improve their product offering, but bottom line, since the Google Market is there, I simply downloaded the top-of-the-line keyboard and email programs that I wanted...  For less than $10 my problem was solved -- no need to get geeky and start flashing ROMs, downloading new OS'es, and risk \"bricking\" your tablet.\n\nCONs:\n - I wish I could adjust the two HOME DOCK items on the right side of the center Home screen -- these are preset to open the pre-installed browser and email programs, rather than the ones I downloaded.\n\n - The pre-installed browser and keyboard tend to go to a full blank page when you have to enter info into a box on a webpage -- this obviously doesn't work as expected.  After I installed a new keyboard I wanted anyway, this seemed to solve the problem for me.  Updating to a top-notch browser might also do the trick.\n\n - I do wish I could customize a few things more, such as setting the volume for each notification type separately.  Currently, there are just 2 volume settings, and new email notifications play thru the tablet speakers even when headphones are plugged in -- I can understand the reasoning, but it still feels odd.\n\nThese are the only reasons for not giving 5 stars.\n\nBTW, I read a lot of comments in the reviews about a poor Power Button design.  Mine is easy to hit -- it protrudes noticeably in the top right corner of the device, so I can even find it in the dark -- so I'm not sure what the fuss was about?  Or, maybe Le Pan updated the design?!\n\nAll in all, a surprisingly good purchase, and one I HIGHLY recommend."}

My first was the 7in Velocity Cruz which performed admirably as an e-reader and not so well as a tablet entertainment device.\n\nWhat this tablet does that no other Android tablet seems to do based on peoples reviews, be it honeycomb,gingerbread, Viewsonic,WoPad, Archos or whatever, is work perfectly right out of the box! Mine was delivered with firmware update 4431 in place and android market ready to roll!\n\nWhy does Apple cost so much, because it's worth it and because it WORKS out of the box! And so does my Le Pan 9 days later running 12 apps. Not including games: Kindle, Craigslist, Amazon App store (i prefer to android), and a fully functional NETFLIX...Yessss. My email accounts were a breeze and contacts went right in without me even realizing until 2 days later. And let me tell you, the internet is awesome. Dolphin browser is the way to go! The Kindle App looks just like what the Fire appears to be, nook style lower pane with a graphical cover up top.\n\nI paid $269 w/ free shipping for my Le Pan. The machine runs so smooth. I am not a computer guy, though i know enough to get around. For me it's time. I don't have a lot of it, so messing with a tablet for a few hours isn't my idea of a good time. My guess as to why this tablet works so well (see other reviews), is that the hardware matches the capabilities of the software better than most other \"Droid\" devices. I have no desire to upgrade to Honeycomb, ginger bread or even ice cream cookie. This device runs so smooth already, why mess with it.\n\nThere are a couple of Caveats the buyer should be aware of. the 30pin charging cord is proprietary and NOT swap-able with Apple, 2. No HDMI out, 3. Unknown Brand. For me the HDMI is not an issue. The cord was a bit of a let down though. I contacted Le Pan, (Matsunichi Digital USA) and arranged to purchase 2 OEM cords and 2 OEM USB charging plugs for  $28 dollars total, including the shipping! LOL\n\nI bought an APPLE Ipad Leatherette folding folio/stand by Targus from Best Buy and of course a 16 Gig drive. The small power button a lot of people complain about is really no big deal especially since it fits snugly under the hold down elastic without turning the unit off.\n\nOverall you can tell I am pleased with this device. I decided what I wanted out of my Tablet, did my research and came out with a good buy. It bears repeating one more time....IT WORKS PERFECTLY RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!"}

(7inch is too small for me), It was the right price (between $200-$300)and last but not least it was running Android 2.2 which is the same OS I have on my cell phone. The specs were what I wanted (at least 1GHz procesing speed and 1024X768 high definition touch screen). I don't really care for Apple products or prices so the Ipad is not for me.\n\nThis tablet is very nice. I was a little surprised by the weight of the tablet (No big deal). The power button is akward but other than that I love this tablet. The screen is beautiful, it is very fast and I'm familiar with how the OS works. When you have a internet connection, It's like having a personal computer wherever you are. Every time I have the tablet in public, people ask \"is that the ipad?\" I tell them \"no, it's better\".\n\nOne drawback was trying to find nice accessories for the LePan Tablet. Other than a few ugly cases, there really are none. However being the brilliant mind that I am, I discovered that the LePan Tablet is the same size as the HP Playbook Tablet so I have all kind of accessories to chose from. If you don't want to spent over $300 and you are fimilar with and liked the android system then you will find the LePan Tablet much to your liking."}

This is a 10\" tablet PC.  If you are in the market for a 10\" tablet, you'd be hard pressed to find something better than this (for the price).  It's valid to compare this to the iPad2 since they are about the same thing, really.  The iPad2 really is the cadillac of tablets.  They should be.  Apple basically invented them and everyone else is catching up.  So you have to ask yourself \"What do I want in a tablet and what am I going to use it for?\"  In my case I wanted to sit on my couch and browser the Internet, play games, maybe watch a movie or look at pics when I'm out of town.  I didn't need the cadillac of tablets for this.  I also didn't need a 3G connection since everywhere I will use this thing will be wifi-available.  I also didn't want to be locked down to all of the Apple proprietary crap.  Droid is a good OS and works for what I need.  It can do 95% of what the Apple tablet OS can do.  Plus, with the micro SD slot in the Le Pan it's infinitely expandable whereas if you run out of space on the iPad, you're kind of screwed.  Don't go to Best Buy and buy a Droid OS for $400 or so.  This is a solid-built, great little toy.  Honestly, what else are these things useful for?  They are fun.  This is a great, little tablet."}

My parents have a desktop computer on which my mom loved to play freecell. Several weeks ago I made the 4-hour trip to take an old laptop there so that mom could play freecell and read email, but she never was able to make the association between the trackpad and the cursor on the screen - she kept trying to move the cards on the screen with her fingers. That was a bit of a eureka moment for me.\n\nSo I picked up two of these tablets - one for my mom and one for me (to make it easier to answer long distance tech support questions). It looks like it's going to be great...I'll post a follow-up after I deliver the tablet in the coming days.\n\nNOTE: The only video chatting app I've tried that works with the front-facing camera on this tablet is the app for the Tango service (in the marketplace).

Well folks...I have found it! The Le Pan TC 970 is an Awesome Android Tablet! The touchscreen display is beautiful and smooth, the Android 2.2 is awesome and super easy to use, the WiFi is easy to connect, the Bluetooth is nice, the speakers are not bad at all even though other reviews say they are terrible...not true at all, the battery life is Amazing (10+ Hours), and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the materials used for the Le Pan and also how heavy duty and sturdy it is. I recommend getting a stylus for this tablet because the fingerprints on the screen will drive you crazy and I also wish it had bigger internal memory cause I had to buy a 16 GB Micro SDHC Card ($30) so I could store movies and music on the tablet...because the 2 GB is just way too small...other than that it is an Awesome & Inexpensive Android Tablet and I am very happy I decided to take a chance on purchasing the Le Pan TC 970. Thank you everyone for the good reviews here on Amazon to help me make my decision.\n\nUPDATE: (10/17/11)\nI am still in love with my Le Pan! The battery life is even more amazing that I have previously thought. I played on it throughout the day for 3 days in a row and barely used half the battery. The apps all work fairly well and it is so much fun to relax on my couch and play on my tablet vs. having a hot laptop sitting on my lap. The Le Pan also works well on long trips to have fun and pass the time away...of course do not operate it while you are driving...LOL! I bought a stylus for it which works very well at keeping the screen fingerprint free, but I also bought a screen protect and man was that a waste of $13!

The tablet seems to be very reponsive and fairly quick when using apps.  I have noticed some lag when using the internet, but I have been satisfied with the overall performance of this tablet.  It would be nice to have more internal storage as 2gb seems very small, but with the microSD you can add additional storage.  One thing that I am a little unsatisfied with is that most apps seem to be phone based and not tablet based.  Also, some apps that I would like to use is not compatible with this tablet, yahoo messenger is one of them.  This is my first tablet so maybe I should have expected this with an Android tablet, but it was a disapointment.\n\nMy tablet came with the latest firmware and I also have comfirmed that Le Pan plans on issuing an update to the Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) in the first quarter of 2012."}

Consider the quality, ease of use and price of le pan tc970, it is definitely one of the best android tablets on amazon.

I thought I'd try one more time, since I wanted something other than a laptop to browse the internet and e-mail, as an color e-reader for magazines and such (the Kindle is normally my go-to e-reader, but for magazines is not adequate), and a few games here and there.

The screen is easily the best I have tested with a superior viewing angle that puts many of the majors such as Xoom, Acer Icona, and HP touchpad to shame. Does everything I want with ease. Only cons I have are minor and easily fixed if the company wants to do so. Android 2.2, only 500mb internal ram with 2GB sd card, and screen locked in landscape mode on Home Screen. I upgraded to a 16GB sd card so now have ample storage, and flashed a new firmware from the maker that improved screen responsiveness even more. Bottom line, this is a VERY GOOD and reasonable priced tablet I would recommend to everyone. Maker says they are going to upgrade to Ice Cream Sandwich early next year, but I would have preferred Android 2.3 Gingerbread"}

For those of you who have used android system elsewhere may find it easy to operate this tablet, though if you never used android like myself still can easily get used to this operating system. However, I must say there are still few other features need to be added or improved. But because it is this operating system, it allow me to organize my schedule and agenda well in two separated windows. I was once really eager to buy iPad for its popularity and a collection of apple product, but almost half of what it cost for an iPad, I changed to android tablet and really found this tablet amazing not only in its price and most importantly its features which is as good and complete as to iPad. So if you are looking for an economically friendly and high-tech functional notebook, android tablet may give you all these desires."}

Most of my friends have iPad in hands. Of course, I can't deny its functionality and fancy outlook.\n\nHowever, the price is always the first thing I hesitate and concern. Why not pay just the half price and get the similar item as iPad?! So I keep my eyes open for any similar tablets such as Asus, Acer and etc., price-wise I found LePan is unbeatable with the same size as iPad.  Then I decided to give a trial.\nAfter using it for 1 month (almost everyday), I'm totally addicted to this tablet and strongly recommend to you. I carry it all the time even travelling country to country. I have to say it's amazing and definitely a nice travel mate not only for business trip but leisure one. I can easily transfer my documents (movie, ebooks...etc) into it and Le Pan is capable of handling everything pretty well so far.\n\nIt's worthy to note that the battery can last for quite an remarkably long time. During 10 hour of international flight, I used it for playing games, reading ebook and working on some word files (almost continuously 7 or 8 hours). It still had battery left after I got off the plane.\n\nThough Le Pan is still an unknown brand, the quality and the touch screen really surprise me!! The performance of touch screen is very precise and responsive. Plus, the screen is much brighter and more vivid compared to iPad. Also, I like the material of back surface, looks very elegant with blushed metal finish.\n\nHonestly, there is something I want to complain:  like the power button, the way too small to find. The built-in micro SD card is only 4 GB, I would expect larger capacity.  (haha...actually pricewise, it's really nothing to ask for).  Also, the fingerprints are very easy to be left on screen.\n\nOverall, this tablet really rocks!! Really worthy to buy '"}

Bought it prior a trip, planned to use it while traveling, turns out I am using it every day.\n\nThe device is solid built. Metallic body makes the device more high-end like. Snappy screen is very responsive. Finger smudge issue to me is the same on all tablets, just get it cleaned frequently. Built in speaker is just adequate, better to use a headphone when video chatting; sound/music quality is awesome with earpieces. USB cable easy connects the tablet with desktop or laptop for file transferring; the transfer can also be made via network without USB cable. The battery life is outstanding. I have been playing games, browsing the net, reading books, and watching youtube on TC970 for more than 5 hours, and the battery still got 40% left. The only disadvantage is TC970 bundle with 2GB Micro SD only, I replace it with my own 32GB Micro SD.\n\nInstall and uninstall apps are easy and fast. I have 2 or 3 force close due to apps error, not to hardware itself. As more Android apps published, TC970 is becoming a handy small computer to me. A great buy indeed!"}

Overall, the features of GPS, Wireless N, SD expansion and compact size makes this a wonderful deal, especially when it is price hundreds lower than the other alternative and I can browse site with flash too.  Now I mainly only use the Le Pan TC970 for my daily browsing, email and game over all other devices.  One item that can be improve, however, is that the power button can be a little bigger, but I can't complaint really."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "First off, I'd like to say that I have recently joined the smartphone world and purchased the HTC Inspire 4G (after having the old flip phones for the past 8yrs of my life). I still don't really know how to use my smartphone, but slowly i'm unveiling a lot of cool things about it here and there. I googled \"how to use the HTC Inspire\" and was able to watch a youtube video of a user using the phone.  From that i learned a lot on how to use the features and what the smartphone was capable of.\n\nThat being said, I purchased the Le Pan tablet soon after and now have all these cool gagdets with minimal knowledge of these technical items.  As a first time user, I think the tablet is amaazing! It has all the components of a laptop but wrapped up in a mini tablet.  I'm able to view/use excel, word, PDF files, etc w/ an app available in the market.  The free one only allows you to view the files, but it's not much to pay for the app that includes editing.  ALL the games work awesome on this tablet too.  I seriously think for the price you pay, you're getting a lot more than expected.  The screen is very clean and clear and w/my screen protector it works just fine. Google Maps is on point as always and my pandora even works without any problems/glitches. Oh and for me, since I'm very socially connected to my friends thru FB, the Le Pan allows you to use the FB mobile app or even sign on from the internet and it appears as it would on a regular computer. I thought that was pretty awesome.  It seriously is just like a laptop.  I would say the only negative things about it, is that the speaker hardware could've been tweaked a little more.  The sound doesn't come out as clear or sounds muffled when at max level, but i mean the simple solution to that is, use headphones.  W/the headphones, this tablet is perfect. Movies/tv shows come out very clean!!!  I've yet to run into any technical problems or errors.  It sends updates, just like my phone, to help your tablet run faster and smoother. I wish I could be a little more detailed in technical advice, but again I'm new to the smartphone era, so I really don't know what's good/bad in regards to tablets. All I can say is that I LOVE MY LE PAN Tablet! I take it everywhere with me! On my free time, I read books using my reader app or play games(angry birds, paper toss, office jerk, bejeweled, fruit ninja, paradis island, etc; which all run and work perfectly fine. I let my niece even play with it because there's a kids doodle app).\n\nSurfing the web has never been so easy! Le Pan is a definite good investment at a decent price.  I have yet to buy a laptop but with this tablet I don't see it happening anytime soon.  Oh and the camera/video recorder is clean. Pictures come out awesome.  I've played with the ipad before (only games) and to be honest, being a new user to both I see no difference (other than the price) in both tablets.  The charger is also a USB connector so i'm able to transfer all my music, work, pics on my computer at home onto the tablet!\n\nOne more small negative thing about it is that the power button was hard to locate and it did only come with an index card telling you how to set up the wi-fi. If I hadn't learned to use my Inspire smartphone first, I definitely would've been lost on how to use the Le Pan.  Maybe a manual or website link to show you directions would be fitting for new users.  Either way, hands down my tablet is the best. Constantly with me at all times and assists me on a daily basis. Good job Le Pan!  Android all the way!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I have been using this Le Pan TC 970 9.7-Inch Multi-Touch LCD Google Android Tablet PC now for a while now. I wanted to wait until I had a chance to play with it and see how it works before I wrote a review.\n\nThe Le Pan came with everything as promised. It shipped and arrived fairly quickly via USPS with amazon free shipping. Upon opening the box, I found everything inside that was promised- tablet, charger, and manual. Of course it needed charging and I plugged it in overnight.\n\nWhen I started to use the tablet I found it was pretty similar to my IPhone, but it was Android instead of Apple. It took me little time to get familiar with the tablet because of my past experience. The Google Marketplace was installed and it was easy to browse and install various apps that I wanted.\n\nI have been able to upload many of the apps that I use on my phone as well as an \"office\" suite for all my docs I want to have with me. I was able to find an internet browser that supports most of the movie formats and that is a great addition. I have been using the USB plugs to bring many items from my desktop into the pad and the fact that it has memory card slots- micro sd- i am able to change it our with all my other device that i have with me, makes its memory grow. It come with a 2G micro SD but i change it out a 8G card cause all my other device like my camera and my the HTC phone both use the same type of SD card, so this made it fairly easy to upload and switch out files for me. The camera works well and overall, I have had no problems with the unit.\n\nI think my experience with the Iphone has helped in knowing how the tablet works and give me a guide line and a better understanding on how the Le Pan Tablet work. It is no different than when you go from Windows to Windows 7- it takes a little time to get used to something new.\n\nThis is one slick little gadget that I am finding it very useful- at $200-300 less than an i-Pad and with more standard features- it is a great buy!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "In the beginning, I did hesitate since it's an out of nowhere brand and there're bunch of similar tablets on the search list. But after read through all the comments I decided why not give it a try. Especially this tablet has a 4:3 ratio display screen from a commonly used 16:9 scale on the market which is exactly what I am looking for.\n\nWell...after 2 weeks getting along with my le pan tablet, I have to admit its performance is amazingly way more than what I expected at first place. The screen is no doubt reaching my most satisfaction, big, vivid on the color, great sensitivity and easy to use. And also it's capable of handling multi-task without slowing down; I can watch online movies, view/share my images, do website browsing, check my emails and chatting with my friends at same time. It's a true pleasure using it honestly! Right now I don't even have to open my desktop pc and I can have my entertainment and routines done without any problem.\n\nThere are indeed some imperfections on the tablet. The most dissatisfaction to me will be the storage space is little beyond the standard on the market although it is upgradable up to 32GB capacity. . It'll be great if it equip with one 8GB SD card from my point of view.\n\nBut overall, I love it and i will keep using it as my portable entertainment device."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I've been using the Le Pan tablet for about 3-weeks now.  First off, I have an HTC Evo cellphone that runs Android 2.2.  And this Le Pan runs Android 2.2.  So right out of the gate I was pretty familiar with how to run this Tablet.  But, Android 2.2 is not really designed for use in tablets (there is a newer version of Android designed for use by tables).  So for Android 2.2, not all Apps work well on the table; examples:  Words With Friends is not usable on my tablet and I haven't figured out how to adjust it (the bottom few rows are cutoff on the tablet screen), my son reports some of his app games don't work on the tablet, but luckily for my son all the Angry Bird / Angry Frog / Angry Dad games work great on this Le Pan tablet.\n\nIn terms of the brand I have never heard of Le Pan.  I even googled their name and there is almost no info out there.  Documentation that comes with the tablet is very sparse as is info on the web.  Maybe the info will increase over time.  This type of info is somewhat important for me because I'd like to know if this tablet will be upgradable to the newer version of Android software designed for tablets.  Also this would help me try to make tweaks/fixes to such things as Words With Friends screen size.\n\n +My pros:  Does seem to have good build quality (feels solid), Android Market appears as a standard icon and has been easy for me to download apps, screen display is nice, was easy to get up and running and synch to my home wireless, battery life seems decent, takes micro sd memory card so you can add bigger size.\n\n -My cons:  Power Button is very tiny and pain in the butt to turn on and off, sometimes the screen will turn back on for no reason, the 4 Android buttons are backlit but only for a few seconds - so if I'm using this thing in a dimily lit room I can't see where the buttons are and I can't figure out how to adjust the backlight timing (I googled around alot trying to figure this out but no luck), the charging cable is kind of a strange size (would prefer standard usb cellphone charging cable), relatively anonymous company so not sure about future support and info (eg; can I upgrade to newer android software, etc).\n\nNow compared to iPad, my friends iPad seems much slicker.  His iPad is faster, screen seems brighter, and everything seems integrated together more.  But then again part of this is just the nature of Apple's closed ecosystem vs Androids open ecosystem.\n\nOverall, I give this 3.51 stars (rounds up to 4).  It is a usable tablet, and better to use around the house for me than my Android 2.2 cellphone because the screen is bigger.  But, I deducted 1.49 stars for the cons I mentioned above as well as the fact that at $350 this is a bit pricey in consideration of the cons I listed and other Android options that are out there.  If anything notable occurs subsequent to this review then I'll come back and give an update here."}

I never even USED a tablet before!\n\nWhen I received it, I was left to my own devices to figure out how to get it onto our wi-fi. Let me mention that it comes with a single page cheat-sheet and that's it. So, I turn it on and lo and behold, it's relatively easy to configure. Took me about 20 minutes to get it hooked up to wi-fi. For me, that's pretty awesome. Like I said, I'm not a techie. I also began to download games pretty easily.\n\nLike another review said, that sound is a bit tinny. It would do well with a 'mega bass' or something like that.\n\nOnce it crashed on me while playing lots of games at once. I've found that by plugging in the recharger helps get it back.\n\nOverall, it's a great product and has stood up to about a month of constant activity with one crash. It's easy to set up for the newbie too."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I have had the Le Pan tablet for 3 days and I know that is kind of quick to make a judgement but I had to make a review. I am actually contemplating returning the unit, it has a bright spot of light about 1/4\" wide on the screen in the left center of screen like the tft screen is worn away there, so starting off with a defect. I come pre-biassed because I bought a Asus EEE Transformer Honeycomb tablet and ordered the base laptop for it. I was online and saw this, because I could not justify spending almost $600 on a tablet + base so I was going to return the ASUS. However after comparing the 2 I have to say the ASUS wins hands down. The ASUS is only $399 (without base), this one is $349. I do not like Honeycomb and thought I would get a tablet with Froyo but the ASUS screen is SO MUCH MORE CRISP. I will say the screen is very crisp and has VERY wide viewing angles on the Le Pan, but any video I play I see pixilation and bluryness as the processor is not a dual core. The quality of the resolution on the Le Pan is not as good. I do have a fast N connection and get better video on other tablets. The ASUS pad has it's own issues with video and I hate Honeycomb so far, but I cannot justify spending $50 less and getting a tablet (Le Pan) that is NOT widescreen (9.7) 4:3 ratio and so far has no real history or support. I don't want to be stuck with a tablet that 6 months down the road, the company will not exist or support updates. I will say the unit does play Angry Birds well, so other games should not be a issue. As others have said Netflix does not play out of the box. The few things this tablet has going for it, is long battery life, GREAT viewing angles, it DOES fit most generic ipad cases very well and it is fairly light with good build quality. I don't know why they chose to put the charger port at the top of the unit though. Overall the unit is good if you just want something that works and fairly good quality that mimics the ipad shape. I however think I will stick with the more known companies products right now."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I've had the Le Pan TC970 for about 3 weeks now, and it's a pretty nice tablet pc.  It has a beautiful display, is fairly light, and has good battery life.  The processor seems well-suited for what I've used it for: email, Facebook, and Angry Birds!  I didn't experience much in the way of lag or delay, it seemed to chug right through whatever I threw at it.  The speakers are good, not great; I would have preferred the headphone jack to be on the side or bottom instead of the top.\n\nNow for my complaints:\n\nI've experienced some edge bleed, white light shining through at the edge of the screen.  Not a big deal most of the time, but always noticeable.  Could just be this unit, or it could be a sign of poor quality control.\n\nDoesn't play Netflix, though the application can be downloaded. I've seen previous reviews say you can manipulate the software to play it, but that's more that what the average user will want to do - or should have to do.  If the Le Pan played Netflix, I would have given it another star.\n\nIt won't stay asleep!  Pushing the power button once will put the unit to sleep, but not power it off.  This is the way my other Android devices have worked as well.  The difference: The Le Pan will turn itself back on after a minute.  It can be sitting on a table, asleep, and it will wake itself up.  It's really just annoying, because it'll catch my eye and distract me - something I resolve by powering off, but it could lead to battery life issues down the road.\n\nNot a fan of the power connector.  I think they're commonly referred to as \"10-pin connector\", but being that the other end is USB, I don't know why they couldn't have just made it mini or micro USB for ease of charging.\n\nAll in all, it's a good tablet, especially considering the price point. If you're looking for email, Facebook, & Angry Birds, I highly recommend it.  If you require a powerful tablet that can run Netflix, keep looking."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "This is a relatively reliable and affordable device, but one that's a bit frustrating if you're used to working with Apple touch technology.  The iPhone touch recognition/sensitivity has always been seamless for me, which makes it all the more annoying when the Le Pan tablet freezes or jumps a command when you're performing basic tasks.  When you rearrange icons or slide the touch bar to unlock the device, for instance, it's not a smooth movement, and tends to stick.\n\nBut as far as essential functionality goes, it's been more convincing.  The internet and all applications work perfectly; the webcam is decent quality for the price; and the speakers and sound system are likewise acceptable.  The display is really beautiful, so no complaints there either.\n\nOriginally I thought this would be great to use with Netflix's online streaming.  Unfortunately the Netflix app doesn't work with this device, so that was a fail.  On the bright side it does play Flash videos so it's much easier to watch videos associated with news articles and the like than with Apple's technology (or, confession: South Park Studios . com)."}

Truthfully this is an amazing product, both my wife and I have had it for about 2 weeks and we love it.  What people don't realize is that most of all the tablets in the market come off the same factory lines, therefore from a hardware perspective there isn't much difference, it's really in the software and the user interface.  Many people still stay loyal to their one and only \"Fruit\" company and pay the high dollar for the product.  I would suggest this product to anyone who isn't caught up in the name brand and really want to use the tablet for email, surfing, games and some document retrival, which is about 95% of the market.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "This tablet works well, but I don't think it's as great as I'd hoped. I have a feeling I won't use it as much as previously expected, but that's simply me. Some people may have much more use for it, or have more appropriate uses, so this review is simply based on its potential use in my everyday life.\n\nPros:\n\n- Android OS. I'm a big fan and it works very smoothly.\n\n- Seamless Google integration. Everything is easy to install, sign up for, log into, and use.\n\n- Quick download of apps. They download faster on my home network on this tablet than they do on 3G on my phone.\n\n- Prettier than the picture. I was a little worried because the picture doesn't make it look so great, but it definitely looks nicer in person.\n\n- Video plays very well. I tried out YouTube and it plays seamlessly with pretty good sound.\n\n- Really easy to use, especially with prior knowledge of the Android OS.\n\n- Comes with a 2gb card. While this is actually kind of small (my Droid came with an 8gb card), it's still more than is actually in the internal hard drive.\n\n- Touch screen works very well. Multi-touch is delightful.\n\nCons:\n\n- Weight. It's kind of heavy. You can't hold it for long periods of time without your hand getting tired. While I like that it's \"solid,\" it's still somewhat straining.\n\n- Glare. Seriously wicked glare. I know it's a lighting issue, but having tried it out in several places, it's distracting and very noticeable.\n\n- Fingerprints. I swear they cling to it. I don't notice this as much with my Droid phone, but this one just collects fingerprints. They don't wipe off very well, either.\n\n- On/Off button. It's ridiculously tiny, hard to find, and hard to push. You literally have to search it out every time you want to turn it on.\n\n- Nothing to offer that's not currently on my phone. I have a Droid, and everything on that is also available on the tablet.\n\n- Camera. There is no rear facing camera, just facing the user. This is helpful for using Skype, but not for taking actual photos.\n\n- Volume buttons. These are small and hard to use, as well.\n\n- No directions. It provides a Quick Start Guide, the size of a postcard which only tells you how to connect it to the computer and to the Internet. Not that helpful. It also has a tutorial in the settings that didn't impress me at all.\n\n- Not-so-easy keyboard. The keyboard is awkward, not sized for fingers (even my small fingers) and difficult to type on. The iPad has a really great keyboard, but this isn't even close.\n\n- Not an iPad. I admit, I'm an Apple FanGirl and this just doesn't quite do it for me. It's not as shiny and smooth, which is definitely not the fault of the tablet itself. This has no bearing on my actual review.\n\nI have a feeling that I would like it a lot more if the Netflix app worked. As of right now, it only works with a handful of phones. I'm looking forward to the day that it does work, and I may find myself with more uses.\n\nThis tablet definitely has potential. I look forward to searching out additional usages for it."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "Who needs a tablet computer?  That is what I've been saying to my Apple Fanboy friends since the iPad came out.  Honestly, if it weren't for the Vine program, I would not have gotten a tablet.\n\nMy first impression, out of the box is, I'm impressed.  It seems to act just like my Android phone.  It is very responsive for a 1GHz cpu.\n\nThe instructions that come with it are non-existent, a card with where the buttons are.  Their support page gives a URL error.  Their FAQs has no entries except for the specs.\n\nCons:\n* The sound is very tinny.  It is not very good, especially compared to my friend's iPad.\n*  No rear facing camera.  So this is only good for chat.  Can't really take pictures or use a scanner app.  A little disappointing.\n* The auto-brightness doesn't work very well for me.  I think it makes the display too dark under all lighting conditions.\n* It cannot play trailers from apple.com/trailers.\n* The system tutorial in Settings->About Tablet doesn't work.  It just returns to the previous screen.\n* Android 2.2 is not designed for tablets.  Google said this.\n* The wireless can use 802.11n but only the 2.4GHz band and not the less cluttered 5GHz band.\n* My biggest complaint is that both the on/off and the volume buttons are very hard to use.  They are too small or too recessed.\n\nPros:\n* The display is very nice and a good size.\n* Price, though I think they could have sprung for more than a 4gb card.  Even my phone came with 8bg card.\n* Battery life seems real good.  I've been using it for over 3 hours over two days and it is at 56%.\n* The Android system is a plus.  I hope it can be upgraded to 3.0+\n*  It comes with the Kindle app installed and ebooks look real nice.  I do still like my Kindle better since it is so much lighter.\n* Touch screen is very sensitive.  I find if I press too hard, it doesn't work. But of course that kind of sensitivity can be bad too, because I press things I don't mean to all the time.\n\nSome other notes:  I tried Firefox mobile on it.  It doesn't feel like Firefox and the password manager doesn't allow for a master password and that made me nervous.  Also flash did not work with Firefox, so I removed it.  I do not like the generic Browser on Android.  So I will be looking for a new one.\n\nI installed the \"Hackers Keyboard\" from the app store and really like that.  No more hunting around for special keys, they are all there.\n\nI played some games that required interaction of the touch screen and the motion detections system.  Both worked very well.\n\nYou might think from all my cons that I don't like this tablet, but that is incorrect.  Most of the cons are nits.  If you are looking for a device that you can sit on the couch with, browse the web and check email, this is it.  It would be nice if the speakers sounded better (I'm looking for an equalizer app) and if the buttons were easier to use, but this is a very nice device for $350.\n\nUpdate 5-30-11\nAs of today, I would NOT buy this tablet.  It does somethings nice, but many things including Netflix don't work and Le Pan has not plans to upgrade this to Andriod 2.3 let alone 3.0 or above.  They make a nice tablet and plan to release another 9.7 with 3.0, so I would wait.\n\nUpdate 7-24-12\nNow that I can, I've changed the rating to 2 star.  It was an okay tablet while it worked with the flaws mentioned above.  But as I suspected, they never updated the software.\nAlso, the Wi-Fi died.\nInto the recycle bin for this tablet."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I wasn't expecting much with this tablet, being a brand I've never heard of until now.  Easy to set up, as soon as I entered my network password, the tablet connected right away.  I wish a full size instruction manual was included other than just a quick start manual.  Once you get the tablet set-up, there IS a tablet tutorial buried down under \"Settings\".  But it would still be nice to have a full instruction manual available as a pdf download from their web site.\n\nThe screen is incredible, from the bright colors, relatively large viewing surface, similar in size to an iPad or a netbook screen.  I have a 4th generation iPod touch with Retina Display and comparing them side-by-side, this Le Pan tablet looks very similar, but even better since it's larger and I have no trouble seeing it!  And compared to my netbook, let's just say there is NO comparison.  The netbook will be put away in a drawer for now.\n\nHERE'S MY GPS EXPERIENCE:\nSitting out in my driveway, I decided to take a drive to see how the GPS works.  I pressed the Navigation Icon.  You have a choice of typing in the destination or speaking.  I chose speaking, so I said \"_____ Golf Course\". After a few seconds, a lady's voice started telling me the directions turn by turn as I was driving, it seemed to be tracking me as the distances to my next turn were spot on.  (Later, I realized my wi-fi connection was reaching my parked car in the driveway.)  The GPS gave one incorrect street name, and it took me to the driving range of the golf course instead of the main entrance 1/2 mile away on the other side.  Once I passed the entrance where it told me to turn, the lady said \"data collection lost\".  For the return trip back to my home, I was unable to connect to get return directions until I drove to a nearby McDonald's with wi-fi.  So, it does work, sort of.  I have never used a dedicated GPS unit in my car, but I'm sure those don't require wi-fi.  So my advice is:  Don't buy this just for the GPS.  Also, there is no place to mount it, so I had it laying on the passenger seat and I was afraid it might go flying if I had to stop suddenly.\n\nPROS:\n> The build quality is excellent.  The screen is shiny, not matte.  The back is a satin-finished black, with chrome accents on the sides. It comes with a screen protector installed - it had some small bubbles that I had to squeegee out.\n> The speakers have decent sound quality.\n> For a 1 Ghz processor, it's faster than I thought it would be at web browsing.\n> Works with web sites that use Adobe Flash (iPad does not).\n> Keyboard is easy to use, no stylus needed (at least for me!)\n> Plenty of Android Market apps to choose.\n\nCON:\n> The screen is nice and shiny but it's impossible to use outdoors on a sunny day for all the reflection."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0067XX3AI", "review": "I've mostly been impressed with this tablet.  However, a few months ago, the tablet went into an endless cycle where it would not boot, but instead just displayed the LePan logo, attempted to boot, failed and repeated the cycle indefinitely.  The reset button did no good either.  I contacted LePan and after having me try this and that, asked me to send the unit in for replacement.\n\nI did just that and was very impressed by their 1 day turnaround.  However, a few months later, the replacement unit is doing the exact same thing!  It's completely unusable and just cycles on and off in a continuous boot loop while displaying Le Pan and clicking about once each 5 seconds or so.  Very annoying.  Not sure what's up, but having 2 units fail with the same problem makes me question the quality of the product.\n\nThere are certainly things to like about it, and if it wasn't for the problems I've had, I'd continue to rate it 5 stars.  But presumably I'll soon be on my 3rd tablet and I find that to be unacceptable.\n\nUpdate Apr 19, 2012: A month or more ago, the unit magically started working properly once again.  It's basically a nice tablet, but I have had some problems with it, as noted below.\n\nUpdate Feb 22, 2012: As mentioned, I've received my 3rd tablet now.  I noted that the tablet received did not receive the most current software upgrade, so I upgraded the OS as per LePan's website.  At first, everything worked fine and my apps began loading via Amazon's Android App Store & the Android Market.  However, after a few apps loaded onto the unit *nothing* would install from any source.  I simply got an \"installing\" message that would not go away.  I could use the other functions of the tablet, but nothing would install.  I contacted LePan (again) and was told to reinstall the operating system, which is a hassle, plus I just set up all of my e-mail addresses and such.  I'll do that when I get a chance, but for now I'll continue to maintain my 2-star rating.\n\nMy original review, which initially gave this unit a 5-star rating, follows:\n\nI was a bit skeptical about this tablet.  After all, I'd never heard of the name Le Pan and it sounds like a cheap knock-off.  But I have to tell you that it's a terrific tablet.\n\nThis tablet probably has the most vivid display I've seen on any computer, including my far more expensive Fujitsu models.  The screen can be viewed from nearly any angle and is simply excellent.  Videos played on YouTube looked great and with no studder and some of the sample photos bordered on amazing.  The live desktop is nice and there are some cool options offered and a lot of customization available in nearly every area.\n\nIt incorporates Android 2.2, which I've never used, but it's pretty easy to figure out.  In fact, there are minimal instructions that come with the unit, but it's pretty intuitive.\n\nIt was simple to connect the tablet to my WiFi.  The operating system is fast and snappy, moving between applications without lag.  Many functions can be operated via voice command.  GPS is very cool and includes photographic maps.  The Le Pan TC970 synced quickly and easily with my e-mail and Google contacts.  I downloaded Skype and was able to make high-quality phone calls without hassle.\n\nThis tablet has a front camera that isn't fantastic but seems decent enough.  Sound quality is also good enough for a unit of this size and the battery life seems excellent.  Downloading applications from the Android Market or Amazon was fast and easy and there are countless free applications.  Most games without issue on the thing.\n\nThe unit is small and compact.  I think that many cases which fit an iPad2 could potentially fit this unit, as the sizes are similar.  The Case Logic case I am currently using is a near perfect fit, although it does require minor modification.  I used a hobby knife (similar to an exacto knife, but more precise) and cut a bit of the case's vinyl material away from the Le Pan's controls.  I also cut out a small rectangle around the camera lens.  I recommend drawing the outline of where you want to cut in pen before you do so, so you get it right the first time.  I did not cut out material around the charging port, as I just leave part of the flap open when charging, but I suppose you could do that if you wanted to.  If you'd like to take a look at this case, just search Amazon for Case Logic IFOL-202 iPAD2 Folio (Black)\n\nThis tablet incorporates multi-touch and it's simple to use and completely accurate.\n\nConcerns?  Well, I had difficulty reaching customer support (855-537-2672).  I called the phone number provided and it said, \"For Polaroid press 1, for everything else press 2\".  I did that and the line rang and rang maybe 20 before finally telling me that the extension was not available.  Plainly, there needs to be improved support for a $350 tech product.  Also, the company's website, which is lepantab and you know the rest of the address, seems to be pretty simplistic without a lot of info.  I'd like to see that improved.  Finally, I'm not sure if the battery is user replaceable.  I'd ask the company, but so far I'm having difficulty reaching them.  I'll update this info once I have an answer.  Finally, the included documentation is lacking, in my view.  It's essentially nothing but a 2 sided quick start guide the size of a postcard.  While it's pretty easy figuring out how to use this tablet, some form of an owner's manual would be helpful.\n\nBut all-in-all, I really like this tablet.  I'm not sure what an iPad can do that this can't, but I'm guessing not much.  I highly recommend this tablet and I suspect it's one of the best Android tablets on the market.\n\nAdditional information: After I wrote this review, I tried out GPS.  To do this, I spoke to the tablet, verbally telling the it to navigate to my office address (to do this \"navigate to\" is the command).  It worked well, although the highly detailed, Google photo overlay only worked for a few miles before it reverted to a simple map image.  Still, it did get me to the office.  I then tried to route myself back home via GPS.  Because I didn't have a wifi connection, I was unable to do that.  So you can load a route via wifi and it will get you to where you are going, but you must also have wifi to begin a new route.  However, you don't have to have a connection once the route is loaded, if that makes sense.\n\nI have a Bluetooth speakerphone which broadcasts to FM stereo.  I was able to stream music and the GPS computer spoken commands through my FM stereo via the tablet's Bluetooth function as well as routed through my Bluetooth speakerphone.\n\nI also called Le Pan customer service this morning and received a call back this afternoon.  She said that the battery is not user replaceable, although that is common with units of this type.  I also asked about the custom case with stand that is made for this unit, but she didn't seem to know much about that.\n\nEven more information:  I received an e-mail from Le Pan customer service today.  Their cases are not yet available, but they said that many iPad cases might fit, as the devices are of a similar size.  I also scanned the hardware & software and here's what it said:\n\nManufacturer: Matsunichi\nModel: TC970 (Wi-Fi)\nDevice: griffin\nProduct: m6001\nBrand: Matsunichi\nVersion: 2.2\nCPU Info\nHardware: griffin\nProcessor: ARMv7 Processor rev 2 (v71)\nCurrent Freq: 1 GHz\nMax Freq: 1 GHz\nMin Freq: 300 MHz\nBogoMIPS: 996.74\nArchitecture: 7\nRevision: 2"}
