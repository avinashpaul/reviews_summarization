{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I bought it from another site (thing I regret). The thing I regret is that the other site was advertising $25 google play gift card, which I just discover to be an offer from Samsung and not the site itself, and I had to pay taxes that showed up at the email confirmation.\nThis tablet might seem overpriced, but it isn't. What you buy for $399 is a complete package which includes 2 year of dropbox (50 GB) for free... lets say $399 - $100 = $299. Now the tablet is like just costed about $299, -$25 google play gift card from samsung = $274. And now lets say minus Awesome note app which cost 5 dollars in iTunes, and the universal remote function... The price you pay is about $250 for this tablet + EXPANDABLE STORAGE!!!\n\nNow lets talk about its performance:\nThere is no worry about this tablet having lag or anything on the matter, you can compare it to the iPad and Nexus devices and it would run at the same level, although it (Note 8) has more software capabilities. The camera is really kind of bad when you compare it to the iPad mini, or the iPod Touch 5G, but would do the trick in good lighting conditions.\n\nThe software really adds to the experience and utility of the tablet. The multi window function works without any fault. It is fluid and doe not cause problems. The S pen really can create awesome works and tasks much easier. Am going to download the PS Touch with the $25 gift card, and I guess the S Pen is really going to come handy.\n\nAm sorry to not have a really good structured review, but I promise to update it after a month of the note 8 usage. I also want to add that I have had an iPad, iPod Touch 5G, Nexus 7, and a Sony Tablet and currently an iPad mini.\n\nI definitely would recommend this tablet to any one, but especially to the people that are looking forward new innovative software. The s pen as a college student add a lot of functionality on my algebra homework (less paper to waist). If you just want a tablet for emails, apps and web browsing-- look at the nexus devices and iPad, but IF YOU WANT MORE THAN THAT!!!!t.. THIS IS THE TABLET FOR YOU. My review would be 4 times bigger if I explained every function of the s pen and the tablet it self. Feel free to ask any questions."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "After almost 4 weeks worth of use:I will not comment more on anything else I have written about below, suffice to say that battery life while excellent is still about 70% of what the iPad mini provides(I still get about 8 hours of continuous use and 16 hours of standby on average each day.) Beyond that, in all other aspects, this has been a superior device(for me at least) than the Mini, which I still carry around as a backup(mainly for tv shows,movies and when battery is low on the Note). Why? essentially because the screen resolution, reminders and use of widgets far outclasses the ipad mini. Seriously, if you currently have any kind of Android Smart Phone and are familiar with the quirks*, buy the Note 8. If you have an iPhone and do not care about widgets and getting reminders/notifications that repeat, can be autosnoozed and that you can actually hear...then stick with the Mini.*Quirks: The Note 8 and any Android device can have battery drain while on Standby if you do not tweak your settings and/or have poorly written apps downloaded. My advice is to steer clear of free apps sponsored by ads, since that is a major culprit: buy the paid versions or do not download. As to tweaking Android settings, there are many pages you can Google depending on the version of Android you have, but this is a useful site:[...] Size compared to Nexus 7: I am hearing Ad Nauseum about how much better the Nexus 7 is for the price. Well that is not valid, in my opinion, if only because the size of the two tablets is so different. Yes really: even though the specs say only one inch difference, there is a huge difference in viewing and clarity: the Note 8(like the iPad Mini) is the perfect balance between a 7 inch tablet which is too small to be useful for productivity, and a 10 inch tablet which is too bulky and heavy. Comparisons in price should take this into account, as well as the stylus,lack of SD card support on Nexus 7 and the superior battery life(especially during standby) of the Note 8. Comparing the Nexus to the Note is like comparing apples to iguanas- a slight exaggeration perhaps, but you get the point. Go into Best Buy to compare: the Note looks about 30% bigger compared to the Nexus...It isn't, but that is how much more comfortable it feels.\n\nUpdate 8 on day 7: BATTERY LIFE- One comment I received was that someone was having only 3-4 hours battery life just using the S-Pen and no other app. While S-pen is a battery hog, that should still not be the case. I have to specify that I only have my brightness settings set to 35-40%(more than adequate even for video) and only turn on my GPS if I need it for directions(I get at least 9 hours of continual use). These two settings alone can easily double your battery life and is something I have automatically done on all my tablets for several years. Also, I have only the sound notifications I need turned on-for example I do not need Facebook, Ultimate TODO etc and other notifications, since my S3 smartphone handles those. Again, this makes a significant difference to battery life. Finally-the first day I received the Note I used it down to less than 5% and then fully charges overnight. Despite any other advice you may hear, I have always found a memory issue in batteries which is avoided by running down the battery as soon as you receive a device and fully charging it,then doing the same thing every few weeks. Battery life is always going to be subjective from person to person due to the difference in usage-but screen brightness,gps and notification settings are key factors for any user in preserving battery life on a mobile device.\n\nUpdate 7 on day 6: One negative I do have is the amount of bloatware on the device 16GB became 9.8GB. Fine if you had 32GB to start off with...but since the only current model is 16GB that sucks. Anyway, the good news is that even having downloaded 50 apps and hundreds of pics, several smaller event videos and dozens of books, I still have 7.8GB left. Does limit number of movies I can watch from Google Play-DRM Issue with not being able to move these to SD Card. I could root but in the past that has caused instability(especially after system updates), so I do not do that anymore. I would be tempted to deduct half a star for the bloatware(Google magazines. Allshare etc) but some people do actually use these. But they should just make them removable instead of system integrated. Titanium backup can help you remove these, but again I do not really want to Root, but I knew this going in and did not want to wait for a 32GB model. 90% of the time I do not need more than one or 2 movies on my device, so I can live with that.\n\nOh, I almost forgot, the Samsung keyboard has a feature you may not have noticed, but let me back up a bit. My favorite keyboard ever is SwiftKey(on my Galaxy 3), but I do not need it on this device, since the built in keyboard does the same thing for predictions and learning etc(IMHO). But also, if you need to go back on what you have written to edit,you can just run your finger/stylus across the keyboard to scroll backwards or forwards, up or down till you get to the area you wish to edit. Much simpler and faster than trying to pinpoint with the end of your finger/stylus. i discovered this by accident, even though it is in a user guide somewhere I later discovered.\n\nUpdate 6 on Day 5: The latest thing I have noticed, but did not mention yet, is the Smart Stay feature(under Display settings, default set to on). It ensures that the screen never shuts off while you are looking at it: so even if you have a 30 second screen timeout to save battery power(for when you glance quickly and then forget to turn off screen), you can read uninterrupted. It actually makes most sense to have a screen timeout of 1 minute for me I have found. Also, if there is a large amount of text on the screen, and you have a one minute timeout, the smart stay feature is phenomenal. I had not commented on this before, because i already use my Samsung S3 and so take this feature for granted. Turning this off is a mistake, since, trust me, you will use more power turning your screen on each time it times out otherwise.\n\nToday I received over 80 emails, read them and dozens of weather alerts and emergency alarms due to flooding around here. This is about 4 times more in notifications than usual, but no discernible increase in battery usage over the normal usage I have mentioned below. I am going to do some intensive video watching over the next couple of days and post the results on battery life.\n\nUpdate 5 on Day 4: With the Quad Core processor on this, it puts the Nexus 7 to shame. I can multitask at least 9 different apps with no noticeable lag or significant power drain. I read another review say that they drained 30% of the battery after reading 10% of a book. I read 30% of a book(150 real pages on Kindle app in 2 hours) with only 10% drain. So it is not so much how many pages you read but the amount of time it takes you to read, and the brightness setting. Don't get me wrong, the IPad mini(only one you should compare to due to size of screen)has significantly better battery life, but the Note is up there with the best of the Android tablets, and I will certainly trade some battery power against getting customization and widgets.\n\nUpdate 4 on Day 4: I installed 7 more apps today-New York Times,Ultimate To-do,Slice, Ap-memo, Data Vault and a few others. They were all optimized for tablets, as compared to even a year ago when that was most definitely not the case. With better resolution tablets and Samsung increasing their tablet market closer and closer to 50%, developers are churning out tablet optimized apps like crazy. This will solve the only real issue I see with this tablet. Then Samsung should bring out an amoled screen version of this device and with a higher resolution-something like 1900 x 1200. Even though that will not be as high as the future retina display iPad mini- the difference will not be noticeable. A combination of a more user customizable operating system,more tablet apps and better resolution, will(IMHO) mean the iPad Mini, even with a retina display, will get a run for the money. Also, I would stress again, that if you are going to browse the web a lot-definitely pick this(with Firefox) over the iPad Mini. Why use a device that does not allow you to increase font size and be able to fit that to the screen? i hate that about Apple mobile products0THeir OS does not currently work with Textflow software.\n\nUpdate 3 on Day 4: Battery life continues to be excellent. I have discovered that the S-Pen has an incredible utility, even if you are not a student. By pressing and holding on the microphone symbol next to the space bar on the Samsung Keyboard, you get a box pop up with several icons: Clicking the one with a capital T and and a pen on it, changes the input method in any App so that you have a scratchpad at the bottom to hand write. This is then converted into text. For longer emails or blogging, this is very useful. I also used it for shorter Facebook comments and jotting down smaller notes. My handwriting is not the best, but with a little practice I was able to be 80% accurate on the longer notes and pretty much spot on for the one or two line notations. I may not draw or take long lecture notes, but the S-Pen now had substantially higher value than originally thought. Also, it hands down beats a regular stylus for responsiveness, scrolling and smoothness. It literally is an extension of your finger, but with a much higher degree of accuracy and precision.\n\nUpdate 2: This is really just to warn anyone reading the first review (most helpful one listed), that there is a comment there in the middle of the review, that says the Note is really fast to charge-in 1 hour. That is not my experience and I cannot see how that would be possible, unless the tablet is at 80% or something already or maybe if there are no apps apart from what are preloaded(though i cannot see that either)- which admittedly may be what the reviewer meant. However I didn't read it that way and I think others might not either. I got the charge down to 5%-at which stage certain protection protocols are built in(cannot be altered that I could find), so the screen remained dim. It took 3 hours with the unit fully shutdown to charge back to 100%. Just an FYI to anyone thinking that there is an amazing 1 hour charge time. Hope this helps.\n\nUpdate 1: After 2 solid days of continual use I can say that the battery life is excellent in standby and while in use. It loses less than 1% per hour on standby. This is with WiFi AND GPS continually running, and updates for weather,email and other PIM apps running in the background. I get 15 hours of use per day with 7 hours on standby and 8 used continually for web surfing, reading, app store and downloading apps. Resolution is wonderful-screen angles superb at any angle. Better looking graphics than iPad Mini. nexus 7 and even pretty close to Kindle HD-despite the Kindle having much higher specs for resolution on paper at least. Samsung just make the best screens. I would,as other users have commented, not use this Note for intensive gaming, but RPG games run superbly and Google Play video looks just as good as anything the Kindle HD 8.9 can provide-again, specs are not everything, Samsung havedesigned their screems to maximize appearance and richness of video. Battery life when playing movies is great(compared to other Android tablets),I was able to watch 3 movies lasting 5 hours and still be on 60% battery. But i will test more, since in my previous experience, battery life runs down much faster when you get below 50%- a quirk of the Android operating system. This is an area where Apple still dominate with superior battery life. more to follow in the days ahead.\n\nOriginal review:\nFYI I got my device from Best Buy(barely 2 days ago) and since I am a Premier Silver member, I get 60 days to return. If you already use a Samsung S3, then this will be the perfect accompaniment: a very sleek, fast and eye-catching device-get Samsung's own smart cover for this since it is the best available currently at Best Buy(in white at my store) if you want the slimmest,lightest case that does not cover the bezel(my preference only).\n\nI essentially got this to be able to read my blogs and news articles, surf the web, track calender,reminders, to do lists. I can do this on the S3, but this way I get to save my eyesight a lot more: which suddenly has become an issue in my mid forties!! I also have an iPad mini which I love-but on any iPad device there is an issue of hearing the alarms, customizing sounds and changing snoozes, auto snoozing and generally having nagging reminders. There are some Apple apps that can help but not many to choose from. Android does not have that issue because of the open source operating system. So I use the iPad mini for portability,surfing reading,email,video facebook and games, and my S3 smart phone for all the reminders and tasks etc-they still sync onto my iPad mini, but I hear the alarms and get the nagging reminders on my phone. The Galaxy Note 8 now lets me have the reminders,surf the web with a better Firefox browser that has text reflow for virtually ANY site, shop, read and take a few handwritten notes excellently(Facebook app is awful on Android-Feria on Ipad Mini is a dream). Unlike other reviewers, the S-Pen is only useful in a minor way for me, since I am not at college or studying. All the other benefits listed above make this worth it for me on their own. One of the best things is the use of the Firefox app-being able to turn almost any page into easily read text format only, with adjustable font,is priceless when so much time is spent on the Web. As is the ease of which you can zoom in on any page, and the text will reflow to the larger font and fit the screen(also syncing my Desktop web Bookmarks and history): Essential, but something no decent browser on Apple devices can successfully accomplish-so on my Apple devices I tend to use Flipboard, Taptu, Zite and other RSS readers to fulfill the News functions.\n\nThe reason I am deducting one star is threefold: The price should be $350 to match the iPad Mini(the only real competitor to this product IMHO); There are not that many Android Apps truly optimized for Android tablets-unlike Apple and the S-Pen still does not have its incredible usefulness shown because there are only a handful of apps written for it. I deduct only 1 star for all 3, since the S-Pen is NOT the main reason I got this Tablet and with software updates/more apps on the way, I know this will change-so i deducted only a quarter star for this, a quarter star for the price, but half a star for Android not having more Tablet Optimized apps. Gaming is something I do rarely,but I find the Ipad mini/ my S3 to be excellent for that, since the battery life is phenomenal on the Mini especially. I will write more about battery life on the Note, watching movies etc when I have used it a few more days. I certainly am glad that I purchased at this moment however and hope this helps everyone who is considering, but confused by so many tablets out there right now. If this has been helpful or not please vote accordingly. I usually answer any comments within a day or so when testing out tablets-which is something I do as a partially paid amateur hobby. I have owned or tested virtually all Tablets released in North America over the last 4 years."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "Let me begin by saying that I typically do not purchase any types of technology at launch.  I made the exception in this case, because I believe in the ultimate usefulness of this product by Samsung.  I have owned many apple products and for a time, I did enjoy them.  However, I always grew tired of apple tablets and smartphones because I realized that they usually only work well with other apple products.  Furthermore, every iteration of smartphone or tablet was only incrementally improved upon by the company.  Apple makes very nice but linear products.  They offer a very streamlined approach to technology at all levels across their product line.  They are great, if you only wish to do very simplistic task; such as surf the internet, buy content from Itunes and apps via the app store. Ipads are great at content consumption but are equally as cumbersome to use as a content creation device.  This is truly where the note 8 shines.  It's a great bridge device between your smartphone and your laptop.  The S pen is what makes this tablet a winner.\n\nBefore any are quick to state that the Note 8 is overpriced relative to the Ipad mini or even the regular sized Ipad I ask you to consider the following:  The Ipad mini is quite literally built with the same internals as the two year old Ipad 2, which still sells at $399. The mini costs apple $115 to make and they sell it old components and all to consumers for the price of $329.  They are making a killing selling the same thing in a smaller package.  Is Samsung doing the Same with the Note 8 relative to the Note 10,1?  In my opinion, no.  The Note 8 is an improvement from the standpoint of a faster processor, better software integration with the S pen and what I feel is better build quality and increased durability.  The note 8 is a refined and improved version of the note 10.1.  The 8 has added greater functionality over the 10.1. these improvements to both hardware and software justify the price.  After all, the same individuals screaming about how costly this device is are the same ones that are willing to buy a mini which is only $70 cheaper than the dated and yet bigger ipad 2.  the tech which powers both the larger note  10.1, and now the 8 came roughly 8 months apart.  In short, this means that the cost of these components has not depreciated to levels which one could consider significant, when one considers the cost of manufacturing both iterations of this device\n\nThe apps argument is largely a creation of tremendous marketing skill on the part of apple.  There are few apps which cannot be found on both platforms and for those few I have always been successful at finding a suitable substitute.  I have found that a few android apps may lack some of the features of their ios equivalents...but these instances are dwindling inn number.  The same can be said of the app optimization argument.  Apple does a great job of creating apps specifically tailored to both the phone and tablet space but android is making strides to do the same.  I am willing to sacrifice the aesthetics offered by apple for the functionality offered by Samsung and android; specifically the note 8.\n\nFinally, an additional point is worth the mention.  I always find it funny when people are so obsessed with bashing screen resolution.  this is an 8 inch screen and quite clear and beautiful.  It is not a 50 inch LCD.  How many pixels can you cram into any tablet screen, before it becomes pointless and frankly entirely ridiculous?  Yes, there are tablets that are cheaper with better resolution but these do not employ the use of a fully functional stylus.  My point here is that i'm certain that higher screen resolution would have certainly come at the expense of greater S pen integration, software and functionality. These are the primary selling points of this tablet.  The galaxy note 8 is the best production tablet on the market at any size.  Its feature set alone makes it a must have for either a student or business professional such as myself.  I hope this helps those of you on the fence about purchasing the tablet.  For me cost and expense are relative terms. Yes, for $400 you could buy a full sized Ipad. But at that size, ask yourself how much will you use the device?  Will you get your money's worth?  I for one would consider this money well spent because I will actually use this device quite heavily making it worth the cost.  This is something I could never say about any Ipad I've ever owned.  Hope this has helped."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "---Update 12/18/2013 - I've moved all \"updates\" to the end of this review for easier reading---\n\nMy main reason for buying this tablet was/is to use it for taking lecture notes and reading books (college/work/technical books). I wanted something more portable than the Note 10.1 and this seemed to fill the void.\n\nSince this product has only been out for a day (when this review was written), I've had a chance to play with most of the features but not all.  This review is meant for those of you hanging on the fence, unsure of whether or not this tablet will work for you.\n\nFirst off, to save yourself some time, if you have no intentions of using the stylus for taking notes or modifying photos then stop reading this right now. The stylus IS the reason this tablet costs more than the competition and in my opinion it's worth the price.  Yes, there are more powerful tablets out there that are much cheaper but they don't have a stylus!  This tablet is designed for the person who likes to read/write and/or do artwork/photo-shopping.  If you don't need a stylus then you don't need to read this review (look at other products like the Nexus 7).\n\nThe Pros: Taking notes on this device is a dream (very precise, even for mathematicians)\n-The hand-writing recognition feature is pretty darn accurate\n-I can use Microsoft OneNote to take notes (yay!) See \"comments\" section for more info on this(page 2)\n-Supports a 64GB micro-SD card (search Amazon for the Samsung card)\n-The interface is snappy and the graphics are fluid (for the most part)\n-Internet browsing and switching between programs is quick and smooth\n-The device is easy to hold and is very lightweight\n-The image quality is crisp, clear and bright\n-Did I mention, I really love the pen and it's ability to glide across the screen effortlessly?\n-The infrared remote feature is pretty slick and worked with my Panasonic T.V. without issue\n-Comes with 50GB dropbox account (for storing and sharing files with others)\n-Includes a $25 Google Play credit for downloading apps\n-Very quick to charge (roughly 2 hours)\n-Plastic finish is very slick and clean - Metal bends and scratches so pick your poison\n\nThe Cons:\n-The price should be lowered by about $50 in my opinion because of the weak video card (see below)\n-The device comes with Android 4.1.x and not 4.2.x (Samsung hasn't announced when they will release the \"much improved\" update)\n\n***This no longer applies as I've found an app to replace this missing functionality*** -The following is a negative regarding Android and not the actual device: I made the mistake of buying a 64GB micro-SD card thinking I could store applications and games on it. Turns out, Android stripped out this feature and you can only put pictures, music and other \"documents\" on SD cards. So in short, the included 16GB of storage runs out before you know it (for power users). Save yourself the money, don't buy an SD-Card and use the DropBox service for storing all of your files\n\n-The graphics card is kind of weak for playing graphic intensive games but this tablet isn't really meant for that. For example, I played \"Real Racing 3\" and my framerate was probably 20-30 FPS. Still playable but kind of choppy. Additionally, when I unlock the screen with the stylus, the \"ink\" effect can be sluggish at times with a noticeable frame rate drop. Maybe an update will fix this.\n\n-Not really a con but lack of color selection(white)is kind of weak if you ask me - This can be fixed by putting it in a case.\n\nOverall: I bought this device to take notes and it does that VERY well. I can write complex math formulas and draw nearly anything I can think of without pixelation issues or accuracy problems.  The stylus IS the reason to buy this tablet. Don't go off of the specs or other reviewers who have emotional feelings toward this device.  If you're serious about taking notes (college students and corporate employees), reading e-books and playing the occasional YouTube videos and browsing the internet, you found your golden nugget. I did A LOT of research to find a replacement for my convertible-laptop (stylus enabled laptop) and I believe the Galaxy Note 8 was the right choice.\n\nI looked at the competition, even in the $1,000 price range and ultimately I chose this device. My complaint about the graphics card was to iterate the fact that this is not meant for hardcore gaming. Yes it will play Angry Birds and those other cheesy games but don't expect this to replace your IPad 3 or your modern smartphone. The graphic cards on those devices are way more powerful than what this little guy packs.\n\nAfter thoughts: For what it's worth, you can go to Best Buy and purchase the tablet. If you think it's not right for you, you have 15 days to return it and get a 100% refund. If you're a \"Silver\" status member at Best Buy, you get 60 days to try it out. After using it for just one day, I'm sold on the device and plan on keeping it. Your mileage might very. But I believe the portability and the note taking features of this device far out-way the cons. Other reviewers compare this tablet to other tablets that don't even have a stylus. That's just not fair. That's like me comparing a wheel-chair (which has a specific purpose) to a bicycle (which has a different purpose). Yes, both will get you around but they are designed for specific needs and I personally feel that the Note 8 will satisfy those looking for a stylus enabled tablet at an affordable price.\n\n**Updates to my review**\n\n***Update as of 7/1/2013*** Please see below for my actual review - I just wanted to let others know that my experience with this tablet has been great with no problems. For what it's worth, I am left handed and I have no problems with the built-in S-Note application (or any application) for that matter. My hand does not bump into things and I believe this tablet was made to accommodate both left and right hand users (despite the storage location of the pen).\n\n***Update as of 6/3/2013*** Apparently the comments section is so long, users have stopped reading the How-to's and have asked me how to use the microSD card for external/internal storage. Here's a quick excerpt so you don't have to dig through the comments:\n\n1. Firstly, you need to root your device which is VERY easy - Download and run an app called \"Framaroot-1.4.apk\" - Here is where I downloaded it from:\n[...]\n\n3. You can also follow these instructions for rooting your device:\n[...]\n\n3. Download one of the apps from the Google Play store and read the program's descriptions. It should walk you through the whole setup process.\n\nRoot External 2 Internal - [...]\nor...\nGL to SD\n\nHope that helps!\n\n***Update as of 5/23/2013*** If I haven't covered something here or in the \"comments\" section, feel free to drop me a question in the comments section and I'll do my best to help you out. Thanks again for all the \"Helpful\" ratings you've given me. It makes me happy to know I've helped some of you. I understand I can't please everyone so keep your negative comments to yourself please :-)\n\n***Update as of 5/7/2013*** Attention U.S.A. owners of the Galaxy Note 8. While we all know the U.S. version didn't get phone capabilities (3G data), I found an app on the Google Play Store (free) that allows you to make and receive phone calls for free. All you need is a wifi internet connection (Starbucks, your home wifi, etc) to place calls, and a Google Voice account (free). Firstly, go set up a free Google Voice account so you can get your free phone number (do a search on Google for \"Google Voice\".) Lastly, download the following app from the Google Play Store: \"Groove IP Lite\". When you run Groove IP, the application will want to link itself to your Google Voice number (assuming you set this up) and the rest is very seamless. The app allows you to use a Bluetooth device for making calls or the built in speakerphone. Enjoy!\n\n***Update as of 5/6/2013*** Look at the last page of the \"comments\" section for my instructions on installing flash and rooting the device. I've posted instructions on how to install Flash and root your device. I had too many emails to respond to so here ya go!\n\n***Update as of 4/25/2013*** I have found an app on the Google Play store that will allow you to use your micro-SD card as the \"internal\" storage and it's free. Additionally, after reading some tech articles, I figured out how to get Flash working on this device along with being able to quickly, safely and easily root the device. If you want more details, post your contact info in the comments section and I'll email you whatever it is you're after. I'm afraid Amazon will delete this review if I post links to 3rd party sites.\n\n***Update as of 4/23/2013*** I still love the Note 8 and highly recommend it.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "People are comparing this to the iPad mini and the Nexus 7, but there is no comparison, as this comes with the S Pen digitizer stylus. It is a premium price for this feature, but I love the S Pen, I'm sick of capacitive styli, and I was willing to pay for this feature. If you aren't interested in having a digitizer stylus, then there are a host of 7-8 inch class tablets for a lot less money. If you want a tablet with this feature that's less that 10 inches, this is your baby.\n\nI don't find the resolution to be a problem with any but the smallest fonts, and the system is powerful enough to be fast and fluid in every way. Other people have covered pros and cons fairly well, so I'll add some other things I noticed:\n\nThe Note 8.0 uses the same Micro USB cable and 5V 2 Amp charger that came with my Galaxy Note 2. I'm used to the proprietary connection on larger tablets, so this was an unexpected perk.\n\nThere's a lack of cases out there right now for this size device, but I have a Timbuck 2 sleeve for my old Kindle 2 that fits perfectly. The inside dimensions of the sleeve are 150 mm by 222 mm (5-7/8 inches by 8-3/4 inches), and it fits perfectly. You could probably fit it in a case with the inside dimensions of 140 cm x 212 cm, but you'd need some depth to the case (a sleeve that tight might not fit).\n\nUpdate 1 4/24/2013\nFor reference, I've also owned the Asus TF101, TF201, and TF700 tablets. I currently use a Galaxy Note 2 phone; previously I've used a Galaxy Nexus, Droid 3, and Droid X. My impression of the Note 8 is based on comparisons to the other Android devices I've used.\n\nNow that I've had this for several weeks, I absolutely love it. The size is perfect for taking with me to work, it's light and easy to hold for hours. The S Pen takes some practice to learn the commands, but now I can take a screenshot and make notes on it in seconds. The S Note app is the best I've used for handwritten notes, the palm rejection finally makes it so I can use a tablet as a notebook. You can import PDFs or images and make notes on them, and you can export them back out as PDFs or images. I've used the split screen a few times to make notes while I watch a video lecture, that feature is very nice.\n\nBattery life is excellent for a tablet. I get about 7-8 hours of screen time use before it hits 25%-30% (my cutoff for plugging it in). Screen use is streaming Netflix, browsing the internet, playing games, etc. Standby uses almost no power. I haven't let it sit unused for more than 8 hours, but the battery drop is minimal. I did set WiFi to turn off when the screen isn't on, this helps out battery life on any Android device.\n\nI've turned off the motion detection and eye detection. The eye detection had trouble with my eyes, maybe because I wear glasses?\n\nThe included IR apps are pretty useless to me. We don't have cable on our TVs- we use streaming services, BluRay, and gaming consoles. I have two Samsung TVs, one from 2009, one from 2010. Neither worked well with the included IR apps. There is an app on the Play market that is compatible with the Note 8 IR blaster (Touchsquid Samsung). At $19 for the home version it's expensive, but then I realized that the Logitech Harmony remote I bought a couple years ago was four times the price and died in 3 months. So, I bought the app, and while it has a huge learning curve, I can control my TVs, DVD, BluRay, Xbox360 and Roku devices with the Note. Very cool.\n\nFor the control freaks out there, the Note 8 rooted in seconds using Framaroot with the Aragorn exploit. THIS VOIDS THE WARRANTY. Unless you explicitly know why you want to root, don't do it.\n\nThe entire system is fast and fluid. There's no issue with opening a YouTube link, watching the video the switching back to the browser or app. My poor formerly beloved TF700 Infinity has barely been touched since I got the Note 8, because it had big problems with fluid transitions. Bluetooth connections to external speakers (Jawbone Jambox) and headphones (LG Tone HBS-700) keep the audio in sync with the picture, another problem that my TF700 could never overcome.\n\nThe Samsung keyboard is AWESOME! I love the swipe input and one-hand mode. Swipe input on tablets can be hit or miss, depending on the keyboard, but the Samsung keyboard in one-hand mode is small enough so swipe inputs can be done quickly. Also, it will automatically open handwriting recognition when the S Pen is pulled out. Previously, Swype was my keyboard of choice, but the Samsung keyboard is the most functional and comprehensive stock keyboard I've ever used.\n\nI continue to see reviews comparing this to the iPad Mini and Nexus 7. I stand by my assertion that there simply is NO comparison. Neither has expandable storage, digitizer stylus, or IR blaster. The stylus and IR blaster are not must-have features, but they are 100% worth the price difference. It takes some time to really explore all of the features, but I'm impressed with the functionality of this tablet."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "really? i mean why samsung put this price with only 16gb, no phone feature, and even no cellular? it is overpriced product. maybe it has a little bit faster cpu and higher screen resolution, but not worth the money. right now galaxy note 10.1 is $449, why samsung still selling this note 8 with this price? there is nexus 7 in the market already, and it is only $200, even ipad mini is $329. compare the price rate with apple, ipad 4 $499, ipad mini $329. even ipad2 $399. there is $170 differences between ipad 4 and ipad mini, and $70 between ipad2 and mini. in note8 there only $50 differences with note10.1 . come on, it should be $300 to $350.  i have note 10.1, and i compared with note 8 this morning, actuary there is no differences between these two tabs, only the size. sure it is  smaller, easy to carry. but there is no phone feature, and no cellular. in this price, i would like to buy the bigger screen for home use."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "In short, if you like the Galaxy Note 2 phone you will like the construction of this device.  I found it well built, light, speedy and a very nice device.\n\nHowever, I'm going back to my Nook HD+ while I wait for a similar device with a better resolution.  After having using a retina iPad, a Nook HD+ and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 1280x800 or lower just doesn't cut it anymore.  I've got used to reading a book where you can't see any jaggedness to the fonts.  There is a setting to enhance the fonts a little in the Samsung display options, but it's not the same.\n\nI've put mine up for sale.  Now don't get me wrong, it's a great device I guess I've just become a resolution snob.  :-)\n\nP.S.  If you register at Samsung you are supposed to get a $25 Google Store credit.  Do a Google for \"samsung galaxy note 8 perks $25 credit.\"  I tried to register but it doesn't seem to be functional yet, but don't miss out on your free $25 of apps/books/movies,etc.\n\nEDIT:  Samsung is still having some issues with the $25 Play Credit registration, but they'll get it figured out.  Someone made a comment about the Nook HD+ I must comment on; yep, it's only a great device if you sideload Google Play store on it.  Anyway, back to the Note 8!  It's really growing on me.  It has one of the best touch screens I've ever used, responsive, very smooth and really a pleasure to use.  It's run every game and app I've thrown at it, and after playing with the spen a bit more it definitely is nice to have.  Cool to pull it out and have a note auto open and then just jot something down.  I still wish the screen were a little better, but it's really a decent screen.  I would HIGHLY recommend this over the iPad mini, at least until Apple replaces the abominable 1024x768 screen in it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "Bought this tablet yesterday to replace my Nexus 7. I've always used a stylus with my N7, as I've found it a great way to interface with a tablet (and also keep the fingerprints down). From the moment the Galaxy Note 8.0 was announced, I knew I'd be buying it. So far, I'm absolutely thrilled with my decision.\n\nPros:\n- The screen is very clear and easy to read\n- The tablet is very snappy, even after loading all my apps, I'm still experiencing no lag\n- The weight is perfect - it's light enough to hold in one hand while writing with the S-pen\n- Samsung has added a lot of user-friendly features to Android\n- The S-pen is a stand-out feature if you like to write and take notes on your device\n\nOther:\n- If you're used to a device with on-screen buttons (Nexus 7 for example), it takes a lot of getting used to having physical buttons (and for some reason Samsung put the back button on the right side)\n- Many have complained about the \"cheap\" build feel of Samsung devices. While this device is plastic, it feels solid in the hand, and the plastic makes it light and very easy to hold in one hand.  Since most are going to put it in a case anyway, the back being plastic really doesn't matter.\n- The change between stock Android and TouchWiz is drastic.  If you've got a prior TouchWiz device, you'll feel right at home on this one, but if you're coming from Stock Android, be prepared for some adjustment.\n\nCons:\n- Only minor con is the price, but the S-pen and the hardware/software enhancements required to make it work well justify the additional cost over a Nexus 7 or the other cheap Android tablets out there.\n\nYou can't really compare this to the Nexus 7 - it serves a very different purpose.  If you want media consumption, the Nexus 7 (or the other cheap 7-inch tablets) is a great device.  If you want a note-taking, document-editing work-device, this is a perfect choice."}

And using the pen I am able to write just like I would on a paper. This has saved me from having to print out many forms, which I can fillout on this and then e-mail back immediately. It has a SD slot for added storage which has been wonderful for my pictures  The battery life so far has held up, I only charge it 2-3x/week based on my usage, and it charges with a USB cord so finding a replacement charger is not a problem.\n\nThe only drawback I can think of is that the 'framing' aroung the screen is a little annoying when watching movies, however it is very helpful when writting."}

My handwriting is atrocious, and I'm super disorganized (papers everywhere), so the thought of having all my notes worked out on the saved slides seemed so efficient. This didn't work for that purpose in the word processor I got, which was the $15 windows compatibility pack from the app store(sorry I don't remember the name). The presentations I was trying to interact with were integrated with 'clicker' questions, and the formatting wouldn't stay on those clicker slides without getting distorted when I saved the presentation after editing, and those clicker slides were showing fun nautical shapes instead of the slide content. AHOY MATEYS! Clicker slides in powerpoint are already kinda wonky, so this was probably an issue with the clicker formatting and not just regular powerpoint formatting. Non-clicker slides worked out okay.\nAlso, when writing with the stylus in the convert to text notation under a powerpoint slide for notes I took in biology lecture, the handwriting recognition software was quite good, but if I hesitated very briefly in the middle of a word, it converted it to text too quickly, and I wasn't able to adjust the timer on it. Also, when writing on a powerpoint slide with the stylus, there was no eraser tool, so if I made a mistake, I had to wipe everything I had written on that slide clean and start over. It was very tedious.\nI was able to get it to load Smartbook okay, though a little sluggish, and you have to download Adobe Flash manually( which wasn't in the app store). An easy google search fixed this.\nOtherwise, this tablet is great. It's intuitive to navigate.\nEvery person is going to be dealing with a unique confluence of factors like program and software variability for what they intend to use it for, and this tablet was *almost* everything I needed, but I ended up sending it back and sticking with my chromebook for taking notes in class, and I got a $20 bluetooth 10-key to make it easier for me to get my equations down quickly during lectures in math classes.\nI had zero issues processing my refund."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I needed something that will act as a reader, take handwritten notes with a pen and perform basic functions, mainly when traveling.  The IPad mini, which I have had for several years does all of these very well, except for the notes function and I have probably spent more on stylii that the original I pad.  None of them work and the IPad is just not built for that purpose.  Livescribe has been the best solution so far, but is an extra set of kit to travel wth. I hoped the Note 8 would fill that gap, and was quite pleased with the pen, the storage slot and the general feel of the Note.  However, the software is clunky, slow to react and often freezes.  Automatic brightness setting is so dim that one is always adjusting it.  The machine is not user friendly and I gave up and returned it after a week of intensive effort to get to grips with it.  Last straw, and I don't know if it is important, was that the software version is the last one available for this machine, and unlike Apple, it cannot be updated with any of the later Android versions."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I purchased this for my wife so that she could take notes using the s-pen rather than transcribe from paper. She has been using it for that purpose using built in applications as well as the newest version of Adobe Reader and is very happy with this functionality.  Turns out it is also much easier to read and respond to email using the tablet than on a cell phone so it gets lots of that use as well whenever she has not desired or had the ability to set up her laptop computer. The size is a perfect balance between portability and readability. All in all the Note 8.0 does what it does very well and at an affordable price compared to the fancier tablets that are designed for entertainment. We will probably wind up with another one just like it."}

The thing that pushed me over the edge was the \"S\" pen which eliminated the need for me to carry around a planner.  It fits nicely in almost any handbag.  The fact that you can hand write and it will type what you are writing and it does it very well. Or just leave it in your hand writing if you want.  iPAD has some apps that do similar things, but it doesn't do it well and where your hand rests on the screen makes marks on your docs.  I go to lots of meetings that require notes and Note 8 feels like you are writing with a pen. You can also hit record button for audio recordings embedded in your note document.  Also it lets you rest your hand naturally on the screen without impacting your document.  After I got it my husband and several friends had to have it.  We can't do without it since we attend lots of meetings that require many pages of notes.\n\nAnother key thing is you can add memory very inexpensively and pop it in yourself. (For iPAD you can not add memory...you have to pay lot's extra for a higher end model.  I bought xtra memory for about $5.00 and popped it into the memory port of my Note 8.\n\nYou can plug a USB with an adapter and read and play from USB memory sticks, including videos.  Just need correct adapter.  It also works for the DirecTV app the same way my iPAD does.\n\nFor some reason it appears Samsung replaced the Note 8 with the TAB.  That is a huge downgrade.  Get the older model Note 8 or a different size Note before downgrading to a TAB.  I would go back to my iPAD before downgrading to a TAB."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "Initially I was very pleased with this tablet.  However, just one year and 4 months later, the Wi-Fi just stopped working making it a useless product. I don't use the tablet everyday so the wear on it was very light.  The diagnostic and repair requires me to send the tablet in for repair at a cost of $159.00, which is more than half the cost of the tablet.  Before the tablet stopped working, I had purchased a Samsung Galaxy S6 phone and received a free Galaxy Tab 4 from AT&T.  They are both working fine so far.  I had planned on buying a Samsung TV but I will put off purchasing anymore Samsung products until they make good on this $299 Galaxy Note 8.0 tablet.\n\nUpdate 7/23/2015.  Went to a best buy Samsung Kiosk and the rep there did a SMART factory reset and software upgrade.  It did not resolve the problem so the rep suggested I contact Samsung Customer Service for assistance.  7/22/2015 I spoke to a customer service rep who said that although I was 5 months out of warranty he would try to get approval for a one-time courtesy repair.  He told me to send in all my purchase info to their Bill of Sales Team.  The Sales Team calls me this morning and ask me to email the information, which I did, she reviewed while on the phone and repeats to me that I'm out of warranty and that the only way they could extend the warranty is if I purchase an extended one.  I told her that I was under the assumption they were reviewing to determine if they could offer a \"one-time\" courtesy repair, she said there was not such option.  She transferred me to the executive customer relations department which was useless and very un-customer service like.  As a result I will not be purchasing anymore Samsung Products, including the TV's I had planned to purchased.  I have no confidence in the quality of their products and certainly have no confidence in their customer service."}

However, after the KitKat update, my tablet is now a paper weight. The battery drains after about an hour of use. Constant overheating messages. The cable in the charging port has to be jiggled before it connects and starts charging the battery which then takes more than 24 hours to charge to 100%.  Having googled the situation, I realised that this is a common complaint and a serious problem for this tablet.  Note that this only happened after the KitKat update.  It appears that Samsung has abandoned the Note 8 and does not intend to do anything about the problems its customers face with this tablet.  Customers who bought the Note 8 are left with a device that does not function properly.  There will apparently be no update to Lollipop for the Note 8.  So far I am not aware of a fix for the battery problems this tablet faces.  The advice seen so far include disconnecting the battery and reconnecting it, replacing the battery and the charging port and wiping the tablet and reloading the operating system.\n\nAside from the battery problem, the Note 8 is a really good device and I really do not want to spend another $300 to buy a new device.

I don't know why they couldn't have used a regular size SIM socket since it has lots of room but that's a big drawback if you want to use your existing SIM.  I checked with Frys, Best Buy, etc. but nobody locally had a SIM cutter so I had to order one on Ebay.  Another odd thing is that it has no Phone icon on the screen to use for calling!  There's a Message icon but I had to install the phone dialer app from the Play store.\nThe phone has some other minor problems too but they aren't deal breakers.\n1. Cameras are terrible!\n2. The screen is a finger print magnet.  After using it for just a few minutes it's so scuffed up that it looks terrible.\n3. There is only one USB port and you have to use that for charging.  It's normal for a phone to have just one port but a tablet should have more, preferably one on each side.\n4. The micro USB port is off center in the hole which makes it hard to plug in the cable and I noticed they sell replacement USB ports here on Amazon, that can't be good sign!\n5. It doesn't come with any sort of case or sleeve but needs one, preferably one that has a tilt stand.\nOn the plus side this was the unlocked version that is considered to be a phone that costs $600-$1000, model 5100.  Samsung makes several different version of this tablet from the cheapest one that is just a plain WiFi tablet, model 5110 to the middle of the road AT&T wireless tablet that uses data with a SIM but is not a phone to the 5100 this is a full phone with 8\" screen.  My T-Mobile SIM worked OK in the 5100 version but it will not work in the AT&T version even after it is unlocked because T-Mobile considers it to be a wireless tablet, not a phone, so it requires a special data plan with a different kind of SIM than a phone.  The AT&T version will work with a Freedom Pop phone SIM though."}

I've certainly owned all Samsung tablet products, most more than once, and most, several versions of each. It truly is just excellent in almost every way. The one down side is the bluetooth totally sucks--but considering the form-factor, it's handier with a stylus anyway.

With this one I just write like I would normally, which is much faster, then it converts the writing to text. It is just what I needed. Though this was the one deciding factor when ordering, I have found that I love everything else about it as well. It is like having a mini computer with me all the time.

I purchased my tablet slightly used and it is the best Android tablet I have ever owned.  I own a 10 inch Asus T100 and another Samsung Tab 3 7\". I would highly NOT recommend the Samsung Tab 3 7\" unless you plan to root it and install a different Android version in the hopes of speeding it up.  I love Samsung products but was disappointed in the Tab 3. So I decided to purchase a slightly used Note 8 at a great deal.\n\nSo far,  it lives up to the hype and the positive reviews.  I was seeking a tablet for note taking at work & utilizing Microsoft Office products for Android tablets. With  the right writing app,  I no longer see the need to use paper booklets and pads at the office.  With its speed,  it is also the perfect substitute for the office laptop in meetings.  I hate hauling laptops with all those wires and mice from meeting room to meeting room when this tablet can do all the same things.\n\nI can easily categorize my daily work notes,  take photos,  surf the Web.  Since I work in architectural design,  I utilize several sketch programs to come up with design concepts and although it is the same as sketching on paper,  it comes close.  The tablet is quick when sketching.\n\nAlthough there are newer models from Samsung with better resolutions and faster speeds,  if you find this particular model, new or slightly used,  I would recommend making the investment."}

I have already made the Android leap and wanted another small tablet. Looked into several options but thought the S Pen feature would be nice like on the other Note line devices.  The unit is pretty much the same size as an iPad Mini and works like all the other Galaxy products in my house.  I will say that I have reset and re-installed everything three times as of right now.  The first time it was set up wrong.  Copied all the content from another Samsung account and I opted to just reset and start over installing only what apps I wanted.  The issue I then had was that it locked up and acted weird several times.  Also ran the battery down very quickly.  Didn't have that issue the first time so I tried again, resetting the device and starting over from scratch.  This time the install was smoother and I haven't had an issue with since.  We took a two week vacation and the device was used constantly by everyone in the family and the locking up issue as well as the battery dying very quickly has completely disappeared.  We have both the iProducts and Androids in our house and I can honestly say this is not the same build quality that an iProduct is, but I also don't like the restrictions the iProducts have and the features this little product has outshines those in my opinion.  Would I pay full retail for this device, NO. But at the price I was able to find for this one, I would do it again."}

As usual Samsung's multitasking modification for the Android OS is a plus and the Spen is truly innovative. The screen is extremely responsive to the Spen and I have never had any trouble with this particular feature. In my opinion I feel that this tablet is a bit underpowered and can get sluggish at times if you have too many open applications which I feel is under par for the price range. Also the screen resolution for the price range is horrid. I really do not know what Samsung was thinking when they decided to go with this screen. The battery life is also less than optimal and I always bring a spare charger along so I can get a long day out of it. Despite these three things it is a good Tablet but I wouldn't purchase it for more than 150-180 bills."}

Coupled with the Fintie Case Cover ($15), you can set it upright at two different angles in widescreen mode. Closing the cover puts the Note to sleep and opening the cover wakes it up.\n\nThe touch screen is responsive yet forgiving of accidental touches.\n\nIt's fast. Cold boot is quick, and return from sleep is nearly instantaneous. I do a lot of multitasking and browsing with multiple open tabs. I was worried that it would slow down with all that information in RAM, but everything loads quickly. WiFi performance is great - better than my laptop, in fact.\n\nYou can set a password, a PIN, or a pattern for security. I like choices!\n\nThe three buttons - home, back, and menu - are very handy shortcuts. Press and hold the home button and it shows all open applications, making task switching very easy. (I discovered that by accident. Maybe it's in the manual, but I haven't read the manual yet!)\n\nVolume control is easy to reach, and the sound is decent, although I haven't used it to listen to music (that's not why I bought it.)\n\nIts USB cable allows you to plug it into a computer for easy file transfers, and the same cable also plugs into the AC adapter for charging. (I'm assuming you can charge it just by plugging it into a computer's USB port while the computer is on, but I haven't tried that.\n\nNote-taking with the stylus is pretty good too. I haven't used it a lot, but it seems intuitive. The notepad application lets you draw \"sloppy\" objects (everything I draw is sloppy) and it turns them into perfect shapes. Handwriting recognition works well - you can convert handwriting into text.\n\nCons:\n\nI'm bummed that the built-in calendar app doesn't sync with Google calendar in both directions. No big deal - just install the Google calendar and don't use the built in one.\n\nThe screen has an auto-brightness control and manual control options. Normally I want it on auto, and that works for most conditions. I've had a couple of times when the display was too bright, so I switched to manual and adjusted it myself. That's fine, but I'd like a shortcut to just the brightness setting. It doesn't have that. It has a \"favorite settings\" widget, but that takes up the entire home screen. Good thing there are five home screens, but still.\n\nThe cons are minor irritations. The pros make it worth buying. I recommend it!"}

I only wish it was easier to find covers for this without magnetic awaken/sleep features.  I have found very few limitations from using this when I can't get to a laptop.  The s-pen makes a great substitute mouse when using hover menus you can not use on a normal tablet."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I purchased a used Samsung Galaxy Note 8 from Ocean Reef Electronics, but it looks brand new, and has excellent battery life. Buying it used meant it was much cheaper than retail, so I'm extra happy with it. It's always a gamble to get a used product online, but I was pleasantly surprised that it barely had a scratch, and seems to be in perfect working order.\n\nThe used Note 8 from Ocean Reef did not ship with any Samsung product box or documentation - it only included the actual Note and a charger (likely not from Samsung). I'll probably get a different charger, as the one that came with the tablet from Ocean Reef is quite short, and has equal sized prongs (ungrounded/unpolarized NEMA 1-15 plug) on the charger, so sometimes the plug falls out of the electrical socket while charging.\n\nBut the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 itself is awesome - and I was happy it didn't look used, even though it was sold as used."}

I thought it was a manufacture defect and sent it back to Samsung - nope! I was told by the director of my University Technology - it is no iPad or any APPLE tablet in terms of battery time. That is why I gave it 3 versus more stars. Android is great OS, and it does take getting use to compared to my iOS, but not very steep a learning curve. Samsung - improve the battery life and I'll be loyal like I am to APPLE..."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "This is one of the best tablets out there - better than an ipad, and it does more. The Note 8 includes an IR blaster, GPS, and the S-Pen in addition to all the sensors and features you find on an ipad. The ipad doesn't have any of those. Android also has a larger installed user base than apple so there are plenty of aps both free and paid. The camera's on the Note 8 are excellent and the speakers are pretty incredible too. You won't believe how good they sound for such small speakers. Of course I use earphones to listen to music with the Note 8, but if I want to share something I play it through the speakers and when people first hear how good they are it floors them. Looking at a photo you just took on the large screen is nice too, and the cameras make using Skype a breeeze with great audio and video.\n\nIf you use an android phone, you can sync all your data between your phone and your note. My calendar is always up to date as is my contact list. Many of the third party aps will sync across devices as well. I use my Note 8 for everything - calendar, recipes, shopping lists, to do lists, woodworking plans, drawings and painting. For example if you were measuring a window for shades, you'd probably draw the window and put in your measurements. With the Note 8 I take a picture of the window, drop it into Notepad and draw in the measurements right on the picture!\n\nThat is how I use my Note 8 and I've had it for about one year. This review is actually for my wife's Note 8 that I just bought her for Christmas. She was so jealous of all the things I could do with my Note that she wanted one herself. Now she has one."}

The multiwindow view is really terrific as well.\n\nThe flaws: battery life really is lousy. My S-Pen hover scrolling stopped working in some apps after the KitKat update.

There are a few things that I like and don't like so I'll do my best to break them down in a pros and cons list:\n\nPros:\n-The stylus is the whole reason why I chose this table and I love it. There are no delays or stutters and it's very smooth.\n-Lightweight\n-Syncing - I have an HTC Android phone and this device syncs beautifully with my calendar and other Google apps. between the two. This brings me to my next Pro...\n-The HD Note app (which I think use to be called S Note before one of the updates). You can create and sort lists but still have them synced to you S Note Calendar. This feature makes me want to get a Samsung Note phone so that I can sync it between the two!\n-Streaming. No issues with buffering or anything. Not even after updates to the device or the app. Very nice.\n-Customization - Everything from wallpaper to fonts. It's so simple to make it your own.\n-Flipboard - Very cool app for catching up on current events that fit your interests.\n\nCons:\n-Case options - I can't find a single case that I like due to ONE thing that has been an issue which is my next Con..\n-The \"home\" button at the bottom. I cannot tell you how many times I here the voice command come on in my purse because even with a case the button is getting pushed and trying to perform a task. It's too bad that it's not an \"inset\" button like on the iPad. It doesn't matter how I change it's placement or get a new cover, it ALWAYS manages to get bumped multiple times. Annoying.\n-Camera - It's not bad but my phone has a better megapixel. I have done some video but it just seems too bulky to do any of that anyway than just using my phone.\n\nThat's all I can think of off the top of my head. I'll be sticking with this device as long as technology allows me."}

Really its limitations are more with the drawing programs that are currently available for android.\n\nOutside of its artistic capabilities, its still great. The one big issue I have with it is that it comes LOADED with useless trashware apps that cant be permanently deleted.

What drew me to this tablet, was the S pen component. And let me tell you, an S pen changes everything. I have to write a lot in my work, I'm also a note taker, I keep journals, I collect and gather information of all sorts. This tablet does it all. I use the built in S Note app and have already created over twenty notebooks full of information. Writing with the S pen using the swipe keyboard feels natural and easy to my hand. No attachment of keyboard necessary, the S pen is all you need to create beautiful documents. The pen also has this awesome feature that allows you to cut, crop, and save anything on the screen across the web or your books. Writing on the screen becomes enormously handy when using the calendar. The widgets rock,  I love diversity they offer. The 8.0 size is near perfect. I travel extensively and it slips into my purse effortlessly.  I still own an iPhone, but when it comes to a productivity tablet, I don't believe anything on the market comes close to the Note 8.0.  I have three college students and an Apple loving husband and they are all switching over to the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0."}

I have not found a galaxy note tablet tutorial on my note, thus I have to resort to using youtube to look for tips and tricks.  The only thing that I could say being critical is that the power button is on the same side and above the volume button, I often hit the power off when I am trying to increase the volume.  Just being picky... I guess."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I bought myself this tablet because I'm in graduate school and needed to keep up with the technology. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS LITTLE MACHINE! I went with Samsung because I have had a Samsung cell phone since I was 18 (so roughly 7 years), and I know it to be a great brand. I could have gone with the regular tablet, but decided to go with the Note because of that S-Pen that everyone was raving about. Best idea ever. I have to read a lot of PDF documents and the S-pen is extremely handy with highlighting and making notes in the document. I no longer print off anything because I can get the same experience on this tablet as I can looking at a paper copy. I have also stopped buying physical books because this tablet is wonderful to read off of.\n\nAs for the size, the 8 inch screen is perfect. I was concerned about getting a smaller tablet because I guess I didn't think I would get the same experience out of it or something equally asinine as that. This tablet is easy to fit into a purse, so I can carry it with me anywhere (or to work).\n\nHonestly, I use the tablet more than my laptop, anymore. I can do virtually the same things without having to wait a while for it to boot up. The screen is very clear, and it looks very sleek. I've had it for about 9 months now, but it's as if it is brand new. My favorite thing about it is that I don't have to get things in print anymore, I can even write out my to-do lists, in my own writing, and mark things off as I go!"}

The stylus makes things a lot easier and the innovation they had with it adds to it.  One of the reasons why I bought the Note 8 and want to buy the Note 3/4 is because it has a place for the stylus inside the case instead of having to carry one loose in your pocket/bag/container.  It has plenty of computing power and is excellent for doing everything short of word processing (unless you have a full size Bluetooth keyboard that you don't plan on taking with you everywhere) and going to websites with Flash content.  I realized that I use my S4 and tablet more than I ever use my laptop.  Having a Samsung phone makes things a lot easier with transferring data between phone and tablet and using the tablet is almost exactly like using my phone.  It's a great tablet that I would recommend to everyone who is an Android fan."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I am updating my review because the problem was solved by contacting Samsung Care. First, my device is still under the one-year warranty. The problem was my tablet's Multi Window was disabled. And there was no way it would be enabled unless it was completely reset up. This would wipe out everything I saved in it. The rep was very nice who understood immediately what could be done to save all my files before the reset up. I was transferred to someone who obviously performed the task from another country. She was very impatient with me. She quickly told me that unfortunately my tablet did not have this function. I told her I paid a lot more for the newest edition for the S Pen and multi window. It got to have this function. I insisted her do the remote back up of my files and then reset the tablet up. She sounded so impatient even though it took her only a few minutes to finish the task. The end result was good. I started my tablet all over just like when I first got it. I turned on the multi window button. And it worked!\n\nFYI, the below is my old review. I hope it will help if anyone experiences the same problem.\n\nI like the size and the good quality pictures of this Galaxy Note 8.0. Since I am not fast in figuring out some of the new features of this device, I have to wait for someone to show me how to use those features. I spent so much time trying to get the Multi Window work, it never worked, no matter how many times I watched the videos showing how to use it. I waited for almost 8 months until my niece showed me that the Multi Window can not work on my device. The key for this function won't be turned on. Basically, I spent much more money on this top tablet for one of the coolest features, but got it a default problem from manufacturer. I need to find out how long the warranty covers."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I had problems with this tablet when I first started using it. It crashed a lot and seemed to feel overloaded and can't handle some apps. The pen didn't last long either with normal use, but I had it replaced after much hassle with the 'techie' guy, so I was connected to Samsung Corporate Office, which sent me a new pen.\n\nThen, something weird happened while I was at LAX airport... suddenly windows popped up from nowhere (like mirroring whatever I'm presently on... like one window, then smaller window inside it, then a much smaller window inside the smaller window, and so on and so forth, until infinity). They were just there blocking everything I was on and resembling everything on my browser. I couldn't work anymore cause it was blocking my artwork, my sketches and my writings and mimicking everything I was doing a million times over.\n\nI contacted Samsung, but no reply. I messaged them on facebook with the image attachment... still no reply from them. I had no choice anymore... either to return it to Amazon for refund or reset the whole 'dang' thing!!! No one could fixed it, even the guy I met who was a computer programmer. He said he had never seen anything like it in his whole career. I also went to a techie guy in Studio City... said the same thing that it was weird and have never seen anything like it. So, it's no wonder Samsung didn't respond at all (maybe they have no clue how to fix the \"monster\" they may have created).\n\nI wrote down all the apps I installed and some of them I paid for. The programmer guy told me not to reset it, and I didn't want to reset it either, cause that might not fix the problem and I'll lose my apps, my 'moolah' and still be stuck with the creepy stuffs lurking inside my tablet. Returning it to Amazon might also become a big issue, because I had it for awhile, plus I needed to use the tablet everyday and not wait... and so I RESET IT AFTER DWELLING ON IT FOR DAYS!\n\nBoy am I glad I reset it! Why? Because, those creepy thingies went away and my Galaxy had been running smoothly ever since. Although, I lost many of my apps and what I paid for, but after explaining the issue to google play, they refunded me most of my money, so I bought the apps again."}

This features seems to work most efficiently with the EZ PDF reader pro app. IT is the only one that I have found that makes use of the pen effectively. However, at times I would like to download the e-book. That app and the pen do not work well with e-books. The pen does not work with Google Play books either.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I've had my Note 8 for almost a year and love all the features and convienences it has over the ipad mini, in particular, the micro SD card slot ( the main selling point for me). The display is bright and very sharp though the auto-dim makes it a little too dim, for my eyes anyway. Speed and responsiveness is for the most part ok, but it does lag a bit at times. The two BIGGEST complaints I have with this tablet is that you can only use it if the battery is charged, even with the AC adapter plugged in, and the battery life is pretty poor (about 3-4 hrs for me). The AC adapter can not charge the battery and keep the tablet running at the same time. Also, with the tablet turned off and charging, it takes about 12 hrs to fully charge. With the tablet in \"standby\", it takes almost 24 hrs. I've gone to Samsung support about this issue twice and all they've done was replace the USB cable twice and tell me to keep the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned off because they put a big load on the battery. Kind of defeats the whole purpose of having a tablet I think. And yes, I've tried a different AC adapter, twice. So, bottom line, though I really hate to do it, I may have to go to the dark side and replace my Samsung with an (shutter!) IPad mini. At least it can pat it's head and rub it's stomach at the same time (charge the battery and run the tablet, lol). Almost Samsung, almost, but not quite there yet.\n\n*Update 3/2015\nAfter being let down by Samsung's service center, I decided to see if I could fix the charging issue on my own. With so many good reviews on this tablet, my particular one had to be a defective unit. Since I've tried several USB cables and chargers without luck, the next item to try was the micro USB connector in the tablet itself. I noticed that if I wiggled the USB cable, the charging indicator would come and go (not sure why Samsung service didn't notice this). I found a YouTube video that showed how to open the tablet without damage and that the micro USB connector is a separate module which is replaceable. So I found a replacement module from an online seller for $8.00 and replaced the (hopefully) defective one in the tablet. The new module appears to be updated with a metal reinforced contact support within the micro USB connector. The USB cable now plugs in tightly and is very secure. Previously, the cable would fall out if I picked up the tablet (not sure why Samsung service didn't notice this). The tablet now works perfectly! Unlike before, it charges fast and is able to stay charged with the charger plugged-in even with the tablet running processor intensive apps. Gave only 4 stars because I was left on my own to troubleshoot and repair my tablet."}

My tablet is the only means I have of accessing my textbook, so by the time I got it or a new one back (if I got it back) I would have failed my summer program.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I first ordered one of these tablets (of a different color) for my mother for Christmas.  I wound up picking out what I would have purchased for myself if I were to buy a tablet for myself at the time. After I became more familiar with her tablet's features I determined that I could no longer put off purchasing a Galaxy Note tablet for myself. She had been using hers for over 4 months, with no issues, before I ordered mine about 3 months ago. She has still not had any issues.\n\nI have had my tablet for nearly 3 months and it has worked great.  It currently find myself using this device a lot at work to scribble down notes when I am doing IT work on computers. Before I used it at work I had purchased it with the intention of using it for lists and notes that would otherwise be scattered about the house.  Now I can keep them in one place without having to worry about running out of pages or picking up the wrong notepad.\nThe added stylus is great tool. It is extremely handy if you like to take screenshots of pages or applications that you are working in at the time. I am able to fit the tablet into the cargo pocket of the shorts or pants that I am wearing and take it on the go. That would not be possible with a 10\" tablet. I use an Otter Box case and it still fits into my cargo pockets just fine.\nMy most used application is S Note, and it comes preloaded on the tablet. The application is designed to work with the S Pen and it works well. The S Pen is more than just a stylus, and in fact isn't a normal stylus. It cannot be used on other touch screen devices that are not designed to use the S Pen. There is a slot in the side of the tablet which can hold the S Pen securely when not in use. Stowing the S Pen away can also save some battery life because the tablet uses energy to detect the S Pen. The power used to detect the pen seems somewhat negligible, but I like to put the pen quickly away when I am not using it so that I don't lose the pen.\nIf my tablet were lost or destroyed, I would not replace it with a tablet that used only a normal stylus. I use this tablet nearly every day."}

Only reason for replacement was to upgrade (gave the Nexus to our daughter which she is still using). After 3 months (in a case) my wife took the note out of her purse and noticed a thumb size black spot n the screen. Within a day it had grown to a 2 \" wide black line across the entire width of the screen. I uploaded the issue on Samsung's web site (with images) and received a call (which I missed) the next day. I returned the call (to the number that was left)and got a machine so I left a message. After 2 days of no return call I called Samsung's 800 number and spoke to a nice lady who gave me the return info. She also stressed that I should have the piece \"professionally\" packaged by UPS to ensure no shipping damage (which I did). She was very understanding and led me to believe that my issue would be warranted. After 5 business days the tablet was received at the service center and on the sixth day I received a call (which I missed) and had a garbled barely legible message stating that the issue with my tablet would not be covered due to customer damage. Now the fun begins, I call the number back (2 minutes after the missed call) and get and all circuits busy signal on their end, I call back 10 minutes later and got a machine on which I leave a message and I call back again one hour later and leave another message. I then call Samsung's 800 number and am given to their escalated service department and speak to a very apologetic woman who merely reads me the report. I cannot understand how a tablet can have internal damage without a blemish on the outside. She continually tells me she is not a tech, but they are standing behind what their servicer reports. I request a photo showing any kind of external damage that would result in an internal screen error and am told the servicer is closed and I need to call them back the next day. Long story short, I convinced the lady to email my request to the service center and ended the 1 1/2 hour conversation. The next day at around 11:00 I call the servicer and again get a machine and leave a message, I repeat this process 2 more times during the day and that evening when I had not received the images or a return call I called Samsung and was told that the images had not been uploaded and was given another number for the servicer. When I called them I was told they were uploaded and I could log on to the service site and view them. Needless to say there were no pictures so back I go to Samsung. On this call I am connected to a woman who again apologizes an awful lot, but does nothing, in fact she tells me that yes the images were uploaded, but they were loaded to the wrong account and are proprietary between them and the service center and I cannot see them. All she wanted to do was set up a UPS claim. When I request to speak to a supervisor I was told there are none available and I asked to wait. After one hour and twenty minutes of holding a supervisor comes on the line and we spend twenty minutes going round and round with him telling me the same proprietary story I just heard (after his department made the original request for me). He continually states that Samsung WILL NOT REVERSE the service centers decision (when I never one requested this, all I requested was to see an image showing some kind of external damage that could lead to the issue I was having). He finally put me on hold and spoke to someone at the Service center (this was over an hour later than the previous night when they were \"closed\") and requested I be sent an image of the external damage. The next day I did receive an image and it was basically an exact blurry duplicate of the original image I sent with the service request. No sign of external damage, no bump, no crack, no bruise. Later that same day the supervisor called me to inform me the same thing he had stated numerous time the evening before \" SAMSUNG WILL NOT REVERSE THE DECISION OF THE SERVICE COMPANY\", like I didn't see that coming. This was undoubtedly the absolute worst customer service I have ever received in my entire life. Samsung and their service center have no concern for their customers and apparently believe that what ever they say goes and have no burden of proof on their end. THIS WAS THE FIRST SAMSUNG PRODUCT I HAD PURCHASED AND WILL DEFENITLY BE THE LAST!!!!!"}

I briefly considered rooting the device and installing custom firmware myself, but the whole point of purchasing the Note 8 was taking advantage of Samsung's optimizations with the stylus, so I decided to just return the device.\n\nI should have known better. Samsung software never lives up to my standards."}

I did extensive research for tablets with stylus support, even looked at the iPad mini and the Evernote stylus, but was not convince with the amount of apps designed for stylus support. I also did not want to get locked into using just Evernote on the iPad. With the Note 8.0 I have the capability to take written notes using various note taking apps.\n\nI would definitely recommend this tablet for anyone who takes notes and needs that ability to share them. This is not your average tablet, it's mostly aimed folks who take notes, draw, sketch, color and so on and so on.\n\nIf you are looking for an average tablet for casual internet browsing or checking e-mail, I would recommend getting a tablet like a Nexus 7 or a Samsung Tab."}

Perhaps there is a way to trim this, we'll see. More onboard storage gives me more confidence to locally store the 2GB of important documents that I need access to. The device also features the expandable mini SD, so I have plenty of space for media.\nThe 8 inch screen makes a nice difference on viewing movies, playing the Tower Defense games that I enjoy, and even in the viewing of .doc or .pdf files. The S-Pen has become my primary mode for data entry and I use the tablet for all of my meetings and note-taking, it is that effective. I also author blog posts using the S-Pen.\n\nOverall, two BIG thumbs up on this device."}

I really enjoy the writing and pen feature of the device, but the battery life and the overall performance of the device makes me jealous of others that are at work who mainly have ipads or ipad mini's.  The overall user experience is a bit choppy.  Some apps that exist on both ipad and android tablets work smoother and faster on my colleagues' ipads (accessing hospital electronic medical records), and there just seems to be more support for the ipad versions of things than android.  This isn't a knock on all things android.  I like my device and plan to continue to purchase android devices (probably beyond Samsung now).  I just wish this device were snappier and the battery performance were better.  To give an example of the battery being poor, I've once unplugged my device at 6am after charging overnight, and by 10am, the battery was in the red after using the pen to write some notes for about 2 hours at 50% brightness.  It's a weird issue because it doesn't always happen, but does occur occasionally.\n\nThe overall feel that I'm getting with this device is like when I first bought a Galaxy S1 (Verizon Fascinate) and felt that it lagged behind the iphone version at that time but after upgrading to the Galaxy S3, the device felt much improved and much more on-par with the iphone version at the time of the S3 release."}

Laptop too big and bulky for personal travel.  Using an Android or I phone overseas is expensive due to roaming fees, but with a tablet you just need a WiFi connection, which are generally free.  So a tablet is perfect for travel. The 8.0\" Note is the perfect size for travel also ... the 10 and 12\" sizes would be too big and bulky.\nIt didn't take long to get the tab setup for my email account, homepage, and other apps I use on my laptop ... just a bit of learning curve.  Once I was setup,  I found that the tablet was a great substitute for my laptop with mobility in my house and outside wherever WIFI is available. When I was doing research for the tablet, I ran into a IT guy at a computer store who said he uses his tablet much more than his laptop when he's on off site location, which is what I am finding.

It is plenty powerful enough for my purposes - browsing the internet, watching youtube, listening to music while multitasking, all that jazz. Samsung's software also blows away that of any other smart device I've used. The full-fledged toolbar in the notification drawer is a godsend and makes multitasking very easy. I love the stylus to death. I would never purchase a tablet without a feature like the S-pen after being spoiled by it. The tablet is a little inconsistent on the precision of tapping with the pen - usually it taps right where you want it to, but sometimes it is a pain. At any rate, the pen draws very smoothly. My only complaint is I wish the Multi-Window feature supported more apps. Not even Google Drive is supported, which is a huge bummer for me since I use that app more than most. Hopefully in the near future Drive and Firefox will join the list of apps supported."}

I write, it converts to text directly into the story file I'm working on, and every time I hit save, it's uploaded to my Dropbox.\n\nThat's all I wanted it for: a dedicated writing device. It's perfect for the job, not too big or heavy, and not so small that it's difficult to write on the screen.\n\nI do have a few songs loaded on it, so that I can listen to music while writing, and the sound's really good for such a device.\n\nThe cons are few, and the main one would be all the dang pre-installed apps that you can't delete. I intensely dislike having stuff on my devices I'm never going to use, and would rather have the storage space free. However, I've grown accustomed to it on my phone, so I guess I'll do the same for my tablet.\n\nThe other con is the size of the stylus. I realize it's made to fit in the tablet, but you'd think a tool meant for frequent usage would be designed to be more comfy to hold and use for long periods of time. It's not, so you may have to take frequent breaks to stretch your hand. The solution is to buy a \"cover\" that converts the stylus to regular pen size (which I've done).\n\nAll in all, I'm extremely pleased with my purchase of this tablet, and am looking forward to using it for a long time."}

My biggest complaint about the tablet is my main complaint for all android devices.  They rarely get updated to new versions of the OS.  This one is already 2 versions out of date since it still only supports Jelly Bean.  Samsung only releases updates for their devices if it adds a feature that benefits them such as to support their worthless Galaxy Gear Watch.  My other complaint is each model has a different interface.  Makes using them complicated as no 2 are alike.  Samsung puts too many custom interfaces into Android and doesn't implement them across the board or update previous models with the new OS settings.\n\nWhile the tablet is excellent and great for the short term don't plan on it lasting for more than 2 years and it having no resale value at that time since it never gets updates.  I don't really like iPads but they have much longer life spans as they get yearly updates across the board."}

I like and prefer the customizable platform that Android offers and there are so many free apps available.  Basically any app that is available to for iOS is available for Android.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "Although I was hoping for an product refresh to bring the Note 8 up to the \"Note 10.1 2014\" spec range, I didn't see that coming from Samsung any time soon.. so I purchased the current model.  This was an afterthought to an ongoing adventure with the to-date miserable Dell Venue Pro 8 stylus*.  The Note 8 will update itself to Android 4.2.2, which is good news.  And although it appears only the 16GB version is out there now (at least in Wifi only) you do have the option to install apps to the MicroSD card.  The 8\" form factor is, in my opinion, a better size for note taking with the pen than a 10\" or 12\" tablet, although they are likely preferred for those with artistic tendencies.  This will be a productivity tablet for me.  Using Papyrus and the included S-note, I am very happy with this device.  It is a touch tablet until you need the pen, and a pen tablet when you want to take a note.\n\nThe limitations of no native pen support in either Evernote or Onenote is disappointing, but not a show stopper for me.  Several pen apps will export or sync to Evernote, although so far I have found that integration is not as tight as you might hope.  But, Samsung did a very, very good job of the pen implementation here and if you are going to look to the tablet more than you look for what the tablet sends to your laptop, this is your device.\n\nThe screen resolution spec is on the low side, but it is not noticeable.  I have found that in these 7-8 inch tablets, high end resolution specs may be overkill at least in everyday productivity tasks.  Comparing an iPad Retina, Venue Pro 8, and Nexus 7 2013 the only practical difference I see is screen brightness, rather than resolution.  Basically, I can illuminate a large room with the Dell or Nexus, but all are acceptable in normal usage.  Outdoors, you will favor the Dell or the Nexus.  So basically no complaints about the screen at all but I wouldn't mind a brighter one.\n\nSo my conclusion here, if you need a pen-input productivity tablet and are happy keeping most of the information \"on tablet\" don't hesitate.  If you need Onenote with pen input, go look at the Asus Vivotab and the Windows world, or anticipate the hoped for \"Surface Mini\" later in 2014.\n\n-------------------------\n*Update on Dell Venue Pro 8.  Dell, without any request from me, send me a new revision active stylus.  Bravo Dell. The new version seems very usable with onenote, although it is a step down from the s-pen as expected.  As to the Samsung Note 8... I love it.  I have owned productivity devices since Newton, and this is probably the tops."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "Since I love my Galaxy Note 2 (and I am an S Pen user), I wanted my next tablet to be a Note 8.0. A factory refurb for under $200 sealed the deal. I was disappointed that the 8.0 did not have some of the simple features of my Note 2:  No LED notification light when you have a message/email/etc.; no S pen keeper which sounds an alert and shows a pop up when you walk away with your device without attaching the S Pen; none of the cool writing features where, for example you make a written mistake and you can cross a line through it to delete the text or draw a line between letters to make a space. On the 8, you have to erase the entire word using the back button.  Also, the S Pen on the 2 pops out easily when you push it; the 8 requires you to really dig it out of its hole! Perhaps most of this can be fixed with a simple Android version upgrade (mine is 4.2.2)\n\nThe good stuff:  Unlike the Note 2, the S Pen does work with the settings and return buttons at the bottom of the tablet (on the Note 2, you have to press it with your finger which is a pain with pen in hand).  The S Pen is slightly longer on the 8.0 which makes it easier to write.  The larger space to write has really helped my accuracy. and has me more interested in S Notes. It boots up quickly and is very responsive.  The size is perfect for portability (though a tad heavier than I anticipated) particularly for using the pen while holding it. The picture is sharp though I am still prefer my Kindle book when reading books.\n\nOverall I am very happy with the tablet and I hope the next Android  software upgrade will bring some of the features I love in my Note 2."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "It's probably the one of the smallest tablets out there that has a Wacom digitizer.  I personally felt like I should have gotten one with a larger screen (like the Note 10.1), since I'm physics student.  The writing is not as precise as pencil on paper, nor as fast (it has a small but noticeably latency).  My best analogy would be that the precision is somewhere between a sharpy and a ball pen.  Still, it allows me to save paper.  If you want a tablet for drawing, you might want something larger too, unless it's just for fun.\n\nStill, I reckon the small size of the tablet has its perks.  Its battery size is half that of the 10.1, and the battery life is only a few hours shorter.  So while it might not last you as long on a full charge, it takes less time to charge it.  Usually an hour or two is enough to get the Note 8 from almost 0% to 100% battery life.  You get more battery life per hour spent charging it compared to larger, battery hungry tablets.\n\nFor the purposes of keeping memos, however, it's pretty awesome.  Everything is digital, so you don't have to worry about having a mess of disorganized flash cards or post-its around your desk.  Cutting and pasting is not that smooth, but possible.\n\nThe Android OS is iffy.  While it's a nice combat OS that allows widget customization and multiple pages for your home screen, it lacks the same productivity as a Windows (especially if you're used to Windows).  You'll probably have to go out of your way to find apps that allow you to convert one file type to another.  Some apps won't even allow you options to open from, or save to a directory, but rather require you to \"share\" it via Google Drive or some other method.  Organizing files is certainly less efficient because of this.  You'll also have to go out of your way to find apps (sometimes pay for apps) to allow the same functionality that you can get for free on Windows, like writing programs in C++, and the capabilities will still be limited (console applications).  It does come with Polaris Office, which allows you to create document, spreadsheet, and presentation files, albeit with derpy compatibility with MS Office.  Sometimes symbols come out wrong, or the formatting is not conserved.\n\nThe tablet screen, imo, is large enough to view full web pages (as opposed to mobile versions of the same pages), since it does have pretty good resolution.  Plus you can always zoom in if things are hard to see).  However, you'll have to go out of your way to make Youtube videos work on Desktop mode.\n\nFor the Note 8 - No support for Java.  No gyroscope.  No flash (for taking pictures).  :(\nThe back camera protrudes out from the back surface.  Solution - get a case.\nThe IR blaster sucks (my TV won't detect it).\nThe GPS is hard to use (Google Maps requires online connectivity, so either save an area of your map for offline use, or get an SMS version of the Tablet).  There are navigation apps, but the free open source ones have missing streets, while the more complete ones will cost you.  I've personally stuck to using a dedicated GPS device.\n\nThere is a slot for micro-SD card.  You can also buy an on-the-go device to connect the micro-USB port (same port for charging) of this tablet to a USB flash drive, or SD card.  :)\n\nThe bottom line is it's a great tablet for the price.  It does everything that any other Android tablet does (with the exception of serious gaming) and has an S-pen.  The screen size may not be ideal for doing math problems or more advanced art projects, but it gets the job done.  A lot of the neat features (Java, Gyro, Camera Flash) aren't present, but the tablet is compact and has a quick battery charge time (though not necessarily life, but enough to last you about a day per charge).  It does give you the Office capabilities, but specifically for spreadsheets, I much prefer working on Excel on a laptop or computer with a mouse (and a larger screen)."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I just love this tablet so much I have to write a review on it. Due to (and some provided by) my job, I have an ipod, ipad, a windows laptop, a macbook pro, and only recently I've gotten into android products, and I have to say that I love the openness of android.\n\nFirst of all, when I got the note 8.0, I have to say I both loved and mostly hated it; hated it because of all the bloatware and useless (to me) apps that Samsung puts on the tablet; I loved it because of the wacom pen, which is very precise. Moreover, you can use ANY wacom tablet pen with the tablet, not just the small pen that comes with the note. I use a very nice wacom pen from an old Fujitsu tablet pc. I have the Wacom \"Penabled Tablet Pc Eraser Pen\" which is nice as well and is large almost like a regular pencil. The pen can easily be used to take notes in class, especially with LectureNotes (which I used on a daily basis).\n\nTo get rid of the bloatware, you can get an app called Clean Master from the android app store and if you open it up and go to app manager, you can disable (not uninstall) all the useless preinstalled apps (there is a category that says \"completely safe to disable apps\" and you just disable them, one after another). Of course, you can also go to app manager and do the same, but Clean Master makes it so easy. This is OK and it left a fairly nice tablet without a lot of the bloatware.\n\nHowever, I ended up voiding the warranty because I rooted the note 8.0, then I installed a custom recovery (Philz touch), then I installed cyanogenmod 11. Now I have to say that I absolutely love the note 8.0; it's my favorite computer. The wacom pen works perfectly, and the tablet is 100% pure with no traces of bloatware whatsoever and it runs smooth as silk. (The original Samsang had over 50% of the ram being used even without installed apps running, while with cyanogenmod 11, only 17% is used.)\n\nI would have never written this review, except that I did install the custom ROM (cyanogenmod 11) and the Samsung works like the dream tablet I've always wanted. Without installing the custom rom, I would give the note 8.0 a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 because of the bloatware."}

Having the ability to write my notes is much more intuitive to me that to hunt and peck at an on screen keyboard.  But, all the capacitive stylus hardware and software I have tried is crude and inaccurate. Basically a waste of time.  So I thought I'd give the Galaxy Note a try.  I have always wondered why, if Palm could make it work (albeit with a shorthand language) 15 years ago, why couldn't someone make it work really well today, given the advances in software and processing power.  Well, Samsung seems to have done just that.  So while in other respects this tablet is really not noticeably different than other 7/8 inch tablets, for me, the pen really makes a difference.\n\nSo why only 4 starts?  First, I reserve 5 for near perfect only, and this is great, but has a couple issues:  1) the smooth glossy back. It may look pretty, but it doesn't give much grip. I prefer my (now given away) Nexus 7 in that regard.  2) the size - while 8 inch does give noticeably more screen size, it goes from being easily hand held, to marginal - really a bit big for long term holding.  I don't have huge hands, but their not tiny either - probably average to slightly large for men. I could see this bordering on being a two hand device for women.  Again, I prefer the 7\" nexus in this regard.\n\nBut in the end, the pen makes the difference. And as I bought this as a refurbished unit, at a deep discount - total price close to new \"normal\" tablets, I am quite happy."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "The main reason l chose this tablet was for the handwriting recognition, which is much better than I expected. There are times that I get to writing quickly and sloppily and l think, \"I can't even read that- no way it can.'' And about half the time, it pops up the correct word. It reads both print and cursive, as well as combinations thereof. My only complaint is that it has a tendency to capitalize c, s, and m at the beginning of words. (By the way, this was written on my Note. Much more efficient than typing on it.)\n\nApart from that, it's about what I expected. Beautiful screen, quick responses. Big enough for easy reading, but still comfortable to hold. I do wish the split screen functionality worked with more apps, but it does well with the ones it has. Battery life is great, and it can get me through the day without needing to find an outlet. I've been getting 11-14 hours of moderate to heavy use out of it.\n\nI usually like to point out the cons, but there really aren't many here. l would appreciate the ability to turn off touch input when the pen is out, and it does come with a lot of Samsung bloatware, but that's to be expected when buying Samsung. Some of the preloaded apps are great, such as Awesome Note (which to my surprise, turned out to be truly awesome), while others are merely annoying and useless (hello, S Voice).

I waffled back and forth because it seemed self indulgent to purchase another tablet so soon.  Then I caught a good deal on a Black Friday promotion and took the plunge.  I am so glad I did.\n\nThe S-Pen really is worth it.  I tried after market styluses with both my Tab and my Ipad and they didn't have the precision (these devices also lack the digital layer that enables the S-Pen to function).  My work requires that I read and mark up PDF documents on a frequent basis.  Being able to do this with the S-Pen turns a chore into something resembling a pleasure.  The S-Pen is very accurate and my notes are legible.\n\nOther improvements over the tab are a slimmer profile device, a MUCH longer battery life, and a better screen.  It is fast enough for my needs.  I also appreciate the expansion slot so memory can be added economically.  The big apple gouges a bit for extra memory, IMO\n\nIf I were looking for a tablet for fun and leisure, I'd go for an ipad because of the more intuitive operating system and the greater array of apps, and for streaming digital content.  However, if you want to use a tablet for work as well as play, I don't think you can beat the Samsung Note series of tablets.  The multi-screen capability (while limited) is another big plus.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I got the Note 8.0 to replace my aging Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus. What a difference! The note is fast, fast, fast. I like the little bit larger size. The WiFi is faster and stronger on the Note. With a 64Gb Micro SD card I've got plenty of storage space. I use ES Task Manager to regularly kill unused background processes and keep unused interfaces such as GPS turned off unless I need them. With these measures I get nearly two days of moderate to heavy use between battery charges. And the battery charges very rapidly. This is nowhere near the usage I get with my iPad with it's huge battery. But for an Android tablet it's quite good. I don't use the S-Pen. But clearly the screen is designed for accurate touch translation. It's much easier to use the onscreen keyboard than with my other Android devices. The touch sensor is more accurate so I get fewer inaccurate keystrokes. For any serious typing I use my foldable bluetooth keyboard and bluetooth mouse. They both connect quickly and respond well. I had to fight to get a connection sometimes with the Galaxy Tab, but not with the Note. The onscreen keyboard doesn't disappear automatically with connection of the bluetooth keyboard. You have to hit the Back key. But this is an issue with the Galaxy Tab also. It's not as smooth as is the iPad which automatically responds and retracts the onscreen keyboard upon bluetooth connection. I use an Anker portable stand with either of the tablets, and even with my Kindle. With these accessories and a Ballistic hard case on the back plus a VG nylon carrying case the Note is a great laptop replacement. I can download pictures from my Canon camera to the Note and then use my OnTheGo cable on the Note to send a second copy of my pictures to a flash drive. I'm able to keep my travel pictures safe with multiple copies. I can't do that with my iPad.\n\nI've very happy with this tablet. I use it every day to read the NYTimes, work with email, and read a library book in the Amazon Kindle app if my wife is using the Kindle. I get a good clear voice using Skype to talk with friends around the world. This one's a keeper."}

After getting a couple of Tab2 7.0 tablets for my wife and son last year, I began to consider a tablet upgrade for myself.  I purchased a Toshiba Thrive a couple of years ago and I enjoy it very much, but it was starting to look a lot slower next to these newer devices.  After some deliberation, I elected to go with the Note 8.0.  After several months of use, I am very pleased with my decision.  The slightly non-standard size of the Note 8.0 has made getting some accessories more challenging, but the device features make the trade off worth it for me.  The biggest draw and feature is of course, the S-Pen.  I have found it to be very versatile and helpful."}

I tried to just deal with because I used it for work and it was too much of an inconvenience to go without it for another 2 weeks.\n\nIt got so bad that I finally just sent it back again for repair two weeks ago. They called me twice to clarify the issue saying they couldn't find any problems after running a diagnostic test. They're now sending it back to me and the work order says no issues found.

I have two ipad minis at home and a Samsung Tab2 which is STILL relevant and keeping up with our requirements that include streaming video from our NAS, games, book reading, email/ browsing and media room remote.\nAnyway, bought for $200 bucks  refurbished. It came in, looks brand new, at power on it took me through the initial set up which is idiot proof  not sure I understand some of the reviews that claim they don't know how to get going on it (I should mention it did not come with a manual, it did come with a link to it which I have yet to feel the need to download), and then it was off to the races.\nSuper quick. Quicker than the minis and my Tab2 (which I guess is no surprise). Was not however, expecting it to be noticeably quicker than the minis thoughand it is.\nGreat size at 8 16:9 ratio. Movies fit real nice. Super wifi connectivity and speed (it actually tells you what your link speed is which I found cool). Image quality absolutely leaves the ipad minis behind, sharp, sharp and bright colors . The s pen is a really cool feature did not think I would care about it, but it feels like you are really writing /drawing with the sensitivity of the integrated Wacom digitizer.\nButton placement is fineI do tend to activate the menu button here and there on accident, but then again I seem to activate apps on the minis by accident as well so I guess it just doesnt bother me as much as some other reviewers.\nLOVE the fact that you can turn these puppies into a single remote for every room in the house. LOVE the sd card that you can load with 64 gb of whatever junk you like to carry in it ( loaded a couple movies an 40 gb of family pics (tablet has been in someones hands since I got it). Surprising from my girls whom I swore had the minis glued permanently to their hands.\nQuite happy so far but just got it this week-end. Will update in a few weeks and see if I am still enamored.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I've been looking for a tablet which matches a definition of a device where I can write notes freehand on the fly and have the notes reliably transcribed in a usable format. Unfortunately, I'm still looking, after having bought and experimented with the Samsung Note 8. I will update my review in the future as appropriate, but at this point, I'm not happy.\n\nUsing the S Note application with the S Pen for text recognition is an exercise in frustration. I tried writing a list in freehand, which would be transcribed into text. What I found was that it was difficult to fix transcription errors while writing, the transcription couldn't keep up, the margins changed randomly and the text lines would shift.\n\nI looked for meaningful documentation that would clearly explain the functionality of the S Note application and I couldn't find any. There are a lot of buttons and options, but no clear documentation. The videos that Samsung provides are interesting, but very peripheral and don't really help someone who has bought the tablet and needs to do something with it. The videos appear to be mostly pre-sales marketing tools.\n\nA random annoyance is that the Google Now widget displays \"cards\", but upon clicking the widget, the device apologies that Google Search has \"stopped\".\n\nI already own an iPad 3 and was hoping this device would meet my requirements for a small device I could pull out for writing notes as needed. However I'm a disappointed with the Note 8 at this point.\n\nUpdate #1 (March 16, 2014, updating rating  to 2 stars): It appears the Google Now problem is related to a recent update.  A commenter on Google Search in the \"Play Store\" claimed having the same problem with Google Now on a Note 8. I had cleared the Google Search cache and data to no avail.  When I backed out of the Google Search update, Google Now appeared to behave correctly.\n\nHaving dug around a bit more with the \"S Note\" application, I understand it better. Yet, challenges persist:\n1) There is a noticeable period (perhaps an average of 2 seconds) where the tablet is working on the text recognition and the tablet is not accepting input from the S Pen.  This results in a period where one is writing freehand text, but the tablet is not recording the writing.  This makes writing more than a few words at a time frustrating.  Understanding how the text recognition algorithm works and allowing for adjustment would be helpful here.  For example, it would be useful if I could set a timer which waited for perhaps 5 seconds after the last S Pen \"stroke\" before attempting text recognition.\n2) Looking at example \"templates\", the maximum number of words in the template appear to be a sentence or less. This would suggest that the software developers either didn't design the application to handle more than a sentence at a time, or there are hardware limitations which makes attempting to write more than a sentence at a time difficult.\n3) A hope is that there exist other applications which work with the Note 8 that have a better text recognition workflow. As I learned when I wrote freehand text on my iPad, it's nifty that I can write this text, but it's not so nifty that my options for doing something with the writing (such as text recognition) afterwards are limiting.\n\nA different random annoyance is that when opening up Google News with the \"Internet\" or \"Chrome\" browsers, the screen appears to initially render completely, but all of the news and headline text disappears.\n\nIn my experience, the automatic brightness adjustment causes the screen to be too dark or dim in many cases."}

I bought my boyfriend the galaxy tab and thought it was great, so I really went back and forth trying to decide if the note was worth the extra cost.. let me just say it IS. The seemingly minor adjustments to the features actually make a huge difference, and the note taking capabilities literally are a life saver. I sync up my phone and touchpad calendars to keep me in order, eliminated the cost of buying notebooks for school, saved myself the hassle of lugging around my laptop for movies, and use the dual-screen capabilities on a daily basis. It's such a simple layout and the battery lasts forever. The resolution is really nice as well and I often times will use my touchpad for playing music in the morning while getting ready as well. I love being able to put it in my purse, and at the same time have it be big enough to watch movies and tv on.\n\nCon: restricted to only certain apps for dual screen.. but still many more than on the galaxy s4!\nNot sure if it does screen mirroring or s beam... that would be nice.\n\nJust all around a wonderful decision.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "This is Excellent for the price.  I've owned one for close to a year, and its the perfect balance between a 5\" and 10\".  Most people won't be happy with the resolution of the screen, but I think its just fine especially for taking notes.  Speed is fine for browsing and writing, although at times it can have trouble with intense games.\n\n I've owned the new Note 10.1 2014 version, and the Note 2, and I actually enjoy the Note 8.0 much better (to each their own) than either of them.  Yes the 10.1 2014 version has a nicer screen and higher specs, but if you're using this tablet for Note taking or drawing, higher everything also meant draining the battery quickly.  I just shut off the Wi-fi, turn down the screen to 35-50%, and I'm set for hours in school. Also, although the new S-note has nice new shiny excellent features, there is obvious lag in the pen, and you can't use detailed erasing when drawing like the note 8.0.  In erase mode, once you touch the current piece you have written, the eraser will remove EVERYTHING.  There are no settings to remove this.  The Note 8.0 uses very detailed erasing, and writing is very smooth.\n\nFor those that are wondering if the Note 8.0 is good for taking notes at school, I'd say yes.  I've used it through 3 hour classes no problem,  and its easy to write and erase things during class.  Once I hit 60-70%, I attach a portable battery to it and juice it back to 100%.  Place the tablet in landscape, and its easy to write.  Pinch to zoom for detailed writing and you can pan around the screen using the same two fingers while dragging them along to the spots you'd like to view (at times it feels like an old type writer when pulling the page back to the beginning of the next line).  Its great for kids to practice their ABC's, just be sure to properly protect it and keep an eye on the S-pen.\n\nS-note is decent, but I prefer using the app Lecture Notes.  It costs $5, but well worth the cost if you like to customize your note taking and download PDF's to write over.  I sometimes download Coloring Book PDF's for my niece to draw on and save myself from buying books and crayons.  Its also great when a professor emails PDF's for class because you can highlight important information.  I'd sometimes \"white out\" terms, study the content, then remove the \"white out\" portions to check if I was correct on the term.  Its and excellent tool.\n\nIn the end, its all about personal preference.  I like the balance of an 8\" tablet, vs bigger or smaller versions.  I think I spent too much money at the time I purchased this gadget, but if the tablet is in the $200 range, I'd say its worth every penny.  Spend time with it, and you'll be very happy with this device."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "Pros: Small form factor, long battery life, good suite of pre-installed programs, SD-card up-gradable, stylus works perfectly, lightweight, recent OS can run any Android apps (as of this writing), IR blaster for remote control capability, great stylus shortcuts, easy screen captures, practically anything can be \"shared\" to other apps (like Gmail, Evernote, Dropbox, etc.), bright and clear screen, very customizable interface, charges pretty quickly, makes a good e-Reader, usable for personal and professional tasks.\n\nCons: Templates in S-Note are very difficult to create and customize; takes some tech know-how.  It's slow to notify you of things you already knew (tells you that you plugged in headphones several minutes after the fact while watching a movie, for example). Battery is not really replaceable by the user without taking it apart. The Kit Kat Android OS hasn't been pushed out to it yet (as best I can tell).\n\nRecommending tablets is a funny business; we all use them for different things. I am comfortable with Mac, Windows, Android, and iOS, so I can adapt. If you're an iPad-only person, this will take some time to get used to. If you're a Microsoft person, same thing. I think it's very intuitive though, and love all the shortcuts for opening apps, taking screenshots and partial screen captures, taking/editing photos on the fly, etc.  If it weren't for just a couple apps that are iPad-only, I'd switch to this device exclusively.\n\nI do a good amount of handwriting on my tablet, so the size is becoming a limitation for me personally. Will probably upgrade to the new 12\" Note Pro that was just released so I have more space to write naturally. But if you're looking for a good tablet in the 7-8\" range, this one is highly recommended. I can't think of much I would suggest to the manufacturer for new features, other than a few bug fixes here or there.\n\nBTW, I bought mine refurbished and haven't had a single issue with it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I've been using this tablet for 6 months now mostly for taking notes in classes and meetings with an average use of a few hours a day.\nThe accessories: a folio case with a stylus loop holder, anti glare screen protector, and a Wacom note stylus.  I have not rooted this or used any customized ROMs.\n\nShort review: After 6 mo, I still use this everyday for quite a few hours.  Great for note taking and pdf reading on the go.  However, those who intend to use this for hours of note taking and studying off of this should consider the 10.1 inch version, more screen real estate matters in this case.  The lack of quality accessory vendor partnership makes it harder to turn this into a full productivity work horse.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nThe great things:\n- Compact and portable, much easier than carrying a 10.1 in tablet around\n- The stylus (the original and the Wacom one that I bought) work really well on the tablet.\n- Palm rejection is great on this. Though sometimes your hand might hit the \"back\" button on the lower right next to the home button.\n- I get about 6-7 hours of usage out of this\n\nThe not so great things:\n- The screen resolution is not the sharpest out there, if you watch a lot of movies or need to have the best resolution, then this might not be for you. For casual users who focus mainly on taking notes and reading, I found this to be more than adequate.\n- Requires to have a high output charger.  The included charger is a 2.1A one, and this won't charge when you plug it into a computer.\n- Almost no big time accessory vendor partnership.  This is still a niche product, all the accessories like keyboards and such are from less known vendors. While these still work great, they add unnecessary bulk.  Zagg makes a folio keyboard for this tablet that is really good but makes it hard to use the tablet for writing and is way over priced.\n- The included stylus is great but a bit too small to write comfortably for an extended period of time (>20 min).  I bought a Wacom stylus and found it to be much better, and it also has an eraser on the back so you can just use it like an eraser on the tablet.\n\nThoughts on taking notes:\nI got this tablet to reduce the paper clutter and also to be able to remember and organize all the little notes that I take.  This tablet does all that and then some. The only adjustment that I made was make sure not to press down too hard while writing.  When writing on paper, we tend to press the ballpoint down a bit to get the ink out, but on the tablet screen this isn't required.  Once you are adjusted to that, I find myself writing faster on the tablet than on paper.\n\nThe big app on the tablet is the S Note.  My favorite feature is this \"Recording\" option in the app.  When you press the button, the app will record whatever your pen strokes are next.  This is fantastic for taking notes on equations or diagrams (ie those orgo reactions or physics equations) because when you hit replay, it will play back what you've written, stroke by stroke!  The downside about the app is that you can't read it easily out of the tablet. You have to manually export it as a pdf or png (image) file as the actual note file is proprietary and there aren't apps out there that can read it on a pc or mac easily.  Once you've exported, you also can't edit it.  What i find myself using more is the LectureNotes app, which is really good.  Same idea as the S Note, but you can export it more easily into Evernote.\n\nIf you are in college or taking classes and intend on using your tablet more like a productivity machine throughout your daily schedule, I would actually recommend the 10.1 inch version.  I think the 8.0 is great for meeting notes and writing on the go, but when you are dealing with hours of lectures and really have to study off of a tablet, the larger dimensions do make sense.  It is also easier to do multi window on a larger screen.  After 6 months of using this, I still find it to be fast and responsive.  The screen does heat up a bit if you are charging and using it at the same time.  I also suggest on getting a Wacom stylus, like the one here (http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S-Pen-Stylus-Eraser/dp/B009QW3SGQ/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1393774422&sr=8-6&keywords=wacom+galaxy+note+stylus).  The bigger size actually makes it a lot easier to write with.\n\nMy only gripe is that there aren't many quality, thin-profiled keyboard cases for this that are reasonably priced.  Because of the lack of quality accessory vendor support, I'm taking a star away in the rating.  For high profile products like this, I take into account of how the accessory support is when considering the final rating."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "*** 9/19/14 ***This is an update after 6 and 1/2 months. This review was originally a 5 star review. I am knocking 3 stars off because about a month ago (when the pad was less than 6 months old), I discovered that a spot had formed on the edge of the pad. It was about an inch long and about 1/4 of an inch wide, and it appeared as though the screen was separating from the glass. I called Samsung and sure, it's under warranty, BUT you have to send it to their ONE service center in the entire US of A, and it will take 1-2 weeks to have it back. So wrong. Right?\n\nYou do not sell someone a piece of equipment that encourages them to use it to for every aspect of their life, and then tell them that when it turns out to be defective (or maybe it's junk to begin with?) that it will take 1 -2 weeks to rectify the problem. Of course, you have to save all of your data and they're not responsible for what's lost, you are responsible for insuring the device, print the label, ship it... wrong.\n\nI decided that even though I am a bit OCD and can't take bubbles or imperfections, I had to live with it as this pad has too much on it to A) be without it for 2 weeks and B) too much that can be potentially lost forever once they mess with it. Well, I lost that choice 2 days ago when it just stopped working. I could not open the screen, nor turn it off. The screen had since \"grown\" two more of those bubbly patches as well. I am guessing that this problem walks hand in hand with the screen and pad not working.\n\nI spoke to the customer service escalations dept with the first problem, and once again when it went kaput. The most that they would do is say that they would \"mark it as rushed.\" Mmmm, bet that'll get it back here in a few days!\n\nIt is either a defective pad, or the product is just junk to begin with. Either way, Samsung should at the very least, have enough service centers that a person can have their defective product back in 3 days maximum. However, what they should do in a situation like this is, replace the thing overnight. When you claim that a product is all that and a bag of chips, then this should be automatic.\n\nSo I love the pad, as the review below explains, yet if it ends up in repair for one month out of every year, well, I will hate it. Whatever the case, I can definitively say with gusto, I hate Samsung customer service policy. I will update again.\n\n First Review:\nThis is technically the first Note Pad I've owned,  however,  my son won an ipad (the New ipad) a couple of years ago, so I do have experience with that. I definitely did not want an ipad. To me, it's just a glorified smart phone and toy that's not very smart and not much fun to play with. Apple limits the amount of real work and enjoyment one can get out of it.\n\nWhen selecting a note pad, I looked for something that I could be productive with ( particularly with documents and such) whilst having the \"oomph\" that it takes for some reading and perhaps a movie every now and then. Not everyone who is in business,  thinks business all of the time. Not everyone who enjoys leisurely entertainment,  wants to be entertained all of the time, either.\n\nThe spen is something I don't think that I'll ever want to give up. I don't know why every pad doesn't have one. I LOVE the spen!\n\nThis little thing allows me to enjoy movies and reading without a hitch, I can create and edit documents of all types and keep myself more organized than I've ever been.  The quality,  in my opinion,  is great. I like the plastic backing and it has a perfect weight where it doesn't feel cheap or too heavy.\n\nAll in all, I don't have a bad thing to say, after owning this for a month now. Don't know how I'll feel in a few months, or next year, but right now, this is glued to me and that's where I'm happy to have it!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I almost bought the 2013 Nexus 7 but decided on this one instead and I am so glad I did.  The s-pen makes this tablet what it is.  The Wacom style digitizer makes sketching and note taking a breeze.  I draw almost daily now where I used to go through spurts of occasional drawing because I would seldom take my sketchbook with me.  Now the sketchbook is always close at hand.\n\nFor my church, I'm responsible for the leadership meeting minutes/notes and I found that writing on the note 8 is natural and less intrusive than something with a physical keyboard.  The handwriting recognition is pretty good for normal words but gets confused easily when writing out less common names/places or words unique to our faith.  Because of this, I've abandoned the handwriting to text to just handwriting in the excellent S-Note and Lecture Note apps for simplicity.  Less correcting of the incorrect auto-correct that way.  For short notes or writing in other apps the handwriting recognition is good enough.\n\nOther aspects of the tablet are fine. The IR port works but is kind of irrelevant to me as I seldom watch TV with it.  Screen resolution is plenty sharp for my near-sighted eyes.  The processor is quick and snappy and I've barely used up much of the 16gb (more like 8 or 9 after all the preloaded Samsung stuff).  I have an SD card to expand the memory but haven't needed much of that space either except for my growing collection of sketches.  The expandability is nice if I ever do run out of space.\n\nOverall I love the tablet as it allows me to create content easily and not merely consume it.  That capability from the s-pen and active digitizer make all the difference to me.  Worth the price."}

On the other hand, if you plan on writing digitally, it's perfect. I use it for all my notes and homework at university. I've never had any complaints about performance or battery life. (In fact, I rarely get it below 50% in a day). The stylus is very accurate. The size seems perfect for a tablet. Much bigger, and I might as well use my laptop, but any smaller and it would be hard to use. It even fits in my coat pocket! All the Samsung junk is a bit annoying, but you can disable most of the things through the Application Manager in settings.\n\nSome tips if you want to use it for taking notes:\n  - I find the app LectureNotes the most capable Android application for note-taking. The full version is $5 I think, but when you just bought a $300 tablet, what's another 5? It easily lets you import PDFs to write on, and you can export as PDF to print to share. By using another application called DropSync, it will sync all your notes to Dropbox (which you get an extra 50GB from buynig this tablet), viewable on your computer.\n  - I bought a separate stylus to make long writing sessions more comfortable. It's the \"Bamboo Stylus Feel for Samsung Galaxy Note\". Be sure you get the one with the product code CS300UK2, not CS300UK, because it will not write accurately. It's only available from Wacom's website."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "So far so good with this tablet.  Performance is flawless and I have experiences no glitches of any kind.  I got the Samsung note mostly because of the note/stylus feature and also because, unlike almost every other tablet out there, it has an SD slot so you can add up to 64 GB more storage.  By comparison, the iPad mini with 64 GB of built-in storage will run you about $500 and if the note feature of the Samsung is important to you then you will be missing out on that too.  So when you compare this tablet with others, make sure you are comparing machines with the same features or the comparison will not mean much.\n\nMy only regret is that I didn't just go ahead and get the 10.1 (2014 edition) version since the 8.0 can be a bit small at times.  The trade off is the fact that the 8.0 is a bit more portable and of course lighter but I think I would have rather have traded the slight loss of portability for the extra screen size.  If you are considering an 8\" tablet, give this some thought.  Its not like you can put the 8.0 in your pocket anyway so you don't lose a whole lot by stepping up to the larger size (other than the increased price, of course.)  But all in all, I'm happy with it and I plan to keep it until such time as I am ready for a new one.  At that time, I will almost certainly go with a larger size of whatever model is current at that time."}

This is by far the most comprehensive tablet I have owned to date. You will find better entertainment specs on different tablets like the iPad, but if you want something that can be used for EVERYTHING, the Note 8 is the way to go. I mean, the resolution is just fine for enjoying movies and games (people often complain because this doesn't stack up to something like the Nexus or Retina display). I love this thing. I love the S Pen. I love the handwriting to text features. I love the size. I love being able to shove this into my jacket pocket and rock out to my favorite tunes using wireless bluetooth earbuds.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I have been purchasing Sam Tabs since the Galaxy Tab 2 7.  Since then I have had the Tab 2 10.1 and the famous and wish they would have kept improving Tab 7.7 which I still have. I also have the Note 2 and a first gen iPad. I wouldn't have even purchased the Note 8 if I had not cracked my screen on the 7.7.  Glad I did purchase it though.  It's faster and showed the age of my 7.7 with how it handles the whole experience of using a tablet.\n  I won't go thru all the tech stuff that many have submitted.  But I can address the issue of the upgrade to Jellybean 4.2.2.  Samsung must have corrected the problem that many have described where the multi-window functionality stopped working after installing it.  Mine not only worked fine but to my surprise and pleasure, the unit installed all my apps that I had on my 7.7 and afterwards installed the upgrade with no loss of data.  It even restored all my photos that i had on my other units;\nI purchased the Moko slim case with a magnet.  It may be a little early to tell if it's the magnet or not but every now and then when I fold the flap in back of the tablet hand touches are nonresponsive.  Oddly enough though, the pen still worked.  If I turn it off and back on again the hand touches worked again.  I will use it without the case for a day or 2 to see if that is the problem.  I heard this unit has had problems with magnetized covers.  Otherwise, the experience I have with this tablet is very similar to what I have with the Note 2.  Excellent.  My only gripe is that it didn't come with a better display.  The colors are beautiful and reading text are sharp but the movie experience is no where near as crisp as the Note 2 or even as crisp as my Galaxy 7.7.\n  Another complaint that i have read is the size of the bezel.  What a silly quibble.  My 7.7 has the exact same size bezel and it was haled as one of the best tablets of its time.  The thing cost $700 without contract when it came out and now we pay 3-400 for a tab that is more powerful and feature rich and complain it cost too much.  i tried using the other tablets with a thinner bezel and my hand kept touching the darn screen activating various apps I didn't want loaded.\nPlastic is another issue.  Almost all tablets are made of either plastic or aluminum or a combination of the 2.  Look and feel are subjective preferences but to use a tablet without having a protective cover is not very wise imho. Once you place a cover on it, look and feel go out the window anyway.\nOne more quibble.  Battery life.  Not the greatest.  The note 2 lasts all day with heavy use.  I have never been able to max it out even watching movies, surfing, gaming, using the phone etc.  The Note 8 not so much.  You have to put it on power saving mode to get the best life out of it.  I have only had it for 2 days and I already had to charge it once and right now it's at 74%.  Shame on you Samsung.  My Galaxy 7.7 gets better battery life.  But then again it has a super amoled plus display that uses less power with more punch in color and vibrance.  Better blacks too.\nEven with these caveats, the Note 8 is a great tablet to use and since it is a tablet and not a phone you get true \"desktop\" web browsing, more screen realestate and Samsung Note apps and usability to boot.  Not bad for $289.  If you want the magazine UI you can download Chameleon Launcher and get the best of both worlds.  Just thought I'd through that in for free.  The launcher needs a little work but it does change the way you see and utilize your tablet.  Better categorizing of home screens etc.\n\nWould I recommend the Note 8.0?  Now that you can get at a price point that competes with iPad mini, Nexus 7 and LG G8.3... Yeahhh!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I had it narrowed down to this tablet, the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014), and possibly an iPad (comparable in price to the Note 10.1).\n\nI saw this one for $230, factory refurbished. The price was irresistible.\n\nI couldn't be happier. I was concerned that the screen was a little to small. I use this mainly for watching videos (often on plane rides) and grading papers (college-level Math homework).\n\nI got a (free) Android app for annotating PDF's that I use to grade papers electronically. Having the stylus is indispensable for this purpose, especially because it's very difficult to type Mathematical symbols into any word processor. One can use typesetting software, but this is very impractical when you just want to grade papers.\n\nStreaming video over wifi (ESPN3, HBOGO, Netflix) works very well. For plane rides, the Android video player works very well. I have to convert some video files to mp4, but there is viable software on the internet (cost-free) to do this. The battery has been more than sufficient for flying coast-to-coast (unlike my old laptop's battery).\n\nI highly recommend the Galaxy Note 8.0. I was a little concerned that the screen would be too small, but I find it to be perfect for my purposes. I like Apple products very much, but I don't think I would be as satisfied with an iPad for its lack of stylus and inflexibility with video playback. (And no, I'm not converting back to Windows or Linux, I still love my MacBook and I'll get another when it dies (6 years and going).)"}

After long and extensive research, I thought this tablet would be the perfect tablet for my school needs. I already own and iPhone 5s, so buying another iPad just seemed like having a giant version of my phone. After playing with my new tablet I can only think of two real issues with the tablet.\n\nPros:\n-Perfect purse size tablet\n-Small and light\n-S-pen is an amazing feature\n-Quick response time\n-great screen resolution\n-samsung sends emails about different features supported by the note 8\n\nCons:\n-it is 16gb before all the preinstalled apps provided by samsung. After realizing that the approximately free 9gb would not be enough space for me, I invested in a 32gb sd card. If considering this tablet, the sd card is a much needed accessory.\n-certain cases distort s-pen functionality. The resolution to this problem is to look for cases that do not have a magnet in the design.\n\nHonestly, I'm happy I recieved this tablet and I would recommend this tablet to others. However, do your own research before buying an expensive product like this. The Note 10.1 2014 edition was just released before I bought this one, but I liked the size of this one over the Note 10.1."}

Worked with all my office documents (iPad:  5  -  Galaxy Note (with One Note & Kingsoft Office): 8)\n3.  Was easy to access and use when crunched for time in an airport (iPad & Galaxy Note: 10)\n\nI am VERY pleased with the Galaxy Note 8.  The features I like best are:\n1.  Android OS - more free apps and overall cost of apps is less; more flexibility in customizing; similar OS as my Moto Razr Maxx\n2.  Very fast processor\n3.  great memory.  I have a large number of apps and it NEVER gets bogged down due to too many things running\n4.  I've added a keyboard and case that helps with productivity\n5.

I don't use the S Pen as much as I thought I would, but is very nice to have when I choose to use it.\n\nThe size of the Galaxy Note 8 is the most difficult thing for me to get used to.  Not the screen size, per se, but the size and feel of the Note itself.  It is just too big for me to comfortably hold in one hand, but still smaller than the full size iPad i used before.  By this I am not complaining about the screen size, I think the screen size is very good. Rather, it is just a bit awkward feeling but I am getting more used to it."}

The stylus is very useful; takes a bit of practice.  Apps noted as optimized for phone work very well on this tablet (just bigger).\n\nEasy to set up out of the box, be ready to log in your Samsung and Google accounts.  Will then import in all your Google and Samsung apps and info.\n\nOne quirk to be prepared to handle - some users, including me, have a problem when the tablet automatically upgrades from android 4.1.2 (out of box) to 4.2.2.  This happens right away.  I soon noticed that the multi screen feature and the quick screen did not work.  Could not fix.  Went to blogs and learned that this is a known problem (thanks Samsung).  The solution is not as scary as it sounds.  Go to settings,backup and select factory reset.  Reinstalls 4.1.2.  Will automatically update to 4.2.2 again, but this time without the error noted above.  Joy, except you now have to set up the tablet all over again.  Any apps and preferences you earlier set have to be redone.  Cost me a half hour or so.\n\nOnce past that unpleasantness, great experience and great tablet.  Definitely get the Google keyboard as it is superior to the Samsung keyboard; Swype is so fast.\n\nThe processor is fast! The integration is excellent.  Widgets are excellent.  The Google apps work well together (definitely look into most all of them).  Screen is sharp and as bright as you desire it to be.  Tablet form factor excellent and easy with one hand (OK, I am a male and have a good sized hand).  Battery life good; I charged when I opened it Tue afternoon and all night Tue and still have 27% battery late Thursday night (full disclosure - I only use a bit at breakfast and after work).\n\nI would but this tablet again and really like it.

For example:\n(1) Auto-rotation can not be turned off on camera. Most of the time I have to look at the picture which is upside - down.\n(2) Finger- operate can not be turned off. This cause your hands touch un-wanted  buttons all the time. Operate this device is like walking in a land mine field.\n  The only good thing about this gadget is the S pen."}

It's excellent for reading, playing games, reading email and watching Netflix.  Then I wanted a tablet that I could take handwritten notes on, and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 is perfect.  I've only had it a month, so I'm still learning, but I use it for all the things I used the Kindle for, plus so much more.  The app selection is so much larger through Google Play, and the 8-inch size is perfect for me.  I did look at the Ipad Mini before making my choice, and I'm glad I got this one instead....highly recommended!!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "If theres only one thing I could say about this tablet, Id say its the perfect device for me! What I personally love the most about the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 is the integrated S Pen, which comes with features, such as note-taking and handwriting-to-text, unique to this tablet that make it perfect for students. The fact that theres many ways to personalize the home screens also attracted me to this tablet. I love the retro-looking appearance of this tablet, and its 8 inches makes it portable, perfect to fit in the palm of my hand! (The additional inch compared to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7-inch really makes a difference. It's perfect if your not looking for the size and cost of a larger tablet like the Samsung Galaxy Note Tablet 10.1) The Samsung Galaxy Note Tablet is an efficient productivity tablet. Along with the S pen, It comes with a variety of other useful features, like the multi-window function that allows two apps to be open at once side-by-side (which is awesome to me);an infrared blaster, which can have the device as a remote control to any tv; and the eye sensor, which keeps the screen on as long as you're looking at it. I praise this devices great battery life, fast web browser speed, high video and speaker quality, 16GB storage, and decent front and rear camera. The Samsung Galaxy Note Tablet comes in an affordable $300 to $400 price range, yet I feel it is slightly overpriced for a mini tablet, but this tablet is worth it, especially with the inclusion of the S Pen and $400 worth of Galaxy Perks that come with purchase of this Galaxy device! The Samsung Galaxy Note is the perfect balance of work/school and fun. I highly recommend this tablet to anyone the S Pen stands out to and the avid note-taker, reader, and drawer. If the S Pen isn't for you I'd consider the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0, ipad mini, or the Google Nexus 7 if your looking for a similar product.\nI had it for 10 days already and I absolutely love my awesome new tablet! It is everything I hoped for!"}

No complaints there. HOWEVER, I am FURIOUS over on thing that I cant fathom how Samsung is getting away withMy 16 gig device only reads that it has 9.87 gigs! Not available, but total. The box says 16 gigs, the device says 9.87 of total space  I currently only have 5 gigs remaining. I spoke with two Samsung techs at Best Buy. One never got back with an answer. The second called me back and explained that the problem was the preloaded software  or bloatware. 7 gigs of crap preloaded on the device!!! And, you guessed it, these apps can NOT be deleted. How they can sell a device labeled 16 gigs and only list 9 gigs under total storage??....seems like fraud, false advertising.pick a dirty trick and insert your own. Very disappointed. They MUST release an update that allows me to remove useless garbage from my device. Is Samsung becoming like Apple and deciding what is best for me? I hope not.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I took the plunge on a refurbished Note 8 and couldn't be happier. I have owned many pen devices over the years, from the original Compaq iPaq, IBM Wacom based Thinkpads, and the original Galaxy Note phone. I'm going to start this review by saying don't buy this tablet if you don't want a pen based device... there are cheaper options that will fill the tablet role without the added cost of the Wacom pen. If you are still reading, I'll assume you want a device with a real pen.\n\nThe Note 8 is the perfect size for a note taking device. The Galaxy Note I phone I own and love just wasn't big enough to make the pen really useful for me. The design of the tablet is simple, with gently curved corners and a fairly wide bezel. The lack of an easily removable back provides decent rigidity that makes it feel less creaky than my phone. The back can be removed for a fairly easy battery replacement... but it is not meant to be swapped in and out like a phone battery.  I wish Samsung didn't put the big chrome logo on top, but it is what it is.\n\nThe pen is slightly longer and fatter than the pen that comes with the Note phones. It is mostly round, with a flat side where the button is. The tip of the pen has a nice texture which adds some drag when used on the glass. The nib is not replaceable with standard Wacom nibs. I personally use a Wacom pen that I purchased for my laptop. It has the eraser on one end and replaceable nibs. It is the size of a standard pen, and obviously won't fit in the tablets pen holder. I find it much nicer to write with than the provided pen.\n\nFrom an inking perspective, the pen is accurate for me. I'm left handed and I don't have any issues with the alignment of the nib and on-screen cursor position. There is some minor lag if you are drawing fast where you may notice the ink takes a fraction of a second to catch up. It's not horrible, but may be noticeable and annoying if you are expecting the device to be just like ink and paper. In truth, it's pretty fast compared to other Wacom devices I've used. I *always* put a screen protector on my pen devices... while the glass is durable, all it takes is a small grain to get caught on your tip or eraser to make a scratch. I am using the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/iSmooth-Samsung-Galaxy-Note-8-Ultra-Clear-Premium-HD-Screen-Protector-2-Pack/dp/B00DE14KU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">iSmooth Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Ultra Clear Premium HD Screen Protector 2 Pack</a>&nbsp;which is working out well.\n\nIf you are looking for a case, check out the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MoKo-Slim-Cover-Case-for-Samsung-Galaxy-Note-8-0-inch-GT-N5100-Android-Tablet-Black-with-lip-Stand-Integrated-Elastic-Hand-Strap-and-Stylus-Loop-Lifetime-Warranty/dp/B00B4BEAM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MoKo Slim Cover Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 inch GT - N5100 Android Tablet, Black (with lip Stand, Integrated Elastic Hand Strap, and Stylus Loop)-Lifetime Warranty</a>. It fits well and the brown leather looks nice in contrast to the white tablet. There is some talk about the magnets in many of the cases interfering with the s-pen, possibly even causing permanent problems, so I took an exacto knife and carefully removed them from the case.\n\nOn the application side, S-Note is where the Note 8 makes the S-Pen shine. It does everything you would expect a note taking app to do, including the ability to export notes to a pdf for sharing with non S-Note users. The only thing missing for me feature in Microsoft One Note where it translates your ink in the background and makes your handwritten notes searchable.\n\nFrom a general perspective of tablet use, the Note 8 works fine. The lcd is sharp and has great viewing angles. Video playback is smooth and the device feels very snappy in general. I appreciate that Samsung still provides a micro sd slot... it is becoming too rare these days. As is normal for Samsung, they add in their usual bloatware apps that can't be removed. While you can root the Galaxy Note 8, if you install an Android rom like Cyanogenmod you will loose the ability to run S-Note and many of the other tightly integrated s-pen features. Samsung tends to be stingy with their OS updates, and I'll be surprised if they support the device after 4.4 Kitkat. The battery is good, but not stellar. Be careful with apps that provide background notifications/updates as they will chew away at your battery when the tablet is idle.\n\nIn summary, the Note 8 is almost perfect for me. If Microsoft released a fully functional version of One Note for Android I would be in heaven, but it will never happen. The Surface Pro is just too big and expensive for what I need. At the current price, the refurbished Note 8 is about the same price as a good new 7\" tablet without a pen, which seems like a great deal to me."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "Small enough that I can hold in one hand and write with other with S-pen or pop-up keyboard. Large enough to split screen between multiple spots. Love that I can write a document in one app window and look up facts/references/calendar in other window.

I'm not a game player but I've been very pleased watching videos.\n\nNext project: to use with my home computer network and A/V streaming to TV via CromeCast or DLNA. One disappointment: the IR blaster and Peel remote. For me I have to be close (~6') for reliable control; and Peel setups don't handle my standard Panasonic smart Blu-ray player, and set-top box interface is clunky.

In fact, I now find it to be heavy and clunky when compared to the Note.\n\nI have found this to be the perfect size as I can hold it in one hand, or not feel like I'm cradiling a TV tray in both hands.  It's perfect for games and the resolution is amazing.\n\nBattery life is much better than my Galaxy S3, considering that the Note 8 is a quad-processor.\n\nVery solid device and does not feel cheap, despite the plastic back.\n\nThe S-Pen is very nice and responsive.  I like how the device turns on and unlocks when the pen is removed.  Pen location is located in the bottom right corner.  One would expect it to be at the top of the device, but being able to pull down instead of pull up seems to be more ideal.  When pen is docked, it blends seemlessly with the rounded corner.  Easily detaches by running your fingernail down.\n\nFor the price, you would definately want to check into the Note 8 if you are looking at a Nook or Fire, as those reader apps are available on the Note."}

With the Note 8 and these Apps, I haven't used my Desktop since.\n\nNEED TO HAVE Apps for the Samsung Galaxy Note 8\n\nmazec3**\n\nThis App replaces your keyboard and enables you to hand write in every App, email and on the internet using the S/Pen.  Most people have difficulty reading my hand writing and yet this App is able to consistently convert it into text. I find that hand writing with mazec3 on the Note 8 is noticeably faster than tapping or swipping on a keyboard.  With this App and the Note 8, you'll get more done than you could on any other tablet.\n\n**It is worth noting that the Samsung keyboard does have a native handwriting recognition mode built in (you can find it in the keyboard's settings).  However, instead of writing continuously, you can only input a couple words at a time.  It's reliable - but it will slow you down.\n\nPolaris Office\n\nThis App comes pre loaded on the Note 8 but I am highlighting it to urge you to use it...because it is so amazing.  I have tried several Apps to create and edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents-nothing comes close to Polaris Office.  It is extremely easy to use and the editing tools closely mirror the Office Desktop Software.  So far, I haven't found anything that I used to do on my desktop that I haven't been able to do with Polaris Office.  In fact, when combined with mazec3, I prefer Polaris Office to the desktop.\n\nG Cloud\n\nThis App backs up all of your files including documents, music, contacts etc... Just install it on all your devices - including your old tablet, then back-up all your files and you can easily download any of the files on the Note 8. I also use Drop Box, but the reason I love this App is because I can easily get my music from my past and present devices onto my Note 8 and my documents are backed up daily so I can't lose anything.\n\nmSecure\n\nThis App stores all your passwords and log in information.  What makes this App stand out from the pack (and will save you time) is that from mSecure in a click or two you can instantly login to your favorite Websites-without having to open your browser, type in the URL, and type in your login info... mSecure does all the work for you.  I also used to use the same 2-3 passwords over and over.  With mSecure, I now have unique passwords for all my logins using their password generator.  I no longer use my desktop to login to online banking or web applications... it's faster and easier on the Note 8.\n\nI hope this gives you a better idea of what is possible with the Note 8.  You are going to love it!\n\nOther Apps to Consider if the Note 8 is your First Tablet:\n-Google Voice Search\n-Drop Box\n-Dolphin Browser\n-EverNote\n-CalenGoo\n-Glympse"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me. I design apps for a living and I bought the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Tablet as a test device because so much of my negative feedback stems from this model. After unboxing the device, I initially had no idea what users were complaining about. The hardware is solid and beautiful and everything works as promised.\n\nOf course, this honeymoon period was short lived and now I cringe everytime I pick up this device. There are things that work fine on other Android Tablets that just simply defy explanations on the Samsung Galaxy 8.\n\nBLOATWARE:\nI should have known better but, true to form I too started to experience the same issues with Samsung that my users were experiencing. First, the sheer volume of Samsung \"bloatware\" that ships with the tablet is amazing. These are Samsung branded apps that take up storage space on your device that you might never use. Granted SOME of the apps are useful but most just take up space. It is as if Samsung doesn't realize there's a whole Google Play store that users can access anytime they need a new app. Yes, there is a micro SD port that allows me to expand my storage capacity but, it'd be nice if Samsung just allowed users to delete all of it's bloatware if the user doesnt use them. Period. (Note that this type of behavior is not isolated to Samsung. Many device manufacturers -- from HTC to the Carriers do the same thing.)\n\nFIRMWARE and SOFTWARE (OPERATING SYSTEM) UPDATES:\nUnlike Google Nexus Devices, the Galaxy Note 8.0 is a slave to the device manufacturer. What this means is, if Google releases a new update to their Android software  you can't just download it and experience the benefits right away. You have to wait until Samsung releases their own version of the update before you have access to it on your Samsung device. Most of the time, its because they have to test their own \"bloatware\" to see if it works on the new update. If it doesn't they need to retool their apps BEFORE they release the updates. If you don't use Samsung's bloatware apps, this can be more than frustrating.\n(Sure you can 'root' the device and override this issue  but, if you bought this to experience how most people would use the device, then rooting it defeats the whole purpose of using it as a test device.)\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE is ABOMIDABLE:\nYou may, overtime (for me it was within 90 days) start experiencing problems where your tablet starts to crash incessantly (you'll see the dreaded \"Unfortunately Cloud Agent Has Stopped\" message.) When you get online with Customer Service they will run you through a script (this is true for most Customer Service centers) as they try to diagnose just what is wrong with your device as well as what they can do to fix your problem(s).\n\nHowever, if you're an experienced Android user, you've most likely already gone online and done your due diligence and searched through user forums and found a bevy of unhappy Samsung Galaxy Note 8 owners with the same complaints/issues that you're experiencing. Most likely that means you've already updated your software, already power cycled (turn it off and then on again), completed a factory reset and a myriad of other quick fixes on your customer service representative's script.\n\nHaving done all of the above, THIS is when your customer service rep starts grasping at straws to explain why your device may be misbehaving (phantom touches, screen lock-ups, crashes). And the solutions flung out at you range from blaming the magnets in your device case (which by the way is a SAMSUNG branded case specifically for the Galaxy Note 8) to blaming the micro-SD card (Im using a SanDisk Ultra) to telling you to delete all your apps and start from scratch (not a desirable process).\n\nMAYBE ITs A FLUKE\nHaving exhausted most of my patience, I decided (foolishly) that maybe my device was a lemon. One built on the last shift of the last day of the work week. These things happen. SO I bought a second Samsung Galaxy Note 8  this time from an actual bricks and mortar retailer (BestBuy)  and just like my previous experience, it was great out of the box but, performance would start to lag in just a matter of days. It didn't matter that I killed all uneccessary tasks, was running only one app at a time, had RAM to spare, 10+ GB of open storage (more if you factor in the SD card), or even limited the specific apps I downloaded  the NEW Samsung Tablet acted much like it's twin I purchased online.\n\nKeep in mind Im not running anything out of the ordinary on these tablets, Im just using my Bank's Bill Pay app, Readability, Facebook, Twitter, Mint, DropBox, Evernote, IMDB, Hulu+, Netflix, HBO Go, the Google Apps Suite (Play, Google+, HangOuts, Chrome etc.)\n\nRESULTS MAY VARY\nYet from the other reviews you read here, you'll see some people are having a grand time and flawless performance with their Samsung Galaxy Note 8 -- so your results may vary. But for me personally, the Nexus devices work best  the Samsungs are too tempermental for my taste. When they work, they're a joy to use. When they don't work, I feel like flinging it across the room."}

In my mind this is the *only* mid-size tablet that gets pen input right, which is unique.  The digitizer based screen is a HUGE benefit and makes note taking or sketching very pleasant.  I use this every day for taking notes and it actually works -- fast and accurate.  AND one of the least-often touted advantages of the digitizer is the fact you can *hover* buttons in a browser, so pull-downs and other menus are actually usable.  No other tablet -- iPad or otherwise -- can do that.\n\nI have also looked at tablet PCs from Microsoft, Sony, etc but keep coming back to the Galaxy Notes as the best option for portability, features, app selection, and price.  Even now after the release of Nexus 7 and iPad mini retina I still think this is the best tablet for artists or note takers.  If you just need a tablet for touch, I agree with other reviewers that you can get a better bang for the buck with a Nexus 7 or non digitizer-based tablet.\n\nOf course, no product is perfect so here are some things I would want in the next version:\n- Higher res screen, 1080p or better\n- Bigger stylus with more weight (I bought a separate Samsung stylus, don't use the original)\n- Better battery life -- I get about 1 day with heavy use, 2 days with light use, 2.5 days at standby.  Would prefer 3-4 days of juice.\n- Better case/cover options -- the official Samsung case is flimsy and others are not as high quality as iPad equivalents"}

Had a Blackberry Playbook that took FOREVER to come on.  Bought a mini iPad. Horrible screen resolution.  Returned the iPad and sold the others.  Bought this instead.  I am loving it!\nPerfect size! Not heavy at all but feels quality.  People complain about the plastic but I don't know what the fuss is about.  It actually looks very nice and does not feel as slick as the mini iPad (I use one at work - school purchase.)\nMy handwriting isn't very good and yet the S pen gets most of it correct when doing writing to text.  Easy to fix mistakes. I love being able to write on this thing! You can change the size of the line that it writes and change the color, too.  You can write with a pencil tool or highlighter, too.\nl downloaded EZ PDF to use for seminary.  I usually print off hundreds of pages a semester. No more!  Downloaded Avery photo editing to use.  Downloaded AVG mobile security.  All were easy to download and access.  Also downloaded some of my old stuff.\nPlugged in an old mini sd card from an old phone (1 G!!)  Loaded some pictures on it and it works great!\nl especially LOVE the ability to take screen shots with the S pen. I took some screen shots to use for my children's sermon tomorrow and pasted them into S note. Works great!\nI tried Awesome note and thought I would love it, but I actually like the S planner better.  I have input my calendar stuff and tasks.  You can view by day, month, year, tasks, or list - which includes your tasks and calendar stuff, too.\nThe virtual keyboard is pretty nice. I am using it to type this. Takes longer than the computer but I can't put this thing down!\nBattery life isn't bad so far.  Lasts as long as my Macbook does.  I have the brightness set pretty low (easier on my eyes). I'm getting a full day with surfing, S note, etc. I turn off wifi when I'm not using it.  I've been using it for hours and I haven't noticed a concern.\nThis thing also records!  Sounds good, too.\nHave had no problem connecting to wifi through my hotspot.\nThis will fit perfectly in my purse.\nI did a ton of research before buying this, and I am very happy with it.

Doesn't glitch like Note 8. Note 8 cannot play pinball arcade, for example, due to lagging, that my S 4 has no problems with. The 2gb memory means nothing. Tegra 4 has superior processor.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "l have been an apple user for many years.  I wanted a new tablet but I was not looking for an Apple product.  I researched the new Samsung Note 2014 10 inch and thought...that was the tablet for me.  I resigned myself to saving the money (cost is high).  But, on a drive home with my husband we started a pros and cons list...and I discovered that what I wanted was in this product.\n\nPros:\nI wanted the S pen - I travel alot and need to take quick notes. A very quick settings change allowed me to have a note \"pop up\" when I take the S pen out.  For me, this is a big plus. I can write (amazing) a quick note and save.\n\nI am not a gamer,  so I needed my work apps to function on this tablet. They do!! My point is I was not looking for something that could process a game quicker, but allow me to work off the tablet with the S pen seamlessly.  This tablet does that.\n\nLastly,  I was concerned about being able to function day to day on the new tablet...meaning can I access and complete all the functions that I did before (with my ipad). I am very happy with that.\n\nCons:\nConnection to my WIFI can be spotty.  I carry a hot spot so I travel with the WIFI version of this tablet and need quick access.  I have only had to restart the tablet once when it could not connect, and have had some issues with the overall connection to a home WIFI. As much as I use it, I thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nLoading web pages can be slow (slower) - I only mention thia as I expected faster processing but WAS able to complete every task I needed\n\nOverall, I am in love, so much so I bought another Samsung for my son.\n\nHonestly, I cannot wait to research and find out more cool tricks that I can exploit to make my day easier.\n\nI recommend."}

This is not just my problem -- the discussion boards are seething with outrage that Samsung's advice is to use factory reset of the tablet to have this feature back (which by the way, Samsung peddles as a distinct feature of note 8). Factory reset is time consuming, poorly defined as to the results of it, and certainly requires backing everything up. Samsung is irresponsible, and so far refused to fix the problem. To verify this post just Google \"Multi Window Note 8 stopped working\". It is a disgrace of customer support.\n\nAdded in 2015: Do not buy this junk of a product -the worst possible support, requires an IT department at home to run it, product designers have utter contempt for users as  attested to by their design choices, google theproduct discussion boards : every imaginable problem has occured with one or another user, and I am one of them. Switching, finally, to Apple, and if Samsung and Android disapppear from the face of the Earth the humanity would benefit.  To hell with the morons who design and sell this junk.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I love my Note 8. It's fast, productive and stylish, You can read all the accolades by other reviewers. My review is focused on the Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) connection. Instead of having a mcro-HDMI it has the MHL. This means I have to connect a MHL adapter to my device, a hdmi cable from the adapter to the laptop, PC or TV (some adapter have built-in HDMI cable), and connect my power adapter from a power source to my MHL adapter. The purpose of the power source is to power the device since HD video can consume a lot of battery. The problem is that I have all these cables hanging from my device. I tried giving a presentation in my class and it was so cumbersome and restrictive because of the length of my power cable. Also, I was concerned about the weight of all the cables on my MHL port. I don't want the charging port on my device to become loose because of these cables hanging off of it.\nMy Kindle HD 7' has a micro HDMI connection. I connect my 6ft micro HDMI to HDMI cable between the device and my laptop/ PC or TV and give seamless presentations, or watch Prime, Netflix, Youtube, etc without a hitch. With the Note 8 it is cumbersome because of the added power source. I have returned to using my Fire HD for giving presentations in professional settings instead of the Note 8.\nI would give the Note 8 a solid 4 stars (even 4.5 stars) if it wasn't for this issue. You would think that Samsung would have thought about this if it wanted to pitch the Note 8 towards students and professionals. As stated, love my Note 8 except for the MHL and giving presentations or watching video on my HDTV."}

As others know, it's difficult to type in another language, especially if you don't have a keyboard with the keys you need. I didn't want to deal with generating more paper waste since I tend to use a lot of scrap paper. This has replaced all my scrap paper. The size of this is perfect that I carry it around with me almost as much as my phone.\n\nThe thing I would recommend Samsung to improve is some sort of wrist recognition by the buttons. when writing on lecturenotes or s-notes, my wrist tends to hit the back button.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I LOVE this tablet!  I did a lot of research before purchasing, read just about every review I could find and I don't have the least bit of regret in the choice that I made.  I bought this to replace an iPad 32GB 1st generation that was starting to behave erratically now that the Apple updates were no longer updating its older software.  My old iPad had been a gift from my husband and had sufficed me well enough over the years but the fact that Apple had essentially phased it out of their updates was frustrating and I wanted something with an expandable memory that wasn't going to cost me an arm and a leg.\n\nMy biggest hesitation was over whether to purchase the 8.0 or the newer 10.1 2014 edition.  I'm used to the larger size but the sizable price difference between the 8.0 and the 10.1 really made me question whether I had to have the larger screen.  In the end I decided that I could adapt to the smaller screen and it really hasn't been a problem at all.  I've had my Note for less than a week and I'm already completely comfortable with its size.\n\nThis thing really blows my old iPad out of the water.  I can't speak to how it compares to the newer ones but there's NO comparison to my old one.  My old iPad was essentially an entertainment device, I could use it to watch movies, read books & surf the web, but it was never a very useful productivity tool.  The S Pen is fantastic, although it did feel a little odd at first simply because I wasn't used to using one.  The handwriting-to-text function is really cool and is remarkably effective at translating your writing.  I've had to correct it on a few things but that's really only been when I've allowed my handwriting to deteriorate into total scribble and I don't have particularly neat handwriting to begin with so I didn't have high hopes for this function but it has impressed me quite a bit.\n\nI work remotely so I also wanted to make sure that I could use this as a tool for work.  I'm able to log into Citrix Gateway and access my remote desktop exactly as I do on my computer in my home office. This has been incredibly handy already in the last few days as I've had a terrible cold and spent several days working from my couch.  The S Pen is perfect for this as it's like having a tiny portable mouse for your tablet.  Anyone who's ever connected to a remote desktop on a tablet or phone can attest to the fact that it's REALLY hard to navigate effectively if you're using your finger because everything on the screen is so tiny.  I spent two hours yesterday evening working on updating data in an Excel spreadsheet with over 700 rows in it and didn't run into anything that I can do on my computer that I wasn't able to do from my Note.\n\nAfter registering my Note I received an email confirming my registration but never received an email with the advertised Samsung Perks.  I contacted Samsung Customer Support via Facebook and they gave me an email address to contact and told me what information to include.  I sent an email last night and this morning already had a response with the missing information for how to access the Perks so A+ for Samsung's Customer Service as well.  I really couldn't be more satisfied with this tablet!"}

It seems a little pricey for such a small tablet but its packed with a loaded  with many options. is it worth to buy? It depends on you?how much you want to spend.

I bought it to be dual purpose @ home and @ work where I take a lot of notes on the fly as a social worker (which is why I chose the 8 over the 10.1) and the s pen was the selling feature for me. The write to text and I are still having a few disputes because it doesn't quite understand my shorthand.  I am guessing there is probably away to train it that I haven't figured out yet.  Otherwise, it has been exactly what I hoped for, which is an integration of laptop functionality with the fun of Smartphone apps.  Oh, I also wish Verizon accepted the Note 8 in its data plan like they do the 10.1because I don't always have access to wifi, but maybe that will happen over time.  Definitely worth my $."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "This Note has it all.  I can't think of anything you need to do that can't be done on the Galaxy Note 8.0.  It is fast, easy to operate, especially with the hidden stylus ready to pull out for note taking.  You can even record, while taking notes!  The display colors are sharp. Photographing, videoing, recording, all of it makes for ease of tasks, and fun too.  The Note is so easy to carry.  it is so light, and fits right into your purse. Some models are phones, with simm cards inside.  I have the Wifi only.  The draw back to this is you must have Hot-Spot on your mobile phone to activate wifi in areas where there is no signal.  Of course you phone company charges extra for Hot-Spot each month.  I pay $20.00 to Sprint.  If it were operated as a phone, it would always be accessible to the internet through your plan.  If you are an Androidite as I am, you will LOVE your Galaxy Note 8.0.  I have the S4 phone, love it too."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "Is there a 0 star rating?  Originally I rated this 5 stars....read on for the dire consequences....\n\nI am updating my review 4 months later after spending 6+ hours on the phone today with Samsung.\n\nDO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!\n\nAt this point, I would NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCT AGAIN!!!  Like NEVER EVER!!!  I just spent OVER 6 hours on the phone with customer service/technical support and remote-in people.  I believe that this is about the updates which totally ruin the device.  As you can see by my initial review below, I loved the device initially.\n\n  I did not do any updates for over a month, not even the initial ones with this replacement device from Amazon.  At that point, I was loving the machine.  Then, I found that the initial updates made irreversible changes, even with rebooting and factory data reset it did not solve the issues.  They also told me once you do the updates, the only way to get the \"known bad updates\" off of the device is to send the device to them for a few weeks for them to get it to out of box condition.  They refuse to send new device or give refund.  I started calling in mid January with these issues.  I was told they would be fixed with the next update.  Wrong!  Instead, things have just gotten worse and worse WITH EACH UPDATE.  More things wrong with every update.  Do not update your device!!!  Even one of the tech people says he has automatic updates permanently off.  I should have returned to Amazon in January as it was still under warranty, however, Samsung reps kept telling me the issues would be fixed with the next update.  Nothing got fixed.  Things only became worse.  MUCH WORSE!!!\n\n1. The S-Planner calendar in List mode puts your calendar items on the WRONG DAY.  But, it doesn't shift everything to the wrong day, only some things, so you can't just mentally think everything is one day off as you don't know which items are on the correct day and which are on the wrong day.\n2.  I am bounced off the internet for no reason with the apology \"internet connection is lost\", however, there was no problem with the internet connection at the location I was at, it was the device.\n3.  I get com.android. is not working message and it bounces you off everything, internet and all.  Everything you were doing is lost.\n4.  The Awesome Note HD and S Note programs will just quit with no backup to what you were doing.\n5.  Polaris files disappear without notice after saving.  One actually turned all text in one file into a \"?' with a dark diamond around it after saving while Samsung rep was remotely connected.  They still won't replace device.\n6.  There are tons of other things wrong that a Factory reset did not fix.  They want to take 4 weeks to repair and give me back the same device. Without my data of course, as that is of no concern to them.\n7.  Not a one of the Polaris files are in the document folder under My Files, not even the PDFs, not the ones I actually typed in, etc.  Good luck finding your documents when they are not where they are suppose to be.  But then again, they just may not exist anymore, so you better check for all your documents regularly to assure they still exist.\n8.  There were no documents in the my files section that were for Awesome note either.  I was told by Samsung reps that they were suppose to be there.  I can only see them under the Awesome Note application.\n7.  There are many more issues, but I am tired of typing about them....  It belongs in the scrap pile when you cannot even offload your data from it.\n\nI am tired of dealing with them for 3 months.  I have been on the phone for OVER 6 hours just today and I still have not been able to get my data off the device (with the help from both the tech support and remote help people) and they still cannot tell me how to off-load all my data to my computer.  What is with that?  Yet, they will take it back for 4 weeks to put it back to out of box condition, although all the updates will still be on it.  And all of my data that I cannot retrieve will be OBLITERATED!!!\n\nSo, without being able to move my data off of the Galaxy Note 8, they are offering to wipe the device, (after I send it in to them).  They do not understand that I may actually need some of that data and that IT WILL NOT BE RETRIEVABLE AFTER THEY WIPE IT.\n\nBOO ON 'EXECUTIVE' CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR SAMSUNG.  THEIR POLICIES ARE RIDICULOUS.  THEY CANNOT GIVE ME A NEW DEVICE TO LOAD MY DATA TO, SO I AM TOTALLY OUT OF LUCK.  I HAVE TO KEEP THIS PIECE OF CRAP BECAUSE I CAN'T OFFLOAD MY IMPORTANT DATA.  SAMSUNG does not know how to offload my data.  If I hear them say they can only do and such one more time (which includes throwing away my data, I will croak.\n\nI will note that I did speak to a couple of tech people and one of the remote people were very helpful in trying to get to the bottom of the issue, but when they leave you saying that they have to do further research to see if it is even possible, then there is no hope.  They connect you to executive customer service who tells you to send it in.  With your data still on it.  SamSUNG STINKS!  DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG PRODUCTS!\n\nIF Samsumg finally gets off the stick and fixes this issue, I will re-post here, but I am guessing that this was a total waste of $400.00 and countless hours of my time as I have been trying to get this fixed for 3 months now.  I could seriously use that money for things other than a broken box.  I'm going back to paper and pencil, at least nothing happens to a paper calendar and paper notes, etc.  Daytimer here I come.  Larger sure, but you won't lose all your data because the box doesn't work right and the company won't do the right thing and replace it despite their people not being able to fix it.\n\nHere was my original review:  Lots to love with this little tablet.  The pen, to be able to convert your handwriting to text.  Voice recognition, so you can speak to write a note in text.  Lots and lots of little surprises of what this device can do.  The 360 degree photos are great!\n\nCouple of things not quite right, so I am sending back for another:\nIt says it is 16GB.  When you open it up it clearly says it only has 9.85GB TOTAL.  So get the 64GB card.\nThe calendar is great and morphs into different views.  The problem is, in list view, things end up on the wrong day.  In the monthly calendar view they were on the correct day, list view and a couple of the other views, some of the items were on the wrong day, some on the right day, even when looking at one certain day.  Tried reloading, but nothing got this fixed so am getting another.\nThere are times when the handwriting feature does not work, even when  try to put  in the mode.  Can't figure out y."}

It has made both the work and play I use the device for so much easier.\n\nThere are only 3 things that kept me from giving this 5 stars:  The cost (which I'm sure you've noticed), the placement of the power button (too close to the Volume Toggle, i sometimes hit the power button by accident), and the speaker placement (both speakers are on the bottom when in portrait mode.  When watching videos in landscape mode, the speaker placement means that you don't get balanced audio).\n\nI recognize these problems are very small (almost petty), and besides these little things, the tablet is fantastic.  I highly recommend this tablet for anyone who will be using the tablet for more than reading emails and light web surfing.  The S Pen gives so much more versatility and functionality than I've had with any other Tablet to date."}

If you have used wacom pens before and want them then this is the tablet for you.  It was kinda of expensive when I bought it, but because of the wacom pen I expected that.  I personally don't use the pen that much, but I tend to find it easier to write things than type then out on a tablet keyboard. The only downside to this product is that much of the pen support is wrapped up in samsungs software, which makes using custom roms a problem if you stil want pen support.  Samsung is also pretty slow on their updates and their updates aren't the best either."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "Buyer Beware:  I purchased the Samsung 8.0, expecting to have 16 gigabytes of usable internal memory because Samsung and the dealerships advertised this tablet as having 16 gigabytes of internal memory. However, when I bought and activated this Samsung tablet, I learned that we have access to a little over 9 of those 16 gigabytes advertised.\n\nNow, I am not new to the tablet market and believe it is reasonable to expect 16 gigabytes of usable internal memory when the product advertises this memory and shows 16 gigabytes on the box in which the product is packaged. Therefore, I cannot help be feel that some level of false advertising was used here.\n\nThe other storage-related issue that bugs me about the way Samsung packages its information is that when I purchased a product with supposedly 16 gigabytes of internal memory, it also sells the concept of  allowing me to add my own SD micro card of up to 64 gigabytes. This feature was a major selling point for me. This seemed reasonable to me since 16 gigabytes is not that much device memory anyway. So imagine my surprise when I found that the Android OS and some of its apps limit my use of that 64 gigabytes of memory on my SD card.\n\nAlthough the Samsung 8.0 camera allows me to change the storage  from the internal memory to the SD card, many other apps like the Google Play Books does not. Since one of the reasons I purposed the Samsung 8.0 was to read my purchased books on Google Play Books, I was very surprised and dismayed to learn that over 3 gigabytes of my usable 9 gigabytes on the Samsung Note 8.0 were taken up by five books. This is unacceptable.\n\nIronically, I do like the overall speed, functionality, and form of my Samsung 8.0. However, had I known all these limitations to and misleading information about the storage size and SD limitations, I would not have purchased this product. I am only writing this review so that you have this information before you purchase this product. If the storage restrictions are not an issue for you, it is a decent product. Otherwise, you might see what else is available for you use. Thank you."}

I'm glad I did.\n\nThe screen has better resolution than the ipad mini.  Smooth graphics sweeping thru the homec screens or the apps.  I find that the size is perfect size for holding as well as to viewing video.  Video is a main reason of this purchase, and I use it for that daily.  The stylus is a great addition to have also.  Apparently WACOM styles technology is in this tablet and it's a steal compared to buying a WACOM tab separately. The one thing that's bothersome is the stylus, though precise, is not very accurate comparing the stylus point in relation to the cursor that corresponds on screen.\n\nI run Netflix and play my own movies transferred to the external SD card I installed.  32 GB gives you plenty of space.\n\nThe learning curve is not that difficult for Apple die-hards.  I opened it up and just dove in.  I still haven't read any documentation that came in the box and VERY little of the online user manual.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I had a samsung tab 3  8.0 and thought I would upgrade to the note 8.0. After using the note for a few days I'm really questioning why the price difference on these two devices. The note has a faster process but honestly it hasn't made much of difference to my user experience - it seems about the same to me. Even though i was well aware that the note has a broader bezel than the tab 3 it was still a big let down when i actually received the note in hand. In comparison to the tab 3 it truly looks and feels like an older model tablet. So for those who are all into appearance the tab 3 takes this one hand's down. The s-pen or my new obsession as I call it is a really cool device if you can get it to work properly. My experience has been difficult with the s-pen because when trying to write with the pen my hand is constantly pressing the return button as well as the other options at the bottom of the screen. So although I love the idea of the s pen I find it a little tedious to use, not to mention that the handwriting recogniton is little questionable. Again although I love the\nidea of the s-pen, for a user like myself who uses tablets mainly for watching movies, games and surfing the web I don't find it that useful for much other than being a stylus. Despite my comments I do like this device I don't think the price difference between the tab and the note is justifiable. The tab 3 gave me evrything that I wanted in a nice package and at a great price - I note provides features that clearly i can do without and which is not missed on the tab 3.  To each his own but after using both devices i would recommend the tab 3 over the note."}

(I still have a \"dumb phone.\")  I was all set to get a Kindle Fire, thinking it was a good starter tablet, since all I really wanted to do was read books, do a little internet surfing, e-mail, and maybe watch a few videos.  I read enough negative reviews that it made me think twice, and after seeing the 8 inch screen size on the Samsung in a local electronics store (not too big, not too small, just right!), and playing with the stylus for drawing and note taking, I was sold, even though it was more than I planned on spending.  The designer in me was also attracted to the white bezel and slim, lightweight design.\n\nI love the home button on the front, the menu button to the left of it that brings up whatever menu goes with the application you have running in front, as well as the return arrow that takes you back to where you were (very helpful for someone like me used to windows). Learning my way around the features was a lot easier and more intuitive than I expected, it's enough like Windows that I think I've figured most of it out in a much shorter period of time that I thought I would.\n\nI'm also using it for things I never expected I would like or need, things like opening e-mailed faxes I work off of every day, rather than printing them out, so this will eventually pay for itself in toner and paper saved.  One of the first applications I added was Kindle, and I've already downloaded a couple books, I'm actually reading more as a result because being able to enlarge the text makes it easier for my not so great vision.  I don't think it works within the Kindle app, but this tablet has some kind of reading feature that allows for adjusted backlighting and I think contrast with the text to make it easier.  Within the kindle app, though, I'm still able to dim it enough in the evening, for example, that it's not too much strain on the eyes.  For me it's fine, since I don't typically read for more than a half hour to an hour at a time, at most.\n\nAlso LOVE the drawing and note taking feature, and I've sketched some designs in S-Note using different colors and pen/pencil/brush types.  No more scribbled notes, sketches and ideas getting away from me on my desk or the bottom of my purse.\n\nI still sometimes struggle to adjust to this screen size after being used to a 24 inch monitor, but I'm getting used to it and I'm so glad I bought this thing.  It's definitely more than a toy.  I just wish I hadn't caved and bought the ESET antivirus software that the sales guy insisted I needed, since I found a free Antivirus app in the Google Play store.  Hope I can return that.\n\nWanted to leave a review since others' reviews of this tablet and the Kindles helped me make my decision.  ;)"}

I charged it two days ago and didn't plan to use it till now, and it's only at 5%.

I had to reinstall a game I'd put a lot of money into... a lot of money... when the tablet didn't restore the data from the game I went to the Samsung website and did a live chat with one of their representatives who told me that for some reason the tablet didn't properly save the data... duh... then he said it was a matter for the application maker and that Samsung would do nothing to reimburse me for the money lost when the tablet didn't save the data properly for restoring the game. I've contacted the application maker but I wanted everyone to know that the restore function on Galaxy Note 8.0 doesn't work and Samsung doesn't care that it doesn't work.

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because it doesn't have adobe flash (I have seen reviews on YouTube showing how to bypass this but I don't want to take that chance and end up damaging the device) and it is not compatible with Amazon Prime videos.\n\nShipping was extremely fast.

Not a big deal for me.  I have never had an issue reading anything on this screen and video still looks great.\n\nmuch more expensive\n\nslower to get updates (the wifi version just got 4.2)  Not really an issue since most Android updates now come through the Play Store service.\n\nhas a dedicated \"menu\" button instead of an app switch button.  A dedicated menu button means that you never know when a menu button is actually going to do something, where as an onscreen menu button only shows up when it has a function.  All Samsung devices are built this way, and it is a poor design decision.\n\nSamsung Touchwiz is kind of ugly, but you can install your own launcher and you will never see it outside of the system menu and notification shade.\n\nSo for me the biggest drawback was the price difference.  I purchased mine and my wife Note 8.0 tablets as referbs and they work great.  But if you have to buy new, I think the price difference makes the Nexus 7 a better buy."}

The reason for four stars is that when you power up the Note, you can see light bleed through on the dark screen.  It is not really significant and only on the bottom.  Called Samsung and they said it was normal for the Note.  Actually did some research and apparently this is a difficult problem that all companies face with regard to this type of screen-Apple included.  Most I suspect will not be fazed by this, in fact it only reminds me when I boot the device up.  Have not had any other issues with the Note as yet.

Samsung's S Planner app didn't synch well with Google calendar so i had to download the latter separately.\n\n5.  big disappointment on printing capability.  you can't print to anything but Samsung printers.  i have a Brother printer and so i downloaded iPrint&Scan from Brother.  it was funky and clunky and did not print well at all.  perhaps one drawback with going with Samsung tablet rather than Google Nexus.  don't know but i'm guessing that the Nexus probably supports other printers since their Android version is generic.\n\n6.  i'd take google voice over samsung's any day.\n\n7.  loaded a bunch of other apps to make it \"complete\".  some of these really should be generic and native to android.\nsome of my favorite apps include...\n - accuweather\n - adobe air & reader\n - amazon kindle\n - audible\n - bbc news\n - bloomberg\n - camcorder\n - compass\n - xe currency\n - dropbox\n - google earth\n - yahoo finance\n - firefox\n - flightaware\n - gasbuddy\n - gmail\n - google sky map\n - kitchen timer\n - google maps\n - merriam webster\n - netflix (it works!)\n - npr news\n - ny times\n - wall st journal\n - orbitz\n - overdrive media console\n - peel smart remote\n - realplayer\n - roku\n - scan\n - scribd\n - seatguru\n - skype\n - smart voice recorder\n - soundcloud\n - stopwatch\n - translate\n - vidcon\n - waze\n - youtube\n\nmaybe the next version of this tablet will be improved."}

Most of our teachers post their powerpoint slides as a pdf file. I use an app called EZ PDF Reader on this tablet to annotate them during class. The pen is so precise and lets me take notes as well as if I were taking them on paper. It also makes it easy to always have access to my notes as I upload them to dropbox. If I don't have a pdf to take notes on, I have found an app called Papyrus that mimics lined paper perfectly.\n\nI debated between the 8 inch and 10 inch versions of the Note not knowing if the 8 inch was going to be large enough to take effective notes. With the high resolution screen and the precision of the s-pen though it has worked well.\n\nThe tablet is also fast. It has been able to handle everything I have thrown at it from multitasking, to intense graphics games, to streaming video. I also love the fact that I can have two apps open side by side (a feature that is currently only available on the Note series from what I understand)! I've used this feature to have something like a website open on one side while I take notes on the other.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend this tablet to students who would like to ditch taking paper notes to save space and have ready access to their notes at any time!"}

The Galaxy Note 8.0 beats them all for me.  It's the perfect companion for the Note II, using the same apps, but for browsing and reading Kindle books it's much easier.  WiFi only, in case that's a concern, but I use it mostly at home so have no issues with that.  I'm more likely to use the S Pen on the 8.0 than the II, but having three means of entering text (swiping, voice, and handwriting) on either device fills all my needs and moods. The 8\" screen is vivid, and the size of the tablet makes using it while I'm lying down, which I'm likely to do, very easy.  The 7\" would have been too close in size to the phone, and the 10\" was just too unwieldy.\n\nI also bought the Samsung cover, which snaps on and adds pretty much no additional weight or bulk, and it turns the device on and off when opening and closing.\n\nBattery life is rather limited, and the tablet needs to be charged each night, the same as the phone.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 from a 1st Generation iPad and couldn't be more pleased.  The device is compact but has a great screen and the S-pen works well for reviewing PDFs and highlighting (primary functions for me).  It fits in a medical lab coat quite well and holds a charge without issue.\n\nOnly cons are the preloaded Samsung software (messaging, etc.) that I know I'll never use.  Otherwise it's perfect.\n\nI bought mine on Amazon's Warehouse Deals at a significant savings.  While I was initially a bit worried about buying a returned item the return policy eased my anxiety.  Besides preowned appearing packaging I wouldn't have known I wasn't the first owner.  It was definitely worth buying from the Warehouse.\n\n3 month update:  I'm still liking this tablet a lot and has a good mix of productivity and entertainment capability.  I was briefly swayed by the new Google Nexus 7 but this tablet has been a great fit.  The s-pen is indispensible for working with pdfs and when using the note taking software.  It does a great job of capturing my handwriting quickly and accurately.  The included Polaris Office allows one to manage office files on the go and to review presentations without having to buy additional software.  I have used it on multiple flights and the video playback is very nice.\n\nBottom line:  This is a great business and entertainment tablet that is a quantum leap from my iPad 1.  If you don't need to work with highlighting/note taking then the s-pen may not hold a lot of value for you and you may be served better by Samsung's other s-pen-less tablets.  If your priorities are gaming/HD video/the crispest screen then look at the Nexus or retina iPads.  If you want a well-balanced tablet that's reasonably priced and offers the expanded capability of the s-pen then look no further."}

If I had known this, I would not have agonized nearly as much about spending the money for this tablet.\n\nThe only downside was that the screen started to fail after a week and showed colored blocks.  I thought the upgrade or some app was the culprit.  Samsung support was good and after trying a few things, I ended up resetting the Note back to factory settings.  This seemed to work for a few days and then the issues started again.  I worked with Samsung support and saw that pressing the screen was now making it change colors.  Now I knew this was a hardware issue.  Support sent me a link to print the label and shipping was free.  It took less than a week to get the Note fixed and returned (fortunately I live close to a service center).  The Note has worked great since.  One other downside was that I added a 64GB micro SD card and forgot to remove it before sending it in.  The card was not supposed to be touched but it was removed and not returned.  I called Samsung and they promised to send an AMEX gift certificate that will basically cover the cost of the SD card.  The AMEX gift cheque arrived today."}

I can now confidently create finished artwork with it.\n\nThe Note 8 is an outstanding tablet.  It is very capable for media consumption, such as music, video or even ebooks; all in a neat portable package.  I personally bought it for the previous reasons, but also for the possibility of drawing and painting with the most natural input possible.  Using the Layerpaint app, I have integrated it seamlessly into my workflow*; when the mood strikes I just jot a sketch or two and either finish it right there on the spot, or continue at home with my PC.\n\nWhat advantages does it offer against the competition?\n\n1)Wacom technology.  It has 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity, which should make your line work look more natural.  Heck, you can easily calibrate the stylus (and even the app, in some cases) if you dislike the pressure curve or the \"cursor\" precision!\n\n2)The S-Pen has a small tip!  While some people have enough ability to create art with any tool, I am not skilled enough.  Having a smaller contact point with the screen gives me more control and precision, as opposed to using my fingertip or a fat stylus.\n\n3)Can handle high resolution, multi-layer files.  With the app I mention above, I have even created 300 DPI and 600 DPI files.  Why is that significant? Because that's print quality, and you can continue whatever you start in the Note 8 with your laptop and be ready for print or web with minor compromises.\n\nThe one con, and it's a big one, is that currently there are not as many drawing/painting apps as for iOS, but it's a situation that will be resolved over time; Wacom just released an Android based professional tablet that should move things along in that department.  If you look around though, you will find an app or two that will fulfill your needs, and who knows, it could end up becoming an important part of you art routine too.\n\n*My current digital only setup is:  Note 8 + Layerpaint HD + Windows 8 Laptop + Wacom Intuos 3 + Manga Studio EX 5.  I do use a standalone Samsung S-Pen which I tweaked to make the pressure sensitivity a bit firmer.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Manga-Studio-5/dp/B00ANH074Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Manga Studio 5</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Manga-Studio-EX-5/dp/B00E1L1P5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Manga Studio EX 5</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wacom-Intuos3-6-x-8-Inch-Pen-Tablet/dp/B00030097G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wacom Intuos3 6 x 8-Inch Pen Tablet</a>\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-Galaxy-S-Pen-Stylus-Pen-with-Eraser-for-Galaxy-Note-II/dp/B009QW3SGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung Galaxy S-Pen Stylus Pen with Eraser for Galaxy Note II</a>"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "When I first got my hands on the Note about 10 weeks ago I was pretty excited and having a great time with it. The screen, initial battery life, s-pen, and speed of the tablet were great. I come from an all-apple background but have recently switched to Android because of the greater freedom they allow. The first problem that was apparent was actually getting the benefits that the tablet purports to come with such as the Google Play credit. It took me two weeks of back and forth with Samsung to get the credit applied to my google account. A problem, should you look at their facebook support page, seems to be very widely experienced. Disappointing but nonetheless handled and now out of the way. Reckoned it was time for me to enjoy my tablet.\n\nI love the screen, I think 8 inches is just the best size for reading coupled with an excellent screen. The ergonomics are great even wrapped in a case, good weight and an acceptable camera. The tablet is also quite good in power, I play Shadowgun (3D FPS) and it looks great and runs smooth.\n\nThe S-Pen is pretty sweet and enjoyable as a method of input combined with the one-hand ergonomics of the tablet. Nice for scribbling, drawing, and text input. However, according to the adverts I assumed I could use the pen to cut out imagery from a variety of things, like Googlemaps for example, and pull it into an email or note-program and annotate it easily. Turns out this isn't the case at all. Most programs, including the note programs included in the note won't allow the s-pen cut-out images to be imported into them. aNote HD allows it somewhat, but image resolution is ridiculously grainy and illegible if it contains text. I've watched the instructive videos on youtube but they have not illuminated anything new that would allow this. Comments are completely welcome on this front.\n\nQUALITY PROBLEMS ARE KILLING THIS FOR ME\nHowever, within 1 month, and without any drops or rough handling of the tablet (I keep it in a case at all times), a hairline crack starting forming on the top bezel, just above the Samsung logo. I immediately contacted Samsung through their facebook support page but never received a response. Within another week the crack had stretched across the whole top bezel and another one appeared on the upper side of the power button on the side bezel. I again used the facebook page as well as the direct service support on Samsung's website. To this day I have not received any response to my problems. Not only is the build quality lacking on the tablet, but non-existent customer service has radically changed my perception of Samsung's products for the worse.\n\nFurthermore, I purchased the tablet as a computer substitute for graduate school and the Note 8.0's long battery life was one of the primary determinants for purchase. However, unlike the first several weeks of 11 hours, the battery life has dropped by hours and I'm lucky if I get 7 with moderate use and conservative power-settings. If I turn on the Wifi and surf, it may can drop another few hours. Moreover, the battery will often drop very rapidly and have had the tablet suddenly shutdown showing 0% life without any warning (Typically a warning pops at 15 & 5%). When the tablet is around 35% range, it can hit zero within 30 minutes. Charging is also showing irregularity, more than once I have left it to charge overnight, heard the affirmative charging sound, and wake to find it at 0% despite having been 30-40% when I plugged it in (Furthermore I turned it off while charging).\n\nBizarre, and I would assume this tablet is clearly defective but I have so far failed to get anyone at Samsung to pay attention to me. I thought Samsung was the top of the heap in terms of Android products, especially for a tablet that's well-more expensive than its competition. Despite my disagreements with Apple's accessibility, I'm thinking perhaps the hardware and software quality trade-off may not be worth it."}

The media player is great on the go but has drawbacks such as poor battery life, four inch screen, and low specs. 1 GHz processor and 486 MB RAM. My mom opted to buy one for me as I didn't have the money to afford one.\n\nToday I found at Staples they were selling it for $299.99! But I went over to Best Buy and they price matched Staples as my mom was buying other items from there. I wanted the black color, instead of white and brown was unavailable. Originally I wanted to buy the Google 7 32 GB but passed on it. I read average reviews online and spoke to people who didn't like using it. Also ASUS has poor customer service in helping and fixing problems.\n\nWhen I came home, I opened the brown box and began to use it. Very easy to use. Thankfully Samsung still uses Micro SD cards. The tablet loads up immediately as well as the Micro SD card. The sound is fantastic! If you think two small speakers can't produce great sound, think again! I didn't have to raise the volume way up. I still have it on low and the sound is loud. Easy to use interface. Long battery life as long as you don't run games and video's all the time. I like to browse the internet quickly. But this is thanks to the 1.6 GHz Quad-Core Processor with 2 GB of RAM.\n\nMy family has owned Samsung products for many years. We never had problems with any of them. TV's, camera's, Refrigerator, and now our first tablet. Will will continue to buy Samsung."}

I have an older iPad (2nd Gen) that is still up to  date, but  this Samsung has a lot of advantages over the full sized iPad. First, the Samsung Note 8.0 has an SD slot and I can add additional storage space for a very small cost. Second, the size, this tablet is the size of the iPad mini (I have a full size iPad). The Note 8.0 is much lighter, smaller and it fits in my purse. I can access my work e-mail via the touchdown app (not a huge fan of the app, but it is what my employer requires and it functions), I can easily connect the tablet to a wireless keyboard, and it is easier to read a book on the Samsung Note 8.0 than on a full sized iPad.\n\nA second important comparison. My husband bought a Verizon Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 for me as a gift. It was $100 more than the regular Tab 2 because it was compatable with Verizon and this Note 8.0 cost  $100 more than the Verizon Tab 2 and it is not 4G LTE. Within 11 days I maxed out the  Tab 2. The Tab 2 has 1GB of  RAM and this was not enough to support all of the things that I wanted my tablet to be able to do. The guy at Best Buyin the  Samsung department told me that sure I could switch and use my iPhone 5 to access the internet as a hot spot when I was not near Wifi, but that it would  not  be  very fast or as smooth as the Tab 2. I paid the additional $100 and upgraded to the Note 8.0 any way. This was  the best decision!!! This tablet is so much faster than the Tab 2!!! I am so happy that I made the switch!!!\n\nIn the end, there are some things that I prefer to do on the iPad and based  on the  technology there are some things that just work better  on the Apple iOS than on Android, but  if  had to pick between the ipad or ipad mini and the Galaxy Note 8.0 I would pick the Note 8.0 hands down.\n\nI hope this helps you and if you have any questions I will do my best to answer.\n\n9/29/13 - the other day I tried to watch an Amazon instant video  only to find that Flash would not work and even though an Amazon video android app exists it will not work on this or other Samsung devices. I was going to drop this by one star but this appears to be an Amazon decision, not a Samsung decision. It appears that the only Android device that will work is the Kindle Fire. Unfortunately Amazon will let this app work on Apple devices just not other Androids. This is frustrating, but ultimately I decided this was an Amazon issue and not an issue with the device. I do wish it would run Flash, but apparently the only tablet that can run flash is the new windows tablet. Hope this is helpful!"}

It weighs the same amount as my Nexus 7 (1st edition) by feel and according to my digital food scale. It is thinner than Nexus 7.\n3. I do like the 1 inch bigger screen, it is nicer to read on.\n4. I like the Memory expansion capability for micro-SD. However, App2SD programs can't move my programs to my memory card. I don't want to root it.\n5. It has better speed than my Nexus 7.\n6. I like having more memory and storage so that I don't have to watch my consumption much.\n7. I like the multi-window feature to look at 2 apps at once.\n\nCons:\n1. If not using a case, I like the grip feel on the back of the Nexus7. The Note 8.0 is smooth and slick.\n2. I would like this better if the bezels were thinner, The bezels are about .5 inches length sides, and about .75 on the width sides.\n3. It goes through battery quicker than Nexus 7. It isn't horrible though. It would be nice to only turn on extra CPU cores when you really need them.\n4. I miss Android 4.3 like on my Samsung S4. Samsung should send out an update to bring us up from 4.1.2.\n5. It could use a smaller price point.\n\nOther thoughts:\n1. The screen is the same resolution that the Nexus 7 has, so no big change.\n2. I'm not sure about the pen, it works, but unless you are already a note taker, or doodler, I'm not sure it provides me any useful feature.\n3. I'm not sure the differences between Note 8.0 and Galaxy Tab 3 8\" is worth the extra $80. (i'll update as I discover more things)\n\n4. Adobe is lame for not supporting Flash on these anymore, but you can still install if you search for Archived Flash Player or visit [...] There are still so many apps out there that support Flash and I haven't seen anything quite take its place yet.\n\nIf Google still had their 8 or 9 inch tablet that also had micro sd for storage, I would probably lean towards Google.\n\nI guess the biggest things to decide on are:\nWhat size of a screen do you need?\nWhat screen resolution do you want?\nHow much storage do you need?\nHow much RAM do you need?\nDo you need quad-core or will dual-core suffice?\nDo you need the S Pen feature?\n\nUpdate 9-14-2013:\nBattery, While yes it drains faster than the Nexus 7, it is not bad. After optimizing my battery with Battery HD and then 100% charge, it reads:\nMusic Playback  Internet Browsing\n8h 20m  WiFi: 12h 30m\n\nVideo Playback  Talk Tim (VOIP)\n16h 40m  WiFi: 10h 0 min\n\nSo far after having this device for 9 days, I have found good use for it. Here Are some of my favorites:\n1. Remote Control (like any software you have to find the one that works for you. The Peel Smart Remote that comes with it does not meet my needs, but it controlled my TV, Blu-ray, and Receiver.\n2. E-mail. My several personal emails, my work email, and my university email, which is the new Office 365 account.\n3. Church. I can load all my scriptures, hymns and other studying materials.\n4. Financial. Mint.com to see where my money is going and how much is spent on fast food.\n5. Inventory. Movies, Posessions, what is needed at the grocery store, etc. (Even with a barcode scanner!)\n6. Books and magazines including all my geeks stuff that I am interested in.\n7. Movies and TV shows.\n8. Communications like facebook and Skype\n9. Doodling\n10. Calculators. standard, scientific, graphing, and handyman that understands fractions that a tape measure uses.\n11. Games. All sorts. For me, for my kids, it seems to be great for this.\n12. Flashlight for looking for items you lost in the movie theatre after the movie is over or sneaking into your bedroom while your wife is sleeping and trying not to wake her up because you spent all night trying to figure out new and wonderful things to do with your tablet."}

I purchased this device  on August 15 and used for 3 weeks now. There is one thing that I want to inform you before you purchase this device.\n\nIf you want to purchase this device, DO NOT update your firmware until Samsung releases firmware update 4.2.2, meaning use As-Is for now.\n\nFirmware issue!\nAfter the purchase, there were at least 3 firmware updates from Samsung and the latest firmware came with touchscreen freeze function which made this tablet pause for 3 ~ 5 seconds. Yes, touch response literally freezes. So I contacted Samsung tech support and they recommended hard reset of the device. I went to XDA Developer website and found there were so many others who experienced the same as I did and do. Worst part is that Samsung is not aware of this issue.\n\nSamsung has been releasing Android 4.2.2 (current version is 4.1.2) which has the fix for this issue, but there is no release date available for Wi-Fi version.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate on 10/7/2013\n\nSamsung finally released 4.2.2 and touch screen issue resolved with the update.\nBUT!!!!! now I notice that internet application closes out when it tries to load flash player on some websites. Samsung should have tested thoroughly. Note 10.1 was great, but it seems like 8.0 will have few more bugs to fix!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate on 11/20/2013\n\nI did not notice until recently that you are now able to store some programs on SD card. This was one feature that was blocked until the update on 10/7/2013. What does this do? It frees up your internal storage by moving some of your large size apps to SD card. Do note that note 8.0 only has 16GB space, so this will enable you from running out of your internal memory. Few of the previous galaxy phones had this feature, and now on the note 8.0. I was able to move appox. 3GB data to my 32GB SD card. Note 8.0 vs NEXUS 7? Now you may want to re-think because NEXUS 7 does not support micro SD. However, flash player issue is not still resolved...just to remind you."}

Prior to owning the Note 8, I've tried just about every tablet available. IMHO, this is the first tablet that has really brought all the processes together on one device for me.\n\nIf you're the type of person who likes to plan out (to the extent we can) every \"thing\" in your life, including Plan B & C, then the Note 8 just might be just the device for you!

Its not SIRI. Its not Vlingo. Its not Google Now. Its not as integrated as Samsung thinks and its not good. The solution is simple as all you have to do is use Google Now. While S-Voice does plug in to the Samsung apps very well, the problem is that the Samsung apps aren't as good as what they're designed to replace.\n\nThe words of Jesse Pinkman allude to a serious problem: MAGNETS, BITCHES! Often found in smart covers that automatically wake up your tablet, they automatically destroy the GN8s magnetically-driven hardware that allow the S-Pen to work so well. They create dead-spots in the screen.\n\nThe solutions are many: find a cover that uses weak magnets, which is to say: spend the extra money on the OEM cover; for the same price as the OEM cover, purchase the protection overkill of the Otterbox Defender case made for the GN8; hunt for a case that doesnt use magnets and still offers good protection.\n\nTHE MEDIOCRE:\n\nThe price is another problem: at $399, its pretty steep for a small tablet not running iOS or Windows 8RT, both of which are much more integrated into the professional environment the GN8 is designed to serve. While the S-Pen is incredible, and its integration makes it a steal when compared to the thousand dollars you have to shell out for a Surface Pro, most people aren't the kind of users that will actually get a value-added experience with it. My suggestion is to go with the N7.2 or Galaxy 3 Tab 8.0, which still comes with great perks and allows you to control your TV (more on this later).\n\nGranted, the GN8 comes with a ton of perks as long as you buy it by 30 September 2013 [...] and it is on sale at Staples for $329.99 (at least it was when I wrote this review).\nThere is also another price work-around to be considered: buying refurbished. At $299.99, you get all the perks of the special promotion and you don't have to pay sales tax (its used). By the time I factored in all the tax savings and perks, I paid a bit less for a GN8 than I would have for the only other affordable tablet that could meet my needs: the second-generation Asus Nexus 7 (N7.2).\n\nThis isn't your typical used car version of a refurbished item. The packaging is complete, the device looks great and honestly in my experience, the failure rate for factory-refurbished equipment has been lower than that of new equipment.\nNot to mention its better for the environment AND the domestic economy when you consider Samsung does their refurbishing right here in the United States.\n\nYou get a decent 90-day warranty you can extend if you want to. I root every Android device I buy, which voids most warranties, so this isn't a major concern for me: you pay your pennies and you take your chances.\n\nBy the time everything was tallied up, I purchased a refurbished GN8, spare chargers (both for a car and AC wall charging), an OTG micro USB to USB adapter (more on that later), a folding Bluetooth keyboard, a case and ChromeCast for only $15 more than I would have paid for the GN8 alone, with California sales tax at my local Staples.\n\nIn-Depth: The 96hr Immersion\n\nThe last four days have seen my experience evolve from fascination to ham-fisted frustration to my girlfriend literally being pulling me away from the tablet by my ear because of blood-blasted (blood-shot doesnt begin to describe it) eyes to now, at this present time, actually feeling an emotional connection similar to the one I feel with my lovely and well-trained dogs.\nSamsung has come a long way with their packaging over the last decade, coming close to the unboxing experience Apple products have soiled the electronics market with. I know that the recycled materials a bit of propaganda, but I like the message the propaganda sends.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is that the GN8 feels as good in the hand as it looks in the box. It really is a beautiful device, taking full advantage of the slick design that has made Samsungs Galaxy line so successful. It is much lighter than the solid feeling tells the sense of touch it should be and is a very high-quality product when it comes to materials and finish. However, the back is a little too slick to use without having anxiety over dropping it, but a person that uses a tablet without a case probably has advanced-stage syphilis as well and aren't worth knowing.\n\nIve read some reviews that have attacked the use of polycarbonate for the body, saying it feels cheap. There are no signs of poor build quality in this tablet. The same can be said for the GN8s most significant competitor: the N7.2. Both feel solid without feeling chunky.\n\nAs far as durability is concerned, it should be noted that polycarbonate is used in things like safety glasses and bullet-proof windows for a reason: its strong and can take a beating. Metal is cool and feels good, but it also dents and arcs, destroying delicate electronics. The GN8 is also built with the second generation of Cornings Gorilla Glass, so durability of the device itself should be excellent.\n\nThe same cant be said for the metal foil laminate of the bezel around the GN8s camera in back, which is already starting to chip a bit from setting it on my desk when charging. Samsung should have used the same material they did around the perimeter of the GN8s shell.\n\nWhen combined with a portable Bluetooth keyboard (a must if you're serious about getting the most out of your tablet purchase), the entire package comes in at roughly a pound.\n\nThis has been a blessing, because my typical load for a day in the field includes the following: a DSLR with two lenses, assorted filters, an extra battery and USB, HDMI and component cables; a prosumer point and shoot with an extra battery; a stereo microphone with pop filter and table-top tripod, USB cable; a portable solar panel; eight rechargeable AA batteries (to run my mic, mobile phone, flashlights, a portable scanner, the GN8 should it actually run out of power, and a STERIpen water purifier- sometimes when I write that I work in the field, Im being literal); assorted equipment to clean and maintain my camera equipment; pens, markers, highlighters and a notepad; a simple grooming and first/last aid kit (its important to make sure fingernails and calluses are taken care of when meeting clients); a waiters wine opener, Chapstick, gum (because its important to be able to celebrate a new acquaintance whenever you meet her); condoms (because Im an optimist); a cigarette lighter (for what comes after the bottle of wine); a flashlight; a head light; the aforementioned scanner and water purifier; my glasses; cables and power adapters for my phone and GN8; Bluetooth headsets; a Kobo Glo with a few hundred books on it (nothing will ever replace e-ink); a pair of gloves; a small knife; a pair of gloves; a small tripod; two liters of water; and before getting the GN8: a bit seven pound laptop, 1.5 pound spare battery and a one-pound charging brick all packed into a strained assembly of water-resistant fabric that is considered a personal carry-on item!\n\nMost of this equipment is used at least two or three times a week (even the water purifier when Im hiking or don't trust the tap water), and I only want to eat, shower and dress in the morning, so doing a different load-out every day is impractical.\n\nWhat Ive found over the last week is that I can do about 95% of what I need to do, when I need to do it, with the GN8 and it has taken my typical load-out from a shoulder and back abusing 28 pounds to a  comfortably feather-weight 17.5!\n\nRELEVANT LUGGAGE TANGENT: While a backpack would carry my daily load more comfortably, satchels are mandatory for quickly accessing photography gear. Also, the FAA lists backpacks as luggage, whereas a satchel, as long as it fits within the maximum allowable size, is considered a personal item akin to a purse or briefcase regardless how much it weighs.\n\nThe display, which is slightly larger (by the ruler) than the N7.2s, is wonderful once its been optimized for text and reading. Understand that it is a two-step process to make the GN8s screen really earn its praise. First, turn on reading mode in the drop-down settings menu. Then, go into device settings under the display submenu and check the box that optimizes the display for text. It makes reading mode an enjoyable experience rather than a gimmick.\n\nWith those tweaks, the display is so good, I actually prefer the GN8 to the N7.2 when it comes to reading Flipbook and PDFs but Ill still be using my Kobo Glo for long periods of reading e-books.\n\nFor gamers, the GN8 may not have the pixel saturation of the N7.2s tremendous display, but it isn't lacking. About as heavy into gaming as I get is Bards Tale, and it looks and plays great on the GN8 with the high-definition graphics pack. More intense games will make the GN8 stutter a bit, as its graphics processor is a bit dated. However, you're not going to be interested in the GN8 if you're only looking to browse the internet, play games and stream movies: this is not your recreational users tablet.\nTheres also a price to be paid for the N7.2s cutting edge technology: glitches. Google it.\n\nIn addition to an enjoyable reading experience, the GN8 has something the N7.2 should: physical buttons that eliminate the need of assigning precious screen real-estate to navigation icons. These physical keys located away from the screen make the actual display area of the GN8 about 20% larger than the N7.2 with its virtual keys that take up a significant chunk of room on the display. Samsung, like Apple, gets why people instinctually enjoy having a dedicated home button: it makes life easier, even if some technophiles consider them the cumbersome tools of luddites. The dedicated keys make a lot of sense on the GN8: if you're interested in a device that has been designed around a stylus, you appreciate the touch-feely attributes of the entire Galaxy lines design.\n\nThat stylus is a major benefit for people like me: content publishers that need to be able to import, edit and publish multimedia from remote locations. While sketching is great for fun or to make mind maps of projects, the S-Pen isn't just about Paper Artist. Ive found very good uses for the S-Pen when paired with the GN8s impressive hardware.\n\nThe S-Pen is a great device, and I understand why people justify the expense of the GN8 with the statement its all about the S-Pen after using the N7.2 with an aftermarket device. The S-Pen is a bit too thin for me to use for long periods, but I actually prefer navigating around the home screen and most applications with the S-Pen instead of my finger, especially Photoshop Touch (more on that later).\n\nThis isn't a major problem because the Note is designed to take notes. The S-Pen integrates well when digesting information-heavy PDFs, allowing the user to highlight section of text, make notes and quickly integrate and organize them within S-Note.\nMaking the process even more efficient is MultiWindow. The MultiWindow feature is one of the advantages unique to the Note line that Samsung has made better than in the last generation with smoother control and more available applications that support it. Of course, I would like to see even more applications support it because everyone uses multiple windows on their bigger computers, so everyone knows how much of a productivity advantage the capability is. Its a no-brainer application designers need to integrate into their apps.\n\nWhen a beautiful display optimized for reading and highly integrated to the S-Pen input and interface, then empowered with MultiWindow and gestures like swiping the screen with the flat of the hand to take a full screen shot (or circling text and images with the S-Pens button depressed to capture smaller items), I have a hard time believing that any other device could be better for the task of heavy research and study. The GN8 is the honors graduate students wet dream.\n\nAnd theres good news for GN8 users after grad school. To schedule life, S-Planner almost became what I use to work with my Google calendars. Its a fluid and seamless way to do almost everything I need to do with my schedules, but it has one glaring fault because instead of being its own application, S-Planner is not much more than Google Calendar with S-Pen support and a new skin. Unfortunately, S-Planner has all the limitations of Google Calendar when it comes to scheduling.\n\nInstead, Im using another pre-loaded GN8 application for most of my scheduling needs: Awesome Note HD (though I still prefer the endless scrolling agenda list of Business Calendars widget, found here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=netgenius.bizcal&hl=en). Awesome Note HD, like the now-dead Astrid, allows me to set repeating events by the days that need to elapse. Granted, this is a feature I use to do things like remind myself to change the houses HVAC filter, replace the head on my electric toothbrush and give my lovely dog her heartworm and tick medications. While pedestrian, all of those tasks are dependent on the amount of days lapsed and important to me.\n\nNote to Samsung: form a partnership with Awesome Note by folding S-Planner and S-Note into a Note-tablet specific version of their application.\n\nThe GN8 is loaded with a 4,600mAH battery that keeps me moving and producing in the field for my entire day. In the week Ive had it, I have never have to recharge the GN8 before bedtime, and Im not a light user.\n\nThis is my GN8s typical day: I start out by sending and responding to emails in the morning for about an hour during my commute, generally using a folding Bluetooth keyboard or Googles voice recognition input through a Bluetooth headset. Once I get to where Im going my day is spent capturing and creating content, editing content between meetings and giving presentations at my clients offices. On my way home, I participate in social networking, play video games or try to get ahead on media projects that are either rushed, delayed or personal. After my commute, Ill use the GN8 to manage shopping and errand lists on my way home, and once I get home I use the integrated Peel application to control my television and DirectTV!\n\nSpeaking of the IR blaster, it won't allow you to bump files and contacts to other devices like the N7.2s NFC feature. Some have listed this as a detriment, but NFC isn't going to be used in the environment that the GN8 is designed to excel in. Professionals may bump contacts with their phones, but Ive never seen anyone do it with their tablet and Ive seen A LOT of people use A LOT of tablets.\n\nHowever, with the IR blaster found on the GN8 (and not the N7.2), it is a tremendous asset to be able to control monitors and most other devices with the same device you're running a presentation from. With ChromeCast and the IR blaster found in the GN8, Im ready to rock a presentation in most modern offices within a minute and that makes a great impression when dealing with prospective clients that don't have a lot of time to waste.\n\nThats not to say NFC isn't good technology. Its great on a phone, but Im not going to dig out my tablet every time I want to purchase a latte and apple fritter\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is a force multiplier for media professionals because you buy a whole lot of bangs with the same buck. When the ability to set up and control presentation equipment in seconds instead of minutes (or even hours with older stuff) is combined with a massive fuel tank that supports a full work day of use without a recharge, outstanding performance, high-speed connectivity, better productivity, a wonderful display, light weight and a slick design, the GN8 becomes more than a really cool tablet. The GN8 does most of what any mobile professional needs it to do for as long as they need it to do it while saving weight, money, time and, with the S-Pen, it also saves my clients from the indignity of signing my invoices with their finger.\n\nTHE BONUS EDITION:\n\nThis is what you spend the $25 Google Play credit on if you want to get the most out of the GN8s unique features that make this tablet the best small Android tablet on the market:\n\nThe S-Pen and Adobes $10 limited port of Photoshop [...] go together like peanut butter and jelly. I know that there are capable applications out there like Snapseed that will allow most people to do almost everything they need to make their photos pop for Facebook and Pinterest. But Im not blogging about food trucks or touching up selfies: I do stuff with images, video and sound for a living. If I can have Photoshop and do the high quality creating and editing on the go, Im buying it and honestly, itll do at least 95% of what I need it to do, so when compared to the exponentially more expensive desktop application, Photoshop Touch is one of the centurys best deals.\n\nIn addition to that, a $4.99 license for Clesh [...] gives me the ability to edit videos on the go. It works well for most of my needs, though some more complicated projects still require my sedentary equipment because I don't have much patience. I wouldnt recommend Clesh for a smartphone, but on larger displays and the extremely fast WiFi radio built into the GN8, Clesh is a wonderful application that makes the most of the GN8s hardware and S-Pen.\n\nTo round it all out, Audio Evolution Mobile is available for $6.99 [...] and allows me to connect my ZOOM audio recorder to the GN8 via an inexpensive OTG USB adapter. It captures much better audio than the microphones mounted on the GN8, and it allows me to capture, edit and package complete audio tracks while working from my couch or on the long Metro ride home. The S-Pen makes grabbing and piecing together tracks one of the easiest experiences Ive had, and I have complete control over the entire capture process when doing podcasts outside my normal studio.\n\nCompared to the desktop interface, I prefer to edit my audio on the GN8 for a few reasons. First is the S-Pen interface because it makes clicking and scrolling and dragging so much more fluid than the mouse. The second reason has to do with quality. I can listen to it through my cars audio jack or Bluetooth, through wired headphones, Bluetooth stereo and Bluetooth mono headsets. This allows me to make sure it sounds okay across all formats my audience is likely to use without having to suffer the indignity of Microsofts Bluetooth client.\n\nSince I have an OTG cable, I need an app that will help me bring files to the GN8 from its native location, and thats the excellent Nexus Media Importer available at the Play Market for $3.99 [...]. If I don't have to hassle with swapping MicroSD, I don't hassle with swapping MicroSD cards, and Ive already paid myself back a few times with the amount of time and frustration this application saves me.\n\nTo get all those files organized and uploaded to where they need to go, I use the Total Commander file manager [...] and the FTP Plugin for Total Commander [...]. Both are available for free at the Android Market and are the best applications Ive used for my needs.\n\nFor those not keeping track, the above applications cost a total of $25.96 and make the GN8 one of the best editing platforms Ive ever used. So far, I haven't witnessed the 1.6GHz quad-core Exynos processor struggle with the demands of editing or creating professional-level multimedia content. Even if it is slower than a high-quality desktop, I save more time with the S-Pen than Ive wasted on rendering.\n\nIf I need to access a more powerful system, Samsung and Dropbox have teamed up to give GN8 purchasers a free 50GB upgrade. The WiFi radio that comes with the GN8 is one of the fastest Ive used, and Ive moved large files over both public and private hotspots in about the same amount of time my laptop takes. Granted, this is a snails pace when compared to a direct line into a cable network, but for WiFi performance, the GN8s performance impresses.\n\nAlso, the GN8 has one of the best GPS radios Ive used on ANY device! Navigating with GN8 and Google Now takes about 15 seconds less than trying to do the same thing through the dedicated navigation systems Ive used in most cars! It is truly amazing how much work Samsung put into getting the GN8 to work well before releasing it to market.\n\nYou cant say the same thing about the N7.2. Google it.\n\nCombined with Splashtop, all I have to do is upload the media to my Dropbox account, log into the app, wait for my desktop to pop up and tell my hard-core unit at home what to do. While Im meeting with clients, doing work or commuting, my bigger projects are rendering on their own. I can log back in to Splashtop to check the progress of the project from anywhere in the United States, and when its done I can use Splashtop to send it back to DropBox and have my client preview it.\n\nTECHNO-TANGENT WARNING: Even though its more difficult to set up, I prefer the older Splashtop Remote Desktop HD on sale for $8.99 because I can use it any time I want on any network I want without having to rent it by the month.  [...].pad. If programming settings is too difficult, or you find Googles servers too slow for things like gaming, you can use the new and improved Splashtop2: [...]"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I had initially purchased the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 little over a year ago and was formally introduced to the Android platform.  Six months later, I purchased the Galaxy S III and I was captivated by its potentials.  Upon reading the specs and various reviews for the Note 8.0 Wi-Fi, I was impressed.  The first notable item was replacing the 30-pin proprietary charging plug with the micro USB which effectively simplifies the process!  The second element was the dramatic improvement to the S-pen over the 10.1 which makes writing smoother and elegant.  The convenient storage and accessibility when needed in the body of the tablet enables it to be ergonomically clean.  The size of the Note 8.0 is ideal - not as \"small\" as the 7.0 or a large as 10.1.  One word can easily sum it up - mobility.  Yes, it not a direct replacement for a laptop or ultra notebook but, it certainly gets about 90 percent of my work done.  The third factor is the Smart Stay which keeps the screen on as you are looking at it.  This feature negates you from having to constantly touch the screen in order for it not to time-out as in the Tab 2 7.0.\nWith regards to the display of the screen, it still manages to be vivid despite it not being an Amoled.  Colors appear to be true, natural and not washed out when watching movies on Netflix and Vudu.  The processor is fast as I have not experienced any lags and the transitions thus far have been flawless which also makes multi-tasking a great asset to this tablet.  The only negative comment would be the battery life.  It is anticipate that with the 4.2 update this should improve.  In all, this is a fantastic device and I would certainly give it high recommendations.  Good job Samsung!"}

Even though 8 has bigger processor and memory it has noticeable lag issue's up to the 10.1! There's no tablet out there going to top the 10.1, not even samsung's predecessor in what they first said was going to be a 8 inch version of there 10.1 with stronger processors and better battery, they fell short on both categories! Don't get me wrong it's not quite going back to the store just yet, love the form factor up to the 10.1! I personally think that samsung put harsh processor restrictions on this unit! Photo shop touch is not here unlike on the 10.1 and video editor isn't either,  video editor is available via samsung's app store (free) and photo shop touch through play store for a very high 9.99! One of this units highlights is the ease of charging through micro b usb , it's always been a hassle on 10.1 with it's proprietary cable to charge with anything other than a wall adapter! This 8\" of mine will most definitely be getting rooted just to unlock full potential of hardware and to eliminate all samsung's pre loaded push software!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "My OG 10.1\" Asus Transformer TF101 was showing its age, and so it was time for a replacement.  I was looking for a more portable tablet that I could take to school or anywhere without the bulk.  After reading reviews and testing store demos, I narrowed it down to the Nexus 7 2013, Tab 3 8.0, and Note 8.0.  I'm no fanboy to any OS, but the iPad mini was never in the equation simply because I was in the market for Android not iOS.  The decision was tough, but for my needs the Note 8.0 edges them out.\n\nWith all the Nexus 7 2013's great price and high specs, I just couldn't get past the screen size.  The high resolution display has sharp text, but a tad too small for my liking on full web pages and PDF's.  In landscape mode text was comfortable, but viewing height felt narrow.  Coming from rarely having to zoom on a 10\" screen wasn't helping either.  Even though the Nexus 7 is fast, sleek, and updates quickly I wasn't willing to give up 3\" of screen.\n\nSo all that remained was the Samsung Tab 3 8.0 and Note 8.0.  After comparing these further I decided to take the plunge on the pricier Note 8.0 for the increased horsepower and S-pen stylus.  Overall I am very happy with it, despite my few gripes with it.  Transitioning from 10\" to 8\" was painless and found that I wasn't missing the larger screen at all.  The display is surprisingly vibrant and crisp considering it's not an Amoled or IPS tier screen.  Like others mentioned 8\" is the way to go for mobility, weight, comfort, while retaining a sizeable screen.  Text size is better than the Nexus 7 in full web pages and PDF's requiring little to no zooming.  I don't use the Wacom stylus as much as I thought, but it's amazingly handy when you need it.  Performance is snappy and tackles everyday tasks to moderately intensive gaming with ease.\n\nThe only gripes I have, which I've learned to accept, are with Touchwiz, home buttons, and battery life.  Samsung's interface is bloated and looks a little cartoonish to me.  Without rooting I disabled the Samsung apps and features I didn't use, and added a launcher like Nova with minimalist icons for a better look and feel.  Occasionally mine will freeze for a second and then keep going like nothing happened, which I blame on Touchwiz.  It doesn't bother me much since it doesn't occur often, plus it's still ten times better than my old tablet.  Handling the tablet in landscape took some getting used to since it's easy to hit the back and menu buttons on accident, but one benefit is that it doesn't take up any screen.  Also battery life is acceptable not great; with moderate use, some tweaking, and its superior standby, it will get you easily over a day.  Hopefully the 4.2 update will help the battery and performance like it did on the 3G/LTE variant.\n\nAlthough the Tab 3 8.0 performs well in its own right in my opinion the only reason to get one is if you financially cannot or do not want to spend the difference for the Note 8.0.  Even still with Amazon's pricing and $25 Google credit (till 9/30), that brings it down to about a $50 difference, plus you get a faster processor, more ram, and s-pen features.\n\nIf Google made a Nexus 8, I probably wouldn't be writing this review; however until then Samsung stands alone in the 8\" Android category, not including cheap tablets.\nIn the end all three are great tablets, but the 8\" screen, S-pen, and performance on the Note 8.0 fit my needs the best."}

I work in the Pharmaceutical industry and attend many meetings. I use to have to always buy new paper notebooks from all the note taking.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "Have been looking for a tablet with hand written note taking ability. Worked with different stylus on ipad, samsung tabs, Asus tabs, nothing would work. Finally this tablet fulfilled my expectations. The note taking with S pen is very close to using a manual pen on paper. Hand writing to Text works surprisingly well. You need some time to get used to the settings and how to use it effectively.\n\nScreen is great looking better than expected for 189 ppi.\n\nOS works fine without any lags. Multi tasking ability is good.\n\nYes it is little bit pricey, but it's worth if you are using S-Pen. You also get $25 play store credit when you register the note with samsung.\n\nThe only annoyance is that the cover accessory is $50 which is a rip off, but it protects the tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I bought this tablet as a replacement for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 plus. Being a college student, it is wonderful. I am able to purchase ebook textbooks and save money. The screen quality and display are superb for watching movies. I was not overly fussy on the stylus at first but then it became apparent on the multifunctional abilities that it has. I can highlight text and even scribble notes with ease.\nComparing it to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 plus, it is faster at opening applications and offers smoother transition between applications. I am not down grading the abilities of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 plus, but more emphasizing the abilities of the Note 8. I like the slightly larger screen size.\nI did purchase the smart shell case. The wake/sleep function works flawlessly. It saves on battery power and increases the simplicity of use.\nOverall, I am truly happy with the upgrade."}

I just received it today an I'm very impressed with everything. The tablet is amazing. It's very fast an snappy. I use to have the Asus Transformer Prime which was a good table but this is way better in every way to me. I was a little concerned about the resolution of the screen based on the spec's before I purchased the device. After I played with it for a while the screen looks absolutely amazing. So far this device is worth every penny I spent on it. I also have the Galaxy S 4 which is another fantastic device. I love Samsung products. They do a great job on their devices. Also the software on here in fantastic with a ton of features."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I really wanted to like the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0. There is such a great feel to the touchscreen and the way it allows you to move back and forth within the applications. However, as much as I wanted to like this product and learn how to work it I continue to have difficulty. I purchased it approximately two weeks ago and have worked with it for short periods everyday. The purchase was made so that I could keep it at the office and watch my favorite show on Amazon Prime during lunch break. (I can do this on my IPAD) as well as take notes during meetings.\n\nI quickly found watching my programs on Amazon Prime wasn't an option as you need Adobe Acrobat in order to watch TV, movies or video particularly from Amazon Prime (almost unlimited TV, movies with my $80/year membership). Unfortunately, this system isn't compatible with Adobe. So, I tried searching the internet for a fix and found a suggestion to download \"MX Player\"  which would supposedly give me the ability to play any video. Oops, didn't work....still can't play TV or movies unless I purchase them from Google Play. Okay, so nix that. How about I concentrate on the note taking feature with the app S Note. I figure I can still use the pad to take notes during our companies endless meetings.\n\nWell, the S Note application would be wonderful to take notes in if I could just figure out how to work its many features. The basics of writing on the pad are obvious. But, getting too much further than writing and flipping to a new page starts to get a little more complicated. So that's when I started looking, in earnest, for a user manual since my search through the internet wasn't yielding much help. Voila, I googled and found the user manual on-line by searching through Samsung's website. (It was hidden pretty deep). Once I found the on-line manual, I also realized there's a user manual on the pad itself. However, since theres no \"search\" option on the Samsung Galaxy Note I didn't actually \"find\" the user manual - I just happened up on it. Okay, so I started browsing through the user manual and found the following helps for S Note: Select a note template, Compose notes, Insert multimedia files, Using productivity tools, Browsing notes, Viewing notes. Great - but nothing on how to Save a note, Change the name of a note, Save to a particular day, event, etc. So that if I need to find my notes from a particular meeting I'm still not sure how to do this. I tried to change the name of a note and couldn't do it. Neither the on-line user manual nor the Samsung user manual helped me with this very necessary feature. While that's frustrating enough,  I'm sure there are even more features I will need help on that hasn't even occurred to me yet - and I don't have time to muddle through and find out how to use the details of this system by trial and error.\n\nThere are many neat features on this pad. If you have time to play around and figure it out then go for it. If you have $400.00 to spend though, I would suggest an Ipad or Kindle Fire. Either will give you the features you find on this system plus more. As I said, I wanted to like the Samsung Galaxy 8.0, but am sorry to say I'm packing it up and shipping it back."}

There are a ton of apps available.

Then re-install your files. Th external SD card is not effected. Hope they are shipping by now with the 4.2.2 firmware.\n\nUpgrade to two stars because of the problematic upgrade process."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "When I started looking for an ideal tablet a month ago, I was sure that I was going to get the iPad mini. Then I started doing some research and found galaxy note 8.0. It was selling for the same price of $329 at staples, so it was all about the features. The reasons why I finally chose galaxy 8.0 were:\n1. Micro SD slot - This is a big one for me. I can dump all my music and quite a few movies on the card. I can also transfer photos from my SLR onto this and use it almost as a storage device.\n2. Higher resolution, 2 GB RAM and quad-core processor - The resolution, though better than the iPad mini, won't knock your socks off. However, I was pleasently suprised by how nice and vibrant the colors look on this tablet. Also, I think this is the only tablet that offers you 3 different display options: Dynamic, Movie and Standard. The quad core 1.6 GHz processor really shines while playing graphic intensive games.\n3. Android ecosystem - This is more of a personal preference. I replaced my iPhone with an SG3 last year and I found the google ecosystem to be much more open. There's definitely a downside to this, but I like the fact that I don't have to buy adapters every time I want to connect my phone or tablet with an accessory. It all just works, and it is only getting better with time.\n4. S-pen - For a student, this really helps. It completely replaces pen and paper. Also, the tablet comes pre-loaded with polaris office, which can be used to view and edit word and excel documents or view power point presentations. It is really nice and easy to use.\n5. Potability/8 inch screen - This is again a personal preference, but I think 8 inch is the perfect size for a tablet. Not too small, not too big. It is just the right size to carry when you're on the go. It is lightweight and convenient to hold in one hand.\n6. IR Blaster - Hardly a must have feature, but it'll be intereseting to see how well this works with my Samsung TV.\n7. Playstore credit - You get $25 google playstore credit to purchase apps, music or movies when you register the product on samsung website. You also get 3 free months of Hulu, free boingo internet for a year as well as $50 credit towards watch on (I have not used it yet, but when I do I'll come back and update this review).\n8. GPS - Even though this is a WiFi only tablet, I can install applications such as CoPilot and download maps for navigation offline. It only costs $9.99 and you can try it for 2 full weeks before buying. I was going to purchase a new GPS separately, but not anymore.\nOne thing to note before you buy this tablet is the battery life. It is not stellar. It is in fact just okay. But there are things one can do to increase the battery life, especially when the tablet is in sleep mode:\n1. Install juice defender from playstore. Mine is always in \"agressive\" mode. This really helps extending the stand by time.\n2. Make sure WiFi is off during sleep mode.\n3. I get notifications (email, facebooks etc.) on my smartphone. So, there's really no need for me to get those same notifications on my tablet. I also have automatic sync turned off. I sync manually when I open an application.\n4. GPS and bluetooth are on only when I need them.\n5. I use cleanup master and I have the automatic background task kill switched on. I also regularly clean up the background tasks.\n6. I keep the brightness at about 25-35%. It is enough when you're indoors, and it is easy on the eyes. When I am outside, I turn the auto brightness on. I also have the power saving mode on most of the times.\n7. I use avast anti-virus on this tablet as well as on my phone. I don't know how much it helps with the battery but it definitely helps guard against unwanted virses, malware and spyware.\n\nIf you do just this, you should notice a significant increate in battery life. With moderate use, I am able to go through 2 full days before it needs recharging. However, if you're browsing the Internet or playing youtube clips constantly, don't expect the battery to last more than 7-8 hours.\nI have no problem recharging the tablet every 2 days. However, if you're on the go all the time and need the tablet to last more, I'd suggest buying a separate 9000 mAh battery. It is portable and it gives you 2 full recharges. It is not an ideal solution, but atleast you know that just for $50 more, you can go without plugging in your tablet for almost an entire week.\n\nIn the end, I think the reason why there are so many tablets out in the market is because no one tablet is ideal for everybody. Every tablet has it's adantages and disadvantages. The tablet that you buy depends on how you're going to use it and what you're going to use it for.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nUpdate: Some people have been asking about the storage space available for apps on this tablet. You get close to 9.5 gb for applications. Music, movies, pictures and other documents can be stored on a sd card."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I recently purchased this tablet at my local BestBuy to check it out for a few days and then returned it and bought it on Amazon (no sales tax)after realizing that it is definitely the best tablet I've ever used.  This thing packs a punch for many different reasons....here's why:\n\nPackaging:  Easily beats Apple in the packaging of this product.  It comes in a sleek and stylish \"wood\" type box.  The first thing you see when you open it is the tablet itself with a nice screen protector on it (that you have to peel off).  Below the tablet is the charger and USB cable along with a getting started guide.\n\nFirst boot:  The tablet boots right up at about 75-80% battery life.  It is your usual Android experience:  login with your Google account and Samsung account (can use the same credentials) and all of your contacts, apps, settings, etc. are synced to the device.  If you don't have either of these accounts or if it is your first time with an Android device, you can register and get started within minutes.  A very simple setup experience.  Once you get into the device itself, Samsung has integrated some tutorials and tips into TouchWiz to help you get familiar with the interface.\n\nS-pen:  Okay, let's be honest.  You should (and most probably do)buy this device for the S-pen alone.  This thing is awesome and is miles ahead of any other stylus out there.  Samsung has done a fantastic job.  The handwriting to text works flawlessly (even with my mediocre handwriting).  S-note is pretty great, but the pen works with most other note-taking apps I have tried as well (OneNote, Evernote, etc).  There are lots of magical things you can do with this pen as well, just search for things like \"S-pen smart hover\", or \"S-pen shortcuts\".\n\nScreen:  The screen packs a ppi of 189 at 1280x800.  For an 8-inch tablet this is great.  I have tried 10 inch and 7 inch tabs, and I think I have found the sweet spot at 8 inches.  It's the perfect size for portability while not sacrificing real-estate.  When this is held up to the Nexus 7 it's a pretty noticeable difference in screen size.  I can hold this in portrait mode with one hand easily, and landscape with two without my arms getting tired.  For those debating between 10, 7, and 8 inch screens.....go with the 8.  I've owned all sizes and can say this is my favorite so far.\n\nSpeakers:  Nobody buys a tablet for the amazing speakers that they have.  That's just not what they are for.  I can't complain about the speakers on the Note 8 though, they get the job done.  My wife was watching a trailer on my tablet in another part of the house and I could hear it crystal clear.  Good enough speakers for what they are meant to do.\n\nForm factor:  I bought the black, 16gb version.  The black on brown looks super sexy and feels great in my hand.  I honestly love the feel of the tablet.  Some people say \"oh it's plastic and not as sleek as the iPad metal\".  Well, plastic doesn't scratch as easy and is lighter.  Plus, you can take the back off of the tablet and access whatever you need.  Most people will be using a case anyway, so let's face it....who cares about what the back is made out of.\n\nBattery:  Wow.  Battery life is amazing on this thing.  I went 2 days on the first charge (at 75%).  Everyone knows that the first couple of days you buy something new you use it more than you normally will....well that's the case with me and I still got a good 48 hours out of a 75% charge.  I left the tab at 50% the first night, woke up 8 hours later and it's at 48%.  I can live with that.  Of course if you are doing heavy 3-D gaming it will eat the battery a little more, but for normal productivity and social tasks, this battery is a trooper.\n\nCamera:  You are using your tablet for it's camera capabilities? That's weird....don't do that.  It's nice to have a front facing camera for skype and the likes, but who really cares about the rear facing camera and it's capabilities.\n\nStorage:  Having an external SD card slot is nice....but having it accessible without having to take off the case is even nicer.  Am I right?!  I have a 64gb SD card in this thing, bringing my total storage capacity to 80gb.\n\nOS:  Android is miles ahead of iOS right now...just look at the market share.  If you are debating between investing in the iOS or Android ecosystem....trust me (a former heavy iOS user)and go with Android.  If you are sick of seeing release after release after release and nothing changing in iOS then switch to Android.\n\nMisc. perks:  I can use this as a remote control for my TV....that is awesome.  When you purchase this and register with Samsung you get $25 to the Google Play store (as of 8/12/2013).  You also get 50gb to Dropbox free for 2 years, $50 to the Samsung movie store thing, and 3 free months of Hulu Plus.  When you put that into account, the price doesn't seem so bad.\n\nThat being said, the price is the ONLY thing I don't absolutely love about this tablet.  I got it for $379.00 on sale through Amazon, so it's definitely on the higher end of the <10 inch tablets.  However, it's definitely (IMHO) the best of the best in it's market.\n\nAndroid + Samsung Note 8 = win.  Go ahead and enjoy this tablet, I sure am."}

She wanted it to help take notes in class and the other apps (she has an ipad) but likes android better.  She can also chat with this and use it as a remote for the TV.  I thought it was a little expensive but she likes it and uses it all the time."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I purchased one of the brown/black tablets shortly after the release of the new Nexus 7 after looking for a tablet that would be useful for taking notes during meetings at work as well as providing me with a fun, functional tablet.\n\nOperating system:\nThe stock operating system of the Note 8.0 is android, and while it is very snappy, it is slightly behind compared to the new Nexus 7 which came with 4.3. The Note 8.0 has some trick functionality built into the Samsung Touchwiz interface, where it automatically loads a list of S-note templates when the s pen is removed from its silo housed on the bottom right of the tablet. Personally, I have used Touchwiz before on my Galaxy S3, but I didn't like the feel. I have upgraded to a different launcher that allows for more customization to all screens. Android is highly adaptable and highly customizable, which is one of my number one reasons for choosing this tablet vs an ipad mini or the new Nexus 7.\n\nFeel:\nThe body of the tablet is made of the same plastic and glass as the rest of the Samsung Galaxy flagship line. On a tablet of this size, it doesn't feel bad. The corners are nicely sculpted, the screen is slick and smooth. The S pen is tucked neatly away inside the lower right corner of the tablet, and comes out with a satisfying click when removed. It is nearly a bit too large to handle with one hand, but is large enough that typing is easy, even for someone with large fingers.\n\nScreen:\nThe resolution of the screen is 1280x800 and at 189ppi it is quite a bit higher than the current generation ipad mini (163ppi), but significantly lower than the newest Nexus 7 (323ppi). There are some applications that look a bit rough, but the majority of those applications are optimized for phones, rather than tablets. While the Nexus 7 kills this tablet on resolution alone, it doesn't have an s-pen or any of the s-pen specific apps avaiable, so these are really two different animals.\n\nSpeed:\nThe speed and memory of this tablet are right on par with the rest of the tablets available in the coming months. It is fast, handles multiple processes with ease. I have noticed no slow down issues when watching video and using other apps at the same time.\n\nBattery Life:\nI have been getting several days out of the battery at a shot (depends on my daily usage). However I have wifi set to sleep when the display is off unless it is plugged into an outlet and charging. Usually I am seeing between 6-7hrs of screen on time before getting to about 10% battery. I leave display brightness set to auto, and smart stay is on.\n\nS-pen:\nThe s-pen that is included with the device is much larger than those that come with the Note and Note 2 phones. It feels very good in your hand and is definitely usable by people with larger hands (me, being one of them). I still however have chosen to purchase a larger s-pen for comfort reasons when trying to sketch or take notes quickly.\n\nI am very happy with the Galaxy Note 8.0 overall. I would have rated it higher if there were more tablet optimized android apps available, a slightly higher screen resolution, and if the price were lower. At this time, the Note 8.0 is really the only android tablet of this size to offer the s-pen, and samsung knows that, so they charge for it. The experience of using the s-pen is in an entirely different world than using a capacitive stylus on any other device."}

Its perfect in so many ways.\nI'm a Full-Time musician & Part-Time PC Tech, and the GN8 is helpful in both of these aspects.\nThe S Note app allows me to create folders to help organize where everything is. The Android OS allows me to have access to my Evernote & Google Drive accounts, which comes in VERY handy.\n\nThe Musician:\nWhen working on new songs I now simply open up an \"idea note\" on the GN8, write down the chords, lyric ideas & take a little video of me playing the song & embed it into the same note. So a few days later when I want to revisit the song, I just need to open on that one note to help me continue from where I left.\n\nThe PC Tech:\nI take lots of notes, especially when it comes to new problems, or obscure issues.  So writing or typing down my notes of the problem & the solution, provides me a quick way to resolve the issue if or when it happens in the future.\n\nDue to my double life, I have different email addresses, the built in Email program is BRILLIANT, It supports multiple emails from different carries, so I have both my gMail accounts & my GoDaddy accounts at a tap of finger.\nIt gives you the option of viewing all the emails at once, or you can pick and choose which email you want to see.\nAnd the \"Delete All\" feature is a GodSend. When I want to clear out my inbox. I don't have to choose every single email anymore, I just to options and say \"Delete All\". Its brilliant.\n\nThe S Pen is the REAL selling feature, it allows me to take notes, draw diagrams, or just doodle when I'm watching TV. Also I've downloaded the \"KoBo\" app, which turns the GN8 into an awesome eReader! the size is perfect for reading books.\n\nThe 3 major difference I've noticed between the GN8 & the GN10 are three things:\n#1- The Size\n#2- The S Pen is smaller than that of the GN10\n#3- GN8 doesn't have an LED flash for the back camera.\n\nHonestly, those were not a deal breaker for me, the camera quality is OK, but you have to keep in mind that the device is not intended to BE a camera, it is much MUCH more than that. Its like a dream catcher for creativity.\nI had the GN10, it was a great device, but it was too big for my liking.\n\nIf your looking for something with a great camera, then this is not for you.\nIf your an active person, who has bursts of creativity & would like to capture it at a moments notice, then THIS is the device for you.\n\nI hope that helps :)\nMuch Love."}

The scheduler integrates with weather report!  I love the smart-eye technology which works most of the time for me.  Too many good things to say, and I am officially impressed.\n\nHowever, the back camera stick itself out of the back a little me, making it easy to scratch. Anyway, a portfolio/ cover happens to solve this issue as well.\n\nIt took me sometime (but acceptable) to figure out and test the data and app backup processes.  To me, this is extremely important. If I am going to put all my life data into this little device, I have to make sure the data can be restored."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "Galaxy Note 8.0 review.\nVery good tablet but falls short in some critical ways.\nI like the size and I find it the most functional tablet next to my Galaxy Note 10.1 except for some critical flaws that made me decide to return it.\n1. Bad baattery. Don't know if I got a defective unit, but the battery life is unacceptable for my use (there was likely something wrong with the unit, but if there's something I can't stand in a mobile device, it's poor battery life)\n2. 16GB of internal storage just doesn't cut it for me. Without installing a single game or storing a single picture or music or movie, I was beginning to run out of space just after installing \"most\" of my apps, that I actually use, and yes I have an SD card (but everyone not living under a rock knows that since ICS Android no longer supports A2SD), and heck no, I have no intention of hacking and switching my external SD for internal SD (been there, done that and all the resulting problems are not what I have the time to deal with)\nThe above issues were the biggest problems with it.\nOther things I would change are:\n1 Higher resolution screen with excellent sunlight legibility\n2 Make it even lighter\n3 Better robust speakers\n4 Add flash to the camera and equip it with better cameras\nI think if you get a unit without a bad battery, this would be really functional, assuming you'll not be installing a lot of apps on it. I don't think you'll find any tablet right now that offers the utility in terms of taking notes and just being productive (besides the Note 10.1 if you don't mind the size).\nIt's sad I'll be returning it. Maybe if the battery was good I'd have kept it and lived with the restrictive memory.\nFor now I'll stay away from every tablet or phone with anything less than 32GB of internal storage. BTW, when your internal storage drops to about 2.5gb your phone or tablet will begin to lag. This is the cause of lag in a lot of devices. Keep you internal storage at about 3.5gb and you'll likely see no lag."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I commute to university on public transit and I used to take my heavy laptop to school every day because I thought it was the best method for typing notes and accessing eTextbooks. I started looking at tablets because I was tired of lugging around that heavy computer all the time. I was looking in the 7 inch range for one-handed use but I decided that there was no way an on screen keyboard could keep up with taking lecture notes.\n\nSomeone on reddit's Android subreddit introduced me to the Note 8 and I was immediately hooked on the idea of handwritten notes on a tablet. After trying it out in a local electronics store (where they were asking $399) I knew that this was the tablet to replace my laptop. The S-Pen doesn't track instantaneously, but it's fast enough to feel natural when writing and drawing. My only gripe with S-Pen is that the button on the stylus is a bit hard to press, but that's the nitpickiest nitpick there is.\n\nI'm not totally in love with TouchWiz, Samsung's \"skin\" that they place over Android to include their own looks and features. My phone runs mostly stock Android and has done so for years so I suppose it's merely a matter of preference so I don't dock it any points. It's not bad, just not the flavor of Android I like best. Fortunately the S-Pen works fine with third party ROMs.\n\nThe screen is sharp despite the relatively low ppi (pixels per inch, 189ppi) and is great for reading. The colors are too brightly contrasted or harsh and the tablet has a massive brightness range from very bright to VERY dim--perfect for when the professor turns off the lights and turns on the projector.\n\nThe hardware specs are great and it runs any game with ease. I've considered getting a sacrificial TPU case and a Gameklip for big screen mobile gaming with a controller. 1080p movies and videos playback fine though I wouldn't keep 1080p content on the device, total storage hog, plus the tablet is only 720p despite being able to output 1080p to a TV.\n\nI purchased an STM folio case to go along with it, something WITHOUT MAGNETS. I've heard the complaints about magnets damaging the S-Pen functionality and while I don't know if they're definitive, I certainly wouldn't like to find out on my tablet.\n\nOverall this is one of the best products I've ever dropped $340 on. Makes you wonder why a smartphone with less capabilities (except the ability to make phone calls, which incidentally the international Note 8 allows it too) can cost up to twice as much with half the useability. This tablet is someone finally figuring out a mobile device for content creation, not just content consumption."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "The Samsung galaxy note 8 is the best tablet I've ever owned! The note is fast, sleek, small, and powerful. The plastic back looks very sharp and holds up fine. Any worries that this tablet will easily break is just completely wrong.\n\nApps- The note is powerful enough to play any app no problem. They run fast and never lag! I have had iron man 3, fast and furious 6, and Netflix all running at the same time and nothing shut down. On my iPad 3 this would have led to an app crash at the very least.\n\nMovies- While I don't usually watch movies on my tablets, the note has no problem playing them. I have Netflix, Hulu, and videos from Google Play on my Note. The note while not quite HD, is still a high quality resolution picture. Images are sharp and crisp on the note with appropriate shading. The ipad does have a slightly higher resolution screen (if that really is all that matters to you in a tablet then get an ipad). The sound quality is okay. The speakers are on the bottom back which I really didn't like, but are easily loud enough to hear without worry.\n\nSPen- Is very handy, great for taking notes or memos. It is easier than typing and much faster. the screen is sensitive and easily picks up the pen strokes taking down messages letter for letter without mistake.\n\nBrowsing the web- incredibly easy to get information and do whatever on the web. Wifi speeds are fast, and has a very strong signal. Easily keeping 4 bars from long ranges (unlike my iPad 3).\n\nI love this tablet and easily recommend it over the ipad. While the ipad has a sharper image, it lacks power and runs much more sloppy than the note 8.0. The size, power, and price are perfect on the Note 8.0. The screen  is the perfect size for a tablet. And I highly recommend you get this tablet!"}

The Note 8 will not \"see\" some wireless networks. After some trial and errors I manage to solve this issue by changing my wifi router settings (you can read about the problem and the solution here: [...] ).\n\nThe S-Pen is a nice feature, but since I use evernote which does not support S-Pen there is not much use for it (for me), unless you use Samsung's S-Note. This is not really a con for the Note 8 but more a con for evernote.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this product"}

I'm using the Moko Ultra Slim Lightweight case  for protection but it has the power and volume buttons fully exposed. Other cases may solve my problem, but I haven't looked into it yet. The GN8.0 is also very expensive but it has the features that I want in a tablet. While I was willing to pay extra, I still wish that its price is lower.\n\nI wanted it for its size, good screen resolution, IR controller, and the S-pen. Like many of the reviewers here, I own multiple devices. I  have  the iPad, HP Touchpad, iPhone and the Samsung S3 but lately, I  tend to use the GN8.0 more frequently. The S-pen, with the Google keyboard, is very convenient for taking notes. I also like it when I can  easily switch to sketching with a precise pen.\n\nThe remote control feature is also nice to have. I can control the home theater in the family room, the master bedroom TV and the TV in my sister's house.  It works with the Panasonic, Samsung and Sony TVs that I have tried to control.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "Bringing back the stylus of old resitive touchscreen technology has come with ridicule, but critics could not be more wrong. Combining technology of old with todays technological advancements offers a new valuable feature set that sets this tablet apart from the mainstream. With so many tablets offering virtually the same real world performace and feature set, when one comes out with a unique feature set it makes the decision of which to purchase much easier. As long as you know what that feature set has to offer you.\n\nPROS:\nThe processor and memory allows you to breeze through menus and execute any operation to include any app currently available on the market without a hiccup. The screen is bright and clear with no notable differences side by side with my daughter's iPad Mini. Battery life is on par of all the others easily getting through a heavy days work without charge. However, these are not the features that should draw you toward this tablet as many have these same bragging rights at a smaller price. The precise control of the Wacom's 'S' pen technology is its defining feature. You can truly use this to replace pen and paper when taking notes during a lecture or meeting. Try the same thing with your finger or fat tipped touch capacitive stylus and you will quickly be back to a pen and paper after your notes end up looking worst than a 5 year old writing with a crayon. Refining pictures on photoshop is quicker than on a computer with a mouse and again offers the precision unmatched by any other (non-penabled) tablets. The same thing obviously holds true for artists or doodlers when using applications like Sketchbook plus adding the utility of pressure sensitivity for accurate shading without having to contstantly adjust through the menu. In addition to the 'S' pen, the IR sensor is more useful than I had imagined. I easily added all my TVs,  Bluray players, projector, receivers organized by room even my 15 year old Aiwa system. Granted the app could be a little better by adding easier access to more controls for each device but does well enough to bypass buying a $100+ Logitech remote.\n\nCONS:\nSamsung fanatics ardently back the use of plastic to encase their premium devices, but the look and feel simply does not match the quality exuded by Apple products or Asus's infinity tablets. Although I would love for Samsung to take note and offer a premium casing to match the rest of the device, adding a quality case easily remedies this minor complaint.\n\nOVERALL:\nAnyone who wants to use a tablet for everything from an powerful productivity tool at work or school to taking full advantage of art and photo apps should look no further than this or possibly a Note 10.1. Personally, I have found the 8.0 tablet as easily useful as 10 inchers with better form factor to use on the go, but those who plan on using it for more for graphical design might want the extra real estate at the cost of resolution. If you have no interest in jotting notes, utilizing photo or art apps then save money and get a Nexus 7 or one of the other countless counterparts with similar features, otherwise look no further as the price of Note 8.0 is easily justified"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "So to start off, I do think that the $399 price tag is a bit much, which is why I'm giving it four stars, but besides that, this tablet is pretty darn great. I'm a painter/illustrator and while I wouldn't use this for anything official (unless it's my last resort), this does make for a great on-the-go digital sketchbook. The S-Pen is accurate enough that drawing on it is almost as accurate as writing with a physical pen and paper. There's still a tiny TINY bit of lag if you're used to Wacom tablets but it's probably not noticeable to most people, and out of all the Android tablets I've tried this has been THE most accurate. It won't replace a Wacom Cintiq but as I mentioned, is great for sketching, best coupled with Autodesk apps. The S-Note app is great but it's pretty limited as an actual drawing or painting program.\n\nOther features that can be useful for artists would be the Multi-Window feature. I haven't used it much as of now but I can see it becoming very useful when researching and note taking. Another one would be the aNote HD app. I wish they renamed it because it sounds like an amateur app but it's a great organizer. So if you're the type that has a lot of ideas, thoughts, notes and events that you need to document, this app would make things easier for you. It's pretty detailed as well, so you can make sure that all your entries are neatly organized and properly labeled in a fashionable manner. The S-Note has the same, though more S-Pen dependent features, and as far as I can remember, both the aNote and S-Note can work together, so that's handy.\n\nAs far as drawbacks, I know it sounds odd but the system sounds are very limited. For example, the system sounds for pressing buttons, locking and unlocking are all water-drop themed. I'm not sure why Samsung had to pick such a specific sound instead of a sound that has mass appeal. You can't even change it to something else, you either have it on or off, which is a bummer if you want a more professional sounding tablet, but I digress. The screen does get smudged easier than say, a Nexus 7 but I guess that can be countered by buying a screen protector or having a handy tablet-friendly cloth wipe.\n\nAnother drawback is that even though the system is marketed as 16gb, I only have 9gb of available memory. I've used less than a gig of memory so far and it's disappointing that the system is close to being full - by today's typical memory consumption standards. I know that companies always market devices at a certain amount only to find that a few gigs have been removed when you get the device, but 9gb from 16gb is a bit absurd. So just a warning, you should buy an SD card if you need more than that. You technically do get a 50gb Dropbox account - though it has yet to appear on my account, might have to activate it? - and have the ability to access your Google Drive, assuming you have one, which technically gives you around an extra 65gb if you're connected to the internet, but if you want memory on the go, I suggest just buying a memory card if you can.\n\nOverall I do love this device. I wish it was cheaper, but whatever. If you're an artist and looking for a good tablet to draw on, you can't really beat the Note 8.0. As far as I know, Wacom themselves provide the pressure sensitive technology so you're in good hands. I might trade it in or sell it when the REAL Wacom tablet comes out, but who knows when that will be. In the mean time, this will do the job.\n\nPS, If you're debating between the 10.1 and the 8.0 and size isn't an issue, I recommend the 8.0 because the 10.1's screen isn't as responsive compared to the 8.0. The only thing that can beat the 8.0 in the near future would be the upcoming Samsung ATIV tablets which also sports the S-Pen, but those are more closer to being computers than tablets. So basically if you like the 8\" size and would need the S-Pen functionality, it's worth the money."}

I am glad I did not get the Galaxy Note tablet.\n\nI showed him Acer Iconia W3 and only cons i told him was Screen which is decent and viewing angle which is decent also told him is not really a big issue using Acer Iconia W3. I told him using acer has more better specs than your note. Acer has 65GB, HDMI, MicroSD and built in Office 2013 Home which works great. The price is not bad at all which is about $10 difference compare to the NOte $399 price tag. He loved seeing my Acer Iconia W3. His best part what he wish he had was having a full blown computer like acer iconia w3. And he was surprised that I can Uninstall my Apps or Programs anytime and NO Restriction like the Note or Androids have. Oh well i guess he stuck in a tablet reader only with Bloatware."}

While I have a Kindle Paperwhite and love it, the NOTE 8 has expanded my ability to enjoy all that is available on the internet. It is light, a good large screen but not too large: therefore making it too heavy.\n\nAs an older guy with poor hearing, I actually can hear this NOTE while wearing my hearing aids.  Many devices I can not hear at all even if I am wearing the hearing aids.\n\nI fell in love with this device within minutes of turning it on.  I sent back the new Samsung 8 inch TAB without even opening it. Ok, I did buy both of them on the same day and received them on the same day.  I was planning on returning one of them.  No contest for me; the NOTE takes the cake.  Now, got to go read a bit...."}

I'm moving on to a four year college and carrying my laptop to class wouldn't be ideal for me because it's so heavy. I just wanted something that I could throw in my bag, good at note taking, watch movies, play games, Surf web etc. I was leaning toward the ipad mini. However, the multitasking screens sold my mom and I as well as the capability of how precise note taking on this bad boy is. My penmanship isn't great so the fact that it can detect what I'm writing is amazing. AS I'm writing this whole review With horrible penmanship right now with very little errors, it's SO Smooth. I would have given it 5 stars but I must say the camera isn't amazing but I knew I wasn't going to use the camera much so the picture quality doesn't really bother me. All in all if you're a student and need a good note taking tablet for lectures rather than annoying keyboards, this is a tablet for you. Overall, I'm extremely happy I received this rather that an ipad mini."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "So basically this tablet got a lot of reviews, and I'm sure all of you have read everything about its magnificent features specially the S Pen, so i'm sure i'm not gonna add much so I'll keep it as short as possible. It is a great product and me being a big android fan, I can confidently say it can't get any better ... oh well almost !!! The only negative thing I can say about it, is its inability to deal well with large pdf files. I think this is a  problem for android in general, and this is one of the areas where apple is still superior. Opening and skimming through large pdf books on apple devices, for example an ipad mini ,is much more fluid and you don't have to wait for pages to load even when the processor is actually weaker on paper than samsung's processor. I frequently use this tablet for reading and for the most part it does the job but recently I got a large book (around 220 MB) and the device had major problems with it. I tried several ebook  readers to open it and I noticed variable performances between them but none was perfect. The best reader which gave me a very fluid performance comparable to the one I saw when I opened the pdf on an ipad mini was the kindle application, I was happy but again the kindle doesnt have all the options provided by my favourite readers.\nAs a summary, I highly recommend this tablet, it is superior to apple in most aspects except for the one I just mentioned, so I think the manufacturers should work on that."}

I never want to write into anything on the web or for the Calendar. I am probably one of the last people that likes to \"write\" things down. So this note tablet is INCREDIBLE! It does everything that I want it to do. I am even writing this review on it which is taking about 25% of the time it would take me to pound it out with my fingertips! The write to text technology is amazing. I am using it for shopping lists, to do lists and to write better responses to emails when I don't have access to a computer. Average battery life ranges from 1-2 days with good usage. The other great thing is that you can fit it easily into a purse unlike the full size iPad. I know there are all the reviews out there about it being a \"phablet\" but I would never want to use the note 8 as a phone. I am glad it only has wi-fi so that I am not wanting to use it all the time which is not healthy. Recommended for those that like to write, the S-Pen is fabulous!!!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I have had the Galaxy Note 8.0 for a week now and decided to share my thoughts. I come from a heavy iOS/OSX background owning Ipad3,ipad Mini and Macbook air. This is my first Android tablet . I also own a Sony Xperia Ray android phone but use it mainly as phone. I also bought Xperia Tablet Z recently and had to return due to build issues after few weeks .. I won't get into specs or detailed reviews ( there are quite a few good ones out there) but will list out why i chose Galaxy Note 8.0\n\nBuild : Everyone is complaining about the plastic build of Galaxy note 8. It is actually very solid and has no squeaks. The backplate gives a little when you push it. However most will use a case to put their tablets so this is a non issue. the white plastic looks classy. Also as this is plastic the Wifi and bluetooth connections are solid. I get min 4 bars even in bedroom with router in living room. Compared this to ipad mini barely went upto 2 bars. Sony Xperia Tablet z was terrible ..It dropped connections so often it was unusable . However not a big fan of where power button and vol buttons are . I would have preferred  power button on top and vol button on left so when i hold tablet they don't get pressed accidentally as this tablet is designed to be held in portrait mode. Also love the physical home button ( I think this because of habit i guess all Apple devices have them :) ). This tablet also weighs as much the ipad mini and Xperia tablet Z so it is very lightweight and easy to hold in one hand for long hrs.\n\nDisplay : Even though the display is 1280x800 the display is very crisp. Movies and pictures look really great and text looks real good at decent reading distance. The display is way better than Ipad Mini but little bit lower than Xperia tablet Z which is 1080P. However i prefer the Galaxy note 8.0 display as it is easy on eyes. The colors popped so much on Xperia tablet Z it hurt my eyes. Small text ( try msn.com website) looks bit bad when you look closely . But you would never use tablet close to eyes anyways.\n\nBattery life : I get about 2-3 days on single charge with moderate use browsing internet, watching YouTube, some games etc. Mind you I keep brightness to 25% , Bluetooth and GPS off , app notifications off. This decent but not as good as iPad mini.\n\nSDXC card extension : This was the biggest sell for me. I bought a Sandisk 64 GB class 10 SD card and put about 40 movies on it and my books and i am all set for long trips. None of the ipads have the feature.\n\nNon Propriety port: The charge port is micro USB. So with my universal USB charger i just need to carry one cable that will allow me to charge my MP3 player, my tablet, my cell phone and my portable amp as all use micro usb port. Reduced the clutter of cables i need to carry when i travel\n\nForm factor : I was a big fan of Ipad mini for its form factor. I tried to use 10.1 inch tablet ( Sony Xperia Tablet Z) even though light became cumbersome after holding in hand for more than 30 mins. The 7 inch is too small , 10.1 inch too big , 8 inches just perfect for both reading books and watching movies. However i do prefer the 4:3 format of Ipad  mini Vs 16:9 format of Android tablets.\n\nMulti tasking : This is brilliant feature and this device allows to have two applications next to each other . This is good when you want to take notes and when browsing a website or a doc . Also the performance is so good there is zero lag even with 6 applications open in background. Ipad doesn't have true multi tasking and there was lag on Sony Xperia tablet Z even though it is high powered device. However that may be due to Sony's bad skinning of jelly bean\n\nPerformance/Touch Wiz : Samsung has heavily skinned jelly bean with touch wiz. However there is no lag as this tablet has gobs of power . The 2 GB RAM and quad core processor keep this humming along. I had sometimes 6 applications running in background which were cpu heavy but no lag or abrupt app closures. With Ipad mini apps sometime closed abruptly due to aggressive memory management. iOS is one of the best tuned OS and uses the HW properly . Android still needs horse power to run smoothly.\n\nSpeakers : They are placed in the same way it is on ipad mini. I like that because when i watch movies in landscape mode the sound is more rounded as my palms cup them. The are loud but not quite as loud as Ipad mini but way better than the ones on sony Xperia Tablet Z. The sound is loud enough to hear in a noisy env. I will not use the tablet for music as i have a very good Sony mp3 player with amp .. So the speakers are only for you tube videos or movies . Mostly i will use headphones anyways\n\nIR blaster : IMO this is just a gimmick. The Watch on and Peel work for me only if i point my tablet at  proper angle to the device it is controlling. The app has so little features. The one implemented on Sony Xperia Tablet Z is awesome. It recognized all my HT components complex menu options and controlled them without me having to point the tablet accurately at the device . However i am hoping someone will come up with an awesome remote app\n\nS Pen : This feature is new to me so i am completely fascinated by the tech. It recognizes my handwriting well and i am using it regularly for my meetings ( Handwriting to text mode) . Need to play lot more with it but love the ability to do this . Not many tablets have this\n\nPrice : I think it is reasonably priced ( I bought mine for $379) for features and functions it provides. people don't seem to mind exorbitant prices apple charges for their devices because they are cool :) . Spen , SDXC extension, touchwiz all makes this tablet worth every penny\n\nEcosystem and OS : Android OS is not as polished as iOS even in its current Jelly bean format . However it is more fluid than ICS. As to apps there are quite a few now in play store that are designed for tablets. Luckily for me all the apps i use i found them in play store . Also android is more open . So it allows me to manage my files the way i want and also root the device if i choose to. It is open to other ecosystems like Amazon market place so i am not tied down to a single ecosystem. This is huge benefit as i was tired of Apple restricting everything to iTunes\n\nCameras: I will use them only for skype so no issue with the ones on the tablet. Will never use the back camera for taking pics so it doesn't matter to me what quality pics it takes. however what ever pics i took for testing were decent\n\nThings i didn't like : The backbutton and multitask button are so sensitive that when watching movies i have accidentally swiped them and it went back to home page. there is no easy way to disable this . Also not a fan of the location of power button or vol rocker. However the samsung galaxy book cover case is alleviating this a bit ..\n\nOverall it is a very solid tablet filled with ton of features and at reasonable price(IMO) on a very flexible and open ecosystem . You just can't beat that. Also it is way better than iPad mini (IMO).."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I've never owned any smart phone or tablet of any kind. I bought this to break free of my laptop, which IMO is only comfortable to use in a table/desktop situation.\n\nMy aim was mainly to be able to surf anywhere in my home. I bought the 8.0 Note after reading all the reviews about what a handy size it is(not too big, and not too small), and went for the Note specifically because the S-pen sounded useful.\n\nAll I can say is, I love this freakin' thing! Where has it been all my life?\n\nThis is what the internet experience was meant to be... something akin to having the comfort and flexibility of reading a magazine.\n\nThe Note downloads web pages extremely fast... in fact all functions are lightning quick, which just makes it a joy to use.\n\nI use it as a reader, the screen size and light weight are real pluses here... I use it as a day planner, the S-pen is surprisingly accurate and relatively natural feeling to use once you get alittle bit of a hang of it... there is still a lot of S-pen functionality left for me to learn, but it's so cool to be able to take notes and schedule a calendar without digging through notebooks, and paperwork.\n\nI just figured out how to use the Peel app to run my TV... it's just basic functionality(volume/channels), but what makes it pretty awesome for me is that it's also a fully functional TV guide. I'm only viewing over-the-air television, so unless I buy some form of TV guide I'm left to surf through the channels to figure out what's on. Now the Note just tells me what's on, I tap the program I want and I'm there... pretty sweet not having to search the room for the remote either.\n\nCons...\n\nI guess it is a bit expensive as far as Android tabs go, but it packs a lot of functionality that I guess no other tab this size does.\n\nMine is a bit creaky, but as long as it keeps functioning like a rock star It doesn't bother me.\n\nI can't really compare the screen to some of the super-duper ones out there as I have no experience with them, but playing games, watching video, and using as a reader.. I can't say that I'm disappointed. Doesn't blow me away, but I don't feel short changed either, IMO it looks great.\n\nAs far as battery life is concerned, I get 2 days normal usage out of a charge. In my experience the screen brightness is what really sucks the juice out of it. If you can live in the bottom quarter-ish of the brightness scale you'll do well. Also turn off things like Bluetooth, auto-sync, GPS, wi-fi when you can, and enable power-saver mode. Battery charges in around 2 hours for me.\n\nI dig this thing so much, I bought a refurbished Note 10:). I'm really liking the Flipbook app, and I'm thinking the 10 inch screen will be more satisfying with online magazines and videos... so the 10 can stay at home and the 8 can go on the road with me.\n\nGreat product."}

This tablet is the perfect size for note taking. The stylus is great and durable. (I would prefer a thicker one, but that's just nitpicking)\n\nThe tablet is very light and will not cause muscle fatigue (unlike the iPad) or hand cramps when holding.\n\nThere was no lag when running multiple apps. Placing it in powersave mode, gave me about 7 hrs of use, taking it out of powersaving mode, will use the battery more quickly.\n\nI will say for the artists out there, you may want the bigger 10.1 inch due to a bigger screen."}

I've found the \"note taking\" feature quite useful at work. Not just for meetings but collecting information from customers & PCs (employed in the IT field).

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I love the Galaxy Note 8 because it has all the features of Note 10.1 except the size.  It's so handy,  it can easily fit into the smaller lady's bag. The size of the screen did not affect the quality of my view of the other apps like the S Note because the size of the notepad does not really exceed 8\".\n\nThere were some revisions with the apps from the Note 8 that weren't in Note 10.1 like the calculator which I can access from the home screen or the quick menu when in S Note mode (meaning when the S Pen is removed from its slot). I don't know how to include the Calculator in the quick tray.  In Note 10.1, the calculator was accessible from the quick menu (tabs from the bottom when you use the ^ button).\n\nAlso the screen capture is done via a hand motion which I'm still trying to perfect because once my hand movement touches the screen there is a tendency for my screen to change, hence the screen that I am trying to capture is no longer the same.  But I guess this will just need just a little practice.\n\nThe apps on board the Note 8 (and the 10.1) are quite useful especially the Polaris Office and the Group Play.  Both useful in meetings and in viewing business notes and no need to transfer to my laptop as I can easily edit directly on the Note.\n\nReally love my Note 8.  Overall, this tablet is perfect for my needs."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "First off, I've had the tablet for about 2 weeks now.  I'm coming from an Ipad 2, Asus Prime (with dock), and the Nexus 7.  I prefer Android and the entire Google experience much more than the Apple IOS.\n\nThe PROS:\n\nSamsung brings a lot of features to the table that really work very well.  When the S Pen is unleashed the tablet can open up a world of shortcuts and applications that make wonderful use of the tool.\n\nThe tablet has a good feed to it.  It doesn't scream out quality like the Asus Prime or Ipad, but doesn't feel cheap.\n\nThe screen is great, not the best, but no complaints here.  Text is easy to read and crisp enough so that your eyes aren't strained over time.\n\nThe Samsung Universal apps are actually useful on this tablet.  Not all of them, but i good deal of them are very helpful and functional.\n\nSD card storage.  A must in my book\n\nProcessor, with 4 cores, is great for multitasking.\n\nBattery life is great.  I have NO idea what people are complaining about when it comes to battery life.  I take notes, surf, play a game or two, and check email.  I can get at least 2 days out of this tablet. I'd guess a good 5-6 hours of video time.  It should make it through that long flight.\n\nAirView.  It works very well and it's very helpful, in most cases.\n\nSNOTE.  They really did do a wonderful job with this app. My only complain is that landscape mode is too pixely\n\nThe CONS:\n\nEven though this is a 1.6 ghz quad core, it can run a little slow when selecting apps and toggles.  I blame Touch Wiz for this, mostly.  If you fully disable the \"bloatware\" the device becomes a bit faster.  Maybe it's just me?\n\nJust comes in white, for now.\n\nThe Bloatware.  Some of this stuff is just completely unnecessary to put on a device.  \"Samsung Cares\".  A video demo of the device (for retail).  Samsung, are you kidding me????\n\nReading Mode.  Very cheap trick, doesn't even dim the screen.  Download an app to give yourself more appropriate lighting when in the dark.\n\nNo ability to change your notification bar toggles.  I LOVE how they made this possible on the S4\n\nSettings are hard to find and plentiful.  It will take you a week to find all the little tweaks and features of this beast.  Once you find them all, you'll appreciate the product more and more. Still, the layout isn't the easiest to follow.\n\nI hope this brought new info to the table.  It's a great tab, but I have yet to buy a electronic item that is \"perfect\".  Too me, the Asus Prime came the closest.  BUT...if you need a note taking machine that is a bit more portable than the glitchy 10.1 edition....go for this one.  You won't be disappointed.  If you aren't stuck on Pure Android this is the best smaller tablet on the market.  I sold my Nexus 7 after this purchase."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "(Although I had owned two, a kindle fire and a galaxy tab 2 10.,  before.)\nI really discovered how much one can do on a tablet with the fire, which replaced my 14\" dell laptop as my constant companion. But the fire only whetted my appetite for a 'real' android tablet--I.e., one not so buried in the kindle ui, so I bought a galaxy tab 2 10.1. It was very convenient and fast, but not so handy as the fire had been. In fact, I liked the fire so much that I've given three of them as gifts. Meanwhile, I kept being tempted by the note 2, thinking it would be a better all-around device than my tab. I love being able to draw and make notes as well as surf and watch and write. When the ipad mini came out,  I considered it, but it just didn't feel quite right in my hand, and I had become a devoted fan of the android os by then. So, I was hoping Samsung would make a note 7.0, doing all the things I wanted but costing less than the note 2. After all, there's wifi nearly everywhere now.\nWhen I heard the next note would be an 8.0\" device, I almost went ahead and bought the 10.1 version, thinking the 8.0\" size would be nearly as big a hand full, so why not have more real estate to doodle on,especially Iin the duel screen mode.\nBut, the introduction day for the note 8.0 found me at Bestbuy, holding the note 8.0, which is enough different in proportions from the ipad mini to make all the difference. The greater pixel density more than makes up for the 2\" smaller screen than the 10.1. And, it's noticeably faster,  at least than the tab 2.\nAfter 2 months of daily use,  I am as pleased as I have ever been with any purchase. The battery lasts all day, and it's just a very pleasant little device to carry around. It's hardly heavier than my kindle touch, which seldom leaves the house now . It's surprising easy to see the screen in most light conditions. The keyboard is an easy size to use with one or two hands, and it has the best hand-writing recognition I've yet found, alhough sometimes it decides my capital letters are numerals.\nThe major drawback is that I wish Samsung had immediately introduced it with more memory.\nWould I recommend it to a friend?  Not necessarily. If you just want to surf the net and watch movies or play games or listen to music, then there are several 7.0 tablets out there at much lower prices. I've been giving the tab 2 7.0's as gifts now that the price is so low, but the nexus is also excellent.\nBut if you want a tablet for creating stuff, the note 8.0 seems the best choice available now."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I am a medical student. I got this to make my life as mobile as possible and cut down on the insane amount of paper that I use.\n\nFrankly, there are no capacitive stylus that can equal Wacom digital stylus technology. I agree that the price is way steeper than the Nexus 7, but remember that the Nexus 7 is subsidized by Google. Compared to the Ipad mini, which sells for about $70 less, this tablet is way worth the money. Never mind the specs being better on this than the Ipad mini. I am talking about the cost of getting a Wacom digital pen and tablet for the price of $70.\n\nWith this I am able to use Epic effortlessly. I can take notes as I talk to patients, take handwritten notes when I am in class, sync it to every cloud service you can think of, record lectures as I take the notes and play it back, convert handwritten notes to typed notes (need to have good handwriting) etc etc.\n\nReally, the S pen has sooo many uses. The ability to take a screenshot and edit it on the fly is something I use nearly everyday. This tablet may not completely please artists but for everyone else, there is no equal.\n\nAs for build and design, I have no problems with Samsung's plastic build. Nearly everyone throws on a case for their tablets (or phones) now a days. You DON'T even feel the plastic back that everyone whines about. Glass back breaks. Aluminum or polycarbonate backs glaringly highlights every scratch or defect. All adds to the weight. Plastic backs hides scratches and as I said, when you put a case on, you never even touch the plastic back again.\n\nBattery life lasts me the whole day. On average I get about 15 hours with about 3-4 hours of on screen time before I get down to about 20%. Probably could be better battery life, but since it lasts me the whole day without needing to find a charger, I am ok with it.\n\nStill runs 4.1.2 Jelly Bean. I hope they upgrade it soon, but no rumors as to when.\n\nConclusion: Buy this tablet if you have any interest in replacing paper in your daily life."}

The S-Pen shines! I have Intuous 2 Wacom tablet for my computer (yes, it's super old but still works like the day I got it) and I was skeptical that a tablet pen would give me the pin point accuracy I wanted for drawing on the go - but I was quite impressed.\nI'm mostly using this tablet for drawing comics and sketches, utilizing the Sketchbook Pro app. I've tried other tablets with styluses and this one just blows them all out of the water! The pen reads how hard or soft you are pressing and responds by drawing a thin or thick tapering line. FYI artists - the sketchbook pro app has a great palm-rejection feature that will only accept pen input on the canvas, so you don't have to worry about stray lines showing up on your work.\nAs others have pointed out, this tablet is also fantastic for note taking. The handwriting to text function is very accurate - it tends to get hung up on capital/lowercase letters here and there for me, but I suspect this is less the program's fault and more my own handwriting style. Love this tablet!"}

I willingly handed off my iPad to my wife as soon as I got this. I study a lot, usually in epub or pdf format, and the Note 8 is great for studying. If you are a student, this is a must have. The S-pen functionality adds a dimension to the tablet market that, once used, is hard to do without. I find myself using this far more that I ever used my iPad. It's lighter weight and smaller dimensions make it easier to take with. My hands would get tired after long reading sessions with my iPad but the Note is so light that's never been a problem. The display is STUNNING and the quad core processor is very snappy! Sure the iPad mini is cheaper but the iPad mini is a cheaper product in more ways than just price.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I would consider myself a techy and have owned many devices; ipad (3rd gen), ipod touch, nexus s, galaxy nexus, galaxy tab 8.9, nexus 7, galaxy note 2 and now my galaxy note 8.\n\nSIZE FACTOR (I wear a large sized glove)\nI think the Note 8 has finally found the size sweet spot. The Note 8 is comfortable to hold in the portrait and landscape position. I found the galaxy 8.9 and especially the iPad to be awkward and cumbersome to hold. In the landscape position I found it difficult to cover the entire space of the iPad and tab 8.9. I did like the size of the nexus 7 but chose to sell mine on Glyde to upgrade to the note 8. The Note 8 feels very comfortable to hold despite it being plastic. I do not have a problem with plastic phones or tablets because I always put a screen cover and case on my devices to protect them.\n\nSOFTWARE\nI was not a fan of Samsung's earlier renditions of its Touchwiz interface on my galaxy tab (8.9). In fact, I still think that stock android is ideal but I just install the nova launcher app (see link below) and run that on top of Touchwiz which is the main reason to go with an android device, customization! I had toiled with the idea of purchasing the Note 8 because I thought it was overpriced. So after a trip to BB, I tried to force myself to get an iPad mini but still felt like I was using the same operating system I had on my iPod touch from 4 years ago. Apple might get better apps at first but they all migrate to Android eventually and Android has so many customization apps available it is hard to get bored. Apples control issues will be its undoing imo, and have severely limited what these devices are capable of doing. Does Samsung copy Apple? I think they do copy some aspects of Apple like the messaging app and touch keyboards looks eerily similar and the presence of a home button. I think Apple makes superior looking devices but Samsung and Android have superior software.\n\nDISPLAY\nThis is another reason I chose the Note 8 instead of the iPad mini which I also think is the perfect size. I strongly considered waiting for a retina display to come out for the iPad mini but could not justify moving backwards to an iOS device. Also after I put a iPad retnia display next to the iPad mini I did not notice enough of a difference to justify the added bulk and expense that comes with the retina display. The display on the Note 8 is absolutely gorgeous! It is one of the most vibrant screens I have ever seen.\n\nMISC\nThe s pen is an added bonus but the addition of an micro sd card slot that is not hidden inside the device is another reason not to overlook the Note 8. Both of these options make photo editing easier in my opinion. I have a micro sd card adapter in my camera and all I have to do is pop it in the Note 8 and photos are loaded into the gallery. The s pen is cool but I have not had enough time with the device to review its effectiveness. The multiscreen ability of the Note 8 is one of its better features. It has a limited amount of apps that function with the multi screen ability but all of the main ones like chrome browser, facebook, maps and all of the samsung apps function.  I purchased the device at BB and made sure they price matched the Amazon price.\nCONCLUSION\nI can honestly say that I am completely happy with my purchase and despite the high price of the Note 8 I feel that I did not want to compromise with my tablet.  The Galaxy Note 8 is by far the best tablet/phone I have owned so far.\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher.prime&hl=en"}

Unless streaming Prime movies on the Fire HD 7\", the Note 8 had become my \"go to\" tablet, while my poor iPad sat ignored.  I did ultimately buy a Kindle Paperwhite 2nd Gen for reading, because tablet batteries run down too fast if one is a heavy reader.  My Galaxy Note 8 is still working perfectly, it's still quite a nice tablet, and it's still the best (perhaps only) option if you desire pen functionality.\n\nDespite my abysmal Samsung customer service experiences, I actually broke down and replaced my iPhone 4 with a Galaxy Note 3, and it is amazing. As in BEST.  PHONE.  EVER. So these days I rarely use ANY of my tablets.  I use my Note 3 for pretty much everything except reading eBooks (love my Kindle Paperwhite), and of course my PC is for more intensive tasks.\n\nThe pen functionality in the Note 3 is superior to the Note 8.  Assuming second generation Note 8 models incorporate that improved pen functionality/integration and offer a higher screen resolution, they could very well be the 7-8\" tablet to beat.  I personally recommend waiting for the next-gen Note 8 if you're in the market for a penabled 8\" tablet. If you also need a new phone, get a Note 3 and see if you even feel the need for a tablet at all.  That said, Amazon tablets are wonderful (especially if you are a Prime subscriber) and I frequently recommend them (Fire HD or HDX depending upon budget) to friends and family.  I also still feel that if one doesn't care too much about the pen, Amazon tablets are a much better buy.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nIf you really want the \"penabled\" experience in an 8\" form factor, this is the only way to go - if you can get over the risk and hassle of having to deal with Samsung's incompetent customer service, their frequently buggy (and poorly maintained) web site, and the premium price charged for a content consumption device with disappointing screen quality (only 189 ppi).\n\nThat said, features aside from the pen that recommend this product include:\n\n- The extra screen real estate of an 8\" screen over a 7\" screen\n- The ability to use Samsung's \"split screen\" Multi-view mode (only works for certain apps)\n- The bundled apps; some of the S-Pen apps are quite nice (I confess I rarely use them), while others are simply bloatware that permanently eat your storage space unless you root the device.\n- $25 Google Play credit - IF you can get them to fulfill it.  It took me months, multiple attempts to register, and finally contacting them four times via various methods.  No FaceBook to publicly call them to task, no love.\n- 50 GB Free Drop Box (limited duration of two years)\n- Micro-SD slot - although bear in mind that you won't be able to actually install most applications there unless you root your tablet (I have not).  Still, nice for music/movies/photos/eBooks.\n\nIf you don't feel the pen or dual-app/split screen functionality are \"must haves,\" then honestly, save money and consider the Kindle Fire HD 7\".  It has a better screen (216 ppi), better speakers, better battery life AND it costs WAY less (plus, free eBook loans with Prime!). Amazon has always treated me well, so I have nothing but praise for their customer service.  If the Kindle Fire HD 7\" isn't pretty enough or you don't like the Amazon App store (and don't want to root), consider the iPad Mini.  Still compromising on the screen (it's even slightly worse than the Note 8 at 163 ppi - shame on Apple!), but it's also somewhat less expensive, has a beautiful, svelte aluminum body - and Apple *also* has amazing customer service.  I can't speak to the customer service, but the (sorry Amazon) Nook HD is also a nice 7\" tablet, actually has the best screen in the 7\" form factor (243 ppi), Google Play Store access (no rooting required, although it's possible if you desire), includes a micro-SD card slot, and is going for fire sale pricing.  On the minus side, the Nook HD has a proprietary charge port - but you can stock up on spare charge cables with all the money you save.\n\nIf you plan to read a lot of eBooks and don't also have or want an e-ink reader, consider going for the Kindle Fire HD - or better yet the higher PPI Nook HD (you can always download the Kindle app) - your eyes will thank you for it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "From the beginning of my tablet search I was dead set on purchasing an iPad mini.  I have an iphone, an ipod classic, ipod touch and an ipod shuffle and have had good experiences with Apple products and didn't see any reason not to get an Apple tablet.  I didn't like the regular iPad due to size and weight so the mini was in my sights.  However, the one thing that held me back was the screen resolution of the iPad mini and the fact that Apple would likely release an improved mini 2 with better resolution and better processor.  I'm not saying that the current mini screen and processor is bad but knowing that it could be a lot better kept me from purchasing it.  So I decided to wait for the mini 2...and so I waited...and waited and then something interesting happened.  I decided to poke my foot outside of the Apple universe and see what other tablets were on the market and I came across some articles about the Samsung Note 8 and what intrigued me was the S pen.  This is my first tablet purchase and I wanted something that I could use for work in addition to home and the S pen seemed like a great feature.  I've always wanted to reduce all the paper clutter around my desk and having all my notes electronic was very appealing.  When I tried the Note 8 out at a local Best Buy, I was sold.  A lot of the key features and highlights have already been described in previous reviews so no need to repeat them here.  My primary use for the tablet is for note taking, productivity tasks, reading ebooks, and surfing the net (checking emails, news, stocks).  Occasionally, I would use it to play some games and watch movies to kill time if I was traveling.  After a couple of weeks of usage I can say that I am happy with my purchase with a drawback that, in my opinion, keeps this from being a 5 star tablet.\n\nThe drawback is trying to get movies onto the Note 8 without having to shell out additional $$ to purchase the movie in the Google Play store.  I have numerous blu ray discs that come with a digital copy of the movie.  Therefore, I can't justify shelling out another $15 to buy the android version of the movie.  I have found in a lot of cases the blu ray digital copy can be accessed either through Ultraviolet streaming which can be done via a Flixster app or a copy can be downloaded to a phone or tablet IF you have iTunes.  Right off the bat, I know that I will not be able to copy a digital movie from iTunes to an Android tablet.  So there doesn't seem to be a way to get those digital movies onto the Note 8.  On the other hand it's a cinch to move them onto an Apple phone or tablet with iTunes.  So my next option was to see if I can stream the movie via Ultraviolet/Flixster, which is not my first choice because its a wi-fi only tablet.  The problem is Flixster will not allow you to stream Ultraviolet movies if you have a rooted device.  Which is all well and good if you don't root your device but if you don't root your device then you can't have Flash Player running when you browse the web.  In my opinion, Flash makes the web experience better and that's why my device is rooted.  To go through the process of unrooting, and then streaming and then re-rooting seems like an inconvenience. I have Amazon Prime so I tried to stream movies from Prime but to my dismay I could not find the Amazon Instant Video app in the Google Play store.  They have it for the iTunes App store but not for Android.  What???  At the end of the day, this drawback was enough to prevent me from giving this product a perfect score of 5 stars primarily because it seems like an iPad would have less roadblocks to overcome when compared to the Note 8 in order to copy or play movies.  Again, this is not to say that the Note 8 is a bad product, the S pen is terrific, the size is perfect, the speed is top notch...its just my experience thus far with trying to use it for movies has been less than great."}

Amazon comes thru again. Now, with this price, even more of a reason to pick up this tablet.\n***end update***\n\nI have had his item for 2 days now, after orginally trying one on launch, then returning it. I was hoping to see a small price drop after the initial release, but when that didn't happen, I wanted to grab this before the Play credit of $25 went away.\n\nSo, as I state, this is truly a perfect carry around size for me. I've had no issue with the back button as some people have stated, and the feel of the pen is so close to actual writing that I have almost gone to it all the time for my email and note taking. I put on a Minuguard clear screen protector and find that it gives just the slightest drag on the pen to make it feel like writing on paper.\n\nI had been going back and forth between this item and either the Kindle Fire HD or the Nexus. If you want to use the pen, have a rear camera, and card storage, then this item is a no-brainer. If you want something to consume media, then the Kindle Fire HD has the best screen I have ever seen in this size package. The Nexus was the least expensive, was easy to carry also, but I was hooked on the S-pen of the Note and needed a camera for my work.\n\nWith all that said, the only thing holding me back was the $399 price. But, with the 2 years of 50gig Dropbox, and the $25 Play credit, you can drop that $399 down to $300. Also, this tablet comes with the charger. The Kindle would require another $20 for that part of it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I am a college student and wanted a supplement for my laptop. I wanted the everyday functionality my laptop offered me, but without the weight and process of setting it up. This tablet offers all the features that a productive student needs.\n\nThe integrated spen and snote are simple yet elegant, making it easy to write notes on the fly with accuracy. Being a math major, I especially love the handwriting to text application for it can pick up mathematical characters and put it all into text. I am not just talking about multiplication and division. The spen was able to differentiate a partial differentiation symbol from the number 2 which look very similar. The spen is well polished and a joy to use.\n\nThe screen resolution is not the highest on the market, but it still produces a very crisp and sharp image that is very pleasant to the eye.\n\nBeing a former apple user, I learned that the Android operating system can be overwhelming, but after a couple days you get used to it. Overall the operating system is a lot more efficient than ios and a lot more fun. Also if you feel like the display is just too much, Samsung added the easy mode for the home screen which is a great starting point for those not as familiar with Android.\n\nSamsung has loaded this tablet with apps. Some will be used everyday while others may be left to the side and forgotten. The app store is well stocked with apps as well but definitely not to the degree as the apple store.\n\nUnderneath the hood is a 1.6 GHz quad core processor with 2 gb RAM. What this means is that this table is great for multitasking. Internet runs seamlessly and loading videos is not an issue with this tablet. Unfortunately it only has 16 gb of storage with a decent portion of it already filled by the OS and pre-installed apps. It makes up for this by having a micro SD slot which can hold all your pictures, music, and videos. Also, Samsung has a partnership with Drop box which gives 50 gb of storage for 2 years.\n\nCameras are decent but nothing special. I was disappointed that there was no flash on the back camera.\n\nThe price is on the high side. It being $70 more than the Ipad mini can be a massive deterrent to many people. But when you take into account the amount of money you would need to spend to get an adequate note taking app and stylus for the ipad mini, the price difference definitely gets smaller.\n\nOverall a great tablet for those who want to be more productive. If you are looking for a tablet for just looking on facebook and playing games, then I would recommend looking at the IPad instead, but if you want a tablet that can supplement your work but still be a lot of fun, spend a few more dollars and buy the Note 8"}

I was leaning toward the Fire HD when Samsung announced that Note 8 was available.  I immediately did a side by side comparison of the features.  The Kindle screen is just a tad larger, but the Note's thickness  and weight is about half that of the Kindle HD.  Also the notes add on memory was a deal clincher.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I went into this tablet with the highest of hopes. I really wanted an Android tablet that could truly replace my trusty iPad.\n\nWhen I opened the box, the first thing I noticed was this beautiful white plastic and glass staring back at me. Looks nice. I picked it up, and it felt good in the hands, so i plugged it in and let it charge before turning it on.\n\nOnce I turned it on, things became messy. I noticed an inconsistent user interface even upon startup. Some screens were obviously Samsung designed, while others were obviously designed by Google. The Samsung screens asked me to sign up for a Samsung account. I figured I better do that, I'll probably need it later. After sign up, it then prompts me oddly as to whether I want to backup and/or restore from my Samsung account. Being a brand new account, there would be nothing to restore, so I selected \"backup\". It then warned me everything on the server missing from my device would be erased if I continued. How disjointed.\n\nI was approaching the end of setup, and it now asks if I want \"easy mode\". Wait, what's easy mode? There was a oddly worded explanation that I really didn't get, so I went ahead with easy mode. I knew this would be different than my experience with the Nexus 7, since that device is a \"true Google\" device and I had heard there were some differences.\n\nAs it came up to the desktop, I was impressed with the screen quality. I feel like it was definitely a little better than the iPad mini's, but maybe a little over saturated on the colors. I tried out a few of the in-device apps and felt underwhelmed so far. I bought this with a primary desire to write notes using the stylus; I found the stylus not much better than my Bamboo stylus for the iPad, although it was easier to write with. However, my hand kept hitting the back and even with the stylus in my hand, it kept bring up this menu. I found a trick online to turn the device upside down and use it that way, and that definitely made things better.\n\nI wanted to use Sketchbook Pro, so I purchased and downloaded that from the Google Play store. It worked well, but nothing tremendous. The pressure sensitivity seemed off; it was either light or dark, and there didn't seem to be a lot of pressure levels in between. Having used Bamboo and Intuos tablets before, I expected better from a Wacom digitizer.\n\nI tried out the handwriting recognition in place of the keyboard; I found that to be extremely unreliable. If I have to stop after every word to make sure it recognized it correctly, then it is useless. I will admit, my hand writing is rather atrocious, but not completely illegible. It would present words that weren't even close to what I wrote sometimes. Other times it put extra periods in.\n\nIt was really cool that when I was at the home screen, it would present a notes screen when I took the stylus out if its holder. To me, that was awesome that it was designed to detect that.\n\nThe voice on their Siri/Google Now replacement, S-Voice, is atrocious. It sounds like someone was running Siri down a drain and threw on the disposal unit for good measure. I would have preferred it just default to Google Now instead... but I couldn't find anything in the settings to minimize the awful Samsung supplied layers.\n\nI would say my biggest concern when buying the device also turned out to be my most obvious as I held it. It had a good weight, nice and light, but not too light. However, every time I shifted my hand a little, I heard a squeak. I couldn't figure out what it was at first, so I went into settings to figure out what was making the noise. Turns out, it was the plastic rubbing against itself at the seams. Unfortunately, this plastic device was flexing and bending and squeaking like nobodies business. I am not adverse to plastic devices, as I own a Nokia Lumia 920, but this was horrendous. The back with slight pressure would push in slightly, and just holding the device or picking it up caused the squeaking of the plastic. I felt if this was a under-$300 device, this type of build quality would be acceptable... but to charge a $70 premium over the iPad mini and to have such poor build quality to me was unacceptable.\n\nI didn't like this device, but I am certain it is a good device for some. My ideal device is a true Android Jelly Bean interface, a solid construction with no squeaking seams, a good responsive active stylus, and a consistent interface. Right now, that just isn't this device, or any Android tablet on the market right now. I really wanted an excuse to leave the iPad behind, but this wasn't it. I look forward to the device that wins me over."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "Let me start with what bugs me, which isn't much with this tablet.\n\nThe placement of the home keys... This is just something I'm going to have to get used to. It's nice that Samsung created fixed home keys vs using the android screen home keys. Only there at the very bottom. Every time I'm holding in portrait mode my thumbs keep hitting the return and settings key. Trying to hold it avoiding those keys feels awkward. I don't have tiny hands so this is going to take some getting used to. Also, when it's in landscape mode I forget the home keys are fixed and have to get used to using them with my left hand or right (depending on what orientation I have it). For people who have never owned an tablet before they won't know the difference. For seasoned users, this will take some retraining.\n\nThe camera is fine in portrait mode, but landscape it a bit awkward as well.\n\nAside from those two issues, I'm totally in love with my Note 8. I'm just going to list the thing I love, since there are many detailed reviews already on this.\n\nSize: I've owned 10.1 and 7.0. This is a happy medium for me. I love my 7.0 but the extra inch is nice. Although I would have been happy with it at 7.0 as well. It fits in my purse well and doesn't weigh it down too much. My 10.1 inch always felt heavy in my bag.\n\nMulti-screen: Very cool feature. You can easily view multiple windows at the same time.\n\nStylus: Never used one before and this is really cool. It's like using a pen on your tablet. Real easy to use. Only draw back is the home key the tablet is too hard to use with stylus, so I have to press it with my finger. Not a big deal for me though.\n\nBuilt-in apps: This tablet is designed for readers, note takers, web browsing and so, so much more. Samsung's built-in apps are really great. I've only had the tablet for less than week so I haven't had time to play with everything. However I from what I've used it's great for journaling and note taking. One of the main reasons why I wanted this tablet so I wouldn't have to buy anymore paper journals and do all my journaling on my tablet. Of course other tablets can take notes as well. It's just different with they stylus and the apps Samsung has provided.\n\nMicro SD: 64GB, that's all I'm saying. I've added on and it reads perfect. Yes, this tablet comes with free 50GB of space with Drop Box, but that's only for year. And what do you do when you want to access a file (pics or music) when you're offline? The added 64GB leaves me so much space to add my pics and music I'm set. My only wish is that Samsung/Google allowed for apps to be stored on the card as well. As with older version of Android used to do.\n\nCamera: Front and rear are great. Only when in landscape mode the home keys kinda get in the way. Again just some retraining for people who are used to having the home keys in the screen.\n\nDisplay: Love it. Took this to the beach. I had to have the brighten on the highest, but I was able to see it perfect. The reading feature is great too. Much easier on the eyes.\n\nExtra home screen: Every time you plug in your headphones or pull out your stylus you get a customized home screen that you can adjust how ever you want. So for example the stylus home screen has apps for notes and the headphone screen has apps for music and videos. With each screen you're able to add additional apps or remove them.\n\nThere's so much more this tablet can do I can go on and on. The price is a bit too high. I can see it at even $50-$75 dollars less. However what the stylus does is worth it if you have a need for this."}

I decided to buy from Best Buy, & no Play Store credit was included as promotion from Amazon might suggest, but I still got the DropBox credit and around 5 dollar in store credit with new BB card).\n\nI Highly recommend the MoKo Slim Cover Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 inch GT - N5100 Android Tablet, Black (with lip Stand, Integrated Elastic Hand Strap, and Stylus Loop\n(Payed $5.99 and it's definitely a 5 star product!)\n\nHope I helped :)"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I have to say that I really really love this tablet for only one reason: S pen. It's smooth and accurate. However, I had to return/replace the first tablet because of minor light bleed issue; unfortunately the second one's light leak was even worse. I am quite disappointed because this is absolutely not what I was hoping for in return of a big price (which could have gotten me almost two nexus 7!)\n\nIf you ask me whether I will give up on Samsung galaxy note 8 for a nexus or ipad mini, I will probably say no because of the S pen option (And I have an Asus 10.1 tab already, it is great!). But for now, my plan is to wait at least another quarter for the price to come down, or for some other new S pen options to come out...And yes, I absolutely agree with others, that the lack of SIM card slot is disastrous!\n\nP.S. I am fascinated by the S voice function, it's hilarious!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "I really like the Note 8 because it's more compact than my Note 10.1, but I'm returning it due to the low quality of the front facing camera. I do a lot of recording from my tablet and I take a lot of pictures as well using my front facing camera. The Note 8 front facing camera is only 1.3mp, but the Note 10.1 comes with a 1.9mp front facing camera. At first I was going to return my 10.1 when I ordered this one, but I'm glad that I waited. All in all this a very nice tablet, but for $400 I really think the front facing camera should have been better. My little sister has a Galaxy 3 phone and her front facing camera is the same quality as the 10.1, so I know the quality of the Note 8 front facing camera could have been the same or even better. I wish I could keep both, but I'm a unemployed student, so I have to go with what works for me and that's the Note 10.1. Most people don't use it for the camera features, so i would definitely recommend it for all the other features that it offers."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "If what you need is a device for watching movies or TV shows on, carry around in your coat pocket, in a purse, or small backpack, this is not the device for you. If that's your intention behind buying a small tablet, then there are better options for the price- much better bang for your buck if you must. This includes the Nexus and the slightly more expensive than the nexus but cheaper than this device Apple Ipad Mini (sorry that was a mouthful). However, if you like to or need to take notes and work in a setting where you are constantly on the move, need information quickly, have to organize information well, and increase your overall productivity - then this is the ONLY device I would personally recommend.\n\nAs someone who is in the medical field, this device gives me the ability to take patient history notes in an organized and secure manner. While there are other great note taking programs out there, the game changer for me personally was the S-Note program with its hand/wrist discrimination feature and hand to text mode. My handwriting is absolutely terrible but it does a phenomenal job of text recognition.  You cannot do this on the iPad and other android devices. In the past, I even invested in a wrist discriminating sensor thing for the iPad and that was a HORRIBLE idea. Not only can and did damage my iPad screen, it also did terrible job writing where I was actually writing. The text was always distorted above the pen contact point.\n\nAdditionally,  with this device, I was able to make a pdf template on my computer, import it into the SNote software and now use it to take patient history in a consistently organized manner. I never miss those frequently missed questions (like smoking, and packs a day, etc.). Some people have asked me why the the 8 over the 10, and the answer for me is very simple: I can't carry around a ten inch tablet in my white coat, it's just too big. The note fits perfectly in the inside and outside white coat pockets for men's sizes (>36), it sticks out a tiny bit in the smaller sizes (<32). My one recommendation, however, is to get a cover because you don't want to scratch your screen against your equipment or vice versa.\n\nAs a student, I can use this to annotate lecture notes and Powerpoints very easily. While the software can't import Power-point files, it's very easy to convert them into a PDF, especially on Office 2007 and then send it to yourself or load it onto the Dropbox. I can then import the pdf into Snote and note away.\n\nAs far as storage goes, these files aren't very big but if you are planning on using more storage (movie's etc.), then invest in an expandable memory. It's one of the big advantages of this device over the Ipad mini.\n\nYes it has a hefty price tag but the features are un-paralleled for productivity. However, the way I see it: you pay 300 for the premium specifications on the device, like the graphic card and processor, and another 100 for the S-pen feature. For me, it's an investment worth making if you are using it for the right reasons.\n\nBattery Life: Great but depending on the frequency of use, might require charging.\nFeel: I have big hands so it fit's pretty easily. It feels like holding note pad. If you have small hands and want to use this in a manner similar to what I do, try it at Best Buy first because I can see this being a problem for people with smaller hands. By try it, I mean really try it, pick it up and write on it for a few minutes.\n\nNote taking tip: The only tip I can give so far is that if you are taking notes and are getting frustrated by your wrist hitting the buttons (menu + back), flip it 180 with the camera on the bottom and the buttons on top. Works like a charm for me.\n\nIf you have other questions, please feel free to ask. I will try to help in whatever way possible.\n\nUpdate:\nImporting tip: So this isn't the most intuitive of things for previous ipad/iphone users but to import files or even just bring up a menu while in a program, click on the button to the right of the \"home button\" (the one that lights up and looks like the top of a college ruled paper). I know this seems like a stupid tip but believe me - when I was first trying to figure out how to \"import\" things into S-note or find how to reach the table of contents in the Kindle App, I almost lost it.\n\nS-pen compatibility: First thing, if you buy a new stylus, make sure you undock the previous stylus before using the new one. The new stylus will not work if you leave the old one in. Secondly, http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S-Pen-Stylus-Holder/dp/B0076Z3GMG/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1367301937&sr=8-4&keywords=S-Pen+Samsung+Galaxy+Note, that stylus feels nice but the one that I bought is slightly off calibration and the text is a few mm off. If this isn't a big deal then go for it. However, if you are OCD, this can be really frustrating."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "Like some of you ( or most) , I bought this for the pen. I had previously owned the other Galaxy notes, the 5 and 10 inch ones, but didn't really warm to them. This one is better. How much better remains to be seen, but I suggest you try it for a week yourselves , if you are on the same bent.\nEventually they will get it right, if this one is the real deal for me, I will get back to you with a happy update, but frankly, I'm not very optimistic, as the category is still not mature, and and I'm getting a bit tired of failures. But like I said, this one seems better after a few days.\n\nBut really, for me It boils down to comfort. Pen and paper are VERY comfy. But they said that about soft and hard pulp books a few years ago. And of course, the ebook never caught on LOL\n\nUpdate #1  I'm actually using this. It fixes some of the issues I had with the other sizes (see above). The only thing that bugs me is the very slippery writing surface, but its doable.  The built in s-pen app is fine, but I just tried Papyrus and this app seems way cool.\nAnyway, I will keep updating."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "Let me start off by saying that I did not buy this tablet at Amazon. Having said that, after using it for about a week, it has proved to be an excellent tablet and comes with features that you don't find in the competition.\n\nMost people who have an issue with this tablet are concerned about the price. While that concern is legitimate, it is misguided due to the fact that it compares this tablet to the iPad mini. To start, the iPad Mini is exactly the iPad 2, except with a smaller display, which makes it two year old technology. It is powered by an anemic (by today's standards) dual-core 1 Ghz A5 CPU and a paltry 512 MB of RAM. By contrast, the Note 8.0 is powered by a quad-core 1.6 Ghz CPU and 2 GB of RAM. It is not the fastest CPU currently out there, but it is miles ahead of the A5. I am fairly on top of current technology, and I can't think of a single tablet in any form factor that has more powerful hardware. Absolutely not the iPad Mini or the iPad 4. And the obvious difference is that the Note 8 has a pen-capable display, which is not found on any competing 8\" tablet. Now, I am not trying to claim that either the iPad mini or the Note 8 are overpriced/underpriced because I simply don't know, but I am trying to point out why the higher price of the Note 8 is justified.\n\nThe other issues that people seem to have with this device is the plastic housing and the screen resolution. While it would certainly be nice to have full 1080p, I can say that the screen on this tablet is excellent. I would not consider the screen resolution to be a drawback in this device. To give you a comparison, the 13.3\" display in my MacBook Pro has the exact same resolution as the 8\" display in the Note 8. It is very sharp. As far as the plastic vs aluminum housing goes, let's put it this way; every iPad or iPhone I've seen in use was shrouded in a thick layer of plastic, rubber, or leather, and chances are good that you'll be buying a case for this tablet as well. The housing should make no difference to most people, and arguably plastic is more durable. You drop a metal tablet, you'll either dent it or bend it. It's permanent damage. You drop a plastic tablet and it may just absorb the impact better, w/o significant cosmetic defects.\n\nAs far as my experiences with it go, I have had absolutely no problems. The tablet is very fast and fluid, screen is plenty bright to even use in direct sunlight, and battery life is adequate. I can't give specific details on battery life yet, but from what I can tell so far, I should be able to get around 8 hours of screen time and maybe more. It of course depends on a lot of things. Browsing for example will use more battery than reading an ebook, likewise watching videos will use more battery. The biggest battery drain is the screen, so if you are using it at max brightness, expect significant battery drain. That goes for any tablet.\n\nSo, should you buy this tablet over the iPad mini or the Nexus 7. Well, they are both cheaper, and if you are already invested in the Apple ecosystem, it may make more sense for you to go for the iPad. The Nexus 7 is very cheap by comparison, and rightfully so. Despite being powered by a quad-core CPU, the Tegra 3 is not anywhere near the speed of the Exynos chip in this device. You can look at benchmarks online if you want, but I have another tablet with the Tegra 3, and the Exynos CPU in the Note 8 blows it away, benchmarking nearly twice as fast. And you can really tell the difference in regular use. Of course the Nexus 7 is also a 7\" tablet. The only way I'd recommend the Nexus 7 over the iPad mini or the Note 8 is if you're going strictly by price. Otherwise, you really have to decide whether or not you need the stylus. If all you want is to watch movies, read news, and play games, you have no use for the stylus. If you need note-taking capability or precision touch capability, this is the tablet to get. The Wacom stylus is not simply a finger replacement, it is a precision tool for handwriting, drawing, or designing, and it works extremely well."}

I have 5 bars of uninterrupted signal on my Samung and LG phones and Toshiba laptop.  The battery has dropped 20% while writing this review.

Its got that one size fits all factor, wether you like browsing or reading you can do it comfortably. Taking notes is just a breeze. Honestly the screen is gorgeous and its got 189ppi so between this and the nooks or ipads I'd still go.with the galaxy note because I can't differentiate between them. The note is better than the nook as it just works out of the box, you don't need to waste your time trying to put cyanogenmod, unlike the nook the galaxy has a great os, I thought I would hate touchwiz but honestly I actually like it. Sketchbook pro works amazing. I don't know what else to say, all of my humble bundle android games work. If I ever need the cameras maybe they'll come in useful but I'm glad I do have them. Battery life is something I need to come back and update but it looks ok for now. I seriously don't know how much more I can praise it, sure its 70 bucks more than the iPad and if you want the note features and the ability to draw and expand the memory id say get the note... I'm really happy with it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00BQH8UEY", "review": "...if you don't already have one.  Otherwise, it is an excellent upgrade to an older one.  From what I've used of the iPad mini, the Note 8.0 is a worthy competitor (IMHO).\n\nI won't bore you with a list of specs that you can find online with a simple search.  I'll give you what I liked and didn't like.  Everyone's experience will be different.  As always, I encourage you take a list of what you intend to use the tablet for then make a trip to your local store and test\nit out for yourself.\n\nThese are my initial impressions:\n\nWhat I really like about it...\n-Lightweight, yet sturdy in feel.\n-Bright, vivid colors.  Excellent resolution.\n-S Pen is excellent for drawing/handwritten notes\n-Size is perfect for holding with one hand.\n-GPS\n-Powerful processor and plenty of memory.  Haven't had issues in video playback with a dozen apps running.\n-mSDHC allowing the OPTION to carry around a multitude of files and apps\n-Responsive touch screen.\n-Includes Polaris Office\n-S Calendar seems to work better.\n-My Note 2 S pen works on this as well and vice-versa.\n-Samsung includes a Swype like keypad.\n\nWhat I didn't necessarily like...\n-Sound is so-so, as expected from a tablet this size and this thin.\n-Price.  Comparable to the iPad mini in spec and price...\n\nSUMMARY:  If you're looking for a well constructed tablet that provides Play store access, a stylus for that tactile experience, excellent video and extra features such as GPS and mSDHC AND have $400 to boot, then this is your tablet.  If you already have a tablet, whether Win, Andy or iOS and are perfectly happy with it, no need to buy this one.  It's still a great tablet and you won't be disappointed."}
