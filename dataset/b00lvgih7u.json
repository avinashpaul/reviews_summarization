(I didn't because I don't read instruction, and it took forever!)\n\nIt was a strange start to our relationship. Buttons for the home / return indicated on the manual do not exist on the product. I managed to lose the on screen controls and couldn't do anything with it. Rebooted then realized they are controlled by software and have not had an issue.\n\nThe A33 Cortex A7 is a newish processor at a low cost. I didn't benchmark it just did some testing in real world use.\n\nWifi reception isn't the greatest if your wifi is sketchy but works fine when you have a strong connection (I guess close to the router). The internal memory isn't great so you will have to do some workarounds when you are loading things on (an inherent android problem - not specific to this tablet)\n\nMinor stuff out of the way everything else is pretty good. Nice standard screen - touch response is good - and it zips around pretty well. It has a nice tactile case built into the area around the back of the unit which I like and in general its a good basic utility tablet. Mini SD if you want to expand memory but keep in mind android limitations.\n\nIt will only play basic games. Asphalt 8 and Batman crashed on start up or 20 secs into the game when graphics options were set to the lowest. Even Zenonia 4 which has been out for ages crashed after ten mins play unless you went and set the graphics to low. It more for Angry Birds etc and ones that don't rely to much on the power of the machine. The OSD can be weird too - When playing Madden it would take several attempts to press something onscreen before it worked, yet it you bought up the OSD it would work straight away. I narrowed this down to the OSD not adjusting correctly so make sure you launch the games / programs with the OSD off then everything should perform as expected although it misaligns the buttons when you re launch it isn't a big deal if it is displaying right when it is launched.\n\nDragon stuff is pretty good for what it is - been there seen it and this is a good budget option with more powerful feature filled options available if you want them in their other tablets. This one is a good utility tablet for the kids, as a backup music player, or for movies - does all of this OK just not good for games or intensive stuff. Can be a bit slow even with browsing with several things loaded but usually not to bad.\n\nI couldn't cover everything in the video but hopefully will give you an idea of the product in use. $75? OK with its limitations in mind.\n\nProduct received for review opinions formed by me."}

It must have had an internal clock, because 3 days after the warranty was up, it wouldn't even boot up. I took it to a repair shop and was told I'd be better off just getting a new unit. I really expected it to last more than a year, especially since I didn't use it everyday. Lesson learned... just pay a little more and get something that will give you your money's worth"}

Unfortunately it did quit working after a year or so but that is more because of the abuse our two year old rendered upon it. Countless drops, gunk from lollipops, bananas and whatever else our tender angels heart desired as she watched you tube, baby games, drawing, etc. I have not found a value equal to this tablet and I've looked pretty thorough. We settled on a couple of 7\" fires and RCA pro voyagers which are fine but we all really liked this tablet very much. When it passed calls were made, papers notified and plans for wakes made.

It just shows the Dragon Touch logo and will go no further, even using the Tiny little reset button on the back that you have to push with a paperclip.

It has performed flawlessly. I get about 4.5 hours on a full battery charge, get a power pack and plug it into the usb port and you can keep going as long as the power pack has any charge  in it. My only complaint is the sound is poor,  a few dead pixels in the display and there is NO BLUETOOTH. Dont use the camera so cant comment. Get a micro to full size USB adapter and put all your movies on usb. I don't use a screen saver and don't have any scratches, this glas is hard. The screen is 10 point multitouch and running CNET screen test it is very close to specs. Obviously I have not had any reason to contact Dragon Touch so cant comment on service.  extra note, I really like the VLC media player from google store (free) it has a lot more control while viewing videos."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "I really like shopping around in these under appreciated niche companies. I had never heard of Dragon Touch. I mean, everyone gets android, or ios, or amazon right? I was blown away by this guy. I'll get it's only con out of the way first: the screen resolution leaves something to be desired. It's good, but just a little pixely.\n\nBut I really don't care about screen resolution. I got this for reading books and scientific papers on and it's just perfect for that purpose. The wifi card in it is great. I mean, it's better than other wi fi devices / computers in my house.\n\nThe speed is great. This was something I was worried about, I mean, would it be responsive, and the answer is  a resounding yes. It's not laggy like I was expecting and it plays anything you'd expect to work on any other android devices.\n\nOne word of advice. At first, I thought the power cable didn't fit. It uses it's own custom power cable which is my only disappointment. You have to push the plug in just a little stronger than your used to. I didn't realize this until it's 5th charge or so, and previously I was annoyed that the plug wouldn't go in all the way, so it wouldn't deliver reliable power. I was wrong though, and you jsut have to push a little harder.\n\nI would go buy one of these over the alternatives that can easily cost more than 5x. If you want a tablet, this is definitely the one and you won't be disappointed."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "I bought this tablet knowing it wasn't expensive, would be clunky with the wi-fi and so forth like others have said.  I figured I could deal with that, and I was right.  There were a few aggravations but overall I'm not complaining my casual use of the web with it during travel.  But what I did NOT expect, and what was totally disappointed to find out, was how bad the sound card was!  The sound quality itself isn't bad I suppose, but the volume is extremely soft.  It has a volume limiter that posts a \"nag screen\" that you have to defeat, but even after that, when you set the volume as high as it will go, you will be able to hear it okay in a quiet place only.  When you get on say, an airplane, or in a noisy terminal for that matter, forget about it!  So with movies during flight I cannot hear the dialogue, and most music (except for some recordings that were evidently recorded louder) becomes unlistenable.  So that pretty much defeats most of the functionality I was interested in.  Oh, and the pictures that the camera takes are of quite poor definition.  In this day and age, you expect to have certain baseline functionality like adequate sound.  I consider that an underhanded move by the manufacturer to put in such a cruddy component.  Very disappointing."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "great in every way but one, durability.\n\ni used it lightly for a few months and now, when I really need it, it doesn't work. it failed this morning. I had it on, there was over 70% battery charge left, saw some dust on the screen, gave it a good wipe-down with a screen cloth, and after about 8 seconds of wiping it shut down. I was jiggling it a bit while wiping, but not more than is typical for the chore.\n\nI've worked in IT for years and know device abuse when I see it. It wasn't being abused, just normal wear and tear. I tried everything imaginable for about an hour and couldn't get the thing to power back on.\n\nI imagine it's just a loose power supply connection or something, and could be fixed if I popped it open and fiddled with it a bit, but then again maybe not.\n\nthe point is that no device should have experienced a catastrophic failure from having its screen wiped.\n\nthe build of the machine is fairly flimsy, but that didn't bother me. I liked the quirkyness of the plastic housing. but the workmanship turned out to be too shoddy for the device to be reliable. I'm posting this review as a caution. if you need a tablet that's durable, look elsewhere. if you just need one to post on a wall and use as a digital picture frame, this could work. just don't ever clean it vigorously."}

The camera quality is terrible (and yes, I removed the protective plastic film from the camera lense,) and I could find no way to activate the front facing camera.. if there really is one.  There's also a screen button for taking a screenshot.. why?  I must have taken a dozen screenshots unintentionally just handling the device. Then I read all the news about Chinese tablets being preloaded with malware. I'm just glad I tried it before giving it to my mother as a Christmas present.

Folks should realize that this tablet has only 512 RAM (half a GIG) rather than 1 or 2 GBs in other, MORE EXPENSIVE tablets.  However, if you are a casual user (check e-mail, browse Internet, play simple games that do not rely on speed, stream Netflix or other on demand video programming, check sports scores, read e-books, etc.), you should be good to go.  I had to return this particular model because of a video defect that showed up after a few days (green horizontal stripe at the bottom when watching certain video apps), but I have no reason to expect this to happen often.  I did not re-order the tablet simply because I decided to stick with my current \"phablet\" since this 9 inch tablet got a little heavy for me to hold while watching streaming video.  If the size of tablet is good for you, order the Fintie folio case that fits this Dragon Touch perfectly in your favorite color, and you will have snagged a sweet deal for yourself or a gift for someone (with LOTS of $ to spare!)."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "Well people, you get what you pay for. I had low expectations for this tablet. They weren't low enough. I wanted to use these for a development project and thought I could use two of these for testing units. I needed some Android devices to do some user simulations and I didn't intend to use these for anything more than some simple diagnostic and analytic data generators. Wrong! So wrong! Sigh... The four star average rating on this product has to be a sham. I've had some budget devices before, they get pretty bad sometimes, and this product is bottom rung. Dust visible under the screen, the screen itself makes an awful screeching sound when you swipe your finger over it. It's that rubber/plastic rubbing sound that reminds you of window squeegee screeches at the car wash except in a really negative way. Oh, the digitizer was crooked and off kilter on both of the units I ordered. It's probably a painful representation about the sad life of the malnourished sweatshop worker who assembled the tablet, sad and drooping just enough to make you cringe a little on the inside. My first world issues! Why can't I just be happy with a handheld computer that connects to the whole world via the internet??? Because of my OCD, and because I deal with dozens of high tech products everyday and see the best and worst of them. Lord, why? ... Ok, back to the Dragon Touch A93.9. The screen is just bad all around. The 4.4.2 Android version seemed up to date, I'll give them that, but the user aesthetic experience was painful from the start. I didn't even get to sound quality. Bad screen and bad benchmarks is as far as I could stand before caring about the rest of the issues I knew I would find. Perhaps I am pretentious about electronics, but for a few more dollars, you can get a name brand Tablet performing, looking, and feeling much better. Don't waste your time.

It booted easily and the display was crisp and beautiful. I set up the G-mail account and the wireless network. I've had the tablet a month now and can only find one gripe. On boot up There is this sound that I can't adjust down or turn off. I've looked for a way to disable it but couldn't find anything in settings. Overall This tablet is a best kept secret. Apple, google, Samsung, Microsoft, and most of the others charge over a hundred. This tablet works as well as most and well enough to be more than worth the bargain.

Later I learned from some of the reviews that TabletExpress \"bribed\" buyers by offering them a free cover in exchange for a 5 star rating. Not sure if this is true, but I certainly can't see how these tablets could be a 4.5 rating.  The wifi on these tablets is very poor, and internet connection cuts off regularly such that I have to restart download of updates and new apps (this wastes a tremendous amount of time).  One of the tablets had very low volume relative to the other.  I installed Minecraft PE on all 3 tablets for my kids and eventually Minecraft PE would not launch on any of the 3 tablets.  Similarly, many other apps freeze on the tablets and/or are unable to download necessary updates or content. Camera photos are also terrible.  Overall, the poor operation of this tablet makes it not a feasible option for a budget tablet.  TabletExpress support has been useless, plagued by boilerplate responses that do not help the issues.  Fortunately, Amazon.com Customer Support has, as usual, come to the rescue!  Amazon has allowed me to return my 3 tablets after the regular return policy period expired, in light of these defects!  I look forward to returning these defective tablets, getting my refund from Amazon, and investing a bit more money in tablets manufactured by a more established, reputable brand.  This cheap Dragon Touch tablet simply is not worth the headache and wasted time in downloading apps and trying to fix issues."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "I bought this tablet with the express purpose for watching my weekly shows and newer movies. Up to now it's been my cellphone and the S5 screen was just too small. I wasn't expecting a whole lot for the very reasonable pricing. I was very surprised at how well its serving it's purpose. At first I thought the touch screen seemed plastic looking with some haze and didn't like how easily I could put micro fine scratches made by my finger.  I was happy to find out the tablet came with a screen protector which is very convenient.\n\nAfter using the tablet daily for a month, here are my observations;\nThe sound is so low, I cannot have any background noise even with headphones on. Battery life is impressive lasting longer than my laptop. The movie resolution is often times so noticeable its annoying and find myself tipping the tablet to see better. What I thought was a factory included screen protector turns out to be the screen itself. I do need to remind myself that I payed less than $70 for the tablet and that puts it into perspective for me. I am considering a tablet with better resolution perhaps for a Christmas present to myself. Shop around and do some homework so you won't take a few steps backwards like I did."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "It's a really mediocre device.\n\nTHIS ONLY HAS 2 HOUR BATTERY LIFE!!!\n\nOther than that, it's a bit slow, the video/pic quality is pretty low compared to the HD devices available. Web browsing is fine. I literally only use this for e-reading and comic book reading so it is perfect for those purposes. I think I would hate it if I actually tried to watch videos or web browse. I keep it in airplane mode all the time to save battery. I think the price is fine for what you get but definitely pay more than $50 if you want to do things on it other than reading."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "I've never used a Dragon Touch tablet before, but have heard good things about them; and boy am I glad that I actually bought one for the low price of 55 dollars, free shipping and good quality.\nHere's my review-\n\nBuild quality/accessories-\n\nAs usual, these days, you buy a tablet, you usually get the standard USB dongle, a charger, a manual and the Tablet itself; which is pretty much what I got in buying this. Some tablets offer a case, but I'm not picky.\nAnyway, the build of this tablet is good. You'd be hard pressed to find a difference in build with this tablet when comparing it to most high end tablets out there. It has a little weight to it and feels sturdy, the capacitive screen is slick and has good quality. It comes in an all black color and buttons have the right amount of feel to them when you press them.\n\nScore- 9.2/10\n\nSpecs/Gaming/Apps-\n\nBeing that this is a Google play enabled tablet, there's no need to root it. In fact, if Google play isn't your thing, you can always install the amazon app or 1 mobile market app as well for different apps altogether. As far as specs and gaming goes, gaming has been flawless and super responsive. You'd think with DDR3 ram in the tablet that it would be slightly slower than most, but apps are responsive. Of course, if you don't have a good Wi-Fi connection in your home, then the speed will go accordingly, but overall, the specs are handled really well. It works with all the standard apps like Skype, Google Play, GPS, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Youtube, etc. Start up time's about 20 seconds if that. It boots fast.\n\nScore- 9.5/10\n\nScreen/camera-\nThe screen is great. Very responsive and no lag that I can actually remember whatsoever. The camera on the other hand is just okay. It doesn't have the best quality, which is understandable as it's price warrants something to be off. Screen is multi-touch, yes, there's pinch and zoom.\n\nScore- 8.5/10\n\nSound design, resolution, options-\n\nThe sound is good. It's nice and loud. Candy Crush sounds insanely loud for my taste and so do games like Wordament (which doesn't have music but sound effects). Screen resolution is crisp, there's a nice balance of contrast and richness in color detail.\nOptions include Wi-Fi, syncing google account, date and time, sound, alarm, notifications setup, language, display settings (smart color), about tablet, reset tablet, update, and many other adjustments. My only gripe is, tablets need to come with more exclusive apps (some came with Getjar, and even if Getjar sucks, it's still an exclusive app to some tablets, it would be nice to have a bonus sometimes, but I digress)\n\nOverall-\nFor 50 plus dollars, this is absolute steal. It's fast, good build quality, good sound, cool interface, even comes on with a signature jingle. Google play. Worth every penny. I highly recommend this tablet."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "The tablet over all was decent for someone who just wants to maybe check email on it or occasionally watch youtube videos. It wasn't for someone like me, who plays a lot of games as the system itself isn't able to play a lot of the newer, larger games and the sensitivity was slower than I was usef to.. I had an issue with a strip in the middle of the screen that would go out randomly, it seemed to run near the power input, so I'm not sure if they're related. It was nice for a cheap tablet and didn't feel flimsy. I don't regret my purchase. It gets the job done. I read from a few reviews that this tablet sometimes comes with similar problems that I had, so you do take a chance with buying this tablet."}

This tablet is slow, clunky, and so cheaply built as to be a joke.  It takes a long time to decide to open apps and when it does finally open an app it locks up as often as not.  I've had it for two days and the screen, which has a very odd feel compared to other tablets I've had/used, is already scratched simply from being swiped.  If Amazon would allow it, I would rate this tablet as negative 5 stars.  I will be returning this tablet and will never again buy one made by tablet express."}

Don't know why I kept it.  To remind me to do this,I guess.\n\nAnyway,I used it for a week or so,then one day,I took it out of it's case,and the screen was broken. Mind you,this thing was always kept in a padded case,never dropped or bumped,and never even left the house. I was not overjoyed.\n\nI never bothered to try to get a warranty on it. I figured they'd just say it had been abused,and offer to \"fix\" it for me,for about 2/3 of what I paid for it new,plus shipping both ways. No thanks. I could probably just buy a new one cheaper. But I won't buy a new one. It's easier just to walk to the  bathroom,and flush my $70.00 down the toilet.\n\nIt's too bad really,because,while it worked,it worked pretty well. I didn't have the wi-fi problems some others did. It had a decent screen resolution for e-reading,and watching Youtube vids,and movies,which is what I mostly used it for. It booted up fast,and had a quite responsive touch screen.it didn't freeze up,or spontaneously shut down,and it popped from website to website acceptably quickly. I cant address the issue of it being rooted from the factory,but anyone who thinks that any device you buy doesn't report back to Big Brother Inc. exactly what you're doing,is living with their head in the sand. Although,it's true that,presumably,a big company like Apple,or Samsung is a lot less likely to sell your personal info to Vladimir or Yuri.\n\nSorry,I digressed. After reading more of the reviews here,I am now convinced that I did not break the screen,that it was instead defective. Some people got them out of the box that way. So,I can't recommend this thing,at least,not until someone convinces me that they have fixed the screen problem. If that happens,I might even buy another one myself."}

It doesn't connect to WiFi correctly (my home, work or school) and when you finally get connected it shuts down and brings you back to the main screen.

Also, cover does not FIT exactly and have to keep pushing/pulling to adjust to use functions, cameras etc. Better supported for these uses without cover. After downloading programs, the response is super slow and 80% of the time the downloaded file says they are not responding. how does that work with NOT WIFI but only accessing downloaded files. Does that mean the Dragon is inferior, slow to respond?? Please inform as I would like to order additional tablets, but am confused by this response of Dragon Tablet. Thank you"}

I purchased this online through Amazon in December 2014,this tablet was working fine until may of this year. I was using it one day and it just shut off when I turned it back on there we're just lines going across the screen and no picture,I tried to reset it with same result just lines. That being said I looked up my warranty and found that it expired after 30 days on amazon,when I went to tablet express I called the number given for customer service which when called puts you into voice mail stating that someone will return the call within  24hrs,I have called several times with no response they also have an email address which I tried after several attempts I sent an email yesterday and finally got a response stating they were sorry no one called back and my warranty has expired but they would like a PIC of the lines and that they can try and repair it at my expense I'm sure. In the meantime I have purchased another tablet locally,as I stated earlier I understand that it's not there most expensive tablet but I would expect to get a year out of it not 5months,the point is between very poor customer service and a cheaply made product I would not recommend purchasing this tablet."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "Since I have become an Amazon customer, I think this would be my first negative review of any product. I don't give negative reviews for just for giving them, but this has been my experience with the product. The company as well as others may say different but my experience is just that, mines!\nPros:\nSo here goes. First of all my hats off to Amazon for providing great packaging, in a secure and safe delivery box. My products which includes a case for this tablet was delivered in record time and neatly packaged. When I unboxed the items, I definitely was impressed the tablet had a sort of leather back finish which was unique for a tablet, but I loved this sort of finish. All accessories were included with the tablet except for a headphones. This was minor since I always have lots of headphones which came with phones which I have bought previously so as I said this was minor.\nCons:\nHere Is where my disappointment came as a mighty rushing wind. The item was bought as a gift for my wife who didn't want a costly brand name tablet but just a normal tablet that can surf the net lightly, check out facebook and twitter and maybe some skype. The tablet was very fast with its quad core processor apps launched at lightning speeds. But just as I was about to surf the net.....(Bonk!!)\nThe tablet could not recognize my router. I have other android phones, brand name (Samsung, Alcatel, HTC) and Chinese phones as well (maxwest) which connect to my nexxt stealth 150 router seamlessly and  without issue.\nI tried rebooting my router which was working fine, nothing. I used the button at the back for secure connections, nothing. I rebooted the tablet, nothing. I tried downloading several other wifi connection apps, (via my pc) nothing. I even logged on to the tablet express website searching for help, any help that I can get, but the website was not very user friendly and did not provide any solutions whatsoever to this connection problem, they provided Only to download a whole lot of different roms which I have yet to try but this might void my warranty.\nI even checked out there Youtube channel which also proved futile. I did get however more help from other people who had similar issues. Most of which were equally frustrated and just returned the item.\nI tried with the best of my technical know how to try to get some sort of internet connectivity with this tablet and it was futile. My wife is disappointed, I am even more disappointed.\nAs I said all products bought from Amazon were of the highest standard thus far but this one was a lemon.\" A bricked tablet!\"\nDont know if anything can be done as I live in Trinidad in the West Indies, but this has been my experience with this product.\nD.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "The Dragon Touch tablet is a very good tablet for what it can do and for the price.  It is quite good for handling today's daily tasks and our multimedia consumption.  It handles with decent efficiency and is quite affordable.  My qualms with this device are: the fairly short battery life; WiFi is an energy hog, and it's very easy to forget it's still running; it sits on its speaker; you can't run the audio of YouTube like you can on a PC (just have it play in the background); lastly, it has a rather abysmal camera.  These issues are by no means a deal breaker, and some of its qualities can be improved upon with software updates.  I enjoy my tablet very much; it rivals my PC and other multimedia devices.  This is a worthy tablet in total."}

KitKat 4.4 is fast.\n\n*CONS*\n1. Charger gets extremely hot during charging, which I consider very unsafe and a fire hazard. Old fashion chargers should be banned in this day and age. A \"SAFE\" USB charger should be included for all tablets on the market, rather then a disaster waiting to happen.\n****Do NOT leave unattended or plugged in when not in use****\n\n2. Tablet has imbedded scuffs on screen. Almost look like finger prints but its not. I wonder if this is really a returned/refurbished tablet. I don't know, but that alone is reason enough to return it.\n\n3. When unlocking tablet it automatically goes to Camera or Google search. This is very, very annoying.\n\n4. Android theme music at startup is also very annoying and extremely loud. I've searched everywhere on tablet and can not find a way to turn it down or off. It's not an option, not even in \"sounds\" setting.\n\n5. Also in sounds, I unclick tablet sounds and they are still there anyways. Its very annoying when typing on keypad.\n\nAll that said, it's true you do get what you pay for. Charger heating up is my biggest concern with this tablet and reason for return.\nI would not recommend purchasing it, until the above \"CONS\" are fixed by manufacturer, especially the charger.\nHope this review helps you in your decision to buy or not :)"}

It plays games, Netflix and YouTube as fast as my iPad but its nowhere near quality. Its light and cheap feeling , almost hollow feeling. Speaker and camera are low grade. But its 65$ and does it all. I got leather flintie case and screen protectors for 16$ more u should too its worth it. Wish I got keyboard case tho"}

Looking at the specs, I expected this one to be far superior. However, it isn't quite what I hoped for. The screen resolution is disappointing. They advertise an HD screen but it looks like an entry level smartphone. Don't be fooled by the photos. It is grainy and not sharp at all. Also, the unit is frustratingly SLOW. Like, push a button and wait for 3 seconds for anything to happen, slow.\n\nLet's be fair, it is $65. If you want something super fancy, you're paying 5x the price. I do like that it has a micro usb and micro sd slot. Ultimately, it does what I need it to which is take notes and run basic office programs (for school and work). I am keeping it because it is a 2nd tablet for me just to throw in my backpack.\n\nVerdict: don't expect too much, the screen is weak sauce, but it is functional and CHEAP. Get what you pay for."}

The controls are positioned poorly for reading documents -- hard not to hit them when reading, and hard not to accidentally take screen shots when viewing videos or looking at pictures. Most annoying. Screen is not just plastic, but soft and easily scratched. Screen resolution is poor unless you are looking at a 90 degree angle. Colors are rendered poorly.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "We bought two tablets and we are sending them both back. The shipping was extremely fast, which is the only positive thing I can say for our experience thus far. After booting them up we immediately noticed how slow the download speed was. We called our Wi-Fi provider to see if the problem lied with them and that's when we were able to determine that when the Wi-Fi was turned on on the tablets it took our usually high speed connection down to 2Mbps or less. We tested multiple times and tweaked several different settings to try to stop it from draining our download speed, but it never failed, as soon as the Wi-Fi was connected our download speed would drop drastically and all devices would drop their ability to load Internet pages. I would not recommend these at all. I was disappointed in the feel/quality of them to start, but figured you get what you pay for, but these are really shoddy. I'm also disappointed in the overall rating of these tablets. I count on reviews to make my online purchases and I am feeling like we were mislead."}

A icon on the screen comes up when you press one of the volume buttons and you can adjust the volume that way so I don't care about that. The internet seems to work just fine as long as you don't have too many applications open. I had to shut some of them down so I could do a search on google maps while in satelite mode. Netflix seems to play fine. I watched about 15 min on one show to see if there was any buffering and there wasn't.\n\nThe main issues I have with this is how long it takes to charge and the screen quality. It took a long time to get it back up to 100% batter (5 hours) and you have to look at the screen direclty.

I tried to dislodge the shaving by shaking the screen slightly, but to no avail. My friend was not bothered by the shaving after I showed him, but he was clearly frustrated (rightfully so) by having to reset the tablet TWICE after attempting to watch movies on it within a day and a half of having it! The screen froze, and rebooting using the power button wasn't an option because it didn't work. The screen also doesn't appear to be nearly as strong as my Samsung tablet, because it cracked after a one foot drop to the floor, with the tablet cover closed (though I will attribute this to my friend being careless).

Since I didn't know that the screen protector was already attached, I pulled off the covering shield and screen protector in one fell swoop.\n\nI bought the Folio Keyboard Case with it and it also works very well - not suitable for heavy keying, but does the trick for light duty. I planned to use this mainly to download books, which works fine, but it's great for checking email, the web, ect. Faster than my one year old laptop."}

It does aright as a reading device. When playing games, the app shuts down all the time. I contacted the company several times, and followed all their suggestions. A couple of the techs were actually argumentative. They finally suggested replacing the unit. I mailed it back, and they did send me a new one. After about a week, it started doing the same thing as the old one. I hate to waste money, so I'll hang on to it for reading. My advice: pick another brand."}

At face value everything looks great with this device, until you connect it your wifi and look through the settings.\n\nThe wifi in this device is completely useless and makes the device completely useless.  I am a security analyst and used to be a network engineer so I naturally started troubleshooting the issue.  I found that the wireless is disconnecting and reconnecting about every 1.5 seconds causing horrible lag and most apps to not work at all.  I even tweaked my home wifi settings to help and it slowed the reconnects to 1.7 seconds.  I finally gave up and started looking through other settings on the device.  I have two other Android device at home and have never had issues with wifi.\n\nIt says 8GB, but it is really only 5GB.  Between the \"Internal Storage\" and \"Internal SD Card\"  There is just over 5GB, which means that you only get about 3.5GB of usable space after the OS.\n\nIf those two aren't deal breakers then this will be.  The device is rooted.  You may be asking what does that mean.  It means that someone(likely the seller - TabletExpress) has loaded their own version of the Android OS on the device.  Doesn't sound to bad right? Wrong!  This allows them to put malware on the device that can collect information without you knowing!  Anything you type, load or access on the device can and will be collected and sent to them.  Including things like your bank account password or credit card information from orders you have placed.\n\nI thought that this may have been a fluke since there were so many other good reviews, so I returned the first one I ordered and had them ship out another one.  It was the same thing!  I also tried calling their customer support number (during their listed business hours) and it rang three times and went to voicemail.  I tied this several times and never got through.\n\nIf you take away the wifi issues, lack of storage and the fact that it is rooted, the device actually performs pretty well for a budget tablet.  But these issues may it a \"wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole\" for me."}

I purchased this as a homeschooling aid for our family so that my children would be able to use education apps on it. I loved the price and the large screen.\n\nEverything was fine for the first few days, however then the tablet started restarting itself in the middle of use. I sent an email to the customer service of TabletExpress, heard no response and sent another email almost two weeks later and mentioned if I didn't hear anything I would be going to Amazon Customer service, amazingly enough I got a replay the next day.\n\nI was very unimpressed with the unprofessional, condescending email I received. The person who wrote it (didn't sign their name) threw their coworkers under the bus because they hadn't been able to keep up the work while they were on vacation, and repeatedly used the phrase \"Please make sure you're using the product correctly\" which I was. They also included this line, which my husband and I laughed for days about: \"Also if the app you run is big, it may overburden the ram and cause shutting off during operation.\" Then why in the world are you putting your name on this product and selling it?!? If you're telling me this product can't handle apps coming out nowdays, then how are you planning on creating a business with it? The tablet even crashed running Chrome, a program that comes installed on it!!\n\nThe only helpful thing in the email was they recommended a factory reset, which fixed the restarting problem for a few days. However it started up again, the same day I was planning on writing customer service (for the third time) I dropped the tablet, cracked it, and now it's no longer working correctly, I'm not sure if I could return or exchange it at this point, and honestly I'm not sure I'd want to.\n\nTo Summarize: I regret buying this and wish I'd saved my money for a better tablet. Disappointed in my interactions with the seller as well."}

I ended up buying a HP stream 7 from Microsoft and am very happy with that (windows tablet). If looking for a basic tablet this should fit your needs.

I intended to use this tablet mainly to view PDF's and PowerPoint presentations so that I can use my laptop's whole screen space to do the actual work. I also wanted to be able to use the device to read magazines on Zinio and watch videos on Netflix and Youtube.\n\nPROS:\n-Physical build quality is good for the price point. It doesn't feel like a terribly cheap device.\n-Price is pretty low for a device with this screen size\n\nCONS:\n-I'm not sure if it's the processor or the lack of ram (only 512mb) but this device felt under-powered for my pretty basic needs. PDF's viewed OK, but PowerPoint presentations were definitely laggy and took a while to load. Youtube was unwatchable at 720p, but fine at 480p. Netflix played fine with no noticeable lag. Reading magazines via Zinio was difficult, and scrolling between pages / trying to zoom in on articles produced lots of lag issues.\n-Screen has a narrow viewing angle\n-Wireless connectivity was an issue. It would randomly drop connection and had overall poor reception even when close to my Wifi router. This was especially aggravating when trying to download larger apps (it took me 4 times to successfully download MS PowerPoint)\n\nIf you have very basic needs for this tablet it may work for you (basic web surfing, watching low resolution video, etc), but apparently my demands were a bit much for this device. The performance combined with the wifi issues make this product a return for me. I am in the process of buying another tablet (Dragon Touch M8) which promises an improved screen, somewhat improved processor, and double the ram for around $35 more than the A93."}

It is not that I am one of those who is anti technology, I just have been using the good old lap top.\n\nI like this tablet as it honestly is just a giant version of my phone. I set it up with the same apps and settings and love it. I can read my eBooks (I use PDF format and had to download a special reader app), listen to MP3's (sound is not bad, but be realistic and don't expect big money quality) and watch videos I had previously downloaded (AVI format).\n\nThe only thing I did not like was the amount of memory. Small enough to be eaten up when adding apps. For the price I don't expect much but for convince sake it would have been nice to have an option to purchase a memory card with the tablet... I am quite sure everyone who buys this will be wanting to add memory.\n\nOn a side note, as this will not apply to everyone but those it does will appreciate the info, this fits perfect in a Lowepro Photo Traveler 150 backpack. It also works fine with all the Canon camera apps. I have yet to try editing on the go with this but when everything is all said and one it does display photos well enough to pass around the bar to show off your latest adventure.\n\n--Note: A card with the tablet says that if you contact the company after doing a review they will send you a free protective case. I do review all I purchase anyway but also make note if anything like this. I also update my review based on if the company follows through with its promises or not. Star rating will not be improved, it is a four star tablet. I will decrease for deceptive business practices on the other hand. Will note here if I receive this case or not.\n\nCurrent status: Not received\n\nUpdate: Card says to contact review@tabletexpress.com for your free case. That company had me submit screen captures of orders and my contact information (makes me wonder why, was very careful not to give personal information as I suddenly felt uneasy with what they where asking me to do). They later said that I did not order from them but from a company called Warehouse Deals, Inc. that I now see listed as the seller on Amazon. Seems to be some kind of bait and switch. I also get an uneasy feeling about the sudden change in company name. Makes me wonder what is going on and if the tablet should be checked out for spy ware or other identity theft tid bits.\n\nI have adjusted my star rating to reflect this experience and very uneasy feeling about the product. I think money can be spent safer with a more reputable business."}

When I received the tablet, I was surprised to find that it already had a plastic screen cover in place with what looked like dandruff in addition to dust caught underneath. Figured it was only $70 or so, so I couldn't complain too much. The battery meter seemed to be rigged to always say 100% or something close to that, despite constant use--I chalked that up to a bug in Android 4.4. The screen quality's not great, but again, $70. The screen did seem to be installed upside-down, but okay... maybe it was supposed to be that way. So I put up with it because I really just wanted a tablet for basic e-mail checking, occasional websurfing, and reading e-books.\n\nBut then my tablet just... died... while sitting on my desk. Conveniently, just two days after the return window closed.\n\nI guess that take-home point is that you get what you pay for."}

I was duped badly.\n\nThe device's screen is completely horrible. First, it has a blue hue to the screen. If you open up Chrome and look at a blank page what should be a white screen has a strange off-blue color to it. Second, the text is fuzzy and unreadable. It was giving me a headache within minutes of unboxing the device. If you tilt the device at all the pixels wash out so badly you can't see anything. If you can still see anything, the pixels shift so badly as the device is tilted you can't focus well on it. This, among the reasons I'm about to detail, were why I returned it the same day I received it. I mean, the entire device IS a screen. If the screen is bad of what use is the device?\n\nWhen I received it the screen also had a piece of plastic or hair or something manufactured right into the screen itself. It was underneath the touchscreen on the lower right portion of the device. I picked at it. Looked at it as closely as I could. It was a piece of something that got under the screen as the device was being built. It would always be there. Always be a nuisance. I can't believe any kind of QA personnel didn't catch this.\n\nThe device is listed as an 8GB storage device. When I opened up the settings and looked at the available storage? 4GB. They sent the wrong device.\n\nI had originally set a $100 limit on myself for buying a low-end tablet, and this device wasn't even worth the 70 bucks I paid for it. It is quite possibly the worst piece of electronics I've ever bought off Amazon. I upped my personal limit to $200 and went with a Lenovo which is fantastic in comparison.\nI'll never buy a product from this company again."}

Other games my Samsung boggs down while playing run so smoothly on this Dragon Touch. Mine came with Android 4.4.2 and an 8gb drive that will take a 32gb external disc drive.\n\nLove this tablet. I use it as my primary tablet now and the Samsung sits on the shelf."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "I didn't have high expectations, being that this is a 'budget' tablet. My lower expectations, however, couldn't even be met. There was plastic shavings under the glass, however they didn't really bother me as they were near the edge. The screen resolution is awful. Everything looked washed out. The preloaded wallpapers loaded ok, but when I added my own, it would sometimes load funny, zoomed in and pixelated. Some basic games loaded fine, but any games that weren't very basic would either stop responding or crash. I couldn't even get web pages to load in a timely fashion. After day two of waiting 5 or more minutes for web pages to load, I gave up and returned it. This tablet might be ok for kids that are playing VERY basic games, but it's definitely inadequate for even the most basic everyday things."}

Update- its been a week now and the tablet has become very slow and glitchy. It has become very frustrating to use and it won't connect to the internet unless its one 4bars.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "This is a good tablet if you're just using it for things like reading/taking notes/ playing sudoku. I use it as a student to download my professor's lecture slides and take notes on those. It's slow at times and the wifi is so-so compared to my galaxy S4. It doesn't handle processor heavy applications but simple things like email, pdf viewers, note taking apps are no problem. It's lightweight and the battery will last for hours (which, because I only use it in class, means it'll last a couple days between charges). It's slightly smaller than a composition notebook and should fit in most labcoat pockets. The camera is crap, but that's what you get for being the kind of person who'd use a tablet to take a photo. I got this tablet, a Sandisk 32GB micro usb flash drive, and a Sandisk ultra 32 GB micro SD card and they all play well together. I'm giving it 5 stars because despite all of its limitations it's a great deal for the price.\n\nUpdate 8/18/2015\nMy tablet has now found new purpose as an inexpensive piece of lab equipment. With a free app and an audio line I can use it as a reliable function generator that was cheaper and more precise than what I could find elsewhere."}

Where else can you get a tablet with 8GB of internal storage that is expandable to 128 GB of external storage, coupled with a good quad core processor.

That being said, keep the price in mind.\n\nI managed to buy this tablet, a cover for it, and get 2-day delivery, for less than $100. You won't get that anywhere else.\n\n3/30/15 - Having owned and used the tablet for a few weeks now, I'm still fairly happy with it. My only real problem, besides the screen, is the lack of RAM.

Before I received this tablet, within three days, I ordered and returned two different $69 tablets (including a NeuTab N9 Pro) with identical specs and they were both lemons. Finally, I picked a winner with this Dragon Touch A93 9\" Quad Core. It outperforms the Kocaso M9200 that I was using for the last year (1 year ago, that sold for $149). This tablet runs multiple applications quickly and smoothly. For me, (maybe not for gamers) I've downloaded all the apps I need and still have several GBs of storage available. If I needed it, this tablet does allow for a Micro SD card, and those are totally inexpensive. Facebook, FB Messenger, GMail, Chrome, etc, all work perfectly. I do use Netflix frequently, and the picture is superior to other comparable tablets, as is the sound. With the expensive Kocaso, I had to take the tablet out of its case to hear Netflix. In contrast, this tablet's volume is PLENTY loud. Netflix and other videos can be heard easily, even when in a case. The power adapter is NOT an issue at all!! The connector is a bit unusual; however, if you push the cable in gently until it \"clicks\" into place, the connection becomes secure and works perfectly. The battery life is great - I don't have to recharge for days at a time. For games, I only play Words and QuizUp, and they work well, but I haven't attempted any \"gaming\". The manufacturer provides an email and phone number in case you need to contact them for any kind of support. I did a lot of research comparing tablets in this price range with comparable specs. If you want the best possible tablet for a price under $100 (let alone, under $70), this is the tablet to purchase."}

I received 2 A93 tablets and the are both terrible. The color for the display is off and difficult to look at, and they run very slowly. In addition, they are NOT upgradable, so you are stuck with an older, less efficient, Android OS. The actual screen is  thin plastic instead of glass, so it WILL scratch (mine scratched when wiped gently with a clean microfiber cloth). In addition, I recommend checking the dimensions (my bad on this part) as it is long and thin and makes reading documents or comic books painful.

HD video plays just fine on this device, despite the lack of RAM.  If you write a positive review about this tablet on Amazon.com you get a free tablet case in the mail from the maker, as well.  Shipping was fast, and the fake leather backing is a classy, user-friendly touch.\n\nBut the Dragon Touch's screen is excessively bright to the point of washing out color and contrast, bubbles under the screen were an issue on my new model, front and rear cameras are flip-phone quality, 512MB of RAM was constantly bottle-necked, and after 6 months to the tee (like several other reviewers have reported) my tablet would take 5 or more reboots to turn on.  WI-fi would then proceed to cut out every ten minutes.  Restoring factory settings, hard resets, swapping MicroSD cards, etc did nothing to bring this tablet back to life.  The nail in the coffin was during a corporate relocation, when the tablet was slightly bent in my travel-on luggage, and the screen cracked like I had hit it with a baseball bat; with the backlight stuck on until it died.\n\nIt is an inexpensive tablet, but it doesn't have enough RAM nor color/ contrast for gaming despite the size/ specs. The Wi-fi lacks range and isn't conducive for web browsing longer than ten minutes.  The build quality is not at a level where I would feel comfortable having a rough and tumble kid use it for games.  In the end, this tablet was a good learning experience for me, even though I was out $60.  I would prefer a smaller tablet with more RAM and better build quality any day of the week."}

I have no idea what all the \"positive\" reviews are about because this tablet is a truly a piece of crap.\n\nOverall connectivity and usability weren't an issue.  Even though I am a regular Mac/Windows user, I had very few problems adapting to and navigating the Android OS.But web browsing was kinda slow. The other problems I had was not being able to add the AdBlock extension to the Chrome browser and not being able to play flash based online content, streaming videos etc. This was the reason I got the tablet in the first place. That was my fault for not doing enough research on the android OS. Anyway, There are apps like Puffin and Dolphin etc. that can run flash-based content for Android. Even though this was not something I had planned on doing I got the app anyway. The picture results were so unbelievably bad that it defies comprehension. That said, even with all those shortcomings I would have been satisfied if the screen was somewhat acceptable. I cannot stress how bad the screen of this tablet is. I'll repeat it; THE SCREEN IS BEYOND HORRIBLE.\n\nMethinks either people posting these  rave reviews have no idea what a good tablet is or, these reviews need to be seriously investigated. The Dragon Touch A93 9\" ain't a 4-star tablet by any stretch of the imagination. In my mind it's barely a 1 star tablet.\n\nMy kids got two Kurio Android tablets for Christmas and I got an HP Stream 7. When I compare the screens of those tablets to this Dragon Touch its really, really, really difficult to grasp how this thing got any positive reviews at all. This tablet is rubbish."}

I bought this.  And am surprised and how good this is for the price I paid. The screen resolution took some getting used to. It changes colour depending on which way u hold it.  But this is the only fault I can find. Iv had it a month now and has great battery life, and the large screen also makes gaming a lot more fun.  For the money, u can't go wrong with this.  Obviously, the more advanced u need a tablet to be, ur gonna have to look at others. For lite Internet users, facebook, checking emails, games etc? This is perfect"}

The only really annoying thing is that I added a 32gb microsd card and am not currently able to install anything on it. I want to install a game on it but it sends it to the onboard memory, which is too small for it. Otherwise I am loving the tablet so far."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "I had such high hopes for this product and have been incredibly disappointed.  We are a family of programmers, high school students and such.  In our household there are 8 other computers and all play nicely on the wireless network.  This tablet is turned on and it blocks ALL other traffic on the wireless network.  It is consuming ALL of the wireless resources and none of the other computers can break through it's lock on the wireless.  We tried setting up a separate wireless modem for just it and it still blocks ALL wireless traffic , irregardless of which modem it is connecting to,  it is not channel specific.  As I said, we are a house of techies.  Many hours have been spent with tools to measure packet speed, upload and download from other computers and such.  This machine doesn't even have to be downloading anything.  When we turn it on and it connects to the wireless it destroys the connection for everyone else.  I've never encountered a product that can take out 8 computers at once.  We have gone through many diagnostics, changed settings (both on tablet and modems) , etc. etc. etc.  It is not solvable.  I got this for my 12 year old son for Christmas.  What a disappointment.  He is only allowed to connect to the internet for small periods of time, with permission so he doesn't kill the rest of us, and then he has to get off.  For him it is a glorified book reader - not the tablet it was advertised to be.  I am absolutely disgusted with this product."}

First off, the manual enclosed was for a different model entirely.  If this is your first tablet or first time with KitKat, you may have difficulty figuring things out. Secondly, the screen came loose and nearly fell out completely on several occasions.  This seems to be a common complaint.  I suppose the buyer could glue it in better, but it should have been manufactured properly in the first place.  I did phone the number enclosed for help, but got a recording twice stating that they were experiencing high volumes of calls, and to try emailing them.  The customer service at Tablet Express did call back promptly, but I had already printed a return label to send back to Amazon.\nMust say it has a nice screen resolution and quick processor for this price point.\nI thought the headphone jack was a bit flimsy.\nThe screen is quite sensitive and I was hitting the screen shot function inadvertently on a regular basis.\nBattery life was okay, but be sure to follow directions for initial charging.\nI didn't use the camera, so I have no comment for that other than to say if you want nice pictures, get a nice camera!\nThe WiFi worked fine for me and connected easily.\n\nWell folks, you get what you pay for... as the saying goes."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "I chose this tablet because the good reviews outweighed the bad.  Wrong choice.\nl bought this tablet for my daughter for Chrismas this past year. It was a step up from the generic tablet that she got last year, which was far better than this junk.\nAt first it was ok.  I honestly wasn't expecting much for the low price. But after just a month, (unfortunately longer than the Amazon return time limit for defects) it just stopped working. It won't turn off unless the battery dies, and when it is on it just stays on the \"dragon touch\" screen never going to the android load screen. And it gets worse.....\nThe tablet that we got for her Christmas 2013 was still working just fine. It was a Nextbook,  a smaller tablet with a generic OS (not android). When we got the dragon touch tablet, my husband started using her old tablet and they would connect to play pocketcraft together. When the dragon touch stopped working they were connected and playing pocketcraft at the time. Within a few hours of the dragon touch dying, the Nextbook also went out, doing exactly the same thing that the dragon touch was doing, not powering off and staying on the main screen never loading the OS. I have been able to reinstall the firmware for the Nextbook and it is working fine again. The dragon touch is not recognizing the firmware downloads from the tablet express website.\nI have made several attempts to contact tablet express by both email and phone and have never gotten a response.  It's already past Amazon's return time limit and I don't hold out any hope of ever getting a response from tablet express. Money down the drain and a very sad 7 year old."}

Screenshot and screen recording features were great as I use this for watching webinars at times.\n\n2 stars for display - at this price I obviously wasn't expecting much, but something is funny about the backlighting and the resolution as I feel I'm going cross-eyed looking at the screen. I got a second one just to make sure the first one wasn't faulty. If you're used to high resolution displays or have any kind of light sensitivity, this tablet with probably not work for you."}

I can read my e-books on it and I suppose that was the main reason for getting a tablet but I would suggest saving up and buying something better.

The onscreen keyboard works way better than my smartphone's one does.  It plays both of the games I like (Clash of Clans & Boom Beach) without any problems.  YouTube videos (even the HD ones) play flawlessly.  I've also watched two movies and two TV episodes in HD without any problems.  I do recommend that you charge the battery for a full 10 hours before using it for the first time.  Like other people here have said in their reviews of the A93, it'll help extend your battery life by a couple of hours.  Also like other people have mentioned, the speaker and the front and rear cameras aren't that great.  I'm fine with that since I always use headphones, and I only use the cameras for Skype.  But, for other people, they might be an issue.  Also, it does not have Bluetooth capability.  Again, not an issue for me.  But, others might not like that.  Overall, though, the DragonTouch A93 is a great entry-level tablet with many cool features.  If you want a new tablet, but, like me, you're on a budget, the A93 is a great option!"}

I have a 2nd gen Nexus 7 (Still have a first) and I got this for my wife to decide if she's interested in moving from her IOS to Android. The upside is we would be on the same platform. There some obvious reasons this is a $65 tablet. The plastic casing is very \"plastic\" and the screen is good but not HD by anymeans , although I was surprised at how well  You Tube displayed viewing the Dragon Touch instructional video. It synced up to my google account perfectly and the touch screen was very responsive to my touch. Speed is not blazing but adequate. My concerns so far is the wall charger. Its an old style round insert pin. It works but I have no idea where to find the car charger. Time will tell the final story but I did get this because of the many favorable reviews it recieved. Two features I wish my Nexus 7 had was a USB port and an SD card slot. I purchased and mounted a 32gb San disk as soon as I got this tablet signed up and synced up. I have little doubt after  using this and getting comfortable with Android my wife will want to upgrade to a Galaxy 10 . When that happens this unit will be the one I take camping or use as my Google Play audio library plugged directly into my amp (it doesn't have blue tooth, no biggie.

It performs everything I need it to do quite well.\nAs others have noted, it's biggest issue is the poor camera quality (think cell phone pics from 1990s), but one can't really complain at these prices!\nThe only other issue with this tablet is that the power supply plug end that goes into the tablet is too long, so that can be a fragile spot while charging.\nI would definitely recommend this tablet for those that want a great deal on an entry level tablet."}

The screen is good and bright sound is OK for the price but what it lacks is gaming capability. pretty much every game I have loaded just ends up crashing and won't play for more than a minute or two. Now I knew I was buying a cheap tab to get me started but after reading the reviews I expected to play the games I play. I have tried pinball,racing,shooter's and they load but like I said within a very short time they all crash. I put in the 32 gig memory card thinking I was just running out of men but it didn't help. I'm no tablet expert but I figured this would play all the games my g3 phone would play but that's not the case. I gave two stars for bright screen and speed.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "Caveat: I purchased this tablet to be a test device for Android development work, not as my daily-use tablet, so my rating is from that perspective. From a general-use standpoint, the screen is a bit washed out (anything on a light background is the worst) and the DPI is clearly sub-par. However, considering the price, I'm not counting that against it. Just don't expect an iPad or higher-end Android display here.\n\nThe major issue (from a developer perspective) I ran into was that ADB would not recognize the tablet. After a couple hours of searching forums and trial and error, I found that I could use the Samsung ADB driver that I had installed for an older Fascinate phone I have, and adb works fine now. But they really should document that on their website; there is no documentation for the A93 anywhere, other than the sales sheet.\n\nThe other issue I have is the power cable -- it is a poor design in my opinion. The connector only goes halfway into the tablet, and there is no tactile feedback for when the connector is seated. It is very easy to jar loose as well. I connected it to power, set the tablet down, and came back later only to find it hadn't charged at all due to the cable wiggling enough to disconnect it, even though it appeared to be connected.\n\nAs a development/test device, it does what I want it to do.

Because I was so impressed with the first A93 I purchased another one, the next day, to replace it.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase.  I am not very tech savvy, but the A93 does exactly what I purchased it for.  I am a photographer and take a lot of senior, family  and sports pictures.  I wanted something I could display the pics to show my subjects immediately after taking the pics.  I use a card reader and an USB adapter I purchased thru Amazon, and connect this to the A93.  Pics are sharp and have good color.  A lot better than trying to look at a small camera screen.  I have also downloaded pics, videos, and music to the tablet from my PC.  I know that the A93 does at lot more, and with the help of my grandkids, I will learn.  But, for now, this tablet is perfect for my needs.  I also purchased a case with keyboard and a 16gb SD card thru Amazon and couldn't be happier.  The battery life seems to real good."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "I was looking for a \"beginners\" table for an adult and this seems to fit the bill. I'm one of those people who has a smart phone, but only use it to make calls, text, and sometimes check email. The screen is just too small for anything else with my old eyes. But I'm planning on taking a couple of road trips this spring and summer, and wanted to keep in touch with kids/grandkids without taking a laptop. Thus I have entered the tablet age.\n\nI didn't want to get an expensive \"do everything including your laundry\" model - it would just be over kill for me. I just wanted something to keep in touch with everybody, play my  games, and read my books. This size (9\") is perfect for this. I did install a 32g sd card so I know I have room for a movie or two and any tunes I want to load.\n\nUpdate: 8-20-2016  Dropped from 4 stars to 2 stars.\n\nLast years trips were put on hold and this was put away. Finally brought it out a couple of months ago to get it ready of new vacation plans. Tried to load a couple of Facebook games, but the tablet kept acting like it was timing out- game would start to load, after a few seconds the screen would go black, and then back to the home page. Decided to do a \"factory reset\" and start fresh. Nope, same thing happened. Sometimes I would get as far as the game loading but before I could even play it the screen would go black again and back to the home page. This happened with DoubleDown Casino, Spin it Rich Slots, Candy Crush Soda, Hit it Rich. Slots, Slotomania, Candy Crush Jelly, Big Fish Casino, and Caesars Slots. Email customer support, got a note back saying to do a factory reset (already done twice) and to include the tablets serial number with correspondence. Since I registered my table right after I got it, they have all my info. I just wanted to know if I was doing something wrong or if there was some setting I needed to change, or what.\n\nI'm leaving it at 2 stars instead of just 1 since I can still play a few off-line games, listen to music, and use it as an e-reader. I really wanted to use this more because of the screen size but that's not gonna happen. I also have a  Fire 7&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Fire-Tablet-7-34-Display-Wi-Fi-8-GB-Includes-Special-Offers-Black/dp/B00TSUGXKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fire Tablet, 7\" Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offers, Black</a>.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "I wanted a 8-9\" tablet and being on a tight budget at the moment I didn't want to shell out another couple hundred dollars or more so I thought I'd go for this budget tablet based on the positive reviews.  First, let me say, the company offers you a free case if you give a 5-star review.  Sort of puts all these 5-star reviews into question knowing that.  They also offer to resolve any issues you have, but I have not had need to contact the company.  On the whole this tablet seems satisfactory for my needs as a budget tablet.  The only question I'm still working out is that it seems to have a harder time locking onto the wifi than any of my other devices ever have.  In some places this isn't a problem, but in other places it may mean I can't get wifi on this device while my other devices work.  I've been playing videos, reading kindle app, facebooking, and playing a lot of Dragon Storm (too much) and the graphics seem perfectly adequate for that to me, while understanding that if primo quality graphics are important to you this is probably not the tablet for you.  I just hope, when I can afford to rejoin the gym, it will hold the wifi signal long enough to play netflix while I'm on the cardio equipment, because that is one of the main things I specifically need these tablets for.  I will try to remember to come back and let you know.\nUPDATE:  It's been a couple years.  It seems to work fine enough at the gym to keep connected to wifi enough to watch netflix, so that's great.  Only problem I have with it really is that the headphone jack seems to be imperfect so when I stick the headphone jack in I have to find a \"sweet spot\" to get the headphones to work."}

We have not had it long enough to rate durability but appears surprisingly solid. Two minor criticisms: the launcher that came with it was not optimal; it placed app icons over the Google search bar. That was fixed by replacing with a better launcher available from the Google app store (Nova launcher), an easy and effective fix. The charger uses a non-USB style connector to a dedicated DC port. But it appears to charge through the USB port also, but don't know if that is equivalent to the dedicated DC port. You can get replacement chargers by searching Amazon, so not a major issue. I would recommend this as a very cost effective way to get a decent 9 inch Android tablet for about $70. I have seen what appears to be an identical tablet sold under the RCA name in a major retail store and it was priced at $139."}

I use my tablet for fb, twitter, email and netflix but I use it all day. The battery life is amazing. With one full charge, I'm getting at least seven hours of usage and standby time. Right now it is at 89% and I've had it on for over three hours with light usage.\n\nThe only ding is that it had a small little bubble under the screen that's on the casing but does not obstruct the viewing area. The camera and video are ok but that's not why I bought it.\n\nI am pleased with my purchase. Bottom line this is a great value. Do not expect $500 quality for $72!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "I bought two of these tablets just before Christmas.  Both arrived with the packaging air pillows broken so the tablets in my opinion were not protected since they are electronic devices.  They were sliding all around the shipping box so that does concern me and how it might affect their longevity and if it will affect the performance.  I was not happy seeing that when I opened the boxes.  The other thing I am a little disappointed in is the battery charger plug does not fit all the way seated into the device.  When plugged into the device a small section remains outside of the plug and I was afraid to try and push it all the way in.  For me the wifi is a little weak in some of my rooms but that may be due to our router. I wish it had been stated in the product write up that this tablet DOES include a screen protector.  Not knowing that in advance I purchased two different versions on Amazon which in actuality I did not need.  One did not fit the screen size anyway so that was a waste. The 3 pack for now I will just hold onto for when I am ready to replace the one the tablet came with.  That was a nice surprise I must say as putting on protectors can be so frustrating, time consuming and expensive. On the positive side for the money you can't go wrong with this tablet.  I have had the Android OS in my expensive smart phones and also on  my Nexus 7.  This tablet works pretty darn good for the most part and I like the size for typing on the keyboard vs both my phone and Nexus 7.  For fun I also ordered the matching keyboard folio and again for the price, I like it.  It's nice to have a stand to prop the tablet up and the keys work good.  Be sure to carefully take the tiny piece of plastic that covers the camera lens on the BACKSIDE of the tablet.  I didn't notice that the first few days but when I looked closely I could see it had a very THIN piece of protective plastic.  That will improve the quality and the complaints about the photos being grainy.  It's still won't be perfect but certainly acceptable.  I am overall very happy with this tablet that I have been using for a few weeks now. I am having lots of fun exploring all the things it really can do.  Don't be afraid to experiment and open settings and change them.  This is an inexpensive powerhouse of options with some exploring.  I did buy a 32 GB SD with the idea I would get the most out of the tablet.  The 4 stars is only due to the few negative issues listed in the intro of the review."}

We'll mainly use it for e-reading, video chatting through Skype and Internet surfing. The e-reading and surfing has work really well, we haven't try Skype yet.

IT says it supports 3D gming,which is amazing at this price,but I downloaded Five Night's at Freddy'z and Scribblenaughts. The latter ran alright with almostno lag which is awesome, but the former just crashed at startup, so maybe I have to look at thier required specs.

It is responsive, very little lag and lets me read and browse the internet from my bed instead of having to be up at the computer! I'm using it primarily as an ereader, so I am not using it for gaming or anything like that. Youtube videos are crisp, and I'd presume that movies would play well on it.\n\nAll in all, it's a great budget tablet. Vibrant, large screen, very little bloatware right out of the box! If you are expecting an i-pad quality device at this price point, you'd be sadly mistaken, but if you have kids or just want a nice travel tablet or an e-reader with \"extra\" features for the same price as some black and white reader models, you'll be pleased.\n\nI also purchased a 32 GB Micro SD card to go with this as the internal memory does leave something to be desired, but if you are serious about books/music/pictures/etc you'll have already thought about that before and will already own one or consider picking one up as they are very affordable.\n\nGood stuff though so I highly reccomend giving this one a go if you are looking for an inexpensive option!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "The shipping was very fast.  I have a laptop computer that I use and like perfectly fine, so I wanted an inexpensive starter unit just to see if I would even like or use a tablet that much.  The setup was fine, WIFI set up quickly, downloading apps is very quick, and the screen and sound seems to be quite good.  Apps seem to respond about as quickly as my cell phone, and browsing, scrolling, etc. seem very good.  The only concern I have right now is that the battery seems to drain extremely fast.  I picked it up fully charged this morning, did just a few things from 9:30 am to 10:00 am, then was occupied with other things until about 5:00 pm, and when I picked it back up only 7 hours later, the battery was all the way down to 40% just sitting dark.  I currently have an email into the company to see if they think the unit is defective or if there is some settings I may need to tweak.\n\n**UPDATE** 1/13/15\nAfter getting into more of a regular use schedule after the holidays, the battery has \"learned\" and is now doing very well, it is not an issue.  I plug it in overnight just like my cell phone, and even after a fair amount of use through the day it only goes down to around 50% or more, and it does NOT drain quickly anymore.  However, now having more use under my belt, I do have to say that the tablet isn't especially speedy, but again, I think it is fine for a general use, starter tablet, and I enjoy using it."}

I've used it for a few hours actively, and had it sleeping for a couple days, and it used half the battery.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "This review is for the Dragon Touch A93 9\" quad Core Google Android 4.4 KitKat Tablet PC which I purchased from Tablet Express.  The product was very promptly shipped and arrived in good order.  It was well packaged.  However, when we unpacked both of the tablets and peeled back protective plastic sheet there were air bubbles trapped under the display.  In the first table these were localized to the edges.  The second tablet had the same problem but also had spots where dust or some material was trapped under the display, creating perfect 3-4mm circles.  At first we thought these might be part of the laptop, but they clearly were not as the camera was clearly visible and there was nothing else they could be based on the instructions.  We didn't power up the first one but we did power up the second one, thinking we might keep it anyway since it was quit affordable.  It booted up fine and looked to be a pretty standard Android tablet however after a few minutes we decided we would rather spend a little more and get a better quality device.  So we are shopping for another purchase.  The vendor clearly cares about their product and there were instructions in the package asking we consider calling the vendor to resolve any problem we may have.  However, we opted to look for for something else and just returned it through Amazon.  I gave this a one-star rating because this is a obvious quality control problem that should not have escaped the manufacturer and for which there is really no excuse."}

And I overlooked some tiny scratches on the screen, and a problem with the sound card. Without headphones, the sound is pretty good. You could actually listen to something, as long as there was no background noise. But with two different headphones and or computer speakers, you could hardly hear anything. Even that, I was going to overlook, because the picture and battery life was very good and it booted so fast.\n\nBut one of the things that I do most on tablets is voice search. I also dictate my emails. In fact, I'm dictating this right now on another cheap tablet. but the voice search was so ineffective as to be comical. It's also quite slow, but of course, a half a gigabyte of RAM is not much. But you don't expect too much I'm such an inexpensive tablet. I gave up, I sent it back, and I finally ordered a little better quality - a Samsung tablet.\n\nEDIT: So I turned the headphone jack in its socket many times, and finally the sound came up and it has stayed up for several days. Then I installed and configured Google Plus. And now I use that for voice search, and it works. (So it was not a bad mike.)\n\nThere was a glitch with the battery meter, but I just kept it going, and eventually, the battery level went down, and now it's working again.\n\nI gave it one more star and decided to keep it for work and the bath tub.  The refurb Samsung is awesome, but I'm scared to use it. :-/"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "I intitually bought this for my daughter.  The first thing that I noticed right away was the quality of the picture. It almost seemed as it was faded, the kind of the quality I can compare to a newspaper, just horrible. When you turn the device to an angle, the quality gets much lower. The second thing I noticed was the sound didn't work, even after I put the volume all the way up. I put in headphones and it still didn't work. The button was broken. Of course, I called Amazon for a replace which I had to reorder all again before Amazon could reimburse me. This was a Christmas gift and I was stuck reordering. I spoke with Amazon and ended up going with a different tablet which they did reimburse me half the price of the new tablet. While the price is unbeatable, the reviews seem almost stretched. I always go with the reviews first but this one is VERY misleading. I gave it one star for the price and one star for its overall usefullness. It can still download apps and do daily reading somewhat. The quality was horrible, the sound didn't work, and the headache it took me to return and replace it."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "After an extensive search for an inexpensive tablet I purchased 4 of these for various family members, they weren't for anything special just a tablet to get on the internet and play games with.  Most of the reviews were positive, and it seemed perfect for what it would be used for.  Unfortunately these tablets didn't even come close to what the reviews said.  The internet was ridiculously slow, over 5 minutes to open Google search page.  We thought that maybe there were to many devices trying to connect to the internet so we turned off everyones wireless except 1 tablet and it was no different.  There was a \"fast\" internet setting but I didn't notice a difference.  The controls were cumbersome, where my Samsung phone has 3 buttons on the phone that control most of the features the tablet had like 5 buttons on the interface and I never got used to them.  The reviews said the camera was bad and it was, looked worse than my flip phone from 2005.  Perhaps with more practice the buttons would become second nature, but after waiting all night to search something on Google all tablets were shipped back the next day."}

First impressions are as follows: the camera is mediocre, not really good quality.  the wifi is slow with downloads in comparison to other devices. touchscreen is reactive so no problems there. set up is android so no need to learn a new os.\nThe thing that is troublesome to me however is the complete misrepresentation of memory. The storage on this device is 1.97 GB and 2.68 GB total stock respectively...nowhere near the 8GB as described. Not sure why they do this, it's easy to see the storage space in settings. At least its expandable via micro SD. At mid $70 range, it is what it is...."}

This one was so much better I bought two more one to replace a galaxy tablet and another to replace an old kindle (sorry Amazon). It also has a larger screen than comparable tablets (which are usually 7-8 inches). The larger screen was a plus for watching videos and playing games.

It connected to the home network just fine and I was poking away in just  few minutes. Now for the caution. It says 8 G memory, well I only see about 6 and a lot of that is used by the stuff on the device. The program I wanted to load takes 3.8 G to install and it will not load as it cant find enough memory. There appears to be a solution- buy a good sized micro sd card when you order this. I have one on the way to see if this will allow me to finish the install. It might be worth the vendors time to list the 8 G and then how much is useable.\nUPDATE:  the 16G sd card did not help the tablet to load the program, it still only sees its memory and doesn't access the mounted sd memory.\nSo be careful of the memory you need. I think its overall all good product just did not meet my need."}

We had the new tablet and within one week the screen cracked.  I called the company and they said that a cracked screen does not fall under the warranty and there was nothing they can do.  The screen does not work at all.  They told me there is one place on ebay to order a screen from.  The screen is 29.99 and is on order but not available for shipping for 6-8 weeks.

Another big problem is that Amazon has not yet released an app that will allow you to stream Prime Instant Videos. I think that you should know that ahead of time if you are planning to use this tablet primarily to view view those movies as I did.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "Only been messing with it for about an hour.  But so far it is comparable to the high end tablets.  It has a fast response time, and streams video nice from places like Netflix and hulu+.  It came fully charged and with a screen protector. As I've only just received it I will provide more later if need be.  It will serve my needs well.  I didn't need anything smancy fancy, but so far it exceeds the expectations I had."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "First, let me tell you why I bought this tablet. I wanted an inexpensive device that I could download all of my e-reader apps to in order to have all my books in the same place. Before I bought this table I had separate e-readers for Amazon, e-pub, and nook. So very not fun. I had parts of series on different readers.\n\nThe Dragon Touch A93 let me download e-reader apps from all my sellers on one device. I was afraid I was going to have to download each book to the tablet. Thank goodness I was wrong about that. Each of my accounts is on the tablet. Nice! (Before you fall out of your chair laughing at my seemingly uneducated thought process about this; as my daughter did, let me just point out that I am a 56 year old woman. Just using an e-reader as opposed to books can be traumatic for me.\n\nThe Dragon Touch is less than 60 dollars to purchase from Amazon. It is lightweight and has a nice screen. I highly recommend it for light use but I could tell right away that it would never do for heavy use.\n\nThe reason I gave this review 4 stars is really a nitpick. I feel the Dragon Touch needs either a longer active battery life or a longer power supply cord. It is very frustrating to get to the last 1/3 of a book and have to either find a spot near an outlet to read or charge the tablet."}

It will be used everyday I am sure.  It was easy to set up but I am a computer geek.  The instructions could be a little better but are usable.  All in all it is a very good value for the price.

The tablet does not seem to be as firm as my Asus, especially around the camera lens and on/off switch, its a little mushy.  I did buy covers for them so I'm hoping they will last longer with the cover on, seeing that they are for my grand kids.  Guess I should buy the insurance.  However, for the price they are pretty nice and work well.  And they have Google Playstore."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "At this time I am only giving this tablet an \"it's ok\" rating as it was purchased just this Christmas as a gift.  I'll change the rating appropriately as warranted should it's performance exceed this rating or it fails to meet this current rating.\n\nUpdate (1/12/2015): My final rating is two (2) stars.\n\nWhile I'm writing this I will be purchasing a \"Fire HD\" tablet to replace this one.  The Dragon Touch does work but it has many, many flaws and performance issues. One major issue is that the screen colors seems to fade at any given time (the colorization of the display fades even with anti glare screen protection or different lighting) the display also seems to lack the vibrant colors even with it settings adjusted for the best display.  Its response time (especially on-line and initial game loading) is very laggy even when the device is in the same room as the wireless router.  My kids all have a brand name 7 tablet and I have a brand name transformer tablet, all of us loaded the exact same pages, in the same room, at the same time and individually.  The 'sevens' averaged 4 - 5 seconds per page, transformer avg. 6 - 7 seconds, and the Dragons' best time was almost a minute and several (4) timed out page loads.  May I also point out that all were using the native browser included with the tablets.  The Dragon tablet also has a tendency to simply shut-down, for no reason that I could discover. And it would need to be physically turned back on again.  I did notice that it seemed to shut-down when playing a game or loading a graphically intense website, either way it was more than I cared to worry about since I already decided to return it. Dragon boasts a 'Quad Core' but it is the slowest Quad Core I have ever used.\nMy recommendation, buy it for your kids or as a starter tablet for someone, they'll learn a lot about how to be patient and learn how to make changes to the settings and make necessary adjustments within the tablet. In the end, they become a little more tech savvy. They also learn to solve problems without assistance; and you will have received and produced more from your $80 purchase (lets call it an \"investment\") than you could have ever have received from this tablet alone. When you finally feel they're ready for a tablet of better quality, you can be certain they will more than appreciate the the down-time."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "I agree with most of the reviews that for the price, this is a very good budget tablet.  I previously bought my daughter a Samsung tab 4 10.1, and I wanted a tablet for my own but did not want to spend as much.  Although this tablet is not as robust as the Samsung, I expected that and for the price, I still give it 5 stars.  The screen resolution is not the best and forget using the camera for clear pictures, but it does what I want it to do, specifically using epub documents, checking email, light internet surfing, and all the google stuff (drive especially).  I would recommend this tablet to someone who wants to have basic functionality at a minimum price.  Don't expect this tablet, though, to be equal to an ipad or Samsung in terms of screen resolution and camera.  But if that is not your thing, I think you will be happy with what you get for the minimal price.  If I get one year of service out of this tablet, I will more than recoup my cost."}

Not effecting the functionality of the device but well see what happens to it in a few months. Aside from the bubbles on the window, it seems to have a hard time doing any downloads. I had to restart the device 3 times before it would load the google playstore (this occurred on both tablets). Same problems with loading netflix (on both tablets). The good thing is that it does work (for now), It has a nice big screen, and it was cheap."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00LVGIH7U", "review": "Have already purchased two other tablets, a nook two years ago and a Dell 8 inch android last Christmas. I liked both tablets, sold the Nook to a friend and still use the Dell which is smaller and has more ram but less total storage.  I also bought a 32gb micro card and a keyboard case to use at home. This tablet is just as described by the other 4 and 5 star raters. IT IS NOT AN APPLE IPAD OR TOP OF THE LINE SAMSUNG WHICH both cost two to four times as much but it is a great inexpensive 9 inch tablet that is easy to use.  I only wish it had an HDMI port and 1gb ram instead  of  512mb. The reason I purchased is to supplement by Dell which is about to crash and may not last much longer. The nine inch screen is also a size I like better than 10 inch as it is easier to take on trips.  For an inexpensive tablet, I prefer this tablet over my wife's 11 inch laptop which which cost 5 times as much or her IPAD 2 which is a lot heavier and more expensive."}

I have had a couple of phones and a tablet with older releases of Android, and they just did not measure up in features and reliability.

Note that many of the cases being sold on line as compatible with this device are not compatible, because the location of the camera lens is different on this model.\n\nThe biggest danger now is that my older daughter will figure out how to break *her* tablet so that I will have to buy one of these for her."}

I wanted it to be an intuitive learning experience without overly sophisticated operations and its absolutely been that but its capabilities were surprisingly well suited for much more complex functionality and multitasking. Great tablet for all ages!"}

It's fast, has a nice clear 1024 x 600 resolution screen display and is a nice size. It connected right away to my home Wi-Fi network after entering the security code and I went right to the Google Play Store, logged in to my Google account and downloaded some of my favorite apps and simple games, like card games and such. (Keep in mind that memory and processor intensive games won't run well or may crash on a tablet like this, in this price range. Many of the games out there these days are pretty sophisticated.)  With the quad core, the download and installation went fast. I like the Android 4.4 (Kit Kat) because the interface is very customizable. I spent the next half hour or so downloading some new wallpapers and arranging everything the way I like. I love the ease of dragging things around on the screen and finding a clock that I like. There are so many possibilities. Then I got the Kindle reading app and checked out this tablet for reading. The actual Kindle tablet is still the best for books but It's a lot more expensive. This tablet does a perfectly good job and is easy on the eyes as well as the pocketbook.\n\nThe capacitive, multi-touch technology makes the screen sensitive to the touch. Pinching and expanding gestures are very responsive and fast. I am adding a video so you can get an idea of what the tablet looks like. Please keep in mind that by compressing the video in order to uplpad it here, it loses a little and actually looks nicer when you have it in front of you.\nA sample was provided for testing and review."}

My wife liked it too and consequently, I lost that tablet to her.  So when I was offered a discount for my next purchase, I got this A93 9 inch tablet for me.  I have had no issues with TE customer service, all my orders from TE have arrived quickly receiving the order within a couple days after placing the ordering.  Customer service was also quick and responsive via email with my questions as well.\n\nInside the box with the tablet are the instructions, an AC adaptor, and a mini USB to USB cable.  The specs of the tablet includes the latest android 4.4.2, quad-core CPU (1.2 ghz), 9 inch touch screen 1024x600, 8 gb storage, 512 mb ram, 2.0mp front and rear camera and wireless n.  TE warrants this for 1 year warranty.\n\nThis tablet, like most of TE tablets, is a budget level tablet that although the specs aren't as high end as what you would see on the latest Nexus or I-pad but this is a pretty decent budget level tablet at a pretty good price at 75 dollars. For basic web surfing, checking email and playing some games this tablet will do the job just fine. You don't have the speed or screen resolution of the more expensive tablets nor is the camera resolution as high as the more expensive tablets either but you are getting quite a bit for your money.\n\nThe tablet maybe isn't as thin as the newer and more expensive tablets but isn't as thick as you would expect and isn't heavy (weighs about 1 pound). The battery life is decent.  Like all the TE tablets I have, you do have to charge it for 10 hours the first day and second day and does take some time to recharge fully after that.  Battery life lasted all day long when I was setting this up, downloading my apps that I want (considering I lost my tablet to the wife where I had already done that), and surfing the net.  The battery life in standby mode has lasted several days without a charge. For a budget tablet that is pretty good.\n\nInitial setup was fairly easy and is similar to most android based devices. I had no issues with setting up the wireless or anything like that but like most TE budget tablets, this does not have Bluetooth ability.  I do wish that the Bluetooth feature was included, but again this is a budget level tablet.  I also made a few changes with some of the settings to my liking (I disable Mobogenie app store) but there didn't seem to be as much bloat ware on this tablet like the K7 had.  For me, although not a big deal, I do wish I could have uninstalled Mobigenie or other apps that aren't critical to the operating system. Unfortunately like most android devices you are stuck with some type of bloat ware whether it is a name brand device or not.\n\nI added an 8 Gig SD card in spare card slot on the tablet; however you can add larger SD cards. For most of TE tablets, I highly recommend adding at least an 8 gig card or you will find you have limited space for adding your apps, games, music or video. Watching videos worked fine and the screen was surprisingly bright and clear and a decent (although not true HD) resolution. The sound I felt was better than the K7 I have but don't expect Bose quality sound as again this is a budget level tablet but I am fine with that. The cameras both take decent snapshots and although not as high megapixels as more expensive tablets.  The one weird thing is I found two photos one the tablet of what appeared to be accidently taken at the TE offices.  I actually accidently took pictures myself as it has the option to unlock either directly to the camera or the tablet and before I figured that out, I had snapped some pictures of the floor.  So I assume this is how the 2 photos got on there, so whoever you are you have lovely head of hair by the way and a nice shoe.  ;-)  Once I figured out not to be so quick on the unlock swipe, I have not taken any more accidental photos.\n\nFor a budget level tablet this works very well with all of the apps, music, video, net surfing and games (although basic ones but I don't play too many tablet games anyways) that I have tried to do with it. It has been fairly speedy and will be great basic tablet for me to use on trips.  For a budget tablet it does everything (except Bluetooth) I have tried, so I am happy with it.\n4 and a half stars\n\nWith this tablet, I purchased this case.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/TabSuit-9-Tablet-Folio-Keyboard-Case-with-Stand-Universal-PU-Leather-for-Dragon-Touch-N90-Neutab-N9-N9-Pro-Astro-Queo-A912-Tablet-and-more-9-Tablets/dp/B00GTAWXL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">TabSuit 9'' Tablet Folio Keyboard Case with Stand Universal PU Leather for Dragon Touch N90 / Neutab N9/N9 Pro/ Astro Queo A912 Tablet and more 9'' Tablets</a>\n\nI received a discounted product (not free) and I do not promise a good rating or review in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.

I bought it a few years ago for my birthday (back when I was new to smartphones and tablets, didn't know much about tech stuff) and it was nothing but crap ever since. It's unbelievably slow, apps crashed constantly, notifications were delayed, and you can forget about making calls on this craplet. Sound quality sucks, like really bad. I ended up giving it to my friend, and even she got rid of it after a few weeks. THIS TABLET IS A WASTE OF $60.\n\nDo yourself a favor and just buy an older model of a well-known brand of tablets (Samsung, LG, Apple, Asus, Amazon, etc). Even some of the older models of these brands work WAY better than this garbage."}
