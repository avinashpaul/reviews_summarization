I pre-ordered and assumed I'd get it on Monday or Tuesday with my Prime delivery, but was surprised at to see it at my door today!\n\nAs for the tablet itself, so far it has been a breeze to use!  Connected to my WiFi right away and it seems pretty speedy...of course I haven't bogged it down with a bunch of junk yet.  ;-)  I logged in with my google account and before you know it, my apps were all synched over while it was charging.  I didn't want a full size tablet, this is much more portable, yet big enough to be easier to read than my Samsung Infuse for browsing, games and Kindle books. Love it so far!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Like the first review, I wasn't planning on buying this today...but after playing with the Fire and Nook and being underwhelmed with their performance, I almost left Best Buy empty handed. We stumbled upon this, and I loved it. My main problem with the other two was that they seemed very sluggish (compared to the iPad2 my fianc has). This on the other hand, is finally a quick and responsive 7\" tablet at nearly the same price as Fire. Apps just launch, graphic intensive magazine pages flow, and the touch screen keyboard is easy to use with my relatively large hands. What's more is you aren't locked into anything, get a very accurate GPS, a smart remote, bluetooth, and a nice and bright screen. I'm sure I'll be adding more praises as time goes by.\n\nOnly issue I'm having is that the compass is always 90 degrees off, it always points West instead of North. Sounds like a software issue, but time will tell. When using the GPS enabled apps, North is dead on (as you'd expect). That's the only reason I gave it four stars (I'd actually rate it a 4.8 or something, but I had to point out the issue)."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I purchased this tablet months ago when they first came out, and pretty much totally satisfied/happy with it. It has become real competition for the others and has set a new standard in quality and price. Excellent quality high resolution screen and works well. Not perfect, but close to it. I did have one problem, when using Angry Birds Rio (free version). It would re-cycle back and start over again during play. By researching blogs I found the solution. TURN ON AIRPLANE MODE during play, and the problem is gone. I have a 16GB microSD memory card in it, have downloaded 4 full length movies so far and they look great. I would recommend a 32GB card since it will accept it.  This tablet is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. (This review updated December 31, 2012.)"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "So this device just came out this morning, and I hadn't planned on buying it but I was down at my local best buy store and played with it just to see what it was and loved it! Let me say I used to have all apple stuff, apple computer, iphone, ipad, etc. Over the last year my apples have rotted, went bad and needed to be replaced. Instead of paying high dollar for all new apple stuff I went back to a windows PC, an Andorid Galaxy S2 phone, still had the iPad but it was in need of replacement.\n\nSo I got to Best Buy they didn't have these out yet but they pulled one out and let me play with it while they set up the are for the demo unit to go. I liked it, very snappy, great screen. The device comes preloaded with ICS on it, it's VERY snappy with zero lag so far.\n\nThe screen while not a retina display like the iPad is still clear enough for me. After all I'm not holding this inches from my face. if you do you get a chance to play with 1 of these before you buy go to the movies app on the device and play the life demo to see how clear and crisp the display is.\n\nIt quickly synced up with my Google account and I was already able to start downloading apps from the play store within minutes of getting it turned on.\n\nSo far this device is excellent. It feels like it's built well, the back is not as fancy as the Galaxy S2 phone however I plan on getting a case for this so the back battery panel to me doesn't matter much.\n\nI'll update this later after I get more time to play with it, so far though for $250 this is a great deal. I also played with the Kindle Fire and the Blackberry playbook both which were available for $199, but I opted to spend the $50 more for the Samsung as I've been impressed with Samsung quality over the years. (Currently my TV's, blu ray players, computer monitor, phone and now tablet are all samsung brand. They make good products in my opinion.)\n\n--UPDATE 8 hours later--\nI used the GPS on this earlier and google navigation/maps to get me to the hardware store. Ok I didn't NEED it but I wanted to test it out. I found that you MUST have internet for google maps to give you directions, I had a hotspot in my car so I turned it on and navigation worked perfect. If you don't have wifi you can still use GPS, it does lock on fast however it can't query to get you directions. If you used an offline GPS program like navigon or something that would do the trick, but YES gps is accurate and fast.\n\nI also used the bluetooth on this to stream music from the Tab 2 to my car, quality was excellent.\n\nApps and stuff, so far every app I have tried is compatible with the exception of one, and I can't remember what that one was so it was one I really didn't use much at all I guess. I have put a few games on to test it, so far so good and still no lag.\n\nHows the keyboard? It comes with stock ICS keyboard and it works well, if you start typing fast there is a tiny lag between hearing the click of the feedback and seeing the character appear, however all letters make it without any vanishing. I am looking for another keyboard though as spelling isn't built in it appears... I am probably switching to Swiftkey or swype both which appear compatible with the device.\n\nAlso, the IR Blaster = awesome! I was going to buy a $100 harmony remote for my entertainment system, well this Galaxy Tab 2 has an IR blaster built right in and the application for it is simple to configure. Less then 3 minutes I had it set to turn my TV on, control my bose sound system and also control my Tivo HD and Blu Ray player. Very slick!\n\nMore to come, if you have questions on how this works please leave them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them quickly. Also, if you find this review helpful please make sure to mark it as such!\n\n--UPDATE--\n\nMorning after, do I regret buying it? Nope, still a fantastic device and I'll tell you a few more things I found out.\n\n1. I use Dropbox on my home computer and put the app on this tablet. I also use a tivo at home and thought about how could I get my shows on my tivo to my computer then to my tablet? Well I use TivoToGo to transfer shows to my computer, then I place them in a drop box folder and they sync automatically to my dropbox account. I then on the tablet have an app (free and paid versions) called \"Folder Sync\" and I have that set to every hour check my drop box Tivo folder and download any latest tv shows my computer has copied. This means that in the morning when I leave for work my tablet has all my shows from the previous night I didn't get to watch on it so I can for instance watch one or two on my lunch break, without having to have a wifi connection at work!\n\n2. Need to make a phone call? Unfortunately this device doesn't have phone support. However Skype works great with both video calls and audio calls. You can pay for a phone number from skype (it's cheap if you wanted it) and actually treat this like a phone assuming you have wifi wherever you are. I did try google voice app, that will not allow you to make calls and use the tablet as a handset, it instead asks you what phone in your account it should call.\n\n---UPDATE 2/20/2013---\n\nI see a lot of activity on my review, big thanks to everyone that found it helpful and I love the activity. I wanted to provide an update. While I really liked Galaxy Tab 2, I did make the jump a few months back to the Google Nexus 7 and have to say that tablet has taken over as my primary device. The Galaxy Tab 2 and Nexus 7 ARE similar, however I really like the pure google/android experience that the Nexus provides. If you are on the fence, I would recommend going with the Google Nexus over the Galaxy Tab 2 at this point."}

It has the best model so far with the charging port, its not the tiny micro port, its a longer one and I've never had a problem with it at all.

The performance is dismal with painfully slow response to input and is generally laggy overall, on the order of seconds for nearly anything to happen.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I brought this way back in 2012 when it was just launch not too long ago and I've got it at a cheaper retail price than other stores here locally, which things are way expensive where I lived. This is around my budget and I was looking for a 7 inch tablet for my movie fix but seriously speaking, the display and the resolution were quite disappointing. It can't even be compare to the older generation of my Samsung mobile phone galaxy S2, which has the display resolution of 480 x 800 pixels and this tablet has display resolution of 600 x 1024 pixels. I think it lies in the differences of the ppi, which the phone has 271 ppi pixel density but this is only 170 ppi pixel density. I test it using the same movie, playing it at the same time with this tablet and the phone, you can tell immediately that the phone display a much clearer, sharper and vivid colour of the movie. So i know it's not the quality of the movie itself but the tablet. If i had known, i probably would have save more and get other tablet later.\n\nI just read on Kindle Fire 7 spec and this tablet, the inches and display resolution are the same, with the difference of extra 1 more for the ppi but the price for Kindle Fire 7 is way much sweeter with a microSD card for up to 128 GB of additional storage, this tablet is only able to store up to 32GB. As I am only using it for movie and maybe some magazine read too, this is really not that good. Still, it serve its purpose well and I did use this to see movies many times and only recently it start to hang on me and if it die out on me someday, I would probably replace it with something that has the similar ppi to my mobile phone for my magazine fix. Other than that, I start to find 7 inch might not be enough for me to watch movies but I think I rather hdmi out to my tv rather than getting a too big tablet, it can be tiring to hold on to it while watching movie after awhile.\n\nStill it was a 'not too bad buy' for me at that time but as technology always improve with time, there are probably other better tablet or same tablet out there at a much better price you could get rather than this so I don't really recommend and i find that with Samsung the longer you use their product, it tends to hang...the mobile phone and this tablet are brought in 2012 and i'm still using it as i don't replace item unnecessarily but looks like i might have to soon."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Overview:  I bought this Tablet for my wife and after a couple of months, she quit using it and just went back to using her Samsung Galaxy S5 phone for everything because it does everything this tablet will do with the only downside being that it is smaller.\n\nPros:\n  Battery lasts for about 4-5 hours of video and/or 7-8 hours constant internet use.\n  Galaxy Tab 2 includes both a front and rear-facing camera.\n  It is very well built.  So Tablets I have used in the past seemed very fragile, but this one feels very solid & has been dropped often with no damage ( I did use a good after-market screen protector).\n  Has a larger screen than a smart phone.\n  It will synced up with your Google account so you can bring over the same app's you use on your other devices & your contacts.\n\nCons:\n  Really does not do anything your smart phone can't do and actually does less as it won't make calls.\n  Has a proprietary charging cord.  would prefer a micro USB or some other universal cord.  If it breaks it will cost you much more to replace.\n  Does not have HDMI video out capability\n  No Flash for camera, takes good pictures but only if you have good light to work with.\n  Even with the microSD port you are still very limited on storage (App's can only be saved on device not on SD card).\n\nFinal Analysis:  If you are in the market for a tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is a great choice but truthfully if you own a good smart phone and a good laptop... There really isn't much point to a tablet.  They do less than either and have less storage space and are the hardware is not upgradeable so they will be obsolete every few years (much like your smart phone).  But they are great for entertaining young children and keeping them away from the devices that you really care about.\n\nFinal Note:  I don't get paid to review products and bought this device with my personal finances.  I hope this review is helpful and would be glad to answer any questions regarding my experience with this or any other produces I have purchased on Amazon."}

I use the boat browser and can open many pages like a desk top computer. The only thing after 2 years in Sept of 2014 it was taking a long time to charge.\nI ordered a replacement battery on line and my friend who fixes cell phones opened it up and put the new battery in. It worked like new right after that holding an 7 hour charge like it was when it was brand new. I watch showes from the ABC Watch App and from Netflex and youtube. The colors are super sharp and clear. I now have chromecast that works awesome to stream from the tablet to my big HDTV. The price was awesome as well. Love this tablet so much I'm on it at least 4 to 6  hours a day checking email reading the news and so many other things over the internet. I have a great desk top computer but seem to go on it many 1 or 2 times a week now that I have this great performing tablet. I always think if it broke or I dropped it I would be upset. But I know I go right out and buy another 7\" tablet by Samsung. Price and performance seems so much better then my partners ipad. Plus this has a usb port to plug in my flash drive! If you want an awesome performing tablet go with Samsung!"}

Screen went totally black and no amount of charging or switching outlets etc. made a difference. Worked one day, nothing at all the next. No chance to retrieve any of my info and lost all my purchased apps. Very very maddening. Apparently this is common among these Samsung Galaxy Tablets. I'm convinced now that Apple products are the only way to go.  I had high hopes based on initial reviews but am left disappointed. Worthless in such a short time is unacceptable!!!  I will remember this before I ever purchase another Samsung product again. I used to really think highly of the brand. Now I fear buying junk even with good reviews. If customer service was excellent I may forgive a bad product. But with such terrible customer service on top of a dud product my time and money are going elsewhere in the future. Think twice before you buy from Samsung."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I've had the Tab for a year and a half.  It is handy for downloading music and Kindle books.  I also purchased 7 or 8 art books of artists I admire for a very low price from Amazon, and downloaded the images to my Tab for eye candy and inspiration.  I use the alarm function quite a bit, especially when I travel, and it is easy to choose either rings/tones or music from your downloaded music to wake up to in the morning.  The only drawback is that if the battery ever runs down to zero the Tab refuses to charge correctly.  At first I thought the Tab was trashed, but after searching the internet for solutions, I found that I had to pry the back off and disconnect the battery cable to cause a reset.  It wasn't pretty and I caused some cosmetic damage, but the Tab is back to perfect again.  So beware of the battery issue."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I think the Tab 2 is a fairly useless product. I owned a 7\" Tab 2 for 3 years and found it wasn't capable enough to do work, and wasn't fast/usable enough to use video chat or Facebook, and wasn't big enough to enjoy a Netflix movie.\n\nI disliked the quick accelerometer (unless turned off, the display flipped from horizontal to vertical with just slight moves), disliked the version of Android it ships with, disliked the stock keyboard and several other keyboards I tried, disliked the sound quality, and disliked the look/feel of the screen and metallic case.  The brightness/contrast levels of the screen annoyed me.  In particular the display gave me a headache.\n\nIn contrast, in 2015, I find the iPad Air to be a very capable device for most purposes (kind of like a Swiss Army knife), I think the Surface with TouchPad is a perfect reader and laptop substitute, and either the iPhone 6 or the modern Android phones can do anything that a 7\" tablet can do.\n\nSamsung missed the mark with the Tab 2 and I was mostly disappointed.  I did like three things about it:\n(1) long battery life that did not fade throughout a long period of ownership,\n(2) a screen that seemed durable and did not crack (although the side frame did chip several times),\n(3) a super-loud, easy to adjust alarm clock (which is all I ended up using the Tab 2 for, and why I kept it around after spending a year trying unsuccessfully to use it for more.)\n\nIt might be okay for a kid, or for someone who just uses it for games or entertainment.  That user is not me.  For the price, you can do better.  I'm surprised that used versions are still selling at this price point."}

It is starting to show it's age now, as it periodically freezes when using apps like Netflix and will have to let the battery drain to restart it. Also the storage has always been it's Kryptonite, as it has alot of bloatware that can't be moved. And even with a sd card it doesn't matter as not all app can be moved. I think that this is a good starter tablet for a preteen who is new to the tablet world."}

It has been dropped, got wet in a drenching rain, dropped in snow and is still giving me good service. Just wish it had phone capabilities. It is fast and the 32GB micro SD has given me enough space to keep on going. Used this gadget to view You Tube, movies etc. Got front and rear camera with good resolution. The print screen disappeared after an upgrade. However it can still be used by using a combination of steps. Do not know why Samsung decided to make the print screen disappear with just one click after a software upgrade."}

You have to get a case for it because otherwise it is slick and hard to hold. today is October 26, 2014 and it just all of a sudden quit working. I have tried 2 chargers, tried to reset it but nothing is working. It is completely dead so I am not happy that I have only had this for a little over a year and it no longer works.

Amazon recommended contacting the seller and I never heard anything back from them. I think that tab was a nice buy probably if I would have purchased new. So now I have a tab that I rarely ever touch. I use it for netflix when I have the patience to deal with all the complications it takes me to get the app up and running.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I am a laptop user for years so I finally bought a tablet. I chose the 7 -inch Samsung Galaxy 2 after reading reviews that seemed to indicate to me that Android was better than Apple. My sister has the Ipad. After using my tablet for a few months now, and witnessing my sister's use of her Ipad, I will say that neither device is without problems. My sister's Ipad screen freezes up and she needs to use the factory settings reset quite often. I had an Apple Itunes player that always froze on me and would stay in that state for hours. Apple seems to have this problem.  I think I made the best choice going with Android as it seems to be more convienient and allows more options where as the Ipad seems restricted to only Apple compatable options and downloads. I don't like to be held prisoner to using only Apple recognized applications and downloads. As stated, both devices have problems. I do not think the tablets are as well designed as the laptops. Tablets are much less vulnerable to virus attack, which has always been the main problem with laptops. This is good. Unfortunately, tablets are geered towards commercial companies charging fees to download and install their \"applications\" in order to do the same tasks that could be done for free with laptops. I believe that was one reason they created touch screen tablets, so that users would need to pay more. Laptop use was too \"free\".  Leave it to Microsoft, Apple and Samsung to come up with products that now charge user fees to do what \"obsolete\" laptops did for free. My Galaxy works well enough for email and Facebook. I'm having to get used to the touch screen as it is super sensative and I have fat fingers. It's easy to fumble when trying to type using the keyboard. Listening to music, my Galaxy lasts about 13-14 hours before needing recharging. I wonder how long before the battery wears out. The music player does not play my mp3 songs well. In the middle of songs, they sometimes \"skip\" which is a big disappointment. After reading up on possible fixes, I understand to correct this, one must download a better music player such as Winamp, as the standard player that comes with the Galaxy is flawed. Many other users have complained about this. Who wants to listen to their music skipping and cutting out in the middle of songs? The other problem I have found is with the movie player. It will not play Mp4 movies. You get half way through a movie and then a pop up appears that states the file cannot be played. It seems to play AVI and some other movie formats okay as long as they are short clips. I am still looking for a \"fix\" for this problem, although I'm afraid it will not be a free fix. Did they deliberatly design it with these flaws so I would need to pay to download programs that work properly? Again, tablets require downloading \"apps\" which cost money. Buy a tablet and get ripped off just to be able to keep using it? Otherwise, I am using it only for email and Facebook and not downloading any \"apps\" if I can help it because they all want my credit card. I guess I  expected any new device to work as well as a laptop and be as free to use as a laptop is. I'm not finding this to be the case with tablets.  I'm being generous giving it 3 stars. Hope these tablets improve."}

I really liked the amount of apps we could install on it and the kids enjoy the cameras. It is a very sturdy tablet that has held up to an autistic child and his little brother. Be sure to buy the extended warranty, its worth the cost in my opinion. I really appreciated that this tablet didn't come loaded with a bunch of useless junk or free trials that would entice the kids. We loaded the apps we wanted for the kids and put a password on everything else and the kids see only what we want. You can lock kids out of the internet, from in game purchases, and pretty much anything else.\nWe looked into a bunch of other tablets like the Nabi and we found that this tablet was less geared toward getting parents to subscribe to a bunch of stuff or having to buy a bunch of pre-installed junk. The Nabi limits what you can remove and the Samsung lets you get rid of anything you like. You can download anything you like from the Playstore and is wicked fast and has a nice size processor."}

(I decided to go with the Tab 2 after chatting online with Samsung about the speakers. The agent was very non-committal on how well the new speakers compared.)\n\nI like the speakers on the Tab 2. It has two end-fire speakers that can be heard from across the room. The speakers radiate out from the edge of the device, so it can sit flat on the table (in the case). It's not high fidelity, but it's loud and intelligible.\n\nIf you're not interested in speaker performance, you're probably better off with the newer model, but the new models have a single speaker on the back of the device.\n\nNote that the Tab 2 won't fit into the custom cases made for the 3s and 4s.

I got it to replace my Galaxy Tab GT-P1000, which I used all the time, but the hard drive went bad and I had to retire it.\n\nI do not like this one as well - mostly because apps will not store to external storage. Even if you get an app that says it moves your app to \"SD card\", it's a second partition of the device storage, so the external SD card.  I also tried cutting app data and moving it to the external SD card - but the moment I accessed the app it moved right back to the internal storage, along with all its data.  This is a huge deal for me, and not a problem I experienced with my original Tab. I would skip this tablet unless you get one with a larger internal memory to avoid the \"storage space running low\" message."}

I personally prefer a computer if I'm going to use the tablet for something other that FB or possibly reading. I haven't tried reading a book on it but would like to.

I bought a ultra slim case cover for my Galaxy Tab 2, which I can literally put in my pants pockets, just need to take it out when I sit.  My flipphone is much smaller than my Tab 2, but somehow found a way to carry both.

The Best Buy sales guy sold me on all the bells and whistles the tablet offered - Better, faster, the memory card slot and the great sale price. I should have stuck with a Kindle.\n\nIn August, shortly after my purchase, the Galaxy Tab2 would not charge. After being plugged in it would go through a cycle like it was charging however the tablet would not actually take or hold a charge. Then it would not turn on. The lights on the display appeared to try and charge but the Galaxy Tab2 would blink off and not actually charge. I sent the tablet in for service. In October and December it went in a second and third time. For the same issue.\n\nIn January 2014, a week after my tablet was returned, the same charging issue happened. I was angry and frustrated and finally spoke with the executive customer service team and was issued a new tablet. Sadly the replacement tablet they sent is not what I purchased. It is the \"newer\" model, presumably due to issues with the Tab2. The newer models are smaller and come in limited colors. I did not want the color Samsung sent, nor did I want a smaller device. I actually preferred the size of the Kindle Fire tablets.\n\nThe real deal-killer for me is that not only was the Tab2 in for service for more time than I actually had use of it, but when Samsung issued a replacement, it took nearly 6 weeks to arrive.\n\nNext time I will stick with the Kindle Fire. Amazon has exceptional customer service. When I had under-warranty issues, I always received friendly, helpful Amazon staff and received a replacement product within 2-3 days - Tops! The bonus card slot for the Samsung Galaxy Tab just isn't worth the issues I had with the tablet, or Samsung's lengthy replacement process. Now my case and screen guards are too large and I have a device I no longer want."}

So I found myself without a tablet and not enough money to afford a new iPad.  These Samsung tablets were very inexpensive and highly rated, so I thought I would delve into the Android world by trying one.\n\nI love the size - 7 inches is perfect for a tablet, in my view.  iPads are too big.\n\nThe operating system is fine; I enjoy how flexible and configurable Android is.  There are a few things it does clearly better than iOS.  App selection seems to be fine, although there is a weird thing going on with Amazon Prime Instant Video that probably relates to the Kindle.\n\nAs a music player, this device sounds very good - much better than any iPod or iPhone I have tried.  Not many people mention that.\n\nBut - the hardware is terrible.  It is so bad that it profoundly affects how I use this device.\n\nThe touchscreen is inaccurate.  I find myself pecking around trying to get the thing to recognize what I am trying to touch.  Often, I mistakenly touch whatever is next to what I aim for, sending me on an unplanned journey.\n\nThe device is S  L  O  W - slow to respond to keyboard input, slow to render web pages, slow to run applications.  Lots of latency in everything.\n\nThe device lacks adequate processing power to run a video application and send its sound to a connected bluetooth device at the same time.  It can do one or the other, but not both without skipping and freezing.\n\nI used to use Evernote on my iPad as a notetaking device in meetings and at conferences.  Evernote is available on Android, but using it on this device is a non-starter because of the latency and keyboard response problems.\n\nI think this may have been a nice device when it was released; perhaps the OS and apps we are running in 2013 and 2014 are handing it more than it was designed to accommodate.  Whatever the reason though, I cannot recommend this tablet at any price.\n\n2/1/2014 UPDATE: At someone's suggestion, I completely reset the device, wiped all apps and data from it, and returned it to its factory condition.  I have noticed some performance improvement - possibly 15% to 20%.  At its current level of performance, I improve my review of the tablet by one star and admit that it is a price-acceptable tablet if not exactly a stellar performer."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I have had this tablet for about 2 months now and it has been a decent product thus far. I have played around with tablet models from various manufacturers, but decided on this one for the fact I am most familiar with Samsung Android products; it was a fairly seamless process going from my Galaxy S2 phone to this tablet. That being said, it does have some quirks that my phone doesnt seem to have. Every once in a while when I am surfing the web it will say connectivity issues and go back to the home screen. I am only about 10 feet from my wireless router, so I am not sure why that is as my phone never does this. It is also rather slow. I maybe assumed too much, but I figured the larger machine would have a faster operating system and thus browse faster than my phone. This maybe just a browser issue and switching to something like Firefox for Android may help a bit; something I will most likely try. With the negatives out of the way this device does have some good points. The price probably tops that list. The new models coming out keep driving the price of this unit down and it is on sale quite often. Although the screen doesnt have the pixels of the new models, it is nice and bright and good enough for what I am using it for; certainly larger than what I am used to with my phone. If you watched a lot of movies you may want to get a newer model more tailored to that application. All in all, price point considered, I am satisfied with the purchase. I think it is probably one of the better starter type tablets out there and gives me an ideas for upgrades I may want in a future purchase."}

The camera is pretty decent, not great but good enough, as good as my Samsung galaxy Siii.\n\nI find the speed is just fine for videos, audio, browsing folders.  Screen resolution is good enough to use for portfolio work.\n\nOnly issue I'd bring up on this is that after 15 mo, the battery  seemed to not charge as well. I got 75% battery readings on the meter after it sits with no wifi on, in only 9 hours overnight. This happened several times--I tested to make sure.  I tried running the battery down to 15% before recharging to condition the battery (although I don't know if it says this works in the manual)  this seems to have fixed the problem.  Now I still get 80% battery with quick wifi use (checking messages) and a couple hours of mp3 playing."}

I understand that you can even download apps that allow you to talk to others as though it were a phone, some including video. The clarity of the screen is excellent.

I've seen some other 7 inch tablets and the video is not nearly as good and those with less memory sometimes crash when you try to run some of the apps. Samsung rocks!"}

It was glitchy and the apps didn't work as well.  As the updates for Android progressed everything kept working better and better though and considering the price I felt like I got a good deal.  The initial reviewers that proclaimed this as good as an iPad were either lying or just had never tried an iPad, but with all the updates to Android and the price of this tablet it is a good one.  I think there are better choices now, but if the price is low enough you get a lot for the money."}

And in comparison to the Kindle Fire that my friend has, its screen lighting is much more powerful. You can turn up the screen so you can easily read in the sun (which I love doing- beach, by the pool, or just on the go outdoors).

If you can find one of these little gems, snatch it up quickly - there's a reason Apple took Samsung to court to keep them from selling these - even at well over two years old, they still offer the current competition a real run for their money.\n\nMy only complaint is the propriety charging connector, with no direct USB cable. ranted, you can buy adapters for OTA USB drive connections, and even HDMI, but these require a separate purchase, and the HDMI adapter at $35+ USD is not cheap."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I've been helping my little nephew to use and maintain his galaxy tab 2 for over a year now, and I've generally been very happy with how things have gone. The skin Samsung designed for their version of Android isn't my favorite, but that's just personal taste and not really any specific problem. Anyway, it's been easy enough to use that a kid is getting along with it fine, so that's certainly a good sign.\n\nI'm also giving them credit for the fact that he's not always gentle with his stuff and not always good about being careful with what he tries to install, and the little tablet is still chugging along doing its job without hardly any issues or complaints in more than a year. He uses it as a place to play games, a way to send messages to family members, a means to watch movies when we're sick of hearing the same movie for the 5th time and we don't want it on the television, and occasionally a place where he reads electronics books from online stores or our region's library.\n\nIt has 8GB of storage space, which may be a little tight for some people. On the other hand, you can add a lot more space as needed using SD cards.\n\nOn the whole, I wouldn't say this is necessarily the very best that Android tablets have to offer, but I certainly can't argue with how well ours has held up and done its job. It's still running well enough and running recent enough versions that (barring mishaps) I wouldn't be terribly surprised if we manage to get another year of useful life out of it. With the Tab 3 being around, the Tab 2 is down to price levels that make it a really good buy as something that's good enough to be useful, but affordable enough that you don't have to be so afraid it might break that you hesitate to carry it around and actually use it."}

Battery life is very good and can be used for about 4 hours on average use. Sound quality and picture both are awesome. Image quality is definitely not better than that of ratina ones, however its still comparable with the kind of low price it has. Its'very well built as well. My daughter dropped it few times and it didn't break nor did any of its functions got affected. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a solid mini tab with excellent performance in half the price of Apple's.\n\nCons: Didnt find any."}

I can't even send a letter across my 'po-dump town' that fast. I plan on doing repeat business with Jim as soon as I get some spare change to purchase another gadget. With his prices, customer service support, & extremely fast shipping, there is no purpose to even browse a different seller.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I bought this a little over a year ago.  I bought a 32 GB microSD card to go with it.  About 11 months after I bought both the card and the tablet, the tablet basically destroyed the card.  All I attempted to do was move files from the internal memory to the external card, and it became hopelessly corrupt.  I flushed the stupid card down the toilet (and filmed myself doing so), I was so angry.  I should have tossed the damn tablet into the garbage.\n\nInstead, I bought another microSD card.  32 GB, this time a PNY card.  Well, last night Samsung issued an update to the OS.  I just ignored it (BIG MISTAKE) and let it do it's thing, because it was late and I had to go to work early in the morning.\n\nI come home and turn on the wretched tablet, and what do I find?  That some apps had been installed onto the SD card, even though I NEVER install apps onto the SD card!  How do I know this?  Three apps had a funny icon instead of the usual icon, indicating that it had been installed onto an SD card, but could no longer be accessed because the SD card was no longer being detected by this stupid pile of uselessness.\n\nThe microSD card had once again been completely and utterly destroyed by this stupid worthless tablet.  I put it in my Macbook Pro - wouldn't mount.  I put it in some old Sansa mp3 player I had lying around.  Wouldn't mount.  I even put it in my old Dell laptop running Linux Mint Olivia and it still would not mount.  AT ALL.\n\nThis is the second card this stupid wretched tablet has destroyed.  I am not wasting any more money on it.  Fortunately, I didn't have anything terribly important on it that hadn't been backed up somewhere else.  I am warning others though - do not buy this tablet if you intend to use it for something important, unless you're willing to live without an SD card.  I am certain it will just completely and utterly destroy whatever card you put in it.  It's only a matter of time.\n\nAll other benefits of the tablet do not outweigh this one major problem.  This thing is a POS.  At least Apple had the good enough sense to realize that slapping an SD card slot onto their devices would only cause problems.  Even Google knows that, which is why their Nexus tablets do not have SD card slots.\n\nAvoid any tablet or smartphone that runs Android and comes with a SD card slot, as they're nothing but trouble.  I am so angry right now.  I'm tempted to pitch the stupid thing straight out the window."}

It ran slower than my great grandma, and she's dead. Half the apps I tried on it would crash constantly, and after about 2 months, the only thing I ever used it for was a remote for my TV. And now it can't even do that--only a year after purchasing it, my tablet no longer works. It could be the charger, but I really don't care enough about this terrible piece of technology to spend any money on a new cord. Speaking of which, they should have opted for a micro usb charger, rather than the Apple charger knockoff. If your charger goes, you only have one choice: buy a new one from Samsung. Basically all of my other devices have a micro usb. There's no need for this special charger nonsense."}

First, the charger for this tablet is unique to the tablet so you cannot use any of the hundred other chargers you've got around the house. Second, after about 6 months the cord started to pull out of the end of the charger that plugs into the tablet so that the bare wires inside are showing. I've had and used other chargers for years and never had this problem. And finally, the charging cord is a USB cord so that it can be plugged into your computer as well as being used to charge. While this sounds convenient, you cannot plug the cord into any other wall plug adaptor except the original Samsung or your tablet will not charge properly.  The replacement charger from Samsung costs $50 which is 1/4 of the price of the entire tablet...this seems ridiculous to me.  Love this tablet but wish Samsung had put as much thought into the charger as they did the actual technology."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "The Galaxy Tab 2 is an okay tablet and I would likely think more highly of it if I could do a large portion of the tasks with it that I bought a tablet for.\n\nI ended up getting the Tab 2 7.0 almost sight unseen when they were being discounted in the wake of the Tab 3 coming out and what I saved in that initial purchase price will likely be lost in functionality and features.\n\nWhile the Tab 2 is fine enough when it comes to the average Android experience, using it for internet and reading purposes, the decision by Samsung to release with a proprietary connector for charging results its ease of use throughout different environments more difficult.  Unlike the similarly proprietary design of the various Apple connectors, the Samsung variation on the theme is nowhere near as available at a moments notice.  Losing a cable means being required to order online.\n\nFinally, the tablet's inaccuracy on the touchscreen with the use of a stylus renders it completely useless for such tasks.  If you have any desire to use the tablet with a number of drawing apps with a stylus, the results are so horrible as to be frustrating and disheartening for someone who wants an affordable, portable digital sketchpad.  Even using a stylus with routine, non-detailed work is sometimes an exercise in futility.\n\nNo stylus performs well on this tablet that I can find, producing mostly jagged, broken, undesired and unnatural results.  Oddly enough, a quick test of a Galaxy Tab 3 and a few other, now-comparably-priced, tabs seem to show a much greater degree of sensitivity and accuracy with a stylus.  It's possible that this is a combination of a hardware/software issue that Samsung might release an update or an app for to rectify, but with the Tab 3 already out and the relative lack of support they appear to have already given the Tab 2, I doubt it.\n\nIn the end, the flaws of the Galaxy Tab 2, for me, outweigh its features, and will likely cause me to move on to another tablet that much sooner, which is a shame because I probably accept and live with the proprietary power connectors if the stylus controls were as good as my fingertip control."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Great little tablet. that I have had for 11 months that is easy to use, great display, the sound quality is good.  It syncs with my Bluetooth devices easily and has taken the pounding of my one year old who bangs on the baby phone app pretty hard a couple of times a week now for 6 months.  I use the tablet to read books watch movies, share photos on dropbox, play games, and I use the Polaris office suite on occasion.  It was easy to set up on my wifi and streams content just as well as my laptop.  I can also share files with other Samsung devices via the all share which is kind of nice.  Now for the issues that I have with it.  It has the peel remote control which I believe to be a Samsung app that was great at first letting me select shows based on the picture etc.  Now I really only use it for the channel up and channel down because some of the other features no longer work after an update that Samsung pushed.  The other issue is no HDMI output.  The allshare allows me to share what is on my micro sd card but that is it.  It will not allow me to share Netflix, dropbox, internet searches etc.  that would be nice on occasion when you are looking to play a movie for 4 nephews or are looking for something to watch in your hotel room after your son goes to sleep.  Both issues are relatively minor to an otherwise great device."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Although I've been mucking around on a computer for many years now, this was my first venture into the tablet venue. I wasn't really sure what to buy. Do I go all out, buy a larger one with all the bells & whistles for the price of a base model laptop? Or do I stick with something simple & inexpensive?\n\nI decided to go with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. The price was a definite consideration, I liked that it was under $200. I preferred to stick with name brand, as I've had too many friends who went with an inexpensive brand that broke within a few months. The size seemed sufficient for me to play some of the fun apps & keep notes for school.\n\nIt's been around 6 months since I first bought the tablet, and I'm overall pleased with it. I do wish it had two things. More storage, because the OS takes up a great deal of space. In hindsight, I would have paid more to have 16GB rather than 8. Also, I wish the charging port was a micro USB instead of 30 pin data port. My husband's Samsung Note has the micro USB and so does my daughter's Nexus 7. It would be really nice to be able to use other charging cords like they do (my husband can use his phone charger) than having to make sure I don't EVER misplace this one.\n\nBut for a simple tablet from a trusted brand, I do think the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is a good choice."}

Be a lightweight-easy-to-carry substitute for my fabulous little Asus netbook. And I bought a case that comes with a blue tooth keyboard (IVSO... very satisfied with that). So I could do online paperwork for my job and word processing on the commuter rail.. in a park.. etc.\n\nThis was the biggest disapointment: I soon discovered that tablet software and computer software are neither compatible nor easy to transfer between. The online system i work with for my job is impossible to use on this tablet: cannot book appointments in the proper slot on the calender.. cannot write daily notes without constant software generated errors...\n\n2. To be a way to watch Amazon streaming videos that come free with my AMazon Prime... my bad.. these don't work with this tablet.. now saving my pennies for the new Kindle Fire..\n\n3. To watch other streaming videos from the internet. This did not work because my internet connection.. 4G was not adequate.. either could not get videos going at all or had constant delays with buffering\n\nSo.. yesterday I finally switched to the fastest intenet service RCN provides (billed to be able to run games and video for several devices at the same time)... The Gaiam TV video I have been longing to see.. (and that runs fine with the RCN service on my netbook) will not even open on the tablet. ...\n\nso now  pretty much everything I got this tablet for bombed.. and .. as I said.. I am saving pennies for an Amazon Fire HDX..."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Bought here on Amazon a few months ago.\n\nThe good:\nThis tablet continues to run great. I have it loaded with apps it runs with no problem, and have yet to find a good app it cannot run. If I let it sit and just use it to answer calls, texts, and email, with the occasional surf on the web, I get a whole day on one charge, and then some. If I get going on a game, or playing music steadily, a charge lasts me about 5 hours. The screen is plenty clear enough for me, and although I stuck in an old 32 gig card I had laying around, you could probably get by just fine for most tasks with the onboard 8 gigs, or maybe a 16 gig card would be ideal costwise. Wifi connections are strong, and it takes a beating from a toddler pretty good on occasion. I find the cameras adequate for my needs.\n\nThe bad:\nThis tablet has power problems. It thinks it is charging when it is not, and vice-versa. When hooked to my PC through the USB cord/AC adapter, it connects and disconnets itself randomly. Jiggling the cable sometimes has effect, sometimes doesn't. The problem is in the power connection, where you input the AC adapter plug into the tablet. This was found out after buying a separate cord.\n\nSummary\nSamsung customer support was my resort because my Amazon refund time has passed. I received a very nice email within hours of my email to them, asking me to send them the machine for service. Apparently this power problem is documented online in several places and Samsung is aware of the problem. Since my machine is running fine otherwise, and it is accepting a charge intermittently, I am going to keep it rather than send it in for repair, which could take some time. I think this could be a manufacturing defect.\n\nMy suggestion would be to solve this problem which arises for too many devices of this type. Lots of work and ingenuity goes into the machine, but comparatively little into the powering of it. From laptops on, this has been a problem, and it seems to be getting worse with newer devices. The best machine isn't worth much if it can't get power, or register that power correctly."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Device has two problems that keep it from being a five star.\n\nFirst Problem:  The SD card is only given limited function in Samsungs version of Android.  Only a very few apps can even find it.  Samsung includes an \"SD card (emulated)\" directory that most apps will find and save things to, but that's really on your internal 8GB of memory.  Only a few File Manager apps can find the actual card and move stuff there.  This includes most movie, music and graphics viewing apps.  The only apparent reason for this is to bring on the date where the eight GB internal memory becomes limiting and force you to upgrade sooner. (new $200 tablet instead of a new $20 SD card)  I can't imagine any other benefit to Samsung for limiting the usefulness of their product in this fashion.\n\nSecond Problem: The digitizer can't be used to draw with a stylus in art programs or for handwriting entry.  It gives wavy lines when drawing diagonally.  This includes sketching (drawing lightly back and forth).  In other tablets this doesn't happen, including the little $56 7inch things the local radio shack sells.  Tried this with 6 different styluses at a local store with a VERY understanding manager.  All the same.  Tried it with several different note taking and art apps.  Samo Samo. Go to customer supplied images for this product and click \"all images\"  I've uploaded the one that looks like just a bunch of Black, Red, Green, Blue and Yellow lines.  All the lines drawn should be straight and smooth like the black ones.  If you draw horizontally or vertically with a stylus the line comes out all wavy like the red and yellow lines, unless you draw the line really fast (not always practical).  There are comments about this on the web in various user forums, but none on any of the professional reviews for this product or on Samsung's own forum for this product (suspicious?).\n\nIF you're sure you're not going to do anything that requires a stylus, art or note taking mainly.  AND you're sure that eight GB will be enough until you're wlling to buy something bigger.  THEN this is an Ok tablet at an excellent price.  Otherwise, move along, move along.  Find something else."}

I would have given the tablet a 10, excellent, but Amazon did not stand behind their A-Z guarantee for a return.  Having to purchase a monthly service plan with Verizon turned out to be much more than I could afford - I returned the tablet after 2 weeks with all the packaging material, paid for postage - they tried to say I did not until I let them know I still have the receipt, did all that was required.  I gently hi-lited a few specific instructions in the 3X4\" booklet so my eyes would go right to them when I referred back, they charged me $80.00 for the return.  They are trying to say I did not return with all the packaging material which is totally untrue.  The company was \"DataVision\", out of Long Island City, New York.

The screen resolution is pretty bad if you ask me.\n\nI would also like to say that the tablet is pretty laggy and takes a while when tapping on the on screen keyboard, you can get about 6 letters in before it catches up and i only have about 5 apps downloaded on this thing.\n\nGoing from my phone or computer to the tablet, I feel like I'm looking at one of those old tube TV's where you can see all the dots in the screen... You can really see the edge lit lighting shinning on the front side of the lcd as well.\n\nI guess its good enough for my 2 year old but its not something I enjoy at all."}

As well as, I personally know someone who said that this tab was working well with them. It has been 4 months since my purchase and lately I am having a terrible time with this tab. The tablet itself, at times, is very hot to the touch (even when not being charged). The screen was not responding neither was the tab charging. When I eventually restarted it, and got it to charge, there was a red X and the white lightning bolt at the charging icon. A day later, the screen is black and the tab won't turn on. Today, I've read more reviews and I am noticing a trend where persons who used their tabs for 3-4 months, are having similar problems. And the worst part is that there's no recourse at this point. This is not good at all. I was thinking about buying a Samsung phone but, after this experience, I will have to consider another brand."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I tried both and would recommend the Kindle HD over Samsung Tab 2.\nI ordered the regular Kindle HD 7\" and the display was super sharp for watching videos and sound was amazing for a small device. I also liked getting to access some free books from Amazon library, which is clever marketing and also have Amazon prime for their free videos.\nI also liked the HD compared to Samsung Tab 2 which did not have high def and the touch screen for Tab was less responsive. The Tab has less touch response than my Samsung smart phone. Flash video is also no longer supported for android so had to install manually from Adobe archive.\nThe main flaw of the Kindle was it was a bit too wide to hold with one palm since I have smaller hands. In addition, the frame was also too wide that took up more screen space.  The Tab is narrower in design and easier to hold.\nAnother disadvantage of Kindle is many of the Amazon apps are not free unlike for android. I like some of the features of the Tab; for instance I can also control Samsung TV and play videos from the tablet to the TV.\nI use tablets less than my smart phone because of limit wifi access; for instance like going out."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Let me start with a warning that I probably expect more, or at least different things, from a tablet that most buyers.  My primary reason for buying a tablet is to use it in my Jeep for off-road navigation, music and entertainment while otherwise off-the-grid.  So a key factor was great 4G performance.  As an AT&T customer for over 20 years, I've heard all the amazing claims about Verizon's network coverage.  So I went with Verizon this time and, frankly, I am far from impressed.\n\nFirst of all, Verizon's coverage appears to be no better than AT&T's, at least not in the NY/NJ/PA area that I frequent.  So much for the improved service.  Making matters worse is that Verizon charges more for the its monthly data plans than AT&T.  Finally, even when I have a solid 4G signal, the data throughput is absolutely abysmal.  This little experiment with Verizon has decidedly caused me to abandon any ideas of switching my family's phone service from AT&T.\n\nBut more important is that Samsung has done something strange with the headphone jack on this tablet.  Normally I can plug an auxiliary audio cable from the headphone jack to the aux input on my car stereo and have all the sound go through the Jeep's speakers.  This tablet acts as though nothing is plugged-in; all sound continues to go through the internal speaker.  I contacted Samsung support and they could offer no insight or solution.  Thinking this was possibly a defective unit I returned it, and the replacement behaved the same way.  Odd, because we have a wifi-only SGS Tab 2 7\" that did not have this problem, nor does my SGS 3 phone.\n\nThe other odd thing on this (and all other Samsung tablets prior to version 3) is the proprietary sync connector.  While the rest of the world (except Apple, no surprise) has adopted the micro-USB port as a standard, this tablet still uses a proprietary connector.  Not a huge deal, because you can buy extras for around $9 each.  Unless you forget to bring your cable on a trip and can't find anyone else with a Samsung tablet, and then you can't charge your tablet.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the only 4G Android tablet on the market has such fatal flaws (at least for me).  At this point I'm probably going to give the Tab 2 7.0 to my daughter and buy an Acer tablet and get a MiFi hotspot to use 4G.  I hate to have to carry yet another device, but unless someone steps up with an alternative (that is not a $700 iPad) I see no other options."}

I seriously couldn't BELIEVE that the built-in mic on the tablet sounded THAT GOOD, but it did! Crazy good! The video quality is top notch, too! Samsung didn't skimp on microphone quality one bit, and that's a relief. The front and back cameras make it a great option when we're long distance and do \"date nights\" when one of us is out at a small concert or out at the beach. I tether my phone as a 3G/4G wifi hotspot, since our tablets are wifi only. I've never come across any wifi or bluetooth issues with this tablet either, fyi...and I've had it for several months now.\n\nLastly, if you want a recommendation on a great, protective case that doesn't add bulk or a ton of weight... go to this eBay seller's page:\n\n[...]\n\n(don't worry, this is a clean link with no viruses attached) It fits PERFECTLY, the IR window and all of the ports and buttons are exposed.

I regret it. I've had the tablet for 2 months and it freezes at least once a day. The camera crashes all the time. Putting music onto the tablet (my music is all in iTunes) is a PAIN. I ended up having to buy a memory card to put my music on. I was told that this is the best choice for what I was wanting...perhaps I should want something different is what I'm now thinking. I've debated going back to Apple multiple times in the last month. I like the fact that there is a slot for a micro SD card however because then I can put my music on it rather than take up space on the tablet. I personally wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but it was recommended to me.\n\nUPDATE 2/22/14:\n\nAs someone who has had 2 different iPod touches but no smartphone, I thought I'd be ok with this Android product. There are many games that the Google Play store does not offer that I have heard about and would like to try. Because of this, I am upgraded my phone to an iPhone5s and am going to be selling this Android product to someone who has the patience for it. Software is up to date and the camera still crashes, the device deleted apps, the battery life is getting awful, and the tablet itself is starting to come apart.

I bought a 16gb microSD for this, and I can add a bunch of videos and music onto it. You can't really do that with a Kindle device. (At least I don't think you can.) I like how small and light it feels. I mainly take it to campus with me and goof around with it when I'm not in class, so the size is really convenient for me.\n\nI don't really care for some of the pre-installed apps on this though.

I ordered this Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 on a Sunday and it actually arrived at my house on Monday!!  This can only be described as phenominal!  The product itself is excellent!  This is the second Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 we now have in our house.  This one I bought for my wife for her birthday!  I've had mine for close to 2 years now and love it!  I feel this is one of the best tablets on the market.  With this tablet you have a dual front and rear facing camera and a micro SD memory card slot that will support up to a 32GB cards.  This is great since all I need to do is copy all my favorite video's to the cards and this will play them.  There are plenty of video playing apps that will play almost any video format on this device so it's very versitile when it comes to file type. I have a small case that I keep my micro SD cards in and carry them with the tablet so I can watch watever I want whenever I want. I would recommend this tablet to anyone is looking for a 7\" tablet.  I also own a Kindle Fire HD and the quality of the video definitly stands up to this device.  In fact the only reason I own the Kindle Fire HD is because you need a Kindle device to egt all the perks of being an Amazon Prime Member.  i.e. free book to borrow each month as well as it's nice for streaming the free movies from Amazon Prime Movies.

Being new to tablets, I thought I would be lost but through working with it a little, it's easy to pick up on how to work it. I have watched a few things on it and the video/audio quality is superb. I like the whistle sound it makes when you get an email. I love the look of it and the size. It's not too big for me to hold but it's also not too small to enjoy the viewing experience. Crashing on anything so far is rare. I love everything about it pretty much."}

Two, it has a memory slot to hold a 32 gb micro sd card without being charged a extra 100 to 200 dollars, unlike some company's that rhymes with the word snapple. Three, the battery can be replaced without having to use a heat gun."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "When I decided I wanted to get a tablet I originally planned on getting an iPad. I thought at the time that that was really one of the only good quality tablets out there. One day I decided to do a little research and found this tablet on here. I had no idea that Samsung sold tablets. After reading about the specs and reading reviews I decided to get this instead of an iPad. I figured that even though it wasn't the 'superior' iPad I still wanted to get this to save money. I must say that I made the best choice picking this device. It isn't as simple as the iPad is. You can do more customization with your pages so that it can be your personal page. It doesn't have to in such a concrete setting like Apple products uses. Another little plus with the home screens is that you can even get animated backgrounds to add more flair to your device. I must say that it really does add a lot to a home page =) Another way this device is superior to the iPad is that you aren't set with just 8GB of memory. There is a SD slot that allows you to add more memory if you happen to run out. You're allowed to add up to 32GB of memory to your tablet which is considerably a good amount. One more major way it is superior to the iPad is the Command Center that you can easily access wherever you are on your tablet. You can adjust your settings for your tablet without having to exit out of whatever you are doing. It really does help when you don't have to consistently switch screens just to adjust your brightness.\n\nToday it seems like the smart choice for anyone to get an iPad, but that is a wrong thought. The smarter choice would be to buy this device. You could very well save hundreds of dollars when buying this tablet. I have yet to experience any big problems with it and it still works like it's brand new. I knew someone who was already having problems with their iPad after only having it for about 3 months. Save the trouble and the fear of your brand new device breaking by buying a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. You won't regret it ;)"}

It would only light up briefly showing the battery indicator filling about 1/4 of the way, then blackingout continously!  It would NOT POWER UP!  I was fuming....because my husband saw it the short time it worked & wanted one.  I saw it on HSN as TSV $169.95 and Easypay, so I got him one wished I would have waited & got me one too!.  Now mind you Amazon showed it was too late to return it as of Sept 29th!  So, now I'm faced with having to contact the manufacturer to have it repaired.  I wonder is this why these tablets are being sold so cheaply?  If so then  ( Shame). I tried another adapter, cable, wall socket & hard reset to No Avail!  I then googled my issue and soon saw a lot of complaints about powering up issues."}

When I got it, it was very easy to get it up and running. When I received this tablet is was running Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean. A few days later it upgraded to Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean and runs even better than it did before.\n\nAs for this video review, it is for the camera quality of the tablet, testing out the 3 MP (1280x720) 720p rear facing and the VGA (640x480) 480p front facing camera.\n\nPros:\n-It is very light yet sturdy.\n\n-Comes with everything you need to get it up and running. (i.e. cords, and manuals)\n\n-It has a very elegant design.\n\n-The curves on the side are very nice, they don't hurt your hands like some other tablets will.\n\n-7 inches may seem small, but it is very usable, with a 1024x600 screen resolution\n\n-The text is very clear and easy to read.\n\n-Pinch to Zoom works really well... All hand gestures work very well.\n\n-The IR blaster is very nice, it sends signals from over 30 feet away, so it can be used as a nice universal remote\n\n-Power/Volume buttons are very easy to press.\n\n-The Microphone quality is exceptional, as seen in the video review.\n\n-The two stereo speakers are very loud and clear.\n\n-The data port is very nice and secure (When plugged in).\n\n-32 GB of external storage is a nice plus, because you only get 4 of the 8 GB stock.\n\n-The Accelerometer is extremely accurate.\n\n-GPS is sort of accurate, will go into detail in the Cons.\n\n-The Battery Life is exceptional, they advertised 8 hours when in constant use, I played a CPU intensive game for four hours and the battery was only down to 85%, so if it were to sit idle with the screen on full blast, it would last a lot longer than 8 hours.\n\n-Voice recognition, I would give about a 97% success rate, there are times that it has a hard time putting what I say because of my Oregonian Accent; but it does alright.\n\n-Abundant source of app and widgets with Google Play\n\n-You can Synchronize just about any account with this tablet, whether it be Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Vine, YouTube, and of course Google.\n\n-This tablet also has a light sensor, but I don't use it so I really don't know how well it works.\n\nCons:\n-It is not an anti-glare screen, so reading outside is almost impossible; but it's not a deal-breaker.\n\n-Since the release of Android 4.1.1, they have taken the snapshot button away (that is a knock on Android, not Samsung) and now you have to hold down the power and volume down button to take a snapshot.\n\n-The GPS is not all the accurate when using offline map data and when using it when walking.\n-The virtual keyboard can be a bit finicky, but I have Paul Bunyan fingers.\n\nThese are the only Cons I can think of because I have only had the tablet for a week, but from a weeks use; I can tell that it is a very durable with a lot of battery life, this is defiantly a great tablet for anyone who wants one for a very in-expensive price, keep in mind that the tablet that I am doing this review on is a WI-FI only tablet. The 3G-4G tablet will probably work a little differently. I guess that I am at the end of this review. Would I recommend this to a friend? Yes I would, but I would say spend the extra $30 and get the newest model (Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0)\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-3-7-Inch-Gold-Brown/dp/B00D02AG7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 (7-Inch, Gold-Brown)</a>"}

Other than that, the battery lasts for a 4+ hour flight of watching video, the screen is plenty bright, and it's nice to be able to quickly look something up on a screen larger than my cell phone."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I chose a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7\", Wi-Fi) over a Kindle Fire HD, because the Tab 2 was only $10 more. That $10 got me the Android OS and all its support and upgrades. I use a PC for my main computer, so when I chose a smartphone, I went with an Android OS there as well. It is a Samsung Galaxy S3.\n\nI quickly downloaded my favorite Android apps that I use on my phone all the time, I signed into my Google accounts, and I immediately started using it. There was no learning curve.\n\nI bought my Tab 2 to replace my old standard Kindle. I love the Kindle. I love reading books on it, but I honestly can't tell you how many times I wanted to touch the screen to get a word definition or highlight a section or make a note. With the Kindle for Android app on the Tab 2, I can do all that and much more. It really is just as good as a paper book.\n\nWhile I bought it mainly to read books on, I found myself writing a report using Polaris Office in the first week. It proved very handy.\n\nI use apps that are for mundane, practical purposes and don't play games on my Tab 2. I also don't watch movies on it, but I will say that I like the quality of the screen resolution. It works for me just fine.\n\nI did listen to music for background ambiance, and though the sound had a lot of treble since it was turned down very low, it was adequate.\n\nI took a lot of time to study which tablet to buy and asked a lot of very knowledgeable friends. They all suggested I go with the Android OS. I am very happy with the Tab 2 and highly recommend it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "It's exactly what I wanted. I bought this instead of the new Google Nexus 7 (2013) because of the micro sd card slot, seamless Galaxy interface and pre-installed apps like Kindle and Netflix. It can be switched on and used instantly, and it's really easy to set up, with instructions on the home screen.\n\nBut if you, like me, bought this because you wanted to purchase Kindle titles out of US, Note that the Kindle installed is version 3.7.. (current version is 4.2.2)\nI couldn't view my Kindle bought magazine because my software wasn't updated. And I couldn't update my software because I was not allowed to because of my geographical location. The Astrill Open VPN didn't seem to work and apparently the interface was still telling Amazon I wasn't in US. Tough Luck. The Kindle app can't be deleted as well.\n\nSo I had to transfer the Kindle apk file from PC to my tablet and configure my settings to allow third party downloads.\n\nSo just a point to note, if you're not that techy, you might want to get some help with this."}

I've dropped it countless times [without a case nor a protector] and the screen hasn't cracked besides some cosmetic scratches I have on the back. [I try to lay it on a napkin or a magazine if I put it on a hard surface]\nAnd by sturdy it's hit the metal trash can then the tile floor, carpet in my room, wooden floor & a rug...\nMy friend got a different tablet [I think it was a 32gb nexus 7] and she already has a small crack on the corner of the plastic.\n\nHaven't seen any lag kind of stuff on it\n\nGreat for a techie kind of person or the normal reader that likes to surf the web.\n\nAlso has GPS which is a plus.\n\nNot bulky I can throw it into any of my bags and it will fit.\n\nI like the photo quality it takes personally.\n\n8+ hours just about.

I currently have about maybe 4.53 mb of space left.\n\nDependent on wifi is the only thing I'm unhappy about esp when I get lost in NYC or need directions somewhere or to get home from a place not familiar.\n\nThe power plug... I have to orient my tablet upside down cause I've already bent one of the power cords for it.\n\nThe only lag-ish thing is the stock internet crashes sometimes... Tho I think that's because I'm runnin too many apps.\n\nI find the speakers too loud... So I put the balance -100. I listen to my music low cause I have very good hearing.\n\nSpeaker position: HATE! Most of the time the speaker parts are layin on somethin that muffles the sound also why I have my tablet upside down.\n\nSpeaker popping noise sometimes & the sound gets stuck that I'm without any music for a while.\n\nNotifications go off sometimes when I when I have blockin mode on [which I hate]\n\nNo camera focus/apt\n\n2 email apps pre-installed\n\nThat All-Share thing I never got it to work nor the IR.\n\nThat new fangled system update... I hate it... I can't: edit on the fly anymore, see my notifications when using some apps, black bar on the bottom of all screencaps, miss the screenshot shortcut instead of this new side button pushing, blocking mode = worst thing ever give me back the old disable notifications.\n\nThat being said, I love it to bits and want to get another one this time w more internal storage."}

I wasn't even sure I would actually USE a tablet (freelance writer: work on laptop, movies on HDTV, Kindle 2 user, Ipod for MP3s) but thought it might be mildly entertaining.\n\nWow, do I ever use it.  Each and every day. Great for Netflix, Kindle books, web browsing, email, Audible audiobooks, Amazon Cloud Player MP3s, and TWITTER!\n\nI opted for the Samsung over a Kindle for a simple/stupid reason:  I have my own email servers & was concerned after indulging in hours of tedious research that configuring the Kindle to receive my email would be difficult if not impossible, simply due to Amazon's customized version of Android the Kindle uses. Bummer :(\n\nSo I went with the Samsung Galaxy Tab. The 7-inch size is convenient and portable.  But, to my amazement, I actually stream movies on this MUCH more than I thought I would & for that reason, might enjoy the 10 inch version, as I don't commute. So, if you're wavering and think you might use it for streaming, go bigger.\n\nNonetheless, I still love my 7\" Galaxy Tab!  Here's why:\n\n1.  Screen resolution is superb.\n2.  Adjusting brightness, volume, etc. is simple and straightforward.\n3.  Samsung's Push Service takes care of all Android updates.\n4.  Can use Amazon's App store or Google Play for apps.\n5.  Email was easy to configure.\n6.  Netflix was \"set and forget.\"  Set it up ONCE.  Use it whenever to watch whatever.\n7.  Don't remember exactly how I did it, but you can do a Google search to figure out how to overcome the \"Adobe Flash cannot be used on this device\" issue.  OH YES IT CAN!  Once you find & install the right plugin, you can stream Amazon Instant Video with ease (PRIME Video, especially!) and watch embedded videos on news sites like Reuters.\n8. Twitter was really easy to configure.  Much more fun on a tablet than a laptop; switching between Twitter IDs is super, super easy on this tablet.\n9. Kindle app works GREAT.  You can easily access and enjoy all your Kindle books.\n10. Audible is EASY, too.  Love it!\n11. MP3s purchased through Amazon are automatically saved on your Cloud Drive.  AND you can opt to auto-download to the device, as you like.  I use this EVERY DAY for my treadmill walks!!\n12.  Micro SD slot for memory expansion.\n13.  GREAT camera; I've even used mine for an impromptu Amazon Video Review.\n14.  Camera with Gallery function that's intuitive.  Never lose your photos again. And it's a snap to email any photo anywhere.\n15.  Touchscreen is responsive without being oversensitive.\n16.  Audio performance is great; I listen with Sennheiser wireless headphones, regular earbuds, and a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pillowsonic-Stereo-Pillow-Speaker/dp/B0002BK7KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pillowsonic Stereo Pillow Speaker</a>&nbsp;at night.\n17.  Comes with its own browser.  BUT it's a SNAP to add a Firefox plugin.  My favorite way to browse.\n18.  Moving data/files from the hard drive to Micro SD card is simple!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "After much research and analysis last Christmas, we decided to buy 2 of these for our kids. We were debating the pros and cons of this vs the various new kiddie talents that we entering the market. The major pro that pushed us to the Samsung was the pure fact that kids like to use gadgets that look like their parents. And my wife and I both have iPads. We knew that getting the kiddie tablets would result in us hearing \"I want to your your iPad!\"  So we got the Samsung, all them their iPads and got a great screen protector (armor shield) and a purple case for my daughter and blue for my son. They love their \"iPads\".\n\nThe interface is easy enough for my 5 and 3 year olds to navigate themselves. We also tossed 32mb micro cards in them and loaded a bunch of their favorite Movies and shows on them. They watch them in the car on long trips with kiddie headphones. Works great and they love to be able to pick and control their own device.\n\nNo issues with either of them after 8 months and I'd buy them again if I was doing it over. Hope this helped!"}

However, it was impossible to install common apps such as WhatsApp or Yahoo Messenger for voice and video. We have managed to communicate through Skype just fine, but since the original idea was to use Yahoo, I was very disappointed to know that the tab did not support the app.\n\nOtherwise it is an excellent product, so I think it is just a matter of informing potential customers of the common use apps that the system does not support, so that they can make a conscious decision."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "OK I'll admit that there is a big cost variance, But I purchased my wife an iPad 4. To save a few bucks, I later took the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.  The iPad is far better. But the Android tab does have a few features that are groovy.  One is that the virtual keyboard includes a number row at the top. (The Apple products require keyboard shift to bring up the number row). Also the suggested data entry is rather sweet.  I also like the automatic updates of apps (although I hear that Apple is working on that one too). I also like the idea that the memory can be expanded via an micro SD card.\n\nA few things that I don't like.  Some of the apps seem to crash more often (the comparable apps on the iPad seldom crash). And I haven't yet figured out the purpose of the different screens.\n\nSo it isn't a bad device, and for the money, it does carry its worth.  It's OK, but not great."}

You should buy LTE galaxy tab 2 because sometime you might need internet access if you don't have a smart phone. If you are willing to pay more, you should buy the galaxy note 8.0 LTE or Wifi only.

I will say I do not regret getting it, and leave it at that."}

One of the biggest issue I have with this tablet is that I can't seem to save my downloads to the SD card and as such I have to delete the movies I have after watching them to preserve the memory.  I also think the battery runs down too quickly.  I also believe there is a strong possibility that I didn't get what I paid for.  Sure its a samsung galaxy Tab 2 but the specs that were advertised, for example, I was told the tablet had a 4.1 Android (Jelly bean) OS and this one that I got is actually 4.0 (ice cream sandwich).

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Have been using this tablet for a while, however, recently updated this fantastic tablet to 4.2.2 Jelly Bean and it runs very smoothly. Very impressed with the performance of this tablet. The Tab 2 is excellent for my everyday basic computer functions at home and on the road. And it is much easier to travel with than my heavy laptop. For you the reader, my goal here is to give you everyday and practical uses regarding the Tab 2 7.0 WiFi model.\n\nPROS:\n\n- EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD -  For me, I added a 32GB SD card. However, there are those who add a 64gb SD card, however, you will have to format it inside the Tab 2 and it will then be ready to add files. *With my new update to 4.2.2, I have successfully moved some of my personal apps to my External SD card. This you cannot do if you still have 4.1 as they store in INTERNAL SD Card area or the main internal area.\n\n- WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi - Very, very fast! This tablet connected to my home router in seconds and even if I am very far from my home router, the internet is strong. This I tested using my home router and on the go at many hotspots with WiFi. . Other hotspots: No problems at all connecting and staying connected on these. And I found the speed still high at home with several devices connected to the router, no loss in speed. **Note that I had other tablets before this one and for me, none gave me the quick connect and overall speed over WiFi as the Tab 2. **Even when I have many devices running, the speed of WiFi is fast on this tablet.\n\n- Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The stock browser does a great job, however, I use Maxthon Browser with great internet viewing results and it renders webpages quite fast for me. And I suggest the free app called Pocket from the Playstore so you can read internet articles later offline. Even TODAY after almost ten months of ownership, I still enjoy using this tablet for viewing internet pages, videos and more.\n\n- Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: This comes with a OK app for reading Office documents, however, I prefer Kingsoft Office which is a free app from Playstore. It is the best I have ever tried and I am very picky about so called Office programs. It is very compatible with MS Office as it reads, edits and creates Office files and reads PDF files, and it has more features of any other Android Office program that I tried. This app is a MUST have for tablet owners in my opinion.\n\n- Printing Using the Tab 2 - Yes, even with my older home printer, I print documents, photos, etc that are on my Tab 2 using the app Cloud Print and PrinterShare Mobile (both free from Playstore. In addition, there are many apps in the Playstore that will allow you to print using the Tab 2. (If you have questions about printing using the Tab 2 or any question, please ask in the comment section and I will answer).\n\n- Watching Online Flash Videos Directly From Maxthon Browser (regular one not the tablet one is best) - If archived flash is installed and Maxthon Browser or other good browsers, I can play videos online. Also, as I May 21, 2013, (with installed Archived Flash), I once again get Amazon Videos to play even in full screen. All videos I have tried have played just fine. ***Please ask me in the comments if you need more details regarding watching online videos of any kind on the Tab 2 and also instructions on archived flash,etc...\n\n- Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried).\n\n- Music Player/Sound Quality - Stock player has clear sound through the outside \"speakers\" and very clear using headphones. To sync easily with Windows Media Player may I suggest the Playstore app free) WinAmp for the tablet as it is very highly rated and the sound is SUPERB!\n\n- Battery Life- Excellent! This is what I have found: When I am on WiFi, I go to the websites I need and then as soon as I am done (reasonable time), I exit the browser (or YouTube, etc) and TURN OFF WiFi. However, I run my brightness at 100%. So on an average day, I get at least 8-12 hours using the tablet before I charge it (depending on how long my WiFi is connected).\n\n- OTG USB Compatible - You can add an optional OTG (On the Go adapter cable to the Micro port for copying files to your flash drive and from your flash drive to the Tab 2). You can also plug in a mouse, I tried it and it worked. *Note that portable external hard drives and portable DVD/CD drives will not work using OTG in the Tab 2 because these both require a lot of power to be compatible with the Tab 2 and most tablets that have the OTG. However, it is still good to know that you can easily plug in your flash drive and copy files to the Tab 2 and from Tab 2 to PC--what a time-saver.\n\n- Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed. Speaking of Bluetooth: Also there are many great Bluetooth keyboards out for the Tab2. (Just make sure you purchase one for JUST THE TAB2 10.1).\n\n- Wonderful Kindle Android App is pre-installed, and I downloaded several Kindle books with no problems. Kindle loads fast and this Tablet is a joy to read a book on either Kindle or any eBook or PDF booklet.\n\nCONS: (Just one con I found, however, this con is NOT the fault of Samsung)\n- New Adobe Flash is not supported, however, I found that archived flash gets the online videos to play. So I downloaded the older archived flash which gives me the ability to view many internet videos.\n\nBottom line: Would I buy this WiFi only model over again? Yes I certainly would and I already did (bought my second one). So if you are looking for a superb Samsung 7.0 inch tablet and you have great access to WiFi, this is the one to buy. Also, since I am a techie person, I will be happy to answer any questions you may have through the comment section."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I got the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 yesterday. Overall, I am more than happy with this. Previously, I used a Toshiba netbook.  It died on me. I took out the hard drive and am using it as an external hard drive on my desktop. The only previous experience I've had with a tablet is my Nook. The Galaxy is far better.\nWhile both tablets use the same Android operating system, the Galaxy allows you to download apps from the Android store. The Nook does not. Any apps you use on the Nook, you must pay for and the choices aren't very good.\nI downloaded a couple of free apps. One app allows me to scan a document and store it on my Galaxy. There is a front and rear facing camera. I downloaded Skype. The resolution on the two cameras isn't as good as the hd camera on my desktop but the portability of the Galaxy should make for a more rewarding Skype experience. With the desktop, I am limited to just a few feet where my desk is.\nThe Galaxy has gps, which seems to be very accurate. Not only have I checked out gps locations on the maps but also I have taken a few pictures which give the locations.\nIf you like to take photos, then the Galaxy Tab 2 isn't for you. The front facing camera is only 3.2 Megapixels, the rear is only vga quality. There is no zoom. There is no flash.\nThe Galaxy has a very interesting feature. When you compose an email, you can speak the words and the Galaxy will input your words into the email.  I tried this several times. Even with my Bostonian accent it accurately input my words. The only other experience was with my cell phone. My words were interpreted as a bunch of gibberish.\nOne interesting thing which results from not having completely read the manual is that sometimes I am completely taken by surprise while experimenting with a new device. There is a feature that allows you to speak the search item in google. A google search page comes up with all the relative search items. I wanted to find out how my favorite baseball team was doing. I spoke the words \"Red Sox\" and a female voice came back to me and said \"The Boston Red Sox are tied in the top of the eighth inning 3-3 with the Baltimore Orioles\".\nAnother thing the Galaxy has that I have been using a lot already is the Bluetooth feature.  I have already paired the Galaxy with my cell phone and desktop. I have transferred some photos and documents.\nThis review is meant to be a \"first impression\" review. I will post an addendum in a few weeks and maybe a picture or two.\n\nUPDATE: 9/2/13\n\nI have had several days to play with this.  I still give it five stars. I find that it is very user friendly.  It can do all sorts of good computer things. I already downloaded several apps that I have used in the past (Words with Friends, Nook, Skype, The Weather Channel, Pandora, and Facebook). I find that the plusses far outweigh the negatives with this tablet.  It is fast and responsive.\nI had an issue with the fact that the music player wouldn't close.  It wasn't just me - several owners complained about the same thing. The issue was resolved when I downloaded the latest OS ( V4.2.2). Now there is a \"close\" option on the music player.\nThe only thing that annoys me right now is the fact that I keep inadvertently press the volume key or the power key and either turn off the tablet or mute the volume. It would be nice if those keys were placed in such a way that inadvertent activation of these keys was impossible."}

I really wanted to get a 7 inch tablet for myself, but my budget wouldn't allow that. So I purchased the Samsung Galaxy 27.0 for my husband, I was hoping he would get bored with the tablet and I would get to use it when I travel. NO, he loves it. I haven't used it much myself, but it responds well an is very similar to the tab 2 10.1,  just smaller. I love my SG Note ll 10.1 tablet, but I have put in a request for Xmas. I have a Asus for my laptop, and love it. So while looking for a tablet for my husband I checked out their tablet (Asus has a great warranty and tech support) but the price is way too much for their tablet. ( Asus products are available but still a newer company,  you can thank ASUS for the Nexus tablet) I give the Samsung Galaxy 27.0 tablet 5 stars for price, function and the ease of traveling with it. Now I just need to get one for myself, as my plan to get my husbands tablet failed. HE LOVES IT! And after 30 yrs of marriage , I'm certain that I'll be getting one for Xmas.

I am not an Android user so it took some getting used to: What is a Widget/App and why they have different pages is beyond me. I was able to sort out the sense of it all in the end (she won't be using most of those items anyway). This came with 8GB of space which was plenty enough room to load tons of games as well as play movies. The movie playing is a bonus because the iPad does not allow for some sites to play movies, but this tablet does.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I am writing this review on this very tablet.\nHave had it for a while now, and use it every day.\nBelow are some pros and cons based on my experience.\n\nPros:\nGood size, the height and width ratio is great for watching movies, playing games, or typing using your thumbs.\nI also like the size for use as a pick it up and go tablet.  I take it on trips, mount it in my car for playing music, and use it out on the deck while relaxing.\nAndroid OS, could be a pro or a con depending on your opinion. There are still some apps and accessories that only work with Apple, but that list is shrinking quickly. And for anyone other than a very basic user, I feel that Android is a better operating system than iOS.\nSamsung integration, I have a Samsung smart tv and I really like how it integrates with this tablet. I use it as a remote a lot.\nPrice, cant be beat when the apple mini is double.\n\nCons:\nNumber1 for sure is the location of the WiFi radio inside the tablet.  If you are right handed, so holding it with your left in portrait mode, you are blocking the wifi signal! I can literally go from dropping wifi to full signal based on where my hand is.  Kinda frustrating to have to consider where I am holding the tablet...\nBattery life, not terrible, but not good compared to the apple counterpart...\n\nI had originally picked this up as a second tablet for something quick to grab and travel with.  But given all of the pr8s, I use it at least as much as my larger tablet.  Very pleased with the purchase.  Especially for the price.\nOnly reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is the placement of the wifi radio.  Which took me forever to figure out why my wifi connection kept dropping.  So hopefully that will help anyone who may be experiencing the same thing.  Just move your hand up on the tablet.\nCheers,\nBSR"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Since I got my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 I hardly use my laptop anymore except for work projects requiring an enormous amount of typing. My list of books to read was getting enormously long waiting to see how the tablet market would handle e-book reading when compared to dedicated e-book readers like the Nook or Kindle. I wanted something that would allow me to be productive while on my train commute to work but would let me indulge in a game or good book just as effortlessly. I studied and was confused by all the iPad clad passengers who seemed less than comfortable trying to read (at such a hefty pricetag nonetheless)...the iPad seemed so bulky...I wanted something smaller! Then came the iPad mini, but for the price it wasn't much of a bargain or great help to me. I kept researching and came across the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and although I think the touch screen needs to be a little more responsive (why I'm  getting  the IVSO Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 Bluetooth Keyboard Portfolio Case) (and the reason for 4 star rating) I like it a lot. I'm reading again, accomplishing tasks before I get to work freeing time for other duties and I like that my toddler can use it for stories or music or educational games. It's a very handy tool and I'm happy with my purchase so far.\n\nUpdate 8/22/13:\nThis tablet has amazing battery life. Just listened to 4 hours of iheart radio (Elvis Duran Morning Show)and the device still has 78% battery life. That's pretty awesome. Speakers are great too.

Hint: Download Dolphin browser and set it to your default internet browser on the tablet, and change it's settings to \"computer\" and have it's flash support \"always on\" and you will really enjoy browsing the internet with it.

The battery, for my usage, has been very good. I don't play games, but I do use my tablet to read and I find it last quite a while. There are a few things I've noticed along the way.  First, you can run out of memory fast if you store too many pix/movies without uploading them onto dropbox/cloud. (I believe dropbox came preloaded and I'd recommend utilizing that so you can upload pix and keep your memory free.)  Lastly, the USB cord for this tablet is unit specific. It does NOT use a typical mini USB and if you need an extra cable for travel/charging/etc...they are a bit hard to find in basic stores. I had to pay about $25 for one on vacation from a Verizonwireless store as that was the only place that carried it."}

It is hard to find a tablet has bluetooth, expandable memory, duel core cpu, and made by a good brand for a reasonable price. Plus you can get a docking keyboard for this tablet which I am using to type this review on. The screen is a good picture so watching movie, playing games, and reading is easy on your eyes. The reasons I am not giving this five stars is because of 2 things. One, it is problematic to sync to your computer even after installing the proper software. When ever I try to plug it in, my computers can't install the proper drivers. Only way I have found to sync it is through wireless and your don't get the full use of the software on the computer. The second issue is the fact it really dislikes any other charger than the one it came with. I have multiple charges the usb cord can plug into and a portable battery charger that it will barely charge from. At least the tablet has a long lasting battery built it but now I must bring the charger for the tablet and the portable battery for my phone. Over all I think I will get alot of use out of this tablet. It is built well and it is very useful. I look forward to using the tablet for classes instead of my big laptop."}

There are 2 little speakers only on ONE side of the tablet, so it's a little weird to listen to the sound come out of one end\n2. You can NOT connect it to your TV. I repeat.. you can NOT. The only things you can plug in are your charger, headphones, and microSD memory card. That's IT!\n3. Can't stream movies from Amazon on it (they are supported by Ipad and Kindle Fire only), but it does have the Kindle Store on it, so you can download books.\n\nthe major positives:\n1. love the clarity/crispiness of the screen (much much better than my old Vizio tablet, but please don't compare to Ipad)\n2. has app to use as remote control\n3. has micro SC card slot (which the Ipad and Kindle Fire don't according to reviews I read)\n4. has Bluetooth\n\nConsidering I bought this primarily for my daughter to listen to music, play educational apps and games, this works perfect.\nIf I had to buy it for me, I would have prefered to buy a table that doesn't have any of the major negatives listed above. My other tablet is Toshiba Thrive 10\", and I'm pretty happy with it. I just needed something smaller and cheaper for the kiddo that I can put in the memory card with her stuff, which is why I bought it used :)\nIf all your stuff is on Amazon (Cloud) and you are a Prime Member and can stream for free, then get the Fire HD.

My only gripe at all is that the touchscreen could be more sensitive, though a stylus makes that a non-issue. Very fast, intuitive,  great WiFi speeds and pretty loud speakers. I don't mind the proprietary charger like some seem to. The battery life is so good I rarely need to charge it, and the connector is secure enough to use it while charging, if you want. Fantastic buy, recommended for a first (and last) tablet purchase!"}

Hmpf.  I gave the Galaxy to my granddaughter after two weeks.  Frankly, it was 'camping out' compared to Kindle Apps for the world I want to work in--reading, translating books/documents, video of instructional videos.  Plus my Amazon Prime account opens up enormous possibilites.  Screen wasn't as good as Fire, lacked sensitivity; hard to navigate through all the Samsung-installed apps that I could care less about.  It was easy to set up and for a teen ager looking for a games device I guess it is ok.  My granddaughter loves it because all she had before was a smart phone so the bigger screen gives her more play area.  For $200 it was the right price to experiment and I had a good fallback, make it a gift.  Bottom line: get the 7\" Kindle Fire.  You will be happier, especially if you install Dolphin as the browser and get a good calendar app like Calengoo."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I can't believe there are so many complaints about the proprietary USB cable.  It was meant to be used for charging only.  To use a USB device, will need to purchase an OTG adapter cable instead.  OTG means USB On-The-Go, which is actually pretty cool.  It can read disk drives, or it can allow the tablet to act as a disc drive, when plugging the tablet into a computer.\n\nI bought my OTG adapter cable from NewEgg.  It's cheap and everything I plugged into it worked great.\n\nRemember to eject/unmount the OTG device via system Settings > Storage > Unmount OTG device before taking the cable off the tablet.\n\nAbout the tablet itself, I will not give a full review, but just a few things people might've overlooked:\n\n. The biggest advantage of using the Galaxy Tab vs other cheaper no-name brands is that apps are usually tested for it.  There are cheaper tablets out there, like the Asus Memo, but they have compatibility problems with many apps.\n\n. Even though the new Google Nexus 7 will blow this tablet away in terms of hardware specs, I still bought the Galaxy Tab 2 because availability of microSD port and because of reliability issues of the Nexus.\n\n.

But I took it home and plugged it into the wall outlet (surge protected) to charge...it almost completely charged and my super-eager niece unplugged it to take it to her cousin and they plugged it in to continue charging while they looked at what apps they wanted to download. Not more than an hour later, it shut down and never revived. I tried plugging into the wall outlet and also my computer...but nothing worked.\nIt is currently enroute to Amazon...and a new one has been sent to me as a replacement, because Amazon does not allow any other replacement but the exact same product - I was thinking of getting something else, but it was not allowed. I am hoping the first one was a lemon and that the other will be fine, but it does not bode well for my confidence in Samsung that the first one came apparently doa!\n\nUpdate: the replacement Amazon sent works great so I am upgrading the stars, but now the power cable has become defunct after just two weeks, it may have been accidentally yanked out of the unit while charging, but again, not really sure (if I was sure I would deduct another star!), I just know that I have to order a new cable, because the part that connects to the wall outlet works fine (tested it with another USB charging device). I was hoping Samsung would wow me. I've seen some really great phones...but all I'm doing right now is hoping the thing does not shut down after the warranty runs out. So far it is working well, although the screen is thoroughly mucky from pre-teen kids using it."}

I can use amazon kindle on it, so I downloaded a bunch of free books! there are so many free apps and software here I can use on it. connectivity is great by both wifi and Bluetooth. battery life is great, i got almost 6 hours of screen on time. it plays youtube videos nicely, actually I can browse internet faster here than in my hp laptop! weight is good to hold for long time. did I miss anything?

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Fixing Bootloop- Here's what works to fix mine when I get into a power on loop. Unfortunately the only fix is to factory reset the device (why I don't suggest storing anything you don't have backed up elsewhere. Store things you need kept on an external microsd), I've scoured the net, but unfortunately found no other working fix (I've dealt with the bootloop twice now). Hold down power and volume up button until the screen goes black (may take some tries at different points of the power up loop). Once it goes black and doesn't restart on it's own press the power and volume up again until it turns on (it will restart the loop again if you try to let it go from here, but if you're like me you'll try anyways, just in case). Once it starts powering up again let go of both buttons then immediatly press the power button again, only. A droid dude should pop up. Let go of power. You may have to try a few times to get to this stage. Once there use volume down to highlight factory reset then hit power (remove your external sd first!!!!). This will tale you to a list with a bunch of nos and one yes. Use the volume to highlight yes then hit power. Once it says it's complete select to reboot.\n\nInstalling Flash- Here's how you install flash(so you can watch videos online and play games on sites and etc).  It's actually really easy. You just have to download flash from the adobe site, it's in the archives. [...] just scroll til you see flash for android 4.0 then click the first download link under that (you will need to click in settings that you can download third party stuff. It will give you the option to do this after you click on the uploaded apk file in the menu to the lower right that pops up when you click on the time). After you change setting just go into the files folder app (yellow folder) go to downloads and click the flash apk. Choose to install. You now have flash. Easy peasy. (Also here's a vid how to from adobe [...]\n\nUsb/Sd Access- If you need access to usb, a full sd card or etc then look up graybean card reader hub for galaxy tab (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/B0084NYYGQ/dp/B0084NYYGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">B0084NYYGQ</a>&nbsp;This is the best product I've found for cost and quality (aka durability).\n\nRemoving Ads- Another complaint I saw was about the hubs and suggests that come preloaded on the tablet. To get rid of these just remove the hubs from your screen. Long press and move to the trash/remove in upper right. No more ads Easy Peasy ;-)\n\nMy review- I also have the original galaxy tab 7 and ended up replacing this tab 2 7 with a tab 2 10. This model is much cheaper then the original, and for good reasons. That said, it is wonderful for the cost and I have already suggested it to a few friends asking me about budget friendly tablets. The tablet is missing some of the features of the original, most notably the camera quality and zooming. I apreciated with the first being able to take nice-ish pics and video of our kids, then being able to show them off on the 7 inch screen. However, the imbedded 8gbs this tablet comes with is very nice for storage and media purposes. Especially for all the apps you cannot move to your removable sd card (on the original you could move apps over with a feature built into the devices app setting- that is lacking in this model. Probably because they gave you so much built in storage). I decided on a tab 2 10 with 16gb instead for the extra room (although I believe you can get 16gb in the 7inch also) so manly the larger size screen making it easier to view things like magazines, websites and streamed video. One of the things I liked most about the 7 inch though is it fits in your purse in place of a planned book, currently being a sahm I find less need for the tablet to be more compact. For the undrr $200 cost this is a great option."}

Netflix and SD card movies work great, I use a basic wired headset headphones, check my email, social media works great, and it's another size to test any Android apps that I write.

How was I suppose to delete any and make more room on it without being able to access the content that is taking up all the space?  Anyways, besides that problem (which it does come with a micro SD slot), it is overall a great tablet."}

Yes I mean using the charger that came with it.\n\nIt loops between a half full image of a battery and an empty one. It was plugged in for over 20 hours but would not take any charge. I looked up the symptoms on Google and found that many many more people are having this exact same problem but Samsung won't say a word about it.\n\nThey sent me to a page to get service that had a broken link on it. Now I'm stuck with a $180 paperweight."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Not a desktop or laptop - once I get over that it is a very adequate tablet.  There are still some issues with some web pages not accepting input properly.  Travel sites are good examples - trying manually to put in dates, etc.  Also sometimes the screen keyboard obscures the items you are inputting and you cannot scroll the rear screen to see what you have already inputted.  Again, it's not a desktop or laptop but gives you good computing on the fly.  It is also much better than my previous Blackberry tablet.  Some sites would not even open because of the proprietary Blackberry OS.  Sometimes if it did open it was almost impossible to input dates.  I like my Samsung."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Overall, this is a well made well thought out device it feels great and is quite light. It runs apps smoothly with a slight delay occasionally. This tablet does not have the best touch sensitivity. Good enough for most tasks but not so good on Touch Intensive apps like Magic Piano. It is almost completely customize-able and with the Google Play Store apps and Widgets can be added with ease. Could have done with a couple more built in Multi-touch gestures but there are a few. I highly recommend taking advantage of the expandable memory slot and also on watching battery life. It does fine with lower screen brightness settings but if they are too high the battery seems to go pretty quick. A great product from a great company. Would recommend, but maybe I also would recommend a Google Nexus 7 first."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I had recently been looking into strong reliable android devices and this is the perfect device for me but just be warned that this is a small tablet. If you have any trouble reading or seeing small things or if you have larger fingers you would be doing yourself a favor by buying a larger tablet. that being said this is a great tablet, compatible with most apps available on the Google play store and easy to use. the 8 gigs of storage will work if you plan on using mainly apps but for those who plan to use the tablet for digital media purposes will find their built in storage quickly filling up. However thanks to the handy MicroSD slot a 32 gig card can solve that issue or (what i prefer) one can easily stream media off a computer in the house through the Local network. i encountered little to no lag on the touch screen and the display is simply amazing for the tablet price. the pre-installed apps are the normal run of the mill basics with a few helpful extras 2 of which really stood out to me. the first is a app called \"Peel\" which interacts with the built in IR blaster on the side of the tablet allowing one to use it as a remote for the TV i found this especially handy when my family loses the remote. the other app is called Polaris office which (after the purchase of a remote keyboard) allowed me to type up documents using the device instead of haveing to lug my 17 inch computer around."}

I've now owned it for about a month, and I'm very happy with it.  I bought this tablet primarily to use as navigation device for off-road traveling.  I'm using Back Country Navigator (BCN Pro), and Roll-Me-Over by DriveHard.  I drive an FJ cruiser, and it was easy for me to mount the tablet on my dash using the Fintie Slim Fit Folio Case [purchased on Amazon] and a little commercial-grade velcro.  The GPS works flawlessly.  It is my understanding that a lot of folks are having a hard time comprehending how you use this unit with the GPS and maps for navigation purposes.  It's really very simple.  Regardless of which navigation tools you choose, you MUST download the maps you'll need beforehand, i.e., BEFORE you travel.  To me it's pretty obvious that you'll only have access to the internet when wireless is available to you, so don't expect to be able to access maps you don't have when you're out on wilderness peak somewhere in the middle of nowhere...unless there happens to be an internet cafe at the summmit ;-)\n\nI also ran a test on the USB charger in the car.  If you plug the USB cord into your car's USP port, it will charge, but at a very reduce rate compared to a regular AC charger.  If you are running the tablet, while it's plugged into the USB, the battery will discharge, but at a much slower rate than if you didn't have it plugged in at all.  It works kind of like a trickle charger. I managed to run my tablet using BCN for about 5 hours, and the battery only discharged from around 89% to about 67%.  When I turned the tablet off, the USB charger brought it back up to about 74% in just and hour or so.  I also have a Samsung detachable car charger [purchase on Amazon] that will charge at the full 2amp rate.  Samsung recommends that you not run the tablet when doing a full 2amp charge, or the battery may not charge correctly.\n\nI also use the tablet for quicky email checks, and web browsing, etc.  It's nice to have it for those things too.  Now I don't have to arm wrestle my wife for the netbook at home, since I have my OWN device now.  Incidentally, I've not entered the smartphone world as yet, so this unit probably does a lot of things for me that smartphone might do for other folks.  However, I have to say that I like the larger screen. But, it's not so large as to not be easily portable.  That's why I wasn't very interested in Samsung's 10-inch unit.\n\nI'll try to remember to update this review if anything new needs to be added."}

I will put mostly music on my 32gb SD card since that is where most of my biggest storage use comes from on the Nexus 7.\n\nThe Camera doesn't have a flash but it is really good at low light. I think the pictures it takes are very nice, however they are for my own pleasure.\n\nI really like that the wireless, sync, GPS, etc are more controllable from a pull down menu from the home screen, much better than the Nexus 7.\n\nI know the screen and colors are a bit better on the Nexus, but it really is hard to tell.  Of course I do not play a lot of action games with it but I do play games like chess and blackjack.  I may be wrong but it doesn't feel slower than the Nexus, and sometimes it appears to be faster. It is made with the same high quality as the Nexus.\n\nThe priority power plug may be considered the only con, but I like the more secure feel.  I did not like most of the apps supplied with the tablet, but that was not a problem since I downloaded the ones I liked from Google Play.  I like the Google Android keyboard better than the Samsung keyboard, and Google calendar is a must.\n\nI can now swipe credit cards with Square Register which was a main reason for getting it, as you know Nexus is lacking this Jack. All of my contacts from Google and all of their Facebook pictures have been synced on my Contacts App. GPS works great from indoors.\n\nSo to sum up... this is a steal at $179 dollars.  It is as nice as the Nexus 7. however, if you have a lots of high memory apps, like games,  8gb of memory will not work for you since only music, books, pictures, and files can be stored on the SD card.\n\nI am very happy with this purchase and would recommend buying this tablet."}

It is flimsy looking because of the plastic body.\n\nOS and Apps:\nCame installed with Android 4.0 but I had it updated to 4.1.1 once I got it connected to the net.\n\nOperation:\nTouch screen with 3 hard buttons.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "After just over a year of using this device, I can say that it's a good tablet for the money but it's battery life and heavy dependence on Google are major negatives. Battery life: now down to less than 2 hours even when doing nothing but playing a non-resource-intensive app like classic solitaire. Heavy dependence on Google - installed apps from Google (and Samsung) are a major pain and inferior to other (mostly) free alternatives. I do not want to forego all pretense at privacy in order to use basic tools, which is what happens if you want to use gmail, search, navigation, etc. A pure Android platform - not tightly integrated with either Google or Samsung - would be much better. The other major negative is inherent to the form factor (i.e., its small size). The device is great for entertainment; don't expect it to substitute for a small laptop."}

I know what you're thinking...\"WHAT? The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 has expandable memory.  Use that.\"  Well, while you would be correct that the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 offers external memory, you can NOT move apps to it.  Additionally, movies purchased on the Play Moves & TV app cannot be moved to the SD card. I'm seriously considering returning this tablet.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter one hour deciding what to do I ultimately decided to return this tablet.  I bought it to entertain my kids with movies and apps while on a 20 hour trip to Greece.  After downloading two games and two movies (NEITHER OF WHICH CAN BE MOVED TO THE SD CARD) the memory was COMPLETELY full.  This makes it useless for my purposes. I am hopeful that Amazon will not charge me a restocking fee because as far as I'm concerned advertising the 32GB external memory is misleading since it's basically useless. The only thing you can put on it is pictures and videos you take (without rooting it, that is, which I am NOT about to do since it would invalidate the warranty).  I am returning this and am instead purchasing a second Google Nexus 7.  For just $30 more I can get 32GB internal memory without the added expense of purchasing an sd card (as I had to do with the Samsung)."}

The tablet worked just fine, and the Android stuff was a lot better than a phone I'd gotten 3 years ago. Everything worked great. I'm giving it four stars because some of the apps I wanted just weren't as good as iPad apps (my husband has one). iBird worked fine, but some of the others didn't. That's not Android's fault, but it's one of the reasons I'm giving four instead of five stars.\n\nI wanted to be able to call my mom's phone using internet from Canada, using GoogleChat/Voice/Talk, but I couldn't from the Android. And I couldn't use Facetime, of course, since it's a mac-only app, but two of my siblings use it all the time. The bird/tree/flower identification apps were fun, but I found I could find plants/animals much faster using my ID books. I loved GoogleSky, which showed the constellations I was looking at. I'll miss that app.\n\nI found out some interesting things about tablets in general. I have a couple daughters, one 7 and one 2, and I thought they'd enjoy some of the apps. They weren't impressed with coloring on the tablet, and preferred paper/crayons. A bubble level app that I thought was lots of fun wasn't nearly as fun for them as my real bubble level. Finding pictures on the internet using my computer at home was much faster than finding them on the tablet. And Scratch, the programming app from MIT, can't run on a tablet. So I found I could entertain them better with things they could hold and manipulate, or using my computer, rather than just using the tablet.\n\nI also got worried about my personal data being somewhat easily available to someone if I happened to lose my tablet.\n\nAfter four days I returned it because it just wasn't worth the money, for me. I have a computer and a laptop, and I didn't want a roaming data plan, so it really wasn't useful enough to justify the money, for me."}

Technically you start off with a 4 gig tab, which would be bad, but at it's current price It's still a cheaper and more capable of a tablet than the Ipad Mini.\n\nOther Thoughts: For me, I'm treating this like a pocket PC. Out the gate I went on GOOGLEPLAY and installed ESET (first months free.) I cleaned up the unwated apps from the main page, downloaded an ereader, uploaded videos and ebooks and so far so good. I am very pleased with my purchase. The Samsung Tab 2, at this price is a steal. :-)"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I debated over buying a very cheap tablet for the kids to play with for about $70 but after reading a bunch of terrible reviews, I decided to spend more for a product from a trusted brand for only about $170 for this Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.  The camera quality is not great and kind of slow, but I didn't expect it to be amazing. I bought it for my 3 year old to take on a 12 hour car trip. He played games and watched movies on and off and it still had battery life. That's all I really ask for in a cheap tablet. It's now our family tablet that we use for games and movies for the kids and it's small size is perfect for just that. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is because it's just not 5 star quality. For that you have pay much much more."}

Other than that this product is worth the price. Have not had a problem with it other than that."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I've owned this product for almost a year now, and the list of cons just keeps growing and growing. Here they are so far:\n\nCONS\n\n1. The cheap plastic housing makes a creaking noise when you hold it by the edges. It feels like it's about to fall apart. I was reluctant to return it for such a trivial complaint, so I ended up opening the case and rubbing some petroleum jelly on the plastic tabs. That reduced most of the noise, but you can see where I pried open the housing.\n\n2. When I bought the device, Samsung strictly enforced the $249 price tag. That was good because I didn't have to worry about waking up the next day and finding it cheaper somewhere else. Then a couple of weeks after I bought it, Samsung lowered the price down to $199, and now it is even lower than that. Of course I expected them to lower the price at some point, but $50 is a huge difference.\n\n3. The device is filled with bloatware that you can't uninstall. The 8 GB internal drive is reduced to around 4.5 GB. A freshly installed copy of the original Windows XP takes up only around 0.5 GB of space, so I marvel at how Android can be so big. I understand that you will never get the full advertised capacity, but this is just ridiculous.\n\n4. When I bought the device it came with Ice Cream Sandwich. When Samsung upgraded to Jellybean, they wiped out all of my customized user icons on the homescreen and replaced them with icons to \"stores\" and \"hubs\" to try to get me to purchase their crap. That wasn't nice.\n\n5. The glossy screen makes it very difficult to see. If I wanted to see my reflection, I'd use a mirror.\n\n6. The Samsung keyboard sucks. They won't allow you to use the default Android keyboard. I had to purchase a 3rd party one.\n\nSD CARD CONS\n\n7. First, let me say that the whole reason I bought this product over the Google Nexus 7 was because it had an external SD card. Otherwise I would have got the Nexus because it has a quad-core CPU and a higher resolution screen for the same price. I thought I could save money by getting the smaller 8 GB device and using the memory cards that I already own. Now it seems like the SD card is almost useless on the Galaxy.\n\n8. You can't load apps onto the external SD card. As I mentioned earlier, half of the internal storage is filled with bloatware, so this is really a limitation.\n\n9. I like to watch MP4 music videos, but if you watch them off of the SD card (which is where you're supposed to store them), the videos stutter every now-and-then. They run fine off of the internal memory, but there's no space to put them there.\n\n10. DON'T STORE ANYTHING IMPORTANT ON THE SD CARD. All of my files magically disappeard one day. It seems to have a lot of trouble loading large files onto the SD card. When I try to transfer audio, video, or image files, they get corrupted during transfer and the entire SD card needs to be reformatted. I've tried three different SD cards and they all behaved the same way. I am able to transfer files using a card reader without any problem, so I know it isn't the card that's faulty. I'm not sure yet if all Galaxys have this problem."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "The Galaxy Tab 2 has two fatal flaws, as far as I see it.  The first is not surprising, but still annoying.  The second is a killer if you connect it to your computer.\nThe first flaw involves the volume/on-off buttons.  They are part way up the right side of the device.  Not too bad, if you are right-handed.  If you are left-handed, though, guess where your fingers naturally fall when you hold it?  Dead on the buttons!  Add that to the lack of a flash for the camera and spotty touch support, it is not a great device overall.\nAs a developer, though, the real fatal flaw rears it's ugly head.  Many times, when you insert the device into the USB port with the cord, Windows promptly reports, \"Hardware ID not found\" and refuses to connect with the device.  This is a software bug, and as a developer, I plug the unit into my PC 20 times a day!  The only real cure is rebooting the whole machine, and even then, it sometimes does not fix the issue.  I tried to get the new drivers, but mine are up to date, and some people recommend actually rolling the drivers back to fix the flaw!  Now add to this part II of the flaw, and you get a barely usable device.  When files are updated on the tablet, they do NOT update in Windows Explorer.  The only way to update Explorer is to unplug the device, which, guess what, causes the aforementioned bug when it gets plugged back in!  And if you unplug the device while Explorer is on a Tab's folder, Explorer force-closes!  Not fun at all.\nSo if you want to use this as a cheap developing tool, think again."}

Very annoying.\n3  The expandable memory is very misleading.  You can add a micro chip to expand to 32 however this extra memory does not apply to APPS.\n  If you can figure it out you can add Movies and Music to the extra memory but if you have kids that love playing with the apps then you are\n  stuck with an 8 tablet.  You can fit about 6 games on it maybe.  You cannot remove the many \" google\" apps that as kids you will never use.\n\nWe bought it for our kids and so far are super disappointed.\nWe were lied to about being able to use our AMAZON PRIME membership with this device(you can only read books.

The one thing I do like is the video player because of the files it can read but then it got ruined by the screen which has very dull, washed out colors and the text isn't very sharp and it is quite annoying. But the most annoying probem is the speakers, because of the size of my hands when i hold the device my hand covers the speakers and i can hardly hear any noice from it.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Pros:\nRecently bought Samsung tab 2. I like the quality of this product. touch screen is very good, one touch works great unlike other devices. There is SD storage facility which is great. wifi is very consistent. Its doesnt disconnect.\n\nCons,\n\nPower button:\nLocation of power button is located on the right hand side, very close to volume button. Often while watching a video i need to increase volume, and accidentally press power button that closes the screen. Really annoying. This is more issue with ergonomic design. Samsung could have put the power button at a different location.\n\nLack of security:\nAndroid software is not secured at all. Very vulnerable to your privacy and trojans. Any one can steal data easily. If you try to download and install an app, they ask to provide you access your hardware such as camera anytime they would want without prior notification. You have you use your google account to do anything which exposes your personal data and information saved in your email to others. There is no way or option that allows user to limit what an app can access. Basically user can not decide what permission to give to an app. ex. music player / radio doesnt require to access your cam but they ask for it. and there is no option with android available to limit the permission to any app. A lot of app ask user to provide them their location which is none of any apps business where i'm located. I tried to download app that claims to be able to limit permission for apps. But tab 2 is not compatible with these apps.\n\nI use iPhone where you can decide if you want to provide permission to access your camera or your location to any app or not and also if you give permission for now and can revoke that permission any time you want.\n\nYou need to log in this device by logging into your gmail account. and its not possible to log off in case any other user in your family wants to log in. So, its basically created for only one user. No option for multi user.\n\nI returned this item. If you do NOT want your personal data/ credit card number, emails get stolen/ exposed to public domain then i would NOT recommend this device ( android operating system) until android introduces more custom privacy settings.\n\nDid not like it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I had been happy with my iPod Touch for more than a year, but wanted a relatively inexpensive tablet I could use more for videos and other graphics-intensive games and apps where the larger screen would be an advantage. I got that and more with this tablet.\n\nPROS:\n\n- I love its customizable wallpapers (including animated wallpapers).\n\n- With the push of one button, I can wirelessly sync it with my Xbox 360 to watch videos stored on my tablet on my TV.\n\n- It plays far more video file formats than my iPod, which won't let you watch anything that's not .mp4 or .mov.\n\n- When I connect to my computer via USB, I can drag-and-drop files onto it, unlike my iPod, which required iTunes. (You can download syncing software for the Samsung tablet, but I've found I hardly ever use it.)\n\n- The screen works in portrait or landscape, unlike the iPod, whose home screen can only be used in portrait.\n\n- Ability to open settings for screen brightness, Wifi, GPS, Bluetooth, etc. from anywhere on the device.\n\n- I'm admittedly kind of a cheapskate, but I love that fact that I can get some free, complete ad-supported games (\"Angry Birds,\" \"Fruit Ninja\") from the Google Play store that I'd have to pay 99 cents for in the iTunes store.\n\n- I bought a 8GB version of this tablet, but I was able to find a very inexpensive 16GB micro-SD card that instantly tripled my capacity. So far, storage is something I've never had to be concerned about.\n\n- Speech recognition is surprisingly excellent, though not 100% perfect.\n\n- Battery life. I don't know how this compares to other tablets, but I use the device pretty constantly, and I've been totally happy with it. You can watch several hours of video on a single charge.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Unlike my iPod, it doesn't charge when connected to a computer unless it is off or asleep. To charge it while using it, you'll need AC power, which is a minor inconvenience (though an AC adapter is included). I ended up buying a cheap extension cord so I don't have to sit next to an outlet to use it.\n\n- A lot of glare on the screen from outside light, but that problem was solved by an anti-glare screen protector with a matte finish. The matte finish sacrifices a tiny bit of sharpness in video, but it's minor, so I wouldn't even really call it a problem.\n\n- I kinda thought a larger device would make a touch-screen keyboard easier to use, but typing with this can be kind of a pain.\n\nSTILL UNKNOWN:\n\n- Music: It has an audio player, but having an iPod I've found I don't have much need for this function on my tablet. I did listen to a couple of podcasts and they worked fine.\n\n- Photo/Video: I've owned this for a few months now and still haven't played with many of the photo or video options. I've taken a few pics that have turned out fine, but most of the time, my tablet is the least convenient camera device I have on hand.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nI wouldn't trade my iPod for the world, but I'm so glad I didn't shell out for an iPad when buying a tablet. I would have paid more than twice as much, and I don't think I would have gotten twice the quality, given the unique advantages of this operating system vs. the iOS. Highly recommended."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I got this to compare to iPad and, frankly, it suffers in the compaison.  It's not that it has limitations so much as it is NOT easier to use; just the opposite.  Apple's products are not perfect but their integration and the design of their software is superior to the latest Android and Samsung adds nothing that is missed except being a bit cheaper.  Unless your budget is really tight, go with iPad; otherwise you will regret the penny-wise and pound-foolish approach.  You will use your tablet more than you expect, and better design pays off."}

I expect to forego that one and hope the OS on the Tab 2 will be upgraded as Android continues to develop.

The first thing that caught me was the high-end brand name coupled with with the affordable price. I've only had it for about 12 hours now but as far as I can tell, she was definitely worth it! I have a Galaxy S3, and this being a Galaxy Tab, the features are identical except that the apps on the tablet are optomized for tablet use. When I opened the Amazon box to dig into my many items, I was a little shocked at the small size but I guess I never took into account how big 7 inches actually is. But the small size is wonderful because it's easy to handle and even fits in my pocket! My one complaint about it is that the keyboard is a bit fritzy sometimes but not enough to warrant a negative review andalso because it's an older older software than what I'm used to using, the S3. All in all, I love it, great value with a low pricetag, perfect combination!"}

Despite the fact that the tablet was protected by a hard shell case and never dropped, exposed to liquids or otherwise abused it died in less than a month. When I say died I mean that the device froze and then completely short circuited.\n\nWhile the tablet was working it was very nice and user friendly and performed as expected. Unfortunately the lack of mechanical reliability far outweighs any positive experiences that my wife and I had with the product.\n\nSince I purchased the tablet well in advance of my wife's birthday I was outside of the thirty day return window which means that I had to eat much of the cost of the device, a device that didn't even last a full month under ideal conditions.\n\nThere's an old saying, namely that you get what you pay for. I now understand why this tablet is $200-$400 cheaper than the competition. My advice to potential buyers considering a tablet is to wait a few more months and save the extra money needed to buy a product that lasts.\n\nVery disappointed."}

While it's only a few bucks more than the \"white box\" models, the quality and thought put into the OS really show through. The screen is great, bright, clear, and sensitive, as well as seeming to be pretty tough and hard to scratch ( I strongly recommend screen protectors on any touch screen device, though, if you plan on preserving it for any length of time). The OS interface is well thought out and bug-free. While the CPU speeds here are a little slower than some tablets being sold, performance is solid without much of any lag that I've noticed. I can't really think of anything bad to say about this tablet, about the only thing I wasn't thrilled about was the proprietary charging connector, but so far it's working great, and there seems to be a ton of accessories available for it. I got a great leather folio case and stylus for it very cheaply here. If you're looking for a 7\" class tablet, I'd recommend this one without any reservation."}

Actual use is what you'd expect from the specs - haven't found any hidden surprises.  The wireless connects to weak signals better than any of my laptops. I thought that the IR Blaster was cool, but the application it came with and others I've seen seem pretty limited.  The screen is fairly bright - I can just see it well enough to do basic things in direct sunlight, almost pleasant when I step under the shade of a tree, and perfect in any indoor setting.  The built-in speakers are not hifi of course, but for a tablet they are pretty loud and reasonably good sounding.  I like that the sd card port has a cover, so you won't accidentally eject it.  The GPS seems to lock on very quickly.  With flash memory as cheap as it is, I wondered why they only put 8 GB on it - but I've put a ton of things on it (keeping my music on the external card) and I've only used a fraction of the 4-ish GB that was free when it came from the factory.  I didn't like that you have to use a special connector to charge it - but there are replacement charging cables available that aren't very expensive.  I'm very happy with this tablet."}

All the issues I read about this are really nit picking.  The sound is very good.  Screen res is perfect...all the the apps run with no crashes so far.  Nice interface and easy to use.  WAY below the $ of an iPad and I feel a better deal over all.  Plus @ $169...you can't lose.  Shop smart, read some reviews and remember how you will use this.  Perfect for what I need and I am very happy."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I bought this as a gift for my 10-year-old who loves to download apps.  Knowing that 8GB of memory wasn't enough, I bought a 32GB card.  Imagine my surprise when we tried to download apps to the SD card and couldn't.  Contacted Samsung and was told that I can only save picture, media, and music files on the SD card.  Everything else has to be saved on the internal memory.  Had I known that, I would've skipped this model and shelled out more money for more internal memory.  This now requires my son to constantly swap out his apps by uninstalling and re-installing the ones he wants to play.\n\nIf you don't care about the internal storage, however, the tablet works pretty well.  You should just know of this serious limitation BEFORE you choose to buy this product."}

For this reason I did not go with the kindle or nook because most of their features (like buying and using amazon content) would not work in Europe. An iPad was more than we wanted to spend. After reading reviews and playing with this tablet in the store we purchased a refurbished model from Amazon. It showed no sign of use, just an open box.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "This is my third Android tablet. The first was from Vizio and it was horrible. Underpowered, unresponsive and not all that cheap (this was a couple of years ago). I returned it on my second day of ownership. My next attempt was with this very same tablet, but running the 4.0 'Ice Cream Sandwich' version of Android. This was much better than the Vizio tablet, but still suffered from uneven performance and a user experience that when compared to the iPad came up short. Again, the price was near $300 and in the end I just couldn't live with it and it too went back to the store.\n\nSo it was with this background that I saw the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 on sale at Costco for $159.95. I noticed that it was now running Android 4.1 \"Jelly Bean\" and remembered reading that this release had done wonders for Android's user experience. \"Project Butter\" and all that. So knowing Costco's return policy was very lenient and it being a rainy day (some people deal with depression by eating ice cream; I buy electronics), I thought I would give it a try. I fully expected to bring it back the next day.\n\nAfter using this tablet for 24 hours all I can say is: Wow! Jelly Bean makes this a whole new tablet. Everything flows, apps work like they should and even the default browser is decent (it has a new 'laboratory' setting where you get a full-screen experience and 'thumb gestures' that are really nice). Netflix streams perfectly, Pandora plays without interruption, the wifi connection is rock solid and the GPS locked onto *14* satellites from inside my house. The battery will go 8+ hours doing web browsing and video with the screen on 50%. Even the IR TV app impressed me where the one last year did not. For $160 bucks this thing rocks and I am keeping it.\n\nPlease bear in mind that this is no iPad Mini, but it's getting close and it has the IR and GPS features that the wifi version of that device lacks. Coupled with the bargain price and this device is near irresistible. It does has its flaws (8GB memory, heavier than a Mini, proprietary connector) but I still give it 5 stars for sheer 'bang for the buck'. If an Apple bigot like myself can like this device, anyone can."}

I guess you can say I'm unfortunate lol but luckily I work and save up my money. With that said I'll just get right to the point. I brought the Samsung Galaxy 2 for only $169, great price. It arrived within three days whitch was awesome. As soon as I got it I surfed the we'd and downloaded games/apps. To my surprise it was fast and I haven't had any problems or crashes yet. If that changes I'll definitely let you viewers know of any change. When whatching movies or TV shows the picture quality is great. It's bright and has vibrant color, I was also suprised at this because the tablet isn't HD. The size is good because it's portable and you can take it on the go while traveling. It also has jelly bean whitch is good too. Over all the product is good, works great, Great value price, easy to use and set up, charges good and charges up fast. I've been using my tablet off the charger for about six hours and I have about 60 percent of battery life left. If you're looking for a tablet to read books then I wouldn't recommend this kind of tablet because books aren't free. The cost of books aren't bad, some cost as little as a dollar depending on what books you get but if you want to read books for free then I would recommend you getting a Kindle. I brought this tablet to watch movies /TV /Play games/ browse the internet and music. So far it met all my needs and I'm happy with my purchase. Also the camera isn't all that great but it works fine for the most part, it doesn't have flash so you would have to be in a room that has good lighting. It's a minor flaw but it's no biggie to me because I have a digital camera any ways. I hope this helped you guys. Thanks for reading."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I've had this now for several months and my overall feeling is that this is a great device for movies and games.  Any work or web browsing, just buy a laptop.  I was extremely disappointed to find out that the extra storage space (32GB card that you buy separately) is worthless because you can't move apps to the SD card and you can't download directly to the SD card.  So what's the point of an SD card?  There isn't one.  I now have to limit my apps and photos and can really only use this device like I mentioned, for movies and games.  It is too heavy to hold up in bed to watch so you have to prop it up somehow with a case/stand or your own pillows.  Also there are many things you can't view online.  Even if you download the Flash player app it still won't show you anything flash based on the web.  In fact, there are very few web based videos that I've even been able to view.\nThe camera is too low of a quality to be used for anything and I find it difficult to uninstall apps and clear up space when I need to.  I was going to re-sell this on Amazon, but decided to keep it just to use for the two things I use it for.  I will be buying a laptop however since this is not at all a substitute for one.  If you are torn between laptop and tablet...BUY A LAPTOP."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I did a lot of research before buying this tablet as this was going to be my very first one. As a happy phone Android power user for three years I had no doubt it was to be an Android tablet.\n\nRegarding the size, I decided 7 or 8 was my goal, as I wanted it primarily as an e-book reader, easy to hold with one hand. I did really liked Galaxy Note 8, however I couldn't justify the price for the extra features. I also checked the Nexus 7, which I believe has a better screen and more CPU power, however I decided on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 because 1) it has an microSD slot, 2) being a techie I know I will sell it in a year or so, and in my area, I can get more money back from a Samsung tablet than an Asus Google and 3) because the price dropped from $200 to $169 in advance to the soon-to-come Tab 3 announcement. 4? )It also looks nicer than the rather ugly Nexus 7.\n\nPERFORMANCE: So far I'm very satisfied with this tablet performance at games, playing videos and browsing.\n\nDISPLAY: It's good, but not great. In Yahoo! Mail fonts look a little washed up. This was solved changin font size in system settings.\n\nE-BOOK READER: I've tried several e-book readers but I'm sticking with UB which is fast and renders nice fonts. I wish this tablet was a little lighter, but I still can hold in one hand for 15-20 minutes before switching hands.\n\nBATTERY: Lot of juice. Charges fast, and if I enable Wi-Fi only when needed, it can last up to two days.\n\nSOUND: Very good stereo sound (strong volume and neat sound).\n\nAPPS (Included): It comes with a few nice apps. Samsung keyboard (with swipe) is very confortable, Peel (IR remote control) works ok up to 2 meters (direct sight). Polaris Office is a very good Office app."}

I actually ended up buying a Kindle after a couple of months. The kindle app for android does not let you lock the orientation and the page keeps flipping if you are reading in bed. You can't read it outside either.  I LOVE my kindle and wish I'd just bought that in the first place.  If you are looking for an ereader buy a Kindle.

I have a Pandigital that works pretty well for what I needed it for.  My scriptures and library ebooks.  The touch screen is really sensitive, mostly.  Sometimes it requires more than one tap but nothing really bad so far.  I don't like that it doesn't like avi's tho.  That's a major pain.  All my stuff is avi.  sigh  It gets the wi fi in my house better than my laptop.  Does well with all my apps and I love that it gets Netflix.  It's technology so there will be lemons in the batch but mine so far is not.  I've had it about a week.\n\nIt freakin died.  I got it on the 4th of June and it is dead 23 days later.  I'm very disgruntled.  It was brand new. While it was working it was wonderful. Hopefully the next one will work better.\n\nMy friend has a galaxy phone and hers did the same thing. She came over and held the power button down for an interminable amount of time and it reset itself.  It's working like a charm again.  We shall see.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "When i bought this tablet here, it did not have a sim card.  Verizon no longer sells them by phone so you have to either pay more than 20 at Best Buy or around 3 at a Verizon Store.  Then you have to activate it. I'd recommend having the Verizon store activate your device.  Otherwise, you get a perpetual attempt by your device to self activate which fails, but it takes a long time to fail and it pops up every hour or so to try to activate again.  And sadly, your device is useless.  I still don't have mine activated.  I've called a few times but haven't had enough time to get through the long wait times to get to the first level of sales.  They will have to transfer you to the prepaid department only after they've convinced themselves that they can't sell you anything.  Another time on hold.  I know it will take at least an hour so I need to wait til I have time.\n\nAnyway, make sure you get it with the Sim card or you might find yourself returning this device as I will if I don't get it squared away soon!"}

I have been very impressed with Samsung lately\nRemote:---- I LOVE the remote on this thing. I quickly set up with me home theater system (TV, Cable Box, Receiver, DVD, etc) The built in app stepped me through the process. and now I can tweak to my heart's content. This is better than my Harmony remote, because I can make updates right from the device without having to hook up to the computer. It also give a live schedule of what is on with single touch access. Better than the guide button on the cable box. Did I mention I love this app??\nAndroid:--- Version 4.0 - Great tablet OS. Like it much better than iOS. I love apple product, but never bought into the apple ecosystem, so I prefer Android.\nKies:------ A cool way to wirelessly transfer data, pics, files, etc. between your Tab and a computer just using a browser. Very Slick, you will like it.\n\nThings I like:\n\nCamera:---- The shooter on this is OK. Plenty of pixels and shoots well in good light. it is OK but not great. Not an issue for me since I never used the camera on my old Tab. There is also not a built in flash. OK with me at this price point.\n\nThings I don't like:\n\nProprietary cable:-- OK, I had to think hard of something I don't like about this. I prefer when micro USB is used for everything from Charging to Data transfer. However, I have a couple cables from my original tab, so again, not a deal breaker for me.\n\nI ordered it here at Amazon, really great price: http://amzn.to/11vPC0n"}

It was completely seal and no damage to the box at all. I will definitely recommend my friends and anybody who would ask me where I got it from. I have already spread the word to everyone at my company. To be honest I am actually using my tablet right now to write this review.

(lol) I absolutely adore this thing! I don't always want to take the time to get my laptop out, especially if I am only needing to look something up quickly, so my tablet is now my \"go to.\" The battery life is outstanding, and that's saying a lot since I rarely turn it off and I am always on Facebook, checking email, or playing a game. I charge it, on average, about every three days or so, and as I said, that it after heavy usage. The Wi-Fi connection is also great because I rarely experience any problems with connection. I had a Nook Color prior to this and the Wi-Fi connection was dreadful at best. I am also a big fan of the Google Play Store because it contains tons of apps, books, and games with a lot of them being free. The 7\" screen is the perfect size for reading e-books, surfing the web, watching movies on Netflix, and playing games. The resolution is comparable to the iPad but thankfully the Samsung Galaxy is much more affordable. I honestly can not think of one negative thing about this product. It is definitely well worth the money. You will not be disappointed."}

I chatted with customer service and he said that basically, only 4GB will be left for you to use.  Very Very disappointed. Looking for a better tablet.\nAlso, the some apps will not let you on them it says connect to the internet and then it says internal service failure after internet connection. So then I complained to a customer service rep who wasn't very helpful and he said there was no solution to this issue. So, just don't get this tablet.

I did many weeks of research, did price and specs comparisons between all the different 7 inch tablets and the Samsung won, hands down. It was great for the money. It had great features that we wanted. It boasted that it ran flash and I assumed that we could do everything we wanted on it. Alas, that was not true. We could not run flash applications on the Galaxy Tab, we could not watch our Amazon Prime shows. Sure we could watch almost anything else, but not prime. It was disappointing to have to put it back in the box after only a few hours of falling in in love with it.\nI had to settle on a Kindle Fire HD because what is the point of owning a tablet if you can't watch Prime on it? There was a workaround but it wasn't worth it. We had to lose the expandable memory, we had to lose the full Play store, we had to lose a camera. It is unfortunate.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "This tablet is really nice.  The display is great, the processor is fast and can handle a lot at once (we ran it off my cellphone hotspot (3 to 4 bars, 3G) and downloaded 6 apps at a time, plus surfing the appstore, and connected to a  bluetooth keyboard with a minimal amount of lag (not enough to really notice).  I have had a Droid phone for 4 years now so getting around this was pretty second nature (I currently have a Droid x2 with 2.3.5).  The case is smooth with no areas that feel unfinished or appear to problematic.  Battery life seems good (we have only had it for a day), and charging was smooth and problem free.  All in all a very nice tablet.  BUT WHERE IS ALL THE MEMORY????  Almos have of the 8 gigs is devoted to Samsungs crapware!  Of all the included garbage (and there is a TON of it- somthing like 2 dozen non-removable apps) the only one we really use is the Kindle app!  To be fair there are some nice things included (backgrounds, live wallpapers, calanders, camera app, keyboard), but there is a lot of garbage that will never get used (Suggest or what ever that stupid space hog is called, Samsung app store, all those samsung apps that are supposed to organize your organization, and others that escape me right now but are there none the less)  I mean come on if I want Netflix, I'll go download the free app- no need to JAM it down my throat and FORCE me to have it take up memory.  It really aggrivates me and makes me want to root the device juat to dump all that stuff (almost)  Thank good ness for the sd card and a handy app called app2sd.  Its free and helps you better manage where your apps live (and the apps move seamlessly between sd card and the tablet).  I realize this is like the computer bundles and that companies are helping offset the cost of the tablet by \"buying\" there way onto our screens,but I would gladly pay $20 extra to not have all that stuff (or even better, how about some seperate memory for all the bloatware?  Sure load up my tablet, but don't use my 8 gigs- instead put all that stuff on an sd card so I can remove it if I want, or keep it there).  Sorry I'll climb off the soapbox now and let you know that this is a wonderful tablet (our first so we may be a little jaded) that makes full use of Andriod and all it has to offer, just be aware that you really only get about half of the memory your promised!\nUPDATE:\nWell after surfing the droid forums I have discovered a MAJOR flaw in this tablet (a few other reviews have eluded to this... read carefully!)  MEMORY is NOT expandable (as stated in description).  Yes you can add up to a 32 gig micro sd card, but the only thing that can live there is files and folders (like sounds, pix, movies)  YOU CAN NOT STORE APPS THERE!!!!!  Come on samsung REALLY??? Wow my oponion of this tablet just took a turn for the dumper.  I wish I could find something else wrong with it so I could justify returning it (my wife loves it as does my kid).  It is like owning an apple product- you can't expand your memory.  Upon further investigation it turns out that Smasung blames Google Android, and Andriod blames the hardware manufacturer (samsung)  BOOOO on Samsung for building this in such a way as to make it seem a lot better than it really is (and it is a really nice tablet, but now I have to keep very close tabs on the memory usage).  Even my old Moto Droid phones let me use the sd cards to store apps on. Frustration aside the tablet is running nice, battery life is accecptable, and the wifi links seamlessly (and can detect hotspots at an impressive distance!)  I'm still torn on this tablet.  So much good about it, and a few really annoying glitches that just leave a bad taste in my mouth.  Unless Samsung changes their ways (It seems this is a pretty common practice with their phones also)I will be hard pressed to purchase their products in the future.  I'm leaving the rating at 4 stars because even being decieved by the false misleading advertising, the tablet does manage the memory very well (over 20 new apps loaded, still a bit under 4 gigs available and platform is running very smoothly).  I guess I'll wait till the warrenty is up then root this puppy."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I had begun to be interested in the world of tablets, and I started to look for a small, budget conscious device, and I found the Galaxy Tab 2 7 Inch, and I am pretty astounded by the quality and value of this device, it does not mimic the cheapness found in similar tablets of this price range, with a highly responsive screen, full Android 4.0, and a good build. Also being a 7 inch device it is very easy to hold with one hand, and it is very light, it is definitely a good choice for those who are on the move often. The device is not perfect though, with a few hiccups.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe device responds quickly to commands, plays media flawlessly, and runs every app without incident, but after a week of using the device, there was an odd slow down of the home screen that occurred for about 5 minutes, I did not get the issue again since, that is the only issue I have had with the performance. I think it was the stock TouchWiz interface, I have since switched to GOLauncher, it's great.\n\nBattery Life\n\nThe battery life is great so far, after being charged to 100% I got 2 days of use without charging, tasks on the device included a little web browsing, browsing and installing apps, and some video/picture taking.\n\nNetworking\n\nThe device is WiFi only; I have had no issues with it, reception is no different than the other WiFi devices in my household.\n\nInterface\n\nThe device uses Samsung's TouchWiz interface; which to my guess is a modified 4.0 interface, it is a nice interface, without lag, but the lock screen seems a little boring, I will probably look into using the default 4.0 interface, or something else.\n\nScreen\n\nThe screen is very good in my opinion, it displays content nicely, and it is very responsive. There have been a few instances where I have sworn I tapped the screen and nothing happened, it could be my error, or the device's.\n\nAudio\n\nThe device features two speakers at the bottom of the device, which sound nice but are not the best I have ever heard. The microphone is located at the top of the device near the 3.5 mm headphone jack, from a little use of the Google voice command feature, I have found no issues.\n\nCameras\n\nThe device features a front and rear camera, the rear camera is 3 MP which takes decent photos, while the front camera is a VGA camera that is good for video chat, it is no SLR camera, but has good cameras.\n\nPorts\n\nThe Tab 2 features a 3.5mm headphone jack at the top, Micro SD slot with door, proprietary Samsung USB port at the bottom. The most interesting is a built in IR Blaster located on the right side, which is supposed to be used with the included Peel Remote app ( I had to manually update the app before being able to use it) which worked very well with controlling my devices (LCD TV, Sony Surround system, Comcast DVR). My only true gripe is the lack of a Micro USB or micro HDMI port to be used with projecting content onto a TV screen, one must purchase Samsung's adapter to do so.\n\nButtons\n\nThe Tab 2 features only 2 buttons, which are located on the right side of the device, the first button is the usual lock/wake button, and a volume up/down button, I would of liked to see a Home button, but the 4.0 interface takes care of that.\n\nBuild Quality\n\nThe Tab 2 has a solid hard plastic build, the back of the device features a soft metal like shell that feels good when held.\n\nPre-installed Apps\n\nThis is one of my gripes with the Tab 2, the device comes pre-installed with a suite of bloatware, that cannot be installed as far as I have discovered, I prefer the default Android apps, with apps I choose to install. It does come with some useful apps such as Netflix and Kindle bookstore.\n\nOverall, it is a fantastic device, with a few hiccups that may only bother a select group of users, being a first time owner, I cannot compare this tablets to others personally."}

I immediately tore open the package, opened the box for the Galaxy and started my set-up.  Right out of the box...trouble.  It wouldn't recognize my home wi-fi.  Wouldn't connect.  It kept searching for an IP address, to no avail.  After 3 hours on the phone with both Samsung and AT&T wireless customer service, we realized that it was a problem with the tablet, not with our wi-fi (every other device in our house was connected to the wi-fi without any problems).  I then manually changed my IP address, which connected me for about a half minute.  I tried to complete my sign-up process, but it wouldn't let me stay online long enough to do so.  Apparently, I'm not alone with this particular problem.  There are Android message boards full of people with identical complaints.  Samsung tech support acted as if they had never heard of this issue before.  I was ready to throw the tablet out the window.  Instead, I packaged it neatly back into the box from which it came, and am shipping it back to Amazon tomorrow.  I'd look elsewhere for a tablet.  This one is far too glitchy (based on other reviews, as well), to deem reliable.  And that's a shame, because I really, really wanted to love it."}

Nothing special to say except that the tablet is bricked.\nSo it's just impossible to use it.\n\nI can add something now. This company is the best company... Imagine.. The tablet is bricked...They proposed me to refund me. I accepted but the tablet must be returned. Unfortunately I am outside US for couple months due to job. They proposed me a partial refund and the remainder when the tablet will come back. I accepted. One month later... nothing (Tablet is still bricked and no refund even partial was done).\nSo in ANY case you must buy through this company. You will be sure to have something... not sure it will be what you expected."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Well I will say that the Samsung is a good product but not great. What keeps it from really shining is the fact that there is no HDMI or USB ports. Just the Samsung 30 pin plug. Now with that being said the charger is a USB plug, and you can hook it up to the computer to download and upload via the cable, but I can transfer files via dropbox and other programs. I would like to be able to watch my netflix by hooking it up on the TV, but alas this is not to be.\nNow with the negativity part out of the way, battery life is excellent, display is clear, main screen is easy to navigate, and the unit responds well to the touch. I have not yet come across any hang ups with applications or the screen freezing like I did with the Acer A100. (My first and last acer tablet) This tablet is good to go at the price range."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I bought this for my wife. I have a droid x (i put ICS on it) and she has a galaxy nexus. Prior to these phones we've had the droid incredible, iphone, droid 1, I also have had an asus transformer TF101 for a year and we've had an ipad1 ... so we have a lot of history with this tech although she is not a \"tech\" person, she just likes things that work and help her organize her life.\n\nThe good:\n- nice hardware\n- the screen is nice and bright, the weight is nice [a tad heavy but not uncomfortable], the feel is great\n\nThe bad:\n- the software modifications to deviate from stock android 4.0. they stink.\n\nAndroid 4.0 has a SUPER nice keyboard. Red underlines for misspelled words, spelling corrections .. the corrections are top notch. This is one thing android 4.0 nailed. Samsung TOOK THE ENTIRE THING AWAY!!!!\n\nThey keyboard with the tab2 REMOVES the red underline, it REMOVES the spelling suggestions. In short it's TERRIBLE. I tried a few keyboard replacements with my wife but they aren't perfect, and honestly I don't want to mess around it with her since she (and I) just expecting it to be the default keyboard in android.\n\nOn top of this HUGE issue, things are confusing with samsung's services and google's. My wife went to create a calendar appointment and it warned her that the appointment wouldn't be saved to samsung's services.... why do I care? It's a google cloud device? This confused my wife and concerned her, I told her to not worry about it because it was a samsung service but it would still sync to google in the end. WHY DO THIS?!?!?! Why confuse your users with 2 redundant services?\n\nIf vendors are going to differentiate themselves, DO IT IN A POSITIVE WAY! Don't differentiate by confusing users, taking AWAY nice features, and putting together redundant services in ADDITION to the default ones and force the user to choose services when not really understanding or NEEDING to understand why there are redundant services to begin with.\n\nI'm most likely going to return this if my wife can't live without the keyboard working like android 4.0 works and we can't find a good keyboard replacement without trying 50 different apps. I chatted with a samsung rep via their website and they apologized but that was it, certainly no plans communicated to fix the keyboard issue.\n\nI'll consider the asus tf300 or wait for the rumored asus 7\" tablet they are developing with google since I KNOW that will work as intended without confusing redundancies and a botched keyboard.\n\nIt's a shame, the hardware is really really nice. It feels nice in your hands and looks sharp. But software is important too, and samsung screwed it up."}

The only issues Ive run into so far is an audio issue with Skype, i still haven't addressed (Ive only had it one day). It arrived with 85% battery so you can get allot of use out of it right from the box till the initial recharge. i do recommend a screen protector as the screen collects fingerprints very easily (insert witty metaphor here)"}

But since my phone is not too bad and does what I need it to, I decided to try a tablet for the first time. It is really handy to have it, just like a laptop except that you can turn it on in less than 30 secs.\nThe battery life is really good, when it says 10% left, it easily lasts for another 20 mins depending on what you are doing; but that's more than enough to grab your charger and plug it in without having to rush to avoid losing files. And it lasts for days in standby, one time I left it on the corner of my desk and it lasted for 5 days with over 15% left.\nThe most intense use I have done until now was using bluetooth for the keyboard, wi-fi and video call with skype as well as 2-3 other applications in background switching from one to another to study, I did it for 3 hours straight and only used up 25% of the battery going from 80% to 55%. And to me, it looks really quick to charge although I have not been careful to it because I charge it at night whenever it is down 20% .\nI only put 4 stars to it because I think they should have put a USB port on it, and I would recommend to take one 3G/4G compatible so you don't have to look for wi-fi everytime."}

I don't own a smart phone, but I figured this tablet would slake my lust for apps and having a mini computer on the go. This really fit the bill, it seems! It's not too big, not too small. It's big enough to fit in a bag, purse, or even a really big pocket. It's a basic, android platform, so it is something I will have to learn more about, but the touch screen is beautiful and the features are really customizable. It runs on the google play app platform (essentially basic android) and even comes with google voice!\n\nThe thing I love most about it (and it was a dealbreaker for my other options as well) is the fact that it has the ability to add up to 64GB of extra space (for the 8GB version) on a micro SDXC/ SDHC card. It was the second purchase I made as far as accessories. It  never hurts to have extra room.\n\nIt's weighty but it's not too heavy, which is why purchasing a sturdy case is a good idea. The last thing you'll want to do is spend all this precious money on it and have it scraped or damanged somehow. So a good quality case is a must! Another investment I highly reccomend is a 7 inch basic screen protector. It might give you bubbles (or you may have the ability to push them out,if you're unlike me) but it's definitely worth the protection they give!\n\nDon't forget to protect your new Galaxy Tab 2! Even though it's a tablet, it can still surf the internet and there still are monsters out there with new ways to infect your machines! Free antivirus apps (whichever one you choose, you will be always better off!) are abundant and so helpful in detecting unwanted junk corrupting your device!\n\nLiterally my only complaint with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is the fact that it has a lot of pre-loaded apps that you can't remove- a lot of them are redundant and do the same things (like, why do I need 3 media players/ game apps/ magazine subscription apps?) I hear it's possible to remove some of them, but not others, and it's not an easy task. (someone correct me if I'm wrong though?)But really that doesn't even bother me so much!\n\nHighly reccomended!"}

It came down to between this or the Nexus 7, and after playing around with my friend's Nexus 7 (wasn't all that impressed) I took the plunge with the Galaxy.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Very quick and responsive. I'm one of those OCD stylus guys, so I also purchased Samsung's special tip stylus with the Galaxy. It works very well.\n\n2. The setup wasn't bad at all, and it only took me less than 20 minutes to have my Galaxy running across all of my Google applications. I had no problems with any of them. Gmail, Google Drive, Maps... they all work flawlessly. You don't need Chrome or vanilla Android to streamline the Google experience.\n\n3. It has a MicroSD slot! Folks, this was the deal maker and breaker for me. The Nexus 7 (for some mysterious reason) does not have a disk expansion slot. The Galaxy Tab 2 may only come with 8GB native memory space, but throw in a 32GB MicroSD and you've suddenly got 40GB.

It works great and allows me to write using Google Drive with much more portability than my laptop. The days of not being able to use a tablet as an effective word processor are over!\n\n5. Has both front AND rear facing cameras making it great for Skype, Instagram and other social media applications.\n\n6. The PRICE! The value can't be bested at this point in time. You're getting a quality device for next to nothing that easily rivals an iPad mini.\n\nCons:\n\n1. It doesn't come with a USB transfer cable, which I think they could have thrown in. But just download the WiFi Transfer App and you'll never need that cable again, anyway.\n\n2. I'm not just going to sit here and make stuff up! So far, there are no other cons.\n\nSo if you're on the fence, jump into Samsung's backyard. Google just hasn't quite figured out how to balance quality with value yet, even though they're on the right track with ASUS. But unless you want to wait six months for the next gen Nexus (which will still be more money), get yourself a Galaxy Tab 2. You won't be disappointed!\n\nUPDATE:\n\nActually, it does come with a USB transfer cable (I just didn't realize it because the cable also serves as the wall charger adapter). But you still would never need it with that awesome Wi-Fi Transfer app.\n\nUPDATE #2:\n\nI've found one CON that, according to my research, is more of an OS/Google problem than a Samsung problem... though a problem nonetheless. Unless you \"root\" your tablet (you can search the web on how to do that), there is currently no way to transfer apps to the external SD card. Since game apps can often be very large (some up to 3 or 4GB), you might lose space on the native memory very quickly. With that said, ANYTHING else can be easily saved or transferred to the external SD card (e.g., music, images, movies, docs). Since I haven't downloaded any giant games, I haven't had an issue with this limitation. However, I realize that a lot of people play games more than anything else on their tablets, so this would definitely be something for them to consider. I really hope that Google resolves this issue with future Android updates for the Galaxy series."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "A little confusing at first since I am not very savy with the more modern technologies (I do own a lap top, and a cell phone that I use mostly for calls & text messaging) but this is my first tablet. While a bit frustrating at first, after a few day of tinkering I am enjoying it much more. Wish it had or allowed you to download Adobe Flash (If you can please let me know!) I have no problem watching certain shows from my lap top but can't seem to watch them on the tab as it says Adobe Flash is required & wouldn't let me download it. I am not sure how to use the Google Play (Watch Movies & TV) app yet, but I glanced at it & it appears it has a list of what movies/tv shows you can watch for free (and of course the one one or two I want to watch are not on there). I downloaded Chrome as my internet browser & am very happy I could do that since it is what I like the most (like everyone else used internet explorer & the like for years, but since becoming familiar with google chrome I hate those browsers now.) I know, not an in depth review, but again I am not one of those that knows all the ins & outs of this technology to discuss it further. Still trying to figure it out. But, despite the frustration of not knowing exactly what I'm doing sometimes, I am pretty satisfied with this tablet & enjoy using it for email, internet browsing, & easy access to the games I usually have to get on my laptop to play (i.e Words with Friends- as I don't have an iphone of android phone, just a simple talk & text phone with minimal internet use for checking the weather & that kind of thing.) But I do have wi-fi so using the tab at home has been great, just waiting to see how it does when I take it places. Anyway, I like it, and am happy to be learning how to use these fun (modern tech) things lol :)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Hello everyone, if you are reading this for the device then read no more because the device is incredible. think of a it as Giant version of the very popular and successful Samsung Galaxy S2 in which was so popular that it even received the 4.0 I.C.S update AND EVEN the 4.1 jellybean update along with this device!! The problem is not with the device but the horrid delivery company \"ONTRACK\". (this is not the 1st either) I had no problem with the transaction. but the delivery of the package was incredibly bad and irresponsible. I ordered the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.0 for my mother's birthday on the 22nd. it arrived much earlier then expected which was today January 17th at around 10 am, 2 days from when I ordered it with super saver shipping (I'm a college student with a part time job with expenses)as I normally do if I either am not in a rush to get it or simply do not have enough money (1st mistake). He arrived and took not 5 steps away from the delivery truck after getting the package and THREW IT ABOUT 8-10 FT OVER MY THE STAIRS (leads to my porch) in which caused the package to flip over 2 times making 2 VERY LOUD THUDS in which I assumed it was my mothers pottery plant that broke Because IT WAS THAT LOUD. it was completely horrid and irresponsible knowing how fragile that device is with  the 7 inch screen. I have not open it because I also purchased amazon's gift wrap which would make the $3.99 that I forked over a waste of money by opening it. I have to wait until the 22nd until my mother opens it to see if it is damaged (most likely is). I have never had any problems with amazon in general, BUT I have had multiple problems with the horrid delivery company that is \"ONTRAC\". from having to go on a wild goose chase throughout my neighborhood trying to find my packages that somehow ended up blocks away from my house to having my packages irresponsibly delivered, this company has done it all. The Problem was not only \"ONTRAC\" but the retailer's department in which failed to label the package as \"fragile\" which is completely relevant due to the device's 7 inch display, but that still does not give the individual in charge of the delivery a right to throw my package like some sort of football. I was even tempted to press charges on account of the companies complete lack of responsibility if It was not for Amazon's very helpful customer service.  Do not at all be discouraged with the device by any means because I highly recommend it, 5 start rating for certain. The only reason I gave it a 1 star rating was to get peoples attention,  BUT a word of caution. If you are going to get this device then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT GET \"FREE SUPER SAVER SHIPPING\" BECAUSE THEIR IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT YOU ARE GOING SEE THIS \"LOVELY\" COMPANY DELIVERING YOUR PACKAGE. FORK OVER THE COUPLE EXTRA BUCKS AND GET STANDARD. \"ONTRAC\" is where amazon \"dumps\" most of all the orders with free shipping that come in this size or bigger. I have never had a problem with Amazon at all and i'am even considering getting amazon prime, but \"ONTRAC\" is a totally different story. If you are on a budget to get this device and want assurance that it will not be delivered by \"ONTRAC\"  then you might as well go to Best Buy (ignoring all of the ridiculous insurance of course) and buy it. even though I am very fond of amazon I rather have that extra assurance of not having my packages delivered by \"ONTRAC\" anymore. From now on anything 100$ up that is fragile like this tablet I am going to try my best to get it at the nearest retailer unless I am assured that it will be delivered by a trusted Delivery company  like  USPS,UPS, or even FED-EX. Thank you for your time and I hope you have taken to account on what I have said from my own personal experience.\n\n**********EDIT**********\nI gave it 5 stars because its a unfair to Samsung and because of negative feedback from giving the product 1 star."}

I have upgraded my rating to three stars however, because the device is durable and user friendly. Except for the vexing slow charge rate it is a great product.\n\n(my May 15 review)\nAs mentioned by many previous reviewers, this device drains battery moderatly fast, AND plugging in charger does no good. Even while plugged in the battery drains. With a 12V charger in a car, or a 120V home charger the charger can not keep up with the battery drain. This frustrates the h*ll out of me. Thus you can't use it for a substitute for a auto GPS, you can't watch several hours of TV or movies on it, etc. etc. That is why I only gave it two stars. I was hoping I could plug it in and have it on all day. Nope, you can't. It dies.\nOther than the battery issue it is five star perfect. No learning curve, great qwerty keyboard, well thought out. If you are only going to use it for an hour or two each day it is a fantastic value. If you are near a wi-fi outlet (Starbucks, Lowes, Dunkin Donuts, McDonalds, Burger King, Public Schools etc. usually have free public wi-fi in the immediate area)you get free internet and can read Netflix, harvest email, or do whatever on net for free!

Easy to set up and move around even if you haven't had any tablets before. High resolution display and very sharp colors, easy accessibility to apps and sensitive touchscreen.\n\nThe only thing we couldn't figure out was the camera when used for video chatting using apps like ooVoo and skype. It goes nutty and it flips the view sideways no matter how you turn the tablet! Tried settings and changing the view mode but it won't budge. Gotta work on this one a little and try some other apps to see if it might work with them. The camera itself works great when snapping pictures or recording.\n\nOverall, a great buy!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Back in November 2011 I decided that 7\" tablets were the sweet spot for me, roughly the same size as a paper back novel, and about the same weight, I was going to get a Dell Streak7 but Dell discontinued it, so I ended up buying three Samsung Tab 7.0 plus in early 2012, I was quite happy with them, until I dropped mine just about a year later and broke the glass - the 7.0 plus has been discontinued, so I replaced it with the Tab2 7.0, the subject of this review.\n\nI'm a wee bit disappointed that it does not have 5GHz WiFi, but I can live without it, the same goes for the flash on the rear facing camera, and delighted to find that the Tab2 has much better battery life than my old 7.0 plus - I have no idea if this is OS or hardware related as the 7.0 plus is running Ice Cream Sandwich, and the Tab2 7.0 is running Jelly Bean - but with the 7.0 plus I could easily drain the battery in a couple of hours and had to remember to disable the WiFi when not using it, the Tab2 in contrast has been running with the WiFi on for over two days on the initial battery charge.\n\nWell - after six months with the Tab2, I am out of storage space - my not so favorite app, Zinio, for reasons best known to them (and despite promises to do so) won't let me store magazines on the SD card and filled up my storage.\n\nI dragged out the old Tab 7.0+ and found a genuine Samsung digitizer on ebay and fixed it - the colors on the old 7.0+ are much more vivid than the Tab2."}

Unfortunately, the one function I absolutely needed, the ability to scan credit cards, did not work at all on this model."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I've been using this Samsung tablet for over a year now and have been slowly compiling experience and opinion about this device.  Only now have I really formed an opinion.  Since the Galaxy Tab 2 is getting a little older now, this review may be more helpful as a what to look for guide in newer models.\n\nLet me start with the good.  This 7 inch tablet is compact enough to take almost anywhere.  In many ways, it is a miraculous device.  Such a device would really have been nearly inconceivable just a decade ago.  But do technological achievement and novelty translate into utility?\n\nThe tablet serves well as an e-reader.  As such, it does have its drawbacks.  I also own an e-ink Kindle and would say overall the Kindle is a superior e-reader.  Still, the tablet is convenient and portable.  I probably wouldn't want to do multi-hour reading sessions on it;  it's also not good for reading in sunlight, but it is serviceable as a reader.\n\nIt also serves well as an entertainment device.  My children see it as a gaming toy.  So do their cousins.  Anytime we go on a trip, the kids mob the tablet.  It's also good for streaming Netflix and other videos, although the screen is so small that you really only want to do this when no other device is available.  But this is the trade-off of portability.\n\nIt also works for keeping contacts, calendaring/scheduling, and taking short notes.\n\nNow, the bad.  In many ways my experiences with this tablet have been frustrating and leaving me yelling out that this tablet is just a toy.  Allow me to enumerate several such experiences.\n\nGoogle Navigation is basically useless on this tablet.  After I purchased it I thought I might be able to use it in place of my Garmin as a GPS navigation device in the car.  Wrong!  Without an active Wi-Fi connection, Google Navigation is nearly inoperable.  If you pre-load your destination route BEFORE you leave, it might get you there.  If you need to visit a new destination while you're out, you are up a creek.  Really, Google Navigation was designed to use on cell-phones with constant connection to cell towers, not for tablets with no cell service.  I see why they originally designed it this way, but for tablets it is an epic failure.\n\nThe main camera on this tablet is utterly lacking.  It takes low-grade pictures and lacks autofocus.  Lacking autofocus turns out to be a real Achilles heel as several apps I've attempted to use have it as a requirement.  As a result, I can't use this tablet to scan barcodes or QR codes!  Pathetic, but true.  Also, my mobile deposit app reliability suffers for the same reason.  When I first realized I could use my tablet to do mobile deposit I thought I had found a real utility for it.  Only to have my hopes crushed by no autofocus.\n\nI've been learning to tune pianos, so I really was excited to find the tuning apps available.  After playing around with these apps, I realized that attaching an external microphone to the tablet would improve accuracy.  Surely this would be a possibility?  Uh, no, not really.  I have found some crazy guides on the Internet, but it is crude at best and too much effort to boot.  Not being able to easily attach an external mic was something of a shocking disappointment for me.\n\nA few words about Android.  It's not as refined as I expected it might be.  It mostly gets the job done, but is really simplistic.  I'm not sure if it's an Android limitation or a limitation to my specific device or browser, but it can't really multitask.  For example, if I tune in to an Internet radio channel, then open a browser tab to surf the web, the audio dies.  Kinda lame.  Android is neat for what it does and that it exists at all, but the user experience is pretty average.  My tablet started out with Ice Cream Sandwich installed and then Samsung updated me to Jelly Bean, a step backwards in my estimation.  Jelly Bean made my tablet look more like a phone with tiny little buttons and icons even though my screen has more real estate than that.  In my opinion, ICS is better for tablets than JB.\n\nLast, but not least, this tablet does not have a user replaceable battery.  So far it hasn't been a problem, but unless you are willing to undergo a somewhat risky replacement operation, you'll have to send it in to Samsung and will likely be without your tablet for at least a week.  For me this wouldn't really matter since it hasn't proven itself indispensable anyway.\n\nIn summary, I would say this tablet is more of a toy than a useful tool.  It's close to being more useful, but has not quite reached primetime.  If I were to sum it up in one word, the word would be: frustrating."}

Even though tablet did not come in original packaging. It still look like brand new. Still had the plastic covering the front and back of the tablet.\n\nPrevious to this my only tablet was a 32gb HP Touchpad brought when HP was blowing them out. But I hardly touch that tablet now. I also have a Samsung Galaxy 5.0 Player. So when I brought this item at that great price I jumped all over this. I figured a little bigger screen and also a much version of Android OS in it compared to the 5.0 Player.\nI really like the form factor of the tablet. It's so much easier to handle and carry around. It says you can use up to a 32GB micro SD card. Which is the same for the Galaxy Player. I have been using a 64GB micro sd card since the day I brought it with out any problems. I loaded up the card with tons of K-pop mv's, performances and concerts. They look wonderful on this screen. All videos are in 720 or 1080P. I had some problems with the stock video player installed on the tablet. Some of the videos would not play. But I d/led the MxPlayer app and installed it. It's a free app. And it play's all 720 & 1080P avi, mp4, mkv, ts & tp video files I have installed on the 64GB micro sd card. What more could I ask for.\n\nWhen my grand daughter comes the first thing she ask to use is this tablet. She is also into K-pop. I am going to get her one for her birthday.

The biggest downside is the Samsung specific charger port, which is the only port on this tablet. i have a 'case with keyboard' that i love and trying to find the right combination of adaptors to work with this tablet has been a challenge."}

I just gave her just a few lessons and now she's downloading all her Bible apps like crazy, listening to her music and browsing and reading email. She's now online most of the day, since she can tote the 7-inch tab around with her anywhere. The battery lasts almost a whole day and is light enough to hold for long periods. She is so happy and of course, that makes me even happier. It was the best gift I could have given her, she says, and I agree! 100% satisfied. Oh, I purchased one for myself too!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I was evaluating a 7\" tablet for my son and chose this one.  The others I was evaluating were the Asus Google Nexus 7 and the Apple ipad mini.  I chose this one over the ipad due to price and Apple's iOS (for those with early generation ipod touch's, like me, they know that Apple routinely forces the obsolescence of their product by requiring developers to use the most current generation of iOS which Apple does not support on their older devices).  I selected the Samsung over the Asus again for price but also because the Asus does not have a micro SD slot.\n\nThe Galaxy 2 Tab is excellent.  The graphics are great and it's easy to install applications.  Battery life is decent (about 6 hours of active use between charges).  No issues to report so far."}

I guess they assume that the SD card should only be used for mp3's, photos, and videos.\nSince I only bought the 4GB Tab, I quickly filled up the on-board memory with different apps & games only to find out that if I wanted new games, my only choice is to delete some to add others.\nThis isn't Samsung's fault, but something people should consider when purchasing a new tab."}

I was so pleased with my tablet I went out and bought a samsung galaxy phone.\n\nI use my tablet for school purposes. Mainly to replace my laptop for matters of online books, online homework, online notes, and writing emails. It can be a little annoying to type, but I knew that purchasing it. And I know there are cases with keyboards. It feels a little small sometimes, but I wanted the small screen for easy of transport and I got just that. Precision styluses are lacking in availability in general, and decent free apps for student uses are sometimes hard to find - but that has NOTHING to do with the tablet.\nThe cord is annoyingly short - but I can probably buy a different one. The charge drains significantly on standby with the wifi on (like if I forget to turn it off over night), but a full charge can last me all day which is a more important function anyway. It has a pretty decent memory storage, too - I keep forgetting to buy a memory card because I haven't needed one yet and I store a great deal of pictures and files.\nI bought my tablet refurbished January of 2013. It has traveled in a generic case in my backpack almost everyday. It has held up well and has become an important staple to class."}

Buuuut, I wanted to be able to drag my computer around with me so I could talk to the people I mostly contact via internet. I mean, what if I miss something exciting while I go cook dinner? Would be dreadful. Trying to put a desktop in your lap is painful. Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit, basically just saying that when tablet's came out I was very interested. But I didn't like their prices, for I am a cheap cheapy cheap person. Then this one went on sale. And so I talked myself into buying it.\n\nDo I like it? Yes! I like it so much I'm getting my mom the 10.1 inch version one for. Mother's Day. I mainly went with the 7 inch one so it would fit into my favorite bag and be less likely for me to drop while carrying around. That said, for older people I think the larger size would be best. This one's great for me, but my mom usually has to zoom in a little to read words (keep in mind you can make the font bigger in the settings) or hit buttons. I think the larger one's a better fit for her and the price isn't that much different. I'll also be getting her a keyboard for hers. Overall I like the touch screen one this system has, I just think she'd respond better to a \"real\" keyboard. I hit the M button instead of the space bar fairly often on mine, and just think it's a nice upgrade to have the Bluetooth keyboard.\n\nDownsides? Eh... I wish it was Flash compatible. And no, I don't mean with an outdated version of Flash. If I want to see something related to flash I have to fire up my aging desktop and make it show me, but I knew that before I bought the tablet, so I don't hold it against it.\n\nSo, yes, I love my tablet. It's very nice to drag the internet around with me."}

Other than that it is just the way I bought it a year ago.  I love the size as I mostly use it for reading, internet, and YouTube.  I have an iPhone and my dad has 2 iPads so I'm aware of how Apple works but I prefer my little android tablet for the way I use it.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Samsung Galaxy Tab 2\n\nBefore buying the Tab 2, I read several Consumers Reports articles on tablets.  (Oct 2012 and Feb 2013)  I wanted a tablet so that I could read ebooks, surf the internet, read email, take an occasional picture, view pictures imported from other devices, and maybe do a little GPS navigation.  I did not want a monthly bill for a 3G/4G connection.  The Kindle Fire HD has a good price, superior speakers, but has no GPS or camera.  The Google Nexus is highly rated and inexpensive, but has only a front camera - good for Skype but not for taking pictures.  The iPad Mini is highly rated but expensive and lacks GPS.  I had some difficulty discerning the pros/cons of the Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus and the Galaxy Tab 2.  The Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is actually a year older than the Tab 2 and runs an older version of Android (3.2), but costs quite a bit more.  The only significant advantage I found in it is that is more internal storage - either 16GB or 32GB.  However, you can buy a Tab 2 with 8GB and install a 32GB micro SD card at a lower cost than a Tab 7.0 Plus.  The front camera on the Tab 2 has less resolution - 640 x 480 - but that is plenty for Skype, I think.  CR also rated the Toshiba Excite and Toshiba Thrive.  The Excite is highly rated but very expensive.  The Thrive is a bit lower rated than the Google and Samsung models, yet costs more.  So there you have it - I chose the Tab 2 and got a good sale price.\n\nI had a strange experience when I went to buy it.  The salesman tried real hard to get me to get an iPad - to the point of bullying me, I'd say.  He said he had a Samsung and got rid of it and got an iPad instead.  Maybe that was the truth, maybe not.  I pointed out that the iPad doesn't have GPS, and he said that GPS doesn't work well on a tablet anyway.  He said that the Samsung would not work with iTunes, which is true.  With the Galaxy, you can either sync music and photos with Windows Media Player or Kies, which is free software that Samsung provides at their web site.  I have used iTunes with other MP3 devices, and I tried both Windows Media Player and Kies.  They both work fine, but maybe not as well as iTunes.  Kies helps you install firmware and software updates on your Tab 2 or other Samsung device.  It is supposed to be able to import playlists from iTunes, but I did not succeed at that.  I created my own playlists in Kies.  Maybe the salesman figured that since I was twice as old as him, I couldn't figure out the Tab 2.  Or maybe he wanted a bigger commission.\n\nThe most pleasant surprise was that the Tab 2 prompted me to enter my Google username and password, and that immediately made my Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google+ accounts available and synchronized.\n\nThe most unpleasant surprise came when I tried to print an email from the Tab 2.  I was informed that I could only print on a Samsung printer.  Well I am not going to get  Samsung printer.  I read on another review that the EasyPrint app makes it possible to print to other printers - I'll try it.\n\nI was annoyed that the Gallery app has an icon to make it easy to upload pictures to Google+, but not Facebook.\n\nIt has voice recognition, so when you want to enter text, there is a microphone icon.  Click it, and speak, and the words you speak go into the text box.  Works pretty well, and is fun.\n\nEverything I read said it had Android 4.0, but mine has 4.1.  Apparently the change was made at the end of 2012.\n\nThe Tab 2 is slippery and hard to hold on to.  I keep mine in a cover all the time, which takes care of that.  I didn't find many covers that were custom sized for the Tab 2, so I got a universal sized one, which works fine, but is a bit larger than necessary, so it won't fit into any of my pockets.\n\nIt has blue tooth, but I haven't made use of it yet.  It would be good with a blue tooth keyboard.  My Chevy Equinox allows blue tooth phones to connect to the sound system, but not tablets.  It also has an infra-red light, and Peel software, to make it a remote control for your TV, DVR, etc, which I have not tried.\n\nThis was my first Android device.  There is no user manual on the device, or in the box, but a decent user manual can be downloaded from the Samsung web site.  It is reasonably easy to figure out how to do things on the Tab 2.  If you are new to Android, you have to try things and see what they do.\n\nI'd give it five stars if they would add a capability to print to any wifi printer and an icon for uploading pictures to Facebook."}

This tablet has a very sleek design and is easy to use. With the new software, the screenshot button is no longer there, but taking screenshots is still possible. If I had a keyboard attachment for this tablet, I would take it to school with me instead of my giant laptop. This was by far the best electronics purchase I have ever made! I would highly recommend this to anyone; I only wish I had enough money to buy one with a large screen.\n\nnote: don't lose the Samsung charger that comes with the tablet - replacements are pricey and your tablet will only charge with the samsung transformer or an iPhone charger block (and not well with the latter)."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I received my Samsung Tab 2 tablet yesterday and this is my first tablet. So far it is every thing I wanted in a tablet. I use a laptop PC for my business and a HTC One X Smartphone for both business and personal use.  I love my smart phone and the Android 4.1 Jellybean platform so I wanted a tablet that uses the same Jellybean OS which is why I did not look at any iPad products, price was the other consideration. This tablet came with the Jellybean update already installed. I wanted something that bridged the laptop and smart phone so that do not have to use the laptop at home and on personal traveling. I need access to personal and business emails when at home and on the road which this tablet does perfectly. I also looked at the 4G tablets but as my smartphone has Wi-Fi hotspot capability there was no need to pay over $150 more for the 4G tablets. The hotspot works great on this tablet. I also found that by using my same Gmail account for the tablet I use on my smartphone, any Google Apps that I have paid for on the phone will download to the tablet for no extra charge. Also all of my contacts on the phone downloaded through the Gmail account to the tablet. I find so far the screen resolution is just fine for my needs. The only con so far is the battery is getting used up rather quickly when I use the tablet and I do not see how I can get 8-9 hours of use on a full charge. I paid $179 for this product on Amazon and I think this was a great deal compared to competitors tables price much more."}

I would still like the added screen resolution the Nexus provides, but am very much a fan of the Galaxy after four months of use. I mostly use it to read books, check e-mail, and for videos. The memory expansion is nice for the latter. Not the best device for browsing the Internet due to the limited 600-dot vertical screen in landscape. The rear camera does a great job for snap shots and you can send them to DropBox. Display is gorgeous. Battery life is adequate. For any Mormons out there, the LDS apps work great."}

I sent it in for repairs, and they emailed me back saying they replaced the software on the device. After about two weeks, the tablet came back. The same day we got it back, it had the same issue it left with... it will not charge/ power on. I have seen a few forums online that suggest this is not an isolated issue. I will say this...the customer support staff are apologetic and they are \"repairing\" it under warranty. My little girl's Christmas present is spending as much time in Texas as it is here at home. I would suggest that anyone considering a tablet (of any brand) do their homework. Research forums and reviews of someone has had their tab for more tha a week.

I stuck a 16gb micro sd card in, which should provide enough space for data storage, but as of yet, I haven't been able to move any apps to the sd card, maybe I just need a different app to do this (as super toolbox deluxe doesn't seem to be able to do it.)."}

It has all the standard features you would expect i.e. ability to download books, surf the net etc. What makes this tablet a notch above is you have access to apps from Google Play but Samsung has its own app store giving you an even bigger selection of Applications.\nIf you like to star gaze, load Google Sky, hold your tablet up to the sky and enjoy how accurate the built in magnetometer inside will display the positions of the objects in the night sky. This also means when you load a compass application it will very accurate as well.\nIt also has built in GPS that is independent of internet service so you can always use your map program.\nAn application that I find very useful is one that comes preloaded and is unique to this Samsung unit.  It's called \"Smart Remote\" and once you set it up you'll have not only a real time TV guide at your fingertips but you'll also be able to control all your video devices from the comfort of you couch.\nWhat is interesting and disappointing at the same time is it has front and rear facing cameras that work just fine and I used the camera a lot on vacation. However, if you plan to read bar codes or QR codes, know that it does not do that well at all. The camera just does not focus in on close objects at all.  So if you plan to do a lot of close up pictures or bar code reading, you will be very disappointed.\nOther than the close up picture disappointment, this is a very nice unit and I would defiantly recommend it."}

It looks like it has never been touched.  Even the user guide still had tape on it.  I already have the S3 phone so the interface is like second nature.  All of my apps came over smoothly,  I can work on my docs in Google Drive,  DropBox sync worked like a charm and I got an extra 48gb of space... Love it.  I was skeptical about ordering something that wasn't new,  but I figured Amazon guarantees the quality of this item and it costs the same as a night out.  Ok.  Who am I kidding? Less.  I'm using it daily; I'll update if I can find a flaw but I'm guessing that won't happen."}

With the tablet being stock I am able to work remotely through VPN/SSH as well as enjoy media. I further customized the tablet by \"rooting\" it. The only thing this does is give you read/write access to system files. After that I was able to emulate video games for most major consoles (I've tested Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Playstation, and MSDOS) smoothly.\n\nI originally purchased the tablet for a vacation that I'm taking. It will enable me to speak with my friends and family while I am traveling. There are a few stock applications that accomplish this but I feel the integrated Google Talk is the easiest.\n\nThere is one major drawback to this device that I found very disheartening: There is no USB or Mini-USB port. I just ordered an adapter for it that will change the charging port into a USB port. The charging cable is modular and it will allow you to pull a USB output port from the power block. This can be used to connect to computers but it cannot be used to connect game controllers, flash cards, hard drives, and anything else requiring a USB input port."}

I was debating on the 7\" vs the 10\" and now wish I would have gotten the 10\"... mostly just for typing and/or watching movies.  I purchased this for traveling and relized I can watch my netflixs movies/shows on this.  Would have been nice with a bigger screen...otherwise, I love this.  Easy to carry around, good speakers for the size, clear screen for games and movies.  I figured I will be purchasing the 10\" in the near future and will get another Samsung Galaxy."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I was looking for something really nice, inexpensive and sturdy enough to take on the go.  The Samsung Galaxy Tab 7  is awesome.  I was looking at the Ipad Mini and the price was way too much for basically the same screen resolution.  I was worried about switching to Android after using Ios on my Ipod Touch, but I've got to say that I really like it better than Ios.  The battery life is pretty good.  The back casing is just a little plastic feeling to me, that's something I noticed, but with a cover, it might be almost perfect.  I don't like the home button built into the screen, I much prefer the way apple has it, but I've gotten used to it and love it!  For me, financially, this has been a great purchase.  No regrets.  When I was comparing the Ipad mini, I found the mini to be really delicate, and that worried me, being that I am taking it on the road mostly.  I'm loving this little device and enjoying it at my $159 price tag.  $329 for the Ipad mini or $159 for almost the same thing?  I went with the refurbished at a local computer center where I live.  I felt that the refurb. version might correct any future probs the device may or may not have.  I'm happy 5 stars."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I chose the Galaxy Tab because it had a higher resolution screen than most other devices at this price point. Overall I am very pleased with the screen and its touch sensitivity. The device performs well for all games and apps that I have downloaded. My only issue is the Samsung port. There does not appear to be an adapter available to send video out. No hdmi, vga or digital out. So, if you're planning to buy it for that purpose, you may want to look at other devices."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I received this as a birthday gift on Thursday April 11th 2013, and it's amazing!\n\nPros:\n. Very easy to setup (especially if you already have a Gmail account)\n\n. Good battery life, on fairly heavy use it lasted me 14 hours but it would last your average user about a day and a half without needing a charge. The battery life really depends on the user though, it depends on things like, screen brightness, apps running in the back ground, GPS and other things being on when the don't need to be. Needless to say you won't have to worry about charging it in the middle of the day because the battery last all day long.\n\n. It's very user friendly and doesn't take very much time to get use to at all, took me about 20 minuets of messing around with it to fully grasp how this device works.\n\n. Very portable! I never really understood how much more portable tablets are compared to laptops until I got this.\n\n. Overall picture quality is very crisp! I've only had this thing for two days and watched at least 20 Youtube videos, mostly music videos and a couple of Netflix shows, all in 720p HD, the display is very bright, I mean dangerously bright and vibrant!\n\n. Super customizeable! There really isn't a limit as to what you can't do on this thing. I love how I can customize the lock screen with my favorite pictures, security features and even the option to write a message on the lock screen. I put my name in the message box just in case it ever gets lost or stolen so there wouldn't be any fuss as to who's device it is.\n\n. Perfect size for me, if you don't want something as big as a 10 inch tablet but still want the screen to be big enough to fully enjoy great resolution quality of your videos and pictures than this is definitely the tablet for you, if you want a larger screen I'd recommend the 10 inch version of this tablet, which I have also used. It's awesome too!\n\n. It has flash support!\n\n. Expandable memory via Micro SD card up to 32GB, I absolutely love that feature! Unlike the I pad you don't have to pay an extra $100 just for an extra 32GB of space, which I find ridiculous. Just order a 32GB card from Sandisk for $20 bucks or a 16GB card for $5 and you're good to go.\n\n. Front facing camera great for skype, oovoo and other webcam apps.\n\n. Runs very smooth with no delays on the touch screen.\n\nMinor cons\n\n. Overall design could have been better in my opinion, it has a somewhat unattractive back cover, that is just kinda bland, but lets be honest here. The fist thing everyone does when they get a smart device is throw a case on it anyways, well I know I did anyways, so this really wasn't an issue for me.\n\n. Like I said before the brightness can literally hurt your eyes if you have it cranked up high for long periods of time, not to mention excessive screen brightness drains your battery a lot faster than it normally would drain.\n\n. Camera Quality isn't the best but it's not bad either, I think it could be a little better but considering the ridiculous bargain price of the tablet and the fact that there is actually even a camera on the thing unlike the Kindle Fire HD it's really not that bad of a flaw.\n\nI personally believed that there was absolutely no way that you're going to get a quality tablet for under $200, man was I wrong. I was dead wrong! Overall I'm very satisfied with this tablet and to be honest, the price is a steal, it's really worth more than what it sells for, I'm so glad I asked for this over the Kindle Fire HD. I had second thoughts before I got it but now that it's here in my hands I have absolutely no regrets what so ever! And as someone who has used the ipad 2, ipad 3, HP touchpad, and the kindle fire HD, I can honestly say with an unbiased opinion that you will not regret buying one of these, or giving it to someone as a gift, they'd love it. I would highly recommend this to a friend, it's a quality device for a low price, doesn't get much better than that.\n\nI'll update this review in the future if any thing else comes up that I think you should know about this tablet before purchasing it.\n\nUPDATE#1\n\nPros:\n\n.You can make phone calls as long as you're connected to WiFi with the Magic Jack app. It's free forever and easy to use also they give you your own personal phone number and voice mail.\n\n. The GPS works fairly well without being connected to WiFi, so it's perfect for use on  the road.\n\nCons:\n\n.The speakers aren't that great. They play loud and clear but both of the speakers are on the bottom of the tablet so if you tilt the device to the side to watch a video all of the sound is going to come from the right or left depending on which way you tilt it. This isn't a major flaw but it noticeable and when you're using your speakers and it leaves an unbalanced sound that I find rather annoying. I just use my Beats by Dre headphones when ever I use the thing so i'm happy, if you have headphones or ear bud's you'll probably find your experience with this device more enjoyable, though they're not needed."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I have two I pads so I am compairing the TAB 2 to what I am use to. I did not want the grandkids playing with the IPAD and possibly breaking it, so I purchased a Galaxy Tab 2 for the kids to use. It looked great and was the perfect size for them. When setting it up the first thing I noticed is I kept hitting the switch by accident turning it off, very annoying. It would probably not be a problem with a case. The next thing I noticed was the touch screen was erratic, sometimes it would work ok and other times it would not. I had to touch the screen several times to insert the typing and sometimes it would not work at at all, this was annoying and troublesome. I had to use my Ipad to type. When I was at a web site, which was not always easy to get to, it did not have the same content as an ipad or computer would have, (TD Amertrade)so it was useless. It is also very slow and sluggish at times. There is no LED light for the camera, so you can only use it during the daylight hours or indoors with a light. I was very disapointed with it because i was hoping to swap over to a Galaxy from the Ipad, I am not a geek and do not feel any loyality to Apple I was hoping to change over to a Galaxy because they offer a Memory card while Apple Ipad does not. This was a rush job to compete with other small tabs.\n\nThe bottom line is that this tablet is for Kids not an adult who needs to be on-line a lot checking accounts, emails and submitting applications. I am going to keep it because I got it for the kids to play games. I plan on getting a Kindle and trying that out as well, if its better than the TAB 2 then I'll return the TAB 2"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "So, this 8GB tablet ONLY has an effective memory of 4GB. I'm not sure what anyone is going to do with just 4GB anymore..?? Also... when I put in the class 10 32GM expansion microSD card, it wouldn't even read the videos OR music from the card or play the movies, so what's the point of being able to expand? And there is NO WAY to move APPS to the SDCARD, so you are stuck. It's worthless. I wasn't impressed with the speed or function either. There was a lot of Samsung BLOATWARE on the tablet as well that took up space and was useless. I would recommend the Google (ASUS) Nexus 7 however. I bought the 32GB version for slightly more than this, and it is OUTSTANDING."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Hi,\n\nI was watching (or trying) to watch some YouTube videos last night wondering why my Tab 2 kept pending the videos.  I thought at first it was my internet connection but then i was able to watch the same video on my Samsung Galaxy S2 cellphone and it worked.  After i tried to use my Tab 2 again and then it went dead.  I thought it was some gliche so i tried to turn it on again using the power button and nothing worked.  I set it aside and went to bed, woke up the next day and tried to turn it on again and nada.\n\nOf course, next morning, i am freaking out now \"hoping\" i didn't get some product that just went ka-put.  I plugged it in to charge and turn it on, again nada.  I went online and saw someone else's instructions that I should hold it for a full 30-seconds....i tried that and it worked!  It popped up the battery showing it totally drained, so at least i felt better knowing it really was just dead.  I had read another review saying they had the same similar problems and they didn't realize it went dead due to the battery getting drained from watching a video or some file they were downloading that just happened to take a very long time, so long that on a lower battery already it just drained the entire thing.\n\nOther than that I absolutely LOVE this thing.  Wish it had flash though....there are some websites i can't access because there is no flash or JavaScript on this thing...other than that i am so glad i got the 7\" screen and not the 10\"....sometimes i feel like i could have even done with something smaller than 7\"....maybe more like 5 or 6\" just because i am a woman and have small hands."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "The Samsung Galaxy tab 2 (SG2) was my first tablet and I bought it based on the preponderance of favorable reviews and affordable price.  Unfortunately I had the problem noted in some of the negative reviews; it would usually not stay connected to my home wifi for more than 10 or 20 minutes at a time.  I have a Roku that never loses connection and when I checked the signal strength on the SG2 (when it was connected) it always said \"very strong\" or \"strong\" so the problem was with the SG2, not with my wifi singal.\n The keyboard function was very sensitive and worked flawlessly but tapping to bring up a web page after a search was very glitchy often requiring multiple taps.  I was initially excited to have the tablet and eager for it to work and might have been willing to get used to the inconsistent tap sensitivity but I failed to convince myself that the connection issue was OK.  I returned the SG2.  It was such a disappointing experience that I haven't decided if I will try any other tablet."}

This little tab is large enough to watch movies, but I do recommend headphones.  The speakers are good...but you won't get really decent sound without headphones or external speakers.\n\nIt's fast, at least fast enough for a guy who just wants to do a little surfing, check email, and watch movies.  Of course, you can play pretty much all the apps/games you can find for an Android device, which just adds to the value of this handy little device.\n\nThe one thing I did find, is that I can't play java based poker that requires interaction with the website...it may be that the flash isn't up to date or I need to install something else, but sites like NLOP or Cafrino won't work with this straight out of the box.  I don't play often, but I do like those sites when I do play.  I'd like to figure out if it's possible to play on this tablet.\n\nOther than that, I'm really happy I made this purchase.

Though I read, somewhere, it's good to let it die completely every 3 months or something. (DO NOT quote me on that however!). If you're putting your baby away leave it with a life of 50-75%. This prevents it from going into deep hibernation, which may cause it to never turn back on!\nRead all this on the Fruit company site.\nI'd recommend this to anyone!\nAndroids are great, many MANY free apps (permissions are a bastard though) and they give you free music like almost every week. Mi likey!\nGot mine early March.

My laptop is too heavy and cell phone too small. A great go between my pcs and cell phone. Hopefully I will receive my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 tomorrow. Based on the reviews I've read I'd figured I better pull the trigger. USB port a plus. I'm holding off on giving it 4 or more stars until I get a chance to test it.\n\n2 weeks later and I love it, I take it with me every where. It slides into jacket or sports coat very nicely too. Apps are plentiful too. Smart Remote is nice I can watch selected programs with the Directv app. I wish I had purchased the Galaxy tablet 2 10\" now lol."}

Definetly Buy the external Micro card (32gb), I got the Kingston Digital 32 GB microSDHC for $21 here. Only thing I thing should have been better designed was where the Micro Card goes into Tab.

Contrary to my expectations, the Touchwhiz UI adds value to Android and the bundled apps are useful. the tablet is ready to use right out of the box, unlike the Nexus 7\n\n4. Jelly Bean!\n\n5. Good battery life\n\n6. USB on the go! I could basically every USB peripheral, mouse, keyboard and thumb drives\n\nCons:\n\n1. At 370gms, it's slightly on the heavier side for people wanting to use it as an eBook reader\n\n2. Screen is low-res which matters on a text-heavy webpage/app\n\n3. Slow processor, but has sufficient RAM to cater to most modern games\n\n4. No HDMI out to mirror the display on to a TV, but supports dlna\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with it for the price paid."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I almost returned this.  I got it for the IR remote, which turns out to be a waste of time.  The provided free remote is very limited.  The play store remote is very very very expensive.  I used the trial, and found out the database is limited.  Most of the devices I needed to control by IR are NOT in their database.  But I would not pay the fifty bucks for it anyway,,,,,,the better remote app should be under $20.  There seem to be only two remote apps for it, the provided one for free, and the squid one...which is too expensive, and as I said, limited in database/devices.\n\nThe IR feature problem, and the proprietary cable connector took off one star.  I would give it three stars but it is such a good value, I gave it four stars.\n\nSetup was frustrating at first.\n\n1) Be careful about getting the Samsung account.  I did not get the registration email.  Their system is not capable for correcting this.  I had to create another gmail account to use it.\n2) Of course, you need a gmail account with payment method attached if you want to use the play store.\n3) Don't bother using the amazon app store, as you need to install the app store app to use anything you bought on the amazon store.  Just use play store.\n4) Tech support is outsourced out of USA and is totally useless, I found.  It should get one star less for the crummy ignorant and arrogant support, but that is the way of the world for an international company like Samsung.\n5) Most apps I use run fine.  Dish, Squeezebox, Kindle reader, cool reader, and many more.\n6) Video app built in is better than most.\n7) DOes NOT seem to support flash, and I could not get it to load.\n8) Works well with the Pogoplug home device.  This allows you to stream video and must, as well as see files on pogoplug device in your home network.  Pogoplug app seems to be ok.  TO stream video you must \"optimize\" video on the pogoplug (it does that itself, but is VERY slow).  Once the pogoplug optimizes the video, it will play on the Galaxy fine.  You can get pogoplug cloud storage too, cheap, and have all your stuff in the cloud if you can;'t get to your home network stuff.\n9) Video and audio quality during playback are fine.\n10) Touch screen is very sensitive, but good.\n11) You can get spare cables from amazon.  Including a cable that converts to female usb connector.  I think you might be able to use usb flash drives with this.\n12)Many cases or covers available.\n13) Battery life is ok.  Depends maily on running apps that constantly stay on to access network stuff.  You need a task killer to effectively kill these when not really using them.\nOverall for the price, an excellent value.  Worth the extra bucks over the cheaper nasty tablets.\nRecommended, overall."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I would like to start by saying that I live in the caribbean and this is the second tablet that I have bought from Amazon ( the first being the original Kindle Fire). What I didn't know when I purchased the Kindle Fire was that the apps, e-books and amazon instant video are only available to customers in the U.S. (even though we are allowed to purchase books with the normal Kindle from our country, Trinidad). This is not case with the Galaxy Tab 2. You can download apps, watch Netflix(this comes pre-installed) and play games with other opponents online immediately after the registration process is complete.\n  The volume button and the power button is well placed, even though the power button should have been a slide toggle switch rather than a push button toggle switch, to prevent it from accidentally activating (helpful when playing 8 ball pool), while you are turning the tablet for an alternate view. Its pretty loud even though I think there should be speakers on the sides when watching the tablet in landscape mode. There is a universal remote app which works fine( this also comes pre-installed on the tablet). The camera quality is a little poor , then again it is a 3.15 mp. The battery life is ok once not under heavy usage. I opted for 7\" cause it fits easily in big pocket clothing, like cargo pants and track pants. And you can't beat a price like $179.00 for an android based tablet. A good buy!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I've had my Galaxy Tab 2 for about 5 days and have thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a perfect size for reading. Easy to hold with one hand. I don't feel like I'm giving up much with a smaller screen. I bought a moko slim fit case and 32gb card to go with it and they were both good purchases.\n\nWhat I wish I had known:\n\n-the external SD card can only store music/video files, not Apps. So you will still be limited on app space on an 8 gig tablet (really only 4 gigs after android system). Still, I have all my apps on it with plenty of room (about 3 gigs still remaining)\n\n-the device charger won't well through other USB outlets. I don't know if it's proprietary or a voltage issue. It will charge while plugged into a comp USB port if the tablet is asleep, but not while being used.\n\n-the cameras (front & back) aren't spectacular, but are acceptable for the low cost of the tablet.\n\n-Amazon doesn't currently have an app to watch instant video on Android devices (you'd have to get Kindle Fire for that)\n\nUPDATE 7/1/2013\nStill enjoying the tablet. My only complaint is that the battery life is not spectacular. It gets the job done and is usually enough to make it through a day (or two of light use). But heavy usage does not last as long as an iPad."}

I have an ipad 2 and a Lenovo Ideapad in my household, so that is what I am comparing it to.  I like the screen, very nice display - YouTube was crystal clear when I played it.  I felt the touch screen was very responsive, for the most part. No better or worse than my other tabets.  I found setting it up was very intuitive and that downloading apps would be simple for a person who is not used to that type of thing.  Since I own tablets with larger screens, I was concerned that I would hate the smaller screen.  But I felt that if I had to go with something like that - it wouldn't be a problem.  I may use a stylus on a screen that size at time, but it didn't feel like it would have been as big of an issue as I originally thought.  All in all, for my limited use and set up of the item, I feel like if it was my product, I would have been happy with it."}

Once I turn on the tablet,  I see more of myself and my background than what is actually being displayed on the screen.  When I try to do anything on the tablet I get an eye and headache.  This is so annoying as it defeats the purpose of the tablet.\nI am hoping I can locate an anti-glare screen protector for it.  I really don't want to have to buy such small item online as the shipping cost to my location would not make this feasible\nI think it is a user-friendly tablet as I haven't as much as browsed through the manual and I am able to get by with it.\nI gave it 3 stars because of the physical pain experienced when using this device.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "This the second android based tablet that ive purchased and ive been had again. The first though it was used hardbricked afeter three days after I upgraded it to ICE CREAM SANDWHICH with the official site download. This time I buy a brand new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\" 8gb for $179.00 thinking that this was a steal veruses a ipad mini. Yes I am apple biased when it comes to phones but I like android for tablets. Well I just went to the store and picked up a 8gb micro sd card because I already ran out of space. Low and behold the tablet sees it and mounts it but guess what? I cant put anything on it. Not apps not movies not pictures nothing. Its a wasted feature because so far Samsung decided not to support this feature on this tablet. So ive downloaded three diffrent app to sd apps. None work. So I looked on line at support forums. Nothing. So far there is no option to support this feature. So I basically have a breand new 8gb tablet with no more space and a brand new micro sd that isn't even supported by the tablet. Im hoping for a future update for this tablet so that I can move things to the sd. Forgive my ignorance for any one that has over come this issue. This review was written on March 27 2013. So this may not always be an issue. The tablet it self is good build quality and has a nice screen though obviously its no where near retina or hd. Its nice for the price. A good tablet for surfing and Netflix and such. Decent with some games but can chugg with some graphically intensive games even with the memory cleared. I would buy another one of these or even the 10\" version if they fix the sd card support. If not then its not worth it if you plan on downloading more than 8gb worth of stuff. I am apple for life and maybe next time I will just save up and get a really nice android tablet or an ipad. For now im very frustrated with the limitaions of android."}

I was looking for something portable yet big enough to read ebooks and do basic web/email and watch videos.  Considering the price and options to add android apps, I decided to get this tablet over Kindle.  It's an okay tablet but not great.  The screen gets dirty faster than the two mobile devices I have.  It's not as vivid as apple products for sure.  Micro SD card expansion is somewhat misleading as the android OS that comes with does not let the tablet to store apps to external SD card.  There's just little over 4 GB space available on internal memory and that's just not enough.  I have some basic apps downloaded and no game apps at all.  And I already filled up more than half of what's available.  So if you're planning to download many apps and videos and magazines, 8GB internal storage is not enough at all.  The expandable micro SC option looks great as if it'll add more storage but it does not work that way at all.  Apps will not be stored in the external SD card at all.  The default apps come with the tablet cannot be deleted and just take up space in the limited memory space.\n\nAlso it says it's compatible with Adobe Flash Player.  Adobe apparently has discontinued Flash Player support for newer android OS and this tablet does not come with Adobe Flash Player plug in and does not work.  So that's also misleading.\n\nI hope android will provide its OS updates in near future with an option to store apps to external sd card.  So will adobe with its Flash Player."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "It's an okay tablet. I purchased this because my itouch's home button is broken and the screen is all cracked (I put a tape over the screen to keep it from going into pieces). As I am writing this review, I am still using my itouch since it loads faster and the keyboard/screen is easier to use and works faster than that of the galaxy tablet. I am not an apple fanatic or anything (I think this brand is a little bit overrated) but I still see myself reaching for the itouch than the tablet. Of course I am happy that I can finally read my ebooks since the tablet is more advance than my 2nd generation itouch. I know I am talking more about the bad stuff about this tablet (and I am going to do it some more) but this tablet is not bad for the price. One of the things that I don't like the most about this tablet is the screen, it rotates so slow and sometimes I have to click on somethings a few times for it to respond. And the keyboard response is also hard to maneuver and use, sometimes I will have to type a letter a few times before finally getting the right letter. I don't know if buying this tablet refurbished matters but it shut down 2 times on me now, and both times while I was on instagram. Also, I think it will be nice if this tablet has an extra home/power button. Since my itouch home bottom broke I've been using the power button to turn it on, so i think it is very useful if this tablet had a another button to turn it on as backup when the power button breaks or something. Okay/good tablet but I think I will buy myself a laptop or another itouch."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I purchased the seven-inch Galaxy Tab 2, with 8 GB storage on board, and an SD memory card with an additional 32 GB.  Of the 8 GB on board, only about 4.5 GB were available, because of space needed by the OS and by preloaded applications.  I thought I would be well off, until I discovered that you cannot install anything to the memory card.  That is, you can't install applications there or move them there.  It's true that you can load your own videos or music there by using perhaps file transfer from your computer.  But the apps have to be able to recognize data there.  Direct downloads to the device will usually go into on board storage.  Only a few apps are set up to write their data where you wish.  For example, you can stream your Amazon MP3 music from the cloud; but if you ask the Amazon app to download any of your items, you have no choice as to where they will go.\nAs I understand it, this is a limitation of the Android operating system, and has been true for the last few versions.  And there is apparently no way around this.  So this is not the fault of Samsung, but it certainly reduces the appeal of the Galaxy Tab 2, which is otherwise an attractive and well-performing unit."}

I really had no problem with the minor adustments to this OS. You go to google play, buy or rent movies, buy TV shows etc. Very similar to Itunes. BUT, I sold it because 8gb is not nearly enough to store apps and video. Sure, there is an SD card slot. But, for what purpose? You cannot store apps and copy protected media on your SD card. Songs can be stored but they are not the data usage problem. Songs take little space. I sold the Tab on Craigslist and bought the Nexus 7. WOW! The display is as good as my Ipad and the 16gb built in is plenty for me. They are readily available at Staples, Walmart, etc. I really love this little Nexus for 199! Ipad mini will be 329!"}

The tablet exceeded my expectations.  It has an intuitive interface and thus easy to use, compared to non-smart cell phones.  It has a clear, sharp, and readable display, even for my old tired eyes.  The tablet has a reasonable performance for the price, but I never owned a tablet, so I am comparing it to notebooks and lap-tops that I use.  There were some comments by other reviewers on the camera, but I cannot comment on it, since we did not use it.  We have other good compact digital cameras that are versatile enough for all of our photography needs.  I strongly recommend considering this little package for recreational Internet surfing.

It is perfect for a person like me who is a full time student and worker, who is going to school for information tech. this open source system with the endless amounts of possibilities has totally blew my mind. Never did I think I could afford a tablet with this many options which is too many to list. My must have in tablets and phones these days is the option to have sd or micro sd card and still Im shocked how many types of tablets don't offer that. This tablet can play your movies, games, roms, and has the potential to develop your own app or write source code( something I'm doing in school). The only thing that I didn't check was that was only wifi so newbies like me you need a good hotspot or internet connection. I would recommend getting 4g lite and wifi that is the only problem I have found so far. love this product"}

I use it 98% as an e-reader, though I do occasionally do some light web surfing and/ or playing games or videos.\n\nThe battery life has been acceptable, though when in a high light environment (i.e. outside) or with heavy wifi use the battery life does suffer.\n\nI would recommend ordering a case at the same time you order the tablet, as I didn't do so, and while I was waiting for my case to come in I dropped my tablet. Of course it landed face down on the concrete on my front porch. You guessed it, I now have a crack in the glass on the face.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I love it soooo much, I have been going to bed two hours later than I should every night 'cause I'm having so much fun with it.  It plays every video format I have thrown at it including .MKV--on the app that comes with the device.  I've put magazines and books from the library on it.  I still prefer the real thing, but I do like knowing that there are 14 magazines and six books in my purse at any given moment should I find myself in need of distraction/time-killing.  It does suck that it doesn't come with a manual, but nothing really does any more.  I keep wondering what I am missing out on, but what I've figured out so far has been pretty great.\n\nNow I come to the reason for leaving a review.  When you're looking to buy this, you might do what I did and get a 32GB micro card, a multi-format adapter, and the best case for how the tablet will be used.  By all means, do just that.  I did, and I don't regret it. There is one more thing to do.\n\n******BE SURE TO BUY AN ADDITIONAL DATA/SYNC CABLE!!******\n\nSeriously, get one now!!  When you need one due to loss, damage, or accidentally leaving it at work over the weekend (as I have), you WILL NOT be able to readily buy one.  Target doesn't have them.  WalMart doesn't have them.  Radio Shack will tell you when you call that they do have them, but when you arrive to purchase, you'll discover the kid on the phone had no idea what he was talking about.  Then you'll remember seeing a Sprint commercial for this device, and will go there.  You will point to the cable on the display tablet and tell the really nice guy trying to help you, \"I need a data cable.\"  He'll stop cold and say, \"I don't think we have those.\"  And they don't. Honestly, if the one on their display model goes out, they will have to order one from Samsung (or Amazon, of course)  If you're lucky the really nice guy at Sprint will offer to lend you his for the evening.  (Just throwing that in 'cause I thought it was waaay cool)  You will eventually find one at the Verizon store several miles up the road.  They want 30 bucks for it.\n\nSo to ensure the fun continues and doesn't spiral into a weekend filled with despair, angst, and price gauging, GET ANOTHER DATA CABLE NOW!!\n\nAs I am writing this, they are available on this site for less than six bucks."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "To start I have an iPad2 so I am not sure if that is a fair comparison to this particular Tablet. This Tab is much faster than the iPad and handles Flash. That is where my likes for it end. I have to use a Stylus pen in order to type and email or surf the net with this Tab. I find using my fingers (I consider myself to have average hands) is a pain in the rear. Again I am not sure if it is due to the size of the screen or if it is just this Tab.\n\nThe iPad2 is far more responsive than this is hands down. I purchased this blind (not playing with it in a store) which is rare for me. I like to see things in person prior to buying just for this reason. I won't return it b/c it will do as long as I have a Stylus handy. I would not buy this one again nor would I recommend it.\n\nFor the price of this one I guess the theory of you get what you pay for is in order. I would much rather use my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone over this."}

Size and weight are perfect; not too big to be unwieldy, but big enough to be useful for getting things done (unlike my smartphone, a Samsung Epic 4G Touch).\n\nThe only downside I had was with Samsung's version of Android (with TouchWiz); the stock firmware leaves a lot to be desired in terms of performance.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Let me start off by saying, I am an Android fan. I own a Samsung Galaxy S II phone and am eagerly looking forward to buying the S IV once it is out. So, when I got the Galaxy Tab 2 (7 inch) in a deal on purchase of Samsung 46-inch Smart LED TV I was pretty excited about it. However, upon using it for a day or so, I had no choice but to return it for a refund.\n\nThe Wi-Fi receiver is extremely defective. It needs the signal to be at full strength to open web pages. If the signal drops even to 3/4th of full strength, it won't open the lightest of web pages (e.g. Google). It will simply show \"loading\" and will eventually time-out. I did some research of my own and found a number of hits for \"Galaxy Tab 2 Weak Wi-Fi\", one of the first links is actually an Amazon link: http://www.amazon.com/Did-they-ever-fix-WiFi/forum/Fx2OE7QX73W89HA/Tx2WVDVZLKXZDGM/1?asin=B007P4VOWC and the answer to that question is NO. Then you have the \"death grip\" issue - hold the tab on the bottom left corner (where the Wi-Fi antenna is located) and see the signal strength drop before your eyes. I even tried following some of the suggestions which point to adding the Wi-Fi network manually instead of auto-detect and that did not help either.\n\nFinally, I had to call up Amazon tech support, who were very helpful but they basically ran through the same set of troubleshooting tips I mentioned above. They also pointed to the death grip issue and the manual network addition. They also mentioned that the Wi-Fi problem was a known issue with Galaxy Tab 2. As a result, I had no option but to request a refund.\n\nThe only reason I gave a 2-star rating is because I didn't \"hate\" the product. For someone who is willing to ignore the Wi-Fi issue, this is a fantastic product. For me, I can't always be standing next to my wireless router. In my opinion, it kind of beats the whole purpose of having a tablet and a wireless router, especially when my iPad 2 can do a much better job at receiving signal and rendering web pages at more than acceptable speeds. And it is 2 years old!\n\nDisappointed."}

And I wanted the extra storage capacity. I shipped the unit back to Amazon today for several reasons, but the biggest is that the screen gave off an unbelievable amount of heat somewhere in the 1+ hour range of video watching. It was just weird - at first I didn't know what was going on because I have the Nexus and the Samsung Tab 2 10\" and neither have this problem. I had noticed battery life isn't nearly as good as the Nexus but I didn't track that very closely. The heat, though - let's face it, if a unit is giving off heat, that means the battery is draining at uber speed. Plus, the screen should not be emitting heat - not in a small tablet, or even a big one, for that matter. I searched the Net and saw the issue mentioned in some other Samsung devices - phones, mostly, I believe. Make sure to check this out before ordering. The Galaxy Tab 2 7\" feels flimsy next to the Nexus - which I now love even more than before. Sometimes extra weight is good - it means the product is made well with good materials - and will last longer. I like my Samsung Tab 2 10\" very much - this also accepts a microsd card so I guess I'll be using that when I need more storage. In short: buy the Nexus 7, not the Galaxy Tab 2 7."}

I was told it had a mini HDMI port, but it does not.  So I went online to look for some kind of adaptor.  Samsung makes an adaptor, but it does not work with this tablet (it appears to work with all the others, though.) There is no such cable that works with this tablet.  I have been told by Samsung tech support that the only way to do this is you must have a TV or DVD player with a program called Allshare to stream from it.  I happen to have a Samsung Bluray player with Allshare, so I tried to stream through that. After an hour with their tech support, doing everything they told me to do, it still did not work. Also, this does me no good at all when I am traveling and want to hook my tablet up to a hotel tv to watch a movie.

The Android app store, though lacking in some places, offered many choices for PDF annotation (what I use to take notes) but to anyone who needs this for PDF annotation purposes, look no further than the free Adobe Reader app. The functionality and interface is perfect and the app I paid $4 I deleted after a few days.\n\nThe tablet is perfect for watching videos and playing games, as well as taking notes. I wish I would have bought the larger, 10.1-inch version, though, because 7 inches is just a little on the small side for taking notes.\n\nThe touch screen is iffy at times if you use a stylus - I would suggest springing for a nice one with a large pad. My cheap stylus sometimes doesn't register well and can make writing illegible. I have tried using my cheap stylus on my roommate's iPad, though, and it worked well - it's clearly the Tab's touch screen that is the problem.\n\nOverall a good tablet, but I would suggest students purchase the larger version."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "My wife got a Galaxy Tab 2 through a deal at her work.  Cool!  This seemed like a great device for watching movies and checking email while traveling.\n\nAfter working with it for a while, I absolutely hate it!\n\nMy expectation was that I would connect the UBS cable to the PC, and I can see the tab directory structure, and move files back and forth.  No such luck!\n\nTo connect with the PC, I needed to install Samsung Kies.  Piece of junk!  Once in a while I can get the tab to connect via UBS, after several reboots of the PC, but most of the time the computer doesn't ever recognize it.  The tab says that it's connected via wi-fi, but there's no indication on the PC that it's connected, and apparently no way to push files over wi-fi to the tab.\n\nMail works, but open wi-fi is so rare that it's not much use.\n\nThe few times that I got a movie installed they played well (using an external app: MX Player) with good picture quality and adequate sound. My wife hears it ok but I had trouble with the volume sometimes even with noise-cancelling headphones.\n\nIt mostly lies in a corner gathering dust, until every 3 months or so my wife wants to use it for a short trip.  I then fight with it for hours, sometimes getting movies installed, but mostly just getting frustrated by the crappy interface. Then she takes one of the laptops.\n\nIf you think you can use this device, let me know and I'll sell you this one cheap.  Otherwise I might just stamp on it, then go try an iPad."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\" for $180. I was not pleased with the screen res, the build, the Android version, proprietary apps, . I have a smartphone with an HD display (Razr HD)and it looks great. After using the Galaxy for a few I noticed how badly the pixels stood out everywhere. I could not get past the non HD display, it's ugly. After one day of use it also seemed to run a bit slow and had a few other minor quirks. I knew I would not be happy with it for the long term\nAfter some additional research I switched to the Nexus 7 and I am very pleased to have done so. The display is beautiful. It runs better with the better processor and Android 4.2.2. All Google all the way is perfect for me.\nIf you buy a Nexus over a Galaxy you will be giving up the camera and SD expansion slot.\nI am able to live with this since I have way too many cameras already. I also do not store a lot on my devices so 16G will be adequate. There are also ways to stream music and video from a flash drive using app Nexus Media Importer and a USB OTG cable.\n[...]\n\nSo, the Nexus is much a nicer tablet for only $20 more. If you are debating between the two, now you know where I stand."}

The downfall came when I was using the web browser or doing anything with the keyboard. Several pages wouldn't load and the keyboard isn't as reactive as I'm used to. There was a definite delay.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "This review is on the Samsung Galaxy Tab2 tablet but as the Android OS is the only OS choice I must consider OS issues as a part of the overall review. Samsung has done an excellent job making this quality tablet for a good price. The quality of the materials and finish are excellent. It gives me a high degree of confidence that this will work for a long time and provide me real-world usefulness. Onscreen typing compared to smaller devices is good. Thumb typing is very easy to manage with this size and actually it's easier to be accurate.\n\nThe larger screen size is a huge improvement over smaller smartphone sizes screen for everything, especially photos and video. I think the 10\" screen model would be just as useful if you need bigger but this 7 inch model is very mobile and still fits in a pocket. The screen resolution is very sharp and crisp but not useable in direct sunlight at all. Keep the brightness turned down to get the 4+ hours of battery time. The processor is quick to load and refresh for Internet browsing. Zooming and moving around standard websites is quite acceptable, quick and easy to do. The 32gb micro card accessory included provides lots of storage.  Using the \"two finger\" touch and squeeze motion makes zooming in and out very easy. The one finger flicking to move around pages includes acceleration with faster flicks and stops on a dime with a soft touch. Streaming video content such as an HD streaming movie is awesome and quite adequate. The speakers sound surprisingly good. Streaming via WiFi is as fast as my desktop anywhere you have a WiFi connection.\n\nIf you're thinking you can use it for office software, it can be done to a point but still no contest to a desktop or laptop. The facial recognition method to login needs lots of light to work well. It comes with the Polaris Office app that has wordprocessing, a spreadsheet, and presentation software. It does recognize Microsoft file extensions but not macros. It also has built in GPS. Downloadable Google maps of the USA stored locally on the devices storage makes turn by turn directions available without the WiFi connection.\n\nI do think the onscreen keyboard needs to be more like a real keyboard. At least put the @ on the main layout. When typing a web or email address the keyboard wants to insert a space after every dot, so a backspace is necessary to remove extra spaces for it to work. As my very first tablet ever, and as a very first time Android OS user (not a smartphone user), I am quite pleased with the device overall. Getting proficient on the operating system is a big challenge because it comes with very minimal documentation and help systems."}

I have 3 reader programs, kindle, kobo and nook on the tablet and they're fine but each time I try the fix for Adobe Digital it gets blocked out.  I have tried various fixes including contracting both Amazon support and Samsung support with no real remedy.  For that reason, although I enjoy many of the features, I am using my old Kobo ereader for travel reading and using my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 for a few games and books I purchase for kindle, nook and kobo  I'm considering the new kobo glo as I do like the feature of being able to read in the dark and I know that the kobo will get Adobe digital, even if I have to use the fire wire to do it.  The Samsung Galaxy Tab was not a good purchase for my needs and cost a fair amount of $, I wish I had returned it when I first discovered that issues."}

I used to have an older flavor or android on an older sprint phone, but at that time, Android wasn't really ready for prime time.  This system fits the bill, but...I can say the screen is not as responsive as the iPad's.  The skype app - not sure if it is the app, or the device - but the cameras don't always work, and I have to rotate from landscape, to portrait, to landscape again for it to work.  and sometimes the audio doesn't work.  i've loaded and uninstalled and loaded it back a few times.  Doesn't seem to make a difference.  Also, I'm not sure the widgets area at all useful.  I find myself going to the app-view to really find stuff.  Also...Samsung loads A LOT of bloat-ware ...which I can't uninstall and will never use.  The other rub about this is you can add a 16GB microSD card, but you can't store apps on it, so there is only a finite number of apps you can actually load on 8GB.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "This is my first tablet device. I wanted something affordable (but not from some unheard-of mystery manufacturer) and this seemed ideal. At the current Amazon price ($180) I think you'd be hard pressed to find anything better. For that kind of money I wouldn't lose too much sleep if something awful happened to it...I'd just buy a new one! It might not be as high-spec as a $500 device, but it does the job. Minor complaint is that the cord on the charger is a little short, which is a pain if the battery's dead and you need to use it while charging. My only other gripe is that a lot of TV streaming services work only in \"landscape\" format, with the tablet held horizontally, but the speakers are on the bottom edge, so stereo is impossible! The sound all comes out of the right hand side!! I'm sure this probably applies to most (perhaps even all) tablets, but it's a really dumb design mistake in my opinion. On a similar note, it would make sense to have the volume control reversed when using it horizontally...so that you press the left hand side to lower the volume, right hand side to raise it. Maybe someone at Samsung will read this review and take note! :-)"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "*** The Positives:\n\nWhen I powered this thing on... What a beautiful display!! It is lovely.  No wonder S^MSUNG is taking over the TV display market.\n\nThe Android operating system is the best.  I guess I am personally biased toward Android because the HTC Incredible got me hooked on the simplicity and openness of the OS.  From the main screen there are five panes you can access with a slider, if you are familiar with how the Androids operate.\n\n*** The Negatives:\n\nRight out of the box, I had a sinking feeling when I saw the other end of the USB charger/data cable had a S^AMSUNG connector on it instead of a micro-USB. I can see it now.  I go off on a trip and I have not packed that specific cable for the Tab. I can't get that cable at Target or Radio Shack!! I have to get it from... S^AMSUNG. It will not get to me from S^MSUNG before I have to go back home or go off to the next destination of my trip. If I had wanted stupid charger/connector hassles like that, then I would have gotten an Apple iPad with it's confusing array of which-generation-connector-goes-with-which-generation-iPad conundrum. OR I would have gotten a BlackBerry Playbook (*giggle*) where the Playbook insists on having the charger's data pins shorted to permit the power pins to charge the Playbook's battery! I kept that sinking feeling about the Tab pushed down in my heart, because I was trying SO HARD to rationalize being able to keep this neat device with it's beautiful display.\n\nNext con: When the Display Brightness is set on \"Auto\" the display is constantly set to be too dim for whatever the lighting conditions are. Manually adjusting it is easy enough, but why can't I set it to *automatically* adjust to how bright I want it to be? Also, when the Display Brightness is set to \"Auto\", whatever the Tab does to set the backlighting down to it's too dim setting, well that just makes the backlighting flicker. It's annoying!\n\nThe con that broke the camel's back: The micro-SD card would not stay in the micro-SD card slot!  Was it the plastic-snappy-hinge-door that was supposed to keep the micro-SD card in place? It didn't. If I put some finger pressure on the closed plastic-snappy-hinge-door while my 32GB niblet was in there, a display at the top of the (beautiful) screen would say \"Preparing SD card\". But the instant I took my finger away from the plastic-snappy-hinge-door, the status at the top of the (still) beautiful screen would tell me that the \"SD card was unexpectedly removed!\"  When I called the 1-800-SAMSUNG support line to resolve this problem the troubleshooter did determine that I had not installed the card correctly. I had not pushed the micro-SD card in far enough. HOWEVER, to push the micro-SD card in far enough, I would \"have to use a gemclip or a safety pin to carefully push\" the outer edge of the micro-SD card into the Tab deep past the plastic of the slot until it went \"click\". I successfully tried this and the micro-SD card worked in the micro-SD slot. An optimist might say, \"Well! Now that you have that there micro-jobber clicked into yer hoo-hah-hole just right, ya might never have to mess with it ever again! :-D \" To which I say ripping movies for long trips, transfering other bits of data, video and pictures to and from the Tab is going to be a constant battle with micro-SD micro-card micro-slot micro-surgery with the S^MSUNG-recommended \"gemclip or a safety pin\". (For younger readers: The \"gemclip\" is an archaic metalic wire device old-timers used to use to hold paper documents together before the \"floppy disc\" came along. The advent of the \"floppy disc\" in the late 1970's and early 1980's effectively banned the easily magnetized \"gemclip\" from the office because those \"gemclips'\" magnetic force would erase devastating amounts of kilobytes from the said floppy discs.) (Also for the younger readers: The \"safety pin\" is another metallic wire device used in the 1950's and 1960's to cinch the waist of a cloth diaper onto a baby's butt.)  I guess I was just hoping to be able to change micro-SD cards with my standard-issue hands, the way I do with my phone, camera, handheld scanner and every other device I use that requires memory! Every time I go on a trip, I will not think to pack a gemclip, nor shall I pack a safety pin! I don't even have these things from 3 to 6 decades ago IN MY HOUSE! AND I'M A BIT OF A PACKRAT!!!! So... I micro-extracted my micro-card, went to my Amazon account and clicked \"return\".\n\nBottom line: Beautiful display, but there are a lot of gaffes in the Galaxy Tab's design which were going to be so annoying in the years of ownership to come.

This one was at the top of my list, so when I got this one for my Mom for her birthday, after using my husband's at home, it was a no-brainer.  Very nice, quick responding tablet.  No glitches so far.  I still use my laptop, but now I also use my husband's tablet. If you sync it with your existing google account, you can get your emails, notifications (fb, twitter, etc) on it and clear them out instead of your phone and both will sync so you don't have to do it twice.  Pretty sure you can do that with any android device.  It's just nice to be able to do that.  Enjoy.  I would buy another Samsung android anytime."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I received this remote as a package deal with a Samsung Plasma I also bought on Amazon.  The tablet is a sturdy build.  If you've seen or owned another recent Samsung phone or tablet you'll feel at home on this device.  Its not as plasticy as the newer Samsung phones.  The screen has a slim bezel but not so slim there's nothing to hold onto.  The screen does attract fingerprints on the black bezel but there's a white model floating around if that really bothers you.  It runs a recent version of Android 4.1.x which gives it the performance updates of \"Jellybean\" Android.  This model is also the GT-P3113 version.  This model has the integrated IR repeater in the side of the unit. It also comes preloaded with remote control software.  Its a neat idea and as a remote its much more useful than what $200 bucks will normally buy you in the custom remote scene.\n\nI did purchase the 8GB model.  It only has about half of that usable after the OS is loaded.  The advantage of the Samsung over other models (Asus Nexus 7) is it will allow for a 32gb micro SD card to be plugged in the side.  You can store all sorts of movies on 32gb and then swap them out as much as possible.\n\nThe screen isn't \"retina display\" crisp, but it also doesn't cost what an iPad costs and the iPad Mini doesn't have retina display anyways.  I only mention that because inevitably someone will look to compare the two.  If you're already bought into the Android ecosystem with an Android phone this a great addition.  If you have a Samsung TV or really any TV that has published IR codes you can impress your friends a family with your new cool Samsung Tablet remote control.  If you want a versatile e-reader with the huge Android ecosystem back-end, this device makes much more sense than a Kindle Fire HD or Nook HD.\n\nIts a great device and at $200 or less it's a steal."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I wanted a tab that I can carry in my purse/messenger bag. Most of the things I use are android products kindle, nook, hulu, HBOGO, my Google account, netflex, internet explore. My only issue is it doesn't have a a lot of storage space if you down load aot of apps you can easily use up majority of your memory. I purchased a 32 gb micro SD card so it should help. Next time I will diffidently get one with more memory. Other than that I honestly love it. The screen resolution is fantastic I have watched a few of my tv shows on it. Oh and the speakers..Samsung gets a bravo for the speak quality. The sound blew me away for a tiny unit it packs a punch (there are two speaker slots on the bottom portion of the devise.

They all work well but they all have limited battery life so I bought the tab.  Samsung in general makes solid devices and this is well built but one big thing that sold me is their help line.  If you have questions or problems a quick call gets a actual person and assistance.  Not too knock Google or ASUS but calling either about the Nexus 7 is a nightmare.  For pure horsepower go with the Galaxy Tablet 7.0.  Its older but more powerful.  The second and most important things is too ROOT your devices and that includes phones and replace the stock ROM with a custom ROM.\n\nThe good:  Decent performance overall.  Mini SD slot.  Good build quality and rear facing\n  camera.  Great speakers.  Great customer service.\n\nThe bad:  8gb of internal storage?  C'mon Samsung start with 16gb.  Average screen.  No\n  mini USB connection.  It uses a proprietary Samsung connector.\n\nComparison to other tablets:  The Nexus 7 16gb or 32gb.  The Nexus 7 has a beautiful screen\n  that is sharper then the Galaxy.\n\nShould you buy it?  I'm on the fence and I like Samsung in general.  If the Nexus 7 had better customer service, sure.  Google problems with the Nexus and you'll see.  If you buy the Galaxy via Ebay or otherwise you get 90 days warranty.  Nothing with the Nexus."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Amongst my family members, we have the ipad mini(which I own), nexus 7, and galaxy tab 2.  Though not mine, I would rate the Samsung as the best deal.  It's by far better than expected.  Very Apple-like with respect to function and aesthetics.  I use Macs and the transition to the Tab 2 would be easy-- more so than going from a Mac to a PC.  I like the keypad feature with numbers across the top of the letters, which means you don't have to shift to access numbers.  The word suggestion feature includes several possible words and is displayed in a row above the keypad.  I find this much more comfortable to use than a pop up suggestion box.  The screen is clear and colorful, similar to the ipad mini, and doesn't have the dull resolution of the Nexus 7.  The Tab 2 also includes a document and spreadsheet app which is it's own version of word/excel.  The sound quality of music played is not as high as my mini.  Out of the three small tablets, I would recommend both the Samsung and Apple, as both are similar in quality and function.  The Nexus 7 would rank in a below category-- not worth it's full price, and the quality does not attain the level of the other two.  This device has changed my view of Samsung products for the good."}

The device itself and the features are great.  Please note if you are thinking of using a stylus pen with it, that it will **not** work with the pens that are for use with the Galaxy Note series."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "After comparing the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 to the IPPad Mini at retail stores, I decided that the Galaxy was a better purchase for me.  On sale, it is half of the price of the IPad and, except for maybe a better picture quality on the IPad, is an excellent product.  I did have a bit of trouble with the volume on apps going silent, but the matter was easily settled by going online for support. (It was just a setting that got \"goofed up\". In fact, I liked the Samsung Galaxy Tab so much that I purchased a second one-this time for my husband.  I would advise anyone who purchases one to get the extra memory. Also, battery time does not last like it is stated to do, but with some setting changes, and complete \"power offs\" when not actively being used, lasts sufficiently."}

It's lightweight and easy to use. A great product for the price."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "This is a great 7inch tablet.  I just wish it came with more that 8GB of storage.  I have added a MicroSD card but google play and music and other apps all store things on the internal memory.  Samsung has a great interface they put on over the android which is very useful.  Based on my experience with this tablet I think my next phone purchase will be a samsung (currently I am using a motorola droid bionic).  Battery life is reasonable, the only downside is it doesn't use a microUSB to charge - but that hasn't been a huge issue.  The size is great because I use this tablet at work for many things and it fits in the back of my pocket when I am walking around (just remember to take it out of your pocket when you sit down)."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Samsung is a force to be reckoned with in the android market. I have purchased a Nexus 7 which has a much smoother user experience, and a beautiful design, but it does not beat the Samsung Tab 2 7 and here is why:\n\n1. The Samsung device allows for removable sd cards. This takes away all of the storage issues that tablets have. I have a bunch of digital videos and music that I can watch or listen to just by swapping out micro SD cards. Granted Samsung should have given the device 16GB of internal stroage instead of 8GB, but the micro SD cards make this a non issue.\n\n2. Unlike the other 7\" android tablets like the Nexus and the Kindle this has a camera on the back which allows you to take decent videos and pictures. The picture quality is pretty good, but not great (I consider my iPhone 4 great in this area). It makes the tablet a very handy device for when you are traveling and want to take pictures and videos. I use it to shoot videos for my children when I am in Europe on business trips. This feature piggy backs on reason 1 listed above becasue you can save your video and pictures directly to the micro SD card.\n\n3. It has excellent video playback, gaming and web surfing.\n\n4. You can use it as a remote control for your TV and Cable Box. I can not tell you how liberating it is not to have to look for a remote control.\n\nThe only thing that the device is missing is an mini hdmi out, and the reading experience could be a bit better. If you are buying a 7\" tablet to primarily read e-books then go with the Kindle Fire HD 7\", but if you want a full fledged device with full access to the android ecosystem then go with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\". The Nexus 7 has a cleaner design, and much better user experience (swiping is effortless) but they hobbled the device by copying the iPhone model of not allowing for external storage, yeah... yeah.... yeah I know about USB OTG, but it too clunky to have something sticking out the bottom of such a small tablet.\n\nThe bottom line is that this is the best value in 7\" tablets!"}

First, it is supposed to be an 8gb tablet with expandable memory up to 32gb. Nearly half of the pre-loaded 8gb was taken up by apps I didn't need, wouldn't use, and couldn't delete. I could have dealt with that since I purchased a 32gb SD card. However, I soon discovered that even downloaded apps can't be placed on the SD card - only content.\nI had also planned on using the tablet for reading documents and doing some minimal editing. The word processing program on the tablet is very difficult to use and has extremely limited capability.\nOn the positive side - listening to music, reading books, and watching video on the Galaxy were all easy and enjoyable. The Galaxy was definitely made for entertainment.\nBottom line - if you need an upgraded version of an e-reader, then the Galaxy is a great option. If you need more space and functionality, look elsewhere."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I was torn between the Galaxy Tab, Kindle Fire HD, and Nexus 7.  I consider this the best purchase I've made in a while.  Got it refurbed (in perfect condition) for 159 from Amazon; also saw it was $159 refurbed on Walmart, and saw it later at my local Costco for $189 new with a few accessories.  There were things I liked about all the tablets; what it came down to for me was that the Galaxy Tab has cameras on front and back, expandable SD storage, unlocked Jellybean, and the refurbed deal.  I had actually decided on the Nexus 7 over the Kindle Fire HD when I walked in to my local Best Buy and picked this tablet up.  I found its form factor to be excellent and the tablet was responsive.  I hadn't heard much about it previously but it came into the mix and in the end won out.\nOverall:  5/5 - It's thin, light, easy to hold in one hand, it's weaknesses are less weak than others, and it's just an all-around solid tablet.\nBattery - 4/5 - Has lasted at least 5-6 hours on every charge so far, if not longer.\nDisplay - 3.5/5 - This is probably its biggest weakness.  It's more than adequate, but it won't amaze you.  Both the Nexus and Fire HD have it beat here.  It won't blow you away but it does what it needs to.\nProcessor/RAM/Speed - 4/5 - Doesn't have the greatest specs, but it runs smooth on Jellybean.  All apps I have tried work fine, rarely if ever a force close.\nSpeakers - 4.5/5 - I wasn't expecting much out of the speakers, but was pleasantly surprised.  They get plenty loud without sound tinny.  Not much bass, but they're great!\nAccessories - I do wish it had the normal USB chargers as I already have a million for my phone, but the battery lasts long enough it's not a worry.  I recommend the TechArmor screen protectors, around $8 and easy to put on.  Got a case but it's not here yet.  I haven't got an SD card yet.  I don't plan on taking a whole bunch of pictures or anything.\nIncluded Apps - The peel smart remote is cool!  It's better than my cable remote for sure.  Takes about 30 seconds to set up.  The included Samsung App store is worthless, just stick to Google Play.\nGreat tablet!  Buy it, no regrets!"}

I heard the new ones display ads !!!\n\nI also had a 10.2\" tablet running Android 2.2 that I used as an eBook reader, this is an el cheapo from China, works well for what's is designed for but SLOW and only 3 hours battery life. But I never had ANY issue with this one for the last 3 years. Still running very solid. It just did not have WIFI. Internet cable is OK and allowed me to browse the Internet.\n\nSo, I decided to buy this tablet, small, long battery life and very easy to operate. Everything is smooth on this one.\nI search for a free PDF reader, download it and now I can read all my books in PDF formats.\nActually, I took the microSD memory from the 10.2\" tablet above and stick into this new tablet. It sees all my books right away.\nConnecting to WIFI is no brainer, I get into the Web within 5 mins using it.\nPinching to zoom is a nice feature to have. (all iPhones had this feature).\nThe protective pouch is also supplied as well as the charger. The pouch is a it too tight, sliding the tablet in it is not too difficult, but pulling it out require significant skills and strenght.\nI swap the pouch with the one used by the Kindle eBook reader. It works perfect both way, my wife is happy with this new pouch for her old Kindle as it is thinner and more sturdy.\nThe new tablet well worths the money."}

Overall we were happy, but since day one I noticed it charged too fast (compared to my Nexus 7). I really didn't think about it much until the battery just started dying. We would plug it with about 20% battery and 2 min later it would say 100% charged. Of course I would unplug it and sure enough the battery was not charge. Fortunetly I am returning this one and getting a refund. Since my daughter really liked her tablet I will get the same model once more and hope it was just bad luck.\nI prefer my Nexus 7 (feels more sturdy in my hands) but Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 with all the little extras (skins, UI and camera) on top is a very close second for me.

I've only had it for a few days, but I am so impressed with this tablet, I had to write a review. I'm impressed with the ease of use, and quality.  Getting apps and widgets from various sites was a breeze. I'm anything but a tech wizard, but this was so easy to operate. I consider this a very user friendly tablet, and the features on it are fantastic. My friend has a Kindle Fire and he admits, this unit blows his away in alot of ways. Beautiful graphics, and the layout of functions will make it easy for anyone to operate.\nI couldn't be more pleased. I would highly reoommend this to anyone, you won't be disappointed.\n\nUpdate: Week 2 of ownership.\n  Thought by now I would find some issues that I didn't care for, but I am more impressed the more I use it. I can't find one single thing I don't like.\nOne of the quotes they advertise on Samsung's webpage is, 'I DIDN'T KNOW IT COULD DO THAT\" and I'm finding that to be the absolute truth. If your looking for a smaller, easy to carry around tablet, look no further. A few family members have the Apple Ipad mini and we compared the two side by side and I could not tell any difference between the two, and being the Ipad is twice the price, why would anyone want the Ipad. The Samsung is amazing. Watched movies, TV shows, read books and searched the web flawlessly. Great graphic display and ease of use.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I love this tablet! I purchased two right after the new year and they have been going strong since. Maybe that seems crazy, but I've heard some horror stories about off-brand tablets becoming crap within a few weeks. This tablet has a lot of internal memory and runs android. The battery keeps its charge well, and I haven't had any issues with playback of movies or music, and it plays apps perfectly. I have probably downloaded approximately 20 apps and the system hasn't slowed at all. The WiFi works well, when I take it away from home and come back, it is almost instantaneously picking up the signal. It almost never loses the connection, even when my ps3 or my laptop do.\n\nIf you are looking to buy a tablet and you aren't sure which one to buy; decide what you want it to do first. Are you working or playing? Are you familiar with android or mac? Android is super easy to use, and the app store is very extensive, with tons of free apps. You need to decide how much you want to spend, long term. Apple products may be top-of-the-line, but they are priced accordingly, and so are their warranties, if you want one. Even after your initial purchase, you will still have to buy a case, possibly you might need a memory card, or a replacement power cord, and you might not want to pay $50-100. If you decide you want to go with android, now you have a variety of choices. Your first consideration should be WHICH version of android you want. This Samsung runs 4.1.1, but I've seen lots of off-brand that only have 2.1, and that OS came out a few years ago. The higher the number, the newer the OS and the better your tablet will work, and run apps especially. I don't recommend the 2.1, I used to have it on my phone and you can't save apps to external storage. At the very least, look for 2.3. There's also the kindle to consider, they run a certain android OS that has been modified for Amazon, and has exclusive rights on new adobe flash software. This is a definite perk for the kindle, but it was still out of my price range. Plus, while it can be so upsetting to miss out on the random flash ads (haha), the Samsung still plays videos from the internet just fine, as well as several different kinds of video files downloaded from a computer to the external card.\n\nAfter looking at the OS, you need to decide how much internal memory you want. The literal total for the Samsung is 4.49 gb. Of which I still have 2.90 gb free. Now, I am using 1 whole gb for apps, but I mostly play games and they can be large, and when you have this much memory, you don't have to constantly move them to your external card. I could potentially get a lot of that space back if I wanted to.  Having enough internal memory is VERY IMPORTANT;  you will want to throw your tablet in the street and crush it with your car if you don't have enough. It will constantly tell you that the storage is low, and you won't be able to even update your current apps. I would say, depending on your usage plans, you will want at least, AT LEAST,  2 gb, but even that's on the low side. If you are going to read, play games, and be on the internet a lot, you will want more.\n\nNext, decide how big you want this sucker to be. I love this 7 inch tablet, and I wouldn't want a larger one. Yet again it depends on what you want it for. I like that I can just throw this in my purse or school bag. The 10 inch ones are too big for my tastes.\n\nAfter these major considerations, here's the other thing about tablet buying that you may want to think about. My girlfriend received an off brand tablet for Christmas, and we looked, and looked, and looked for a good case for it. Nada. There are so many different tablets out now, a saturated market, while the accessories are about as easy to find as water in the desert; if you don't have a Kindle, an iPad, or a Nook. This may sound crazy, but in the end, what made me get this tablet was the fact that I could get a good, solid case made specifically for it, at a reasonable price. I was not going to spend several hundred (I bought 2, remember) dollars on tablets, only to break mine within a week. I'm a huge klutz, so I have to think ahead. This is a great tablet, I highly recommend it!"}

It is an excellent tool for carrying your email accounts, review and edit your documents, etc. Finally the Galaxy Tab 2 tablet is superior to anything hitherto had handled. Perhaps because the only thing that would change would be for a 10 inch but not if it would sacrifice my galaxy tab 2 7 inches usefull. I can take the trouble to wherever and not hinder me at all. Maybe it's something that can not be said of the 10-inch ... Excellent!!"}

I wanted something bigger but not too big. It came down to this, the kindle fire or googoe nexus. The real capper was that the nexus and fire do not have expandable sd card storage but the galaxy does, and up to 32 megabites. My music and pictures are all on sd so the choice was obvious! Other than that it has so many features and is very intuitive.  I wish apps could be transrerred to sd card though but for general playing, surfing the web, email,taking pictures and movies,  music (the dual speakers are pretty good too) this is excellent and a tremendous value. It does seem to kind of eat battery power a bit but maybe that's normal."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I purchased one of these from another vendor which has no impact on this review.  I got to know it and really loved it.  It is a HUGE step up from the Kindle.  I was never able to register it on the Samsung Web Site due to numerous bugs.  I have the SD card and USB adapters which expand the capabilities greatly.  The manual is very thorough and complete compared to most.\n\nAll was well until 1/2013 when I turned it on and it stated that it needed to do an update.  It gave no information as to what the update was, it just assured you that your data and settings would be saved.  After about an hour it completed and rebooted.  I didn't even recognize it.  All my home screens were wiped clean and it's touch controls were a completely different layout.  My apps were still there in the app drawer is all there was from my original setup. Searching the web, a number of people had stated that Samsung pushed an Android upgrade to 4.1.1 which did the same thing I experienced.  Sure enough I was at a different version of Android, so tried emailing Samsung but there was a web site bug there too, you cannot find this model in the email form and cannot send if you don't.  So I called Samsung Support to find out how to get the manual for this version as the one on their web site was for the version I purchased 2 months earlier.  They said they don't have one and have no idea if one is coming but I would be emailed when it becomes available.  How's that for customer support?!\n\nI don't mean there are a few cosmetic changes, EVERYTHING changed, browser, home screen layouts, where to find notifications and settings and now all the home screens were split.  I had to search the web for tutorials on how to use 4.1.1.  They are of some generic help pages, but every manufacturer tweaks Android a little.  So good luck if you get hit by this upgrade.  Samsung will not be there to help you in any way.\n\nUpdate 4/2013 - finally the manual which goes with this Android Upgrade pushed to these devices in 1/2013 is now available on the Samsung Web page/support for this model.  When I contacted support at the time of the upgrade to ask about a new manual to go with this version, they said I would be notified when it came out.  NOT.  It says it was posted February 2013, which I know it was not.  Maybe March.  It brings to light a lot of the Samsung modifications/customizations made to 4.1.1."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Unfortunately anyone considering this device should Google-search the term \"Issue 36993:  wifi no longer working in ics 4.0.4 \" or simply \"galaxy wifi authentication failed\".  Essentially at this time you may find yourself without any option to connect to the internet. In other words, a pretty useless paper weight.\n\nThe various forums have several threads on the topic where users, including IT professionals, who own android devices are reporting the problem and not finding a solution or work around. Typical posts from the above read:\n* \"just signed a 2 year contract. Had I known about this issue I never would have committed my two years to this device. Now Im stuck.\"\n* \"I am too extremely frustrated that for $700 i have a piece of plastic doing a half job... simply unaccceptable.  Google needs to push some kind of update ASAP and start treating the android project seriously...\"\n* \"Huge problem!!!! Bought 2 galaxy 3's and a galaxy tab 10.1 2 all with no ability to connect WiFi!! This is unacceptable!!!\"\n\nA bug in Android, introduced in v4.0.4 and persisiting through the latest Android v4.1.2, prevents android devices from connecting to many, mainstream, wifi routers. If your home/office router is one of those, tough luck.  Users have these routers working fine with all non-android devices (ie iOS, Windows...). Also, many Galaxy devices (including mine) worked fine up to the v4.0.4 upgrade.\n\nPersonally I had been an advocate of the Samsung Google product family.  However the lack of networking functionality, and lack of communication by these companies in the several months of this issue persisting should be unacceptable and potential consumers here should be aware and beware."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I started looking for a replacement for my 2 year old B&N NOOK Color a couple of weeks ago. One local store had the Nexus 7 and this Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. Another store had the Acer Iconia A110. My choice was between these 3. I will begin with the one that I first rejected.\n\nNexus 7 - The Nexus 7 was perhaps the best compromise of the 3, but the large number of reviews on many shopping sites that described problems and poor support from Asus and Google made me eventually eliminate it. I liked the better screen resolution and the speed with the quad core processor, but no microSD slot and the reported problems and failures kicked it out as a choice. I didn't want to take a chance of getting a bad one and I didn't want to have to open it up to fix loose screws and such.\n\nAcer Iconia A110 - This one could have easily been my final pick, but the screen knocked it off. Just a relatively small amount of offset from straight on and the screen dimmed. It not only dimmed, but the colors also changed, which I read is common with TN screens. My 2 year old NOOK has a better screen in my opinion. It had the same quad core processor as the Nexus 7 and the same lower screen resolution as the Tab 2 7.0, so it was in the middle as far as those attributes. It also has a microSD slot.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 - The Tab 2 falls short of the Nexus 7 in the processor and screen resolution. However, the Quadrant score is not that much slower than the Nexus 7. In one review site comparison, the Nexus 7 had a quadrant score of 3501, while the Tab 2 had a score of 2840. After loading all of my apps, I ran Quadrant twice and the lowest score that I got on my new Tab 2 was 3131. Not enough of a difference to matter. I found rooted NOOK Color reviews and they got Quadrant scores of around 950, so the Tab 2 is a big improvement over that.\n\nThe Tab 2 has the following advantages over the others:\n- The screen is better than the Acer and even slightly better than the Nexus, even though the Nexus has a better resolution.\n- It has the memory expansion that the Nexus doesn't.\n- It has the best speakers by a small amount.\n- I managed to get it for slightly less cost than the other 2, but that didn't factor in my choice.\n\nSo far I really like this tablet after only using it for 2 days. My microSDHC cards and OTG cable adapter haven't arrived yet, so I haven't been able to check out the functionality of those. I've loaded Firefox and side loaded Flash 11 and that is working fine with Jelly Bean. AirDroid works fine for transferring files over my wifi network. Even though I don't plan on using the Bluetooth capability, I will have to pair one of my headphones to see if it works.\n\nSome people like the simpleness of stock Android, but I actually prefer the added features of Samsung's Touch Wiz. I'd prefer not having the added Samsung apps, but I will just have to ignore them. I don't want to root the tablet, as I will probably just brick it.\n\nOnce I check out the MicroSD and OTG cable when they both arrive in a week or so and check Bluetooth, I will update this review. So far I'm happy with my choice of 7 inch tablet.\n\nUpdate 2 days later: I mated my old Motorola S305 stereo headphones fine and they worked with no problems. I discovered that I had a long unused microSD - 256MB. I plugged it in and tried to load some photos using AirDroid and AirDroid would not find the external card. A Google search found that this is a problem with AirDroid with Jelly Bean, so not a tablet problem. I installed the wifi file transfer app and was easily able to transfer files to the external card. It's not quite as nice as AirDroid, but it works fine. I'm still waiting for the microSDHC and the OTG cable.\n\nUpdate 5 days later: I received the microSDHC and OTG cable. No problem with either. I used to OTG cable to mount a USB flash drive and a mouse. Both worked with no problem.\n\nUpdate 7 days later: I almost forgot about the GPS function. I just turned GPS on for the first time and loaded the GPS Status app. I'm impressed. It quickly (about 1 minute) found and locked onto 16 satellites while in the house. By comparison, my HTC Incredible 2 phone found no satellites in the same time and finally locked on to only 9 before fluttering between 7 and 9. I don't think that I have ever seen either my old Droid or my current Incredible 2 ever get near locking onto 16 satellites, even outdoors."}

And it's half the price of the ipad and in my opinion much better. You can do so much more with an android than anything else. I've found that the smaller 7 inch size is much easier to use. The only complaint I would have is that they got rid of the options and search buttons that were next to the home button, depending on the app you're in the options button could be in a different place everytime. I don't understand why they would do that but I guess it's just something you have to get used to. One cool feature is that you can control your tv with it.

I wanted to be able to read and watch movies on the plane, read at the beach, check email occasionally and check my favorite websites. And I wanted to be able to do all of this without lugging around the books, magazines and a laptop for the whole week. I used to have an android phone so it was all very easy to figure out how to use. I chose the Galaxy Tab from all of the android tablets out there for 3 reasons, 1-Samsung makes a good product and 2- the external microSD storage and 3- for use with my SmartTV.\nThe built in memory is only 8GB so I threw in a 16GB microSD and (foolishly) thought I basically have 24GB of memory. Here comes big drawback number 1... the external memory can only be used for pictures and videos taken with the built-in camera. There is an app that will allow some apps to be saved to the SD but I was hoping I'd be able to download movies to the SD. I'm going to assume its my fault for not researching that further before purchase. Maybe there is a way to do it and I haven't figured it out yet but I kinda doubt it. I was able to download 4 movies to the device but when I went to install a game I purchased I found I was out of memory.\nBig drawback number 2- with the Galaxy Tab you have the Samsung App Store, the Google Play store and the Amazon App store to find your entertainments... the problem is the 3 of these combined are woefully inferior to the selection available from Apple Apps & iTunes (especially for movies & magazines).\nMy lesson learned: I shoulda coughed a bit more cash and bought an iPad mini. And if decide that I really do need a tablet on a regular basis then that's what I'm going to do.\nIf you're on a tight budget though and these drawbacks aren't a big deal for you then you can't go wrong with this device."}

This is my first tablet, and my main usage of the tablet consists of light gaming, web-surfing, reading (e-mail and e-books), and the occasional movie trailer on Youtube.  The display is good enough for its size; while the HD displays on the Kindle Fire HD and Nexus 7 are preferred, they are more of a novelty than a necessity for me.  The option for the external storage is a big plus as well.  It allows me to not bog down the already limited internal memory, which is about 5GB user accessible.  Not to mention, the recent upgrade to Jelly Bean 4.1.1 gave a nice bump in overall performance.  The sound quality is nothing to write home about, but it suffices.  I usually get about 8-10 hours of usage out of this, with wi-fi usually turned off while I read.\nFor what it offers, while not the best or ground-breaking, the Tab 2 delivers a good entry-level tablet experience."}

The package arrived 2 days later (I'm on Amazon Prime) in wonderful condition. The shipping box as well as the original box were undamaged. The original box was also adequately protected.\n5/5 for shipping.\n\nNext I'll talk about the device.\n\nI've looked at a few other reviews, and I am confused as to why people complain about certain features. (such as the quality of the speakers, which aren't even that bad, or other various complaints over details) seriously people? It's a $200 Tablet that I find rivals other Tabs hundreds of dollars more than it. With this Tablet, you get what you pay for AND more.\n\nPerhaps my favorite feature is the external SD card (WARNING! THE EXTERNAL SD CARD WILL NOT STORE APPS. Due to piracy and licensing, apps on tablets are restricted to internal memory only.) despite not being able to store apps, I find the memory card suits my personality. I am a movie watcher and enjoy watching movies anywhere I go when I have free time (Road trips with family, doctors appointments, long lines at the college bookstore hahaha) thanks to my 32 GB SD card, I can have more than enough movies to keep me busy.\n\nI won't bore any readers with technical lingo and phrases describing the processing power and so on. Just know that this Tablet won't disappoint! (Unless you have unrealistic views on how far $200 can really go)\n\nCall me biased, but I would give this Tab a 5/5 and day of the week! Definitely worth the price :)"}

It seems to have quick response.  I have been fasicnated with tablets since they first came out, but,with a 3 computer home network, including 2 laptops, and also a smart phone, I jsut couldn't justify spending $600 plus on a tablet that I didn't really need, plus a monthly cell service for it.  So, I settled on this $199 wi-fi only tablet.  I was already setup with Samsung and Google through my Galaxy SII phone, so this tablet was easy to learn and setup.  I find the display quality very good.\n\nI plan to use the 32gb micro sd I bought with the tab to store my music and pictures on.  The reason I chose this over the Kindle Fire was because of the ability to expand the memory with the micro sd, the Android OS, and the built-in GPS.  I have not used the GPS yet, so I will add to this review if I have something significant to add.  Even with the kind of bulky case I got for it, I can put it in my big purse.\n\nI teach a computer class at our local Senior Center and I like to stay up on the latest gadgets available so I can help others with theirs.  This would be a great beginner computer for somebody.\n\nWith no trouble at all, using the Smart Remote app that came on the tab, I had it setup to control my TV, satellite receiver, stereo receiver, Roku, and 2 Blu-Ray players.  Very cool.  I love how I could re-install apps I had already installed on my phone on play,google.com to my new tablet.  If the app says 'installed' click on it, then it will tell you if it is compatible with your new device, and you can install it to just the new device.\n\nI have not tried the camera yet, but I didn't buy this for the camera.  It probably doesn't take as good a picture as my phone or digital camera, so I'm not worried about it.  It would be good enoug to video chat on.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about this tablet is the propritary plug in for charging.  I will just have to carry this plug with the tablet I guess.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who doesn't need to connect to the internet when not near a wi-fi, and wants a nice functional tablet at a very good price."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "(I've also put this review under the Kindle Fire HD)  I'm not one to typically write reviews but since I spent a long time researching the right tablet for our family I thought I'd give my opinion.  First, the main use for our tablet was for the kids to play apps (fun and educational) and watch movies/shows.  I wanted to be able to download movies/shows so they could watch them on the plane or if we didn't have wifi access  I also plan to use it for books for them and me.  I have other Apple products but didn't want to spend the money on something that the kids would primarily be using.  With that said I narrowed my purchase down to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and the Kindle Fire HD.  I actually bought both and tried both for a few days.  I read many reviews and most said to go with the Galaxy.  BUT, in the end I liked the Kindle Fire HD much better and here were my reasons:\n1.  I thought the screen quality was better on the Kindle Fire HD (it is amazing!!!).\n2.  The screen size was a little wider.\n3.  The interface was much more user friendly with the Kindle.\n4.  I'm a big Amazon Shopper and it just made more sense to go with the Kindle plus I plan to keep the Prime Membership up after the trial.  Like that you can borrow a book a month, get free streaming of tons of shows and movies, free 2 day shipping), lots of free books.\n5.  Supposedly there are many less Amazon apps than on Google Play but this has not been an issue with us at all.  All the apps we want are available on the Amazon store.\n6.  The big seller for me was the 16 gb internal memory versus 8 gb for the Galaxy.  Also, in reality the Galaxy only has 4 gb internal memory because half it taken up already by the operating system and other stuff that is loaded that you can't delete.  I do understand that there is the option to get an external SD card and in fact I have one but, FIRST, you can't store any apps on it only photos and movies, SECOND, it is a royal pain to transfer stuff to the extSD Card (you have to plug the tablet into the computer, transfer the files onto the computer and then put them back onto the tablet into the extSD card section.  Weird!)\n7.  So, even though the Kindle Fire HD with 16 gb is really only about 13 gb I like the fact that it has almost 3 times more internal memory\n8.  The Kindle felt of high quality build.\n9.  I have family members with the Kindle so we can share some books (not as many as we hoped but still a neat feature).\n10.  Battery Life better with the Kindle Fire HD.\n11.  Sound better too with Kindle.\n\nSo, these are my 2 cents for what it's worth.  I liked the Samsung Galaxy but I loved the Kindle Fire HD for what we wanted to use a tablet for.  Happy shopping.  I don't think you will be disappointed with either one!"}

If you go the generic route, even if the product boasts a 1.5 ghz processor, you're likely to be disappointed with the performance. You will not be disappointed with the Galaxy Tab. It's what a 7\" tablet should be. It's fast enough to be useful. It can multi-task well. It's small enough to fit inside a purse or larger jacket pocket.  It has good battery life and an impressive screen. Get a drop protective cover for it, and you should have a functional tablet for at least 2 years."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I was one of the early adopters of the Kindle Fire who got caught up in all the hype. It didn't take long for me to find many things I didn't like about it, but I won't mention them here. After giving it away, I decided to get the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. Believe me when I say that it was a major upgrade. Electronics are just one of many things that I'm very picky about.\n\nHaving played with a few other Android tablets, I think that Samsung makes some of the best Android tablets. They also previously listened to their customers, and no longer mess with the stock OS.\n\nPros:\n\nDepending on how you use it, the Galaxy Tab 2 has a very good battery life (TV shows/movies will drain the battery quickly).\n\nThe screen is very bright and has excellent color.\n\nIt's a great deal for the price (it's actually dropped in price since I bought it).\n\nCons:\n\nSamsung forces you to have a few apps that I'm sure most people don't want (Next Issue, for instance), and you can't delete them.\n\nThe included cable is too short. They don't even make a longer aftermarket cable, so I have to use a USB extension. I also think it's stupid that the Samsung cable is almost an exact copy of the Apple cable.\n\nOverall, this is a great tablet, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a quality Android tablet.\n\nEdit: It seems that a longer aftermarket cable is actually made for the Galaxy Tab 2. I should've searched again before reviewing."}

When I got it the screen did not look like the one they describe and did not have the screenshot icon as shown in all the pictures and video's.  I had to tap and then double click everything to get it to open and even then things didn't always open. I also had to use two fingers to get it to scroll up and down or to the next page.  After seeing the tutorials and reviews on how it should react I was very disappointed.  I talked with Samsung and they were not very helpful.  They would tell me to hold the home button and the task manager would open. If I held the home button a voice would come on and tell me to double tap...when I did that and held I only got a google search, not the task manager.  Everything they told me it should be doing, it was not!!  I sure hope this isn't a change that my replacement will come with.  If so it will go back as fast as the last one.  I have a Galaxy S3 that I love but the Galaxy Tab 2 I got was very frustrating!!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Recently there was an article in the \"New York Times\" cautioning buyers of tablets to try them in the store \"hands on\" before making a decision. When purchasing my Galaxy Tab 2 I didn't. I also was not paying much attention to its features (or lack thereof). Here is what I have learned after three month's use.\n\nThis is my first tablet and for the most part I think it is terrific. Because I have an aversion to Apple's business model and because I have found that the many Samsung products I own are of excellent quality, the Tab 2 was my obvious choice. In addition I have three year's experience with the Android OS and expected the learning curve to be substantially shorter. It was. The 7\" screen is the perfect size. I can't imagine how I would navigate the 10\".\n\nWhat I wish I had been paying attention to are:\n\n1) This tablet was engineered for right handed people. This makes perfect sense since most of the world is right handed. Unfortunately I am not.\n\n2) There is no<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-2-7-Inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B007P4VOWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi)</a>&nbsp;flash which means that for all practical purposes snaps are limited to those taken in bright light. Goodness knows there is plenty of room on the back of the unit for a flash.\n\n3) The buttons on the right side are a design disaster. The top one turns the screen or the tablet on and off. Right below it is a rocker switch to control the volume. Their feel to the touch is exactly the same. Good luck on being able to tell instantaneously which switch your finger is touching. The obvious answer would have been to put the On/Off switch on the top of the tablet.\n\n4) The socket for connecting the tablet to the world or the charger is on the bottom. If you plan on lying in bed with the tablet in the vertical position resting on your belly it can't be done without seriously bending the cable. There seems to be plenty of room on the left side of the tablet.\n\nI purchased the Samsung 2 7\" Wifi Tablet in November. I am reasonably happy with my $199 purchase. Because there are now so many choices at the lower end of the price range it means that it is going to be more difficult to give them a hands on try. That being the case, make very sure you can return your purchase if you try it out and are disappointed.\n\nGood luck - but caveat emptor."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "My first tablet was Acer A500 10 inch tablet.  It still runs well but I'm starting to find the weight was starting to bother my wrist after extended use.  I have checked several 7 inch tablet models (Apple, Nexus 7, IBM etc.,) and decided to take chance on Samsung 7 inch tablet.  Because several early reviewers have posted issue with battery/charge problems, I have hedged my bet by ordering from Costco due to its very generous return policy of 90 days.\n\nAs tablet goes, set-ups are pretty straight forward, I activated Google and Samsung accounts and the tablet was set to go.  As others have already noted, this tablet comes with paltry 8GB of internal memories with half of it already taken over by bloatware.  It can however, take 32GB micro-SD card so that helps to store your video, e-books any download you will inevitably do.\n\nSome reviewers have complained of having issues with wi-fi connectivity depending on how you hold the tablet.  I have had no problems here.  Signal reception was excellent both at free wi-fi spot at Kaiser Hospital and my home wi-fi network.\n\nAnyone who have owned android smartphone and tablets should have no problems playing around with this toy.  The screen is veritable fingerprint magnet so I have ordered screen protectors which I will apply as soon as it arrives.\n\nIf you try to read in bright sunlight....well, good luck.  But indoor, it is pleasure to use.  It may not have the best screen but I found it more than adequate when compared to my old Acer 10 inch.\n\nBattey life is not the best.  If you do not have power-saving features on and you have wi-fi enabled, you can almost see the battery drain noticeably.\n\nIn closing, I picked Samsung 7 inch Galaxy Tablet 2 for its low price, ability to accept external memory card, decent screen and light weight.  I am not a power gamer so not having the latest CPU is not an issue for me.\n\nIf I have issue with battery/charge down the road, then I will do an update.\n\nUPDATE:  03/05/13\n\nI've noticed that on some website, Samsung installed browser may give you problem with accessing.  If so, install another browser like Opera portable and access problem will go away."}

Now with a major OS update the unit is just plain a pain in the ass to use!  It often freezes up and all my previous apps have mysteriously disappeared, so i had to reload them back.  The main reason I purchased this was the expandability option using a micro sd card.  This in itself is a pain to use because it takes quite a while to read the card.  The list of negatives can go on and on: wi-fi is terrible (and i have a new router and fast internet) the battery time is poor-can only watch two 90 minute movies before it's drained.  The keyboard is slow and frustrating to use and I'm not impressed by the screen resolution.  Why did I buy this, because of the glowing reviews here on Amazon. Guess it's going on craigslist."}

I am very pleased with this tablet, even though I don't use it because it was a gift for my girlfriend, but she loves it as well.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I am a professional piano tuner/technician and I wanted something to be my \"administrative assistant\" as well as a tool in my toolbox.  As a tuner I use specialized analysis software to verify my work and needed something portable.  I got that and more.  Not only can I use my software with this, but I can even use it as an accurate a440 tuning fork, if needed.\n\nWhen two of my children's offbrand tablets malfunctioned within the warranty period and that other manufacturer wouldnt even answer the phone, we bought two more of these samsung units to replace the offbrand units.  The children love them.\n\nWe use them for e-readers, using kindle app, fbreader and adobe reader.  We use them for offline gps with gps copilot. We use them for educational purposes with multiple language and drawing apps.  I use mine for work both as a toolset and administrative assistant.\n\nThe biggest drawbacks we have found so far, other than having to use power save mode all the time and gps causing fast power drain without external power, come from android 4.1.1 and are generic to all units running this release, but are only minor issues. IIRC, samsung has already released 4.1.2 in several countries but continues to hold north america to older software.  Android no longer allows for the moving of apps to the expansion card via settings and app developers have yet to \"pick up the slack.\"  On apps that can be manually modified to do so, config files have to be found and corrected and relevant folders have to be manually moved.  This isn't something the average user wants to be bothered with. Jelly bean 4.1.1 seems to want to reboot on rare occasions that appear to be with moving large quantities of files, and it is difficult to remove bloatware, requiring a 3rd party app that can perform \"rooted\" tasks or can bypass that need. One samsung specific quirk that I don't like is the proprietary usb connection on the device.  If the usb cable messes up, it will be a pain to replace it.  This also limits connectability flexibility when trying to connect to devices with a micro usb slot.\n\nPros:\nDual cure processor, 1gb ram, 32gb expansion\nLightning fast gps tracking, bluetooth, wifi\nE-reader compact size\nFunctional flexibiliy\nEconomical price\n\nCons:\nMust be run in power save mode AND airplanemode for optimal battery performance\nEven with external power, the gps function will slowly drain power.\nAndroid 4.1.1 specific glitches and bloatware.\nProprietary usb slot on device\nStorage limits for the technically illiterate.\n\nSummary:\nGreat unit with just a few drawbacks that can be worked around.  Biggest drawbacks are usb slot/cable, battery consumption when using gps or communications features and issues specific to android 4.1.1 that will hopefully be fixed with the eventual update.  But if you tend to download a lot of apps and don't want to be bothered with manually configuring them to use the expansion sd card, then you may want a different unit with 64gb of internal storage instead.  However, if this unit withstands the test of time then I will be extremely pleased."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "This Galaxy 2.7 tab is unreliable. I would NOT have bought it if I knew then what I have learned by owning it and experiencing its limitations and trying to do the tasks needed for surfing the web. It chooses to put an unwanted space between the first and second characters I type in the 'web search field'.  The touch screen and keyboard are unresponsive. Highlighting and copying text or web addresses is a nearly impossible chore of hit and miss frustration. The on-screen keyboard is either 'in its own way' or blocks the the area necessary for web page navigation. The on-screen keyboard has no forward or backward arrows. But the tech told me I could buy a micro USB keyboard that does have those arrows for 79.00 from Samsung. Warning me that it better be from Samsung because no other keyboards are compatible. Content sometimes is blocked or covered by an unwanted advertisement that I can work around on my PC and laptop but is impossible to overcome on the android with the controls that the device subjects me to. I am returning it because the problems I have experienced are compounded by very bad Samsung tech and customer support. It blocks content that I easily get on my laptop or PC. When on a chat page with a Samsung tech it locked up three times and had to be rebooted. The on-screen field that the Samsung website provided me was so narrow I could not see the text as I typed my responses. His answer was to \"reset it to factory specs\". Same answer as the last two times that the Galaxy started to malfunction. In fact that seems to be the only answer Samsung techs give. So now it's on its 4th factory reset and guess what? It's no better.  Glitches seem to happen a lot with this tablet and not just while surfing. I find myself putting the Galaxy aside and finding other ways to accomplish my desired tasks and I am beginning to avoid using this hand held computing convenience. I have been spending too much time finding ways to bypass its limitations, and  I resent its attempts to force me to do things 'its way', and still failing in the process. In a single phrase the Samsung 2.7 is \"Big Brother in a Tablet.\" Thanks to Amazon for their generous return policy so I can be free of it. It's going back tomorrow.\nJan 27, 2013 Follow up: I have purchased a Nexus 7, 16 gig tablet for the same amount of money I paid for the Samsung galaxy 2.7. So far the Nexus is superior in every way that I have used it compared to the Samsung Galaxy. The Nexus has better WiFi capabilities, a much more responsive screen, and it anticipates what I need to do and is always ready and able to accomplish what I wish it to do; and does it in such a capable way that it brings a smile to my face and appreciation for its intuitiveness. I cannot say that for the Galaxy 2.7. I would urge anyone that is considering buying a 7 inch tablet to avoid the Galaxy 2.7 and instead purchase the Nexus 7."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I have had my Tab 2 7.0 for about 2 months now and I'm loving it. Although I can see the appeal of the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1,(my husband has one) I just love my 7.0. It is just the right size to take with me everywhere.(After I slipped on my cute MoKo 360 Rotating Case, of course) I just popped in my sd card and logged in to the Google setup, and my Google Play account did the rest. All my apps from my phone downloaded to my tab.\n\nThis tab is fast and efficient. I am still discovering the cool things it can do. Like connect to my Xbox and play pics and videos through it wirelessly! Whaaat!? I love using the Overdrive app to borrow books from my library. My daughter gets to play games when we are out and I have access to all my docs with Google Drive. I have a lot of apps on my tab and I still have almost half of my 8gb of internal storage left. I was stuck between the Nexus and the Galaxy and finally opted for the Galaxy based on back camera and expandable memory.\n\nThe screen looks great. Sound is pretty nice for the size of the speakers and it is super fast on the internet even when using bluetooth tether. Imagine my surprise when one day I turned on my tab to find the Jellybean update for Samsung waiting for me. I swear the tab is slightly faster and the display is even crisper now. There is only one thing that I would love to make this tab even better. Flash for the back camera. Speaking of Flash I was able to download an older version of Adobe Flash and now I can go to any website that still uses Flash. Good old Google Search, you can find anything!\n\nSamsung and Google have not disappointed with this easy to use and quality built tab that does not break the bank. (Sorry I-pad, I remain a Google gal)"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I'm posting here because Samsung refused my post telling the truth. In short I purchased this for my daughter only to find out the truth about this product. I was truly impressed the first few days of use as she was able to download and use apps rather easily. However, to make a long story short, as I found out, the 8gb of HD space is far less than they advertise. Most OS on devices will take up between 1 - 2 gb which is normal, however on this device Netflix was part of the design team for the ICS OS and their software alone takes up 4.19 gb of hd space?!?!? Really??? Why not just give the consumer the ability to download the app. After you take into account ICS OS and Samsungs proprietary apps (which I have no issue with), you basically have approx 2gb of hd space. This limits the amount of apps that can be placed on the HD. That's not all, you cannot manage your photos, videos or music between the device and the expandable card slot. You have to connect the tab to your computer and manage the expandable disc space. This defeats the purpose of a tablet. Tablet's were made to free you from accessing a computer. Therefore buyer please be aware of what you are purchasing."}

That said, I am now stuck with this piece of junk as my return option expired while I was out of the country. The problem is that the thing has serious wifi connection issues. If you do you diligence you will find this is a very, very common problem. Often people will say to reset your router as a fix. My reply to that crazy idea is this is a mobile device, and we don't have access to the many routers offering us wifi signals on the go. Not to mention that other devices have no issues connecting at those locations. It is very frustrating to have a strong signal yet have my tab constantly cycling for a connection. Without wifi its nothing more than a reader or gamepad. I strongly advise people to stay away from this product.\nI have tried using various wifi fix apps, rebooting my tab, turning off the wifi and restarting it, still the same connectivity issues. Sometimes it will connect and very often it won't.\nBad quality."}

I was having chemo and didn't want to have to go to the store or library for books. Plus, I was falling asleep while reading, and my books would close or fall, and I'd lose my place. Coupled with the Poetic StandBook case, problem solved.\nNow chemo's over, and I use my Tab more than ever. I can see work email without running up the stairs to my computer, and I've gradually been adding apps. I haven't even explored all of the ways I could be using my Tab, but there's no hurry.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "At first the product seems to be great. Overall I was happy with the tablet after using it for about 3 months then a couple of days ago I was basically forced to update the device, there was no option to opt out of the update and that is the first problem. As customers we should be able to accept or reject the updates. I had zero problems with my tablet and I was happy with it but who cares about the customer right? After delaying the upgrade several times with 3 hour maximum notification time (not even a 24 hour option), I just had to do it, (I know there are drastic ways to avoid this but I took a path most customers take and did what the tablet was requesting every 3 hours and installed the update, BTW. I doesn't even tell you what version it is going to update it to, so they make it even harder on customers to know what they are getting into. After the upgrade/update most of my shortcuts were gone from the windows, the home layout was different, the notification bar was in the top and the behavior was very different from the previous version. You just have to start trying things in order to figure out the new behavior, clicking the notification bar didn't bring up the notifications now you have to pull them. Rotation will not rotate some of the shortcuts now they are in a fixed place, instead of having the shortcut to all the apps/widgets  always on the top/right corner  now it is on a fixed place and rotating won't move it. I used to be able to look at the clock while running all my apps and now with the change I have to get out of some apps to look at the clock. But the WORST part is that in less than 2 hours after the update the tablet froze and I had to do a hard boot (just pressing the power button did nothing) I had to keep the power button pressed for several seconds until it shutdown and then I was able to start it again.  To be honest I never wanted to upgrade a perfectly working tablet. This type of things makes me stay away from these companies. They think they know what we need and for some it may be ok and they just see it as acceptable but for some people like me this is totally unacceptable, now I will have to use some drastic measures to downgrade it from 4.1.1 (I believe JB) to 4.0.4 (ICS) or now that I remember, I can return it to the store where I bought it and look for an option that give me more flexibility.\nUPDATE: After using it for another day with the 4.1.1 update I hate it even more, there is no screenshot button anymore, you have to press vol down and power buttons at the same time to take a screenshot and believe me half of the time it won't work and you need 2 hands to do it instead of one finger. The other thing is that the button to hide the keyboard is gone. Some people report improved performance but for me performance was not an issue and I don't notice any improvement on performance. I read somewhere that the IR Remote doesn't work on 4.1.1 and that was a selling point."}

When item was received it was loose in a box to big for unit it  didn't have any bubble wrap and one side of box was opened.  Thankfully after close inspection of original box it looked okay but was still doubtful about tab inside being damaged. Since this was a gift I didn't want to break factory seal.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Half of the 8Gb is taken up by the tablets firmware and bloatware. So the real internal memory is about 4 Gb. Recent updates made moving apps to the SD card available again. Thank you Samsung. But, that still leaves minimal space to download apps to the internal memory, which some apps still don't allow you to move to the SD card. The features are great, the speed is great,and the definition is great.\n\nSamsung's customer service will not do anything for you if you are unhappy with their product. You cannot leave a negative product review on their website either. They say that it goes against their posting rules, but it doesn't. I have submitted two product reviews tailored to their posting requirements and both were unjustly rejected. DO NOT trust their rating on Samsung.com because it is engineered by Samsung to falsely give a better impression about their products than it should. You cannot even give feedback about their poor customer worth because they say that they \"appreciate your aggravation and are sorry for the inconvenience, but there is nothing they can do to help\" me. Pay the extra money, get an American product that is governed by American consumer laws, a better supported product, and a more secure product."}

I figured it would be an less expensive alternative but still a brand name that I could trust. I've been pleasantly surprised by the system - it works great and I really love it.  We use Android phones so the interface was very familiar to us - it was just like using a bigger version of our phones. I really prefer this system to the iPad for a lot of things.  Because of the smaller form factor it's easily slipped into my purse (not so much with the iPad).  This comes in handy as I like to make my grocery lists on the notes page.  The iPad is a bit cumbersome for this purpose. Overall, I love it, it works great, it's exceeded my expectations and I'm happy with the purchase."}

I was only going to give this 4 stars because I had some major wifi issues when I sat on the couch with it. But it was updated today and that issue is completely fixed now. It has has a very good voice searcher thats fun to search the app store with among other things. There is one big disapointment with this device where you cannot move apps to SD card. But that is a android problem not a samsung problem. I have used the peel app to turn on and off my big 20 year old big box TV and it worked well. Some people have complained about the issue with only having half the memory they clain it has but it has not been a problem for me. It also has Adobe flash player which can be install on the Adobe archives web page. It works well. If you have any question please feel free to post them and I will try to answer them quickly. Sorry if this review is bad it's one of my first.\n\nUpdate:\nI have had this device for several months now. It get over 8 hours of battery with wifi on but screen brightness on really low. I now check out books from the library on it and can even access my Barns and Noble NOOK account.  I had some more trouble with the wifi but found out it was just the default internet app. Got mozzarella Firefox and got everthing worked smoothly. I now take science notes with the notes application it came with then I back them up to Google drive. Its a really cool feature.  If you get the cable to plug in USBs it works with anything that does not have a battery. I still have no regrets but will keep updating my review when I find new things it can do."}

This tablet, for another 60 bucks was light years better.\n\nSolid construction, smoother interface - everything works and the device has reputable support. Upgraded to android 4.1 no problem. Display is beautiful and screen resists smudges from greasy little kid fingers pretty well!\n\nif you're looking to cheap out on a tablet, you'll suffer like I did.  Cough up a couple more bucks for this - well worth it and works really well.\n\nOnly reason I didn't give it 5 stars is becuase it's not always easy to handle.  It's a little slippery and you push the outside buttons accidentally sometimes.  The soft keys make it easier to navigate than other tablets that have outside nav keys but the power and volume rocker are on the rim.\n\nAlso, not crazy about the fact that Samsung uses some propritary power/data plug in like the Ipad/Iphone.  Let's get away from all that and just use a standard power interface already!!

Easier Navigation and switching between apps.\n2- Kindle has a more sensitive and receptive touchscreen, it seems that I have to push the screen several times sometimes for the Samsung to respond.\n3- Samsung have a better App Store(Google) compared to the Amazon.\n4- Samsung can have a SD drive added.\n5- Samsung has back and Front Camera, Kindle just front.\n6- Samsung has less memory(8GB, 4.5 usable), Kindle starts with 16GB.\n7- Kindle processor is 1.2G while the Samsung is only 1GHz.\n8- Samsung seems to get a little sluggish at times specially when opening several apps in a row where never had that issue with the kindle, maybe because the kindle will not allow apps to continue running in background after closing them.\n9- Seems that the battery life is a little better with the Kindle.\n10- Kindle does not come with a charger(Ridiculous!) and alot of complaints of ads while using Kindle.\n11- Amazon customer service is superb, I don't think anyone beats them.\n12- Samsung has GPS, not the kindle.\n13- Kindle has hDMI output, not the Samsung.\n14- Samsung measured usable Ram is around 700MB and not 1GB.\n15- Same Price.\n16- Amazon Video Library and access is great, Parental control is great. Don't think Samsung has a Parental control and still haven't used their video library and to see if u can download bought movies to watch later?!\n17- Samsung options and settings are more versatile and editable for the experienced than the Kindle.\n18- Battery life is worse for the Samsung compared to kindle, 6 hours on continuous use.\n19- Samsung Tab Glass is NOT Gorrila Glass, Broke after a drop, Kindle took alot more beating and no scratch.\n\nSo far, Seems the Kindle might have been a better option but not sure, I'll keep the Samsung for now and update this review as things change."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I got this tablet for Christmas and love it.  It's very easy to use, it comes with the power cord to charge it.  The charge lasts for several hours.  The android system is very easy to use. The screen is very crystal clear, the pictures that it takes come out very nice.  The only downside to the camera is that it doesn't have a flash, so the lighting needs to be fairly bright otherwise the pictures turn out a bit dark and grainy.  Watching videos, surfing the internet and using apps are much more convenient than waiting for my desktop or laptop to load.  One of the coolest things I think is that I can use my tablet to control my tv, surround sound and blu-ray player!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "So after reading the reviews I decides to go for this Samsung Tablet as my Christmas girft. I may say it a great tablet for such a low price.\n\nSOUND.\nIt has its own speakers, wich are actually grat, but whe holding horizontal, you them with the hands.\n\nCAMERA- no flash.\nThe rear camera is only 3mp but it takes quite good pictures, though It would have been nicer if it had at least LED flash.\n\nPERFORMANCE.\nThis tab offers a great performance, with its 1ghz processor allows you to run some of the best apps and games, though it lacks of Flash Player support, there are many tricks you can make to have Flash.\n\nSCREEN.\nThe screen resolution is quite good, you can play HD videos, and its colors are brilliant. I LOVE IT.\n\nAPPS.\nIt runs all the Google Play apps plus the Samsung Media Hub wich allows you to watch your favorite series for free.\n\nBATTERY PERFORMANCE.\nThe battery performance is up to 4 and a half hours, though it charges very fast (half an hour i got 75% charged.\n\nCONS. It won't charge when plugged in to a computer.\n\nIn the box: Tablet, USB Cable, and the USB AC Adapter for Charging.\n\nI will recomend to buy this tablet with a Crazy On Leather Case Bundle (Great Quality for such low price), and you should get an 32GB microSD.\n\nYou won't regret buying it!"}

The stuff was expedited and arrived before promised, as requested to seller.\nThe tablet looked like \"brand new\" conditions, with packaging indicating it was \"Manufacturer Refurbished in USA\".\nThe equipment performance is excellent as expected so far.\nThis is a serious business doer, therefore I recommend.\n\nAbout the product itself, When you buy this tablet (or the 10-inch one), you will soon want to forget about your old laptop.\nThe Operating System (ice cream sandwich) is very stable, the processor is fast and the overall performance is Excellent."}

If you want a very handy device without mortgaging your house I recommend that you try this one.\n\nExtra! Extra! :  I'm editing this review to say that I found that you can get Adobe Flash by going to the bottom of the product's page here on Amazon to the customer questions section.  WJ had the answer that worked for me. Here it is copied and pasted.\n\n\"Go to the Adobe Flash Archives:\n\nBefore going to the link below make sure you go to setting, security and select or check the \"unknown sources\" box.\n[...]\n\nScroll down and find \"Flash Player for Android 4.0 archives\"\n\nDownload\n\nHope this is helpful :)\nWJ answered on January 1, 2013\""}

I purchased it mostly because it resembled my galaxy smartphone and figured it would be easy to set up for him and use.  So far, it has been great.  I have had no complaints from him about it so far....he spends most of his afternoon and weekends using it for movies, games and google searching.  Now that he is back in school, I am sure it will help him with homework as well.  I couldn't be happier."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "To be fair,  this is my first tablet purchase so my review is not relative to any other tablet options.  However,  I do consider myself a tech junkie and did a good bit of research before my purchase.\n\nMy motivation for buying a tablet was to make my job easier.  I'm an outside sales representative and meet with many clients in their homes or businesses.  I needed a tablet that had a rear facing camera,  expandable storage, and blue tooth capabilities.\n\nI thought I had found the perfect tablet,  and had until I tried to print.  When I'm meeting with clients,  I need to print contracts,  product literature, financial information, etc.  Normally,  I do this from my laptop to my blue tooth portable printer.\n\nHowever,  carrying a laptop can be cumbersome and time consuming to set up.  The Galaxy Tab 2 was the perfect solution,  except that you can only print to a Samsung printer!  Yes, there are apps that allows you to print to other printers,  but only via wifi.  Blue tooth printing, however, is limited to Samsung only.\n\nI realize my application is very specific, and not likely to be an issue to many others.  So,  to be fair, it seems to accomplish other tasks admirably.  My daughter plays games on it.  I've watched a few YouTube videos and music sounds great through the speakers.\n\nSo, all in all, a good tablet but the printing limitations are a deal-breaker for me.\n\n***  Edited Review - a follow-up comment to my review suggested an app that may work for Bluetooth printing.  IT WORKED!!  I'm beyond relieved that this tablet will do the job.  I'm changing my review to 5 stars.  At this price point, and with the ability to run my business through this tablet, there's nothing more I could ask for."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "In general, I'm quite happy with it.  Never wanted an iPad and my budget wouldn't allow for anything new.  Didn't want a used one.  I wasn't sure about a refurbished tablet.  And I really wanted a 10\" screen.  But, I'm pleasantly surprised.  I have a netbook with a 10\" screen.  My computer geek son assured me a refurbished item was a good one.  I also researched tablets with Consumer Reports and this tablet was one of the top 3 for a 7\".\nPros:  It's extremely light.  The color is great.  Worked right out of the box.  Doesn't freeze.  Easy to view e-reader.  I use Nook, BTW, not the Kindle format.  Connects anywhere I want as long as there is wi-fi.  As far as screen size, the 7\" is fine.\nCons:  It didn't come with 8GB of storage.  Not sure if that is because it's a refurb or not.  I really needed to download and print out the manual from Samsung.  It's not as intuitive as my Samsung phone (and after a year, I did get the manual for that as well so I could tweak my use of the phone).  Having the manual helped with things like changing the home pages, widgets, apps, etc.  Ten inch screen would have been better, particularly when using the keyboard. Go for it, folks.  You will be happy."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "The unit has so far has impressed me.  I am not a standard (regular tablet user.)  It was purchased for my daughter in Mid November for a Xmas present. So I had it a while. My wife has an iPad so this is where I get my reference from.\n\nFrom out of the box the unit had a nice solid well built feel to it.  I did not play with it much at first because I didn't want to drop it while it was not protected.  Once in the protective cover, I had a chance to use most of the neat features of the unit.  I have not tested the video quality yet.\n\nPros:\nIn comparison with the iPad, I find it quite useful if not more so.  For one thing I was able to get it to print to my Epson R2000 since it was on my network. This is likely something the iPad can do but I have not really looked that hard either.  The network connection seems to hold very well. I was even able to do limited network intensive operation while tethering to my BB on bluetooth.  The mapping program works great, even on BT.  The camera takes really good pics, much better than the iPad ver. 2.  The movement around the screen was just as fluid as the iPad's.  As far as loading apps, that was relatively painless with Google play, I can even send apps to the unit while logged into my google account.  That is a huge plus, since I am not the primary user of it.  The battery life seems to be on par with what to expect from devices such as these.  With about 8 hours daily use it would be good to plug it in for the night for an overnight charge.  One of the biggest pros to me is the remote app that you can use to program all your devices in your home (bye bye Harmony!)\n\nCons:\nThe only thing I can think of is the fact that the antenna is not that strong.  I was in a hotel and easily picked up the wireless with my laptop. With this unit it seemed a bit more difficult.  This seems to be a problem with many tablet devices. But while in my home it does just fine.\n\nConclusion:\nPound for pound this unit will hold it own with the iPad ver 2. But with the cost in the equation, this wins out big. Especially with the remote app.  Now I just have to figure out away to get it from my daughter. ;)\n\nAlso, nothing gets 5 stars from me..."}

It's called a freaking GALAXY!!!!\n\nPros\n1) Android, Open Source, Freedom.\n2) Fits PERFECTLY in one hand.\n3) FULL ASCII screenlock password (numbers, letters, symbols)\n4) Full encryption for the entire device (configurable).\n5) The GPS works indoors (kinda spooky though, The NSA would have no trouble finding me).\n6) Came with a 32 GB Card (The \"I\" crowd usually goes silent at this point).\n7) Came with a neat Poetic Leather case that is as tough as an old chainsmoking grandmother.\n\nCons\n1) The video playback, while barely noticible, is not as good as the I-Pad (crap I used a bad word).

I like the Acer Iconia A110 the most because it has the most \"utility\". It's sort of the jack of all trades of these devices. It may not do anything the best but it can do the most. I hope that makes sense. I hope my review will help you choose your tablet.  Here's the comparisons\n\nAcer Iconia A110 - $199\nPros - GPS, HDMI Out, Micro SD card slot, Google Play\nCons - Screen Resolution 1024 x 600, Speed is just a tad bit slower than the others,the device is physically thicker and more bulky than the others.\nNotes: This would be a 5 star product if it had a better screen. Only 8GB internal storage without adding a micro SD card. I am able to stream amazon flash based videos by downloading a different browser than the stock chrome. This device runs Android OS 4.1 (Jelly Bean)\n\nKindle Fire HD - $199\nPros - Performance Speed, HDMI Out, Amazon Instant Video, Screen Resolution 1280 x 800\nCons - No GPS, No Micro SD Card Slot, No Android Market/Google Play (Amazon Market only by default), Have to purchase wall charger separately, Layout isn't the standard Android OS GUI. Amazon has created their own UI.\nNotes: Excellent product but the lack of GPS and micro sd card slot is disappointing. The amazon based apps (kindle books & video etc..) have a wonderful UI in comparison to the other 3 devices. 16GB internal storage for the same price as the others is better value. This device is very \"sleek\" This device runs Android OS 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) under the Amazon Kindle GUI.\n\nGoogle Nexus 7 - $199\nPros - Performance Speed, GPS, Screen Resolution 1280 x 800, Google Play\nCons - No Micro SD card Slot No HDMI Out\nNotes: Great product would easily be the best unit if they added HDMI out and a micro sd card slot. This device has 16GBs of storage like the Kindle Fire HD. This devices runs Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) by default.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 - $199\nPros - Performance Speed, GPS, Micro SD Card Slot, Google Play\nCons - Screen Resolution 1024 x 600, No HDMI Out (they make a hdmi out adapter for the other galaxy tab/note models but not for the 7\").\nNotes: Only 8GBs of internal storage like the Acer Iconia A110. This device runs Android OS 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) by default.  For me not having HDMI out is the killer."}

I was worried about the wear and tear a child would put on it but so far so good, it lives up to all the hype of a great tablet. I've found the iPad is too large and the iPad mini too expensive. The size and weight of the Samsung is perfect for their use, and fits easily into my purse. it is easy to use and there are many, many apps that can be installed. Now I wish Santa had brought one to me too! My only issue is that there aren't many choices for cases, I was looking for something unique and colorful."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Replacing the Original Tab.  This was the best move I made.\n\nThe form and size is less bulky and more ergonomic than the Tab.  It is easy to hold the weight is good for long periods of reading unlike any 10\" tablet I have owned or used.  Transporting in a suit or back pocket is a plus.\n\nSpeed and UI is snappy for a single core processor.  Which is a disappointment since the predecessor had a dual core but, to keep the cost low it is a sacrifice I can easily live with.\n\nBattery Life is the best of any computing device I have ever owned I don't have to worry about charging it all the time nor worry about not having enough battery for daily use.\n\nStorage Capacity and SD Slot.  While is was also disappointing in having only 8GB's of storage when the predecessors offering 16 & 32 GB's,  The ability to add up to 64 GB's cards and easy integration of cards make this not really noticeable at all.  No matter what case you may put this in accessing the SD slot is arduous task to say the least.\n\nScreen. Is bright but not as vivid as other tablets but for the price it is pretty darn good.  The screen is great for watching media but not the best for reading periodicals.  If you are in to reading books, manuals, & periodicals I would recommend a 4:3 ratio screen or a 10\" tablet or I hate to say an iXxx device.  Not wanting to have a iXxx device or a hand heavy 10\" tablet is a sacrifice I am willing to make.\n\nThe Tab 2 is a great value and should be relevant in years to come.  I don't see it becoming so out dated any time soon."}

I'm not a reviewer that's gonna bash android, but it still needs some refinement and more responsiveness to the touch, the camera is great for panorama mode on jelly bean 4.1.1, but the 720p video is super grainy i don't recomend video capture neither night or day it's simply awful even for a 3.2 MP camera. To summerise if you want this tablet for the camera then don't do it, get the nexus 7 and get a better powerhouse for your money. Other bad thing about it is the battery life, it takes like 7 hours to fully charge from 1% and it gives you around the day 5 to 6 hours when you use it on power saving mode and  auto screen brightness for music and videos which is quite nice.\n\nNow the good about this tablet\n\n*It does not weight as much as an ipad which for me is great, i hate tablets that break you knuckles.\n*Memory expansion, you can put up to 32 GB Msd for more videos or music (you can't install apps on the MICROSD, you only get 4GB of space to download apps on the device which is horrible but you get what you pay for)\n* It's perfect for one hand use if you want to read books and magazines, 7 inches is the perfect tablet, not so big as an ipad mini or ipad and no so small as a laughfable ipod touch.\n*It does come with  bloatware from samsung that cannot be erased but for the first time is bloatware that you can actually enjoy because samsung has refined their apps to really work with the new tab.\n* it costed 179.00 which is a steal, i was not gonna hand  270 buck's for a a nexus 7 on the net or even 330 for an ipad mini without retina display, apple can stay with their mini ipad, it's not worth it and it's still to big.\n*The google play store has everything i needed for free when the apple store had me pay for the same apps. If you get apple it's obvious you really want to loose cash on stuff that's free on android no brainer.\n*The sound it's incredibly loud on the speakers, better clearer then the ipad's.\n*The resolution 1024x600 is great, i really don't understand how people can see 720p or 1080p on a 7 inch tablet, videos looks incredible on this screen, i really don't understand the nonsense of people wanting HD on a phone or tablet, i do not see a difference between my ipad 4, my samsung S3 and this little guy, for the money you are getting a premium device for a small price tag, way to go samsung you are really killing apple sales and making them consider to lower their so called premium prices for \"premium devices\".\n*Last and not least, it's beautiful, it's well made (really strong) and can be a tablet i can use and take anywhere, this is the real portable tablet, anything else that is not 7 inches is simply clunky and old as a laptop.\n\nWhy i did not buy a kindle Fire? well if you travel abroad the kindle fire will not work outside the US, search google for the troubles\n\nWhy did i not buy a nexus? because it did not have memory expansion, i have tons of tv shows and movies and music, i cannot live without my entertainment, i don't play many games so if you really are a gamer please get the nexus, but if you are a heavy  music player or video loko then get this baby, it's a monster for the price."}

Many places have wireless access now so who needs magazines in the waiting room?  It's pretty zippy too.. quick to come on & the battery lasts pretty much all day.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I purchased this tablet back in April of 2012 with my cellular carrier on a data plan. My original reasoning was as an alternative to the more expensive tablet options out there. I made a mistake. I should have paid more for a better tablet experience. The battery life for this device is miserable. I often find myself having to charge it twice a day with really heavy use. But the worst reason for the device is the total lack of knowledgeable tech support from Samsung. I had an issue with the device trying to do a system update and failing multiple times. After a calling my cellular tech support, who then transferred me to Samsung, they were unable to provide any help with the issue. An hour later, Samsung threw up their hands and blamed it on my cellular carrier. Needless to say, the \"system update\" comes from Samsung, and that is what was not working. Bottom line? Don't purchase this device as a cheaper alternative. You won't be happy."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I own an original Galaxy Tab 7\" wifi and the new Galaxy Tab 2 7\" wifi, and honestly, I have to say the old one is better in almost every respect.\n\nPros:\n*The GTab 2 is lighter, faster, thinner, and has slightly louder speakers.\n*Runs Android 4.0 and the screen is very pretty.\n*Has all the features you'd expect... with one glaring exception (See below).\n*Since it has a newer version of Android, it works with Bluetooth keyboards and HID devices.\n\nCons:\n*The camera is horrible compared to the old one. It doesn't auto-focus, has no flash, has worse resolution, and you can't use it to scan barcodes (which I did a lot with my old GTab). I loved using the flash LED as a flashlight, too... works so much better than using the whole screen. I wish they would have left the camera alone, I would have paid the money for it.\n*The WiFi antenna is situated so that if you hold it upright with your left hand, WiFi reception is almost nothing. Hold it with the other hand (on the other side), it works perfectly. Why is it like this? The old GTab never did this.\n*When connected to a non-Windows computer, it won't let you connect as USB storage. Very frustrating, I can't just plug it in and copy files to it like my old one.\n*The auto-dim screen feature seems to always make it darker than it needs to be. I'm always finding myself turning auto-dim off because I just can't read the screen. Old one wasn't like this.\n\nMy opinion:\nIf I had known the camera was so bad on this, I wouldn't have bought it, even at the low price I got it for. I used the camera  for close-up photos, some low-light shots, and scanning barcodes... none of which the GTab 2 can do. In every other respect it works great- good performance, etc- but I'm really second-guessing my decision to buy it based on the camera. I was hoping it would be a great replacement for my old GTab workhorse, but it falls short. I will probably give it to my daughter and reclaim my old GTab."}

The kids were so excited, and have been playing with them non stop!  My kids are 9 and 5 and I was a little concerned about them having access to the andriod app market and internet without any controls, but after a google search I found app lock, a free app that allows you to lock any app with a password!  Now when they want to go on youtube, or download a game they have to come to me first!  Sorry to compare to the Kindle Fire, but their app market just doesn't hold up to googles!

So I don't own anything that deals with technology newer than 2008. I've used other people's tablets, and smartphones so I knew the jist of how they work. When I got this tablet for Christmas it was super easty to use and navigate. Within the first day I was running it like a pro. Its fast and very touch sensative. The battery is good. It usually lasts me anywhere from 6-8 hours depending on what i'm doing. The screen is clear and movies work well on it. The ONLY down fall so far is the camera. It doesn't take very clear pictures, but I knew that when I was buying it. I didn't buy it for the camera. My wife is jealous and wants one too know."}

I really struggled with whether I should get the larger size or this 7\" before he bought it but I am SO happy with the smaller 7\" screen.  It fits in my hands perfectly and isn't awkward to hold comfortably.  I haven't even begun to find all the cool stuff I can do with this but everything that I've seen so far has been amazing!  I think Mac and Ipads are overrated for the price!  This tablet seems to do all the same and maybe more for much less $$$!  Super happy with my tablet, I can take it everywhere with me!  Everyone should get one!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I waited for the iPad Mini to come out, but when it did, I was disappointed in the price and the features.  Insisting on 7 inch tablet that is a comfortable size for a reader, I considered all of the 7 inch models that were available at the time.  Each one seemed to have different features that made it a better alternative than the others.  What made me choose this one was the balance between the price and the features.  While I know it doesn't matter for everyone, the expandable storage was a major selling point for me, even if the specs were a little less than the competition.\n\nSo far, I have been completely happy.  The display is crisp and clear, and the sound is great.  This is a lightweight tablet that is easy to hold.  I would say the one downside is the backside is smooth and doesn't provide much grip, so the right type of case may be necessary for some.  I do not play resource-hogging games, so I can't speak for the performance of those apps, but as for the email app, web browser, and Kindle app (the 3 apps I use the most), the performance is excellent.  I would consider this more of a productivity tablet and less of a gaming tablet, but if that's the type of tablet you need, this is the perfect balance of price, features, and performance."}

One is that it lacks the \"flash\" on the camera, though the camera itself is amazing. Secondly, the storage on the device is very good. Most apps run, yet some such as \"WHATSAPP\" do not run. Internet is very fast, Chrome, obviously is the best browser to use. Additionally, the tab, even though it is 7 - inch, really fits my standards.

I was so excited that I went ahead and ordered him the keyboard case and screen protector as well. Well everything came in and I unwrapped it all to start putting it together and while in the process of setting the tab 2 up, it just flipped out on me. I was trying to tap the English button to set up languages and such and it was like there was an invisible finger pressing something else in the corner of the screen. I powered it down, wiped the screen, Googled the issue and everything and nothing worked to fix the problem so I never got past the set up screens. The screen never would recognize my selections. I emailed Amazon about getting a replacement and starting the return process only to be told, \"so sorry\" but they were out. And they have been out now every day since I bought it. The only option they say is to return it and get a refund. WTH? I purchased the case and everything for this specific unit and now I don't have one and to buy another one would cost me almost $100 more than I paid so what now I'm just out? This experience has sucked and I won't be buying any electronics off of here again. I will stick to waiting in line at a store where I know I can go and exchange the item when it doesn't work instead of being screwed over with a case and protector that doesn't have anything to fit now!

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "At first I like this little tablet. I do like the size and the processor seems to be quick enough. The original Android build and Samsung software was nice. Half the available storage is taken up and hidden by the Samsung software, but i put in an SD card and since I only bought this to do Android development with the storage was fine. The size is really nice and has made me think that I'd really like the Note II. It's smaller than my iPad and is easy the take off to meetings (unfortunately the poor WiFi renders it useless). The screen looks nice - though not nearly as good as my iPad.\n\nHowever, the WiFi radio on this device is so weak as to be unacceptable. I wrote a Java RTSP library to stream video from IP cameras. When I took this tablet into the office I found that the range limitation was so short I simply could not demonstrate the application unless standing virtually right next to the WiFi router. All other devices had no issues with coverage - iPhones, laptops, iPads, etc.\n\nThe camera is also of such poor quality that some barcode scanning prototyping I was working on never has worked. In fact while Scanlife can generally scan EZScan codes, other scan software simply won't focus sufficiently to read the \"UPC\" codes on products. Even \"normal\" pictures never seem to be in sharp focus.\n\nFinally, the touchscreen does not seem to be responsive. I'v found that I have to be very careful with my aim when pressing the menu buttons at the bottom of the screen and it often takes 3 or 4 tries to actually click the button.\n\nOverall I'm disappointed with this device. From what I have read this WiFi only version is very cheapened down - people that have the version with 3g say their WiFi works just fine."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "From my research on tablets I decided to try this product as my introduction to the tablet world. I have extensive experience with computers but this was a new world to me. It somehow seemed silly to me to name an operating system \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" or \"Jelly Bean\".\n\nI didn't want to spend a lot of money on something which I originally viewed as a fad but my children and grandchildren can't seem to get along without these devices.  By the way - I don't have a smartphone - only a dumb phone for use in emergency.  I am learning about apps and operation of the device. So far no problems and I am beginning to rely on it for information. I use it with my home wi-fi set up and I find that there are more and more locations that allow public connection. I even used the device to play a game while waiting to see a doctor. - The waiting time went by faster.\n\nPerhaps there are better devices but for the \"toe in the water\" experience this device works well and there are many applications for it - you just have to learn where to look and how to use them. If grade school kids can learn then \"why oh why  can't I\".\n\nI would like to tell more of my experiences but so far they are minimal - but so far - all good!\n\nMaybe I will tell you more in the future - that is if I can tear myself away from being chained to this device.\n\nBy the way - the price was right and better than what was asked for a competing device named after a piece of fruit that tempted a women a long time ago! For an older guy this was important!!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Like the Nexus 7, this seems to have me a bit undecided on whether this or the Nexus 7 makes the best 7 inch tablet for Android. This falls behind the Nexus in specs, but makes up for it in other features like TouchWiz, the IR remote, and expandable memory. The one major drawback for me is that this particular model is limted to the 8gb memory capacity (with the exception of the student addition which I can't find anywhere anymore, but even that's limited at 16 gb). Something like this, I feel, should be at a minimum of 16 gb with an option for 32 gb. If it was a 32gb one, I'd choose this one in a heartbeat over the Nexus 7, but because it's lacking that memory, it's a toss up between this and the Nexus 7.\n\nTo give a little bit more background information:\n\nI started off with a Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet and loved it so much that I wanted another Samsung tablet that was smaller in size for portability. I figured that besides specs, the only way the Tab 2 would fall behind its big brother the Note 10.1 would be that it lacks the S-Pen. So I bought it (sadly, I paid like $200 or $250 and a month or so later, I saw the price for this model drop to about $149). When I got the device, I saw that it performed much slower than the Note 10.1, which was expected. However, it was still a sweet device with the ability to use front and rear cameras, edit documents, enjoy the Android app store (Google Play), and so forth.\n\nBut with my usage (pictures, movies, video games, apps), it filled up too fast. Of the 8gb, I think you only get to use 5 or 4 and a half, so you're pretty much restricted to space. If you're using it just for things like email, streaming video (YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, etc.), and for surfing the web with the occasional app or game download, then this should be perfect. But if you're going to use it for all those functions in addition to things like downloading games (esp. the high memory games), apps, and so forth, then you might want to look elsewhere for a device with more memory.\n\nWhile you can use the micro SD card with this device, it does not allow you to transfer apps to it as older Android phones and tablets would let you. But you can still transfer documents, PDF files, songs and stored videos to the card to lighten the load on the device. That helps out tremendously, especially if you have enough songs to take up a gig of storage, videos to take up the same amount of space, and a bunch of documents like textbooks for school. But you still have to limit your app selection to just a couple of games (if they're big ones), and apps.\n\nUltimately, I found it a very useful device, but the storage limitations had me look elsewhere for a 7 inch device (I settled on the Nexus 7, 32 gb and with better specs but lacking Samsung's lovely TouchWiz that makes using the device such a pleasant experience). As for the Tab 2, I didn't return it. I felt it was still a great device. So now I downloaded an app designed for parents to customize the user experience on it that way my son can play his games and watch his videos and read his books on it when we're traveling or at the doctor's office, etc. It still sees a lot of use, just not by me.\n\nI would definitely recommend this tablet, but would also advise people to be cautious of memory usage. Many people don't need that much memory and can be fine with a couple of games or a few heavy apps and use it without any problems. It definitely beats most of the competition with the exception of its main rival, the Nexus 7. It wins out over the Kindle Fire HD easily (which I also own), and the Nook Tablet (which I sold due to the lack of apps available for it). Keep in mind, this review is coming from someone who likes to download apps for all sorts of things (games, checkbook, word processors, photo editing, etc.) so this is why it gets a more negative review than others might give it. For the price, however, I'd easily say this is one of the best choices out there and still recommend it for those looking for a great tablet at an affordable price (almost unbeatable price depending on where/when you buy it)."}

I called Samsung about it and they had my ship it back to them. Got it back two weeks later working again. After playing with it for a couple of days the battery finally needed to be charged. So pluged it in for about fours. When I went to check on it the battery meter showed that it was lower then when I pluged it in. I called Samsung again about it and they had my ship it back to them. Got it back two to three weeks later working again with a full charge on it. Played with it again to drain the battery to see if it would charge. Well it wouldn't. By now I have been without a fixed tablet for three months. I've shipped it to them twice already. Called Samsung want a complete exchange. They said sure no problem. Told me it was approved and that the nearest UPS store will contact me when the new tablet has arrived for me to do an even exchange. They said it could take up to 5 days. On the 5th day, Samsung called me and told me that they made a mistake and can not the UPS even exchange. Now they want me to give them my credit card info for there file and to put on hold. Then they will ship a new tablet out to me in 10-14 days. Or they can process the exchange to where I send them my broken \"P.O.S\" tablet to them and wait another 14-21 days to get a new one. All of that is after they approve my exchange request and email my a return shipping label. Well I'm still waiting on the email. Its going to be aleast 5 months before I have a working tablet."}

While I'm still learning to use it, I can say already that I'm very happy with this purchase.\nI am a Spanish teacher and I have a long commute. I wanted a light tablet which allowed me to read books, as well as work on my lessons during my commute. I also wanted a tablet that could fit in my purse. After using my sister's Kindle for a couple of days, I was sure that I didn't like it. I needed a more user-friendly tablet that allowed me to do things easily.\nAfter reading many reviews, I decided to buy this one. I'm so happy! I have been using it for only a few days. Reading is comfortable (I prefer to hold it horizontally) and my eyes are also happy. I uploaded some material for my classes and used it already with one student. He enjoyed it very much and I know this will be an excellent teaching tool.\nI am still discovering new apps but so far I love the possibility of reading newspaper articles even without being connected to the Internet. I can check my e-mails, take notes, visit my favorite sites and even take pictures (and videos) without any problem. Videos look great.\nTyping is smooth but I still have to find a way to add Spanish accents marks, which I'm sure is possible.\nSo far, it's the perfect tablet for my needs and I find myself using it also at home, instead of my laptop.\nI also bought a SanDisk microSDHC 32GB Flash Memory Card to expand the memory and Poetic Slimbook Leather Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. They are also perfect. I might get a stylus pen for taking notes.\n\nOne day later: I found out how to add Spanish accents marks. Just hold the letter for a second and the keyboard will show you the options. For ex.: hold the \"e\" and it will give you the possibility of adding an \"\".\n\nTwo months later: I still love this tablet. I've been using it daily and the only problem I had so far was with the SanDisk microSDHC 32GB Flash Memory Card. It crashed twice when turning the tablet on. In these occasions I got an alert that I needed to format the memory card and that all my content would be lost. It was annoying but at least it happened at home and I was able to copy the material I needed from my laptop. But if it had happened during one of my classes, it would definitely had been very frustrating."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "There are two kinds of people in the world... ones that have used smartphones and tablets.. and the ones that haven't. The ones that haven't number enough to fit on the head of a pin. I am one of those people. But FINALLY, I'm making the jump into handheld mobile computing, and this Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is working out splendidly. So, a few remarks for anyone else just now jumping off the head of that pin into the 21st century...\n\n1) This tablet is awesome. Thumbs up. Absolutely recommend. For the price it is a great value. No reason this should not be a good a choice for newcomers. I figured for $200 if I dump it in a year for something else it would still be a good deal. But I'm sticking with this unit until the technology rolls over (probably about a year ;>).\n\n2) It runs the latest version of the Android operating system. The system is not 'locked' as on other hardware sold with Android such as the Kindle. This means maximum compatibility with the apps you wish to install. And believe me, once you have gotten used to the basic functioning of the tablet, it's ALL about the apps.\n\n3) Tablet/mobile computing is a life changing experience. Mobile computing is nearly as revolutionary as the Internet itself. I would dare say that mobile computing is more useful in your personal day-to-day life than traditional desktop computing. Desktop computing started in the 'Dark Ages' (DOS, early graphical user interfaces), and proceeded to the \"Middle Ages' (evolved operating systems, voice recognition, data sharing, etc), but has basically stalled. Portable computing is the evolutionary leap into the 'Renaissance'. Computers are now beginning to behave the way people who know nothing about computers expect computers to behave (more Star Trek like).\n\n4) The 7\" form factor is a great size. Not too big. Not too small. I no longer use my iPod Touch to listen to music (except when exercising). I installed the 'TuneSync' app which copied all my iTunes music and playlists to the tablet. And because the tablet is right-sized I tend to take it everywhere. A good portion of the work that used to accomplish on my laptop is performed on the tablet.\n\n5) Accessories purchased: Leather case. Also acts as a backstop to prop the tablet up on a flat surface for hands feww viewing (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Poetic-Slimbook-Leather-Case-for-Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-2-7-0-Black/dp/B007YUISN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Poetic Slimbook Leather Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 Black</a>. A memory card to expand storage&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SanDisk-32-GB-Mobile-microSDHC-Flash-Memory-Card-SDSDQ-032G-AFFP/dp/B007KFXIDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFP</a>. Both of these have been invaluable. Next purchase will likely be a Bluetooth keyboard.\n\n6) There IS a learning curve. This is a different world from desktop computing. Different interface. Different terms and acronyms. Different mind-set. Although you can somewhat intuitively learn the touch based interface and run apps and even download and install new apps, the process of syncing your desktop data with the tablet (music, images, videos, documents) is a WORK IN PROGRESS. The free Samsung application for its tablets that supposedly helps with this is a bit of a joke (Kies). You are sort of left to develop the wheel on your own, so try and hook up with a kid or someone who has figured out how to set up sync media for your tablet, specifically to the external add-on memory card (where there's more room to put everything). That will save you some headaches.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nUPDATE February 22, 2013: Best way to Root\n\nOnce you get your tablet all set up --which can take many many hours of copying songs, photos, videos, etc., plus downloading and configuring apps, plus futzing with various settings, plus arranging all your icons, plus operating system updates-- you want a way to back up EVERYTHING in case you lose your tablet, or whatever. Unfortunately it seems the native Android operating system running on this tablet does not provide a way to back up EVERYTHING. I tried several apps from the app store, the native Google cloud backup, and the Samsung Kies backup... and none of them backed up EVERYTHING. Each of these apps back up a FEW things. For example, none of them backed up my email account settings. I learned that the only way to get a true, full backup is to \"root\" your tablet. Rooting simply means gaining full control over the Android OS. Rooting can void your warranty, but not having to spend another couple of days redoing everything (assuming I could even remember everything I did) made it worth rooting my tablet. If you choose to the root route here is the best link I found for doing so after quite a bit of research: Wait... ok, the Amazonian Police have removed the links. Just go to the galaxy-tab2 website (add the c-o-m). That's the ticket.\n\nOnce you have the tablet rooted you want to do that EVERYTHING backup I keep mentioning. Install a free app called \"ROM Manger\" from ClockworkMOD, which will back up ALL of the main memory card of the tablet (but not the removable external card). For the procedure google 'nandroid backup galaxy tab 2' and look for the link entitled 'How to Perform a Nandroid Backup and Restore it to your Android'.\n\nAnother useful [free] backup app good for doing SELECTIVE backups and restores (it's wisest to use both) is 'Titanium Backup'.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nUPDATE February 28, 2013: A few good apps\nMost of the Samsung supplied apps can be replaced with [usually free] more robust counterparts from the google play store. I did the following:\n\nThe built-in Gallery app for displaying photos and video doesn't allow much flexibility over the sort order of your photos, so I replaced it with Photo Gallery from Fish Bowl Software.\n\nThe native Google Play Music app is pretty good, but Rocket Music Player from JRT Studio has a few extras like a sleep timer, an indicator of how many songs are in a playlist, and the ability to specify the media folder. I also installed MixZing because it is one of the few players that can display song lyrics imbedded in the music file (as with iTunes).\n\nI use iTunes, and a good app for syncing your library to the tablet is TuneSync from Fireleap software ($5.99 for unlimited version). It copies over songs, playlists, and any \"meta data\" in the song files such as album art and lyrics.\n\nA good non-cloud alternative to the stumbly Samsung supplied Kies app for syncing other data from a computer is Cheetah Sync. The free version will sync one folder on the PC to the tablet. For $2.99 you get unlimited folder sync. A stay away from The Cloud as much as possible so this is a rare find.\n\nOther nifty apps are Google Sky Map for viewing and identifying stars. 3D Digital Weather Clock displays weather, date, time, moon phase, and battery charge. Nav Free provides turn-by-turn voice prompted navigation without the need for a wifi connection. Handrite Free allows you to take notes by writing on the tablet with a stylus or your finger. The built in Memo app does a good job for typed notes. ListNote let's you speak your memos and converts them to text. Google Translate for speaking sentences you type in a different language.\n\nAnd many many many more..."}

Not too expensive so it's not high end but it's not too cheap to where it's hardware is low quality. It gets slow after running too many apps but theres a widget that brings you to the task manager to close them down. Battery life is good as long as it's brightness is kept on automatic and it's not being turned on every 20-30 seconds while on the road.\n\nApps I commonly use for this:\nChrome, Google+, Gmail, Facebook, tumblr, instagram, google music, and google voice.\n\nAs you can see, I use it for a lot of google based stuff (it's an android thing, y'know?). Social websites run smoothly based on wifi bandwidth. Chrome can open any website/flash animation/gifs no problem, of course with bandwidth kept in mind. Like any other Android device, I recommend a SD card with more than 16GB+ on the side cause this tablet can easiley be a media hub. The screen (7in) is big enough for watching vids in comfort, and the base music app offers some interesting options. Photo app comes with a customizable slideshow option too. Games? vary on what you download. I don't recommend 3D MMO's just cause theres potential for failure and that correlates with the proccessor, not the screen size.\n\nOne thing I need to mention is it's ability to act as a remote (app pre-installed) to control tv's (samsung only). The reciever for it is on the right hand side of the device. I haven't tried it yet but I guess if you just so happen to have a recent model samsung tv then by all means, go for it. regardless of this semi-useless feature, it's still worth the investment. Plus it fits in my cargo pockets.\n\nUPDATE 31JAN13\n\nSo my I upgraded my Galaxy Tab to 4.1 Jellybean. Theres no real complaints about the new UI from me. I've noticed that now I can multi task while watching a video, though this feature might have always been there. Theres nothing too major to point out and with that in mind I have to say that as long as the tablet isn't overloaded with crap, it'll always run fine. Android devices are only limited by the hardware's potential and this tablet has a lot."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I just bought this tablet yesterday at a local Walmart (because BestBuy was sold out) and I must say, it's awesome! I haven't been a fan of the Android OS because I've always thought it was too complicated, but I changed my mind. I own an iPad 2 and I didn't want to buy the iPad Mini because I was basically going to get the same thing in a smaller size, so I ventured towards Android and found the 7\" Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 which is a little smaller than the iPad Mini. I'm a HUGE Apple fan (I own Apple TV, Macbook Pro, iPad 2, iPhone 4, iPod Nano and iPod Touch), but recently I feel that they are making their customers spend money over and over again on the same things with just a few updates and I feel that isn't fair. Again, this little tablet is wonder for a first tablet, fans of Android, and Apple fans who choose not to buy an iPad Mini because they own an iPad. At first it took me a few hours to get use to the Android OS, but the more I use it, I'll get better. Great tablet."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I bought this for my wife to use as HER dedicated media consumption device.  I did considerable research on the newer, state-of-the-art 7 inch tablets.  Here is some of my thinking:\n-  We have an iPad that was originally hers and which she uses to read her magazines, but which is too big to be conveniently carried on trips (and which is often being used by the kids). The new 7\" Ipad is a lot more expensive, and Apple's closed system tyranny and draconian forced-obsolescence-by-sneaky-forced-upgrades-that-screw-things-up pisses me off, so I focused on Android tablets.\n-  We also have a Kindle Fire that she also reads her magazines on, but that is also used by the kids for reading their school books.  Since the Kindle Fire is also based on an Android OS and there is no problem accessing her magazines on it, I never considered that there might be a problem getting the magazines on a new tablet.\nI chose the Samsung 7\" Galaxy Tab2 because, of all the 7\" Android tablets, only this Samsung device provided for memory expansion.\nI am saddened because the 7\" Tab-2 is a beautiful device, and it seems to work well for a lot of purposes, but to my horror, it is not possible to load any of my wife's favorite magazines (including Allure, InStyle, and a number of cooking magazines.)  Some of these magazines are in fact available for purchase from the Samsung's magazine aggregator of choice, but they would require that my wife repurchase all of the subscriptions she already owns (they don't have a way to port over existing subscriptions, apparently).  Repurchasing all of these subscriptions would more than double the price of the tablet itself.\nPerhaps it is not entirely the fault of this tablet, so I will concede that the one-star rating may be somewhat harsh.  But I am pissed off that Samsung, Google, Amazon, Zinio, and the like, seem to be more interested in building their own fiefdoms and locking consumers into their own proprietary markets.\n\nThis is not the \"open\" environment I was led to expect.  Companies please take note:  Holding your customers hostage is not a good long-term strategy!"}

Lithium battery life last for hours, charges fast. I purchased the cheap Bluetooth leather/rubber keypad and it works great. I can read all my Emails, News, Weather, Research, and a lot more. The settings for the main controls are easy to access because of the info screen on the bottom right when you tap there it pops up. There is also a short cut screen if you touch the front center it pops up on the bottom of screen. Touch screen works very good, has many options that are customizable, and is nicely done. Many apps that are preinstalled I don't need, I have to find a way to get ride of them permanently, for now you can only delete the updates and the factory copy is reinstalled. Samsung has a full blown keyboard docking station that you can purchase for $79.\n\nThere is a lot of junk you can install from the WEB, be careful, install AVG FREE Antivirus. Watch what apps you download so they don't rob your CPU power. A lot of the apps track you, in some you can turn options off in the program settings to save power or manually turn off WiFi and GPS and turn them on as needed.\n\n*** Important ***\n\n1) There is 8gb of internal storage (depending on the model you have), but they install the operating system on it which takes up almost half of it leaving you with 4.59gb left. You can put a lot of stuff in there even with only the standard memory! You can also install up to 32gb of external flash memory but be careful and take your time, it is tricky to put that little thin sucker into the side slot without dropping it and until it clicks. Kind of a balancing act on one finger then push it in with your thumb nail.\n\n2) There is no paperback user manual, you need to download .PDF file from their website. The paper manual costs over $20.00!! Call Samsung and gripe, maybe we all can get them to send us all one for free!\n\nAll in all a very nice unit, buy one now if you can wait while they are on back order.\n\n\"This is not a toy\" for children. READ THE HUGE SAFETY BOOKLET THAT COMES WITH UNIT or manual pages 206 and 207.\n\n*** Update ***\n\nIt is amazing all the features this has, the apps are endless. I just did my online banking and deposited my check from home, I used the banks app and tried the mobile deposit and it worked!!You can search your TV listings, weather, read the Bible, find POI with the GPS, Skype video calls, make free land line calls with GrooveIP or Gmail. I can read all my local online newspapers for free. I found a police scanner and a Electrical Circuit app too.\n\nThe world is at your finger tips and it is very addicting to say the least!! Dang, it even controls my TV and it is not a smart TV!! As long as it doesn't control me I will be OK, 8~)"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "So Samsung started bundling this with a keyboard, but if you bought the tablet beforehand, you might be seeking that same keyboard.  Good luck finding it.  Even the Samsung site doesnt have it.  And if you don't pay attention to the fine print or the reviews, you'll end up buying a Samsung Galaxy dock which only fits the previous version.  They found it necessary to change the size of the footprint just slightly to require a completely different keyboard mount than earlier versions.  Ipod it is NOT.  So beware of any peripherals that are not specific to the Galaxy Tab 2 7-inch.  Specifically related to the dock or keyboard.  Otherwise, it works fine with the android system and has expandable storage.  The model intro leaves much room for improvement.  Perhaps thats why the bundle came out...."}

He has been playing with it for a few days now and loves it, discovering new things every day.  It came on right away, charges with both the wall adapter and if plugged into his desktop computer. He took his micro SD card from his old tablet and put it in this, and could access all of his music.  The apps are great, he has many MANY more to explore, just scratching the surface, but very happy so far.  I have a Kindle Fire HD which I purchased within the past couple of months and we've been comparing notes.  One thing that I can do is hook the Kindle Fire up to our TV with HD(whateveryoucallthatcord:-) and we can watch movies...you can't do that with the Samsung.  He has access to all the google play apps, I am not able to use all of them unless I can figure out a work-around, but Amazon provides me with more than I know what to do with.  I don't have a micro sd card slot, but can store on Amazon Cloud.

I was in the market for a tablet and wanted to get a name brand tablet running Android OS and I have been a Samsung user ever since I went from the iOS to Android, ANDROID RULES!\nI picked this one up from Warehouse deals from Amazon for get this $165.00 with free shipping. They described the item as Very Good and let me tell you it was even better! When the package arrived the only thing that didn't look brand new was the original packaging and that was only due to the fact of them repacking the item. When I opened the box the tablet still had what looked to be the original plastic on the screen and chassis.  Tablet is perfect not one imperfection to be seen. I would highly recommend if your looking for a deal look no further than warehouse deals! I felt safe knowing that the order was fulfilled by Amazon and that's important when making an online purchase.\n\nI could go on and on about this Tablet. It is so much fun to use! Well worth the money this thing is!\n\nPros\nIR Blaster - super cool!\nBluetooth - Stream music on your BT enabled stereo!\nAndroid ICS - latest and greatest\nDisplay\nBattery Life - very good\n\nCons\nNone"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I was in the market for a tablet for my son. I was considering the Kindle Fire, but then saw the Samsung Tab 2. This is a much more versatile tablet. Looking at the specs, the two are very competitive. However, on closer inspection, the Tab 2 came out the winner. And here's why:\n\n- The Samsung Tab 2 has upgradable storage. I can add up to a 32 GB micro SD card to the Samsung. The Kindle is not upgradable.\n\n- The Samsung Tab 2 has both a front and rear facing camera. If all you want to do is Skype, then the front-facing camera is fine, but if you want to take pictures using the Kindle, good luck.\n\n- The Samsung uses Android Ice Cream Sandwich, and I prefer it to the Kindle's UI. The Kindle seems to use Android apps, but these must be purchased through Amazon's front end. I guess I prefer the versatility of the Samsung App store and Google Play.\n\n- The Samsung uses a \"standard\" tablet UI environment. This is a minor point, but I like the thought of my son getting used to a more conventional UI, as it will prepare him to use a real tablet in a real world. He's growing up in a world where tablets are commonplace tools. If he learns how to navigate and organize his day using a standard tool, he will be better prepared in tomorrow's world. Again... a small point, but an important one.\n\nCons:\nThe Sammy DOES have a proprietary charger as opposed to USB (This is where the Kindle wins). For this reason, I cannot give the Sammy a full 5 stars.\nThe Sammy also lacks the app time-out feature of the Kindle, which lets parents set time limits on some apps. This is easily accomplished using apps on Google Play, however."}

The first time on the Tablet I was able to access my email without any problems and that was my main concern. I am looking forward to puting my music and pictures on it while using the apps. This tablet is something that I can grow into without  it being out of date in a few months."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "UPDATE: 4/25/2013\n\nI have had the Galaxy Tab for 6 months now and would like to make a few comments.\n\nFirst, the touch interface has gotten very buggy. Often I need to blow up the internet page to over 200% so I can get the precise input. Sound when playing Netflix and audiobooks is grainy. The biggest problem, though, is the one I have with power. I can't seem to figure out how to charge this tablet. I don't want to over-charge it, but if I leave it a few days without use and not plugged in, the tab is completely dead. So dead that it won't power up even when plugged in. This has happened several times. Upon keeping it plugged in 100% of the time and attempting to boot it up, the tab froze on the battery screen and I sent to Samsung for service. The website makes it nearly impossible to process a service request, so I had to phone it in. As it turns out, the tab needed a new motherboard (which seems pretty significant for a brand new item--maybe it was a fluke, who knows). Within a week my repair request was processed and the tab is on its way back, but I am skeptical. If these types of problems reveal themselves in 6 months, what happens when it's out of warranty?\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm going to try to make this concise and hit the major points, so it will help all you tablet-seekers make an informed decision before you finish your x-mas shopping.\n\nAbout me: 30s, non-technie, don't care one way or the other about gadgets. I do have an iPod touch, which I love, but the screen is simply too small for me to do a lot of things I wanted to do with the tablet.\n\nWhat I use the Galaxy Tab for: E-mails while traveling, Netflix, e-books/audio books, apps.\n\nSince I've never had a tablet before, some of these things may be typical of all tablets or unique to the Samsung. In any event, here are my pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n+Vibrant screen, easy to watch movies, read, and use apps\n+Touch is, for the most part very responsive (see my comment below)\n+Easy to navigate the unit despite never using an Android device before\n+Battery life is impressive, even after watching movies or reading for several hours\n+Easy to get accessories for (case/stand/usb keyboard)\n+Optional 32G SD card, which you pop right in and forget about\n+Price: with the exception of all of the additions you will need (case, memory card, extra charger, etc.) it cost the same as my iPod touch with much more functionality/features\n+Weight: perfect for travel, lightweight yet sturdy (I even take it to the gym and use it on the elliptical machine)\n+GPS!\n\nCons:\n-The WiFi signal seems inconsistent. Not that it's bad, but hovers around average, even if I'm near my router\n-Links on the internet are sometimes not responsive to touch. Not sure if that is the browser or the websites themselves\n-Netflix can be laggy, especially when it buffers\n-This is a major one for me...the volume rocker and the power button are nearly on top of each other. I'm not very tactile so almost every time I go to adjust the volume I inadvertently turn the screen off. Really annoying but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it\n-Android apps require a ton of permissions. As in, they basically tell you how they are going to invade your privacy. Maybe iOS apps do this too and they just don't tell you. I also don't like that a lot of apps require full-time access to the internet\n\nIn sum: for the difference in price I would definitely choose this tablet over a knock-off in the $100 range. it is a user-friendly, fully-functional, and handy accessory for travel or anyone \"on the go\". The only thing I would consider upgrading is possibly to a bigger screen, but then you sacrifice weight and portability factors.\n\nHappy holidays!"}

The picture quality is great and easy to share pictures or even show friends and family.  I need to figure out how to upload the videos, because none of our videos uploaded on the tablet. We mainly use this for pictures, internet, netflix, youtube and facebook. We don't plan on uploading tons of apps so the internal memory being 8gb isn't a big deal for us.  Ultimately it's a smaller tablet for reading, so I can't expect it to do it all. Overall we are happy with out samsung galaxy purchase."}

More good than bad.\nHowever it gets 4 stars because:\n\n1 - It comes with 768Mb of RAM and not 1Gig as described by amazon. They never said 1G of ram on the box so I can't fault Samsung. Perhaps I received the wrong model? I don't think so because everything else checks out. As with any computer for heaven's sake don't scrimp on the RAM!\n\n2 - As of 2012-12-05 I have not found a way to install apps to the memory card. Google's fault. Fix it Google."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Now, I know a lot of this is my own damn fault for thinking back to when it was newly advertised and not checking into what people's experiences have been so far; a lot of my problems also result from Amazon themselves, and from third parties.  I just don't want people to make the mistake I did - I'm not whining about it, not asking for my money back, just letting people know what they are NOT going to be able to do with this device.\n\nFirst, the good parts is that it's a nice tablet and, with the price drop, a pretty nice deal.  There are a lot of reviews covering the good points - I find the screen crisp and responsive (although I haven't yet put a protector on it); wifi speed is great - can stream netflix and looks pretty good.  As a device to replace a lot of what I was using my phone for (besides \"phone\" things), this tablet is really quite nice - it's a pleasure web surfing and using email compared to a phone screen, and it's got decent processing speed and plays games quite nicely.  Decent display for reading, although I personally still prefer e-ink for reading.\n\nBut I'm disappointed in what I'm not able to do with it; the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 can do video output - this can't.  I was hoping to hook it up to the TV in my exercise room to watch while working out, but no dice... not even SD.\n\nOn top of that, I recently signed up for Amazon Prime... but you cannot stream video from Amazon to this device - it was part of the reason I signed up for prime.  This is not a flaw of the device, but of Amazon - an artificial barrier, seeing as how you can play streaming content on \"blessed\" android devices.\n\nAs a side note, in trying to bypass using an app for Amazon streaming by accessing it on the web, we find out that Adobe no longer makes a compatible flash player for the latest versions of Android.  If you download a browser, like Dolphin or Firefox, that has built in flash, Amazon still claims the device is not compatible.\n\nAgain - it's not flaws of the device, really, but it limits what you can do with it, and I just wanted to throw it out there that other Galaxy's - the Tab 2 10.1, the old 7.0, the 7.0 plus - all have features and abilities this tablet does not have.  Yes, they cost more, but examine whether it's worth it for you before buying this one.  As I write this, the Galaxy 2 10.1 is actually a really great price given the much larger size - and for some reason it can output video while this one can't (you'd think it'd be essentially the same exact thing except for screen size, but no).\n\nI don't know how this next one compares to other tablets - but on my phone I can move downloaded apps to the SD card.  At 8MB, being one of the lower memory tablets available, I got mine along with a microSD card to save on device space, but it doesn't allow me to move apps to the SD card.\n\nSo it's a decent tablet, but given some of the other great deals available right now you should think of other options.  If you're willing to go even higher, I bought the wife and kids 7.0 pluses last year and they are pretty happy with them (still no Amazon instant video, though); they are far superior, but of course also far more costly.  If you think video output or Amazon instant video might be interesting, I implore you to examine other tablets and do the research on them.\n\nAs a larger device to do what I've been doing with my phone (except calling), it's definitely a decent product.  I was just hoping to do more."}

For me, this is a secondary media device- I run my laptop as a media center hooked to my HDTV and wanted to be able to Skype and surf the internet from the comfort of my bed, without resorting to using my iPhone, or having to unplug my computer and bring it to the bed. Being able to run games or movies AND connect with my friends around the world.\n\nI am still toying with and learning about the Tab 2, but so far it has been everything I wanted. I haven't abandoned my Kindle, but I enjoy being able to see color images from books and comics. Honestly I still prefer the e-ink format for prolonged reading, and the backlight (as expected) lessens battery time.\n\nConnectivity via GPS, wifi, and Bluetooth are all very stable. Android is a comfortable and easy to learn OS, Icecream Sandwich seems incredibly stable, and customization is elegant. Unfortunately the IR/Remote function does not work for me just yet, but I will experiment and work on it further- this was a novelty to me, and not key.\n\nNetworking in order to access files on my PC from my tablet is my next project."}

This is my only complaint so far about this tablet, but for some reason, it appears you cannot move apps to an external SD card, and moving files like photos/video (not sure about being able to move music files) to the SD card requires copying and pasting to the SD card via swapping between folders. You can set your default storage of photos/video via the camera app, but otherwise it's a bit of a chore to move files to the SD card. If you require/want external storage, you probably should look/should have looked into file transferring on this tablet and/or look into another tablet. While I don't plan on taking many photos/recording videos/listening to music on this tablet, I'll just deal with transfers for now. If not being able to easily transfer files is an Android version 4.0. X issue, then idk.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "When I finally decided to buy a tablet, I literally spent days researching everything that was out there.  For the price and features, the absolutely best deal is the Kindle Fire HD 7\", which I bought and love.  Unfortunately, the Kindle does not have Adobe Flash Player and it cannot be installed on the Kindle.  Since one of the primary reasons I wanted a tablet was to access websites that require Adobe Flash Player, I found the need to purchase another tablet.  From my previous research, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 had been my second choice, again for the price and features it offered.  The Galaxy Tab is exactly what I needed and performs flawlessly!  I love this tablet and recommend it for anyone who wants a small tablet that can do just about anything you want it to.  The price is excellent and the compact size makes it extremely versatile.  I can take it anywhere as it fits very nicely in my purse, even with the case on it.\n\nAdditionally, for those who need a tablet with Adobe Flash Player, this is the only tablet on the market that comes pre-loaded with AFP.  As of 08/15/12, Adobe is no longer producing AFP for Android systems and it is not available to download.  So, if you do not have it pre-loaded you will not be able to get it.  This may or may not be of consequence to you, but if it is then please take advantage of the days I spent researching all of this information.  For more information, please follow this link:  [...] OR do a search for Adobe Flash Player for Android and choose the \"Android's Flash Player is dead - live with it|ZDNet published on August 15, 2012 by David Meyer.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab is the only tablet in the $200 to $250 price range that has AFP.  I did not research the higher-end tablets since I had decided this was the maximum I was willing to spend.  I also did not research the lower-end tablets, under $150, as the majority of them have older operating systems like 2.2 or 2.3 and are only 4GB.  Technology continues to change too fast to spend any more money, in my opinion, as it will be obsolete in a very short period of time.\n\nIn closing, the Samsung Galaxy Tab is an awesome little piece of technology that I am sure you will thoroughly enjoy owning."}

I've only had one problem  with it it's the storage: if you are like me that i dind't buy this tablet as a gamer's tablet, but you know i enjoy some games sometimes, so on the second day i was really enjoying this tablet aand my friend showed me new need for speed most wanted game so i decided to download it (it was only 30mb) until i opened it and made me install 1.5gb of data for the game.the tablet is supposed to be 8gb but only has about 4.5gb of storage so i decided to buy a mini SD card for it 16gb was great for this (i recommend you buy a class 10 sd card), it turns out that you only have about 3gb for apps and you cannot install them in your SD card which is my BIGGEST PROBLEM, so after getting the need for speed gae i only have 1.8gb of internal storage left which sucks!!! what most people tell me is you should have bought nexus 7 16gb, but this one was 179.99, so i figured if it has a mini SD card slot, i can get how many ever apps i want, WRONGG! samsung should have been more clear on this on this description. thats my only and biggest problem and it is a deal breaker for me but oh well i guess i'll have to live with it!\n\nPros\n-price\n-fast\n-lighweight and compact\n-mid to high end product\n-great web browsing (i recommend Chrome)\n\nCons\n-Doesn't support apps on ext. SD card (deal breaker for some people)\n-4gb of internal storage out of the box (too much bloatware, crapware?)"}

The calendaring system works seamlessly with my Google calendar, but also gives me the option to store a calendar locally (something I wanted).  I can check any email account via IMAP, text via Google Voice, listen to music, set an alarm to wake me up.  The \"smart alarm\" feature is really cool...\n\nThe camera has no flash, but I didn't really buy this for the camera.  It also doesn't seem to have a microphone, but I could be wrong about that. I'll update when I figure that out, but I never use voice commands anyway.\n\nAnyway, reading e-books on this tablet is a real joy.  I use the Aldiko Android app for reading all my epub ebooks.  It has the wonderful day/night feature and allows you to adjust the brightness, something I could never do with my phone.\n\nThe tablet doesn't appear to be available on Amazon anymore, and I happened to catch it on sale for $199 before it went out of stock, but if you can find this product elsewhere, I highly recommend it."}

My mom has the kindle fire, after using it a couple times, it works much more efficiently than this thing. This tablet is SLOW. When you type on the keyboard it will not keep up with you. When you try to click things it way too often clicks the wrong thing, and you very very often have to try to tap them multiple times. The storage space is not much and mine was used within the first couple days so of course i use a microSD card. I do like how lightweight it is, and the cameras are okay. It's not very smooth at scrolling or moving between menus. The only real good thing, and a big part of why i bought it was running the current android market, but i hardly use apps anymore anyway.

I use it mostly for reading but have also found some of the applications useful for me.  However, I found that Samsung Kies, which is Samsung's software for backup, synching, and downloading firmware updates, wouldn't often recognize the tablet and I've never been able to update the firmware via Kies even though an update was available.  All updates so far have been done wirelessly through my home network.  Online support for this tablet via email to Samsung is useless. I have not been able to successfully navigate or complete all of the required information using their support process to complete an email.  That's been very frustrating! Samsung has been quite slow in upgrading from Ice Cream Sandwich to Jelly Bean and provides no schedule information whatsoever.  Rumors have it happening soon but that's all they are; rumors. This tablet is okay for my basic needs but I wouldn't recommend it now given all of the other 7\" tablets presently available.

It is a great device which I use almost daily for the past 2 weeks or so.  I have owned several Android phones and I like a lot of the Apps that I can get for free or for low price.  Once I configured my tablet, entering my Gmail address, all my apps were downloaded and installed on the new device.  Somehow, I got my contacts from my phone there too.  I guess I saved them to my Google account.  The screen is bigger than my HTC Amaze, which has a good size screen for a phone.  The battery life is a lot better than my phone's battery.  It lacks data connection, but it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so I use my phone's hot spot to get internet to the Tab when I am away from my Wi-Fi.  When I am sitting in my car, I use Bluetooth to connect to my sound system (CR-V).  The camera lacks zoom, but I found an application on Play Store (Camera ICS) which gives it zoom capability.

Something that really helped me in my decision was the fact that the galaxy has 2 cameras, and you can take photos, record videos and use it for many apps of video chat like Skype or ooVoo, but in the Fire, you have only a front camera that is only used for Skype video calls.\n\nOther thing that made me go for the galaxy is that you have access to the Google Play Store, and in the Kindle Fire you only have access to the Amazon app store, which has less number of apps than the Play store.\n\nDefinitely, the best 7 inch tablet is the Galaxy Tab 2. There are just a lot of cool features that I cannot mention all of them, but be sure that this one is a great choice."}

I wanted the microSD option that higher end tables didn't offer.\n\nPROS:\nYou can get a USB host adapter so you can plug USB devices into it.\n\nYou can use a bluetooth wireless keyboard and it responds quickly\n\nGood battery life.  9 hours of constant display use and days of battery life when I allow the screen to turn off while idle.\n\nVery slim and lightweight.\n\nCONS:\n\nPlacement of the power button next to the volume buttons isn't idle.  I keep hitting the power button by mistake and locking/powering off the screen.  Annoying.  It would have be better to have the power button on the top instead.\n\nAndroid lacks a decent alternative to Microsoft Office.  Opening Office documents from others tend to always have some formatting problem compared to actual Office programs.\n\nNo standard micro USB port for charging/data sync.  It'd be nice to not need an adapter to attach USB devices either.\n\nComes with lots of store apps.  More free media content would have been nice.\n\nNo 5.0ghz wireless support, but I prefer the lower price over that feature.\n\nWould have liked a 8.9 or larger screen size for the same price.\n\nNo LED notification light to alert you about e-mails or other notifications while main screen is asleep."}

Also, the apps load quite quickly and IR remote is a neat accessory; I actually prefer its channel guide over the one provided through my cable carrier. I've had no issues streaming movies through Netflix or watching videos on YouTube, although it would be nice if the Netflix movies were a bit clearer. Finally, it's extremely easy to drag photos or music from iTunes and drop them into Kies (the Galaxy software). Once you do this it will sync right up with the tab.\n\nAs for negatives, the power button and volume control are in a terrible location.

Initial impression was good - Nothing was broken or missing, no dead pixels, no screen flickering or nonexistent battery life.\n\nHaving tinkered with it for the past two days, I can say with absolute certainty that, short of it bursting into flames, I love this thing.\n\nThe screen is adequate - Not the best, but not even approaching bad. The tablet feels very solid, like a piece of equipment rather than a toy. Touchscreen is responsive, smooth, and hasn't lagged at all. 'Tis a fingerprint magnet, but that ought to be obvious.\n\nThe cameras are nothing to get excited about, but are neat to have. The speakers are probably one of my favorite parts of this tablet - While they aren't front-facing, neither are they on the back of the thing - They're located on the bottom edge, and louder than I expected.\n\nWifi is functional, with range on par with that of my phone (Samsung Infuse). Bluetooth works fine, with no complaints.\n\nBattery life is pretty decent, and it charges quickly. The Micro SD slot works fine, and the cover fits perfectly. Haven't used the IR, so I can't comment on that.\n\nOverall, I love this thing. While it certainly isn't the most powerful or shiny tablet out there, it is far, far more than enough for $199. My single complaint - and not about the tablet itself - is the charging cord. I don't mind it being Samsung's proprietary cable, but the thing is friggin' short. I can work around it, but it's still mildly annoying.\n\nWill update this review if anything changes."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is the first Android device I have ever owned.  I wouldn't say that I'm vehemently Apple-oriented, because my phone is still a Blackberry, but I am rather attached to my iPod touch.  I was pretty sure nothing could replace it.  I've owned both an iPad and a Kindle Fire, and as loyal as I am to Amazon, I gave my Kindle Fire to my son.  I really didn't like the user interface of the Fire, or not being able to run HBOGo, and I hated not being able to run Flash on my iPad.\n\nSo, I went shopping around.  When the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 came up for sale, a colleague and I went in halves for one.  We both wanted to try it, and decided that this would be the best way.  When it came, I had a bit of a ride on the learning curve, but after that, I found that I loved the platform.  Using, downloading, and installing apps/widgets is easy, uninstalling is also easy - the process is not difficult to find.  Email was a breeze to set up, and I now have shortcuts for 3 different email accounts.  Facebook and Twitter work flawlessly, and all the apps I bought when I had a Kindle Fire are available to me here.\n\nI was a bit concerned about my iTunes music.  I have a lot of classical music, and I wanted it available to me.  Google Play made that incredibly easy.  I still use my Amazon Cloud Player, which works great, and I downloaded and installed Dropbox so I can now share files much more easily between devices than I could before.\n\nI know that some people are descrying the fact that you can't save apps to the SD card.  Not an issue for me, as I am not a terribly heavy app user.  I have my favorite few, and that works for me.  I will probably get an SD card for pictures and music, so I don't think I will have to worry about device space being an issue.\n\nThe 7 inch size is perfect.  I hated the iPad - it was too big, but the Galaxy Tab's size is great.  Battery life has also been good.\n\nI'm really pleased with my purchase, and my Tab 2 has replaced my iPod touch.  For everything.  Thanks, Samsung (and Amazon!)\n\nEDITED 1/11/13\n\nI'm deducting one star from this review for the flimsiness and the length of the charging cord.  It's simply not sturdy enough - the wires are showing where the cord connects to the Tab, and because the cord is so short, it's difficult not to put pressure on the charger if you aren't sitting next to an outlet when you want to use it.  I realize that an extension cord would solve the problem, but I think that should be Samsung's job, not mine.  The charger does actually still work, so I am not taking more stars, but I will definitely have to look in to getting a replacement soon."}

I don't currently own a smart phone or a laptop; and did not really want a full 10 inch size tablet. I have found other reviews of it to be spot on. It actually was the perfect size to slip in a carry-on, and take everywhere with me. Not being a terribly technology-savvy person, I did find it easy to set up and use. I used the Samsung website to read the manual for any questions I had, and the site was quite helpful. I did add a 32GB memory card, as others have recommended, and found that it ran quite a bit faster. Even though I could expand the size of the page and type, using it for extended e-mails and internet use made me a bit bug-eyed! And it actually had about 5 hours of life on a battery charge; also charges fairly quickly. Using the Amazon APP store and website to download apps, music, and books from Kindle was incredibly easy.\n\nMy only negative is the cursed word-spelling prompts. On many occasions, I was not able to spell the name of a person or use a certain work because I could not override the word-spelling prompts. (Does anyone know if this feature can be turned off?)

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I generally like this tab. Has the latest Android OS, responds fast, offers multiple options. It seems, though, that most satisfied users compare this tab to a Kindle. I don't own a Kindle. But I do own an Acer Iconia which, performance-wise, supersedes the Galaxy Tab 7.0 even a year after it was released.\nThe reason I took the first star off is that ostensibly this Tab comes with 8GB - it's advertised as such, and says so on the box. However, what it does not say is that it most of its internal memory is taken up by the system and by numerous preloaded application that you can't get rid of. What you have out of the box is barely 4 GB of memory available for your use. If you think that's enough, think again.\nALL of the apps that you plan to download to your new pretty Galaxy are programed to go to your internal memory, and there is no option in the settings that allow you to move the app to your SD card. Samsung opted to label the internal memory as \"SDcard\" and the external memory as \"extSDcard.\" So not only do your apps go straight to your internal precious memory (of which you only have 4gb to begin with), all the data that's generated by that app also goes to the internal memory. The only thing that's possible to use out of external SD is media - videos and pictures.  Games, offline maps, word processing apps - all go to internal memory. I contacted Samsung on this before I bought the devise as I saw couple of users mentioning it here on Amazon. After 30 min of conversation with sales person and a TECH (!) department I was assured that I can move the apps to the external memory card. That's the reason for taking off a second star - incompetent customer service. I should have read reviews on Samsung website - all this was discussed by users there.\nDon't know if I'll keep it, aside from the above reasons the Tab is fine, especially at this price point."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I am what you would call a power user. I was looking for a 7 inch tablet after using and returning an ASUS Transformer due to its size and lack of video codecs. I needed a small tablet to read books, surf the web, play games, take class notes, and watch videos. After being disappointed at the Amazon locked Kindle Fire, not wanting to pay a high premium for an iPad, and the Nexus 7 lacking an expandable storage option, I found the Tab 2 7.0 a worthy tablet that hits all the points important to me.\n\n- Affordable. After being released at a good price of $250 this tablet has hit the magical $199 price point shipped on Amazon. An amazing price for what you get.\n\n- Launched with Android 4.0.4 but now has Android 4.1 Jelly Bean! This update has made the tablet quicker and much more responsive due to Project Butter. The layout has changed and is now more consistent between different devices. Google Apps are updated with better performance. Google Now shows cards based on your location and your Google searches. A much need update has breathed new life into this tablet. Update is available automatically on start up or via Settings, Software, Software Update.\n\n- Battery Life and Performance. I easily get 6.5 hours of \"on screen time\" for heavy use and have gone a couple of days without needing a charge. Over 8 hours for video (will vary due to brightness). An excellent duration. YMMV. With a TI OMAP 4430 Dual Core Processor, Performance is good. It is an older processor to keep the price low but is more than capable of running this tablet. No issues. Power Saver Mode provides longer battery without any noticeable decrease in performance. Brightness is allowed to be much darker than normal. Good for night reading.\n\n- Expandable Storage. With 8GB of internal storage and about half user-accessible, expandable storage is important for those with a big library of music and videos. I can store all my shows and movies on any size microSD. The tablet also plays MKVs, Xvid, and other important video formats with srt embedded or external subs support in the default Video Player and MX Player. Tested 720p. I am currently using a 16GB microSD Class 10 card.\n\n- Features. WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, Front and Rear Cameras(Google Hangout is great), Good Dual Core Processor (TI OMAP 4430), 1 GB RAM, 4.5GB user accessible internal memory for apps, microSD Slot, and an IR Blaster (Peel App controls my TV and DVR flawlessly(Samsung HDTV + RCN Motorola DVR)).\n\n- The Tablet. Great build. Good screen at 7\" and 1024 by 600 resolution. Easy to hold. Lightweight.\n\nThe cons that are easily overlooked\n- Proprietary charge cable (prefer microUSB)\n- Camera quality is not very good (I would never use a tablet as a camera... Good for QR Codes and video chat though!)\n\nLike I said this tablet hits all the points important to me. Couldn't ask for a more balanced tablet in terms of hardware, software, price, and features. At $199 as of Jan 16, 2012, I highly recommend this tablet."}

One of the best selling points for this for me was the size and the fact that even though it comes with 8gig of memory, with roughly 4 used for the os and pre-installed software, I can ADD a 32gig card, which is what I did.\nIt's quick and does what I want and need."}

After all, I had my laptop for gaming, my netbook for traveling ... WHY did I need another computer like 'toy'???\n\nFrom the minute it arrived and I put it on the charger, I could not resist playing around with it to see exactly what it could do. I explored the app store, which previously was only available to me on my phone, and poked around in the games, something I'd not bothered with on my phone, due to the small screen.  What a MOST pleasant surprise it was to be able to sit and enjoy games, looking around on the internet, or reading (I transferred some of my Kindle content to my Tab).  The light weight of this Tab is easy on the hands/wrists, even for extended periods of time. It can snap a quick picture if I need to, check my email, allow me to browse the web for something that pops into mind, and get some of my favorite phone apps as well. I became an instant fan!\n\nMy hubby, who is not tech minded, saw me playing with it and commented it looked like fun. First time I got a chance, I purchased another for him - which he is enjoying greatly. The great thing about this Tab is: it's designed for easy accessibility, and you don't have to understand a lot about tech to fully enjoy it. It makes his little handheld individual games obsolete, and he is really having a great time playing old favorites, as well as trying out a few new ones. Since he has now retired, it will be something he can really enjoy using any time of the day.\n\nThe slim size of this Tab allows me to take it AND my Kindle when I'm out somewhere I know I'll have to be waiting. Best of both worlds, in a convenient size ... I'm in heaven!! If you are waffling about getting one of these little gems ... grab it now! You won't be sorry!!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "This is my 2nd \"touch' device after my iPod Touch 4gen and it has certainly been a learning experience. A few negatives future buyers might like to know:\nDoesn't include headphones or FM antennae (Galaxy Players include them); the built in camera app doesn't work outdoors after update to 4.0.4 (it still does video and other camera apps work though); the 3mp rear camera doesn't have a flash or auto-focus (picture quality is only on par with the 1mp rear iPod camera); the WiFi connectivity, though adequate so far, is not as good as the iPod Touch; the IR port \"Peel\" app is very limited so don't buy this thinking you are getting a universal remote; it is nearly impossible to find a TPU, silicone gel or hard case for the Tab 2, only big leather type covers\n\nWhat $199 does get you vs. some other $199 devices:\nA functioning GPS (no GPS antennae in the $299 iPod Touch 5 or $199 Kindle Fire HD); a wall plug ($20 extra for KF HD); a rear camera and microSD slot (not on either KF HD or Google Nexus)\n\niOS 5.0 vs Android 4.0.4:\nIt has taken me several days to learn Android, it's about the same difference as PC vs. Mac I suppose (I hate MacOS and Finder). There are several apps missing I would like as everyone has noted elsewhere, and the \"same' apps don't all work the same. I do like all the info Android makes available in settings and options which puts you in control, but if you want to sit back and enjoy the ride iOS might be more for you.\n\nEDIT: The iPad mini was just announced at $329 without GPS, similar screen resolution (1024x780) and better camera, but probably too wide to hold in my hand, so I'm still ok buying this for $199. If the mini were $229 I might have had regrets."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I ordered the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 in July 2012, and actually had to exchange it for the same item just over a month later. The issue: it will shut down without warning, even with a charged battery. This is actually an issue I've had with the replacement tab that I've had since the end of August as well. There is no warning when this happens, it just does. It isn't \"frequent\" but I would say it occurs a couple times a month. Generally, I have to plug the charger back in (which is strange b/c there is ALWAYS a charge when it shuts down) and then after a few minutes, I can power the tablet back on and it's fine. It's an inconvenience, but it's not worth the effort of me exchanging it for a 2nd time and I believe I'm past the point of returning it at this time. I will cope.\n\nI read A LOT of review of this tablet before I settled on it. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 definitely had some mixed reviews, but I opted to go for it as I thought, no product is 100% perfect (that's definitely been confirmed for me). It does the job it's supposed to for the most part, I prefer the 7inch size as it's more manageable to hold on to.\n\nWould I recommend it to a friend?

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "The bad first: 1) Just bought it, and was very disappointed when I turned it on and the colors looked washed out, no matter what I did. I had heard so much about the presumably beautiful screen and I just don't see it. The colors are not dynamic at all, just drab, compared to the beautiful,  vivid screen on my galaxy S2 phone. ( I am longingly viewing the two and comparing them as I write this. Where has all the vibrancy gone on the tablet screen...) Chatted with Samsung online, recommendation was to reset the tab, which I did but but it made no difference. Anyone have a remedy? 2)Lack of a micro hdmi slot for hd tv connection. Although I knew this was not a built in feature, I did not know that you cannot even get a decent HDMI adapter for it the way you can for other tablets. 3)Why no apps can be moved to the micro sd card is a mystery to me. Should be easy to fix? 4)I have not (yet)discovered a way to download videos etc. to the external sd card directy. When I download videos, pix, music etc.  I have to download to the internal memory and then use cut and past via 'my files'. At least that's what I've been doing. So the internal memory fills up very fast and you have to keep moving things. Is there a way to download directly to external card?\nThe good: 1)I love the 'allshareService' app, eliminates some of the hdmi connection peeve I have. I can play my media files on my sony tv at the touch of a button, full screen, beautifully done, but the tv has to be capable of receiving files. Don't know if this is a Samsung app or if it is part of the ICS package. 2) wifi and cpu works very fast, no glitches as others have mentioned. I had several downloads going at the same time last night as well as using the tab for other things and it worked like a charm, no hang ups etc. 3) Overall works very smoothly, and has a nice intuitive feel. Feels 'coordinated' in terms of all the different features, very easy to navigate. 4) Love that you can change fonts for your tablet. I used to have this feature on my old LG dlite phone and am delighted to see it on my new tab. 5) Online manual is well organized and covers the main questions well. Its easy to download to the tab. 6) Battery lasts longer than I anticipated, can't put an hour value on it but I used it heavily for hours yesterday without charging.\nSo, overall, it is an excellent tab, but I really expected, and want, a more vibrant color scheme on my screen and there does not seem to be an option to adjust that.\n\nEdit: So disappointing: Three days after writing this review, the 'allshareService'application,which I loved because it allowed me to stream easily from tab to sony google tv to my galaxy S2 phone, was no longer to be found on my tablet. Called tech support four times, they said the issue was 'elevated to the next level' as it appeared the app had become deactivated and they had to find a way to reactivate it. They finally said the allshareService app had been discontinued (not aailable for download anywhere)and that only a new app, called 'allshare play' is now available. Well, guess what: allshare play is not compatible with my google tv and, even worse, my Samsung s2 phone does not recognize \"allshare play\" so I just lost the easiest and most important function I had for streaming of video, music ect. on this tab. It turns out \"allshare play' is only compatible with two or three Samsung devices. Beware!! I just lost the main reason for liking this tab."}

Probably it was because I didn't have any tablet before.\n\nI am using an iPhone 4 and I have tried using an iPad and a Kindle, so I know what it feels like touching the screens of those machines.\nAnd this is my first Android machine and I don't know if it is an Android thing or a Samsung thing honestly, but it was very hard to touch the keyboard and not to make any mistake.\nSo I tried using voice keyboard instead, which was a lot worse than Google's built-in voice search, and it made me soon give up.\nWell, at this point it was acceptable. I could have adapted.\n\nBut, because Galaxy Tab 2 uses an OS version (Ice Cream Sandwich) that is not compatible with some of the apps that I wanted to use (e.g., ubersocial), it was frustrating to find that my new tablet won't be as useful as I expected.\n\nI was going to accept all the shortcomings because the price was reasonable and I needed a tablet anyway.\nBut it STOPPED WORKING a week after purchase. Yeah. I am returning it.\n\nOne more thing. Listening to music on this Tab was specifically difficult. I still do not know how to sort the songs. The menu is quite confusing. Not as instinctively easy as iOS devices.\n\nOh, and Adobe Flash Player! It didn't work. The most disappointing thing. It is different from what the advertisement says. Don't be deceived.\n\nI didn't feel like 8GB was too small, though. But considering the large screen, you'll probably want to see video on this portable machine (unless you have a bigger tablet) and will get to patronize YouTube more (I did) or may feel like storing as many videos as you like and see it whenever you want. I have WiFi in my home so that was no problem with the Dropbox storage Samsung gave out additionally, although I know it will expire after 1 year.\n\nPlus, I liked the weight and the grip. It is not too heavy at all but still gave a relatively good feeling when I grabbed it. Again, if it had not been broken, I would have used it anyway. Too bad."}

Easy to carry and hold in one hand for extended periods of time.\n- Excellent resolution for reading newspapers/books, listening to podcasts or watching downloaded movies.\n- Battery charge is great - gives me about 6 hours of reading time.\n\nNeutral\n- Samsung's Kies application is a good first attempt to access your tablet from a browser on your PC - similar to how you control IPad through ITunes. One big limitation is it does not let you manage your apps (add, delete, move screens, etc).\n- Pairs nicely with other samsung products - Blue Ray player, TV - but works mostly as a remote.\n\nCons\n- You can spend money and buy an SD-Card but you can't really use it with this tablet. There is no way to move apps from internal memory to SD-Card, download videos directly on your tab to the external SD-Card. What's the point of the Lobotomized SD-Card then? Nice design decision, Samsung. Kudos to the product manager.\n\nRecommendations to Samsung\n- Allow the external SD-Card to be used as an extension of internal storage.\n- Allow watching whatever is on your screen on the tablet on TV or Blue Ray player.

The battery life is good, if you turn off wifi when there is none around and bluetooth when you don't need it, the tablet lasts most of the day.  I like the fact that you are not restricted to use Android App market.  The peel app is nothing to write home about, kinda disappointing.  I like the internal GPS the larger screen is safer while I am driving and it doesn't tie up my phone.  Very enjoyable tablet and would recommend,  its not the most powerful one on the market, but consider what you want to use it for."}

But now that I have had it a while problems are starting to show themselves. First of all updates take forever and use up much battery power. Secondly I am not able to acces my email anymore. I have tried everything I can to regain that access to no good. Is it a matter of you get what you pay for? My email was one of the biggest reasons I bought this tab and if I can`t resolve this soon it is no better than a paper weight for 268 dollars! So buy with caution."}

I had no support from manufacturer for a simple task of transfering music files from my computer to the Tab and Play, it only plays if you keep buying and if needs resetting, well touigh luck.

I purchased the Student Offer (came with the keyboard dock for charging) from Costco and was a great buy.  And, I loved it however, after 1 month it froze up and you could not even power it off.  Returned it to Costco and they replaced it with another one.  When I powered it up the screen was totally different than the first one. The on screen keyboard was much smaller then the orig. tablet had.  I finally realized it was set up for a phone.  After numerous, numerous updates the tablet had the screen and keyboard same as the first tablet.  Still could not access some programs as it constantly said \"there is a difference between the  device and server of more than 2 hrs and 10 minutes.\"  After trying to set the time with ALL the time zones listed and still not being able to come to the time the device wanted.  E-mailed Samsung and chatted via computer with a representative who finally told me to return it to the store as it must be defective - now that was 2 of them.  I gave up and returned the second one to Costco - thank goodness for their 90 return policy. I saved myself any more aggravation and purchased an I-Pad2 which has been a dream compared to the nonsense with the Galaxy.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I'm sure none of you need a 492nd opinion (as of this writing) but I am so impressed by this tablet, I feel compelled to write about it.  I should point out that I bought this elsewhere (sorry Amazon - it was easier to return if I didn't like it and it was less expensive) and it's the Student Edition, which includes a USB link and an attachable keyboard.  Both are great and I highly recommend this edition if you can find it.\n\nI agonized comparing this to the Fire HD and Nexus 7.  Recognizing each has pluses and minuses, I finally made the plunge with the Galaxy Tab and am glad I did.  It is everything I wanted in a tablet\n\nTo put my review in perspective, I didn't want a tablet for playing games, viewing movies, listening to music, or mainly shopping.  I wanted a lightweight piece of hardware that would allow me to access the internet, as well as maintain my calendar, contacts, to-do lists, and other general \"workhorse\" tasks.  The Galaxy Tab does all of this amazingly and as I've found, far more.\n\nThe Good:\n1. It has the best calendar program I've ever used (including Palm, Apple, Google).\n2. The display, though less than its competition, is clear and adequate for my purposes.\n3. Battery life has been great, and I've been putting it through its paces.  As other reviewers note, you have to be mindful of what's running.  The Tab allows killing programs easily, turning WiFi and Bluetooth on and off quickly, and generally tweaking to your heart's content.\n4. Navigation is fantastic and fully customizable.\n5. Touch is for the most part, responsive (see below for so-so.)\n6. It has voice dictation that is highly accurate and makes composing emails, searches, etc. very easy.  It's not perfect but then again, neither is Dragon.\n7. WiFi performance has been excellent.  I'm not sure why some reviewers have had problems but I haven't.  At home, on the train, and at work, this has picked up, identified, and connected quickly, and maintained the connection even with weak signals.\n8. The customizable universal remote is FANTASTIC.  I am having so much fun with it.  It's not perfect but it's good enough.\n9. I was worried about performance given that the processor is lower speed than its competition and only dual core.  Also, this is the older version of the Android OS.  My fears were unfounded.  This has performed quickly and responsively with everything I've thrown at it, including real multi-tasking.\n10. The USB dongle included in this edition is also great.  I've moved files and so far, avoided having to get a micro-SD card.\n11. Though I keep thinking I should have gone for the 16 GB version, so far, I haven't eaten away that much of the storage.  And I see the micro-SD as a solution should I need more.\n12. I've accessed my entire Kindle library and the entire Android market with ease.  The Tab holds its own to the competition.\n13. Internet usage is smooth, fast, and I haven't experienced any clipping.\n14. It reads and allows editing of MS Office products admirably, as well as reading pdf's.\n\nThe So-So:\n1. Touch response is usually fast but sometimes lags.  I've found that sometimes it's because my other hand is overlying the screen somewhat, but there are occasions where I have to keep tapping.\n2. The feel of the screen is dampened by a plastic overlay, so this lacks the smoothness of moving your fingers over true glass.\n3. The overlay is a true fingerprint magnet.\n4. The camera isn't that great (haven't used it for Skype yet) but this isn't what I want in a tablet anyway.\n5. No manual on the device.  I personally don't tend to read them and enjoy finding my way around hardware and software but others might be daunted.  The manual is available on Samsung's website (and other reviewers have given links in this forum) but it would have been nice if they had included it.\n\nThe Bad:\n1. As others have noted, placement of some icons, and particularly with the keyboard, are awkward.  I've taken too many screenshots with the camera than I care to admit.\n2. Syncing software with their calendar and Outlook proper (not Exchange) would be great but is absent.  There are low cost options in the Android market but then you lose Galaxy's wonderful calendar (I think - I haven't bought any syncing software yet.)\n\nWith this market, the Galaxy Tab is fast becoming \"old\" but I think it is a very viable choice.  My review may be too late to the party, but I'm so in love with it, I thought it proper to put it in writing.\n\nUPDATE 10-18-2012\nStill loving it.  Maybe even more.  My two \"Bad\" comments above have been addressed. Taking inadvertent pics with the camera from the bottom screen has been fixed as you can program that area to do other things.  And Samsung's own \"Kies\" software syncs its wonderful calendar with Outlook!\n\nThis tablet is the very productivity pad I wanted.  With free android apps like Evernote, I'm able to keep my personal and professional life well-organized.  The only hiccup I've experienced is that it sometimes chokes a little on large pdf's (such as the electronic manual to this).  But other pdf's don't faze it at all.\n\nOh, and for me, the battery life is great.  But I practice conservation: shutting down apps I'm not using, turning off wifi when in sleep mode, etc.."}

It sat along side several other higher priced tablets (7\" and 10\") and performed a lot better than the others.  The speed was pretty good (of course, that depended on the store's wi-fi).  I had been looking at the New Kindle Fire HD, but might just go for this device, instead.  Every app that I tried to find was in Google Play (most low-end Androids don't even have Google Play) and every website that I searched came up quickly.  I will update this review after I have bought one and tried it out for a few months.  But, my first impression was very good."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "While I waited for the new Kindle HD to come out to replace my old Kindle Keyboard 3G, I had been reading about all the different tablets that are out there.  The more I used my smartphone, a Droid Maxx, the more I wanted a tablet so I could do the same stuff only on a larger screen including reading my Kindle books.  After the arrival of the  new Kindle I got serious about comparison tablet shopping. I decided that I wanted to keep the same size as my old kindle - not the screen size but overall size as you can hold it in one hand and its very portable in a purse etc.  I also didn't want the high price iPad or the new Windows tablet. (I have a laptop for serious work.)  So I eventually narrowed down the choice between the Kindle Fire HD, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\" and the Google Nexus. After much analysis and reading reviews I chose the Galaxy for the following reasons: While I love Amazon, I prefer to stay with the Andriod OS so that I don't have to learn a whole other way of life and can set up my devices similiarly; For about $40 more the Galaxy is expandable with a 32GB memory card and it has a front & rear camera;  the Nexus costs more isn't expandable and only has one camera. These are just a few reasons.  I have forgotten the rest cause I am so pleased with my choice.  I have owned it for 4 days now and have some basic things set up on it and will start to play with the camera etc. I had no problems with it recognizing our WiFi. I just have to remember to turn off the WiFi to save the battery life as I did on my Kindle.\n\nI bought the Supcase cover for it which fits perfectly and allows for 3 viewing positions and great protection.  I had purchased clear screen protectors but have now ordered non-glare ones as I like to read outside and prefer not to see my reflection while reading!  I spent alot of time studying all the information on the tablets, screen protectors and cases and I am very pleased with my choice and the prices from Amazon.\n\n10/10/12  Yesterday I received the Clear Shield Utra Matte finish screen protectors.  It works great...no more glare but you do loose a litte in clarity but worth it outdoors.  The protector was easy to put on and a perfect fit.  My husband is now playing Bad Piggies on it and I think I may have him convinced to get this tablet too.  Wait til tries the TV remote set-up!"}

I'm having horrible problems connecting to my home wi-fi which I'm finding to be a common problem after an internet search on how to fix it (Google \"gaxlaxy tablet won't connect to wi-fi\").

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "This tablet was released in a time when the market was hungry for a cheap-yet-decent tablet experience. You were either stuck buying a crappy Vizio (or other value brand) tablet, the locked-down Kindle Fire, or spending huge wads of cash on a 10-inch device that was clumsy and bulky to hold. Samsung apparently saw the market niche and jumped on it.\n\nThis is not a premium tablet. Instead it's targeted at people who want a \"good enough\" tablet experience while keeping a reasonable price point. There's some tasks the tablet is \"good enough\" for, and other tasks that some people might find lacking.\n\nI primarily use this thing to read books and watch YouTube and Netflix in bed. The 7-inch screen is totally suitable when your face is close to it (much less eye-strain than trying to watch extended video playback on the 4-inch screen of a smartphone). I've spent many blissfully relaxed hours watching stuff on this tablet, with the added ego boost of knowing it's much more electrically efficient than watching the same content on my desktop computer.\n\nLess frequently I use the tablet for listening to music (media players are a joy to use on the bigger-than-a-smartphone screen, with the album art showing up huge and pretty), web browsing (Google News and articles on various sites), online chat (through IRC an client), and all the other uses you'd expect to get out of an Android device. Email, social networks, image browsing, screwing around with the camera for the lulz, etc etc etc.\n\nThere are a two minor flaws I've noticed. The stock web browser seems a bit laggy and buggy at times and the music player occasionally suffers brief hiccups in playback, though this may have been fixed in a software update, as I haven't heard this problem recently. On that note, Samsung has been supporting this product really well. For the 3-4 months since I've gotten it, I think the device has received.... five software updates? It's always nice to see a manufacturer standing behind a product post-sale.\n\nSo, the verdict. It's not a premium device, but it is excellent for the price, and good enough for my tablet needs. Even as it's made depreciated by newer 7-inch tablets, I plan on using it and loving it for a long time yet."}

But since I bought this tablet in July, I found it acceptable for journaling as well.  The typing does take some getting use to but I manage.  It is definitely slower than with a keyboard.  But I think all I need is some practice.  A third way to use this tablet is remote desktoping to my work computer.  It gives you instant access to everything I have at my desktop via WiFi at work.  Get the \"2X\" app for remote desktopping.\n\nFinally, I use the PDAnet to connect this tablet to the internet via my phone.  I have an HTC phone and don't have hotspot support (didn't pay for it).  So I use the BlueTooth tether feature from PDAnet.  Works great for reading news and web browsing.\n\nThe camera leave something to desire, though.

Not only that, most of the applications for the Tab2 have to be downloaded from Google play.

Photos and videos, unless shot in bright outdoor light, are disappointing. But apart from that, extremely happy with it."}

The problem I have is there is no User Manual with the purchase and the options you have are (a) download a 228-page pdf document or (b)  buy a manual in addition to the price you have already paid for the unit.  Samsung claims it has \"documentation\" but what they provide is a tiny booklet called \"Quick Start Guide\" for which you need a magnifying glass to read. and with it is a 119-page \"Health & Safety and Warranty Guide\" in one half of the booklet and the same information in Spanish. This booklet is 2-1/2 inches by 4 inches in size! Nothing in that tells you how to use the unit.\nIf I had known these limitations I would not have had the unit bought for my daughter.  I spent most of an hour on their chat line about requesting a user manual at no charge and the end result was Samsung answer was that it has joined the environmental consciousness movement - what that means is they want YOU to print out the manual and use 228 pages of paper so they don't have to. And when I requested a further \"escalation\" of my request, I was told to provide a mobile phone number which I don't have."}

The phone is 2 years old.\nI purchase the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 in hopes that it would do certain things that the Epic phone cannot do. Unfortunately the opposite is true. The Tablet using Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.4 will not do many of the things the older phone will do.\nAfter only having the Tablet for 2 months I have already had to return the Tablet back for replacement because the camera did not work correctly. I received my replacement Tablet and the camera still does not work as it should. I installed the Face Book App and in less than a week it completely wiped the Tablets ability to do searches in every single program on the Tablet. After trying everything that could be done I finally had no choice but to do a full restore and restart the Tablet from scratch.\n\nI just installed the US Postal Service app on my phone and went to do the same on the Tablet and the Tablet informed me that the US Postal Service app is not supported. WOW, does it get any more pathetic.\n\nMany of the programs which work great on the phone are at best poor performers on the Tablet.\n\nWhen typing in any of the programs try moving the curser to the end of a sentence. Good Luck. The curser jumps all over the page and does what it wants and not what you want it to do. I attempted do this review on the Tablet but was simply not able to do so because I could not keep the curser in one place long enough to make the review.\n\nBattery life is pathetic. At best, steady use 2 hours. With all programs turned off and the tablet not in use, 24 hours if your lucky.\n\nThe touch screen if so insensitive that you have to push the screen hard at times to get a response out of it.\n\nHad I known that this Tablet performs so poorly I would have never bought it.\n\nSamsung I trusted you in the past. I will never trust you again. Like the saying Burned once \"Your Bad\"  Burned twice \"My Bad\"\nI will not get burned by Samsung's failed attempts at making bad Tablets. Next time I try the IPad.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I bought this when it was at height of price point. Now price is coming down sharply, not sure why. This device really is amazing. I have an iPad2 (16gb / wifi) and I like the Galaxy Tab 2 better because it is light and the right form-factor for bedtime reading. Mostly use the iPad on a table or lap, but this I can hold in front of my face while laying down to read. The Galaxy Tab 2 is vastly lighter than iPad 2. My only druther is that I wish all android devices came with a configuration setting to enable root access instead of a long, laborious process requiring a development environment, and a dangerous process that risks \"bricking\" the device rendering it useless, just to enable root access. It's ridiculous.\n\nI also use the Galaxy Tab 2 for android development and the new android OS (4+) is such a leap forward from versions 2 and 3. I just love the 7\" screen and think it's the ideal balance for reading and using applications. The device itself is robust, usable, stable, and high performance. Which is probably why Samsung has gotten into trouble with Apple. Because they copied the things they did well. Apple worked hard to steal those patents in the first place. Off my soapbox now... Get one of these before they are gone, can't beat the price."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "**Edit: Without going back through the review, I must point out that after some discussion in the thread below it was exposed that while there may be several apps that allow themselves to be ported back and forth, this is not the norm and you should, for all intensive purposes accept this as a device that does not currently support moving apps to the SD card. Given this, if I have some time this week I'll root it and get back with whether or not that helps at all.\n\nThis tablet has everything I wanted in a 7\"'er, and I'm so impressed I'm thinking of replacing my ASUS ep121 with the 10.1 model for school and work usage. This tablet booted straight up out of the box, I inserted a preformated 64gig mSD card, which it took to without a single hitch, and proceeded to fill it with all my standard android apps (I've been using android since before it's retail release). The tablet's only irritating features, are that it does not support apps to SD, and when plugged into a 3.5mm jack it automatically turns itself down to near inaudible levels, when you turn it back up, it covers a chunk of the screen with some stupid warning about loud noise and ear damage... While I understand loud noise can certainly damage your hearing, I doubt if many people are in danger of doing this with their mid sized tablets.\n\nVs. the Original Fire\n\nI bought this with the first week of its release, and I preordered the fire, what I'm saying is, I have extensive experience with both... And because of that I don't understand the comparisons people are drawing. The Fire was never meant to be a full range experience, it's meant to be an ereader that handles color pictures. The fact amazon decided to add in web surfing or netflix support was them just testing the water. They didn't expect the tablet to sell like it did, and they didn't intend for people to use them the way they are.\n\nThis on the other hand is a legitimate tablet, in a seven inch formfactor. You can read the specs, I'm not going to type them out again. But the web browsing is quick, I've only had one issue with firefox on it, and I simply reinstalled, not another issue since, using iSyncr I loaded it with all my playlists and top rated songs (wirelessly), the newest iteration of iSyncr even records your playcounts. The offline GPS function of google maps has not worked once on here, but tethered it works fine. I have synced with multiple bluetooth devices, and it handles swapping  between them MUCH better than my Galaxy SII. The only real problem I have with it, is that samsung backed it up with complete trash for peripherals. Do not buy the samsung car stands or any of that stuff, there are plenty of bundles and alternatives by third parties (which I have reviewed) that work very, very well in comparison.\n\nVs. the Nexus\n\nI'm an ASUS fanboy, I love their components, but the omission of the mSD slot in the feature list for the GNexus is what made me grab this one and cancel my GNexus preorder. However, I recently spent the entire day with the two side by side, and I can tell you empirically that any differences are subjective interpretations. The screens are not so different that your eyes will melt, the speeds of function are not so different that you'll rue the day you paid for a samsung product, and when you start showing off all the content you have stored locally, the opposition gets sad... especially when you bring up how much youtube content is blocked to mobile browsing.\n\nIn my opinion, the SGT7 is a clear victor here. I didn't walk away wish I'd bought a nexus, in fact I drove away with my SGT7 in the windshield clamp jamming to music off it and a giant smile on my face.\n\nThe bottom line from my perspective is this:\n\nIf you want a seven incher, that will handle all your basic media consumption and net needs, plus a few other things, this is it.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Polaris office (which comes preinstalled) is the best MS office alternative offered for ANY tablet device."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I was excited about it for the first few weeks, but I've run into a number of limitations that have me questioning this purchase:\n\nI can't move Apps to the SD card. While the box says it's an 8GB device, expandable with an SD Card (32 GB) the reality is different. 4GB are available to use, the other 4 held by the OS. 4 GB might be a lot for some, but try installing a few Gameloft Games, and suddenly you are out of space with no option to move the data over to the SD card. What's the point of a 32GB SD card? Photos? Unfortunately, that doesn't really work either. Photos taken with the camera seem to show up on the SD card, but if you use any fancy Apps for taking or editing pictures, they are on the device - not the SD card. Photos downloaded from Flickr or Picassa using different Gallery Apps also stay on the device. After syncing a gallery app with Flickr, my device was full again.\n\nI cannot mount this device to either of my computers. They both run variations of Ubuntu (Linux) but this device will not mount no matter what I try (and I've tried lots of options offered by the internet). I've downloaded drivers for the MTS mounting system, switched USB debugging on and off, and tried connecting it as a camera. No dice. Can't connect. Can't transfer files. My 2 year old Android phone and my iPod touch both connect and transfer files to the same computers with no hassles!\n\nIf I try to just plug the SD card into my computer and manually add music and videos, I get all sorts of errors trying to write to the card. Plug it into the tablet, and they're not there. In fact, the only thing on the SD card is a DCIM folder with pictures from the default camera app, and LOST.DIR. No other folders can be added. No other folders exist on the card. the 32 GB card is completely empty but for a dozen pictures yet the device itself is full.\n\nI bought this device for the smaller form factor and to avoid the Apple walled garden, but it seems just as bad (if not worse) on the Samsung side of the fence. Booo. I'm going to have to jailbreak this thing and start over. I can't believe I have to jailbreak an Android device to make it connect to a Ubuntu computer. So much for open!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Let me begin this review by saying that this is the best tablet that i ever used!!!!!!! What I mean by that is that this tablet is extremely fast and responsive. I been using Apple products for many years now, and this tablet by FAR superior to any Apple tablet that I have used. Battery life is very long, I get app 8-9 hrs of heavy use before I need to charge it again. Screen is bright and very crisp, and for 7in tablet that is purely AMAZING!!!! This tablet supports FLASH, which apple does not. Yes you need to download it from other source since Adobe stopped the support for tablets with 4.0+ OS, but it only takes few minutes and very easy to do even for me. External memory slot is a definite plus in my book, since you can add music and movies to your SD, without using your internal memory for those items. The last thing is the price, for a new tablet 250$ it is relatively cheap, apple is 2x that so this was a SUPER deal in my opinion. People compare Galaxy Tab2 with the new Nexus 7 which is 199$ in GOOGLE  store, but they don't take into consideration that GOOGLE will charge them 199$ for the tablet + tax + like 20$ for shipping, and that's the price for 8gig model with NO MICRO SD CARD SLOT!!!! Yes for some people that might be a great deal since its faster, but you get much more for the buck when you purchase Samsung Galaxy Tax 2 7.0!!!!!!!!"}

As it turns out, the device really grew on me, especially the IR capabilities which allow me to control my extensive home theater devices.  In addition, my job involves quite a bit of travel and the Samsung is a great device for traveling since it's smaller than the iPad.\nIt has a fantastic display and Android allows you the ability to customize it with active themes and personalized widgets.  The device is easier to handle than the iPad, and in landscape mode the navigation buttons are easily reached with your thumbs.\nThe only real negative are the apps.  There's no question that Apple has a better selection of Apps, especially for kids.  You would think developers would actually devote more effort to the Android OS since there are more devices running Android than IOS.  I think once Android catches up from a development perspective, Apple is going to have real trouble.  The Galaxy S3 phone for example is light years ahead of the 4S and will still be a better device than the iPhone 5.\n\nThe other negative as others have noted is that the battery life isn't as great as the iPad.

Samsung has done a great job with this tablet making it very intuitive and functional. I am using it for business as well as personal. It is working well for all my Microsoft Office functions I need to use it for. Still getting used to there Polaris office program. Battery seems fairly long lasting and it syncs well with all my laptop programs I work with. Great tablet. I would definitely recommend this product."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Overall this is a wonderful tablet.  I got the 8GB student edition (with the keyboard) for $249.99 at Best Buy.  I went with this model over the Nexus 7 for two reasons, 1. camera, 2. expandable memory.  I figured that a good 32GB micro SD card will only cost me around $25 to I could have 40GB on my tablet and still but under the $300 mark.\n\nThe only complaint, and it's a big one for me, is you CANNOT move applications to the SD Card.  This has to be something Samsung has done by design because moving applications is native to the Android OS.  I even tried loading the Android SDK and forcing applications to load on external storage, no go.  My only option here would be to root the device which I do not want to do.\n\nSamsung, if you are reading these reviews, please, please fix this in an update.  The expandable memory is one of the reasons I bought this tablet over the Nexus 7.  Once this news gets out, you may lose business to the Nexus 7.  I do not wish to root my device but if space becomes and issue, I will.\n\nAgain, wonderful tablet, just remove this ridiculous restriction that is native to the OS."}

I have to admit, my choice was really based on price more than anything, but I must admit this little thing is a gem.  I've found the processor snappy, and I've not had issues with lag or lockup.  The bloatware isn't as bad as some I've seen, and some of the programs are actually quite handy.  Heck, the remote control for my tv would have probably convinced me to buy it based on that alone if I'd known about it before....  for those that haven't seen it, picture a universal remote that allows you to search for content and manage your dvr.  The camera isn't the greatest, as noted, but I doubt i'll ever use it.  Display is perfectly adequate, 32gb micro sd ensures i'll probably never run out of storage.  It lacks a usb, but I'm ok with that mostly.  All in all, I love it.  I'd buy it again."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I am a techno geek who is adamantly against all things Apple (I don't like how obsolete their products get in a relatively short amount of time) so I was looking for an alternative to shelling out $500 for an iPad.  I discovered the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.  I had been looking at the Kindle Fire but found the stripped down version of the Android operating system to be too limiting.  Enter the Galaxy Tab.  It was in my price range, could do everything I needed, had a slot for micro SD cards for my media, was by Samsung which is a company I've had luck with before, and the reviews that I saw were mostly positive.\n\nI went to a local shop that carries the Galaxy Tab to play with it before purchasing.  It passed my tests and one came home to me shortly thereafter.  I have basically been very pleased with it. Like others have said, the battery life is a bit short, but I can get a full day out of playing with it before it needs to be charged so it's fine for me.  The wire that comes with it is ridiculously short (Samsung people take note, this really bites!!!), and it doesn't charge when plugged into the USB port on my laptop which I find bizarre.  Also, I don't think this is a Galaxy Tab problem, but an Adobe one, I can't play the flash games on Facebook on the Galaxy Tab.  I don't know of any tab that it works on though.\n\nWhat I like about it is: The size is perfect for tossing in my bag when I want to bring it with me.  It is pretty easy to use.  The Android market is getting better with each passing day and there are very few apps that I want but can't get yet.  The screen is crisp, clear, and the touch screen works well.  There are widgets that I can put up on the home page (and other ones) that are really helpful.  By far the best feature of this Tab is the micro SD slot.  The Galaxy itself only has 8GB on board which is really only about 6 with the OS and other apps loaded (some of which I wish I could delete but I can't)  With the SD slot, I can buy multiple cards and load my music, movies and TV shows without losing space on my Tab.  I have 3 cards now and have more on my wishlist.  This is a fabulous feature for someone who has a lot of media but who doesn't need it all on the Tab all the time.\n\nAll in all, I'm very happy with my purchase."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I was recently in the market for a small tablet and had to make a choice between the Galaxy Tab 2.0 7-inch and the new Google/Asus Nexus 7.  I chose the Galaxy for 2 main reasons:\n - Expandable memory\n - Rear-facing camera (with video)\n\nMy use for a tablet is primarily for checking e-mail and Web browsing throughout the house (much more portable and quicker to use than a laptop).\n\nFor me, having a camera is useful for those times when the tablet is closer/quicker than hunting down the digital camera, or for quickly taking a picture and posting it online.  There are also some apps that make use of the onboard camera, and having a rear-facing camera allows you to point the camera and see (on the screen) what it's looking at.\n\nThe expandible memory is a nice-to-have but hasn't been an issue so far.  If I start putting lots of music or videos on it, being able to add a 32GB memory card is going to be helpful.\n\nThe one big benefit that the Nexus has is that it comes with Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) out of the box.  I'm hopeful that my Galaxy Tab will eventually get 4.1 (it came with 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich), but it's no guarantee.  But even with 4.0, the interface looks great and is speedy and responsive.\n\nAs for the Galaxy Tab itself, it's been an outstanding device.  It comes with great apps, easily integrates with the Google Play store, and easily syncs up with both my Yahoo and Google accounts.  Web browsing is great, and the few games I've installed have worked perfectly.  A video chat I tried with Google Hangouts worked seamlessly.  I even recently tried the audio input (you talk, it types what you say) and was surprised at how well it worked.\n\nUnfortunately, it won't let you print to anything but a Samsung printer - so I have to go back to my main computer in order to print an e-mail or a map.\n\nOverall, a great tablet that I would recommend."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Caveat 1: This is my first \"Smart\" device. My phone makes phone calls, that is all. Caveat 2: This is my first exposure to Android.\n\nWhen I discovered that Samsung was making a mid-sized pad with WiFi and GPS, for under $250, I was delighted. This seemed to be able to fulfill so many of my desires, including two big needs-- A mid sized pad for use with Skeye, an amazing and completely unique astronomy app, and a highly configurable GPS that was big enough to use in the car yet could still fit in the pocket of my hiking shorts. (Note that a WiFi IPad cannot do GPS or Skeye, and besides it is too big and expensive.)\n\nThese two functions work great (for the most part--see below about screen) and alone make the device worth the price, but of course it does much more that is useful. I really liked that it could accommodate an external memory card to enhance the limited on-board memory, although this turned out to be mostly bogus, as apps cannot be put on the external SD card, due to terrible limitations in the Android operating system.\n\nFor the first week it worked perfectly. By the second week the software was extensively corrupted. By the third week I had to \"wipe\" the memory and start over. This was very disturbing. But as far as I can tell, this is the weakness of Android, not a hardware issue. Fortunately, as \"wiping\" appears to be routinely required on Android devices, it is well supported and implemented. Many of the weaknesses of this device (corruptibility, many very buggy apps, poor memory management, crippled external SD card) are due to Android and it's wild-west ecosystem, not Samsung.\n\nBut there are hardware issues too. The cameras are really poor, and no autofocus to boot. Makes many potentially useful applications useless.  The main camera is said to be 3.2 mp, but has the resolution of a 1 mp camera at best.  This is an area where Samsung really cut corners. My son has a fancy ASUS pad and the camera is 10x better, at least.  The Sammy can't read barcodes, or work as a document scanner or as a text translator, because it doesn't focus that close. Sharpness is terrible at any distance. The main camera is not a real camera, think of it as a web-cam for Skyping (backwards) or spying on your babysitter, that is all it is useful for.\n\nThe screen is good, but it lacks the brightness to easily use it as an in-car GPS in the daytime--too bad.  The position of the face-facing camera is not the best, at least when used in landscape mode--it is designed to be used in the portrait position only. In terms of processor speed and internet download speed, it is about where you would think for $250--good, but not up there with the big boys. Internet download speed is 3/4 of my sons high priced ASUS pad (I got 15 mbps, the ASUS was 20 on the same wifi and network), overall speed is about 40% but raw processor speed is ~25%. For me, this is fast enough, but probably some people will think otherwise.\n\nBattery life is good but not great--when semi-frequently used as a GPS during the day, with the screen at maximum brightness, it barely lasted the day. For most uses battery capacity is adequate, however. Sound is not bad for such a device, better than I had expected, but it can't really produce sounds under about 400 hz (no big surprise). WiFi reception is good, but not quite as good as higher end products I have tested--certainly adequate most of the time. GPS works very well indeed, every bit as good as the higher end products I have benchmarked it against. It lacks a gyro, and therefore the functionality that a gyro provides (whatever that might be!).\n\nThe wall charger that came with the Sammy appears to be a standard USB type, so I thought I could recharge the Sammy by plugging just the cord into the Belkin USB voltage charger I have in the car for use with my IPod, but it did not appear to work. I need to try again to verify this issue, but if this is a voltage mismatch issue, it is very inconvenient and a very odd decision by Samsung. Maybe the Belkin device doesn't produce enough current? Even with a strong magnifying glass, I cannot read the microscopic text describing the voltage/amperage output on the side of the Samsung charger!\n\nIf a much better device comes out for under $350, I would consider upgrading to get a real camera and brighter screen and a real external SD card slot. Right now, no such product exists on the market in this size/price.  On paper, there is no advantage with the Google Nexus 7, only downside. Maybe the hyped Apple Minipad, but I doubt it will meet my basic needs as described in the beginning of this review. So overall, I do like this device and will keep it (3 months return policy at COSTCO), but with a bit more refinement of hardware and software, this could be the Dream Device I have been anticipating for almost 20 years. It falls somewhat short of that at this stage, however.\n\nUpdate: The Samsung has been operating without any problems for a couple of more months now."}

This past week it began shutting off while in use, and it would not restart after a shutdown.  I can plug it into the charger for approximately 24 hours and it will then usually restart.  On this last incident it refuses to restart after several days on the charger.\n\nSince I still have my Amazon receipt, the box, and all materials I thought it would be no big deal; I'd just send it back to Samsung for repair.  No such luck, Samsung tells me that my serial number is not valid.  That's real funny, 'cause it's the same serial number I input when I registered the tablet on their site.  At that time the serial number was valid and they even provided the manufacture date of the device.\n\nI'm not at all pleased with having a $250.00 paperweight or with getting the shaft from Samsung.  I wasn't particularly upset with the problem with the device, things happen and electronic devices fail at times.  What I cannot tolerate is a company that ignores their customers.  I'm finished with Samsung products.\n\n-----\n\nIn the interest of honesty and full disclosure I must update my review.  Since my initial posting I was able to make contact with a Samsung customer service rep via online chat.  I was finally able to convince them that my tablet was dead, and get return authorization.  They emailed a UPS shipping label and my device went out this afternoon.  I will update this review after my (or a replacment device) is returned.\n\nI have upgraded my opinion of the device and Samsung by one star.  I still love the device, but I am troubled by the failure of it after only two months.  I've read numerous other reviews by users who state that they have the same problem.\n\nI'll update my review when I see how this situation plays out.\n\n--------------\n\nNow, nearly three weeks after I sent my device in to Samsung for repair, I find out that my device will not be repaired.  My device will be exchanged; apparently there would be a long delay waiting for parts to repair my device.  I've spoken with a few very nice ladies at Samsung this evening.  They're all pleasant, all very apologetic, and can't really give me a definitive answer on when I'll receive a replacement device.  The third young lady I spoke with this evening was very pleasant, very professional, and did seem interested in trying to find answers for me...unfortunately it seems that another department has to call me to discuss the exchange of my device.  When will they call me?  Nobody knows.\n\nI was told that it should take another 11-12 days for the process to be completed.  I'm just having a hard time understanding how, 3-4 days after you've determined that you cannot repair a customer's device and you're going to exchange it, how can it take nearly two more weeks to resolve this?  I could understand a situation like this if I had an older unit, out of warranty, and they were doing me a favor.  How can you drag out the repair or replacement of a new unit and call that customer service?  How can you drag a customer through so much bureaucracy and expect that they'll be a happy customer and want to continue to purchase your products?\n\nI suppose my review has turned into a review of Samsung's customer service instead of a review of the Galaxy Tab 2, though Samsung's performance directly affects my opinion of the Galaxy Tab 2.\n\nSamsung does not seem to be a customer oriented company, instead it gives the impression of a government bureaucracy where no one seems to have a definitive answer and the solution to your problem is always one call transfer away.  I LOVED the Galaxy Tab 2 while I had it, but the Samsung experience leaves much to be desired.\n\nEnjoy your Galaxy Tab folks and I wish you the best of luck.  I think I'm giving up on this adventure and going to another brand."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I admit, when it comes to tablets/phones I am 100% Apple.  While I'm not a fan of their computers, I really think they do a great job with the iPad and iPhone.  That being said, I have always been very curious about Android and \"the other side\".  I share my iPad with my wife, but apparently I hog it as she mentioned to me a few months back that she wanted one as well.  I took that as an opportunity, to her chagrin, to try out an Android tablet.  I looked around and found this Galaxy Tab.\n\nI have been pleasantly surprised with what this little gadget can do.  It takes a some getting used to, but it does everything the iPad does and a little bit more.  I like the widgets and the way you can customize each of your pages.  You really can't do that on an iPad - I always feel that Apple thinks they know better than their customer so why would you have to customize?\n\nThe screen is very clear and the size is nice too as my wife can just slip it into her purse.  Another drawback of the iPad.  It is fast as well, all the apps and programs I have tried are very quick and easy to use.  I also just upgraded it to 32GB for $19, that's at least a $100 perk for an iPad.  The infrared remote control is a cool option as well.\n\nA drawback I have found so far is that the WiFi is a little weak - I get a very strong signal sitting downstairs with my iPad but a very very weak signal with this Tab.  I've since moved my router which has helped considerably.  Another huge drawback is the obvious lack of apps.  There really is no comparison with Apple in this regard.\n\nOverall, I think this is a great product, I'm glad we bought it."}

This has expendable memory unfortunately it only works for files pics movies and music. Still better than nothing it frees some space. It has Google play and flash so you can watch videos. Nexus 7 doesn't have flash or expendable memory. This also has the 2 cameras i think, i honestly haven't used them yet. Also you can use it as an e-reader. It literally replaced my nook color. I am already happy with my buy. Although lastnight there was a sale on it for $220 then today it's back too $250 so I would watch out for a price drop. One other little gripe I have is that there isn't a mini usb port. That would have been nice. so I could buy a cheaper mini key board. But it does have Bluetooth so that's a plus. Oh and the screen smears easy but that's what screen protectors are for.\n\nSo on it the plus side it's easy to navigate the touch screen is responsive, graphics are great, comes with Google play and flash. Both Barnes and Nobel and kindle work, 2 cameras, expendable memory slot, light weight, nice screen and an affordable price.\n\nI tried 2 off brands and they both didn't come close to this tablet. Those were the 7\" visual image or something like that and the 10\" Archos 101 internet tablet. Also I own the nook color. Wish I had known about this then."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Overview:\n\nI am very happy with the Tab and use it daily for many things.  The highest praise I can give is that my wife is jealous of it.  But you have to go into it with reasonable expectations - if you compare it to an iPad you are likely to be disappointed.  I had no previous experience with an iPad, other than testing it an an Apple store, or any smartphone, so the capabilities were a revelation to me.  I chose it primarily because of the price and size - the iPad seemed too big and heavy for use as a book and magazine reader, and I did not want a phone with a monthly payment.  The Tab is comfortable to use standing on the Metro, on airplanes or lying down on the couch.  Others have complained that it is laggy, but I don't find this a big problem.  Like others I have found that it can be difficult to press the right button, especially in apps where the buttons are closely spaced, but somehow over time this has ceased to be an issue for me.  Typing with two thumbs is easy and responsive, especially in portrait mode.  Caveat: the market for small tablets is changing rapidly, with Google's Nexus, new flavors of Kindle Fire, and a rumored mini-iPad in the offing, so the competitiveness of this device is up in the air - it will have to evolve to stay viable.\n\nSpecifics:\n\n1. Reading books:  I chose this over the Kindle Fire and BN Nook because I did not want to be tied to one vendor and wanted a more open Android experience.  I do not regret this.  I also considered some e-ink readers, but have not found any problems with eyestrain reading the LCD screen and can read in sunlight to a degree if I crank up the brightness.\n\n2. Reading magazines and pdfs: I chose the Tab over an e-ink reader in part because I wanted to read media other than books.  This works well despite the small screen size.  While not optimal for 8.5x11 or A4 size pages, expanding 2-fold by tapping or pinch-and-zoom is available in most magazine and pdf apps and is good enough.  I mainly use Zinio for magazines and repli-go pdf reader for pdfs, which in addition make it easy to jump around in long documents.\n\n3. Camera: Specs are not impressive, but I have found it quite useful for close-up photos like portrait shots.  The convenience of having it on a device I often carry with me anyway and direct upload to Dropbox or Picasa make it preferable to a stand-alone camera.\n\n4. Web browsing and email:  A great convenience to have on-the-go or when you want to look up something in a book.  For serious usage, I still prefer my laptop.\n\n5. Calendar: Sync with my Google calendar is very handy.  Again, for serious usage, a laptop is better.\n\n6. Storage: I don't store movies or much music so even the 8 GB on board (4.59 GB usable) is adequate, but I bought a 32 GB micro SD card for extra space (and a bargain at $20 plus shipping).  Most apps can't use it, so it is not a complete solution, but it is a convenient place to stash photos and documents that are not tied to a dedicated app.\n\n7. Battery life: As advertised if you limit Wi-fi use, Bluetooth, and GPS to when you need them.  It also helps to keep the screen brightness down as this is the main power hog."}

I was initially looking at the other 7\" tablets, but they did not have the features that the Tab 2 7\" has.\n\nPros:\n7\" is perfect for watching video, email, web browsing, e-reading and general consumption\nBattery life is excellent - was able to watch two 2-hour movies streaming from Netflix and still had ~40% battery life left.  With light to moderate use, can go 1+ days without charging.\nHas a GPS receiver built in (so it can be used as GPS, but still needs WiFi or hotspot to download maps).\nMicro SD up to 32gb HUGE plus\nFront and rear cameras\nCPU speed is good\nIR Blaster and the Peel App - I LOVE this...  It's completely changed how I watch TV and find shows!!  It controls my Cable box, Stereo and TV (plus can add DVD/BR player as well).\n\nCons:\nLock button is easy to press when using w/o a case or stand\nCamera resolution is too low to replace a real camera\nWill not charge over USB from PC (neither will the iPad), and it's tough to find an A/C block that will charge it\n\nOther Notes:\nI'm still not sure about the Samsung apps.  I may end up rooting it and going with another version of 4.x, but I haven't researched the pros and cons of this yet on the Samsung Tabs..  I'm wondering is there is any functionality loss (like the IR blaster, etc.).\n\nIf you are looking for an alternative to the iPad or something more functional than the other 7\" tablets out there, I recommend this one.  While it's not perfect, it's \"bang for the buck\" factor is HIGH!!!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I received my Galaxy 2 7\" tablet right before Memorial Day. I liked the device itself when I purchased it. It had a micro SD slot and had received pretty good reviews. The price was great as well. The device worked as expected for the first 36 days after purchase. It then started having issues. It started with random reboots. I was not worried as first as I throw a lot at my tablets. A few weeks later the screen would no longer come on. I tried all the tips and the device would not respond at all. I plugged it in and unplugged it and held the power key for about 60 seconds. The device would boot but as soon as the screen would turn off it would die again.\n\nI called Samsung and was told I needed to ship it back. They asked for a detailed description and I provided it and they sent a UPS label for me to ship the device back. About 2 weeks later I got an email that my device was fixed. The explanation of the problem was simply \"Dead (Intermittent)\" and the repair was \"S/W Upgrade (External Factor)\". A few days later my tablet arrived and I was shocked to see it was just stuck into a bigger box with no additional packing. When I removed the device there was an obvious scratch and it looked like the back had been pried off as there were small gouges. I fire the device up and the first time the screen went off, same exact issue! I plugged it in, waited a few minutes, unplugged and held the power button for 60 seconds and it came back on.\n\nI again called Samsung and was told I needed to ship it back a second time. I asked why as it did not seem like they did anything except wipe it and re install the software. I told them this was unacceptable that I had to give up my tablet yet again since no one fixed it the first time. I also questioned the cosmetic damage and was told \"we are very careful with all customer devices\". I said so what if it comes back and is still not fixed? I was told they may consider an exchange. WOW, thanks.\n\nIf you get a good device you will probably be happy with it. If you have issues, good luck actually getting it fixed. I'm very disappointed in Samsung and the way they are handling this. At least offer me a replacement since they apparently can't fix mine. Not happy it was damaged either.\n\nUPDATE: I sent an email to the president of Samsung North America and got a call from someone in his office. She reviewed my case and said she would ship me a new Galaxy 2 7\" tablet as soon as my old one arrived at repair. She assured me this would be a new, sealed device. Today she notified me that it shipped from CA today. I'm very happy that they went the extra mile for me. I will report back once I receive the replacement and ensure it is working properly. Nice job Samsung!\n\nUPDATE: I have been using the new replacement unit for about a month now. No issues with the new unit so far. As I recall, unit one went dead at 36 days so let's see if this one will works in a week."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I currently own a 1st gen IPAD (64gb WIFI & 3G nonactivated and purchased on sale through AT&T when IPAD 2 came out) and only use it during traveling.  It's function for me falls between an expensive toy, e-reader, and movie player.  I wanted to Skype and a lighter tablet so I hesitantly purchased the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.0 7 inch at Costco for $239.  I cannot say how this tablet compares to newer generations of IPAD but compared with my 1st gen, it offers more versatility and of course it is the compact solution for traveling and doesn't add as much weight as the IPAD.  So now I can carry it in my purse everywhere I go with no bulk added!  Now I have Kindle keyboard so as far as reading goes, I prefer using the tablet for reading PDF files and have yet to try comic books which Kindle keyboard is not compatible with.  However, for regular e-books I still prefer my Kindle keyboard because of the battery life and the E ink technology that is much easier on my eyes.  The Samsung's touchscreen is slightly less responsive than the IPAD but after using it for a few days I've figured out that you can tweek the responsiveness on the settings.  As far as application use, you can open and manage multiple apps and widgets simultaneously which at first being a nuisance to an apple groupie like me,  I am slowing adapting to use the tablet for efficient tasking.  For instance, I usually need to scan tons of receipts so I downloaded a scan app like Genius scan then scan my documents and save to evernote.  I can open the calculator without closing the evernote app and calculate different receipts.  This is a huge time saver over the IPAD and Iphone which only allows one app to be opened at one time. My favorite widget so far is the sticky notes which can be posted in different sizes on the home screen (something IPAD can't do). However, to prevent the multiple apps from slowing down the Galaxy, it's important to check the task manager and close apps that are running in the background. As for internet connection, I haven't had any problems like other reviewers have posted.  Also, the microSD slot is a huge bonus over the IPAD which allows for expanded memory for photos and music, etc.  A 32 GB micrsoSD card on Amazon is around $19 so a huge money saver over any of the IPADs.  I am planning to purchase the Samsung accessory kit for USB and SD slot for greater expansion in the future (that's around $20 on amazon).  A couple things I didn't like are the poor camera resolution and the smudging and glare of the screen.  The IR remote app is a great concept that worked on my TV but has very limited functions. It doesn't allow for searching by channels and doesn't provide a tv guide.  When I entered into the menu of the tv, the keypad doesn't work for scrolling or exiting the menu.  Overall, I am making great use of the expanded capabilities. There is so much customization that I have spent hours exploring.\n\nUpdate Sept. 2\n\nI had buyer's remorse a few days after my samsung purchase but after I sold my IPAD, my relationship with my Samsung has blossomed. I've downloaded the DoubleTwist sync app for $4.99 and have synced all my media from Itunes onto my tablet as well as my PS3.  The bluetooth is a bonus as I've also synced a Kivia bluetooth speaAer.  I then transferred all my media to the 32GB microSD card that I also purchased on Amazon for $19.  People asked me where I purchased my case.  I couldn't find it on amazon so I purchased off of ebay, search for \"smart flip case cover samsung tab 7.0\".  The case looks like the colored flip cases that are sold from Apple for the Ipad. I loved this tab so much that I also purchased the white student edition bundle yesterday for $249, $10 more than I paid for the silver tablet alone a few weeks ago.  The bundle comes with a keyboard and usb adapter."}

I suppose I could do all this with a smart phone but really the screen is so small and inconvenient. I could carry a notebook but that is such a drag!\nSo I bought this 7 inch tablet and it suits me just fine, especially as the price ($250) is so reasonable. I can download Google maps for offline use and there are numerous travel apps such as an excellent guide to the Paris Metro. For E-books I persist with my Kindle because of the link with Amazon and the excellent quality of the print.\nI am quite computer literate and have been surprised that at home I often prefer this tablet to my notebook and PC.

I did download the Manual in PDF format from their Site; putting the Shortcut on my PC's Desktop. The Manual was a help mate in the initial days of learning about the functionality of the Tablet.\n\nI have come to utilize five Home Screens; using one just for utilizing the syncing of calendar, memos and contacts from my PC Outlook Program; one for financial programs and charts; and one for programs collecting news. Widgets come in handy for showing graphical charts and pictures associated with various Apps. The interface makes it so easy to customize the placement of apps and widgets on the Home Screens. Sometimes the interface is sensitive when one touches a widget or app icon. One has to tap quickly to execute the app or widget; otherwise the System thinks that you want to rearrange the icon on the Home Screen. I have around 67 apps plus numerous widgets on the system; and yet, I am only utilizing 669MB of the total 4.59GB available for personal usage. And I am not even mentioning the additional 32GB I have from my SD Card.\n\nSome of the Apps that I have downloaded are the Thumbs Plus Keyboard, the PowerAmp App (which really turns the already great tiny speakers into a full blown mono/stereo system (G)), Wifi Analyzer, eWeather HD, Dolphin HD Browser, An Money Plus Finance (in importing/exporting \".qif\" files from my desktop Quicken Program), ASTRO File Manager/Browser Pro, Deja Office Outlook Sync (which includes a desktop program to sync Outlook data to the Tablet - Great App, by the way!), News Republic for Tablet, KJV Bible, MyCar Locator and Tunein Radio Pro (my favorite).

I couldn't be happier with the choice.\n\nI bought my husband a kindle touch last year, and I loved the idea of having a collection of books at my fingertips. But being a geek I wanted something that did a bit more. I have always hated being tied to my desktop for things like checking email, reading the news or just general browsing. I also disliked having to run to my pc every time I wanted to look something up. Having the tablet eliminates those things for me. Also I wanted more room than what my smart phone gave me for games and apps such as the XBMC and roku remote apps.\n\nI can easily connect my tablet to my phones hotspot without any issue.\n\nI was able to set my tablet up as a phone using google voice & the GrooVe IP app (if you install this app make sure it's the one from Google play it's updated more frequently).

I loaded my text book which I usually carry in a notebook computer. downloaded my ebooks. very handy when I need to record my expense right away. great size for handheld game device. I screen shot recipes for going to supermarkets.....ok I am not going to write an essay. The only one star deduction is for the advertised 8GB memory. I've got only 4.59GB don't see why. Other than that, I just love this device.\n\nEdit:\n  This Tab 2 7.0 P3113 does not video output to TV (wasted my money buying the multimedia dock and HDMI cable). Samsung should clearified this on the product. What a disappointment. I have to change it from 4 stars to 3. Will pay extra attention to the capabilities or ask lots of questions of Samsung products from now on or won't buy it all.  We'll know."}

It was worth paying the extra $50. for the additional features which makes it a step above the Kindle Fire. Love Love Love. Having both a front facing and rear camera makes it eay for both picture taking and Skpye conversations. The size is just right as it can fit into any bag and its light weight feature makes it great for travelling. Battery power is exceptional and you can not only read but watch movies etc. It's the better buy for anyone who is looking for an eReader but would also like the added features of Web access. It is also a great option over getting a bulky laptop which not only cost more but is also much heavier.\nGreat buy for travellers/busy moms/business owners."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "The Tab2 is an excellent value and you would be hard pressed to beat it's performance and features at any price point. It does fine with any tablet function. Movies are crisp and the big games play without hesitation. The 7 inch format is really nice (if I wanted something bigger I'd probably drag my laptop around).\n\nI guess the hottest things on the market are the Google Nexus and the Ipad, but neither of these have an sd Slot for endless memory. I don't want to be tied to cloud storage for media. It would be nice however if the Samsung had a bit more core storage. Eight Gig would be enough if half of it was not taken up by unremovable Samsung apps that I don't use (well I guess I could root it).\n\nPros:\nSolid design and workmanship.\nGood battery life / quick charge\nGood default keyboard / access to any GP android apps.\nSound using headphones is excellent.\n\nCons:\nYou can block the wifi antenna cutting bars if you hold it wrong\nThe Keis computer sync program is a  pig/ you don't need it on W7.\nYou can't put apps on the sdCard without rooting.\nDirect hdmi connect to tv is iffy. The special cable is missing in action and the old one won't work.\n\nI haven't been able to get AllShare to fully work but thats just a tinkering thing.\n\nIt's a great small tablet and of course Amazon had it at my door really fast."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I bought this tablet two months ago from Costco and recently returned it. I was not satisfied with the tablet and I wouldn't recommend it to you, either.\n\nAt first the tablet was amazing! The screen is very clear and fun to watch videos on in dark places. I was able to search the internet much faster than my iPhone and Skyping with friends was much easier on the tablet than my laptop. I thought it was a great buy because I do a lot of traveling and could use an electronic device that is lightweight and can handle light usage, such as surfing the net, checking email, Skype, etc.\n\nHowever, my biggest gripe (and the one that made me return the tablet) is how often it freezes and slows down. Even with only one application open, the tablet will eventually slow down until there is a 2 or 3 second delay between each letter I type and when it appears on the screen. If I was IMing a friend on GChat, the tablet would lag like this only ~10 minutes after the conversation began. The Internet froze ALL THE TIME.\n\nAlso, the glossy screen is a pain if you are trying to watch anything when there is ANY glare. The screen is so glossy that it works like a mirror, more so than the iPhone or iPad screen I believe. It is a pain trying to watch movies if there is any type of light. The touchscreen is not very sensitive as well, which made surfing the internet frustrating. If buttons are close together on the screen, forget about trying to click one properly. The tablet can't differentiate between buttons closer than about 1/2 a centimeter apart, so you'll have to zoom in. Even my iPhone 3 has a more sensitive touch screen, which I thought was a little ridiculous as the Samsung is much newer technology.\n\nThis may be a personal preference, but I don't believe the home screen is intuitive at all. There are 4 apps on the bottom that you can switch in and out, but I used way more than 4 apps on the tablet for the pure fact that it is a tablet - you can use it for a much wider range of applications than you can a phone (which also has 4 apps on the home screen). If you want to see all the apps you have to click/swipe through a couple more times to see the entire app inventory, and when you want to quit an app it isn't as easy as swiping the app out of the \"what apps are running right now\" pop up log. Even if you swipe it out, and you can't access it anymore, it still runs in the background for some reason. The fact that it was so difficult to properly quit an application bothered me a lot. I thought the tablet's software was very poorly designed because it took too many click-throughs to get to windows that you needed.\n\nAnother issue is many video-streaming sites are not supported by Android or make you pay for the mobile version, such as Hulu.\n\nI use both PCs and Macs. Don't get me wrong, Apple's iPad has its own issues (I actually returned an iPad 2 as well), but the one thing I hate about PCs is how difficult it makes everything. Something has to freeze, not run properly, shut down on you, or get a virus. The Samsung Galaxy is in the same vein."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Received the tablet two days ago, like it very much, it is very fast, works well. The only problem I have is switching the language from English to Russian. You cannot select two languages and use them simultaneously, you either type your message in Russian or in English. As far as I understand this is the Adnroid 4 problem - you cannot switch the language using the virtual keyboard, there is no special button (if I'm not mistaken there were few ways previously, including sliding on the space button etc), so everytime I have to go to preferences and switch it there; it is quite irritating.\n\nPS In few days I found the way to select few languages, it is quite deeply hidden in keyboard preferences, so now I have a special button on it to switch from English to Russian. But as far as I understand, many users  could face the same problem, so maybe there should be some clarification from the Android developers regarding this."}

I doubt I would have purchased it without the opportunity to try it out first. I also don't usually purchase items like this without reading some customer reviews and researching them a little. That being said; I am more than pleased with my purchase. I am going on my third week of owning it and have no complaints. Everything exceeds my expectations. The Tab 2 came preloaded with a wide variety of Apps and has the ability to download and install Apps for just about anything you could want to do on it. It comes with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) OS already installed. While I haven't explored all of its functions yet; the ones that I have work great. The memory can be upgraded to 32GB with a Micro SD card; I recommend SanDisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC Card Plus Adapter (SDSDQUA-032G-U46A). I bought mine from Amazon for $29.94 (USD). You can download and watch movies, stream movies from NetFlix, download books and apps from the Kindle store, retrieve and send e-mail, use the organizer app to keep track of appointments, etc. etc. Did I mention you can download an app for just about anything you want to do on this tablet? You can sync your music, video, pictures, and contacts from your computer using the Samsung Kies Software. A word to the wise, download and install the Samsung USB drivers BEFORE you install the Kies software and connect your Tab 2. If not you are going to have problems. I learned the hard way. The battery life is excellent. The WiFi connection is a breeze to setup. I bought the eWonder(R) Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Case for 7\" Samsung Galaxy Tab PLUS and the New Galaxy Tab 2 (Black) from Amazon for my tablet and it was also a breeze to setup and connect.

It does EVERYTHING any other tablet can do and at an affordable price!  We decided to purchase Samsung brand based on our great experiences with Samsung smart phones and other long-lasting products we've purchased.  There are more apps than we could possibly need! We chose to buy a wifi only tablet because we almost never use any data on our smart phones.  Why pay twice for internet?  We have wifi in the house as well as find it nearly everywhere we go.  The few times we'd need it, we still have our Samsung Galaxy smart phone to back us up!  So much fun for only $250, I can't believe people are paying $600 for an ipad!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I started with a Kindle Fire and was sorely disappointed by how much it lagged, so I exchanged it for the Samsung. I am a HUGE fan of Samsung and have always felt they produce a good quality product. The Galaxy worked great ... at first. The camera in it was good, the surfing was fast (with Chrome), my apps ran a lot smoother than they had on the Fire, the battery life wasn't stellar, but overall I was happy with my purchase. After 3 weeks, however, I went to plug it in and it wouldn't charge at all. Luckily, I was still within my 30 day return window with Amazon and I simply exchanged it. That process was quick, they sent me a new one which arrived in a couple of days (I didn't have to wait for them to get the defective one). I got the new one, got it all updated, apps redownloaded and had it up and running in no time. That same night, I finished using it, shut it off and plugged it in to charge. Next morning, I go to turn on the tablet and its been completely reset to factory defaults, I had to re-enter my information, redownload the apps, etc. Figured it was just a fluke, but sure enough, the next time I turned it back on after turning it off, it did the same thing again. I packed it back up and sent it back to Amazon within 2 days of getting it. This time I've just gotten a refund. I am sadly disappointed. For the \"value tabs\" I felt this was the best one available, especially with the option to add a memory card (the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire don't). Guess, I'm waiting a little longer to find a great tablet."}

This was probably the biggest concern that I had. Generally speaking, more advanced products tend to require a more advanced user. Since the Galaxy2 is functionally better than the Kindle fire, I was concerned the amount of functionality could actually make this less so for my less-than-tech-savvy-Mother. Obviously, I took the chance and made the purchase. So far she has hit the ground running, and is in love with this thing. The First gen Kindle she swore she was \"Not trying to replace\" is collecting dust. I recently received a text message from back home with my grandfather playing a card app, something he has been doing every night since he arrived.\n\n2) It's standout features? What makes this a better decision than the Fire? Much more noticeable than the power under the hood; Front/Back facing camera and expandable memory.\n\n  - Without Expandable memory, you get X number of gigs. Want to upgrade memory? Prepare to buy a brand new unit. With expandable memory, the 8 gig Galaxy 2 can be transformed into a 40  gig unit for less then 20 bucks.\n  - Front/back facing camera really is meant for skype capabilities. I live across the state, so it's nice to be able to speak face to face with my family.\n\nLong story short, great purchase."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Pros: built-in speakers, bright display, subjectively realistic color, excellent form factor for travel, came with android 4 ics, smooth video playback\n\nCons: un-removable bloatware, unable to move apps or data to external SD card, should come with 16gb internal storage, touchscreen sometimes slow to respond (adding a screen protector makes that worse), battery life with WifI on could be better, shortage of compatible accessories\n\n- - - - - - - -\n\nI wanted to replace my first-gen iPad with a 7\" tablet. My choice came down to this device and the Nexus 7. Samsung won for one simple reason: the micro SD slot. If you have any desire to carry video around to watch where you can't stream, you need storage space.\n\nThe Gtab is lighter than the iPad -- though hardly lightweight, especially when compared to a Nook Touch -- which makes a difference for extended reading of e-books, or reading while lying down. Being a smaller device, it's also easier to travel with; it doesn't take up as much room in a carry-on and it fits in a coat pocket (or even a cargo pocket in my shorts!). The micro SD card slot means I can carry more videos to watch on a plane, though the battery life for video isn't as long as I'd like. Battery life while streaming Netflix via WiFi is even less; it's good for 2 - 2.5 hours and then it's time to recharge.\n\nI don't understand complaints I've read about the screen and its resolution. The screen is bright (turn off the auto brightness adjustment and do it manually), colors look reasonably good, and playback is smooth. Any artifacts I've seen in videos come from the videos themselves, not the screen. It's a 7-inch tablet; how many more pixels do you need?\n\nSmall speakers don't sound particularly great, but these are at least good enough to let someone else listen with me on occasion. Sound through good headphones is quite good.\n\nThe Gtab is good for reading, too; the size makes it easier to handle than the iPad. I've had some issues with certain e-books, but they're from the e-book or the reader app, not from the tablet.\n\nI'm not happy about the lack of an adapter for video out so I could watch purchased movies/TV shows on my HDTV (although reading elsewhere indicates that you can't port DRMed material on any of the Tab devices to a TV through Samsung's HDMI adapter (which is not compatible with this device)). For that matter, not happy with the custom connector in the first place. A mini- or micro-USB connector would have made life easier all the way 'round. There also appears to be no docking station of any kind that's compatible with this particular device. (Seriously, Samsung? You have other tablets with the same type of connector, but you changed the pin-outs or something on THIS device so that it can't be used with any of the accessories that work with them?)\n\nI'm glad that the Gtab came with Android 4 installed, so I didn't need to wait for an upgrade (the Gtab recently upgraded itself to version 4.0.4). However, I'm not happy that there is so much bloatware preinstalled, and no way to remove it without rooting the tablet. I also dislike the fact that there is no way to move apps -- or data that they download/install -- to the external SD card without rooting the tablet. Some apps can't even see the external card (which, I realize, could be the fault of the app rather than the tablet).\n\nGiven that Samsung has locked down so many things to internal storage, it would have been nice to have a 16gb device available. I'd have paid an extra $50 for that. Instead, I'll get around to rooting the tablet one of these days so I can ditch stuff I don't use and move data (downloaded videos and books) to external storage. For now, though, the combination of price, usability, and form factor means that I'm fairly happy with the Gtab.\n\nNote: If you're switching to the Gtab from an iPad, and want to continue using iTunes for organize your music, get the iSyncr WiFi app. You may have to create special playlists -- iSyncr doesn't support picking & choosing songs/videos, it just grabs the whole playlist -- but this is the best iTunes tool available on Android right now."}

I considered the iPad, but don't use an Apple (except iPod) for anything else because of the nature of my work. I've used the iPad 2 and iPad 3 owned by a relative and found it overpriced for something that's more like a toy and isn't that practical. The iPad is also embarrassingly large (it's funny watching people with these large tablets in airports). I wanted something smaller and more practical that would be compatible with the work I do every day, and the Galaxy Tab definitely fits the bill. I'm not sure I'd find the iPad mini much better.\n\nThe only glitch I had was that I had to restart my router on the second day so that my wifi connection would remain stable. Haven't had any problems since. I like the fact that I can check e-mail from my own server, download, view and edit/create MS Office documents using free software, read Kindle and ePub content using free apps, organize music, books, photos, etc. into various folders on the external SD card and surf the Web easily with Chrome or the default browser. I rarely use my laptop or computer for simple tasks anymore, unless I have to use proprietary software for my work. This handy device will be great on flights. Say goodbye to paid carry-ons and hello to free personal items! :o)\n\nThe system updates to 4.04, which seems to work pretty well, but I preferred the keyboard on the 4.01 version. Some people recommend the Hacker's Keyboard, but if you use one like that, beware that some data (such as credit card numbers) can be transmitted to the keyboard designer. Of course, I don't plan to make any purchases using the Tab, but it's something to think about. I initially added the German keyboard to the default US keyboard (not Hacker's version), but found it a real pain because every time I tapped the spacebar it switched keyboards instead of adding a space, so I removed it. I also turned off the autocomplete feature because it is more of a pain than helpful. Google's voice recognition is a great feature in lieu of typing, but you have to have an online connection to use it.\n\nBattery life can be extended using airplane mode and keeping the brightness setting down. I don't care for the glossy screen, so I'm getting a non-glare screen protector. Streaming Netflix and YouTube works well. I'm looking forward to trying Skype and/or Google Voice on it. Before I bought it, I wasn't sure if I would use it much, but now that I have it, I don't think I'd want to part with it."}

I can hook up to netflix and stream movies and I can surf the web with ease. It is very easy to figure out, and the battery life is very nice. The camera is okay, I can take better pics with my phone. I am over all very pleased with this tablet!!!"}

This is my first tablet. Well  worth it. I found the size of the tablet to be convenient, and it makes it easier to hold for long periods of time. The tablet has all your basic apps installed. Very user friendly, easy to use and good battery life. I did end up returning my tablet because the internet browser keeps on closing by itself. As usual, AMAZON customer service people were very helpful and sent me a replacement."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I did a few weeks' worth of searching and comparing before I bought The Tab 2 7.0, and this tablet offers more bang for the buck than any other tablet in its size and price point.\n With the right apps, this tab really shines. I find the rear camera useful for bar code and QR scanning without issue using the free Barcode Scanner app (the one with a bar code icon with a red triangle in the center), and also use the Paper Camera, DSLR and Pixlr-o-matic apps which get the most out of the camera's abilities. While the rear cam is only a 3 megapixel, it's still useful. If I want to take better photos, I have dedicated cameras but this does quite well in a pinch, and will also shoot 720p video for those times when you're caught without a camera or camcorder. The front camera is useful for using Skype or other comm apps.\n\n The speakers sound remarkably well for being so tiny, but they are both at the end of the tablet while  holding it landscape mode. Not a problem. Still, for listening while watching movies or Wifi FM radio (TuneIn radio app), I'll use either my Sennheiser CX400 or Audeo Phonak ear buds. I installed PowerAmp and am impressed with the sound quality while listening to downloaded music and FM; separation and imaging  capabilities, even while plugged into my run of the mill Creative T20 speakers at work was startling. It was like having much better speakers!\n\n Video while watching streaming Netflix or converted mp4s is excellent and for a 7\" screen, I didn't find the resolution lacking and the colors were saturated but not unrealistic, using the built-in Netflix app, the native video player app or MX Player Pro. I did not notice any light bleed and the blacks were black, not dark gray. It was easy getting caught up in a 2-hour movie while watching it on this Tab.\n\n Wifi connection is instant, both at home and on public networks and have not dropped any connections, remaining strong even while straying 50-60 feet from my home router. I think most issues with wi-fi is having \"same channel\" interference from other routers in the neighborhood, so I installed the free app Wifi Analyzer (if it's not here, check the goggle Play store), which will let you know what channels the other routers are using as well as signal strength, so you can plan accordingly which channel to use with your own router.\n\n GPS works fine; I was able to get 8-meter accuracy while using Goggle Maps. Goggle Sky is also fun to use. I also use GPS Test Plus from the Play store. eWeather HD by Elecont is an awesome weather app, also with HD radar and even earthquake features, and uses either GPS or you can punch in a ZIP code.\n\n I installed a SanDisk 32GB MicroSDHC card, and as for transferring data to or from the laptop, you can use either the supplied USB cable that comes with the charger, but I prefer using WiFi File Explorer Pro (also at the Play store) which provides an easy Web interface from a desktop or laptop, but it's only secure when using it at home (provided you're using an encrypted wireless connection, right?) which makes for easy transfers and avoids the hassle of having to use the restrictive length of a USB cable; ES File Explorer also works fine.\n\n As for moving apps to the external SD, it's not happening (yet) which can be an issue, since the ShadowGun game app alone is over 450mb once the data is downloaded for the game (and by the way, ShadowGun plays fine on the dual core TI OMAP processors on the Tab 2). There are also astronomical apps which can go from 500mb - 1GB with the downloaded data (SkySafari Plus and SkySafari Pro) so there is somewhat cause for alarm, as out of the 8GB of memory this tablet has, there's only around 4GB free when it comes new out of the box. I've checked the forums, and there is much concern regarding not being able to move apps from internal memory to the external SD (MicroSDHC) card. Some think it's a Samsung issue, while other think it's because Goggle (the developers of Android) wants people to use the cloud for storage needs. With Android releases through version 3 it wasn't an issue saving apps to the external memory card, but beginning with version 4 (Ice Cream Sandwich) the code changed as far as permissions went, so I'll quote Moderator Blast (thanks!) from the Galaxy Tab forum:\n\n\"Turns out Google had for some reason since Honeycomb 3.2 decided to split the write permissions for the internal memory (the path of which is confusingly named /mnt/sdcard) and external SD card memory (the path being /mnt/sdcard/extStorages/SdCard) into WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE respectively.\n\nApps to SD\n\nThe SD card is mounted r/w, but the owning group is media_rw which is linked to the WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE permission.\nUnfortunately, this permission was not required for access to the external sdcard prior to 3.2 so most file management utilities do not request it when they run...\nmeaning they only have read access to the card.\n Before Honeycomb 3.2, apps only had to request for the permission WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and they would have write access to both the internal and external so-called \"sdcard\" sets of memory.\nNow, apps have to request for WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE if they want to write to the external SD card, but many of them have not yet been updated to do so yet. This affects file managers / explorer / compression utility type apps most often because users would tend to use them to copy / move / zip files within the file system.\n As for Ice Cream Sandwich, latest reports are that, yes, they are going to continue with this separate permission model.\nHopefully in the future, more apps would have been amended to include the necessary permission/security settings.\"\n\n So as you can see, most developers are just not aware of this change while writing apps for the current versions of Android, but hopefully they will catch on soon. For now, the only way to circumvent some of the bloat is to root the tablet, but I see some users experiencing issues after doing this, and rooting the tab will void the warranty (not to mention the possibility of \"bricking\" it, or rendering it useless), and since Samsung hasn't made their stock firmware available as a back up solution, rooting for me is out of the question.\n\n The Tab 2 makes a fine e-book reader. The included Kindle app works well, and the text is very sharp, clean and easy to read - to the point where I've already read 5 books since having the tablet in less than a month. It's just a pleasure to read with. You can also turn off GPS, Wifi, Sync and screen rotation to save on the battery. The new 4.04 release for Ice Cream Sandwich released by Samsung this past week in an update also adds some power saving features and a few other enhancements (it shipped with 4.03 in June when I received it).\n\n As for Web browsing, I use Dolphin HD which is fast, allows me to keep multiple tabs open while not slowing down the browsing, and allows me to browse Websites in native Desktop mode (with the Dolphin Desktop add-on); otherwise some sites will sense that you're using a mobile device and causes frustration while having to view in a different style than what you're normally used to. But browsing the Web is fast and enjoyable; pinch-to-zoom is quick and effortless with no lag. YouTube also works and plays fine.\n\n Typing on a device this size can cause frustration or outright expletives (I've experienced both), and after much research for alternate keyboard apps, I downloaded the Thumbs Plus keyboard app (the Play store) and never looked back. It costs a few dollars, but rest assured it's very much worth it. It's a real joy to use, and a no-brainer with any Android tablet.\n\nOh, and grab a matte finish (non-glare) screen protector; you'll find them if you look and it's really worth the time finding one, as it turns the screen from it's default mirror finish into a screen that's a pleasure to work with and doesn't affect brightness or clarity. I like it so much that when I ordered the Tab I also ordered the Skinomi screen protector, which has a gloss finish. The Skinomi is still sitting in the box unused.\n\nIf I can think of anything else to add, I'll update this review. Until then, I'm very happy with my purchase of the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.\n\nEDIT 7/25/2012 - I've read some reviews where the length of the charging cable is short (and it is). What I've done is attach a ten foot USB extension cable between the end of Samsung's charging cable and the USB port on the actual AC charger and it works fine for charging (although I haven't tried copying or moving data)&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/AmazonBasics-USB-2-0-A-Male-to-A-Female-Extension-Cable-9-8-Feet-3-0-Meters/dp/B001TH7GUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">AmazonBasics USB 2.0 A-Male to A-Female Extension Cable (9.8 Feet/3.0 Meters)</a>.

There is no way to copy or move media to the SD card without being connected to a computer.  With a 8GB HD there is little room to store  anything other than Apps. Very disappointing!  Furthermore Kies is not compatible with this product. Otherwise, it could be great."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Aside from all the positives about this device already mentioned, I'm disappointed after owning it since it came out that the following apps that I use on my phone and my previous Tab 10.1 tablet worked but don't work on this tablet: CNN, CVS, and USA Today -- there are others, but these three I use the most often. I had and returned the tab 10.1 because I found that I really needed the extra storage, and that Tab didn't have an sdcard slot, but those apps did work on the 10.1. This tab has the sdcard storage, but the apps I use the most aren't compatible. Yes, you can root and try to change the device name and other tricks to get the Google Playstore to install those \"incompatible\" apps, but I don't want to take that route. I really don't know why those apps don't work on this tab. I got the amazon app store on the device and kinda rigged getting USA today on this tab by choosing the phone version (and it works fine.) The Google Playstore won't let you install the Phone or Tablet version. If I could do it again, I would've waited for the Tab 2 10.2 w/sdcard or the upcoming Windows Surface Tablet. With that being said, check out the Google Playstore for the apps you'll use first before you buy this to see if they are compatible."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "When the Tab 2 7.0 came out it looked wonderful. Feature packed with Android 4, cameras, SD card slot (important but missing on many tablets), GPS, Google Maps, etc. and the tablet itself has lived up to its promise but Samsung unfortunately has not. I have become well acquanted with their customer service and the people are great but seem to have spotty training. It is like the \"little girl with the curl\".\n\nWhen it became evident that their Bluetooth instance had trouble pairing with a number of common devices (on access would give constant pairing requests), at first they denied the problem & said it was the adapter, then they were working on it. Finally two months after it was reported, ICS 4.0.4 came out and it was fixed.\n\nExcept no-one told the service desk just as no-one told them that Allshare had been moved from a seperate app to part of settings. This is bad because from day one HDMI support had been promised except it needed an unobtainable adapter. Then it was said one of their adapters would work except it doesn't. Samsung's latest move is to redact the reference to HDMI from their specifications and user guide (is in revs up to 3, not in rev 7. Page 22). Lawyers have a word for this.\n\nSo if it does what you need out of the box or with an available adapter then you are fine but if something you expected to work (like the Sat-Nav seems to need WiFi/3G access to calculate driving directions but the GPS itself seems powerful) is \"different\" or is in the specs but does not seem to be there (like being able to connect to an external display), good luck.\n\nIn any case, be kind to the service desk people, they are trying to do the right thing."}

The speed is good as long as you do not sart to run multiple apps. The camera is a bit lower quality compared to other tabs but still pretty ok. Now my biggest complaint about this Tab would have to be its responsiveness of from a touch from a sylus or finger. I am not to sure whether Samsung went a cheaper on the screen or screen sensor however that is the what really brings down my opinion of this Tab. Everything else about the Tab is compromisable especially for the great price that you can purchase one for however the lack of response from a touch of either a stylus or finger is enough to make me not want to use it at time."}

This device is always at my side."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "It was my birthday and my family asked me what I wanted.  I decided a new toy would be nice.\n\nMy needs are minimal as I'm at my desktop much of each day, but occasionally like to read from my Kindle, surf for deals on Amazon, watch a Netflix movie, listen to music and email.  I have accomplished these things with my Android phone, but slowly using 3G and a 4\" screen.\n\nFor a tablet I wanted a 7\" screen, camera w/ video capabilities, responsive operating system, expansion capabilities with a microSD card, and a built in GPS, not dependent upon wifi or 3G.  I found all of that in the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.  Not the fastest OS (Google Nexus 7 will have the 4.1 Jellybean) or the fastest processor or the very best screen resolution, but 'very good' which translated into a good compromise between features and price for me. Not an iPad... but not meant to be one either.\n\nWhat I like about the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2...\n1. GPS navigation worked well and was fast to locate satellites, making it a good choice for the person who likes having a GPS, but rarely uses one except to locate somewhere to eat lunch in the city. (Like me!)\n2. Has more features than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kindle-Fire-Full-Color-7-Multi-touch-Display-Wi-Fi/dp/B0051VVOB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi</a>&nbsp;- which I also own - and with the free Kindle app still allows me to take my books with me.  The viewing experience is the same as both have similar screens in clarity and size.\n3. The 3.0MP rear facing camera takes good pictures and video.  Not the best I've seen, but certainly as good or better than my&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/LG-Optimus-Prepaid-Android-Phone-Virgin-Mobile/dp/B004LJ8N78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">LG Optimus Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile)</a>.\n4. The weight is substantial - you know you're holding it - and the build quality is excellent! Buttons (rockers) feel solid and are easy to find.\n5. Touchscreen swipes are smooth and transitions move quickly.\n6. Wi-fi is easily found and connected.\n7. Screen is bright and clear.  Adjustments to brightness easily made in 'Settings'.\n8. Watching Netflix and Amazon On Demand movies was lag-free and enjoyable. I was a worried about it not being as clear as I would like, but due to the 7\" screen size, there was no problem at all.  I've seen the iPad display and while it's not that tight, it's very good.\n9. Good battery life.  If you put it on 'Airplane mode' in settings, you'll get even more life out of your juice!\n10. Came with lots of apps installed: Netflix, Gmail, Google, and more, as well as useful widgets for weather and calendar.\n11. Charging went quickly and easily with the adapter that allows for USB or AC charging.\n12. Web browsing was quick n' easy, as was emailing with this tablet.\n13. This tablet has Bluetooth!  I have a bluetooth headset that I pair with it:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/LG-Tone-HBS-700-Wireless-Bluetooth-Stereo-Headset-Retail-Packaging-Black-Orange/dp/B0052YFYFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">LG Tone - HBS-700 Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange</a>&nbsp;which also works with my LG Optimus phone.  I can use it to do Google Talk calls - long distance for free via Gmail's interface.  The tablet has a built in microphone on the front and you can use regular headphones for Google Talk, or you can use the one on your Bluetooth.\n\nWhat I wish was a bit better...\n1. I would love it if Samsung was to offer an OS update to 4.1 Jellybean to make this thing fly!  4.0 Android Ice Cream OS is quick and when I received this tablet I immediately went to 'About' and clicked 'Update' - receiving the 4.04 update for Ice Cream.  The update requires a reboot of your system and you may lose data, so good to do it right out of the box.  Made a nice improvement in the tablet's speed after the update!\n2. Again, the Nexus 7 will have a faster processor, faster OS and better display 1280x800 pixels, but the 1.2 forward facing camera n' no expansion slot were big issues for me.  The Samsung doesn't have those 'fast' components and yes, I wish it did, but then I remember the price point.\n3. Not much documentation came with it.  Undoubtedly it's either on the device or online, but sometimes you just want to read a good book or have it handy for reference.\n4. Internal memory gets eaten up quickly by apps, but multitasking isn't this tablet's strong suit - or my expectation.\n5. No HDMI or USB ports, but it does have Bluetooth and can act as a remote control with included app via infrared.\n6. GPS - yes, I put it in the 'like' area too, but truthfully it's more of a slow toy on this tablet than a GPS replacement.\n\nI am pleased with 2 accessories I bought for this tablet:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MoKo-TM-360-Degree-Rotating-Detachable-Cover-Case-for-Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-2-7-0-7-inch-Tablet-Black-with-Vertical-and-Horizontal-Multi-angle-Stand/dp/B0083OZ050/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MoKo(TM) 360 Degree Rotating Detachable Cover Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 7-inch Tablet, Black (with Vertical and Horizontal Multi-angle Stand)</a>&nbsp;which fits this tablet perfectly - allowing for access to all the ports and protecting it while also allowing horizontal or vertical viewing, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ultimate-Clear-Ringbo-Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-2-7-0-New-Release-Tablet-7-Screen-Protector-Cover-Film-with-Warranty/dp/B007VGI9OK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">[Ultimate Clear] Ringbo Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 New Release Tablet 7\" Screen Protector Cover Film with Warranty</a>&nbsp;which while tricky to apply, also fits perfectly.\n\nI also bought a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SanDisk-32GB-microSDHC-Memory-Card-Bulk-Package/dp/B003WGJYCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SanDisk 32GB microSDHC Memory Card (Bulk Package)</a>&nbsp;for it, which inserted easily and was recognized as 28GB of useable space by the tablet.  *FYI... it's not uncommon for any storage to be recognized as less than the stated size after installation.\n\nCharging the device out of the box and then updating it immediately made using it the best it could be upon first use.  I will be installing an app to do basic clean-up of the memory cache and an antivirus.  There are several free options for both.\n\nBeing my first tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 doesn't have big shoes to fill in my life like if I was an iPad user.  I don't think anyone with an iPad would find this tablet interesting at all!\n\nFor those who want portability, with more functionality than the Kindle Fire and a tablet with good speed and expansion, as well as a camera and video taking capabilities - this is a very good choice at an affordable price.\n\nRE: Apps\n\nIf you want to install the Amazon Appstore on your Samsung Galaxy Tab 2... you have to go to www.amazon.com/appstoreapp and download the app.  Your tablet may say 'no' and block it.  If so, go into 'Settings', 'Security' and under 'Device Administration' make sure the box for 'Unknown Sources' is check marked.  The tablet will caution you that this makes your private info vulnerable, but in reality all it does is open up other another Appstore (other than Samsung's which is installed on the device) for you.\n\nOnce you do this you should be able to download and install the Amazon Appstore and use it.  That works well for me as I have several apps already that I use on my Android phone and Kindle Fire, which can also be used on this tablet.\n\nI'd suggest adding some of these apps I found useful and/or fun picked up at the Amazon Appstore.  Most, if not all, are free.\n\nRemember that every day Amazon offers a new app for free. They are paid apps that for 1 day only, Amazon offers for free download.  Sometimes, they are apps valued at $10 the day before, so it's definitely worth checking frequently!\n\nHere's a not so short list of 25 of my favorite apps for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2:\n\n1. Temple Run - fun game at the top of the iTunes app charts.\n2. App 2 SD Pro - to make sure you get the most out of your microSD space.\n3. Angry Birds Free - nice time waster!\n4. Fruit Ninja Free - another fun time waster.\n5. TextPlus Free Texting + Group Text - get a free texting phone number and text via wifi.\n6. AVG Free - antivirus for your tablet.\n7. MyFitnessPal - diet and exercise tracker.\n8. Cozi Family Organizer - works really well and your whole family can use it.\n9. E!Online - fun to keep up with entertainment news.\n10. EasyPrint - print from your tablet to wifi enabled printers.\n11. EasySudoku\n12. ESPN ScoreCenter\n13. Gemini App Manager - easy, fast way to make sure apps are not soaking up memory.\n14. HootSuite - love it for Tweets.\n15. Old Time Radio Player - just fun to listen to the Lone Ranger!\n16. OfficeSuite\n17. Official Ebay Android App\n18. PicShop - edit photos.\n19. Scanner Radio - listen to EMT and Police scanner traffic.\n20. SwiftKey 3 - makes texting and typing much faster with intuitive type by swype.\n21. TuneIn Radio - what it says...\n22. Star Chart -check out constellations.\n23. iHeartRadio - like Pandora (also available), create custom radio stations.\n24. Antivirus Free or Avast! - keep safe while surfing.\n25. NBC Nightly News - in case you missed it!\n\nUPDATE: 8/29/12\nStill really enjoying this tablet, and finding more reasons to recommend it every day.  For the speediness of it, size and features, it's really a great buy!\n\nUPDATE: 12/2/12\nDisappointing... the Galaxy is dead.  Started not holding a charge, then wouldn't turn on, and finally wouldn't charge at all.  My use with this tablet has been about once a week for about an hour.  Not exactly hard on it, so I'm a bit bummed.  I did run an update prior to this happening so I'm not sure if it's a bad update or the hardware.  Either way, dead in the water and will be contacting Samsung for warranty repair or replacement.\n\nUPDATE: 4/21/13\nThe 'end' to my Tab story is that I took it back to Costco (where it was purchased as a gift with a 2 year warranty) and they told me they'd replace it, but had none in stock and to come back a week later.  I did that (after a call confirmed they had them in stock) and drove 30 miles only to find they were out of stock.  I asked how long it would take to repair it, and that was 'unknown' via the Costco repair system.  I asked for, and received a refund on the purchase price (went back on the person's credit card who purchased the gift...).\n\nI liked the Tab, but since have purchased a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Apple-iPad-MC705LL-A-16GB-Wi-Fi-Black-3rd-Generation/dp/B00746LVOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Apple iPad MC705LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, Black) 3rd Generation</a>&nbsp;which I love.  I purchased directly through Apple refurbs, and it came with a 1 year warranty - for under $400.  Yes, it's more expensive, but it's also better.\n\nIf you're looking for a budget Android tablet, this is still a good choice though, and if Costco had them in stock when I had returned to exchange, I'd probably still have it."}

I haven't had a chance to play with the nexus7 yet but from specs and reviews it seems like the galaxy tab 2 is the all over winner. this is a great device and worth your money."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "For me, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 hits the sweet spot in devices. It gets high marks for price, performance, value, design and portability. While I don't use it for work, I do use it to watch netflix, read Kindle books, read epub books, shop on Amazon, search the web, type emails, video chat, google chat, control my tv, satellite receiver, samsung dvd player. In fact, I enjoy using it so much, I'm seriously considering dropping my mobile data plan on my smartphone and opting for voice and messaging only.\n\nMy only complaint is not about the device, but rather about the eco system for non-ipad tablets. I pre ordered mine so I got the first case I could find. It's a great folio but it lacks a hole for the rear camera. Same thing with apps. There is one app on the iOS system that I can't a similar quality one on the android system.\n\nLove the product and if you're thinking about a tablet but are turned off by either the usability of other tablets or the price point, I definitely think you should look into the Samsung Galaxy tab 2 7."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I am truly overwhelmed by this tablet. I purchased this to replace my aging Palm Pilot. I primarily use this tablet to organize all of my work files and it is turnng out to be a great tool.\n\nI transferred all of my notes from my Palm consisting of nearly 500 procedures. The transfer was tedious and required beaming them to a laptop with an IR beam. I then dragged and dropped the individual procedures from the laptop to the tablet. The tablet has Polaris Office which easily converted the imported text files and stored them in the Memo tool.\n\nI imported my contacts in a similar fashion. All but a handful were successfully added to the tablet without having to re-enter them by hand. I also  dragged and dropped my photos and MP3's from the Palm to the tablet via the SD memory chip.\n\nI had numerous HanDBase databases on the Palm that I transferred by saving them to the Palm's SD memory chip. Then I transferred the databases from the memory chip to the tablet. Fortunately HanDBase has an Android version of their database program and I was able to start using my databases in minutes. HanDBase is so much easier to use on the tablet.\n\nLastly, I opted to enter my calendar appointments by hand to the S Planner.\n\nIn all, the process of transferring my information from the Palm to the tablet was painless. I now have all of my information on a much better tool and the wifi capabilities is icing on the cake. By the way, I have found the wifi to perform better than expected. I have wireless devices that do not work on the third floor of my house but this tablet works flawlessly. The GPS and mapping features are awesome. I have several GPS devices that range in price and I am really amazed at the precision and effectiveness of the built-in GPS. The battery life is very good if you don't over do it with the wifi or GPS. I usually get 7 days of battery life if I don't use the power hungry wifi/GPS. If I sparingly use the wifi/GPS then I can expect 2-3 days of usage. I have owned this tablet for 3 weeks now and I am still finding better ways to utilize it and it has been a great companion at work."}

It's very neat and does the job of storing all media and powerful enough to play games like Sonic and Shadowgun .. etc.  I wanted nexus 7 since it's pure google, but this tab has extra space for extra memory (i bought 32gb immediately!).  It's a bit laggy though but i got another launcher which makes it quite fast.  Will wait for 4.1\n\nI don't regret buying this at all, but I'd still say, if you are choosing between this and the nexus 7, go with the nexus 7 if you don't mind limited storage space (i.e. 8 or 16gb)."}

Yeah some things don't work as it should but. Its not a computer its a tablet and the youtube application sucks in this tablet and sucks on ios. it even sucks on pc but hey. thats cuz they keep adding removing bloking stuff etc and what not. so its google's fault. I have been using it mostly for chat and listenting to music (flac and other lossless formats) playing some games and browsing (although not as much as i still prefer the desktop browser experience)\n\nBeen playing a game called StrikeFleet Omega. Pretty good i recommend it. Though i would prefer to play it on a bigger screen. Another one that is pretty good is called TowerDefense thumbs up for those two games. One that was a let down was plants vs zombies. I decided to try the filtered apk before buying it to prevent it wouldnt work on ICS and it didnt. So i didn't buy it after all. Realized there are tons of complaints about the game not working on Ice Cream Sandwich. But hey what do you expect from the guys at EA. Which are the ones publishing the games for popcap.\n\nAbout the tablet. Nice audio output. I have been using PowerAmp the paid edition and it works great. Sounds nice and i have a portable DAP i use from nuforce to improve the audio experience. Video plays great as well although i rather watch movies on a big screen.\nIt sounds ok when the audio is being played by the speakers. One thing i hated is that there is almost zero accesories for this thing. It has a really good screen. and i would recommend for whoever wants to buy this to use swiftkey keyboard instead of the samsung one. only thing good about the samsung keyboard is that it has a TAB key on it.\n\nWhy is it the iPad killer for me? well for once its not as heavy as the iPad. It handles well on video calls thru skype or tang, yeah it doesnt have tons of apps. but then again i don't really like the ios closed environment whole thing. and that u have to be married with itunes.\n\nIm thinking of selling this one and getting the nexus 7 with jelly bean.\n\nWill update this review as i get more around it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I really do enjoy my Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 - The tablet was at a great price, it is fast and is well built - however, there are some quirks and some Samsung-isms that detract from what is overall a very nice 7\" tablet.  I'll try to be brief but thorough, scroll to the bottom for the cliff-notes.\n\n::Hardware::\nProcessor: Dual 1.0ghz - Pretty standard for 2012, zippy for most things but not record\n  breaking\nRam: 1gb - Again, pretty standard for ICS in a middle price point device; fine for 99% of tasks\nScreen: 1024x600 WSVGA - Gorgeous. Samsung makes pretty screens and good hardware.\nmicroSD: Accepts microSDHC (Up to 32gb of external storage) They use a dumb mnt name though ...\nmicroUSB: NONE (Samsung!  What were you thinking!)\nminiHDMI: NONE (Samsung!! Seriously!!)\n30 Pin Proprietary Port:  Yup. Instead of industry standard ports Samsung saddles this device\n  with a 30 Pin port (*cough Apple rip-off cough*) You will be stuck with Samsung brand cables\n  and accessories.  I don't know why companies think that proprietary ports are a good idea ...\n  whatever.\nCamera: 8mp Rear / 3mp Front.  They are decent but only really useful for Skype and video chat.\n  Taking pictures on a Tablet is awkward and there is no flash.\nIR Blaster:  You can control your TV (I had wondered where this feature went 7 years ago when\n  it disappeared from devices.  I'm glad it's back, it is by no means life changing but it is\n  fun.)\nSpeakers: Better than I had expected, but unfortunately they are located on the bottom so when\n  you play games or watch movies in landscape the stereo experience is lost.  Also, if you have\n  big hands and hold it from the right your hand covers the speakers muffling the sound.  Oh\n  well.\nAudio out:  Headphones work.  The jack is a little tight so you worry about breaking it the\n  first time ... but it works fine.\nBluetooth:  Works great.  Keyboards, mice, gamepads, etc.  Go nuts.\nBattery Life:  Much better than I had expected.  It generally lasts a whole day even with heavy\n  use.  It lasts longer if I am just checking the web and email occasionally.  It won't last\n  much longer than 3 days on light to moderate use.\nConnectivity:  I bought the WiFi only model and it connects well to a Wireless B/G/N router.\nBezel / Case:  The device is well built and does not feel flimsy.  It has a little weight to\n  it, but the appearance is very slick and attractive.  Occasionally, because I have big\n  thumbs, I accidentally touch the screen when holding the device one handed.  I suppose\n  someone with smaller thumbs would not have this problem.  (Thumb-ectomy?)\n\n::Software::\nOS: Ice Cream Sandwich is awesome.  Google made some great improvements with this release of\n  Android and it is much more polished than Honeycomb .... unfortunately Samsung has included\n  some \"Customization\" and several of the Android menus are truncated and some options are\n  missing.  (Mostly things like Themes.)  I guess this is leftovers from the \"Touch Wiz\" era.\n  This is too bad really, because on a stock build the device would probably run a little\n  faster and have some more UI options.  Samsung ... STOP IT!\nPre-Loaded Apps:  This is the part of the review that makes me sad.  Samsung really does make\n  gorgeous hardware, but their software is kinda crap.  They have pre-installed the Samsung\n  Media Hub, custom gallery and calendar apps, and a slew of other Samsung branded \"Features\".\n  Most of them work o.k. but you can't get rid of them and they don't really add anything to\n  the Android experience.  I wish manufacturers would stop trying to provide \"extra content\".\n  As usual the Samsung Experience apps are protected and cannot be removed without rooting.\n  You can however hide them in the app drawer so you don't have to look at them and most of\n  them do not automatically load into memory unless you tell them to.  More or less I find they\n  just take up space.  The Galaxy also comes with the standard Google apps pre-loaded.  The new\n  Ice Cream Sandwitch email app works so much better than the Gingerbread/Honeycomb one and\n  Gmail's App is much improved as well.  Also, Google Chrome is available for Ice Cream\n  Sandwich. It works well and syncs all of your bookmarks from your desktop browser if you let\n  it.\n\n::Summary::\nGreat price, nice hardware.  Runs most apps flawlessly.  (High end emulators will have to accept some frame skipping to get past the standard processor.)  If you like spending extra money on proprietary cables, there are a slew of accessories from the Galaxy Tab 1 7.0 that will work fine with this.\n\nHardware - 5/5  (*For this price point)\nSoftware - 3/5  (*Ugh!  Samsung warez!)\n\nGalaxy 2 7.0 vs. Kindle Fire = Buy this tablet!  It crushes the Fire in processing and overall user experience.\nGalaxy 2 7.0 vs. Nexus 7 = Hmm ... depends on how important microSD is to you.  Probably get the Nexus 7."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Let me start this review by saying that I do own a \"New\" Ipad.  I do love the Ipad I wanted a smaller tablet, something that I could put into my pocket if possible, but something smaller and easier to transport.\n\nThe pros:\nThe 7\" screen my not be \"HD\" but it you would not know that unless someone told you that.  The images are very sharp.  I like that I can change memory cards so I can have tons of video or pictures.  Basically I'm only limited to how many and the size of the memory cards I own.  This is very light.\n\nCons:\nWhile I can change the memory card when I want to, I do have a hard time sometimes getting the memory card out of the tablet.  It's supposed to work on the push the memory card in and it pops out just a little so you can grab it.  I have a hard time with this, sometimes.  For this reason only I have to give it 4 stars because it really does bother me.\n\nIn conclusion you can't go wrong with this 7\" tablet.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I have had this tablet for 3 months now. I'm gonna start with the bad because i'm a negative individual. =) Ok the app store for this device has little support. Especially with Gameloft and some other high end games. This more has to do with the play store in general but buying an app to find out it doesn't work and hopefully staying with in the 15 minute window so that you can return the app is a pain. Sometimes it takes 20 minutes or more just for the app to recognize the program as being payed for and not stolen so it will take you 20+ minutes just to start the app and then you have to hassle with the developer. That's something apple got right. Other then that the device runs smooth and fast. Everything is easy to use. With all the complaints about the app store i love how laid back the app store is. I have an ipod and never had an android so i'm surprised at the apps that are aloud on there without needing an exploit. Again that's the app store and not the device. The tablet is very sturdy. I like that they used plastic and not metal and glass. Metal gets cold and glass is dangerous as well as breaks easily. plastic is soft and i would think it's better if it were dropped. It also won't shatter into dangerous shards. I don't use the camera but i heard it sucked. I have an actual camera so i don't need it. The speakers are very loud. It has great screen brightness which is also easy to access. In fact everything is very easy to access. A big problem though like anything that doesn't bare the name apple on it is that the accessories are hard to come buy. I mean if you see a sign in a store that says mp3 player you know what that really means... iPod. anyways all in all this is a great device for the price tag and i think it's also a perfect size as well."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I purchased this item from Crutchfield but decided to review it on Amazon since more people would probably see it. There were many who said this would be a bad purchase with the Google Nexus 7 being released. The Nexus 7 is a nice tablet and trumps the Tab in screen resolution and processor power. But neither the Nexus 7 nor Amazon's Fire appeals to me, and many others, because they lack a micro-SD storage slot and support for USB host mode (also called USB On The Go). The lack of a storage slot alone is a deal killer for me. And since I use the tablet to control my Canon T1i using a very cool Android app called DSLR Controller, the USB OTG function is important also. Though no match for the Nexus 7 in resolution, the Tab's screen is very nice and the dual core processor is very peppy. HD videos play beautifully with MX Player. I also installed GPS Test from the Google Play Store and the Tab picked up more than a dozen satellites inside my home under a metal roof and got a position fix in seconds. So it should be a fine GPS navigation device with the appropriate software. I could go on about how well it runs other apps I've installed, but the point of this review is mostly to disabuse potential buyers of the notion that this tablet has become completely obsolete because of the Nexus 7. It's still a bargain and for some of us a better choice than the Nexus 7. I love the size, features, and performance. You can safely make a buying decision based on your particular needs."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Short review:\n\nNice screen, halfway decent camera and camcorder (no autofocus, though), and a good size to hold in your hand.\n\nHowever....\n\nThe Wifi antennae is VERY weak on this device.  I use an AT&T Uverse Wifi modem in my house - a very standard unit and one used by a good number of people in my particular area.  It's been out a while as well, so is not an odd standard or unknown third-party device.  I noticed quickly that I was dropping Skype video calls on my Samsung Tab, then I noticed Netflix movies were buffering, and Youtube videos would do the same, all with me being only two rooms away from my router.  Through coworkers, friends, and a neighbor, I have had people come over to my house and test their devices on my Wifi, so we've had a range of Android phones, a couple of iPhones, and one iPad in here trying it out.  Everyone averaged around 12-18 Mbps download speeds on their devices, when in my living room, two rooms away from the router.  My Samsung Tab barely got one bar of signal, and averaged around .5 to 1.5 Mbps download speeds (if that).  Same room, same location in room, etc.\n\nThere are no updates to the device software.  Samsung support ranges from \"we're aware of it\" to \"send it in for repair\".  I'll be taking it back to where I purchased it as my \"repair\" - sorry, I'm tired of companies using the public to test their devices before they have.  That's my experience, yours may vary.\n\nUPDATE (April 2013):\n\nDecided to try this again as by now the kinks should have been worked out on newer production stock, so went back to the Big Box store and got one that runs Android 4.1 (instead of the previous unit's 4.0), showing it's an updated model.  This time, the WiFi worked *slightly* better with *slightly* better range than the previous unit, this time averaging about 6-8 MPS on average (in a 22 MPS area, however).  I noticed that for whatever reason, this unit had more \"bloatware\" apps installed than my last unit, that cannot be removed, and upon investigation many of them keep trying to kick on constantly even after you disable them (?).  Not a deal breaker, but irritating.  The \"up to 11 hour\" battery life is also stretched of course, too - with consistent normal use I'd say it's more like 7 1/2 hours depending on what you're doing.\n\nThis is app-specific but worth noting too - I tried a very popular scanner app that allows you to create PDF documents of papers you have, and upon installing I was told by it it was not compatible with this device because the Tab 7\" only has a 3 megapixel camera on the back, and you really need at least 5 megapixels to be table to clearly scan documents.  I know this is specific, but something worth noting, as people do like to get smaller tablets for work uses as well.\n\nOverall I upped my rating one star from 2 to 3 but there are still enough quirks and irritations to make me tell someone to look further (maybe a Nexus) unless they are getting one specifically just for very casual uses like Netflix, etc."}

After much pondering, I purchased it.  I absolutely love it!  The browser is much faster than I expected and the visual quality of the pics and videos are much better than I expected.  This device is axiomatic for most people probably, with not much use for the user manual.  I looked at the manual after I had used it all day and already had it set up like I wanted it with apps, icons on the screens, etc.  The battery life is better than I expected.  I often checked the battery level after watching a Netflix movie and found only about 10-12% drain on the battery level.\n\nI would recommend getting a stand and a nice case for it.  The stand so you are less likely to drop it and the case so if you do drop it, it hopefully will protect it.  It is very easy to slip out of your hands, so be careful.  I'm still looking for a rubberized perimeter protector for it and haven't located on yet.  Buy a micro SD card too for extra space.  I bought a 16 GB to go with mine.\n\nI have noticed that I use my laptop less now, so that will extend the life of my laptop hopefully.  Facebook, e-mail, weather, and reading news is a very nice experience on this device.  I got the 7 inch one instead the 10 inch.  I held the 10 inch and it just seemed too big to be convenient.  I have no regrets with the 7 inch. It is large enough for ease of use, but not too big for a bulky experience.  I hope this is helpful."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I got this tablet because I wanted more screen area and was sick of using my iPod Touch for all my internet browsing on the couch and on the go. I had high hopes for this, but it turned out to be just OK. I know everyone says you shouldn't compare these cheaper tablets to the apple tablets, so I'm going to compare it to my Apple iPod touch... seems more even and what I was used to, right?\n\nThe Bad: I agree with previous reviewers in that the touch of your finger on the screen seems slightly off... and there is no way to calibrate it. The keyboard is absolutely frustrating to use, in either horizontal or vertical format - it is just an annoying pain. I had an easier time typing on my little iPod!!! This is either a Samsung issue or it's an android thing... I wouldn't know as I am mostly an Apple user. I was also extremely annoyed that it didn't come with an auto-correct or any spell check built in. Also the enter button is right next to the delete button, so when I have to go back constantly to fix what I typed, I would sometimes hit enter instead (on facebook for example) and it would post my half finished, badly spelled message. Another thing is there is no up/down/left/right arrow to quickly move the cursor, you have to use the clunky touch to try to get it where you want, which isn't smooth at all (again, an android issue or Samsung, I'm not sure). Another thing I've found coming from my little iPod touch is that the Android apps for this seem to be more clumsy and with less features. I really am not too fond of the facebook, ebay, and amazon apps that are available for this... not a huge deal since you can still go to the actual website, but I would have thought they would be really similar, unfortunately no.\n\nThe Good: It seems to be pretty lightweight. The screen is really nice and clear due to the higher pixel count for it's size. I like how in the browser you have the option to request a desktop website, because sometimes the mobile sites seem odd on the 7\" screen, since they are mostly built for smaller phone screens. Flash does work in the default web browser, although I've found I like using google chrome instead, which doesn't support flash. It does have tabbed browsing on both browsers, which I like and was used to. Everything seems to be pretty quick on this, I've only had a little web lag when I had multiple tabs open. The task manager works great to clear some RAM if you need it.\n\nAll in all, I kind of have a love/hate relationship with this tablet. It is definitely nice to have the larger screen, but at times I find myself cursing at it in my head. Don't expect to do any fast word processing, or facebooking it up : ) If you have big sausage fingers you will probably have an even harder time, as I have pretty narrow fingers and still have this thing hitting letters I don't want.\n\nEDIT: I changed my review to 4 stars since my last review. I tried out the hackers keyboard program from the app store, and also the GO Keyboard, and am using the GO. This is MUCH better than the Samsung factory keyboard. Ive been getting used to other features of the tablet as well, so four stars.\n\nEDIT 2: Updated to the new software and the standard keyboard has changed and is much more responsive and now has auto correct and spell check."}

The other day, my cable provider released an Android app, so now I can watch cable TV on my tab too!  I hesitated between the 7 inch and 10 inch, but I'm glad I got the 7 inch.  The screen is super-sharp and bright, and the 7 inch is easy to carry, easy to prop up in the stand, it's perfect.  Here's a tip though, get one of the 360 degree rotating cases, it's really worthwhile to be able to stand it up either landscape for movie watching or portrait for book reading.  Yes, you can get the Kindle and Nook apps for it too.  What's not to like?"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I purchased this 7inch tablet for use as a student in medical clinical settings and of course during leisure time as well. I purchased this based on my satisfaction of other Samsung products and my liking of their original 10.1 tablet. I won't make this too lengthy and will get right to the point, starting with a list of pro's and con's.\n\nPros\n-Expandable memory (up to 32gb)\n-Icecream sandwich OS (Soon to be outdated, see below)\n-IR Port\n-Front and rear camera\n-Good WiFi reception\n\nCons\n-My biggest issue with this tablet was the screen and I noticed this on all units I have been able to take a look at. The color calibration on this is EXTREMELY below Samsung standards. This was the worst screen I have ever witnessed on a Samsung product. When compared to the Kindle Fire and other tablets in this tier,the biggest thing I noted was the galaxy tab's whites are more of a cream and have a dirty look. It's possible this may be corrected in an update in the future but as for now, how did this ever make it to the consumer market?!?!\n\n-Icecream Sandwich will soon be outdated by Jellybean. I have had 4 other Samsung Android devices and they are notoriously slow getting Android updates out. Feel free to look this up if you don't believe me, it's a fact.\n\n-Also because it is Samsung, you do not get the full Android experience but instead you will get it mixed with their Touchwiz software. I have found this to have a very negative impact on the performance of this tablet and more often than not, just gets in the way.\n\n-The iconic Icecream Sandwich face unlock feature that was so advertised with the OS release? You won't find that it on this tablet because Samsung doesn't support it.\n\n-The IR port does not have a paired Samsung application to run it. Instead you will be directed to install the Peel Reel app to make use of it. It is one of extremely few apps that can make it work. Peel Reel is somewhat buggy and requires an internet connection to use (you can see it's reviews in the Google Play Store, will improve over time I am sure). I found that it works well on Sony and Dynex televisions, but for some reason it just couldn't master an LG flat screen. Something for Peel Reel to work on, but why no Samsung App to support this?!?!\n\n-I put the cameras in PRO because they are included unlike some other tablets, but their quality limits their usefulness. You will be able to video chat, but be prepared to look pixelated.\n\n-I mentioned performance before, but I wanted to throw in about requiring restarts too. I thought we had moved away from the tech limitation of having to restart a device to clear tasks, RAM, etc. but apparently not. When you turn on the tab you may be able to play a graphic intense game or an equivalent on this tab, but later in your session, you will see some lag times on it without a restart. Samsung includes it's own task manager but it does not clear up the lag with extended use.\n\n-The touch sensitivity needs to be stronger and their is no option to increase this, expect a few double taps along the way.\n\nAt the time of this tablets release this is the most superior 7inch tablet and easily kills the Kindle Fire in performance. However based on the issues stated above, I recently sold my Galaxy Tab 2 7in. and pre-ordered the upcoming Galaxy Nexus 7. I will not go into it's specs on this review, but I would encourage everyone looking to get into the 7inch tablet field to give a look at the Nexus 7 or wait on the next generation of the Kindle Fire. The Galaxy Tab 2 7in. just isn't worth it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "This is my first tablet so I can't compare it to others but I did do a ton of research before buying.  The critical features were size, the 10 inch just isn't portable enough, memory expansion slot, everyone wants the SD slot but few pads have them,  front and rear facing camera, android market, and speed.  The Galaxy Tab 2 had all of this at half the price of an IPad which I understand is the industry standard.\n\nI've had it about a week and have no complaints. I've been able to do everything I expected to do and more.  the camera is not great but It's mainly used for fun photo's.  You can't get great pics from a micro lens I don't care what anyone says. So I have a real camera for pictures that I want to look great.  This is just for taking snaps as I go along of stuff I want to show someone.\n\nThe battery has no problem lasting all day long.  I've watched 2 hour long shows on Netflix back to back after a regular day of occasional use and the battery still had juice so I believe watching a movie or some other extended video display would be no problem.\n\nThe only really odd thing is that I use linux based operating systems at work and home and this thing won't interface with it,  even though it IS a linux operating system.  That's just wrong.  It has no problems interfacing with Windows and I was able to drag and drop music and movies onto the tablet.\n\nI'm very happy with the purchase but the real test is how long will this thing last."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "This is my first foray into the world of tablets, so I don't really have anything to compare this to, but I'm having a lot of fun with this little tablet. I really, really wanted a tablet and the Galaxy's price was right. I think it's probably a good starter tablet. It took me a couple of weeks just to get used to using the touch screen because I've never had one before, and then about a month to work my way through all the apps that were already installed on it, to figure out what they did and which ones I wanted to keep using.\n\nI think of this as my Google Galaxy because I have easy access to my Gmail, Google docs, contacts, Google Play, Google books, Google music, Google everything, right on the home screen. And I like the little whistle it makes when I have new email.\n\nOh, and I can't forget my Kindle app. If I want to spend an hour or more reading, I prefer my actual Kindle, but the Kindle app is great for a quick bit of reading here and there and it synchs with my Kindle so I can pick up where I left off on either device. Also, I've found that the Kindle app is the best choice for displaying PDFs (among the choices that came already installed). The Galaxy is the same size as my Kindle so it's easy to take along everywhere I go.\n\nAt first, typing on the touch screen drove me crazy, but now I'm pretty good at it. However, I would never use it for a lot of typing, just short emails. (I'm typing this on my laptop, not the Galaxy.) I still have trouble with the tiny \"x\" on the browser when I want to close a screen. I have to try several times before I hit it just right, toggling back and forth between the screen I want to keep and the screen I want to close. Arrrrgh! But, nevertheless, I'm having a lot of fun with this little gadget and I'm glad I bought it."}

Since I have an android phone, getting around the tablet was a breeze. The screen was good quality, though my phone seems more crisp. It was a little slow to react to my touch a few times. After using it for about 30 minutes to an hour it began getting very hot on the left side. I liked that I could hold it in one hand. I really liked this tablet, but the main reason I gave it three stars is because of the tablet getting hot and there was a blue dot continuously near the top left of the screen. It was a bad pixel and I even tried a few things to fix it, but it wouldn't go away. It was very obvious when watching movies. I also didn't like that when I went to a website, I couldn't hit full screen for videos. It would just let me zoom in, and the main buttons were on the bottom. They were continuously lit up and just annoying. For the price it is a great tablet, but I would advise just waiting since there are about to be some new tablets on the way.\nPros: Price, customization, display, size.\nCons: Web browser, overheating, random blue dot.\n\nUpdate 7/4/2012, added another star.\nI sent it back to amazon and picked up another one at Best Buy to try it one more time. This one was much better right from the start. It got a little warm while I recovered all my apps, but no where near how hot my previous one I had. The screen was also perfect, my first one had a messed up pixel. Maybe the first one I received was just a bad one. I absolutely love this tablet and with its price it can't be beat!"}

Battery life is excellent. The features work as advertised and it is a high quality unit. That said I ordered the Nexus 7 - in spite of the lack of SD slot. These are the reasons. I personally hate the 30 pin adapter that is needed to charge the unit. Maybe we will get HDMI from it - if Samsung ever released an adapter that will work with it. But at this point it is simply a more complicated and fragile charging/USB port and if I lose it I am SOL. Nexus 7 wisely uses standard micro USB. Next - the screen resolution on the Samsung means that you often have to move web pages sideways to activate buttons as so many sites are designed 1280 pixels wide. The Nexus 7 has 1280 resolution. It is aggravating to have to move your pages around to locate buttons. As far as storage I will buy one of those new wireless portable hard drives. Bottom line is the Samsung is GREAT, but for my needs the Nexus looks better."}

So I bought this tab. After 3 days of usage, I would say it fits my needs well. I don't care much about HD or full HD or WXVGA, I would reach out for my laptop anyway for most of the tasks, as I find it more productive. The battery is decent, comparable to most of the tablets on the market. Charging time is a little longer than say Asus tablets, but I do it at night mostly. Another thing I noticed is that the charging cable is short like all other Samsung tablets, which is slightly frustrating.\n\nNow comparing it with the nexus. The Nexus has all the hardware better than this, but there are a couple of reasons I am considering keeping this device. 1 - No sdcard support on Nexus. I will be using my device mostly for music storage, and 16 GB is quite limiting for me. I can manage by juggling my files around, but that would be frequent enough to annoy me, I think. Plus, if I use streaming services like Spotify or Rdio, I will have serious loss of space. 2 - It's Asus. All those who have tried their tablets know about the pathetic browser issue. Given the fact that even Prime has it, I doubt they would have resolved it in this one. That's something to look out for!"}

Amazon delivery and CS has been excellent but the performance of the unit and Samsung's CS sub-standard. I had great hopes based on Samsung's good name and the Tab's great features for the price. Being that this is a Wi-Fi model, I am rating it poorly because of it's inability to connect me to the internet.\nI have linked multiple devices, laptops and smart-phones using various OS to my Wi-Fi Network w/out ANY glitches, BUT the Galaxy Tab couldn't yield a real/true connection. I am versed in setting up Networks and Wi-Fi connections, and Samsung's CS asked me twice to send the unit back calling it faulty. Two brand new units ? Let's get real! Unfortunately I can't stop to come to the conclusion that something in the hardware or software is not being able to fully connect with Wi-Fi's properly. I am using an N router and tried many ways to resolve the issue. From the beginning the Tab would identify the signal with the correct SSID and reported a strong signal and was unable to obtain the IP address and was not able to connect. I followed their suggestions by a) manually entering my network b) resetting the tab and c) entering the network spec's w/ a Static mode. All along the security password was recognized and secured. When using the static option I was finally able to achieve a connected status ( a short lived yeah!). While under \"connected\" status I was NOT able to truly connect to the internet or a google account, either the one I have been using, or even creating a new one. I spent 2.5 hours combined between phone CS and Chat CS to end up with their advise to return the unit and get a replacement.\nI have wasted enough time and will not get a Samsung Galaxy Tab. I honestly wish it would have worked, but if it is going to be this hazzle on a perfectly good network/WiFi set-up I don't want to waste more time and/or have this degree of difficulty when trying to link to other networks. Under the CS guidance we even switched my N Router to the b & g modes and it failed as well.\nI am again on the research mode to see which 7\" Tab to get??  I don't like to bash a manufacturer and am hoping that this is a glitch that Samsung will correct. It has been a very wasteful experience; my time and Amazon's money absorbing the shipping costs! One of Samsung's CS said to me that my case was not unique, that he has seen other reports of inability of the Tab to connect with some WiFi's."}

I previously bought a $150 tab and ended up returning it because it was under powered (IMO, you really need dual core CPU to properly run ICS 4), and my research indicated that the really cheap devices couldn't even play netflix movies properly.\n\nI added a few 'accessories' that further enhanced the quality and usage\n- a Poetic case for ~$18 that fits like a glove and is very functional (multiple viewing angles for movies, enhanced grip and no fingerprints, good protection)\n- a good screen protector (originally designed for the 1st samsung galaxy tab 7) that gives a smoother feel when swiping on the screen\n- turned on the \"hotspot\" feature on my android phone (extra monthly fee from verizon), so now I have 4G with this tablet anywhere there is 4G service...sweeeeeet!\n\nPros:\n- netflix runs great on it\n- good ebook reading experience\n- screen quality is very good for doing the above\n- camera - only because it's better than not having one at all (it's not great, but not as bad as some have written).\n- 7\" rules for portability and comfortable reading.

It handles games and hd video very well.  The cameras are sufficient for a tablet, but certainly nothing special and you can definitely tell that this is where Samsung cut some money out in comparison to the 7.0 Plus.  With sub $250 Quad-core 7\" tabs on the verge of release, I felt a slight urge to return my Tab 2, but the built-in IR blaster and free Peel remote service really is awesome.  I will likely buy the Nexus tablet when it is released and keep this Tab as the coffee table tablet :)"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "This is a very well build nice tablet, which does its job without any problems. It is not a performance monster, nor a very poor machine. It has a very good performance/price ratio.\n\nI am actually very happy that I didn't had to re-configure every bit of software like I did in my previous Samsung Android phones. Samsung did a nice job this time by focusing more on the software.\n\nThe battery life is good. Although not an OLED, screen is okay. There was a small brighter area on bottom left of my screen, but it doesn't bother me since I'm not doing any graphic work with it. I haven't faced any problems with wireless or bluetooth. Both worked nicely in my house with my wireless router or paired with my phone. The infrared control could have been fun if I was living in US. But it is pretty useless right now.\n\nOnly problematic part is the terrible terrible camera. I wish they didn't even put it there. It is really awful. And I mean really awful like my iPhone 3GS which dates to 2009.\n\nMy point in buying this device was to relieve me carrying my laptop around but giving me chance to browse the web, to use social sharing applications and to be able to communicate with video. All in all, this is a great product for its price."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Let me first say that I am no stranger to the tablet market. I started with the iPad 2 but then moved over to the 7\" tablet form factor because I found that size to ultimately be more suited to my needs.\n\nI'm a big fan of Samsung products anyway (already have one of their phones) and so I started to dabble with their 7\" tablets, starting with the gTab 7.0 plus. I liked it, but I wasn't wild about it, so I ended up selling it.\n\nNext I tried the gTab 7.7 from Verizon and, while it had an awesome screen and it blazed on 4g, I found that many apps didn't account for the additional screen size and so fonts were disproportionately small a lot of the time...not to mention that the 2 year commitment and initial price (despite being subsidized through the carrier) gave me more than one restless night's sleep, so ultimately  - given that for the monthly and up front cost, it wasn't rolling my socks up and down - it went back.\n\nEnter the gTab 2 7\" tablet. This one has proven to be the Goldilocks tablet for me...just right.\n\nFirst of all, it runs ICS which (IMHO) makes a huge difference in the user experience on a tablet over Gingerbread. Perhaps just because I am used to ICS from my Nexus phone, but I found this tablet iteration to be the most pleasant to use out of all of them.\n\nObviously the gTab 2 7\" can't out-spec the 7.7, but having had a 7.0 Plus, I can honestly say the differences are negligible. Is the Plus faster? Yes, a bit...but it was (at the time) also $399 to the tab 2's $249.\n\nI carry this Tab with me daily in my purse. It is solid enough to feel good in the hand, but still light enough not to make having it in my bag or holding it up for long periods of reading a burden. The screen may only be 170 ppi, and only 1024 x 600 resolution, but to be honest, it looks great just the same. I stream Netflix on it as well as play movies from an SD card and in my opinion it is a very good video watching experience.\n\nThe cameras are only meh, but I have Skyped on it and it does fine. There were no complaints on either end as to quality.\n\nFor the most part, I use my Tab as a consumption device; I watch movies, browse news aggregating apps like Pulse, read books (and for $249 I can have both my Kindle books and my Nook books with me on one device...sweet!), stream music, spend time on social media and waste my life playing Draw Something.  I do appreciate the larger screen for managing my calendar and I have had occasion to do actual work on the thing too (though not often), which has been a good experience as well. In other words, I am not what you would call a power user - I am just your average consumer looking for a good product at a decent price point.\n\nPersonally, I just love it. I think the price is right for what it is, and I really like that (as opposed to the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet - both of which are good devices, don't get me wrong) I can have an honest to goodness Android experience with the Google Play Store, etc.\n\nDid Samsung need to put out yet another Galaxy Tab model? Probably not...but I have to say, owning this one, that I'm glad they did."}

Has a arrow that pops up Widgets that overlay apps like a Calculator, Notepad, Memo, Task list. So when I'm using Mint I can use the calculator and be in Mint at the same time. That to me was very impressive. It's true multitasking. I feel like everything is 1-2 clicks away. I bought the Memory adapter that gives me an extra 32GB of storage when I need/want it and have up to 72GB of storage. It's loaded with all my music and movies. The Peel app let's me use it as a remote control for my TV. I haven't gone anywhere without it, since it fits so easily in my backpocket.\n\nThis tablet has made me an Android Fanboy for sure. It does everything an iPad doesn't: 7\", Widgets, In Browser flash, Touchwiz, Built in Remote receiver, Torrent downloader, expandable storage...etc.\n\nthe seller was also great. I paid for overnight around noon and got it the next day in great condition. Definitely happy with my purchase."}

Thought I would pick-up the Samsung Tab 2 to ease the bottleneck on my phone.\n\nAlthough it has a poorer screen image than my phone, it was adequate.  However, I am returning the phone - IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAVE APPS TO THE SD CARD!!!!!  I could never get my filemaker program to work either.\n\nCalled Samsung Support who verified that it cannot be done.  Sean (at Samsung) really know very little about the tablet, so I asked to speak with a supervisor. Hoped to find out if an update was in the works to solve this problem.  Was told he was on the phone and would call me back right after that call - he didn't.\n\nI wanted to load this with Apps for my grandchildren.  I couldn't.  It is going back~\n\nI purchased this from a company with a very liberal return policy; be sure you do the same!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Purchased this tablet from my mother for her birthday and ended up getting my wife one for Mother's Day. The ease of use paired with the expandable memory and ICS make this a fun tablet to use. Also I feel you get the most bang for your buck. The camera is not the greatest but we rarely use the on board camera for anything other than quick video chats. The other thing that I like about this tablet is there is not a lot of fluff app preloaded. The only drawback is the lack of aftermarket products available for the Tab 2 7.0. we have resorted to using a Kindle portfolio until a decent case is put on the market."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "First, the downsides of the tablet:\n-It only has 8 GB of RAM, and half of that is taken by the bloatware Samsung has installed on the tablet, and cannot be removed.\n-The cameras are horrible. The front-facing camera is VGA resolution and guaranteed to make you look bad in video chat, and the rear facing camera is 3 megapixels and fixed focus, so things like bar code scanners won't work with it. There is no flash or assistive light. Basically, if you ever think you want to use the camera for anything, buy something else.\n-There is no indicator LED on the tablet, for notifications or charging status or anything else.\n-Finding cases for it is tough.\n-Some applications don't work too well, as they assume a bigger screen.\n-Doesn't support larger MicroSD cards, only HC.\n-The connector is proprietary, so you can't use standard USB variants to charge it.\n-No HD out, even through the docking connector.\n-No 5 GHz WiFi.\n-Bluetooth compatibility issues with SPP class 0 devices.\n\nHere are the upsides:\n+In build quality, comparing it to the only other 7\" tablet on the market (the Acer Iconia) for the same price you get a thinner and lighter tablet that feels vastly better. The Samsung is really well built, the materials are nice to the touch, and it's comfortable to hold.\n+It's fairly responsive (unless you load it up with apps).\n+The screen is nice, and the touch interface works well.\n+I've been satisfied with the battery life.\n+It's very good value for the money."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "The Samsung tablet had a nice build quality and screen, however, I was unable to download music or books from Amazon because the tablet kept redirecting the browser to the Samsung media store. I could not see or find the PDF files stored on my 32 gig  hi-speed micro SD card. I couldn't make the home screen look like I wanted it to. The documentation included in the box was sub-standard - not nearly enough information. I had to go online and locate and download more tech info. Previously, I had an Archos tablet with the older Android OS. I was able to configure the tablet and home screen exactly as I wanted to see it and all my camera manuals were stored and easily accessible in folders on the SD card. It may be possible to do this on the Samsung, but I sure couldn't figure out how and didn't want fiddle with it anymore. The browser redirecting to unwanted URL's was the deciding factor. I sent it back."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "So this is not my first Android or Samsung device but I have to say for under $250 it sure is a fun toy!  I had a Kindle Fire and have switch.  Why? Becuase they are both 7 inches but the Galaxy has way more feature and full Android Play store. No need to go there for this review.\n\nHere's my observation and experience so far using it for a few days.\n\nDisplay -\nObviously, AMOLED kicks rear as typical with all Samsung devices.\n\nScreen -\nLayout is a little lacking in terms of height/width adjustments.  I do not like the extra spacing between the clock and the weather, should've made it a little tigher together.  I felt the open spaces between widgets and icons just was useless and a waste of screen real estate..\n\nSound  -\nMuch much louder than a Kindle for sure.  This is awesome on flights where you sit near the engine.\n\nBattery -\nSo far so good, I left it on with my WIFI on all day and came back after 9 hours of work to find it at 97%.  Not bad at all.  Have yet to play 2-3 movies to see if it'll hold up against what the Kindle can do on a 5hr flight. TBD\n\nWIFI -\ndoes not see ad-hoc wifi (wifi tethering on phones), but nothing Foxfi BT or Rooting won't solve.  Not a killer deal but sucks compared to Kindle.\n\nSignal strength is fine for work or office and locks on quick.\n\nGPS -\nNot not yet used, don't care to use it since I have a Galaxy 2 phone.\n\nForm factor -\nLove it, great size, good feel to it, light enough to not feel fatigue when holding.  Though I have ordered a case and screen protector (which I always do).\n\nMemory size -\nYes like everyone says, around 3.5GB left on internal memory.  Nothing Rooting won't solve with APP to SD. :)  Love the External SD option.\n\nCharging cable , interface  -\nThis is where I hate.  Come'on Samsung don't you ever learn?  Galaxy 10 and now this? Who puts in a proprietary plug (I won't name Apple... Opps I did).  Also the cable is not long enough! Even the Kindle and Iconia had micro USB and both I've owned in the past.\n\nBLOAT WARE / Software?\nMy other grip is no SWYPE! After using it on my G2 phone I need it, Samsung phone is Samsung, is Samsung Tablet not made by Samsung?  Does the company not talk to each other and have some kind of standard on what comes with a Samsung Android device? WTFail.  No Swype is sad, get up to speed and get your act together.\n\nThat's all for now.  So I guess you can't have it all so I took 1 star off due to the charging cable/proprietary plug and lacking Swype."}

I had a tablet before,and this surpasses it. I like the camera just fine. It took great pictures that captured moments and the pictures were loved by family members I shared them with. This will not replace my digital camera, but honestly, I feel like I take better pictures with the tab. Hmmmm, something for me to ponder.\n\nI love the size of the tablet. I often feel overloaded with the stuff i carry with me and this fits in just fine with my downsized bag. It is the perfect size for browsing online news sites at lunch, looking up knitting stuff, or using as a remote at home.\n\nSpeaking of remotes, the tablet is a great remote. I have the RoByte app installed to control our Roku streaming player. I also use the pre installed Peel app to control my TV's and DVD player. This is a godsend for a household that always misplaces remotes.\n\nThe display is sharp and clear. Netflix and YouTube run well with lovely clarity. My pictures look great and detailed. I have downloaded the kindle reader along with the apps for kobo and the nook readers. I have a kindle touch for regular books, but looking at instructional books in color is awesome. Just awesome.\n\nThe sound is clear, did not get tinny when turned up.\n\nI would recommend this for anyone looking for a sleek, but solid tablet that is compact enough so that you don't feel weighed down.\n\nAnd the price...\nI can't believe how much bang i got for my buck."}

An added bonus which I did not realize I would get is that it also runs the Overdrive application so that I can access library books directly from the device and not have to download and transfer them as I did with my Nook.  I run all three of the major reading apps (Kindle, Nook and Overdrive) and all work well.\n\nI also use this as a web browser when I travel.  It is far better than carrying a laptop, and much more readable than my smartphone for internet use.  Sites seem to load well, and once you learn to not hold the device at the lower left hand corner the wireless connects easily and quickly, and is pretty stable once connected.\n\nIs it a heavy duty laptop replacement?  No, but it does work well for browsing the internet, email (both yahoo and gmail), and it is a GREAT e-reader.  It is far superior to my nook tablet."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I'm an Android fan from way back, and picking this up from Amazon for a Father's Day self-gift was easy. Amazon had it to me in two days and I charged it for a couple of hours before turning it on and setting it up. Sure, I was stepping up to the Ice Cream Sandwich operating system from Gingerbread on my Droid phone, but that shouldn't be much of a switch, right?\n\nWrong! I've been pounding on keyboards and phones for a long time, but my first 15 minutes on the Galaxy Tab 2 was not as simple as I thought it would be. I couldn't quite figure out the icons for moving around and my Gmail account did not get setup correctly. I contacted Samsung's online Support chat function and they were nearly worthless. They told me to click on options that didn't exist, so I had the Tab back in the box, ready to ship back to Amazon.\n\nWell, I gave the Tab another chance, wiped the deck clean (I reset the device to its original out-of-the-box state) and started over. The second time was the charm. My Gmail account was setup just fine (I use Google's Authentication function on my Google accounts, so that may have affected my first attempt) and the Tab has shined brightly ever since. The device is a quality build, a perfect size and integrates with my Google applications very nicely. Netflix runs my movie selections flawlessly and the battery seems to last a long time between charges. For $249, it is a steal. I toyed with the original Amazon Kindle Fire when it came out, but it is very limited in comparison with the Tab 2. If you want a really good reader and Amazon store browser, the Kindle Fire is a great tablet for those things. If you want to pay 25% more, but end up with a tablet that can do a lot more online and with Google Play Store applications, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is your next tablet computer.\n\nPositives:\nHigh quality build - it feels like a well designed tablet in your hand\nGreat size - if you want a screen bigger than your phone, but small enough to read a book upon, the seven inch tablet form factor is great. The iPad is waaaaaay too big and clunky for causal reading.\nFast - screen switching from landscape to portrait is 'right there'. Moving among screens is smooth and quick.\nDisplay - gorgeous. Vibrant colors, natural and realistic.\nOpen - you can sideload apps (get them from non-google and non-Amazon sources) and the machine is not just an Amazon tool.\nExpandable - you can add a microSD card to this to expand your storage, add movies, music, etc.\nKeyboard - nice size and quite accurate. (If you've typed on a smartphone, you know how challenging it can be to keystroke accurately.)\n\nNegatives:\nSound - there seems to be just one speaker, at the bottom. It is easy, while watching Netflix, to cover it with your hand. The sound is ok, but won't win any awards for faithful reproduction of low notes.\nSamsung support - they don't make it easy and their techs don't seem to know this new product very well yet. Phone support would be helpful, but Samsung uses a very slow paced chat service where you type in your questions and the tech takes FOREVER to respond. (But don't take long, yourself, to respond to them, or they'll terminate the chat!)"}

I have a 32.gb micro .sd card in mine loaded with movies, pictures, and music along with documents.  Plenty of internal memory for apps and games. The display is excellent, making for excellent video watching, and sound quality is excellent for music as well as movies.  There is very little I can't do that I could do with the Kindle namely watching Prime videos and shopping on Amazon is a much better experience with the Kindle Fire.

This menu also has a set button for access to the full settings menu and immediate access to the screen brightness control as well as ongoing audio and notification. At the bottom of the screen there is also a button for instant access to mini apps including email, calculator, alarm,music player, planner, world clock,and task manager. These mini apps pull up small windows in the center of the screen that allow quick access to these features without leaving the screen you are working on. There is also an instant screenshot button and a button that pulls up apps that you have previously been working on giving you the ability to quickly return to them.\nThe camera takes excellent photos and videos and the forward facing camera is not all that great but does allow for selfportriats and face time. I personally make VERY little use of the camera but thought it was worth commenting on.\nThe GPS works great, just as it would on a good smart phone although it will not give you driving instructions without wifi.\nThe built in mic allows for use if voice dictation when emailing, writing Amazon reviews etc. I admittedly have very little experience with using this feature.\nThe Bluetooth feature was probably my biggest complaint about the Kindle Fire but this device does make use of it making listening to music untethered a pleasant experience as well as transferring data between bluetooth devices seamless and quick.\nWeb browsing is excellent on this tab, very quick and fit to screen is excellent as although pinch to zoom can sometimes be a little laggy.\nThis device comes with Polaris Office as it's native document program instead of Quick office. I have lots of evperience with DataViz, Quick office, and Office Suite as I read and edit documents on my mobile devices daily and Polaris blows all the other doc readers out of the water with it's (my opinion only) ease of use, and is visually very pleasing. I still use Office Suite some as I am more familiar with it by I expect that will come to an end as I become more familiar with Polaris.\nThe IR blaster was a surprising touch as I can program my tablet to control my TV and other IR devices in multiple rooms. Though there are glitches with the native Samsung app that makes use of the IR abilities it is still very nice.\nBattery life is one thing I don't complain about vs other reviews.  I get a full days use from a single charge, even if I use it a lot, however I keep the screen brightness down and unused features off like GPS, notifications, wifi if not on the net etc.  I do the vast majority of my internet surfing from this device as well as TuneIn radio, mp3, Amazon mp3, Rahpsody, and YouTube and get a good 8 hours or more out of the device. I do believe screen brightness and of course streaming video or audio are the major factors when it comes to battery usage.\n\nNow, in the spirit of full disclosure I strongly prefer a 7 inch tablet vs a larger tablet. The ONLY thing I like a 10 inch tablet better for is web browsing , though a 7 inch is no slouch in this department. A 7 inch tablet IMO is better for virtually everything else, games, email, video/audio, portability, and especially as an Ereader. The Kindle app for Android allows me to carry all my books very similar to the Kindle Fire.\nI keep my Galaxy Tab 2 in a Poetic hard cover/stand with camera cutout and the device literally fits in my back pocket making this device truly portable vs, a 10 inch tablet. I use this as my Bible, web surfing device, hand held video game device, mp3 player, video streaming device, (youtube, Netflix, hulu, Crackle, etc) email, doc reader and editor, voice and video caller (when connected to wifi) PDA, and ereader. In the short time I have had this device it has become a \"must take with me everywhere I go device\".\n\nPros\nAndroid 4.0\nExpandable memory\nGPS\nPrice\nBluetooth\nMic\nBattery life\nCamera (rear 8mp camera is excellent, front not that great)\nFast and responsive\nPortable\nPolaris Office\nFull access to Google Play store, Amazon app store.\nSyncs to your google account including contact list , Google Docs and calendar.\nIR blaster\nQuick access to mini apps and recently used apps.\nBuilt in screenshot with instant editor\nExternal and virtual volume rocker\nExternal speaker good, not great\n\nCons\nFinger print magnet\nSlick in the hand without a cover\nHome screen takes almost a full side to side swipe in order to switch screens\nDedicated sync/charge cable instead of the more universal micro USB charger"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I have the New iPad (aka the iPad 3) and my mom has the Kindle Fire so I have used that as well.  I would have to say that overall the Galaxy Tab 2 has worked great.  I received it about three days ago and I really like it.  I like my iPad but I always thought it was a little too big.  I liked the size of the Fire but I felt that the operating system on it was too limited.  I decided the Galaxy Tab 2 7\" looked right for the price.  It's $50 more expensive than the Fire and $450 cheaper than my 64GB iPad 3.  The screen is not as clear or bright as the iPad 3 and the video quality isn't as good as the Kindle Fire but I would say that it is not too bad.  Don't expect excellent video quality because it's not but you can't expect all the bells and whistles of a high end tablet for only $250.  I like the android ice cream sandwich OS.  It looks nice on this device and it's a lot different than Amazon's version of android OS on the Kindle Fire.  The interface is fairly smooth and intuitive.  I haven't really had much delay when tapping on icons or sliding the screen.  It's not quite as smooth and sensitive as the iPad but let's face it, if you are interested in buying the Galaxy Tab 2 7\" it is probably for the price and you have ruled out the iPad for that reason or because maybe you have one already.  I think the camera isn't too bad considering the Kindle Fire doesn't even have one.  It is front and back.  There is 8GB of internal memory with an expandable slot for up to 32GB micro SD card.  That is a plus over the Fire.  I find it easy to put music and movies onto the micro SD card, then put the card in the Galaxy Tab and it very quickly loads all of it onto the device to play.  Easier than using the iTunes software if you ask me.  The speakers on the Galaxy Tab are not as clear and crisp or even as loud as the iPad 3 but it gets loud enough for my taste.  The sound is better and louder with headphones.  With headphones it sounds pretty good.  The Galaxy Tab 2 is more portable than the iPad because if you don't carry a bag of some sort to put it in you can still fit it in your front pocket.  You won't be able to put much else in that pocket and it sticks out but you certainly can't do that with the iPad.  As far as android play store, I am new to it.  I'm used to iTunes but there are many of the same apps available on the play store.  There is a Kindle app so you can still read your ebooks.  As far as I can tell there is no way to play Amazon VOD for Prime members or otherwise.  You also can't really sync your iTunes purchases to the Galaxy Tab 2 either.  There are work arounds that allow you to put iTunes movies and music on the Tab but if that is something that interests you, you can always look that up.  Surfing the web is easy and you can use firefox or opera if you want.  I have read some reviews that say surfing the web on this tablet is slow but I have no found that to be the case.  Web pages don't load quite as fast as the iPad but they load pretty quickly.  I also read reviews about how the wifi connection isn't as strong on this device as it is on other tablets.  That appears to be the case but it really hasn't resulted in slow internet speeds for me; and my internet provider doesn't provide me with very good upload and download speeds.  Overall for the price I would say this is a good tablet.  You can get a few cellphones like the Samsung Galaxy Note or the upcoming SIII for $200-$250 that are like this tablet but with better specs.  However, that is the price you pay if you have an upgrade available otherwise without an upgrade you will pay retail of $500-$550.  I think that even the Galaxy Note's 5.3\" screen is a bit too small for a tablet though.  The 7\" screen is just right for an extra-portable tablet.  I would recommend the Galaxy Tab 2 7\".  You can wait until July when supposedly a 7\" Google Asus tablet will be released for $200.  It is supposed to have better specs.  Just FYI."}

The only negative I can say (and it's not the fault of the product) is the size of screen.

It is the next best thing to an iPad as can be found (along with the other products I mentioned and purchased. I'm saving up and getting what I truly want/need -> an expensive iPad!

But after about two weeks, it did not recognize my 16g micro-sd card any more. I pulled the card out and tried it on my pc, and my pc cannot even format it. I tried it on my camera as some online forum suggested, and got no luck either. So one 16g card was ruined with all my data on it.\nThis leaves me with no choice but returning it for a refund. Luckily, I bought it from Amazon, and the returning should be smooth.\n\nUPDATE\nSince my post of this review, a few smart (at least they are trying to talk smart) people have commented on it. What they said may make sense, but I am not sure how they have been using their micro-sd card on the tablet. I often took it out to transfer files between this tablet and a pc. And I have been doing this for my phone for a long time. It could be that the card is bad, but I will not take the chance. The slot of the tablet is not well designed for my point of view any way. I am not the only one who complained about this, I did do a search online before I blame the device.\n\nAs for the comment talking about compatibility, could I suggest that you take a hike?"}

The extended warrently at Walmart was MUCH cheaper than Best Buy. We bought our daughter a Nook Tablet for Christmas which she enjoys, but is locked into B&N's limited OS. For the same money we spent on her Nook, I have Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS). The screen resolution is very nice, and important for my \"older\" eyes ;-) I enjoy having a choice of e-readers to use and have so far prefer the Kindle books on Amazon. I love Amazon for their super-saver-shipping and their gracious handling of my recent returns!! The battery isn't perfect, and I too miss the simplicity of a micro-USB port, but the tablet looks great, handles crisply, light weight, fits in my purse, I installed a 32gig MicroSD card to store movies, ebooks and music, and the price-point was just right for my budget. Oh, FYI...if you are looking for a cover I should tell you that several of the Kindle Fire covers fit wonderfully. I picked up a Belkin cover for the Fire that allows me to prop it (built-in easle) in landscape mode for movies and reading. Another nice surprise was that all APPS I have on my Android phone will load on the tablet at no extra cost...hurray!! ICS can run phone and tablet apps.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "This is a solid product and anyone who doesn't like it is either deluded or has fallen for the iPad dogma. I had bought my wife a kindle fire for Christmas since she is an avid reader and needed some entertainment for when I go riding in the desert. I played with hers a little and almost immediately had tablet envy. Since I am pretty tech savy I wanted to do some research before also buying a Kindle fire to make sure it was the right choice for me. Well the research pointed out the weaknesses in the fire (Bad browser, truncated and outdated droid system, and no expandable memory) so after further research I settled on the Tab 2 which had just come out. This felt like a bit of a chance since it was brand new and there were not a lot of consumer reviews available, but the previous versions had good reviews so I went for it. I am super glad I did! It is a pleasure to use and although at first it seemed very similar to my Droidx phone, it is actually much more powerful and versatile.\nThey expanded memory is a big plus and makes carrying content a non issue since you can bring as many cards along as you would like.\nThe IR port included is also nice and the software for it was easy to use. I had mis-placed my bedroom TV remote and was able to set it up on the tablet in mere moments. Of course since it was a Samsung TV probably helped.\nAll in all I would definitely make this purchase again!"}

The Kindle Fire has a crippled Android OS that won't run all of the apps that this tablet can.  With this tablet, I can load all kinds of reader apps like Kindle, Barnes & Noble, Sony, Aldiko, etc.  Why limit myself to just Kindle?  Plus I can run most Android apps from the Android Market.  With Kindle, you are limited to just what you can get from the Kindle store.  I can't fault Amazon too much on this, since their main objective was to get the cheapest e-Reader on the market as fast as they can so they can sell more books.\n\nNow, on to the one major flaw.  This tablet only has 8GB of internal memory of which only 4.48GB is useable for applications from what I can tell.  I have since filled up this memory with Kindle books and applications.  Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich) doesn't support moving apps to the external SD card like the previous versions.  The 32GB external SD card I have installed in this tablet is absolutely worthless.  From searching the web high and low, it appears that this is not a bug but a design feature.  Apparently, Google just wants the external card to be used for storing media files and nothing else.  They figure a tablet should have plenty of internal storage and not have the same issues as phones.  I hope Google will change their mind on this quick.  My Samsung Galaxy Epic II phone doesn't have this storage problem, but it's running Android 2.3.6 (Gingerbread).  It now holds far more apps and e-books than my tablet does LOL."}

Having the front and rear cameras is nice when you want to have a video chat or take a quick pic of something to Google Goggle. Bluetooth works really well for tethering and uses a lot less power than WiFi tethering on both the devices involved. The TV remote app is a good idea but does not work with all devices and cannot be used like a plain old universal remote (you are locked in to using it as a guide). As usual Touchwiz and all the other Samsung crapware ruins the device and slows it down. It also has a proprietary iPod like connector instead of the a standard micro USB connector like the majority of other devices in the world. Samsung if you insist on including a useless dock connector at least add a micro USB connector as well.

I've shown this device to a couple of my coworkers, fellow software and hardware engineers, and they all seemed highly interested and made aware that this tablet even existed.\n\nMy brother owned a Kindle Fire and I got a chance to play around with it. I liked the size, form factor and price. However, the dealbreaker was the lack of a SD/micro SD card slot. As an avid photographer, it would be nice to pull out my cards and view them from a larger screen. Fortunately, I ran into an article stating that Samsung was going to release a 7\" tablet that would retail $250 that would include the micro SD slot, in addition, front and rear cameras, GPS, and IR blaster (Note: IR is nice to have, but currently the app that comes with it is flakey - sw issue/ not hw). Compared to the Fire aside from all those extra components, is that it's also much lighter, thinner and easier to hold.\n\nFrom reading some of the reviews, I've noticed that there are complaints regarding the 8GB built in memory and the inability to transfer apps to the SD card. I currently have about 60 apps installed on the tablet with 3.88GB to spare - no rooting done to remove bloatware, mind you. Media (photos/video/docs) generally uses most of the memory, which if that is the culprit, can be alleviated by transferring via dropbox/app of choice/cable or the micro SD card (also you can change settings to have pics save to card) ;)\n\nThe gyroscope, or the screen rotation rather, is a bit laggy and it does take about 2 seconds to kick in portrait/landscape mode. Video streaming is smooth and internet browsing works fine with a wifi-dsl connection. Brightness can be easily adjusted by tapping the right hand corner in whatever screen you are in - no need to exit app and dig through the menu.\n\nThe front and back camera is not very good, pictures taken from it are a tad grainy and noisey - when viewed from the device itself. But hey if you're gonna be picky, you just saved several hundred bucks so you CAN go buy a real camera!!\n\nCable that comes with is about 3' long, users might find it a tad short to be plugged in while in use.\n\nThough I pointed out some of the negatives just to make folks aware, in my eyes, they are not dealbreakers. The apps and browsing mechanism works reasonably well and I've used it for a few weeks now with no problems.\n\nOverall, a handy device and best bang for your buck on tablets released as of June 2012."}

The whole family has logged time on this reliable little monster, and we're all impressed. Good job with the product, and of course, with the outstanding Amazon service."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I have owned and used several android tablets and I have to say that this is a really nice buy for your money. I currently own the ASUS transformer T101 and was looking for a smaller screen size that still has Ice Cream Sandwich. I needed the device to be able to stream movies over my network at home or on the go, and let me VPN to my work site and monitor equipment. The Galaxy does both with ease, and is just the right size to take with me to lunch and catch up on the news with Pulse or Newsreader. Compared to a Fire or a Nook Tablet this thing just blows them out of the water. This is not Android with a locked down interface thrown on top....this is pure ICS goodness with a few Samsung touches that can be bypassed with ease. What that really means is that you can customize the tablet to fit your needs. Example: Don't like the built in browser? Install Dolphin and enjoy fast tabbed browsing. Don't like the built in Samsung Music Player? Install Google Music, Rhapsody, TuneIn radio or any other player no questions asked. Add Kindle and Nook apps and you are good for reading, and apps like PlayOn let you watch Amazon video and Hulu on the go. You can do some of these things with Fires and Nooks, but you can do all of them with the Galaxy. Add a 15 dollar 32G Mini-SD card and you have plenty of room for your stuff. I even like the TV app. So check this Tab out, you won't be disappointed."}

I will never buy an apple product again :D  The tablet is cute, functional, sleek and fits in my purse.  My only complaint is the size of the digital keyboard T___T  The keyboard is really small :(  BUUUUT the positive aspects out weigh the negative and make the tablet worth purchasing!  THANK YOU SAMSUNG!"}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I knew within 10 minutes of buying this device that it was getting returned.  The browser is s-l-o-w...  It took 8 seconds from the time I tapped a webpage until it actually started loading, then another 4-5 seconds before the page was rendered.  (Comparison -- on my iPad3, the page is rendered before my finger even gets out of the way of the screen.)  Even getting a 'new tab' screen takes 3-4 seconds to be ready to browse.  Then, with only 4 pages active, the browser crashed.  The TV Remote app seemed like a cool feature, but it worked poorly--missing numbers when changing TV channel, despite pointing the IR blaster right at the TV.\n\nI actually liked the Android 4.0 ICS interface and the LCD is really great, but the underlying operating system here seems to be garbage.  Maybe the tablet did not have enough RAM also.  The device seemed to struggle a lot, and the UI hitches a lot, even with only 2 or 3 active applications.  I made sure to check that I had the latest software, which I did.  It's just disappointing."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "About a month ago I got this tablet for my birthday.  I am very grateful to my wife and kids for this device.  The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is a media  device that comparable to the Kindle Fire in size and price.  It has bluetooth, GPS, front and rear facing cameras, a micro sd card slot, and the Google Play store, the Kindle Fire has none of these.\n\nIt is a wifi only device.  I like that because there is no monthly fee for a data plan.  This device can function well offline.  I have used it for offline GPS navigation, played games, read books, listened to music and podcasts that were previously downloaded onto an sd card.  The battery life is very good and can be tweaked to be great.  I love this device."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "We have the latest Apple's iPad 3 at home but one thing I needed for my personal use was for email and having something that's more compact to carry around.  As much as 10\" tablets are nice, they are still hefty and aren't the easiest thing to type on especially on non-Android system (lack of aftermarket keyboard option for example).  I've also added some in-depth review towards the bottom.\n\nPro's:\n- Lightweight slim tablet\n- Excellent speed with dual core 1GHz processor to run latest application with no problem\n- Excellent device to watch HD videos on YouTube and Netflix\n- Smooth screen transition and snappy response\n- Great browsing and gaming experience\n- Flash is enabled\n- Good battery life overall\n- Bluetooth enabled\n\nCon's:\n- Subpar pixel density including color saturation\n- Some bloatware loaded by Samsung you can't uninstall\n- Slim but very slippery to hold\n- Proprietary data/charging plug like the iPad\n\nWhat this Tablet Has:\n- Latest Ice Cream Sandwich (aka ICS) operating system\n- 3.5\" audio jack\n- Power button and volume up/down button\n- SD card slot\n- Infrared port\n- Proprietary plug for charging and data sharing\n- Front and rear camera\n- Internal GPS\n- Comes with A/C wall charger\n- 8GB internal storage, option to add up to 32GB with SD memory card\n\nWhat this Tablet Doesn't Have:\n- HDMI, Firewire, or USB port of any kind\n- Removable battery\n\nDesign Impression (4/5):\nThe design is slim and lightweight like many 7\" tablets.  It's slim enough it'll slip into your back pocket but of course with some bulk due to its width/length which is a given.  Everything is flush in design except the power button and the volume button located on the sides while I found pressing those buttons by accident often.  It doesn't seem to stick out much but wish Samsung had made them a bit more flush with the case.  The back side isn't perfectly smooth but not enough to give you any sort of grip.  Holding it, I can feel it slipping sometimes.  I have large hands (XL for gloves) and even then the back side alone felt slippery which I'm going to buy silicone case for it soon.  Overall, it's simple and lightweight design if you prefer something compact.  Much easier to carry around than a 10\" tablet; this will sure fit your backpack, purse or any small compartment without an issue.\n\nInterface (5/5):\nIce Cream Sandwich aka ICS is the latest operating system.  What this means is slick but simplified interface that run smooth.  I do like the ICS a lot compared to Froyo, Gingerbread and Honeycomb I've used in the past (see the alphabetic naming pattern Google uses?).  ICS does tend to require more processing power but this tablet does so very well with this dual core.  Geeky talk but basically it has more horse power under its hood.  Screen transition is smooth, can add multiple screens while you can also drag icons together to put them in a folder.\n\nTyping (4/5):\nBy default it doesn't actually come with the popular Swype.  I did already purchase SlideIT keyboard with my phone so I've downloaded and enabled it since (if you've purchased apps from Play store, you can re-download them with your Google account no problem).  In landscape mode, believe it or not, thumb typing is 'okay' and is a bit wide to type even for my large hands.  Portrait mode you can type pretty quickly.  Of course with the Swype like typing it could be done much faster.  I like Android's way of being able to install aftermarket keyboard.  This is where I found the iPad 3 to be bulky and cumbersome to type on as much as their keyboard is generally intuitive and easy to type.\n\nStorage (4/5):\n8GB is okay but with system and other application already taking space, that 8GB can be filled very quickly if you start to load pictures and videos.  Of course with this capability to add up to 32GB SD memory it's not a bad thing either.  Nowadays SD memory card is low in price and can store quite a bit (you may not need it the memory if you're only browsing, playing videos and adding just apps).\n\nSpeed (4/5):\nDual core, 1GHz processors which gives this tablet a great processing power.  Sure, it's not quad-core but it's hard to slow this tablet down.  The only time I noticed any sort of lag is playing game and try to open another application right after.  But the lag wasn't enough to disappoint.  It's not snappy like the iPad 3 but for $250?  One fast tablet that won't disappoint.\n\nScreen (3.5/5):\nThe screen resolution is something to be desired.  If you're using a tablet for the first time you obviously won't notice a difference.  But if you already have a device like the iPad or device with better screen resolution that pack in more pixels, you'll notice right away it's an okay display.  The color saturation also seems to be lacking and could use some help with the contrast.  The icons also doesn't use the whole screen; probably for the reason being so people can hold the tablet which will end up putting their thumbs on part of the screen.  That could all be corrected downloading apps like \"Go Launcher\" which will give you a customized interface with all sorts of skins and wallpapers that are free also.  Again, for a $250 tablet it's not a bad screen either.\n\nAudio (5/5):\nLoud.  It'll even give you a warning when you max out the volume about a hearing damage.  Though the speakers are located only on one side, you can hear the audio perfectly fine with TV playing in the background.  It maybe a plus if you like to use tablet and other device as a music player.  No audio distortion when playing music and movies.\n\nVideo (5/5):\nI tested HD videos with Netflix, YouTube and few other application to see the HD quality.  Excellent pictures and smooth transition.  No ghosting effect or lag in any sort of way watching the latest video including action flicks.  More details on the application itself will be in the detailed reviews below.\n\nCamera (3/5):\nI'm not going into any details here but don't expect a superb quality photos and videos.  Cheaper phones and tablet do not come with a great lens and a sensor.  But to play around with it and take general pictures, it'll do just fine.  But don't try to take family portrait and expect a great photo.  Won't happen!\n\nConnectivitity (5/5):\nThis tablet seem to connect to any router very quickly open or secured.  Once the credentials are entered and remembered, the tablet will connect in seconds which is refreshing.  It seems to pick up more Wifi signals compared to my phone which may have to do with the size of the device.  No dropped connections so far.  One minor issue reconnecting but turning on/off the Wifi solved the issue quickly and hasn't happened since.\n\nBattery Life (4/5):\nNot bad at all.  I tested and played a game for few hours and only drained to 60%.  This is with battery save mode on and screen brightness at about 70%.  Be sure to let the battery drain completely first and charge it in full.  From about 3% to 100% charge took about 3.5 hours using the A/C wall charger that came with the device.  Some people say that's slow but considering something as big as iPad 3, it's pretty fast.\n\n*** Apps ***\nI'll breakdown some of the apps that come with the Galaxy Tab 2.0 7\" tablet and their overall impression.  I feel this is where the tablet shines and even with a mediocore screen, it does give a better impression overall.\n\nYouTube:\nSlick little interface on this tablet with subscribed and featured videos that scroll sideways with a 3D look.  Very responsive and what I personally like is that clicking on the video doesn't make it full screen automatically like the iPad.  Maybe some people will prefer this but I like seeing the small screen along with any other featured videos.  HD movies and clips play without a problem.  Combined with an excellent audio, you can play it anywhere.\n\nGoogle Maps:\nThis Wifi version has GPS.  If you have the ability to tether to your phone, it's a big plus as you can run the tablet as a GPS navigation device.  For some reason, the 'street view' picture quality is horrible on this device.  Not sure if they did this on purpose but the only time I find that the pictures seem like it was taken with a 1-mega pixel camera.  But the interface and browsing in the map is smooth and responsive.\n\nCalendar:\nIf you use Google calendar it will notify any tasks/appointments scheduled and while giving you an excellent interface.  You can add it as a widget also so that's a plus if you often use your phone to schedule meetings, etc.\n\nGmail:\nAnother great Google product with slick interface.  Split into two screens with inbox/folders and the right pane for reading and replying.\n\nNetflix:\nAmazing HD quality and also connects to the server VERY fast on Wifi network.  Even skipping through the videos it'll resume playing within 2-3 seconds which I found to be a great speed like playing on a regular computer.  One negative here though; scrolling through the homepage of multiple video screen lags a bit with this device.  Not a big deal but a minor annoyance.\n\nBrowser:\nDefault browser like many browser on Android is very basic.  Some people may like it, some people may not.  But of course you can run Dolphin, Opera Mini, etc all free from the Play Market.  Everyone has their different taste when it comes to browsers so test them out to your liking.\n\n*** Some In-Depth Tech Review ***\nThis is where it gets a bit nerdy but reserved for those expecting more in-depth review.  As we all know, the Android vs. iOS debate as well as what this $250 tablet offers.  I've used the iPad 3 for the last few months and I can honestly say this Galaxy tablet does well for it's price and in some ways if you're on a budget it also won't disappoint.\n\nInterface:\nBy default you have this 1/2\" empty screen on both sides with the stock ICS.  So I ended up downloading the \"Go Launcher\" which I've used on my phone forever.  Same as \"ADW\" launcher (costs money for this one) it allows you to customize the interface including icons and wallpapers.  You can cram say seven columns and rows of icons on the tablet without a problem.  I haven't read anything about a custom ROM but hopefully there is one out there already if not sooner.  I have CM7.0 on my phone overlocked by 160MHz or so and love how much it saves on storage let alone not having all sorts of bloatware you cannot uninstall by default.\n\nScreen:\nThe screen, I've tried adjusting the contrast with another app but as a photographer I can see some people getting very picky.  Color saturation, strong black and white isn't all too impressive with this device.  iPad 3 blows this tablet out of water when it comes pixel density but for its price that's a given for either tablets.\n\nGoogle Accounts:\nYes, if you have already downloaded and purchased from another device using your Google account, all contents can be re-downloaded including paid apps.  This is one thing I love about the Android system.  Hopefully that will not change!  Everything syncs seemlessly including Gmail, YouTube and any other associated accounts.\n\nGPS:\nI needed the GPS function to use with my car as I drive a lot.  Running Google Maps but often times Waze to know any accidents, traffic, etc (as Google stopped doing live traffic awhile ago).  I'm also a radar/laser detector enthusiast (run Escort Redline) so having another counter measure device is also a plus.  Tethered to my phone, I can run Waze and Google Maps just fine and gives a better view while driving.  It's really all I use it for while driving and one of the reasons why I snagged this $250 tablet.  If I want to pull over and find places to eat, take my daughter to a new park, etc it's another great way to do so on this device.  If you can  tether to another live connection, it's a great tablet unlike spending $100+ on a Garmin (as much as I used to love Garmin).  Very accurate GPS for the most part with the Wifi and GPS enabled at the same time.\n\nBattery Life:\nTurn on the 'battery saver' mode on.  Noticed a huge difference in saving battery.  Before it felt like the unit was discharging within 5-6 hours.  Now I feel pretty confident it can go up to the manufacturer's claim; at leat around 9-10 hours with a light use.  Charging isn't bad at all.  iPad 3 takes forever to charge on the other hand BUT the thing lasts all day playing games and videos.  I haven't compared the specs but assuming it has a bigger battery and ways to save energy.  I haven't ran JuiceDefender on this device yet even though I've purchased the Ultimate edition awhile back.  Should be just as good though.\n\nProprietary Plug:\nNot sure why Samsung opted for the 16-pin connector but looks almost identical to that of iPad but it's not.  Maybe because the mini-USB tends to lose connection and isn't as solid in design when plugged in?  Not sure but then again aftermarket cables are cheap nowadays on Amazon or other sites so not a big deal IMO.  The plug does seem to snap-in really well and is better than charging the iPad where it can be somewhat wobbly at times.\n\nThere's so much more to list but if you have any question feel free to leave a comment!  Overall I'm happy with the purchase.  It'll make a great gift as well."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I had begun to be interested in the world of tablets, and I started to look for a small, budget conscious device, and I found the Galaxy Tab 2 7 Inch, and I am pretty astounded by the quality and value of this device, it does not mimic the cheapness found in similar tablets of this price range, with a highly responsive screen, full Android 4.0, and a good build. Also being a 7 inch device it is very easy to hold with one hand, and it is very light, it is definitely a good choice for those who are on the move often. The device is not perfect though, with a few hiccups.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe device responds quickly to commands, plays media flawlessly, and runs every app without incident, but after a week of using the device, there was an odd slow down of the home screen that occurred for about 5 minutes, I did not get the issue again since, that is the only issue I have had with the performance. I think it was the stock TouchWiz interface, I have since switched to GOLauncher, it's great.\n\nBattery Life\n\nThe battery life is great so far, after being charged to 100% I got 2 days of use without charging, tasks on the device included a little web browsing, browsing and installing apps, and some video/picture taking.\n\nNetworking\n\nThe device is WiFi only; I have had no issues with it, reception is no different than the other WiFi devices in my household.\n\nInterface\n\nThe device uses Samsung's TouchWiz interface; which to my guess is a modified 4.0 interface, it is a nice interface, without lag, but the lock screen seems a little boring, I will probably look into using the default 4.0 interface, or something else.\n\nScreen\n\nThe screen is very good in my opinion, it displays content nicely, and it is very responsive. There have been a few instances where I have sworn I tapped the screen and nothing happened, it could be my error, or the device's.\n\nAudio\n\nThe device features two speakers at the bottom of the device, which sound nice but are not the best I have ever heard. The microphone is located at the top of the device near the 3.5 mm headphone jack, from a little use of the Google voice command feature, I have found no issues.\n\nCameras\n\nThe device features a front and rear camera, the rear camera is 3 MP which takes decent photos, while the front camera is a VGA camera that is good for video chat, it is no SLR camera, but has good cameras.\n\nPorts\n\nThe Tab 2 features a 3.5mm headphone jack at the top, Micro SD slot with door, proprietary Samsung USB port at the bottom. The most interesting is a built in IR Blaster located on the right side, which is supposed to be used with the included Peel Remote app ( I had to manually update the app before being able to use it) which worked very well with controlling my devices (LCD TV, Sony Surround system, Comcast DVR). My only true gripe is the lack of a Micro USB or micro HDMI port to be used with projecting content onto a TV screen, one must purchase Samsung's adapter to do so.\n\nButtons\n\nThe Tab 2 features only 2 buttons, which are located on the right side of the device, the first button is the usual lock/wake button, and a volume up/down button, I would of liked to see a Home button, but the 4.0 interface takes care of that.\n\nBuild Quality\n\nThe Tab 2 has a solid hard plastic build, the back of the device features a soft metal like shell that feels good when held.\n\nPre-installed Apps\n\nThis is one of my gripes with the Tab 2, the device comes pre-installed with a suite of bloatware, that cannot be installed as far as I have discovered, I prefer the default Android apps, with apps I choose to install. It does come with some useful apps such as Netflix and Kindle bookstore.\n\nOverall, it is a fantastic device, with a few hiccups that may only bother a select group of users, being a first time owner, I cannot compare this tablets to others personally."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "The tablet is great and if it weren't for touchwiz, it would get 5 stars from me. Touchwiz can make the tablet terribly slow and changes the default keyboard, way to create folders etc. In short, it kind of ruins the whole android experience. Android devices have got a lot of bad press because of these horrible skins that most manufacturers put. My advice to everyone would be to root the device and put something like CM9 on it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Finally found the tablet for me.  Have an iPad in the family; too large for me, I prefer the 7\" form factor. Have tried earlier Android tablets, found them to be lacking.  Tried the Kindle Fire, good device but missing some key features.\n\nThe size, price, features and performance of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 are the exact fit for me.  I'm not going to rehash all of the pros/cons as they have been talked about quite a bit here.  But this tablet is smooth, reasonably fast, the screen is good for the price, it has access to the larger Andoid app market, and Ice Cream Sandwich is a huge leap forward for Android.\n\nIt may not be \"the best\" tablet money can buy, but it definitely hits the \"sweet spot\" of price/features/performance."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "It can't be compared to an amazon Kindle or Nook. It has to be compared to any full size, full price tablet on the market right now, and I have to say it's incredible! The touchscreen works great, it is really responsive and the grease marks are not that apparent. Also the screen has a great viewing angle and the image is crisp and bright (although i haven't used it under direct sunlight). The user interface is easy to use and I only noticed any real lag when downloading and installing several apps at once. The GPS works great, but as said on other reviews, it works better when you have an active Wifi connection. The TV remote app works great and it was a breeze to set up, all in all its a fun function to play around with. I also have some sections in my house where Wifi is not as reliable, but the tab managed to get a lock and stay connected so I'm impressed with the antenna. The audio from the speakers is surprisingly loud although not that crisp. Also the option of having two cameras is great! As expected the front camera isn't that great but for video chatting it's just what you need and the back camera is better than the one I have on my phone so I'm happy with that. I haven't tested bluetooth or the headphone jack, but I expect they will work great. Finally for the specs you get the price is unbeatable!"}

Overall, I have been very pleased with this product.  It is exactly what I was looking for; as I wanted a good responsive reader as the primarly task, but having access to the internet in something bigger than a phone, but smaller than a netbook or 10 inch was perfect.

The screen is also big enough to easily enjoy browsing the web or watching movies on.\n\nI have to do a lot of writing for work, and when I'm on the go it's a lot more convenient than a laptop. I bought a blue-tooth keyboard for it, downloaded the free app Kingsoft Office and it's just as easy to write on as a PC.\n\nThe camera's aren't the best, but do the job for Skype and everyday use.\n\nThe battery life is great, seems to be around 6 hours of constant use.\n\nLove the fact that you can plug in SD cards, giving you 32gb of storage.\n\nAll in all, surprisingly great quality for the price.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I've only used it for one day, but this is lots of fun.  The only drawback is that for a 7\" tablet, it is darn heavy!  It took me an updated install of Netflix to get it to work without an error message of minimum requirements, but once rolling the video quality is great.  It has a very similar feel to my Samsung Galaxy phone, so I was able to have a comfortable feel for using it from the start.  I am a little concerned over the log in of apps such as Yahoo e-mail as I haven't been able to figure out how to log out.  It appears they stay logged in (except Netflix which you can log out of).  Will have to read up on it as I am concerned about security issues.  The Android Market is readily available and I was able to download my favorite games without problem.  Accessing Amazon Kindle books was also easy and it was great actually being able to see the book covers instead of just a list which is what my husband sees on his Kindle Touch.  I was disappointed in the camera quality, but had to remember that 1.3 mp is mediocre in comparison to my phone which is 8 mp.  Also, there is no flash, but no real surprise there.  The video quality more than makes up for it.  So far I am pleased as I was looking for a \"mini computer\" I could tote in my purse...might just be a little more hefty than I was expecting.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-2-7-Inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B007P4VOWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7-Inch, Wi-Fi)</a>&nbsp;Update:  I have now been using the tablet for about a week and I must stay I am really enjoying it.  It truly is like a mini computer as I can readily access the internet.  I can see there are many more features I need to become familiar with, but overall I am very pleased.  I inserted an SD card for the first time and did learn it is a good idea to turn the tablet off, insert the card, then turn it back on.  Using the Settings feature doesn't seem to work if you inser the card while the tablet is on.  It then instantly recognizes the card and makes it easy to access.  You definitely need to get an exterior SD disk as the 4 MB interior memory card will fill up quickly with photos, games, video, etc.  I am not a big fan of \"i-\"anything (i-pad, i-pod, etc.), so I can recommend the Samsung which seems more user friendly and accessible as far as available apps and other programs."}

The convenience of a 7 inch tablet is what I was seeking.  I own an iPad but hardly take it out with me because it's like holding a folder.  Originally I wanted to wait for the google tablet because of the cheaper price tag, but figured a Samsung tab at this price was as good as it's gonna get for now at least.  Since I already own a Galaxy phone, using this tab is a breeze.  I'm pretty sure anyone would find this user friendly.  I feel confident that this tab will keep me happy for a couple of years until I upgrade and can pass this to someone in my family."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Have owned an iPhone for 2+ years now, an Android 2.2 phone - and recently bought the Kindle Fire for my wife. I don't want to be locked or tied down - which is my experience with the Apple OS.  The OS just works ... but I wanted more freedom. I am agnostic when it comes to operating systems.\nHere are my assessments on the Tab 2 after almost a week.\n\nPluses:\n1. Screen is bright even at 50% which is my current setting.\n2. 2 cameras - front and back. Though I won't be using this for video calls soon, it is good to have the flexibility. For video calls, the resolution is good enough. I still plan on using a real digital camera for videos and stills. I want to have full control over the ISO, shutter speed,  aperture etc.\n3. The micro-SD slot is a big bonus for me. My wife's Fire did not have this. For my use case - which is keeping all my files local, I need that expandability. I use google drive only for backup.\n4. Price is very competitive over the Fire (which I bought a week apart). Again, my wife wants an easy to use reader with the option of other 'screened' apps - so the Fire is perfect for her. For $50 more, I get 2 cameras, expandability - and more configurable experience.\n5. I was able to install the Amazon App Store (app). This will replace the Samsung one which I didn't find too appealing for someone who already has an existing Prime account. Now I get a free app a day!\n6. (Update) I just installed the Amazon Apps Appstore ... which basically gives me access (same look and feel) to the Fire's ecosystem of apps.\n\nCons: (Not weighed)\n1. Charging is pretty slow - I am just used to my iPhone and Android phone with less than 2000mAH batteries - hence, faster to recharge. The Tab 2 came with a 4000+mAH battery - hence, it takes longer.\n2. Out of the box, you cannot load apps on the SD card. This is a limitation on the OS.\n3. Unless you change your power settings, the default settings will drain the Tab 2 pretty quick.\n4. The Samsung apps cannot be uninstalled individually. Some are good - others are so-so - luckily, they don't take up too much space - so until I find a replacement for all of the individual bloatware, I will keep them.\n5. The power switch/select button is too close to the volume controls. They should be spaced further apart as I have often inadvertently pressed it while simply holding the tab or changing the volume.\n6. Samsung uses a proprietary connector (unlike the Fire which uses a standard micro-USB).\n7. When charging, there is no indicator light to show that the battery is indeed charging (unlike the Fire). You would need to turn the tab on - and verify it is indeed charging.\n8. This is lighter than the Fire --- but still, for a 7 inch tablet, I expected something a little bit lighter.\n\nI am being picky here ... wanted to be as objective as possible.\n\nI did look at the Acer and Lenovo tablets over at BB. The Lenovo would constantly flicker - while the Acer had no power. But based on reviews and ratings (and the fact that I get ICS 4.0 at $249), I went with the Tab 2. For my use cases, this is the perfect tablet for me."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I had to return my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 again to BB as it wasn't too much of an improvement over my Kindle Fire. First one crashed several times a day. I loved it's size and finish but, it's browsing speed was slower, reading function poor, crashed at least four times a day, and battery life weak (3 hours vs. Kindle Fire's 12 hours). So disappointing for $250. Like one poster here, I  found out from the BB people that there is a quad core tablet (powered by Nvidia Kai Tegra 3 Soc) that will be coming out in the next few months  which wil be a Google-Asus joint venture. And yes, it is said that the new quad core will cost a measly $200."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I am not the type to write reviews but this tablet has been such an positive experience for me I have to share my experience. First and foremost size was my primary driving factor. I didn't want the standard 10' tablet. I wanted something bigger than my droid cell phone that was easy to hold and easy the hand to type on the keyboard without having to strain or remove my hands from holding the tablet. This does that perfectly! It was easy to set up my gmail account and sync all other email accounts along with my calendar. The camera and video camera work great and deliver quality resolutions images and there is pre-install editing software for both photos and videos. The web browser took a bit of time to figure out how bookmarks are set up and managed but aside from that it works great. The speakers are way more than I expected out of a tablet. This is a dual core processor tablet which is reflected in how well it responds when navigating from app to app or within a specific application. I was able to use the tablet for extended periods of time with heavy camera and video usage without having the battery drain on me. I would say I had the tablet on all day while traveling in Manhattan and was constantly taking photos and video from early am till late pm and the battery still had life to it. Very impressive. Navigation is easy from app to app to settings with easy access touch screen options for viewing active/open apps or navigating to the task killer (nice feature) to quickly getting to settings. The wifi works great in detecting wifi networks. The Samsung comes with a feature to track your tablet should it get lost/stolen.\n\nThings that could be improved (but not deal breakers). In BRIGHT outdoor sun, viewing the screen image is difficult depending on the angle, even with the brightest screen setting set (which is easily accessed from screen).  It would also have been nice to have a USB port to easily transfer photos/file/etc to and from a flash drive (although the existing power cable easily connects to a USB port on your computer to get around this).\n\nSide note: My first couple of days after setting up the wifi connection in my home, the internet connection would repeatedly drop for a few seconds and immediately reconnect. After a bit of online research I found out it was not the tablet but rather the channel my router was set to. This was easily resolved by installing a wifi analyzer app from Google Play, seeing what channels had less usage in my area and switching to one of those channels. My tablet has internet connection and has yet to drop the connection.\n\nI really am very impressed with this gadget/tablet and would recommend it to anyone."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I have been using the tablet for about a month now. I ordered both the playbook and the tab since their specs are very similar. I liked the Tab for reasons mentioned below and returned the Playbook after a week. I'm quite happy with it's performance, if not mind blown. Its definitely worth the money I paid but I still see a lot of scope for improvement.\n\nForm factor: The biggest pro for the Tab I'd say is the weight. Even without getting into the specifics of the OS the Tab wins hands down compared to the Playbook given its much lighter build and better screen. The Playbook has a much solid build and the rubber finish on its back feels much better in your hands but it's a little too heavy for comfort.\n\nDisplay: Speaking of the screen, the 1024x 600 display is vibrant and sharp. One of the best ones out there. It a joy to watch HD videos on this baby. The display is definitely much sharper than the Playbook. The auto brightness wouldn't work properly out of the box - the screen was always way too dim. But I got an over-the-air update 2 weeks after the release date and it's working fine now. I haven't noticed any other changes from the software update.\n\nBattery: The battery is also good. This is my first tablet so I don't really know how long these things are expected to last. Checking my email 3-4times a day and about an hour of browsing/video means I need to charge it once every 90hours. Reading books with the display inverted (white letters on a black page) means you can go for two days without having to recharge.\n\nKeyboard: One of the best things about a 7\" tablet is you can type with two hands in portrait mode as if it were a smart phone. The stock keyboard is really miserable though. It's extremely slow and the auto correct behaves like a 5year old baby. I use the free version of GO keyboard and it's just brilliant. If not for this I'd have returned the Tab. There's a bug in the software that doesn't allow you to move the cursor to the second last line when composing email - which leaves some unnecessary space between the content and my signature. And removing the two extra lines takes more time than writing out the entire email since the keyboard doesn't have arrow keys. If you use the Tab for writing emails a lot you'll find this really frustrating. God bless Go keyboard! It is not only much faster and has a better layout, it has a better auto-correct (though not as good as that of iOS) and the much needed arrow keys.\n\nSpeakers: The speakers are loud and clear, with two separate speakers at the bottom. This however is a bad design - putting both the speakers next to one another. Isn't the whole point of stereo having one on each side? Unless you're holding the tab upside down in portrait mode you're blocking one or both speakers. The playbook does a much better job here with two front facing speakers. No wonder playing NFS on the Playbook gets your adrenaline going. The Tab on the other hand doesn't even have a supported version of NFS. Blah!\n\nOS: This is my first Android device. And I'm pretty satisfied with the performance. The device is responsive and navigation is fairly intuitive. The device does slow down after continued usage though and a quick reboot brings it back to pace. Roughly 600MB of RAM is under use all the time - I'm not sure what causes the slowdown. I wish there were something like a favorites menu to access the most frequently used apps without having to put them on one of the home screen. The Playbook OS 2.0 is clean and minimalistic and does the job. But if you want to go beyond just emails and work, you would want to choose an Android or iOS device. One of my main reasons for choosing the Tab over the Playbook was the android eco-system.\n\nEmail: The default email client is buggy (like I mentioned before). The mail widget seldom doesn't respond when you click on unread emails. You have to open your inbox and then open the unread mail. The unread mail count on the email icon doesn't update when you've read your email, which is also really nagging. The Playbook has a much better email client; that's BB's home ground after all!\nMusic Player: Nothing out of ordinary. You can scroll down easily by the letters on the right side column for songs/artists only, but not for albums. I don't know why. The music player widget is convenient way to accessing your music player but the playlist always scrolls back to the top. This is really irritating when you have a long playlist with hundreds of songs and have to scroll down each time.\n\nReally smooth with docs. Renders pdfs superfast, even the bulky ones with thousands of pages. I'm a grad student and this was my main reason behind getting the Tab.\n\nI could go on and on. But I've hopefully touched base on the most important points.\n\ntldr; The Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 still has a few kinks but it's the best 7inch tablet available in the market as of now if you're looking for a tablet for more than just reading. If its ebooks you're after you might as well stick the Kindle."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I have had the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 for a couple of weeks now and so far I like it a lot. It does everything I want it to do and probably stuff I haven't figured out I want to do yet! I will say that all I want to do (right now) with a tablet is be able to load it up with tons of videos, music, books and hidden object games. For what I want it to do this tablet is fabulous.\n\n I gave only 4 stars instead of 5 though because I think you should be able to transfer downloaded apps to the sd card. I had a cheap little Pandigital Star before I bought this and you could transfer most apps to the sd card on that so don't understand why on a much nicer tab you can't do that simple thing. I have read that it has something to do with the 4.0 ICS and that eventually it will probably be updated and you will be able to transfer the apps.\n\n It doesn't matter that much to me because I don't download hundreds of apps, what I want to put on the sd is videos and music and you can do that so no big deal, it just seemed a bit odd that the apps wouldn't go. I knew that this was the deal before I bought the tablet from reading other reviews though. I knew that the 4GB of storage that was on the tablet after the 4GB the OS takes up would be enough for my app needs.\n\n Also I don't give a crap about the camera, but I have tried it out and to me it seems to take decent enough pics. If I want to take a good pic of something I will use my regular camera. The speakers on this tab are AWESOME! I had to put an external speaker on the other tab I had to decently hear videos and music, not so with this one sound is GREAT!\n\n I have not had any problems with the wi-fi connection at all as I have seen some other reviewers say. Reading the reviews it seems like people who were connecting to wi-fi with 802.11 n seemed to be the ones having problems. I have 802.11 b/g and have had no problems. Not really sure if that is the truly the case but it seems so from reading tons of reviews.\n\n I think the battery life on this tablet is really good. The battery on the Pandigital Star was terrible it is the reason I had to buy another tablet.\n\nWill update if I think of anything else or any issues arise but so far I really like my GT2."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I have had this tablet now for a week, and I must say that I am completely in love with it. It's small, and easily transportable, but provides a bigger screen than my smartphone, and makes interacting with Google Play apps much much easier. The apps themselves run extremely smoothly, with no apparent form of lag. The interface ICS provides is sleek, smooth, and rarely bogs down from background apps. I love the ability to jump from one app to the next simply with a push of an on-screen button, and how easy it is to close a background app with a swipe of a finger.\n\nThe battery life on this tablet is amazing. It lasts much longer than my laptop every did, even running apps continuously. I leave it on overnight sometimes; when I wake up, I am pleased to see the batter has only been reduced by 2-3%!\n\nSetting up all my email accounts was a breeze. It basically walked me right through it. Calendar synced up with my hotmail account too.\n\nI love this tablet; perfect size, perfect speed, perfect interface, perfect price! If you're looking for a tablet to provide you an awesome intermediate between your smartphone and your PC, this is definitely a great buy. I couldn't be happier with this tablet!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I bought this recently.  It is a fine tablet, except for one MAJOR flaw. You will never be able to do anything with your SD card other than use it to hold pictures and videos.  Even books cannot go on the card.  Instead, Samsung creates a fake SD card space inside your limited 4gb free internal memory, and any ap that wants to access the SD card is sent there.  I am unclear if this can be circumvented by rooting the device.  As far as I can tell, even those aps that use music and videos may have a hard time accessing the sd card to get to them.  So far I have only been able to copy stuff to the card via a PC and then if it is music or video the stock built-in ap can see it. But I am not sure even the normal music and video aps (like podcasting aps) can even write to the card (although that may be something I can overcome, I am not sure).\n\nAnyway, I am forced to describe the SD card feature on this tablet as essentially useless.  And I think most of the 5 star raters are people who have not yet discovered the SD card limitation.\n\nFor those who think differently:\n\nIn answer to questions concerning their SD Card, here is the answer direct from Samsung on their support site:\n\nWe apologize for the delay in addressing your question. If we are understanding you correctly, are you asking if you can copy/store apps on an SD card? If this is the case, apps can only stored on the internal memory only. The only thing that can be stored on the SD card is pictures, music & video files."}

The only thing is that Netflix sometimes freezes and a reboot is required, not big deal, but that doesn't happen on iPad 2 neither iPod touch.\n\nThe home screen is really remarkable, you can personalise it, and you can have a small screenshot or the most recent videos in you tube, bookmarks from your navigation, news etc, very nice.\n\nFrom the apps side, Android have more and better quality apps than Apple,for instance you can find complete free version of UNO card game, that doesn't have IOS, you have Hulu Plus, which doesn't run in IOS, neither exploring site with adobe plug in (great).\n\nThe setting quick access from the bar very convenient, the reader for e book is good and also the remote control feature is awesome, especially if you have a Samsung tv.\n\nThe only reason I dont't give it a 4 stars are:\n\nBattery life is too short, even saving putting wifi off, the battery drains after 2 hours of gaming and video vs iPad 2 which the battery really last 4 hours at that use rate?\nthe other thing is that tapping is not so great as iPad, you miss a lot letters, the system seems to not recognised the proper spots of each buttons,  I don't know if this is an Ice cream sandwich issue but is a pain.\n\nIn conclusion I'm very satisfied, since from the beginning  I was clear about what I wanted, a cheaper tablet for Internet and movies with VPN feature, I didn't expect to have a GPS and a slot memory expansion which are plus, but if you want to use a tablet for more complex task you should go for other brands such as apple or toshiba or asus"}

The Ice Cream Sandwich interface is smooth...like a delicious ice cream sandwich. The audio quality on this is good. I normally use a Cowon J3 for portable music listening, but this is almost as a good. Whenever I listen to music with my Westone 2 earphones, I like to bump up the bass slightly along with the clarity. Unlike the Cowon J3, however, the audio quality on this tablet is decent even without EQ. I do recommend messing with the audio settings to get the sound signature you want, though. A lot of people insist on wanting flat EQ because \"that's how the music was meant to be heard.\" This tablet plays .flac files which is a huge plus for me since that's about half of my music library.\n\nThe other thing I like to use this for is playing games. Angry Birds is so much fun on this thing, and unlike my cell phone, this thing actually has the battery to play for extended periods. I do recommend getting a stylus to fine-tune the angle of bird trajectory especially if you have fat fingers.\n\nSome people complained about the resolution not being very high.

I can even sit OUTSIDE the local library and stream netflix from their wireless modem in my car while waiting for my kids' program to end.  THAT is a good wireless device."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Personally I prefer e-ink Kindle 3 (aka Kindle keyboard), which I have for 1.5 years, but in two weeks after release of Kindle Fire I bought it too, because my son, who is medical student, wanted something compact to read his color textbooks. I'm not a fan of gadgets, at least I do not like to have more than really necessary, but I'm quite experienced with them and my friends bring them to me to set up very often. So, I played a lot with different Android phones and tablets as well as with different IOS ones, like iphones, Ipods and Ipads. I do like Apple products quality, IQ and interface but for me they look like handicapped ones comparing to Android devices - no USB host and memory extension, limited number of supported file types, need of iTunes to copy files (no chance to download anything from other computer without it when you are travelling), so sometimes it is even not a lack of features, it is lack of freedom. Actually it relates to Kindle Fire in some aspects, too )))\nAnyway, I wouldn't buy this tablet, but I'm going for vacation and it seems that it will be necessary not only check my e-mails, but to read some documents and to answer, my smarphone is not very convenient for this  and I do not want to carry my 13\" laptop, so I decided to give this tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, WiFi, 8Gb) a try. I played with it for two days and may say the following:\n\nGOOD\n\nScreen: Excellent. Very similar to Kindle Fire, though of different type, probably viewing angles are a bit different, but anyway very good and comfortable screen for reading, browsing and watching movies.\n\nBattery: Excellent. I fully charged it and it worked for 10 hours 43 minutes during two days, when I checked it yesterday (there is a battery meter in the Settings). Today it worked for about 20 min and switched off completely at 5%. I think that 11 hour is very good for first cycle of charging, usually it became a little better (10-15%) after 3-4 cycles of training. This 11 hours were active browsing, downloading applications, reset to  factory defaults, WiFi was on 80% of time, screen brightness - 30-40%, manual. Overnight it eats 2-3% in sleep mode, so the battery is really good. UPDATE for battery - the battery meter shows the time from the last charge of the tablet. Mine restarted after reset to defaults, but anyway, its estimated work time was more than 10 hours, it's why I desided it shows real operation time.\n\nOS: Good. I did not notice any significant difference in speed and touch sensitivity over regular Cyanogens, Kindle or IOS, but I'm tolerable enough to some delays. Actually, after initial set up we do not work with OS, we work with applications and widgets, so I do not care what type of OS is hidden behind, as soon as it is stable. And I do not care if it requires 10 sec to find an icon and to start application, if after that it works okay without lags for hour. 10 sec may kill some guys, but I usually survive.  But it is not the case, Tab 2 OS is intuitive and responsive. The only thing I did not like - it is impossible to set two and more languages in Samsung keyboard, so I had to install additional keyboard. Well, it is stupid, any Samsung Android smartphone has this feature.\n\nApplications. It seems that many applications are not optimized for ICS. I live in different country, but I usually set US as home country for the devices bought here - sometimes it helps to avoid stupid software limitations. But Skype could not be downloaded from Google Play, it told it is not available for my country. Probably they track IP, but even the version, downloaded from 1mobile market told that the device is not yet certified for it. Anyway, Skype works perfectly.\n\nQuality: Good. It seems that it is assembled very well. A bit plastic, of course, but I put it into Roocase leather case immediately and now who cares what is inside?\n\nWiFi: Good. No problems with connection to office, home, and restaurant WiFi networks.\n\nBAD\n\nNo external LED battery indicator. Or it is hidden somewhere inside the case, but all the other buttons and connections are accessible. So you have no idea, if it is plugged in, is it charging or not and is it charged completely before you switch it on. Not very convenient. Sometimes you even could not see on screen battery indicator when the device is charging and off. And charging time is very long - at least 5 hours (from 5 to 100%). But its because of good battery )))\n\nProprietary cable. Well, it would be probably okay, but supplied cable is very short, it seems it will be very difficult to handle device when it is charging.\n\nIn general, very good tablet. I'm not going to use it for a long time, and after I'll be back from this travel, I'll give it to my son to replace Kindle Fire, which he will sell to his mates. At least it's what I recommended to him, though he likes his Fire and have laptop for any serious work. I'd recommend this tablet to anyone who wants good multimedia device. Frankly, all this stuff, including Ipads and other 10\" tablets, is mostly for entertainment, if you want to DO anything, regular cheap netbook is better."}

Slooooooow, so slow to do anything, I mean make a pot of coffee, go to the bathroom, come back still hasn't loaded Yahoo slow. The Galaxy loads pages on Wifi as fast as a home computer, the color and definition are stunning, it comes with a tiny instruction book because it is so intuitive it doesn't need much instruction.

I realized the iPad was a little too bulky for my taste, no flash or microSD card slot (!!!), and I wanted an interface I could customize a bit more. The kind man that worked there asked me what I wanted in a tablet, and I replied that I'd want it mostly for e-mail, games, videos, e-book reading, and light web-browsing and he suggested the Kindle Fire. After playing around with the Fire for maybe 30 minutes, I decided the size was perfect, BUT I knew I needed a tablet with Google Play after taking a look at Amazon's AppStore. I then migrated to the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. Much lighter and easier to hold, had Google Play + cameras and a microphone (with a 3-year old at home, a microphone is a must for Talking Tom!), and ICS, but what really sold me was the screen quality. I was wowed when I watched the Moments of Everyday Life demo video. Looked better than my TV. So, of course I had to buy it. I've now had it for 1 1/2 days, and LOVE it. My Nook magizenes and books synced to my device quickly and easily, games like Talking Tom, Bakery Story, and Tiny Tower work great, the device is much faster than I expected, and customizing my Tab 2 with wallpapers and such took minutes. I actually don't mind TouchWiz. I like waking up in the morning and being able to see the weather and top stories on Yahoo by just turning on my tablet. Multitouch is great, Fruit Ninja worked with 5 fingers. Overall it is a great buy, and the extra $50 I spent on this than the Kindle Fire is the least of my worries."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Although it is advertised for the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0, it was never made for it.  There is no access to the headphone jack....so you have to cut a hole in the case to use them.  The sensor that monitors ambient light is covered by the case, so no auto control for the display.  As such, you have to cut a chunk out of the case.  The IR port is covered by the case....you guessed it, cut another hole in the case for the IR sensor to work.  There is no access hole in the case for the camera lens....so you can't take a photo without removing it from the case....or cut another hole in the case.  Basically, this is a piece of junk repackaged for use on a model it was never intended for."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I purchased this for my wife 2 weeks ago.  She decided she wanted a tab after playing with a friends kindle fire.  She was a little annoyed that I spent more money on a tab she didn't want,  but after 1 day with this she is so glad she has it instead of the fire.  In our opinion the fifty dollars is well worth it.  This thing is very fast I was surprised, it is very responsive in every way.  It has bogged down once but that was on the first day after setting all up and downloading all her programs for the play store.  I rebooted after that and since then it hasn't skipped a beat.\n\nPros:\nBattery life-  My wife gets 3 to 5 days on a charge using it 2 to 4 hours a day mainly for reading, light web browsing, and email.\nIR blaster- the included remote software is pretty cool (it has a built in TV guide on the T.S.)\nScreen- very bright,  bright enough for outside viewing and also still looks very good when turned all the way down for viewing in a dark room.\nvideo- plays video buttery smooth\nSound- Nice and loud from the on-board speakers\nmemory- expandable memory is always a good thing\nspeed and smoothness of the UI\nOS- ICS is a great OS it took a little bit of getting used to coming from gingerbread but I like it a lot.\n\nCons:\nCameras- The cameras are both a little low res. On the front it's not a big deal it still looks good over Skype. The back camera however seems a little soft even in bright light, and of coarse there is no flash.  For us this is non issue we don't use a tablet to take pictures\nScreen- it is a bit reflective this would be a bigger problem if the screen wasn't so bright.  I would say this will probably benefit from a slightly matted screen protector (this is just a hunched we haven't tried one yet)\nspeaker placement- both of the speakers are on the bottom when you hold it in portrait mode this gives you good stereo sound, unfortunately when you hold it in landscape (the way most people will watch videos on it) this puts both the speakers on right side of the screen so not only do you get sound in only one ear you often also end up covering one of the speakers while your holding it.\n\nFor what you get over the kindle I would have expected it to cost $100 more than the Fire.\nIn the current market I consider this to be a bargain $249 buys one heck of a tablet!!!\n\nI hope this helps"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "So I've been looking for a tablet for a few months and I hadn't really seen anything that looked very spectacular. Either the tablets are priced at the cost of a mid-line notebook, or they don't provide near enough functionality/power for what I want. My primary needs for a tablet is to be able to read books, watch movies, and occasionally browse the internet and check email.\n\nTo that end, this little tablet is great! I've tried bigger and more expensive tablets before, including the galaxy 10.1\", but they always just seemed too big and clunky, and not very comfortable to hold. Plus their size made them a little less portable to carry around. This tablet on the other hand is comfortable to hold in both portrait and landscape mode, and is powerful enough to do anything I need it to. The fact that it was the same dual processor and nearly the same specs as the Galaxy 10.1\" is pretty awesome!\n\nThe only complaint that I have, is that although the screen is capacitative, and the device itself is highly responsive, the touch sensitivity seems a bit on the lower end. It's hardly noticeable the majority of the time, but when you're doing something touch intensive, you can tell."}

I had a difficult time connecting it to my WiFi (spent hours trying) and finally broke down and called customer service. After reading some of the reviews about customer service I did not anticipate being helped. Was I wrong. A very knowledgeable, friendly, patient, easy to understand tech named AJ spent over an hour on the phone with me walking me through every possibility. It turned out that the problem was not the tablet or Samsung's fault but the password my husband insisted was correct turned out to be incorrect. AJ helped me locate the correct password and setting it up was then a breeze. He remained on the phone to help me connect to Google which then allowed me to use the apps which are already included. I could easily transfer my Kindle books and my Netflix movies. I am looking forward to all of the uses this little tab provides and am planning on taking it with me on various vacations so that I can have the internet with me.

This info will truly rectify most problems and help you get the most out of your SGT 2 7\".\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdited by the author on May 2, 2012 6:55:32 PM PDT\nMichael S says:\n\nRight now my Tab 2 stats show the device is going 2 days 14 hours on a battery charge with 43% left. I use the Tab a few hours a day web surfing, doing research, checking and responding to emails. There are a number of ways to save juice so I'll mention a few that I use; which some, all, or none, may be applicable to others' situations:\n\n#1 - Go into \"Settings\", then \"Wi-Fi\". At the top right-hand side there is a icon of \"3 bars and a small triangle\" (basically an option button) click on it and when the \"Advance\" box shows on the screen, click it. Then click on \"Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep\" then check \"only when plugged in\". This will turn off the Wi-Fi when in sleep mode & running on the batteries. I use a login pattern to unlock my Tab and every time I unlock the screen it states \"establishing Wi-Fi connection\" I'm using WEP2 encryption on my network and the Tab starts Wi-Fi within seconds of waking from sleep. If one wants their Tab running multiple apps and to always have the most up-to-date information \"pushed\" to the device even while sleeping and running in battery mode, then one has to trade battery life for always-on information. The Wi-Fi will be active in sleep mode when it is plugged in. If you Always want the Wi-Fi off when in sleep mode then select \"Never\" instead of \"Only when plugged in\".\n\n#2 - I mostly use my Tab at home or at the office. I have both Wi-Fi network settings saved in the device, so I turned off \"Network Notification\" in the same area as # 1 above. This stops the Tab from periodically searching the Wi-Fi Network for \"Open Networks\". If I go out and want to connect to a Wi-fi hot spot, I simply turn this feature back on.\n\nNote: When you are in \"Settings\" and \"Wi-Fi\" mode you will notice that periodically the device shows \"Scanning\". Because you are in Wi-Fi mode, it scans to refresh the wi-fi networks its found, to help you connect to them. It does not continue to scan the network after you leave Wi-Fi settings, unless \"Network Notification\" is turn on, although the scan intervals may be different between the two modes.\n\n#3 - In \"Settings\" then \" Location Services\" make sure \"Use GPS Satellites\" is unchecked. This requires more battery and a clear view of the sky, and is really only useful outside.\n\nThose 3 settings will make a difference in battery consumption, and will not affect most people's use of the Tablet, although others' actual mileage may vary\n\n#4 - In addition, as I stated earlier, I mostly use my Tab 2 at work or home, so I always know where I am. Therefore, I also turn off \"Use Wireless Networks\" (Found in the \"Location Service\" section). This use Wi-Fi to help determine your location for Maps and such. If a App or Apps are running in the background and they have a location feature, this stop them from updating while the Tab is sitting idle, or your while your using other apps.\n\n#5- Because I use my Tab mostly at work or home and I know where I am, I usually turn-off GPS. Click on the \"Clock\" icon at the lower right-hand side, and then uncheck \"GPS\". If I ever need it, I quickly turn it back on.\n\n#6- In \"Settings\" \"Account and Sync\" I have \"Auto Sync\" turned off. I turn it on when it's plugged in and then have it Sync. Then I turn if off once its done charging and back on battery power. I usually sync only 1-2 per week, same as my Skyrocket.\n\n#7- Next, in \"Settings\" then \"Developer Options\" (I don't run a bunch of Apps and don't use a lot of \"Notifications\") so I check the box \"Do not Keep Activities\" This means when I leave an App, ICS closes the app instead of letting it run in the background, possibly sucking more juice. I saved this one for last, as it impacts the tablet operation the most. If a person uses \"Notifications\" or likes to multitask with many apps running and want to quickly switch between them, then thus option is not useful. What it does do is free one up from going into \"Task Manager\" and closing down a bunch of Apps you thought you closed but were only minimized when you exit-ed the App.\n\n#8- Lastly, Usually the biggest drain on the battery is the display. Currently under \"Battery\" in \"Settings\" the Display has consumed 65%, with the next closest item \"Internet\" at 19%, and \"Android System\" & \"Android OS\" at 5% each, with everything else at less than 5% combined. Unfortunately, I'm unable to recommend the \"Auto-Display\" mode, as for me, it makes the display too dark most of the time (click on the \"Clock\" icon and then check the \"Auto\" box to engage).\n\nI keep the display setting at about 20-25% as I mostly use the tab 2 indoors. As mentioned above, others' actual mileage may vary with Auto-Display turned on. I use Auto-Display on my Skyrocket, as I use it equally indoors and outdoors. When indoors, I find Auto-Display too dark also, but I live with it because when using the Skyrocket outdoors I find the Auto-Display is a must to see the display in bright sunlight, and therefore watch the battery drain accordingly. To compensation for this, I replaced the stock battery (1,850 mAh) with an extended battery (2,250 mAh) for a 22% capacity increase. This is obviously not a option on the Tab 2.(END OF QUOTE)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet me add, in addition, If one buys this tablet expecting to play graphics intensive action games then that person will be disappointed. That is not what these 7\" tablets are designed for. Also, be aware that this is a transition period in the development of Android software; wherein developers are having to convert their programs to the new operating system (ICS), and this has resulted in some minor problem being experienced on all phones and tablets converting to ICS. The fact is, however that ICS is a big improvement over the preceding Operating Systems; and the Galaxy Tab 2 7\" is a very good tablet for the money. THEY ALL HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS!\n\nHope this is of help!! I know it was to me, and I own five tablets.\n__________________\n\nCbill\nTransformers (2), Xoom, Nook Color (MicroSD root), Galaxy 7+(Returned),Galaxy Tab 2, Optimus V (root)"}

I like the fact that the table is NOT tied completely to good but limited Amazon appstore...  but I can still access much of the store.  Quick for browsing web.\n\nHopefully some compatibility issues get fixed with some updates.\n\nKeeping tablet but very disappointed that the experience is not near as good as what I get from Apple products. If you can find an original iPad for under $300 get it.  You will be far ahead and have less headaches to deal with.\n\nVery good for reading... completely worth it just for Zinio, Kindle App and Google Books App."}

There isn't a horrible amount of bloatware installed (netflix, samsung store, and a few others).\n\nThere are a few things that irritate me though. First, samsung uses a proprietary usb connection interface where a simple micro usb would have sufficed. Their \"kies\" usb transfer does not have linux support, and the device does not support \"mass storage\" mode, only MTP and PTP protocols which mount the device for media transfer or as a camera.\n\nFor transferring data to the device, I have had some luck using sshDroid, but this does not consistently work, especially on local area networks, even with port forwarding. Kies Air did not work well with the Ubuntu system and kept giving transfer errors on large media files like movies. A good cloud service might be helpful (I'm using MS skydrive and google music). It seems like the best option may be to just use a micro sd card usb adapter to add content and insert it into the tablet."}

However, the device, for me, has been CONSTANTLY plagued with performance/memory issues!  I hardly ever even keep the WIFI running or the browser open, and kill any/all apps as soon as I'm done with them.  Nonetheless, this thing is slow as hell!  Typically, I use it for very light tasks, such as, using the stock, Samsung music app, and/or reading via the Kindle app.  These two get the most use, by far.  Regardless, should I try and run another app, (for a total of 2 apps!!!) simultaneously, the device lags tremendously.  It becomes painstakingly slow for me to even swipe to the next screen, much less anything with the least amount of complexity.  The device has also made random crashes/restarts.\n\nFWIW, I did install the update (for whatever, ICS or Samsung OS) immediately upon release, which did nothing regarding my experience.  I even followed some advice I found on forums pertaining to adjustments in the Settings under Developer Options, which also made no difference.\n\nIt has been a highly frustrating experience because I want so much for this thing to work.  The size, for me, would be perfect, able to fit right into my back pocket.\n\nOther notes:\n-I also find the keyboard pretty awful, and the cursor to have a mind of its own when trying to edit text, etc.  I did install Thumb Keyboard, which was a major improvement, though I still had the cursor issues to deal with.\n-Battery life could certainly be better, as it struggles to go a day with only the display on, running a simple app like Kindle, and no WIFI.\n-The speakers suck compared to those in my Samsung Galaxy SII (Skyrocket).\n\nBeware:\n-The 7\" form factor!  I wasn't aware beforehand that I couldn't run all the apps I do on my phone on this device; another downer.\n-I also didn't realize I'd need to buy all new cables/adapters for this device after having bought them all for my phone:  HDMI, USB female, etc.  The cable used here is not a mini-USB as I had anticipated.  I only mention as a Caveat Emptor, as this was the least of my concerns; I'd have been happy to buy all new cables had this device lived up to the performance my phone offers at half the size.\n\nShould I tempt/convince myself to try another one to see if, in fact, my hardware was possibly faulty, I will obviously change my review.  I have been reading over all the reviews here on Amazon, however, and most of the positive reviews, I find to be short and sweet, and without having spent much time actually using the product, i.e., posted after a single day of use!  It seems they may not have given the device a proper test period or, are still just so happy to have joined the Tab Club for an affordable price, that perhaps they are overlooking its shortcomings?  Hell, I was too, quite ready and willing to compromise for a time...."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I bought mine at Best Buy.  Performance is good, price was right (or so I thought).  Everything is good except for one important aspect (for me):  With Android 4, the SD card is not good for anything but storing data.  This means you can't move your apps to the SD card. The internal storage is 8GB but after formatting and the operating system, you're left with a little over half of the internal storage remaining.  While you may put a thousand small apps on the internal storage, the quantity goes down drastically if you load larger apps and their associated data.  For example, the navigation app is larger than, say, a slot machine game, and the map data can be huge if you want to have a bunch of states loaded.  I'm not sure if the map data can be moved to the SD card and have the app know where to find it or not.  There are no instructions about how to use the space.\n\nSamsung should have pushed Google to enable moves to SD card like the earlier versions of Android supported, or provided more internal storage.  And at least make it known to a potential buyer about this limitation."}

I was at first really impressed by its build quality (very solid construction), speed of web browsing, and very agile response when using web applications. Oh, and it is also Made in South Korea (at least mine says), thus an original, pretty much like buying a Sony that is made in Japan, a BMW  made in Germany, a Victorinox multi-tool made in Switzerland, or Oakley sunglasses made here in the U.S. of A. On top of that I was hopeful that its TI OMAP 4430 Dual Core 1Ghz processor, which is arguably stronger than the NVdia Tegra 2 (in some benchmark sub-tests the 4430 comes close to even the Tegra 3), would guarantee stability and efficient multi-tasking.  I guess I raised my expectations too much. What made me decide to return is, for one, its (very) poor battery life which lasts me only about an hour of web browsing, watching video, listening to music, and playing games. Seriously, just under one hour! Also, what I am equally disappointed in is the all-too-frequent freeze-ups, hangups, and crashes of apps, offline and online. Even my eight-year old Centrino and XP-run laptop doesnt crash as much.  My brother also owned a Galaxy Tab 2 for a month, returned his after experiencing the SAME issues I had (i.e. bad battery and crashes among others), but I still thought he got a bum unit then and still bought myself one, which I now realize was a mistake.

So I would not use the camera function that much, and that seems okay because this tablet is anyway too big to be used as a camera\n\nThings I really like are:\n- Battery life itself, and standby battery power use. For example. 76% remaining level becomes 75% or still 76% even after the video play is paused and left for 10 hours, (the screen is blanked automatically after around 1 min., if video play is paused) In my case, to minimize the standby power use, in the setup menu I turned off WIFI, Bluetooth and GPS, and (I think) I checked on the \"Power save mode\" in brightness control. This is just standby status. If you touch the screen, the screen right away turns on.\n- Brightness control:\nThe screen can be really dark (unlike my galaxy-s smartphone), so your eyes are much comfortable when you see the screen in the dark.\n(My Galaxy-S smartphone cannot be that dark. The minimum level is still bright. Because of that, for my smartphone I use some darkening program to make it darker, but even that program cannot make the bottom button lamps that dark.

Unless you own the top of the line product and are signed up for the most extortionate data plan you can find, Samsung's attitude is \"thanks for the money, now F off.\"\n\nHere are a couple of things you should be ready for:\n\n1. The included software will not work with your device. Not \"will be hard to figure out\" -- you will get an error message saying \"this device is not supported.\" They could have just put a message that said \"F You, Chump! <click OK>\". Also, the software [Kies]it will take 15 minutes to install, probably crash several times, and blow up every file association on your computer, making recovering from being told you can't use their software into a nightmare.\n\n2. Want a software update? Try CyanogenMod. You'll have to root it to get one. Fortunately, their sloppy workmanship also makes it fairly easy to do this.\n\n3. The battery will crap out in under 6 months. Fortunately also, since they don't bother to seal the body with anything you can pop the thing open with a wine key and fix this yourself. No! Wait! You'll HAVE to fix it yourself, since you'll get no help from them. They'll refuse to just sell you a battery and will charge as much as a new one to fix it for you.\n\n4. The hardware inside this tab is nearly identical to the hardware in a Barnes and Noble Nook Color, which is $100 less. Samsung does not tell you this, deliberately misleading you into thinking it will be the same as the version they actually care about.\n\nIn short, unless you're into rooting and tinkering, this toy will only be fun as long as it still has new toy smell.

Took a while to load my ITunes, but using DoubleTwist Air Sync everything worked great.  Watched Iron Man 2 on Netflix - such fun. It even shows my iGoogle Home page, not some mobile phone simplify version. If you want a fun tab experience, this is a great choice."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I bought this for my wife.  I have a droid x (i put ICS on it) and she has a galaxy nexus.  Prior to these phones we've had the droid incredible, iphone, droid 1, I also have had an asus transformer TF101 for a year and we've had an ipad1 ... so we have a lot of history with this tech although she is not a \"tech\" person, she just likes things that work and help her organize her life.\n\nThe good:\n- nice hardware\n  - the screen is nice and bright, the weight is nice [a tad heavy but not uncomfortable], the feel is great\n\nThe bad:\n- the software modifications to deviate from stock android 4.0.  they stink.\n\nAndroid 4.0 has a SUPER nice keyboard.  Red underlines for misspelled words, spelling corrections .. the corrections are top notch.  This is one thing android 4.0 nailed.  Samsung TOOK THE ENTIRE THING AWAY!!!!\n\nThey keyboard with the tab2 REMOVES the red underline, it REMOVES the spelling suggestions.  In short it's TERRIBLE.  I tried a few keyboard replacements with my wife but they aren't perfect, and honestly I don't want to mess around it with her since she (and I) just expecting it to be the default keyboard in android.\n\nOn top of this HUGE issue, things are confusing with samsung's services and google's.  My wife went to create a calendar appointment and it warned her that the appointment wouldn't be saved to samsung's services.... why do I care?  It's a google cloud device?  This confused my wife and concerned her, I told her to not worry about it because it was a samsung service but it would still sync to google in the end.  WHY DO THIS?!?!?!  Why confuse your users with 2 redundant services?\n\nIf vendors are going to differentiate themselves, DO IT IN A POSITIVE WAY!  Don't differentiate by confusing users, taking AWAY nice features, and putting together redundant services in ADDITION to the default ones and force the user to choose services when not really understanding or NEEDING to understand why there are redundant services to begin with.\n\nI'm most likely going to return this if my wife can't live without the keyboard working like android 4.0 works and we can't find a good keyboard replacement without trying 50 different apps.  I chatted with a samsung rep via their website and they apologized but that was it, certainly no plans communicated to fix the keyboard issue.\n\nI'll consider the asus tf300 or wait for the rumored asus 7\" tablet they are developing with google since I KNOW that will work as intended without confusing redundancies and a botched keyboard.\n\nIt's a shame, the hardware is really really nice.  It feels nice in your hands and looks sharp.  But software is important too, and samsung screwed it up."}

The build quality feels good in your hand.  Screen is a bit prone to smudging and fingerprints so far, but thats not completely abnormal.\n\nSomething that I dislike and to consider for your purchase though is how the SD card is used.  The tablet does not appear to let me write anything to the SD card, which is a problem considering how much on board memory it ships with.  I'm not sure if its a planned update, but considering that the SD card was one of the selling features to me its a disappointment.  If it worked as many smartphones do, then it would easily be a five star product to me considering its cost alone."}

After calling Samsung again they told me to return it to them where they can look at it and see if they can fix the problem or send me another one. They sent me a UPS return label but it takes 3-4 days to get to them. Samsung did send me a new one after they discovered the first one was a dudd. It did take a week and half to get back but it worked out. I love the product once I discovered it works. Perfect size for me."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "EDIT 03/16/2013)\nHaving owned this tab for almost a year now I thought I would offer an update.  Basically, I still think the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is a fantastic tablet.  At current price of $179 it is an amazing value.  Sure, you can get generics for $100 less, but they wind up being a bit of a crap shoot.  I have tried a couple.  I always wind up frustrated because things just don't seem to work they way they should, and it is often difficult or impossible to get firmware/software updates  Then when you do the update process can be complex and scary.  Samsung has been very good about updates.  We even got Jelly Bean a month or so ago.  The update process is dead simple.  You get a notification an update is available then it is delivered wirelessly whenever you are ready.  Other than making sure you have a good battery charge before starting, you don't have to do anything special to update.\n\nI do not use any of the Samsung apps like Music Hub, etc.  It would be nice to be able to uninstall them to free up the space, but that is a minor quibble.\n\nAnother minor quibble is the proprietary dock connector.  I would prefer a standard micro USB port like my Galaxy Note phone.  Oh, well, at least there are relatively inexpensive adapters to allow the use of USB devices.\n\nOne caveat, the Tab 2 7.0 does NOT have HDMI video out capability (or any other video out that I can tell).  Period.  There is an HDMI adapter for some of the other Galaxy Tabs, but it does not work with the Tab 2 7.0.  I do not really care about this, but if you do, just be aware.  If anyone learns differently and verifies it with personal experience, PLEASE let me know.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\nOK, I have put off posting a review because I thought all of the 5-Star reviews had already raved about the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7 sufficiently.  But I have been seeing too many low ratings that I consider unjustified so here it is.  This is such a great tablet I will simply try to counter some of the major cons that keep coming up.  As background, I have owned or extensively used an iPad, 4 Android tablets, and 4 Android phones.  I do not at all claim to be an expert with Android; I am still a bit puzzled by many things.  But I have used enough Android devices, from 1.6 to 4.0 to have a bit of familiarity with the OS and devices that run it.\n\nAs I mentioned, I do own an iPad, though my wife has stolen it from me.  I bought the iPad strictly to make sure she would be able to use it easily anyway.  But its loss meant I HAD to get the Android tablet I wanted to begin with, right?  Thank goodness because I am NOT an Apple fan.  Even I, an admitted Apple NON-fan has to admit that Apple devices work and work well.  Even to me, the iPad is the gold standard for tablets.\n\nBattery life - this tablet has GREAT battery life, but you do have to practice reasonable power practices.  I charged mine overnight one night, unplugged it in the morning, used it, admittedly very lightly, and after 4 days battery still showed 75%.  I purposely used the tablet very lightly during this time since I was concerned with standby time.  Read Michael S' comment regarding power saving steps here:  http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EL7PM4TA0S2R/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R3EL7PM4TA0S2R\n\nWifi - Many have reported wifi issues.  I don't think this tablet has a wifi problem.  In fact, it has the best wifi performance of any Android tablet I have tried, consistently showing at least one \"bar\" more than any other.  If you have wifi issues try powering your router off and on or unplug then re-plug.  I have ATT Uverse, and I have to do this EVERY time I try to connect a new device.  Every new device gets \"Obtaining IP address from...\" or  \"Connected\"/\"Disconnected\".  Even when I had cable and was able to use my own router I had to do this occasionally.  The Galaxy Tab 2 7 has wifi performance equal to or better than any of the numerous devices I have used.\n\nMove apps to SD - No, as far as I have been able to determine you may not be able to move apps to sd even with App2SD or other such app.  But the device seems to have a TON of system space for apps - far more than normal users require.  Older versions of Android set aside System Storage for apps that might be 256, 512, or, if you were lucky, 1024MB.  On the Galaxy Tab 2 apps seem to be installed in general storage.  Apps space appears in the Total Space.  Right now, for instance, my Total Space area says apps are taking 533MB and shows 3.86GB available.  So how much apps space do you need? If you are super-gamer and need a bazillion GB of apps space, then no, this device might not be for you.  So go spend $400-500 on something else.  If you are a mere mortal, like me, I am pretty sure you will be EXTREMELY happy with this device.\n\nOh, yeah, the Tab 2 has only 8GB of internal storage.  I have never cared about internal storage because I immediately stick a 32GB micro SD card in and make sure photos, music, and videos get stored there.  This tablet will accept a USB OTG adapter so you can store unlimited extra videos on flash drives.  Speaking of OTG adapters, you can get less expensive ones, but this one is really neat:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/GrayBean-T-Flash-Keyboard-Connection-SamSung/dp/B0072FJEA8/ref=sr_1_cc_3?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1336783341&sr=1-3-catcorr\nI bought one, and I can attest that it does work with flash drives.  I just got it and I imagine it will do fine with a USB keyboard.  It has THREE USB ports plus slots for SD and other memory cards.  Sorry, haven't tried those yet, either.  It also has a power input jack for supplemental power, but I don't seem to have a plug that fits.  I will do more testing and post a review for that product soon.  I also have this one\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Black-Female-Adapter-Samsung-Galaxy/dp/B005YWIRBS/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1336783341&sr=1-2-catcorr\nand I can attest that it works, too.\n\nOh, it is not yet available on Amazon, but Samsung makes a Book Cover that is the perfect case for the Tab 2.  Just Google Galaxy Tab 2 Case and you will find it.  It adds almost no bulk.  I can still put the Tab in my pocket.  It is a little pricey right now from reputable sources, but if you decide to go with one of the less expensive places make sure they actually have it.  If you dig, many will say deliver something like 6/23.  Just be careful.  Another note on this case - it \"opens\" to the right in portrait orientation but that is so it will open to the top in landscape.  It folds all the way back for one-hand use, and the edges have tacky rubber strips so you can use as a stand at the angle of your choice.  It is very secure as a stand.  Will not slide at all.  CAUTION:  The Book Cover that Amazon has right now is for the original Tab 7.  The back of the Book Cover case snaps on so the fit has to be perfect.  I don't think the Book Cover for the original Tab will fit the Tab 2.  I got mine from OD.\n\nThis is, hands down, the best basic Android device I have tried.  It is definitely the 7\" tablet I have been waiting for.  Everything works, and works without spending hours researching how to get some feature to work."}

I have a Galaxy Nexus phone which I absolutely love, but I wanted a tablet that was a bit bigger to watch movies on and surf the web. I was very happy with my phone (android 4.0 is great) and I decided to give Samsung another go as my phone is working great. I thought this would basically be a bigger version of my phone (minus the GSM radio). Instead it runs Samsung's hideous take on what an operating system should be. Stock Android 4.0 is great, why does Samsung have to come in and ruin it? Google knows what they are doing, Google makes a great product, but companies like Samsung for some reason are unable just to make the hardware, they feel like they have to come in a theme out the operating system, install an entirely new interface, install a bunch of useless widgets on my home screen, install a bunch of junk apps that I'll never use. When I got the Galaxy Nexus it was so pure and clean, this is a huge disappointment. This Touchwiz nonsense has ruined the tablet for me. I won't be buying from Samsung again."}

I've tried using a couple of other devices (Chromebook, iPad, etc.) before landing this device, and it blows the doors off all of them.  This thing is just plain FUN to use, and it does everything and more than I want it to do.  Being a heavy Google Apps user, and deep into cloud applications, the more I use it the more I find uses for it.  Some of the apps I have installed include Citrix Receiver for login to my most used cloud app (Thomson Reuters SaaS), A1 Keyboard Plus, Chrome to Phone, File Manager HD, Flipboard (very cool), GrooveIP, Kayak, NOAA weather, Open Table, Play Music, Sports Tracker, Spotify, Spotimote, Xfinity TV, Zinio.  Plus, lots and lots of games.  Out of the 5gb of included storage, I still have 3gb left.  Plus, I installed a 32gb microSD card, but I'm not sure yet when I'll need it.  My home screen shows me my Gmail account, Google Voice, Drive, and Calendar, plus six more of my most used apps.  The only app that doesn't want to work for me is the Peel remote control, but I'm working on getting that going, it would be great, if it worked.  With GrooveIP I can use it to make outgoing calls over wifi.  The 7\" size makes it great to use while eating breakfast, or in bed or on the couch.  It even fits in my pocket.  Battery life is great, and the screen is more than enough for my needs.  At times, it will bog down a little, but I find restarting it fixes that issue.  The volume can be way louder than I need it to be.  Screen brightness is best left on manual, and it gets brighter than looking at the sun.  The five home screens hold a lot of icons, and I have one I haven't even started to fill yet.  The widgets are useful, as well.  I highly recommend this product, and the Amazon price and shipping are awesome.  For $250, it's the best deal out there.  I love my Tab 2 7.0, and I feel sorry for my old Android phone now.  It just pales in comparison."}

Although it has some good things like the price, IR, display, GPS, etc.  I have found a shortcomings that make me disappointed with the purchase. The main one is that I can not connect the tablet to the TV  via all share to a Samsung TV, nor by the useless HDMI dock, or by USB, so this is a very serious flaw I find in this tablet, because I can not watch  movies or read books from the tablet on my big screen TV.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "This is my 1st tablet and I have not played with others. I can only base this review against my HTC Thunderbolt phone.\nI bought this tablet to have a bigger screen to navigate email and web with similar or better performance. This has not been achieved for the most part. It is faster loading web pages but that's about it. I've had way too many missed or non responding taps navigating around or using the keyboard. Keyboard only does spelling suggestions and not auto spelling or grammar corrections. Verified with samsung that when you go to delete emails by selecting \"delete all\" it will still delete them one by one. You will have to do this twice. Once from inbox and once from trash so plan on a couple of minutes for around 100 emails. Instantaneous on my thunderbolt in a second or 2. If you're more worried about all the other apps and features then I suppose you'll be ok. I would play with it in the store 1st. I'll be returning and trying something else. Another thing, even though I deleted my sent emails it still shows that i have sent emails on it's icon. Tap the icon and there are no sent emails. I've deleted cache, data, and account and started over to no avail. I have not tried a factory reset but samsung confirmed it's performance of the email app. Maybe others are not experiencing this problem with the email app or it's not an issue to them. The missed or non responding taps and email issues are enough for me. I think a tablet needs to do the main things well and to me that is email and web. Not achieved. Missed on thing to report. Even though you delete your emails from inbox and trash it will bring them back. Say you have some emails in there and you scroll down to the oldest one. You will notice the little syncing animation starting and your deleted emails coming back.\n\nEdit 5-16-12: Adding a star back after a reviewer suggested I use \"Hackers Keyboard\" app to replace stock. I now have a usable keyboard that I'm much more comfortable with. I still have to do multiple taps or taps with force to get some links to respond and the stock email app is my only real issues with this tablet now. May try a reset to see if I can get better screen response."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I bought this very affordably priced tablet to bring to work with me (slow-paced third shift job with lots of down time). One week later and I love this tablet.  The battery life is great! From turn on to the time the device powered itself off was 9.5 hours, and that was with near constant use. The entire time I was connected to WiFi, running trillian, surfing the internet, using various apps on and off, and all with no task killer app. I thought that was pretty amazing, but this is my first tablet.\n\nSo far I am digging the heck out of my tablet. I find the infared red blaster and pre-installed smartpeel app really novel; I quite enjoy being able to quickly switch between whatever I happen to be browsing and a tv guide type app and change the channel to whatever my heart desires. But like I said, it's just a novel addition and I am sure I wouldn't miss it if the device didn't have an infared blaster. I wish there was more internal storage, but for $50 more than the kindle (a device that relies on a cloud service for storage) and microsd card slot, whateva. I also find that the keyboard leaves something to be desired, but the app market takes care of that.\n\nIn summation, if you are debating between this and another tablet, or find yourself overwhelmed by all the options available to you, just suck it up and buy this tablet. Most likely you won't regret it."}

So far it has been amazing and for only $50 more than a Kindle Fire it was well worth it. It does start to operate slow every now and then but if you go into task manager and clear the RAM or download an APP Killer it works great.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I really have to hand it to Samsung when it comes to their 7 inch Galaxy Tab 2. I've been waiting for an inexpensive 7 inch tablet to come out and this one really hits the mark for me. It has the features that I need and does without the features that I don't care about to give me a fantastic piece of awesome for only $250. You get the full tablet experience minus some arguably, unnecessary extras. For instance, HDMI out is not supported and there's no flash. Other than that, this is like a Kindle Fire with two decent, basic cameras, a fully functional Android 4.0 ICS build, and the 7 inch frame that my thumbs and back pocket love. On top of that it sports the best battery life of any 7 inch tablet available, and that's what really sells it. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great 7 inch tablet and doesn't care to spend over $300. Thanks Samsung! I'll be looking forward to investing in the 7 inch Galaxy Tab 3 when it arrives on the scene.\n\nP.S. If you're a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 owner and are having battery life issues you can take some steps to make it better. The first thing I would recommend is controlling your display brightness. That's the biggest culprit. Another recommendation would be to learn how to root your device, load Clockwordmod Recovery, and load a custom rom. Cyanogenmod 9 is out for this tab and it really makes it a pleasure to work with. I don't really care for Touchwiz anyway."}

I had considered other, less expensive options, but not been happy enough to actually purchase anything.  The Barnes & Noble Nook Color was an option, but I would have wanted to root it, and I didn't want the hassle.  I wanted to use my tablet, not work on it.  The Kindle Fire is nice, but it has limited storage (which isn't expandable) and doesn't have access to the Google Play store.\n\nThen Samsung finally got my business.  A 7\" tablet with a good processor, expandable memory, and decent battery life, all for the great list price of $250.\n\nThe screen on this isn't the highest resolution, but it is clear and represents color well.  I am not crazy about the auto-brightness control; it seems a little too bright in dark light and too dim in bright light.  But lock the screen brightness to 50% and I rarely have to touch it.  Plus, you can set up a screen widget to change the brightness if needed.\n\nThe body of the tablet is nice to hold, not too slick, but no rubbery feeling.  The heft makes it feel solid, but it is not too heavy to hold for long periods of time.\n\nThe battery life seems to be doing well for what I need.  The only caveat is that, as with all wireless devices, the wifi will drain the battery faster when it is searching for but not connected to a network.  Not a big deal if you are at home and connected, but you may want to turn the wifi off if you are taking a trip.\n\nAnd the OS is Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich or ICS) straight out of the box.  There is no need to root this device to improve the software; its already as good as you can get (at least for now).\n\nIs this going to match the experience of an iPad? No.  It isn't really meant to either, since the screen is only 7\".  But it isn't locked into the iOS/iTunes ecosystem either, like an iPad.  This also isn't as expensive as an iPad.\n\nIf you don't plan to take the tablet away from wifi, don't need expandable storage, and are happy living in the Amazon ecosystem, the Kindle Fire is a good choice and a little less expensive.  If you are willing to spend $500+, there are tablets that can do more, run faster, or have more features.  However, if you want a tablet that can hold your music or movies while you travel, want the full Android ICS experience, and aren't made of money, this table it for you!\n\nTo sum it up, this tablet is the best value of quality, features, and value currently on the market.  I fully recommend this tablet."}

I had gone to Best Buy with the intention of purchasing a Kindle Fire, but after playing with it I just wasn't feeling it.  I didn't like the heavily modified version of Android they run, and not having an SD card seems like a really odd decision to make.  I was set to buy a bigger and more expensive tablet when I saw the display for the Tab 2 set off away from the other tablets, so I wandered over and checked it out, and I liked it immediately.\n\nThe form factor is nice.  I loved the large size of my iPad, but for reading in bed it is a bit too large and heavy.  I dealt with it because its a fantastic device, but now that it was time to get a new one, I opted for something a little smaller.\n\nThe only issues I have come across is that the stock UI can be a little laggy, so I opted to use a 3rd party launcher which immediately fixed the problem.  The other problem seems to be more with Android and less with Samsung, but the new MTP protocol that is used to transfer files to your computer does not work natively with Mac/OS X, and you have to get a piece of software from google to do this.  However even with the software my computer still won't recognize the device at all.  The only way I can get files on and off my device is either with a SD card, or using a program that lets me connect wirelessly via an FTP application.  Is it the end of the world?  No.  Is it a slight inconvenience?  Yes.\n\nAside from those two small issues this thing has performed well and I am really enjoying it."}

The speed using the web and games on par if not better than many others at and beyond it's price point. It's small enough to put in a pocket, backpack or purse to take it on the run baby. The camera while not the best is very usable. You can't beat the 32gb sd slot foe movies, movies and more. Then Samsung just spiked the ball by adding a IR blaster and ICS....OOOOO....THIS THING IS NICE!!\n\nUpdate as of 5-25-2012\n\nEven without the HDMI and standard USB port this tablet just rock for this price. I am using the iMediaShare app to send movies and music to my tv and other devices and it works great on the Tab. As for my USB grip this is a nice work around at a low price...http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005YWIRBS/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00\n\n5 stars....pick it up"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I bought this product after comparing the different e-readers I was considering purchasing. I looked at the Nook, Kindle, Kindle fire, etc. I read reviews on Amazon as well as went to my local electronics stores to compare in person. I got this product along with others items I ordered at the same time a day earlier than stated when I purchased which is always great. I can't really compare this to other tablets as this is the first one I have owned, but I love it. It's very fast for the processes I use it for (mostly internet searches, Facebook, Twitter, other apps, and reading books on). I love the fact that you can add additional memory which was the main selling point for me on this product over the Kindle fire. I know about Cloud and all of that, but I don't like that you have to be connected to the internet to read your books on Cloud and if I download all of my books and music the storage space on the device would be full in no time. I will be using my tablet a lot while traveling and won't always have internet access at hand. The only downfalls on this product that I have noticed thus far are:\n\n1: That it doesn't have a \"Swype\" keyboard. I have an android phone that has this feature and I love it. There are ones that are downloadable from the android market, but they can store anything you type and I don't particularly like that idea. And\n\n2: Hulu does not work on this device (the app or the website) except to add things to watch later from your television, computer, or other device that works with Hulu. Netflix however does work fantastically on this tablet, so that's a big bonus.\n\nIf you are looking for something that is fast, easy to use, allows extra storage space, and is user friendly I think this would be a good product for you. So far I'm very satisfied. If that changes I will update my review, but I don't see that happening."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I've had my Tab for about 3 days now and so far I'm very pleased with it. I also wish I had waited until it came out instead of buying a Nook Color last year (before the Nook Tablet was introduced). For the most part I like the look and feel of the Ice Cream OS. The preloaded widgets are useful too.\n\nSo far my only quibble is that the I restricted to placing my icons within a limited area of my home screens. There's over an inch of space inaccessible at the top and bottom of the screens. And I can't move icons between home screens as easily as I can on my phone. That said, I'm still learning so there may be functionality that will allow for those things that I haven't discovered yet.\n\nAgain...so far so good."}

Due to the 16 gig limit and my kids needing to stuff it with apps I wanted to get something to call my own.  Truly I didn't want to spend a lot of money since I already have an Ipad and I wanted something with significant memory so that I wouldn't have the same maxed out storage issues I have with my Ipad.  So I decided to purchase the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 and for the most part it meets my needs.  It runs smoothly and the additional storage option (32 gig mini SD) is welcomed.  I don't miss not having the App Store because The Android Market has many of the same apps as well as more than enough apps to keep me happy.\n\nMy only issue is that I wanted to play movies from my digital download library so I could watch a movie when I wasn't in a WIFI hotspot.  Although the specs say that this thing plays most codecs I found that to be untrue.  After attempting to load 15 or so movies I literally got only one to play. To me this is very disappointing and frustrating.  It also takes a long time for movies to download onto the device unlike iTunes.  I hope this is a temporary glitch but it's enough for me to take one star away from the device's score.\n\nOther great features are the cameras.  Although they aren't up to actual dedicated camera standards they are more than adequate for a small tablet.  I don't plan to use them that often since I own cameras.  Being able to view websites with Flash is also nice. The size of the tablet is perfect for on the go as well.  I don't find that the 10\" Ipad is that cumbersome but this 7\" tablet just makes it that much easier to take with you.  The screen size and quality is nice.\n\nIn my humble opinion this device is well worth the money.  It really meets most of my needs. Now if you want the fastest device with all of the premium specs you will be disappointed. This is as good as it gets at this price point for now. I am happy with my purchase so far!\n\nPS. If anyone has any information on how to make my digital downloads play on this device please share.  Thanks."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Reviewing Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7inch wi-fi) 8gb\n\nMarketing seems to be legalized lying for the most part so I approach every purchase as a 6 month learning lesson ignoring all the marketing hypes and reading 'real' reviews from Amazon and other forums before trying a product out.\n\nMy two-cents:\n\nThe 7\" tablets are a nice fit for the hand. I chose the Galaxy over Kindle Fire because I wanted to use Skype (ICS).  Though the Galaxy allows Skype audible, the video function would not work.  I was able to view my friend, but once I tried to activate my video cam the call ended.  We tried several times before accepting the fact Skype (for ICS) and Galaxy will be fine for talking but no video as hoped by me and hyped by Samsung.\n\nThough Samsung's Marketing Team chose to list the tablet as 8GB, they failed to state the fact that you only get to play with around 3.7GB.  The RAM is also around half...generally the RAM read 3xx/6xx (can't remember exact#). I took that to mean 3xx is being currently used out of 6xx available.\n\nThere's a slot for up to 32GB chip, which sold me on it. But when I tried to use a 2GB SD micro chip, which I already had for my Sansa mp3 player, the camera on the samsung unit could only be viewed UPSIDE DOWN....turning tablet upside down only flipped the viewing so it was always upside down.  I didn't keep the unit long enough to find out what other buggy stuff could happen as I was very discouraged at this point.\n\nAmazon's Marketing for Kindle Fire was upfront stating the 8GB model has 6GB usable.\n\nIf only Kindle Fire 7\" had skyping capabilities...even if video didn't work, I'd buy it.\n\nTo be fair to Samsung, I liked the look and feel, and the price allured me...but in the end you have to be able to use the features it boasts and trust the company behind it to be honest with you in order to appreciate a product.  Samsung, please list the info the end user needs to know, otherwise it's deceptive."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I have been using a Kindle Fire since it came out, but was wanting a more full featured 7\" tablet. I also have a iPad but due to its size I find that I rarely take it with me, the 7\" form factor is far more portable. So, I began exploring the idea of the B&N Nook and then rooting it to use the latest version of Android on it, ICS. Then I read about this tablet. For only $250 it is shocking how much you get. GPS (yes, even without the cellular radio), front and back cameras (not the best quality but good enough for video chat). Dual Core 1ghz processor and 8GB of internal memory plus a microSD card slot.\n\nThis beats any other tablet in the price range. If you are looking for a full featured 7\" tablet this is the one to get. You can access the Google Play store, the Amazon App Store and use it to read all of your Kindle books or B&N books, so you don't need to be locked into one vendor for your eBooks or Apps."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Ok, the title of my review might be a little extreme but I stick by it.  Anyone considering a Nook or Kindle should give this tablet a long, hard look.  For an entry level, low cost tablet it has a lot of features the purpose built readers leave out.  Not the least of which is this tablet is not tied to Barnes & Noble or Amazon.  With this tablet you can get content from anywhere you want.  Also, the Samsung has a GPS, front and rear cameras and a memory card slot.  I believe the Nook has a memory slot too but the Kindle does not.  The Samsung also has an IR blaster for controlling your home theater.\n\nMy only other Android device is my nearly 2 year old Motorola Droid X phone and this tablet makes my phone feel very inadequate in almost every way.  The tablets screen is bright, crisp and clear and it is very responsive with little to no lag.  I believe that this screen has a higher pixel density than many of the 10\" tablets as it is nearly the same resolution as the larger tablets in a smaller screen.  I was holding out for a high res 10\" tablet but decided to jump on this one because I was tired of waiting.  I am not disappointed.  It will be interesting to see if I end up preferring the 7\" tablet after I use it a while.  It is very light, small and portable and the screen real estate is really quite usable.\n\nUniversal Remote:\nI just got my tablet last night and setup my home theater easily.  I am disappointed with the interface of the supplied remote app though and will look around for a better version.  But at least the tablet provides the ability to do it.  To be fair though, I did not spend a lot of time with it so it may be better than I think.\n\nKindle Reader:\nThe Kindle reader app is very nice as the text is sharp and it turns pages very quickly.  I think anyone coming from an e-ink based reader will enjoy using this tablet as a reader as well.  My wife has the e-ink Kindle and has often wanted a back lit reader instead of using a book light.  This screen will not be as readable outdoors though but I think most of my and my wife's reading is indoors so there is always a trade off.\n\nStreaming Music:\nI have not tried other media yet other than Pandora radio.  You do get a little hiccup in the audio if you are surfing data intensive apps like Google Maps while you are streaming music.  This may be the result of my pitiful DSL connection at home though.  Will have to try it on a faster broadband connection sometime to see.\n\nMaps:\nGoogle Maps looks great on this device.  Fortunately this tablet has a GPS chip so location based services/mapping are possible.  It is a great size for mapping and once I get a 4G phone with WiFi ability, I will try it out as a navigation device.  Hopefully Samsung will come out with a car dock for this tablet.  Google Streetview is very nice on this tablet as well.\n\nGmail:\nThe Gmail app is extremely nice on this tablet.  Even in portrait mode you get the folder list down the left side and your email in the currently selected folder displayed on the right.  On my phone, you only get one folder at a time.\n\nGoogle Reader:\nI use Google Reader as my RSS app and it is very fast on the tablet compared to my phone.  I go cross-eyed staring at my phone for very long but I can tell from my limited use of the reader on the tablet that the tablet will be great.  The reader is really one of my most used apps and a big reason I wanted a tablet.\n\nFacebook:\nWhat can I say, Facebook is much nicer on a tablet than on the phone.\n\nReal Estate Apps:\nI am currently in the market to buy a house so I have the Realtor.com and Zillow apps.  Both are much nicer on the tablet than on the phone.  The photos on the Realtor app are much larger than what Zillow provides though which is odd.  Photos on the phone are ok, but are hard to tell much about.  With the tablet, the photos are much more usable.\n\nI may come back and add more to this review as I use the tablet more but in my 1 evening with it so far I can tell that I am going to love this tablet.\n\n**Update 5/9/2012**\nI got a chance to play with the tablet some more and have a few more observations to add.\n\nYouTube:\nYouTube looks great on this tablet.  It will seamlessly flip from portrait to landscape without stopping the video.  I personally think the YouTube app has a much better UI than the internet webpage.\n\nSpeakers:\nThe speakers are on the bottom of the tablet when the tablet is in portrait position.  You have to watch that you don't rest it on your lap when listening to something using the speakers.  If you turn it to landscape position, you have to watch that you don't cover the lower speaker with your hand.  I found that if you hold the tablet with your fingers and cup the corner with the speaker it actually helps project the sound to you.  I don't know where else they could put speakers as almost anywhere they are you will have to watch you don't cover them when you hold them so I won't complain about it.\n\nGames:\nWhat can I say, Angry Birds is awesome on a tablet.  Words With Friends is nice as well.  I haven't tried other games yet but expect them to look much better than they do on a phone.\n\n7\" vs. 10\" tablet:\nI don't know what to think about the size yet.  I was trying to hold out for a high res 10\" tablet that Samsung is rumored to be working on but got tired of waiting.  I am really enjoying the light, small form factor of this 7\" tablet though.  So now I am not sure if I will want a 10\" tablet or not.  My brother has an iPad and that thing is a brick compared to this tablet.\n\nWiFi:\nI am a little worried about the people complaining about WiFi issues.  So far mine has been working fine.  It is indicating the same signal strength that my phone and laptop show.  Maybe the problem is hit and miss but I hope if there is a real problem it is something a software/firmware update can resolve.  But so far I have no complaints.\n\nBattery Life:\nI charged the tablet overnight and took it off the charger in the morning.  I didn't use the tablet until I got home about 11 hours later.  It was at 98% charge so it only drained 2% in 11 hours of no use.  I used it for nearly 3 hours and it dropped to 66%.  So 3 hours was about 1/3 of the battery life.  That should translate to about 9 hours of battery life.  I could turn the GPS off since it isn't needed most of the time, I also saw a tip about having it turn the WiFi off when in sleep mode and I have manually set the screen brightness to around 25% which is plenty bright indoors.  Overall, I think it is going to have pretty decent battery life.  I should get about 3 good evenings or a full day on a charge.\n\n**Update 5/21/2012**\nI have lived with the tablet for a couple weeks now and have a few more observations.\n\nScreen Sharpness:\nI got to compare it with my brother's iPad 2 this weekend and the screen on the Samsung is much, much sharper than the iPad.  In fact, my dad's Nook was much sharper than the iPad with the Samsung being sharper than the Nook.  The difference was amazing.\n\nBrowser Speed:\nI was completely happy with the browsing speed of the Samsung until I compared it to the iPad.  The iPad was much, much faster.  Not sure why, but it is very noticeable.  I installed the beta version of Google Chrome and it appears to be better than the built in browser but still not as fast as the iPad.  But like I said, I was happy until I found out there was better.\n\nConnection Issues:\nI have observed the connection problem some people are reporting.  If you hold the bottom left corner, the reception does drop down.  As soon as you left off, it goes up 1 bar.  But I also found out that my router was not operating at full strength.  I had the old standby Linksys WRT54G but recently upgraded to an ASUS RT16N.  As soon as I did, I noticed my cell phone and laptop were not showing nearly as strong reception as before.  I am running Tomato on the router and discovered that you can turn up the signal strength.  By default, Tomato is dialed back.  My nearest neighbor is a quarter mile away so I dialed up to full strength.  That upped my reception by 1 bar when covered and uncovered.  So now I have better signal strength, even when I cover the antenna. I am not worried as I don't lose connection and it is showing a similar signal strength as my phone and laptop.\n\nOverall, I love this tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "My first tablet but my second Android device. My first is an LG Ally smartpone(Android 2.2.2).\nUsing that for almost the last 2 years I've learned what limitations that hardware has with the software.\nThe Ally was an entry-level smartphone with the bare minimum to run Android. Even with a large SD card I often get a \"getting low on phone memory\" notice. The deal is That you can not run apps from the SM card. Apps run from the \"phone\"'s built in memory only.\nWith this being my experience with an Android device upgrading to a Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 was very pleasant. It works and has not choked on anything I've tried on it. I've loaded everything I had on my Ally plus Skype and I still have over  4 Gigs free on the internal memory. Another nice point is that there isn't a lot of bloatware taking up resources (if I wanted Facebook on it I can download the app, Thanks Samsung!).\n7 inch screen is nice on all accounts, the form factor works for me, I would think the 10 inch would be too big to carry around all the time. I've watched a few movies streamed from Netflix and it was enjoyable. The speakers on this are better than the ones in my 15 inch Acer Laptop, they actually have base!\nCould I have spent more for better specs on a tablet? Sure but I don't think I could have gotten a better value. It has the resources to do what I want it to do.\nGrips:\n1) Why is the On/Off button on the side? I'm still learning how to hold the thing and being new I'm often accidentally hitting it, putting it in screensaver mode, why not have it on the front?\n2) Battery life is good unless I turn on the GPS. I may want to get a charger for it in the car.\n3) I would like to be able to use this outdoors sometimes. It's gloss. Got a Matte screen protector and that helps with the glare. That is the one thing I liked about the ad for the original Kindle (Electric paper) You can read it while on the beach, That's the trade-off for having a color screen, It's the Physics.\n\nI'm very happy with this. One of the justifications for getting this is that my contract with Verizon is comming up and I'm wondering if I can drop my Data plan (Why am I paying over $500 a year for data) when most of the time I'm in range of wifi anyway. This just may be able to save me alot of money in the long run and I can do more with it."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I have a Kindle Fire and wanted a unit that I can play downladed music videos and movies on.  Unfortunately because of the KF not having an SD card slot,  I ended purchasing this unit. The unit has a beautiful screen and is very responsive.  I will not go into the technical praises since it has been done in previous reviews,  but I will inform you on some of the idiosyncrasies of the unit.  First of all the Ice Cream Sandwich OS is too new.  Not a lot of apps work with it.  The Adobe Flash player do not work on all websites.  Even though Adobe claims is compatible with ICS.  Sometimes when you download an app it makes it difficult to find.  If you have all you apps screens full you may have to move them around to make room for any additional apps.  The apps move from screen to avaialable screen sometimes takes a few tries.  Accessories for the unit are hard to find and you may have to make some custom cuts to have access to the earphone plug.  This cover I found works best for this unit. (Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Silicone Protective Cover Case - Black Buy new : $29.99 now $5.08). For this one I only had to make a hole for the earphones, otherwise works excelent. Since I like to keep my products as new as possible I also purchased this item,\n\n(Brand New Stylish Protective Cover Folio Leather Case (Black) for Amazon Kindle Fire Tablet PC for the Kindle Fire, Stylus Pen - By Abacus24-7 $5.99. They have a couple of models. I have purchased this previously for my Kindle and it's a very nice looking sturdy case.  The only thing is that it does not have a hole for the back camera. But since I don't use the camera it didn't matter to me. For the car you would need a cigarette USB plug. I recomment something similar to the Griffin Powerjolt Dual Universal USB Micro and also a couple of charging/data cables like the Samsung Galaxy Tab Data Cable (Charging) USB to 30 Pin (ECC1DP0UBEGSTA) $6.12 here in Amazon. Also the HHI Anti-Fingerprint, Anti-Glare, Matte Finished Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7.0) (Package include a HandHelditems Sketch Stylus Pen) This I purchased but did not use since I had the one I purchased at\nBest Buy for $29.99.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I'm writing this review on the Galaxy Tab 2.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Samsung messed it up with \"their\" bluetooth stack! This device will not pair or stay paired with some bluetooth devices out there. It pairs fine with my media device to stream music, but it has issues with my OBD2 bluetooth adapter for my car.\n\nI bought this device mainly to dock it in my car to use with the Torque app (great app btw) via bluetooth to my car's OBD-II using&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/BAFX-Brand-ELM327-BLUETOOTH-OBDII-OBD2-DIAGNOSTIC-SCANNER-CAN-ELM-327-SCANTOOL-CHECK-ENGINE-LIGHT-CAR-CODE-READER/dp/B005NLCGF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">BAFX Brand - ELM327 BLUETOOTH - OBDII OBD2 DIAGNOSTIC SCANNER - CAN ELM 327 SCANTOOL - CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAR CODE READER</a>. I can pair using my phone or other non-Samsung device. When using this Tab it would not stay paired and would keep prompting me for the passcode. I enter the code and it pops up again (yes I am using the correct code)! I have to unpair, reboot, then pair again to get it to work. Imagine having to do this every time you get in your car!\n\nThey should have left the bluetooth stack alone. I have heard that this is the case with most of their products. A workaround would be to root it and flash a custom ROM with a proper bluetooth stack but it's not our responsibility to fix Samsung's half-baked bluetooth stack! I have read that Samsung is aware of this issue and will release an update *some day*.\n\n2. Touchscreen does not respond well to LONG tap-and-holds. When tap-and-holding for long periods, it would become unresponsive and require you to retap-and-hold. Sometimes it doesn't respond on the first retap and you have to keep trying. It happens a lot when playing racing games where you want to tap-and-hold to accelerate. Out of nowhere it would lose track of my finger. Very annoying and my replacement unit has the same problem.\n\n3. Wi-Fi reception is weak! Don't expect to be able to connect to your router if it's on the other side of the house. Where I can get 1-2 bars of signal on may laptop, this Tab says the network is out of range.\n\n4. There is no way to remove the mini-apps (that arrow pointing up in the bottom-middle). The mini-apps are not that useful and it just takes up space. This should be optional.\n\n5. The camera is very poor, then again you can't expect much from one with less than 8MP these days.\n\n6. Charging is slow and requires Samsungs cable. Also, the supplied cable is too short. A standard USB plug would be ideal.\n\nPros:\n-Good size where it's comfortable to type in portrait and landscape mode, and still fits in my pocket.\n-Not too heavy so I can hold it all day.\n-Somewhat quick and responsive CPU/GPU.\n-Decent screen (visible in direct sunlight).\n-Battery life decent with heavy use, power save mode on, and max brightness (a few more hours to get through the day would be nice).\n\nNot everybody will be using the Tab like me (pair with OBD2 bluetooth device or play racing games) so these issues may not be a problem. The Tab is still a great device and very robust. I would recommend it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "The new Tab 2 7-inch is a perfect blend of size, ease of use, and power. Ice Cream Sandwich is very smooth and fast on this pad. The image quality and touch screen sensitivity are excellent. The Gorilla Glass (R) screen surface is very sensitive as well as very strong allowing for use without the need for a protector overlay. I installed a 32GB class 10 SCHD card so it has the same total storage capacity as my Tab 10 and the combination cost was less than half of the Tab 10. It has also proven to be a great ebook for use at night or under low light conditions without the need of an external light due to the backlit screen making it perfect for a travel ebook reader. The print is not quite as good as a Kindle B&W reader but close enough. Overall, the size and weight factors make this a pleasure to use for book reading, news, and watching movies. The only thing on my wish list for this tablet is a 8 to 16 Meg camera."}

This makes the device completely useless. The only fix is to reset it to factory conditions. Of course there is no way to retrieve the data and every app must be manually re-installed.\n\nAside from this glaring flaw, the tablet is perfectly fine. It pains me to send a mint condition tablet back to the manufacturer. I'm waiting for the cheaper Nexus tablet by Asus which should be announced by Google any week now. I may have just been unlucky but I think I'm a little burnt-out on Samsung and need a change."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I received this tablet yesterday. Already have a Xoom wifi tablet which has served me well for almost a year now. I traveled internationally only with the Xoom last year to Japan, Singapore, and India. This worked out very well for me and meant that my bag dedicated to laptop and electronics was suddenly much lighter. I plan on using the Galaxy Tab 2 for every day use like editing documents, writing email, viewing websites, watching movies on netflix.\n\nI found the tablet to be very responsive and installed all the applications I wanted but this is where I take one star away and only give 4. If you have an investment in some HD tablet applications like quickoffice HD the market, play store, whatever will claim the device is not compatible. You can install the \"phone\" version with no problems. I believe that this is because of the display size primarily but if someone knows more, please let me know here.\n\nGetting ICS  by default is nice and means you can get the thing up and running as you want and not sit through updates at first. This makes a very nice difference on these tablets especially. I believe that this form factor is the future for tablets. The Google Nexus tablet will probably come in at this size and we'll see new tablets I believe through this year stress-testing this size.\n\nFinally, the tablet has a very nice feel in the hands and the screen is quite nice and fresh. Installing wallpaper does not result in the usual \"cropping\" requirements.\n\nI was never tempted in the final analysis to buy the Kindle Fire or this tablet. I view the Kindle Fire as a \"Amazon Experience\" device only. If all you want is that content, by all means get one. I want one that is expandable, has the market/play store on it, can do more tasks and be a light-weight companion when I do travel. I think traveling with this little slate will be quite enjoyable. If you journey forth for pleasure, try doing it with no laptop and using a tablet. Along with the games, wifi connectivity, bluetooth, etc; I'm sold."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I have been holding off buying a tablet for years now.  The Ipad, Motorola Xoom, and others are great.  But, in my opinion, they are not worth the $500+ price tag, especially if you already own a good smartphone and laptop.  So, i tried this, and am very impressed.  It's a full featured Android tablet, unlike anything previously in this price range.  Ideally it would have a bigger screen,  but i think that is probably impossible at anywhere near this price range.  There are plenty of reviews on sites like CNET that give accurate descriptions of the strengths and weaknesses of this tablet.  I think they are accurate.  You are making some tradeoffs for the price, but in my opinion they are completely worth it.  One of the cameras is lower quality, but the other one is great.  The internal memory is small, but you can add a micro SD card, so no big deal.  The tradeoffs are 100% worth it given the price savings.  At the end of the day, if you want a \"real\" tablet, and do not think it's worth $500+, this is the perfect solution."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Have had the galaxy tab 2 7.0 for less than 24 hours but in setting it up and using some apps and features for a couple hours I must say this is a neat device. For twice the money you could have a better screen, but the response on the screen is good and the audio is surprisingly good for its size.\nI hope the ex SD problem gets ironed out. That seems to be an issue for many people. I have a lot of Apps on board and still plenty of room. Otherwise it seems you must load music and movies on to the ext card yourself.\nSome apps aren't ready for the tablet size which surprises me as they have had a bit of time to set it up.\nThe big difference between the ipad environment and the android world is the involvement you have with android devices. I like that a lot, some may be smarter to stay with the apple experience. I have both a ipod and ipad which I enjoy, but I like android more than apple though you can't argue with the apple business plan. 35,000 iphones a week, amazing commerce. Oh not to forget this Samsung product is made in South Korea, not at the Foxconn city in China... Personally a good thing for me.\nI have to add that I have found that the clarity of video playback is different with different apps. The native video player doesn't seem to be as clear as Meridian. After using this tablet for the weekend I can affirm that for the price it is an exceptional deal. As an e-reader, web surfer, video player, music player it does it all and you can multitask with it as well. I have had no problem with WiFi and Bluetooth, they both stay on and provide decent coverage through the house and yard There is plenty of room for apps in the available 4 Gb, more would be nice but Samsung was going after the Kindle with this so they made calculated decisions to keep the price as low as possible. The 7\" form factor is very usable, I would be very surprised if the Apple people do not put out a 7\" tablet, as they like having a share of everything...\nWell, it looks like Apple is going to produce a smaller tablet so my above prediction is correct so far.\nI use this tablet daily and enjoy it a lot. It lags sometimes and some apps force close but overall it works. I mostly stream audio on the tune-in app and listen to music and audio books. I have expanded the memory with a 32 GB card and am very happy with it. I keep saying a couple of generations down the line tablets will be a fantastic universal item for everyone's every day use."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Original review:\nFor this review I thought I would provide some details about this tablet from a comparison point of view to the Asus Transformer Tf101. I won't focus on the obvious hardware differences (screen size, port differences, etc.) But instead will talk about some of the lesser known differences.\n\nPros\n-mini app bar - this is a nice feature (but also a source of annoyance) and can provide quick popup access to some features (calendar, alarms, email (not gmail), calculator, music player, task manager, world clock). Asus provides nothing like this.\n-a dedicated screen capture button on the Galaxy while Asus requires holding the Recent Apps Key.\n-the Galaxy keyboard is way better than the Asus provided keyboard. It uses a much smaller percentage of space but yet is still easy to use. I am used to using Thumbs Keyboard app on the Asus and even that app occupies more screen space than the Samsung keyboard.\n-Samsung provides a better application list UI than Asus does. With Asus you can just view the apps and jump to the store. With Samsung you can also customize the order, hide apps and create folders of apps on your home screens.\n-Samsung doesn't require an insane amount of power to charge the unit. My Motorola droid USB charge adapter (which I have several for use with ipods ) is powerful enough to charge this. Asus on the other hand requires an insane amount of power.\n\nCons\n-mini apps bar reduces visibility to notification icons when in portrait orientation. I can only see the battery, wifi, time, and weatherbug temp. No ability to see email notifications. When held in landscape, the other notifications become visible. It is odd because there is still about 3/4\" of space between the mini app ^ and the last icon.\n-mini app bar is not able to be disabled. This means if you value the notification area more than what this feature provides or get annoyed by hitting it instead of the spacebar there is no ability to shut it off.\n-Asus provides the ability to disconnect wifi when screen is off setting to help preserve battery life although no similar offering exists with Samsung\n-Asus provides the ability to disable the screen capture feature\n-Asus provides several custom Widgets while the Samsung does seem to have anything special.\n\nGeneral notes I am disappointed that when adding a memory card it does not allow it be used like on a phone where you can install apps on it to recover some internal memory. This seems to be a flaw with Android's ICS OS and is not specific to this device, as the same is true for my Asus. I just didn't buy a memory card for my Asus since it has 32gb.  I am not certain if I would have got this had I known about this before. In any event I suspect that I'll be able to manage as I can have the camera use the sdcard and I can also store music on it.  And these should be the main consumers of space.\n\nThe home screens have grid dimensions of 6 cells wide by 5 high. On Asus it is 8 wide by 7 high (this makes sense given the resolution difference)\n\nSo far I have run into one app that I wanted on this that play store said isn't supported (peapod) but I was able to transfer it to this from my Asus and install it, and it seems to work just fine. I like knowing that this is an option that I can try if more apps have a similar issue.\n\nNow if I can only find a better way to prevent purchasing content through one click through the Amazon Appstore I might be inclined to get this for the kids. The price point and features are certainly where I wanted it to be and I am happy with this purchase. My only wish was that it had a 1280x800 resolution but it seems less of an issue now that I have it.\n\nUPDATE 12/2012 - Comparison to Google Nexus 7\nSo my kids wanted a tablet and they ended selecting the Google Nexus 7 (16gb) instead of this one (and at the time it was purchased the same price.  Now you get a 32gb Nexus for the same price).  Now that I have been able to use both I have a few comparisons to point out about the Nexus to this tablet.\n\nThe main issues I see with this device compared to the Nexus is the 8gb of built in memory.  Although true Galaxy allows a memory card for music/photos/movies and the Nexus doesn't, my wife often complains that she runs out of room for apps.  There are a few apps that are quite large that just limit what she can put on this.  The kids have 8gb of space still available so I don't foresee them complaining of space issues anytime soon.\n\nAnother issue I see in day to day use of the Samsung is with the size of the back, home, app manager on-screen buttons.  They seem to be a bit too close to each other and also seen to be harder to reach if a case is installed (they both have the same brand/style case) .  The design change that was done for the Nexus OS which puts the buttons in the middle with more space between them actually works very good for this size tablet.  I first didn't like the Nexus change but now I find that it was a good change.\n\nAs for speed comparisons I do feel that the Nexus is faster than the Samsung.  The Nexus is significantly smoother than the Samsung.  Its even smoother than my Asus.  As for network speeds, the devices are the same.  I saw 19k kbps/3.8k kbps on both units.  This is slower than my Asus which received 22k kbps/3.8k kbps.\n\nThe screen resolution is the same on the Nexus as the Asus so it also looks better than the Samsung does.\n\nThe only point which I feel the Samsung exceeds the Nexus in is the fact the Samsung has 2 cameras while the Nexus doesn't.  This means that the Samsung can take quick pictures of things for easier reference later, while the Nexus can't.\nSo if the kids need a quick copy of a document they must scan it and save on the device instead of just taking a quick photo.  The scans are obviously better quality but less convenient.\n\nThe other advantage the Samsung has is due to the fact that it is an older OS so it still supports flash content, while the Nexus doesn't.  I'm certainly disappointed in Google's change in direction on this as it means like Amazon video reviews are not viewable on the Nexus.\n\nSo in the end now that we have all 3 of these devices, I must say that I prefer the Nexus over the Samsung (and I think my wife wishes she had it instead)."}

At first I thought I wanted a 10 inch screen, but after much consideration I decided that a 7 inch screen would be much more compact and easy to take with me when I leave home.  Mostly am interested in reading books, playing a few games, checking my email and being able to connect the tablet to a USB cord to view photos and move things to my external hard drive.  A couple of weeks ago, I saw an ad for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.  The selling points for me, other than it had the ability to do all the things I just mentioned, were the reviews by people who had purchased this tablet.  I decided to go for it, bought it and am very satisfied with it.  I do agree with a previous reviewer that it feels like \"a bar of soap\" when you hold it, so I immediately ordered a safe and secure cover that has all the correct holes for the ports needed.  I purchased the ROOCASE (Leather Case Cover with stand for Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus) from Amazon.  I also purchased a car charger that has the ability to charge my smart phone and my tablet at the same time.  I haven't received the charger yet, but will review it when I try it out.\nI'm very satisfied with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 - 7.0 and highly recommend it for folks looking for a compact tablet with easy to use features."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "So far, this tablet, an early entry for Samsung in relatively discounted tablets, has more or less met my expectations and I really like it (if Amazon would allow half star ratings I would have done 4.5).\n\nOne thing new buyers should be aware of is that as the operating system version, Ice Cream Sandwich, is still fairly new in deployment, there are still some shortcomings albeit on the whole minor.  The only prominent shortcoming I've seen so far, and it's significant but short-term, is that nearly all of the applications are not yet capable of taking advantage of the external SD card, and the very popular apps that allow one to move data and applications to an external SD card don't seem, from my experience, to function yet with this new version of the OS or at least on this hardware implementation.  It's clear this will change in fairly rapid order, but given it's only a 4 GB internal card it's quite easy to fill up the storage on your first day if you are a content-heavy person (I was loading the hundreds of songs I would typically put on, not realizing it wasn't going to the external card at first, even though one of the \"move 2 SD\" apps said the app in question had its data on the external card).\n\nBut the performance is great on this device, and I've already loaded dozens of apps and am able to run everything quite smoothly.\n\nThe only other notable disappointment is Samsung does a poor job of giving a user a good start on the device, at least in my opinion.  Instructions on how to start using it are quire spare.  If I were not an experienced Android user I think I'd be at least somewhat upset; even as an experienced Android user I experienced a few frustrating moments but nothing insurmountable or lengthy.  Some of this isn't Samsung's fault (though they really could have provided a far better guide), rather there's also the issue of the ongoing changes in Android's environment.  For example, when I went to use the Android App Market, I suddenly got the Google Play app asking for permission, and I had somehow totally missed the news about Play replacing the Android App Market.  This led to some issues as I tried to stop this \"strange app\" which was appearing with no explanation whatsoever.\n\nFor my uses, this is really an excellent product (or at least it will excel as soon as more data and apps work on the external SD, which clearly will happen), and I'm glad it came out so I didn't have to spend more on the prior \"Plus\" 7\" tablet.  I think the design tradeoffs (the lesser camera, and some other things I read about that I don't recall) are quite fine and I look forward to using this device for some time to come.\n\nOh, one other frustration I should mention, the plastic door/gate/whatever it is that is supposed to hold the external SD card in is really wonky and at least feels like it's going to break off with any real use.  Just trying to open it I felt like I was breaking part of it, but I think that's because it hangs by a plastic thread, so to speak.  Not sure.  But I want to note that once I seated it back properly it has fit fine and so I cannot tell if my concern is mere perception or if over time, especially if the card is taken in and out on occasion (though not sure that will happen), it will detach.\n\nOtherwise the hardware is really quite nice."}

They had a bundle package with the tablet sleeve included for $239 (few bucks more than Amazon price after tax but you do get a 90 day exchange).\n\nI have to say so far I am very impressed with this samsung tablet.  Its very responsive to the touch seems very fast for what I need it for and the weight is great.  I had the Kindle Fire and I enjoyed it but I do like having access to the Google Market and figured if I need to read books I can always use the Kindle app for android which works very well. I will say the first samsung tablet I picked up I found a few \"lit\" pixels which showed up when using a black background. I took it back to the store and repurchased another one and so far I do not see the same issue.\n\nI think the camera even though its getting a bad reputation still is nice since the Fire does not even have one.  I don't see myself out taking snapshots with this thing but sometimes its nice having it and I might try Skype on it at some point.  So far the wifi has worked great, I downloaded about 800mb of music over iSyncr Wifi the other nite along with downloading apps from the google market and did not notice hardly any slow down.  I think for the money this is gonna be a great tablet.  I currently have an ipad 1st gen, Touchpad rooted with Android and a KFire.  I think this may be the tablet that wins out for travel and just couch browsing.  Love the form factor.\n\n5/3/12-------------------------------\nJust an update tried a couple of the galaxy tab 2 cases and not really liking any of them. Blurex leather slim folio case is ok, but I did not like how the case is when in the open position, doesnt lay flat.  The other one I tried is the MoKo 360 degree rotating case, which the concept is great, but the back of it seems rather large since it has the swivel functionality.  Probably going to send all of these back.  Just for fun I snapped in the galaxy tab 2 inside my old Kindle Fire case the (Ace Flip Case by Casecrown) and it fits perfect.

Now of course there is no camera hole in the back but all the other ports are fully accessible and this cases still allows you to pop out the corner to position the galaxy tab in landscape mode for reading.  They also lay very flat when open which is nice when reading, etc.  Just a thought if someone is looking for a cheaper case (no rear camera hole)."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Great cheap device with some glaring problems.\n\nI have a Galaxy Nexus, iPad 2 & 3, iPhone for comparison. I've had the Tab 2 since the 25th (1 day after launch).\n\nPros: Price, portability and form factor. Excellent video/music player.\nI got a OTG cable and plugged in 3 USB sticks and that was fun but impractical.\n\nCons:\nOnly works if you are tied to Google's eco-system.\nFor example, mail & calendaring. Calendar does not support open-source caldav. No support for .ics calendars.\nMail does not support PUSH IMAP email unless you use Gmail. Even then, it has problem with certain Cyrus/Postfix mail servers using TLS authentication.\nSure there are apps on the PLay store but I found all of them to be flakey at best. VPN , like most Android devices, is flakey and unreliable.\n\nBottom line. Don't even think about using this device for work. This is a toy so I wasn't so hung up on the lack of business features.\n\nHowever, there are some other bigger issues. I bought this tablet on the premise of expandibility. My 64GB iPad cost $829. I have about 6 32GB microSDHC class 10 cards.\nSo I figure I can have an inexpensive video player that I can swap cards with and use as a GPS/entertainment system in the car.\n\nFirst of all. It has very poor file accessibility support. ICS drop USB Mass Storage so you have to use MTP which has problems.\nOn Macs, you have a 4GB limitation with the Google MTP application. Not only that, it only works 2 out of 10 times. The Galaxy Nexus doesn't have this problem.\nThere is virtually no or very flakey MTP support in Linux - CentOS/RedHat. Considering Androoid is based off linux, there should be better cohesion.\nI guess you can install the SDK kit and do adb pull and push in the command line to get your files onto this tablet but I don't think most readers here are commandline Linux gurus.\nHeck, even the iPad has drag-n-drop apps/files support in Linux. The micro-sd slot isn't going to help as I explain further..\n\nSo getting large files to the device is going to be a problem.\n\nThe Tab 2 is billed as 8GB but 1/2 of it is partition for the OS and the user is only left with 4 GB of free space.\n\nThe microsd card isn't very useful for these reasons:\nYou can only format FAT32. exFAT, NTFS, HFS does not work. I even tried formatting my cards EXT2, EXT3, EXT4 (Linux filesystem).\nWhy is this an issue? Well, most HD movies are 5-6 gigabytes and FAT32 has a 4GB limit.  So forget about copying your blu-ray rips.\nOK. strike. I guess playing my movie collection isn't going to work.\n\nNext, with only 4GB of user-accessible storage on the internal, apps will fill it up quick.\nI installed Navigon ( I wanted to use my tab as a GPS for the car), Google earth and a few apps and my Tab 2 was FULL.\nAfter a day's worth of emails, I had 48 megabytes free.\n\nICS does not support apps2SD where you can move apps to the external SD card.\nAnd for apps that store their cache and support programs, the microSD slot is viewed as /extSD and not /mnt/sdcard\n\nI have hundreds of apps on my Galaxy Nexus as the OS sees 29GB and the apps can install and see the virtual internal sdcard. With the Galaxy Tab 2, there is no luck due to how ICS handles internal storage and external micro-sd.\nYou can root your device but it is a known issue that apps2sd does not work for ICS. You cant \"move\" your apps to the external mounted microsd.\n\nOther issues: poor wifi. I have 4 phones and 2 tablets of various makes and the Galaxy Tab 2 has the poorest range. It also drops Wifi N connections.\nIt doesnt support EAS-TL certificate wifi.\nBluetooth issues galore. I have an Incredible, ATT Captivate, Galaxy Nexus and all of them can pair to a ELM32 ODBC module to use with Torque.\nThe Galaxy Tab loses pair bluetooth keys. Older HDMI cables for the Galaxy Plus and 10\" Tab does not work. I cannot get it to play video thru HDMI.\n\nSure, the iPad has a close ecosystem but it simply works better. I can copy 6GB HD movies to my iPad. I can connect to various Linux servers's email and  calendaring system.\nHeck, I can even mount and copy files from a Linux machine to my iPad. E.G. copy movies over.\nI am hoping a 7\" model comes out soon because I like the form factor.\n\nSo I guess I will be returning this tablet and expect something to address the issues with ICS and storage.a"}

I tried a Kindle Fire, and it fit in my back pocket, but it didn't do much other than read books. Amazon sold the little Android guy without legs: only Kindle Fire apps will download and run on the corrupted opsys.\n\nEnter the Samsung Tab 2. I ordered one, and have been using it for about a week, now. It does most of the stuff that the iPad did, and a thousand things the Fire was locked out of. I had very little trouble getting my head around Android 4; it's pretty intuitive. I added 32 GB of storage for $22. Apple would have charged $200+ more just for that. I can make and receive phone calls via WiFi and Skype. The Tab 2 is not a phone replacement, lacking a 3G/4G connection capability. I knew that going in, and I have a cellphone, anyway. Many users would require 3G/4G data for business and monkey business. Let them pay $40-$100/month for their data connection. I don't need it.\n\nBattery life seems quite good. I watched two movies and did a bunch of email/Facebook stuff, and it still had about 1/4 charge indicated. It connected right up to my home WiFi, and to several networks in hotels and restaurants, since. It's hassle free and intuitive.\n\nDoes it work? Yes.\nDoes it work well? Yes.\nDoes it read books, do email, Facebook, web research, GPS, play music, show movies, do YouTube, take dictation, shoot pictures, take HD video, record sound, make Skype calls, and can I fit it in my back pants pocket? Yes.\nDoes it look good? I think so.\nWill it be called 'awesome' by your friends? Maybe not. That's Apple's province, and built into their pricing.\nDoes it walk the dog? Not sure - I don't have a dog.\nDoes it play games? It says it can, but I'm not a gamer.\nDoes it do porn? I'll have to get back to you on that."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "In reviewing my Galaxy Tab 2 I compare it to my iPad 2, which is less than a year old,  because like it or not,  iPad is the gold standard of tablets.  I was actually going to wait for the 2nd generation Kindle in hopes that it would include a memory card slot.  It didn't take long to fill up 16GB on my iPad so I wasn't going to downgrade when I got a 7\" device.  But I have to thank Amazon for setting the price bar for 7\" devices to a more affordable level.  At $249 for a tablet with 8GB and memory card up to 32GB, on a 2nd generation device, the Galaxy Tab 2 is the best buy out there right now.\n\nThe Tab 2 is slightly thicker than the iPad2, which, being 2nd generation, disappointed me.  But at 7\" in size, it was still light weigh and didn't bother me a lot.  Like the iPad, the Tab 2 starts immediately.  I found my finger does not slide across the screen on the Tab as smoothly as on the iPad.  Finger prints are also a lot more difficult to wipe off on the Tab.  Scrolling on the iPad is also a smooth fluid motion where the Tab 2 is a jerky movement.  However, if you've never seen a iPad, I doubt you'd notice.  Where Samsung succeeds is in just offering 7\" as an option.  Steve Jobs was wrong when he said no one would want a 7\" tablet.  I find myself using it more than the full size iPad.  The Android store is also easier to search than the iTunes store, which brings up so many Asian language apps that I waste a lot of time trying to find things.  But one of the best things about the Galaxy Tab is that it is a standalone device.  The iPad must be connected to a PC for setup and updates.  The Galaxy does not require that.  Samsung Kies software is available if you want a PC interface but I was never able to get it to work on the PC or the Kies software for the Tab.\n\nIt seems Samsung does not offer mobile broadband with this device, unlike the earlier 7\" Tabs.  That's too bad.  I know people who would get one if it did.\n\nAs you can see by my 5 start rating, any fault I find with the Tab, doesn't really bother me a lot.  Overall, I think the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 this is the best of the 7\" tablets out there today."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I have an aging iPad 1, and have been looking for suitable alternatives. First I tried the Kindle Fire. It's a nice device, but the restrictions from Amazon make the iPad look positively open source. In retrospect, I think that for what a 7 inch device should do, it's a great buy. That, after having the galaxy for a month. I have an android phone, have had a rooted Nook Color, and a Wooted Xoom - so I think I've tested enough varied waters to avoid the inevitable fanboy accusation.\n\nI do have pros and cons for the device, but first I have to say that part of the difficulties I've had have to do with expectations. While I didn't expect a 7 inch device to do what a 10 inch device can (I do a fair amount of remote computing) I don't think that I had a good idea what to realistically do with the smaller form factor.  At the end of the day, I think that the 7 inch tablet is best as a fancy e-reader, and to that extent, the Fire might be the better tab, more for what it doesn't do than what either of these devices can do with a lot of persistence. Perhaps it's best to have a restricted set of well performed functions in a limited space. I'm sure that depends on the user - I don't have to travel much, so portability isn't as big a deal as usability.\n\nPros:\nVery thin and attractive\nGood price\nNice screen with accurate colors\nCamera -I didn't use it, but it's there\nMinimal bloat\nMicroSD slot (though it is a bear to insert a card in there)\nVideo player was excellent, seemed to play everything, including mkvs.\n\nCons::\nMTP instead of Mass storage was an absolute fail. It doesn't mount on  XP or OSX, and really was a pain even on Win7 (it worked after I installed Kies). What I ended up doing was using File Expert on the Samsung and FTPing from whatever. Just silly.\nWireless drops occasionally, usually on waking.\nMusic - the native player doesn't read m4a's. You have to use something like PowerAmp, which is a great product. This isn't my idea of \"open\" especially when the video player can handle so many codecs. And while we're on this, Google music doesn't accept m4a's either. I don't understand this. Even Amazon will let me upload various music formats to their cloud player. I realize this isn't Samsung's fault. But still...\nICS - still a mish mash mess of GUI. Even on a 7 inch screen, you are tapping in all different directions to achieve a goal. The basic soft-key elements are fine and usually helpful, but I don't get the immutable dock, the applications icon in the upper right corner, and the horrible screen capture icon (I think this was added by Samsung). And lastly, though I am clearly the only person bothered by this, is the blue line that permeates all screen elements (it's there to separate the dock from the main screen). It's there even for video. All the video and photos have a blue line on the bottom. Really?\n\nAs an e-reader it was fine. Nice to have Kindle, Nook, Kobo, on the same device in one small form factor. Due to it's thin-ness, it is hard to hold for a long time, but I think a good  case would help.\n\nI think that if I was going to take on this size device again, it would be more along the lines of the Fire  - a limited device that performs a few tasks well, and leave the more complicated tasking to larger devices. My hope is that the retina display type screens start appearing on more devices which should improve the reading experience even more, and that my expectations for a small devices extend to reading, some video and music, and light emailing. It will be interesting to see how the Google Nexus tabs compare in a couple of months."}

Same router, same settings, and same distance.

However, the problem still occurs. I have a D-Link Wireless N router with WPA-2 security. It never had any issues with all my other devices.

So being a owner of a iPhone 3g, HTC EVO 4g, and my current Samsung Exhibit 2, I felt I needed a bigger screen for my aging eyes, This device does the trick and its easily portable one of the main reason I chose this over a Transformer.\n\nMy views of this device through the eyes of a previous user of a Iphone and a Android phone, out of the box it appeared as a large hand size smart phone, the button inputs seem to be it the right place, the back is a little slippery, this must a Samsung thing, my exhibit 2 sometimes is like trying to hold a wet bar of soap, . I didn't have any problems syncing my Google account.\n\nI did manage to get the peel remote to work with my U verse, Samsung TV and RCA 5.1 stereo, I think the interface is a little quirky, the controls are strange and a little cumbersome, it also has a bunch of program suggestions, none that I like. I'm sure in time there will be better apps out there for the IR blaster.\n\nspeaker sound is pretty good, you will probably want to use headphones or ext speakers anyway.\nthe camera is sub par, it does have rapid shoot, and panorama that works really well, sorry, no digital zoom. at least I could not find that setting, the video is so so, grainy and dark nuff said\n\nI had pretty good luck with the battery, watched 5 episode of Lost on Netflix, downloads apps surfed the web etc, my data usage for that day was about 5+gigs and I had about 27% battery left.\n\nI'm actually a fan of the power connector only because I broke off the power socket on my EVO 4g with the mini usb plug, so i will side with the world of physics and go with more surface area contact the less chance of being snapped off.\n\nApps: youtube works just fine, easy to navigate the tube, I use Waze for GPS, works perfectly, no probs with slacker radio or netflix,  but beware HULU is not supported on this device, like about half of the other android devices out there, works on my evo but not on my exhibit? .... the S calendar is awesome, I use Jorte on my phone but I think this is a little bit better.\n\nno major gripes with this device. it suits all my needs"}

Obviously anyone expecting an iPad experience out of a 7\" Android device will be disappointed.  Luckily I've been looking for a tablet to augment my iPad.\n\nI bought this tablet primarily to use around the house for reading RSS feeds, doing light web-surfing and to check e-mail and my task manager (Springpad).\n\nFor the most part it does these tasks well though I have noticed some issues with scrolling through lists of news articles and longer web pages.  It's just a little glitchy and not as smooth as the Nook Tablet I tried earlier this year.\n\nMy main concern is battery life.  I have never seen a device suck down the juice quick as quickly as this one does. It seems to use 3-5% per hour rendering the idea of multi-day stand-by moot. What I've noticed is the wi-fi indicator says there's traffic almost constantly.\n\nAs a test I stared at the launcher (no widgets installed) for a minute and during that time wi-fi was almost constantly in use. I'm sure this has something to do with the poor stand-by performance but for the life of me I can't figure out WHAT would using wi-fi that much in the background.  When I check network statistics I see the ever helpful \"System\" uses the most bandwidth.\n\nWhile using the tablet I am perfectly happy with battery performance. I was pleasantly surprised the other night to have only dropped to 63% after 4 hours of pretty continuous use.  The following morning I was down to 44% and by the end of that 9 hour work day the tablet was dead.  This seems very odd to me and is likely the fault of the Android OS moreso than Samsung.\n\nThe other issue I've had is that tapping alignment seems a bit off.  About 35% of the time I think I'm tapping on one icon or selection and a different item is selected.  This reminds me of the old Palm days where one could re-calibrate the digitizer if it started getting out of sync.\n\nAt present I'm not sure if I'll be keeping this tablet or returning it and waiting for the Google Tablet this summer.  The issues I'm experiencing may be SW related so I'll be keeping this unit for a few weeks to see if Samsung updates to resolve the issues I've seen.\n\nI'd have given the device four stars but the stand-by battery issue really bothers me.  I didn't see it on the Nook Tablet and am at a loss in trying to track down what system process could be eating so much battery."}

Got the Kindle for a great deal, $139, special 1-day deal, refurbished direct from Amazon, 1-year warranty. Couldn't pass up this deal.  Played with it for about 3-days. Everything about the Kindle was OK. Nothing great, did everything as advertised.\n\nThen I saw the SGT 2 7 advertised. There were 4 things that appealed to me as upgrades from the Kindle. Extra storage capability (huge), camera, availabilty to full android market and ICS (the newest android operating system). I decided if I was going to have a tablet, I wanted something I would be happy with for several years not just the next 6 months. So I pre-ordered the SGT 2 7 from Amazon.  Was told I would recieve on the 25th but was actually delivered on the 24th, nice suprise.  Have played with it for 3 days now, very impressed. Gave the Kindle to my wife. She loves it.  Now my wife and daughter can swap Kindle experiences, whoo hoo.\n\nReview:\nOverall, love the tablet.  Everybody has different reasons to get a tablet. This is simply a play toy for me. Do not need for business. Not looking for or needing the best tablet on the market.\n\n* Look and feel are great, lighter than the Kindle. Not difficult at all to hold and read book for an hour or so.\n* Screen is good!  Everything looks clear and sharp. Not the best on the market but definitly OK for the price.  Watched Neflix movie last night, picture and sound were great!\n* Touchscreen very responsive, minimal delay in opening apps.\n* Wi-Fi is good. Goes down from 4 bars to 2 bars when I go upstairs. Does not seem to effect reliability much.\n* Sound is great.  Cranked the volume all the way up and had minimal distortion. Better that expected for this tablet.\n* Love the ability to set my screens up the way I want (unlike Kindle)\n* Many more apps available through Google Play then Amazon's App Store. Big plus.\n* Camera sucks.  But I generally take pictures with a real camera (remember those). Good enough to take some pictures when you forgot you camera or your cell phone isn't working. No big deal to me.\n* I have heard people complain about the proprietary cable. Really, get a get a life. Cable is used to charge and connect to my laptop to xfer video/music files to tablet. Works perfect.\n* Only real issue is the remote control app.  Started Peel setup, recognized my Vizio OK, could not recognize DTV box though. After 2 trys, app loaded up email to send trouble tik to Peel, pre-loaded all info, I just needed to enter DTV model no.  Received email within an hour from Peel advising they had received my email and would look into it.  72 hours later no response. Not a Samsung issue but dissapointed Peel doesn't support there product better.\n\nOverall, very pleased with the tablet and confident I will get many years of enjoyment. If your in the market for a good tablet to play games, watch movies, listen to some music or surf the net, you will not be disappointed with the SGT 2 7."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "This is the first tablet I've owned, and overall i really like it. I already have a Galaxy S2, so I'm a fan of Samsung and the Galaxy series. The tab has a quick response, smooth transitions from screen to screen. Apps all load pretty quickly, and downloads are fast also. The camera is pretty low quality, but i can use my 8mp camera on my phone so i don't mind. I have yet to video chat on this, so i can't comment on the front-facing camera yet.\n\nThe battery seems long to me, but i only use this tablet at home when i have wi-fi, and my phone all day at work, so its not being used by me for 8hrs straight. I've used it for probably 3 or 4 straight in a day.\n\nSince its running ICS, and I've never used a tablet, i had to adjust to the layout, with the commands being in the bottom left, along with the task manager/dropdown menu bar etc. The dedicated screenshot button is completely unnecessary and in the way, but once i was used to it being there it was avoidable.\n\nI was very impressed by the inbrowser video playback. Youtube videos and flash were great and smooth. i watched an entire HBO show last night with no problems. Netflix runs smoothly, and so does HuluPlus (thought the Hulu app is not in the market yet).The IR remote is cool, but is really only needed if your feeling lazy, but when you are lazy its cool, and works well.\n\nThe screen isn't the best, but its nice. Again, its hard for me to be impressed by the screen and cameras since i've experienced the AMOLED screen on my GS2. If it weren't for the larger screen size, i'd be tempted to continue watching video on my phone. But once i buy a microSD card to expand the storage, i think i'll get more use out of this tablet.\n\nI have a mac, so in order to transfer files to this tablet, you need to download a program to your computer to sync files, movies, etc. Also, you can only transfer files no larger than 4GB, which was disappointing for me since alot of my movies are HQ blu-rays that are 4.5+GB each. So a microSD card may be a must since large transfer can't be done via USB.\n\nSummary: Basically, if you already have a Samsung Galaxy phone (S2, Note, etc) I wouldn't buy this tablet, just because your phone is probably better. But if you have $250 to spend for fun, it's not bad to have. Its good for watching movies in bed, surfing the internet, playing games. Also remember it's running Ice Cream Sandwich, so that could be incentive to buy for alot of people who want to play with the new OS.\n\nit isn't a bad tablet for the price, and is definitely a great choice for a first time tablet buyer who wants something entry-level."}

The lack of a user manual beyond the micro sized print pamphlet is definately a hinderance for me as a new user. I am trying to use the one for the galaxy plus which is helpful but a manual for this device should have been created prior to its release. Hopefully Samsung will edit the galaxy plus manual on their web site to match the galaxy 2 or write a new one soon. There are features I purchased this unit for that I have not been able to use due to lack of documentation. One star off for this."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I own a Kindle Fire, and haven't had it long enough to be a dedicated fanboy. I AM an apple fanboy...now. I've always wanted an iPad and was saving up for a \"the new iPad\", but I can't spend that much on a tablet right now. So When I saw the Galaxy Tab 2 7\" I got really excited. Finally a full fledged tablet at the right size at the right price, with awesome specs. I could return my Kindle Fire and get a machine without compromise...or so I thought.\n\nI used to have an Android Galaxy S phone, but switched to the iPhone because I was tired of all my phone's random glitches and crashes. An example was being told I was in Sweden while I was in Tyler, Texas. My wife made fun of me because I used to gripe non-stop about how much I hated my Android phone, vowed to never get another one, and yet was drooling over the new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. I called to every local dealer till I found one who would sell it on saturday (the day before official release).\n\nRight out of the box I loved it. The screen was great, the smooth bezel and perfect size, the expandable data capability, and the control bar, which is one of my favorite features on the device, made everything so much easier. I could put icons and widgets wherever I wanted to. I had full access to the google play store. That's where the benefits started to fall off. I bought the Kindle Fire to read, surf the web, manage documents and have something for my 5 year old to play on, it worked great for all those things, but it's very limited by the Amazon Android shell. OH, and the speakers worked way, WAY better on the Galaxy Tab 2 than the Kindle Fire's anemic speakers.\n\nAll that being said, the Galaxy Tab 2 wouldn't/couldn't sync up to my Mac, MAJOR issue for me, I absolutely hate windows os. I tried installing the android software meant to assist with data transfer for macs directly from the Android website, to continually get a, \"please connect device to initiate file transfer\" (paraphrase) message. To transfer files I could only use dropbox, which ultimately is a slow and somewhat painful replacement for direct file transfer. Strike 1.\n\nThere were serious formating issues with my ebooks when I finally managed to get them to the Galaxy Tab 2.  I purchased and set up a handful of top rated ereader programs from google play, moon+reader ($4.99), aldiko (free), the Kindle app and a couple others. Paragraphs were separated by several lines of blank spacing, and the paragraphs were cut in odd locations not waiting for the actual end of the paragraph. I used epub and mobi formats to no avail. Calibre was also not able to be called on for assistance since my computer couldn't recognize the Galaxy Tab. Strike 2.\n\nA smaller, yet still frustrating issue, probably fixable with a different browser program, is something I'd come to respect abou the Kindle Fire. On the Kindle Fire, when viewing text on a website, I could zoom in on the text and it would be reformated to fit my page. This made it so I wouldn't have to scroll around, thus easier to read. The Galaxy Pad did not have this feature and I was scrolling constantly when surfing. As I said minor issue, but still. Strike 3.\n\nThen I couldn't get any of the Amazon HD apps to run on the Galaxy Tab 2, more of an Amazon issue really, but I didn't want to be forced to purchase all the same apps over again, expensive and a major hastle. Strike 4.\n\nThe reason I got rid of the Samsung phone was because it was glitchy and wouldn't work. I got rid of this for the same reason. I love my iPhone, it simply just works, and works really well. I started having PTSD when the Galaxy Tab started to throw problems at me and decided I would go back to the Kindle Fire, like my iPhone, it just simply, works. The Kindle doesn't do half the things I wanted to get the Galaxy Tab 2 for, but it works really well for the main reasons I wanted it. I'll get over the stuff I'll lose.\n\nI know these aren't necessarily strong reasons not to get it. As I said there are a lot of benefits to using the Galaxy Tab 2, but it does not in any way replace a Kindle Fire if you are an avid reader, or if you're a mac user."}

I tried the Kindle Fire, found it lacking out of the box because it doesn't do well with Gmail and Google Calendar. I rooted the Kindle Fire, tried Cyanogenmod 7 and 9, and it still wasn't great for me.\n\nEnter the Galaxy Tab 2 7\". It's lovely hardware, significantly lighter than the Fire. With bluetooth, which the Fire lacks, it plays very nicely through my Creative D100 bluetooth speakers. And it is much more satisfactory than the rooted and modded Fire--recent OS, and much fewer bugs than the unofficial Cyanogenmod ports (blessings to all the devs at Cyanogenmod and XDA!)\n\nThe Tab operating system, Ice Cream Sandwich, is sleek, smooth and attractive. Although there are far fewer apps than for the iPad, my needs are met well. I really like the voice dictation and command interface that is very well integrated into the apps. Too, I'm using the SlideIt keyboard, available through the app store--much better than the stock keyboard IMO (and one of the reasons that in this instance I prefer Android to IOS since Apple doesn't make this kind of Swype-like input available in such a well-integrated manner).\n\nOther reviewers have commented on the pros and the cons. I'll just add that while there are compromises compared to, say, the iPad 3, the compromises are reasonable and don't affect my enjoyment of the device.\n\nIt may be that new tablets such as the vaunted Google tablet will provide more bang per buck. But at the moment, the Galaxy Tab 2 7\" provides plenty of bang, with a fluid and enjoyable user experience for this size of tablet. Glad I got it."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "UPDATE May 2012: I have lowered the rating down to one star. I purchased this tablet to watch movies and stream video but it simply doesn't work, probably because the processor is vastly underpowered. I suggest getting a more powerful 5\" phone instead of this paperweight.\n\nHere is a list of what works and what doesn't on this new Samsung Tablet 2:\n\n1) Bluetooth Audio = Hard to pair to headphones. Often the bluetooth devices don't register, however, once paired, the signal is strong. Skill level required: above average.\n2) Bluetooth File Sharing = No two way file transfer with Macintosh. One way only.\n3) HBOgo App = Is not yet available for Android.\n4) Flash Video Playback = Random results, sometimes it works sometimes if does not.\n5) YouTube = Works fine.\n6) Samsung USB Adapter = Reads SD card files and can delete files. Very hard to transfer files. Skill level required: high.\n7) 1080p High Definition video playback = often no audio, skips frames or crashes on all Android video players that I tested. The processor can't handle HD Video and sometimes not even SD video.\n8) Audio Volume = Excellent. The best of all tablets on the Market.\n9) TwitTV Apps = No Video. Some video podcasts exhibit audio synch problems.\n7) Peel Smart Remote = Good luck getting this one to work, I am an expert and it took me 15 tries to figure it out. Also it requires a permanent Wi-Fi connection, no Wi-Fi, no workie. When it does work it does a nice job except for the slow volume control.\n8) Nice battery life if you turn off the GPS and adjust Wi-Fi setting to \"off\" while at sleep. GPS is \"on\" be default.\n9) Screen is not sharp but most people won't notice the difference or care if they do. Acceptable for movies of medium resolution which is all it can play anyway.\n10) Wi-Fi seems to work fine, have not tested for distance.\n11) Camera quality is very mediocre, who cares, right. Video is noisy.\n\nSoftware review: the new Android Ice Cream Sandwich software that runs at the core of the Galaxy Tab is still marred by Google's inept programmers, you know what I mean, the pseudo-interface that get worse with every new version? Add to that the buggy software available in the Android Market and you get an overall unfriendly experience, still a potpourri of random hangs and crashes. Doesn't look like Google cares nor is capable of creating a friendly interface, too bad because it is Ice Cream Sandwich which really ruins the Samsung Tablet experience.\n\nConclusion: The \"Galaxy Tab 2\" sacrificed some key components in order to sale this tablet for $250 and it shows, the processor is underpowered, to make matters worse, Ice Cream Sandwich is still confusing and cumbersome for the average consumer. As much as I like to recommend this form factor my final recommendation is to hold off a few more months, Apple will soon release the next generation of 7\" tablets for about the same price and so is Microsoft, yes, Windows tablets are supposed to be solid contenders.\n\nMore free advice: Amazon reviews of 5 stars are almost always fake and can be safely ignored, I suggest reading the 3-2-1 star reviews for a less biased experience before you buy."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "If you are looking for a 7\", well-functioning, affordable tablet to surf the web and consume content then this the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is one of the best options out there. I own a Kindle Fire and love it. It is all that I need when I'm ready to relax in the evening. However, the Galaxy Tab gets the advantage for being a budget media tablet. Here is why:\n\n1) Hardware: Slightly lighter, slimmer. The Fire is a little easier to grip because of the back, but this is lighter to hold and carry. Front and back cameras. Who cares if they aren't the best because the Fire doesn't have either. Volume rocker makes volume adjustments simple.\n\n2) Software: This is my first Android device and it runs smoothly and I haven't had any problems. There are a plethora of options for customizing this device to your needs.\n\n3) Applications: No longer restricted by Amazon's App Store so you get to experience new apps that everyone is talking about sooner.\n\n4) Media: Still have access to books and videos from Amazon either through Amazon Kindle app or Amazon's website. In addition, you now have access to Google's app, videos, music, games library. A strong ecosystem is important in the long run and like Amazon and Apple this device has that with Google.\n\nI gave this device 5 stars because if you're looking at this tablet then you probably don't want to spend a lot of money and you want a smaller tablet. This is one of the best options out there."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "Like some other reviewers, I also own an iPad and an iPod (but no iPhone). I think of the Galaxy Tab 2 as filling a niche between the iOS products, mainly because of its physical size. If Apple decides to make a 7-inch iPad, that would probably serve just as well. But I was eager to try the Tab 2 to give me a feel for how Android performs relative to iOS. In addition, the price was definitely right.\n\nBottom line: I'm happy. Not deliriously so, but happy. It does take a little time to get used to how to manipulate Android if you've been using iOS for a couple of years, but it's not a major hurdle. As a user of many Google products, I was impressed at how seamlessly Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) integrates with them; no contortions are required to access them or sync with them. I also appreciate the greater flexibility in setting up screen views, the use of widgets, and the fact that seldom-used apps are kept in the background. Also, Android/ICS lets you keep track of your files in a number of ways, which iOS keeps hidden from the user.\n\nA few minuses. First, the physical switches on the Tab 2 are easy to press by mistake; since the Tab 2 is relatively small, you're almost bound to hit one of them while holding it--I'm clumsy, to boot, which makes it even more likely. Second, the software keyboard has the small delete and enter keys right next to each other; I can't count the number of times I've pressed enter while trying to delete an entry. Third, the camera is nothing to write home about. And finally, there's very little documentation on how to use ICS; if you've been using a previous version of Android, it's probably a no-brainer, but those of us immersed in iOS could use a little help getting started.\n\nAs for overall value, no question about it: The Tab 2 is great value for the money. It's only fifty bucks more than a Kindle Fire, and it uses pretty much a generic version of ICS, not a proprietary version, which means that most apps from the Android store can run on it without bother (I've found exceptions, though). It's definitely found a permanent home with me, and is likely to be what I carry around with me day-to-day. The iPad is a heavier-duty big brother, most useful when I'm sitting and doing a lot of reading, or need the larger screen real estate that it offers."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "After doing literally days worth of research on tablets within my budget, it came down to the Kindle Fire, B&N Nook, Blackberry Playbook, and this device. All retailing for less than $300, but after reviewing the specs of the aforementioned devices over and over, and watching many Youtube video's, and reading countless posts and discussions on this device I went ahead and pre-ordered it. First off, I tip my hat to Amazon, who got this sexy piece of technology to me a mere day after it's release (keep up the good work guys). Now on to the review.\n\nRight out of the box, I love the way this device feels in my hand. It just cradles my hands perfectly, and has a nice weight to it, and the materials to me, feel like quality stuff. Upon fully charging it, I did the initial setup, and then proceeded to download all of the apps I would need on this device (SBM, Quickpic,Camera ZOOM FX, Aldiko, Rage of Bahamut, A Comic viewer, Evernote, etc.). After testing all of them under various conditions, I am very pleased with the performance the tab offers. There was no noticeable lag or performance issues at all in starting, using, or playing any of my favorite apps. The TouchWiz interface blends nearly seamlessly into ICS, and I for one like the the way Samsung integrated the two interfaces. The capacitive screen is very responsive, and I had zero problems using SBM on this device to keep my many invention ideas drawn and saved for further refinement. Speaking of which, the screen is gorgeous at 1024 x 600, and while not the highest end screen out, is simply stunning for the price range. I tested a variety of HD videos, and all of them ran without a single hiccup in the frame rate, and had all had bright crisp pictures, and awesome sound quality (the speaker was far better than I expected it to be). Watching the HD quality video of One Ok Rock Live at Shinjiku Loft was truly awesome on this screen, and didn't stutter a single bit.\n\nRegarding reading e-books, it housed, ran, and performed far above my expectations, and I found myself reading in a variety of lighting conditions, in all of which it functioned perfectly as an e-reader. Haven't tested the camera's yet, or Poweramp, or some of the more advanced features yet but I'll update this review once I get a chance to play with them a bit more. Oh, and lest I forget, the battery life on this bad girl is beyond sweet. Since my initial charge, and using it moderately to heavily for three days, I haven't hit 60% of the battery use yet.  Also a quick note for those wondering about cases, the device fits in my Navitech case like a glove, with none of the buttons or ports being blocked (besides the rear camera of course). So far, after testing all of the aforementioned tablets, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 is serious contender with all of them, especially the Kindle Fire. For only an extra $50 you get expandable memory up to 32GB (a huge plus in my book), two cameras, ICS without the need to root anything, full access to Google Play, and more. Unless you're a serious power user this tablet is more than capable of handing most anything you throw at it. While a bit of a downgrade from it's Samsung siblings, for the price you currently won't find a better tablet.\n\nUPDATE 4-26-2012: Been using the Peel remote app with the built in IR blaster for over a day now and to say I'm impressed would be an understatement. I have a brokSonic TV that I use for television watching, as well as my PC monitor. While the input (i.e. switching from HDMI, to coaxial/TV, to component, etc.) is not supported by the app, it more than meets my needs. Turns my TV on in the morning, and is able to switch channels on my Comcast DTA. Now for those of you who have Comcast and a DTA (the small smartphone sized box like device), you know that there is no guide for us. And this is where Peel, and the IR Blaster captured my heart, as not only does is function as smart remote, but also has an awesome program guide built into the app. So now I can see what is on TV at any given time and allow me to instantly switch to the channel. This functions either automatically by clicking the Watch on TV button under the show currently on, or if like me and the app seems to want to double down on numbers (i.e. changing to channel 33 instead of 3) can be done manually by pressing the appropriate channel button in the upper right hand corner. A very minor annoyance, but considering me not having to give Comcast $9 a month more just for the privilege of having a guide, I give the IR Blaster, and Peel remote app, two huge thumbs up.\n\nUPDATE 4-30-2012: Poweramp works like a champ on this tablet. The sounds while not mind blowing, are crip, with good lows, mids, and highs. The bass is more than sufficient for listening to music through the speakers, but as always if I need deeper richer sound I just plug in my JBud J3's and enjoy my tunes.\n\nUPDATE 6-6-2012: Finally got the Poetic case for this tablet, and got a chance to take come videos and pictures with the rear camera. While I wouldn't substitute this for my DSLR (obviously I guess lol), it works awesome as a standard point and shoot camera and camcorder, taking pictures in surprisingly great quality. Also I wanted to note that in bright light, watching videos with any dark scenes is difficult, but it's not so big an issue as to take away from all of the awesome positives."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I owned a 10.1 in galaxy tab for almost a year and ipad 2 the same period of time. I strayed from the apple (i-Shackle) product because I hate being told what form factors I NEED to buy or use to obtain seamless transfer.\n\nTo the 1 star due to seeing it had a proprietary port LOL yes lets give an item 1 star for that. Lots of companies are going this route because it helps in the development of far more future upgrades. The vast array of connectors gives developers more options on what they can come up with. i.e dock stations with keyboard and mouse. Yes a usb also can but since 2.0 has a VERY limited power source and a tiny contact patch it makes for pathetically slow connections when using something with multiple inputs. Say keyboard dock with mouse pad, 2 attached usb devices to the dock etc.\n\nTo the other 1 star review who likes gingerbread more, stick with the old form factor. Ice cream sandwich (ICS) aka android 4.0 is brand spanking new. When Gingerbread was first released we had to hustle to make all of our apps compatible. I have had no such problems with mine and I'm sorry you did.\n\nRemember this is not a PRIME class device. You want that then by all means go buy a Transformer Prime. This is the 1 and only (until later this year with the asus/nexus google branded tablet) 7\" device by a major manufacturer to compete in this very low price category. For the price of one 10.1 inch high end tablet or Ipad you can get 2 of these.\n\nThe device is very snappy. I love android 4.0 ICS and look forward to the slew of improvements samsung will inevitably make. Camera isn't the greatest so just use your cell phone which I'm sure has a better one. I don't know why you would rather turn on a tablet to take a picture instead of yanking out your cell anyway. Screen is very bright. Though not 1280x800 like I wish it was reading is still very easy on the eyes. The screens touch response is PHENOMENAL. IPAD level response, it's so very nice to have.\n\n7\" is the perfect size for us personally. If I want larger I use my laptop at home. The remote control feature is an A+ extra.\n\n1 CON - The moment your fingers or hand touch the back the WIFI drops 1 signal bar. Consistently and always. Same deal that the iphone 4 suffered. I use mine in a case so it doesn't happen to me but it is a definite note to take. HEAR THAT SAMSUNG PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM FOR THOSE WHO WILL INEVITABLY COMPLAIN AND GIVE IT 1 STAR BECAUSE OF IT.\n\nI whole heartily disagree with people giving 1 or 2 stars to an item when they don't like one, two, or even three things about it. Remember you are buying a $250 full feature tablet. The very same features you are paying $200 for when you buy your cell phone but without a 2 year contract.\n\nAndroid phone users (baring htc and Motorola i believe) download FoxFi app from the marketplace and turn your phone into a wifi hotspot for free. Internet for your tablet anywhere you go. Just mind those data charges if you aren't with sprints unlimited plans for some reason. I hope this review was helpful.\n\n(update 3 months later)\nWe love this tablet. Again it's worth noting that without a cover/case on it your fingers contact with the back drops the wifi signal 1-2 points. 4.0.4 update was received over the air this morning. The fact that it has a microSD card memory slot is a huge perk over the nexus 7. I had been waiting to purchase the nexus 7. However with only 16gb available with the high end one, it doesn't seem enough. With media for the kids alone it's almost full. We love this tablet and my 2.5 year old has already figured it out. If that doesn't tell you how easy it is I don't know what will. Definitely a Samsung family now."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "The galaxy tab 2 7 inch looked promising coming out of the package. The design was solid, but for some reason it does not feel stable in my hand and I am constantly worried about dropping it. This is probably because this is my first tablet. I'm sure some sort of protective case will make me feel more at ease. The screen is very responsive and the internet pages open quickly. Other than that, there is little else I can offer because SAMSUNG HAS NO MANUAL AVAILABLE ONLINE!!! Customer service is very important these days, and I find no manual EXTREMELY aggravating! Fortunately,I am fairly computer savvy and can navigate most devices without a manual. Most of the time,a manual is an afterthought. I'm sure that someone will fix this problem and my experience will get better, but for now, it bothers me that someone got paid a lot of money to screw this up. After all the positive things I have read about Samsung, I expected better.\n\nUpdated review:\n OK, for all of you that complained that I did not write a review (actually it was a review of Samsung support more than anything else). First, there is still no online manual accessible from the device itself unless you use the \"full site option\" hidden in the fine print at the bottom of the Samsung mobile homepage. People who are \"computer savvy\" will be able to figure that out, but honestly, this device isn't for your hardcore user and my wife or 15yo son might have a problem figuring that out. That's who this device is tailored for, the new user who only wants to spend $249, not people like Kenneth J. Conner, Carl E. Simms, or myself, who have the ability to assemble our own computer's from scratch. I DID contact Samsung customer support who told me that there was no manual available at the time; now there is, but again, only through the full site.\n\nThe device works as expected. The screen is vibrant and great for watching movies. The screen is generally responsive, which is expected as well. I have noticed that when you need to tap something small, such as an \"x\" to close an internet screen, it requires multiple taps and becomes frustrating. Some people have complained about google's integration into the android system; I find far less clutter and better functionality than the extra's that are integrated into my Verizon phone by Motorola. The charging/USB cord is a little annoying as well. I find the shape of the male plug for the device unnecessary and unfriendly. If I lose it, break it, step on it, etc, I am forced to buy another from samsung instead of being able to use one of the 6 or 7 mini/micro USBs that I already own. The camara is ok if you have light (no flash), but I don't think many people take pictures with a tablet, so it's a non-issue. The power button is fairly sensitive and I have a habit of pressing it by mistake. Again, trivial, just move your hand.\n\nTo wrap up, it does what it's expected to...no more, no less. It doesn't \"wow\" me. My phone's a better device, but it costs more and has more competition. Am I glad I bought it? Not really. Is it bad enough to send back? Not really. Will I put it to good use? Sure. Would I recommend it? I would probably tell someone to wait for another device to come out. If the Blackberry Playbook had an expansion slot, I would get that instead (got one and returned it because I needed more space)."}

I own the iPad 1 and the current iPad, and my beefs with them are lack of expandable memory and no flash.  This little device has both, although you must download the flash app from the google store first for it to work.  The IR blaster set up easily with my Sony TV, and I love the TV guide that is in the Peer app.  The Kindle app gives a very clear text display.  There is photo editing and even a cute little movie making app on here!  Polaris office is good.  I love the keyboard because the numbers are set above the letters like a regular keyboard.  Dictation works great.  No problems with WIFI here.  My only disappointment is that the screen display lacks the vibrant color of other Samsung devices, but some people might prefer that.  The display is adequate for most purposes, and you can set the font size to large, which helps with text.  Pinch and zoom is smooth.  The only app I find unacceptable is Facebook for Android.  The text is very small and fixed.  You cannot zoom it, so I can read it easier on my phone than on here.  It looks better by going through the web browser, but still won't zoom.  Other web pages are easily enlarged. There is a slight lag sometimes while scrolling, but you can open multiple pages with tabs, which the original iPad lacks.  The speakers and volume are better than you will find in most laptops and netbooks and other tablets.  Screenshots are so easily done that you have to be a little careful not to hit that button accidentally.  If you install the \"active applications\" or program monitor widget, you can monitor what is open, and shut apps down periodically to save battery.  Bluetooth works great, and will accept my Apple devices, but the Apple devices won't accept my Samsung devices.  Unfortunately, it's my understanding that the adapter to load pictures from an SD card does not work with this device.  I got the sleeve for the 7.0 and it fits well and doesn't add a lot of bulk. I just wanted something to protect it when I threw it in my purse.  For me personally, I prefer the\n8.9 size and screen, but it costs more and does not have expandable memory.\n\n6/8/12 New feature!  Now Bright House Digital Cable has added the ability for certain android devices to watch TV (as long as you are in your own house), and it works perfectly on this device. That's another bonus, because cable does not work on all tabs."}

I have tried the Kindle Fire and the Nook Tablet, and the restrictions in the OS make them fall short compared to the Galaxy Tab 2. Ice Cream Sandwich is sleek, quickly to respond, and very customizable. The best Android OS out there so far, without doubt! I dare to say it's even more customizable than OS X / OS 5 in some aspects. There are numerous apps and it allows for third party apps to be installed as well.\nOne of the silly things I care about is wallpaper customization and the sorts, and I was disappointed that Kindle Fire didn't allow for that. This tablet, however, is super customizable as far as those things go.\nThe size is perfect. I don't care for the 10inch displays of the iPad. I wanted something I could hold in my hands, put in a purse and carry around without having to worry with its size. Display resolution is great. I couldn't tell the difference between it and the Fire. I haven't tried the IR or bluetooth functions yet, but I'm still playing with it. Yes it has a proprietary cable, but seriously, what doesn't these days? Also, the camera resolution is not that great, but I'm not going around carrying a tablet to use the camera. I am photographer so that's the last thing on my mind when I shopped for a tablet. It's okay for the occasional snapshot, but if you want superb pictures, get a decent camera or pay extra for a tablet with good camera. Can't have it all man, but this tablet is an absolute bang for the buck!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "So I did a lot of research; I've been in the market for a tablet for 5 or 6 weeks. I really wanted to wait for the Asus/Google Nexus announcement, but I don't want to hang out that long on the hope that it will be announced and have everything I want. This tablet has almost everything on my list I'll detail out why it got a 4 from me in a minute.\n\nThe Good\nPretty responsive over all, and while some folks might take issue with the picture, I've never been particularly concerned that my device have the deepest blacks, and the most staggering whites on the block. You might notice a small amount of lag if you have tons of apps open (as I tend to do) and if you have a samsung/nexus smartphone as I do, you may notice the setup is not quite as set it and forget it as that. I am still looking for a couple of apps/widgets such as my photos from my google accoutn. I've heard other reviewers say that ICS seems a bit cramped on a device this small, and I can't say that I disagree, but for the most part it does what it says on the box and I imagine you'll run into the same situation on nearly any 7 inch tablet with a similar resolution. I wanted this device for Netflix when I'm on the road, Google Reader for cooking in the kitchen, and Evernote for taking notes in meetings. This does that and then some and you can't say that about the kindle fire. To me that's worth $50. I haven't run through an entire battery cycle yet, but so far it seems solid, moreso than my phone in fact due to the lack of cell connectivity drain.\n\nThe Bad\nAs I said, the GB of RAM, and downgraded processor are noticeable vs beefier models only if you have lots of apps open. Other reviewers have talked about the junky camera and I will echo that sentiment, though if you'd just doing instagram or something of that ilk I doubt you'll be disappointed.\n\nThe Bottom Line\nI have no regrets about pulling the trigger on this device at this time. It does what i want, and I even got a logitech bluetooth keyboard. Easy to hookup. Easy to use. My wife took to it like a duck to water while watching TV last night. One other bonus, which I didn't know when I bought it was that it's incredibly easy to switch between accounts. If she has a recipe on her google reader, or in her email, the device is connected to both accounts at all times, so it's just a few taps to get there. Good stuff."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "This is my first tablet and I bought it mainly for college purposes.  In addition to owning hard copies of my textbooks, I also have pdf files of them and needed a device I could save and open them (instead of lugging around 25 lbs of books).  I also needed to browse the internet as some of my homework is online and needed flash support for the occasional cramster/chegg help.  I HATE having to use the library's computers on campus.  The people are a distraction, but I do not want to lug around my laptop or deal with it's crappy battery.  So, I bought the Tab 2.\n\nFirst thing I did was log onto chegg and my heart sank when the solutions part of the website did not work.  Once I found apps I realized I needed to download Adobe Flash Player.  Done.  Website now works properly.\n\nNext, I could not figure out how to connect the tablet to my pc.  I tried using Samsung Kies with no luck.  It would not connect.  So, before I logged into Dropbox on the tablet, I emailed myself the links for the textbook pdf's.  When I opened the links, the files were downloaded onto the tablet.  I cannot figure out how to officially store them somewhere, but they are under \"Downloads\" so I can access them w/o internet connection.\n\nAt first I opened the pdf's with Polaris Office and they were hard to navigate and some parts of the Calculus book did not display right.  I opened with Amazon Kindle and soooooo much better!  Easier to navigate and everything displayed correctly.  Some of the text is hard to read with the tab in portrait mode, but is totally fine in landscape mode.\n\nSo far it appears the tablet will work for the minimum I need it to do.  I can now have my books in class w/o carrying them and can do my homework on the fly.  I will definitely need to figure out how to transfer files and store them correctly on the tablet.\n\nThe extra stuff seems to work fine.  Web browsing, Facebook, Draw Something, etc.  All mindless time wasters.  ;)"}

I have been using Samsung Galaxy Player 4 for several months and I'm very happy with it, and it uses standard USB cable.\n\nI played around with this Galaxy Tab 2 for a good 15 minutes or more at BestBuy and everything is great and was planning on buying it in a few days, but this proprietary crap means I'm likely going to hold off buying and wait for the rumored Google/ASUS tablet that's comparable to this Galaxy Tab 2 in spec and price, maybe cheaper, hopefully that will use standard USB cable.\n\nI stopped buying Sony products because of their proprietary memory sticks and I hope Samsung does not go that route.\n\nI found out about this proprietary USB cable from forbes.com"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I have a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kindle-Fire/dp/B0051VVOB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kindle Fire</a>&nbsp;and do enjoy using it (for the most part) -- love the form factor, enjoy the apps that I can get for it and am very pleased with the Kindle eReader app and ability to share books across all our Kindles. But when we were offered an opportunity to check out the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 a few days early, we jumped at the chance.  The Kindle Fire is great at what it does, but its custom Android O/S, non-standard Web browser, limited selection of apps, lack of expandable storage and lack of Bluetooth support leave me cold.\n\n*Browser Issues*\n\nI've experienced multiple issues trying to browse web sites with the Kindle's Silk browser which work fine on the Galaxy Tab 2 and other full-fledged Android devices.  Although Flash videos can be played on the Kindle Fire (if you enable Flash in the Silk browser's setting menu, which is OFF by default), Flash-based games on the Web such as Words with Friends and Bejeweled Blitz (both on Facebook) are painfully jittery and sluggish on the Kindle Fire.  The native Words with Friends app does work well on the Kindle, for the most part, but not the web browser-based version.  But Flash support on mobile devices is spotty at best so this is not the worst flaw in the Kindle.  Also, the content management system we use on our web site is able to load pages (articles) on the Fire, but unable to scroll within large text input windows.  The same problem does not occur on the Galaxy Tab 2's browser.  The Silk browser is able to access many web sites properly, but when it fails, there isn't much you can do since updates to the Silk browser have been few and far between.\n\n*App and content space*\n\nThe Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 each come with 8 GB of internal storage on board. Some of this is used for O/S and system files which leaves even less available for apps and media content. The Kindle Fire has no expandable storage, as it is designed to work in \"The Cloud.\"  In other words, they expect you to store music and movies on an internet-based cloud storage area for access when you want it.  The big caveat here is that the Kindle Fire offers only WiFi access (no 4G support) so if you do not happen to have a WiFi hotspot or home network handy (like, for example, on a long distance car trip), your cloud-based content is completely inaccessible.  I filled up the Kindle Fire's internal storage within the first six weeks of ownership. If I want to install more apps or add local content now, I'll have to remove some from the device.  These apps and content are still available to download later from the cloud, if I wish to do so, but this really isn't convenient.  The Galaxy Tab 2 also lacks 4G support (in its current version) but its standard microSDHC slot allows you to expand the on-board storage up to an additional 32 GB, which is plenty of room to move your movies, music and additional content to be stored locally without requiring access to the internet.\n\n*Bluetooth Support*\n\nWhen I am taking notes at an event or meeting, there's nothing like a full sized QWERTY keyboard.  With the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, you can connect just about any standard Bluetooth keyboard and happily start typing away at full speed.  With the Kindle Fire, since it lacks Bluetooth support, you do not have this option.  Also, when you want to listen to music, movies or apps on the Fire without bothering those around you, you'll need to plug in a pair of standard headphones (with the jack awkwardly placed on the bottom of the device instead of the top).  With the Galaxy Tab 2, not only is the jack placed more logically at the top, but you can also use Bluetooth 3.0 stereo headphones for high quality sound without the wired tether.\n\n*Cameras*\n\nThe Kindle Fire lacks an on-board camera while the Galaxy Tab 2 includes both a front and rear-facing camera.  Admittedly the camera on the Galaxy Tab can't really compare with a real digital camera (particularly indoors) but having the camera available on the Galaxy does allow you to snap a quick pic when the real camera may have been left at home, or participate in Google+ Hangouts (not an option on the camera-free Kindle).\n\n*Limited App Support*\n\nAmazon's Kindle Fire, like Barnes and Noble's Nook Tablet, is not compatible with the Google Play Store app market without rooting the device (not for beginners).  To install apps on the Fire, you have to use the proprietary Amazon app market which has a limited selection of apps. There's no access to cool apps like the Logitech Harmony app, or the Samsung or Panasonic remote control Android apps for their TVs and Blu-ray players. The list of Android apps you can't get for the Fire goes on (and on... and on). And speaking of remote apps, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 comes pre-loaded with the Peel app which uses the Galaxy Tab's integrated IR port (another option not available on the Kindle Fire or Nook Tablet) to control an entire home theater or multimedia system *without* any additional out of pocket expense.  It's there; it works; it's great!  Also, if you want access to the Amazon app store from the Galaxy tablet, you can do this by downloading and installing the Amazon apk. I've done this and have been able to access my Amazon-purchased apps on the Galaxy tablet.\n\nOverall, I'd say the Kindle Fire is great for people who like to read Kindle books, who are satisfied with a smaller selection of apps, who like streaming movies and TV shows from Amazon Prime (as I do) and who don't need the extra flexibility of a full-fledged Android tablet.  But for those who do want those extras - Bluetooth, cameras, expandable storage, Android O/S 4.0 - the new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 provides an excellent upgrade for a minimal amount of additional cash.  Highly recommended.\n\nYou can read our comprehensive reviews of the Kindle Fire, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 and Nook Tablet on Big Picture Big Sound.\n\n2013 update: This review was written in April, 2012 and is based on a comparison to the first generation Kindle Fire which was the only Kindle fire that was available at that time.  The Kindle Fire HD does address *some* of the limitations of the Kindle Fire including adding a front camera, mic and Bluetooth headset support but there's still no access to Google Play Store unless you root the device.  Also, there is still no extended storage option (e.g., microSD card) on the Fire or Fire HD as there is on the Samsung tablet."}

In the places where my computer has very good reception - 4 bars, and iPad shows 3 bars I can get only 1-2 bars on my new Galaxy - \"weak\".  The same happened in every spot with free WiFi, like Barnes and Noble. etc - 1-2 bars maximum. I can get 4 bars only within 10 feet from my router.\n\nI am wondering if this is common problem or I just got defective item. Does anyone else have such problem?

Setup was easy, the ICS software is great, excellent screen etc.\n\nHere's the caveat:\nThe Google play store, has  no parental controls, unlike Apple, and no way to set up an allowance for my kid, also unlike Apple. Also, you don't have to enter any password to download an app?\nThe upside, is I get an email whenever an app is downloaded, whether it costs anything or not.\nI've had to lay down the law and tell my daughter that if I see an Email regarding an app that I haven't told her is ok.\n\nI have no idea if such parental controls exist on the Nook or Fire, but I wish Android had them\n\nThis is my ONLY issue with the tablet and I'm very happy with my purchase."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I have had the original Galaxy Tab 7 for about a year.  It love it.  7\" is the perfect size to bring along to read a book or watch a movie.  It is large enough to be able to pull up web pages (even in \"full Site\" mode) and actually read them.  I have used that old work horse every day that I've owned it.\n\nSo Why did I upgrade to this version when I love the original so much?  2 reasons.  This one has Android Version 4.0 (I need this for a camera remote control app - DSLR Controller) and I liked the idea of a built in remote control for my AV system.\n\nSo the verdict?  -- I love it.  It is sleeker than the original.  A beautiful bright and vibrant screen.  Good Battery life (so far).  and very peppy thanks to it's dual core.\n\nThings I love:\n\nPrice:----- Way to go Samsung.  Very affordable for what you get.\nSize:------ This thing is perfect for book reading, watching movies on a plane, and just carrying round without it feeling too big.\nScreen:---- Like I said, this think looks greet for media like movies and pictures.\nBuild:------ This thing is solid.  I have been very impressed with Samsung lately\nRemote:---- I LOVE the remote on this thing.  I quickly set up with me home theater system (TV, Cable Box, Receiver, DVD, etc)  The built in app stepped me through the process.  and now I can tweak to my heart's content.  This is better than my Harmony remote, because I can make updates right from the device without having to hook up to the computer.  It also give  a live schedule of what is on with single touch access.  Better than the guide button on the cable box.  Did I mention I love this app??\nAndroid:--- Version 4.0 - Great tablet OS.  Like it much better than iOS.  I love apple product, but never bought into the apple ecosystem, so I prefer Android.\nKies:------ A cool way to wirelessly transfer data, pics, files, etc. between your Tab and a computer just using a browser.  Very Slick, you will like it.\n\nThings I like:\n\nCamera:---- The shooter on this is OK.  Plenty of pixels and shoots well in good light.  it is OK but not great.  Not an issue for me since I never used the camera on my old Tab.  There is also not a built in flash.  OK with me at this price point.\n\nThings I don't like:\n\nProprietary cable:-- OK, I had to think hard of something I don't like about this.  I prefer when micro USB is used for everything from Charging to Data transfer.  However, I have a couple cables from my original tab, so again, not a deal breaker for me.\n\nI will update when I've had more time to try this thing out, but so far, I am impressed.\n\nIf you do not have a 7\" tab, and are looking to get one - buy this.  you will not be disappointed!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B007P4VOWC", "review": "I was a heartbeat away from buying a B&N tablet until I saw that this tablet was about to be released. I have to say, the wait was worth it.\n\nMy main use for this tablet is for multimedia on the go. This tablet can do all of that and more for a low price and it can do so much more than the B&N tablet without rooting it. Within a few hours, I had downloaded enough apps from Google Play to customize this tablet to my liking.\n\nFirst of all, my comics on the 7 inch screen are bright, vibrant and very easy to read (see uploaded image in product picture gallery). The Perfect Viewer app works very well with this tablet. Now all my comics are available on the go.\n\nNetflix comes pre-installed with this device. After a quick update, I was signed in to my account and watching shows and movies. Sadly, Huluplus and HBOgo are not supported on this device, but that's the apps' fault, not the tablet. It probably won't be long before they will support the Galaxy Tab.\n\nThe Peel smart remote works on my tv just fine. I can control the tv, though it doesn't support my cable box, just yet. Again, it's a fault with the app, not the tablet. The app was nice enough to automatically give me the option to send an error email to the developers.\n\nSites like mangafox look great on this screen and the ability to zoom in and out on frames with a quick gesture is great.\n\nThe Kindle app comes pre-installed on this device. I also loaded the Nook app. I was able to download all my ebooks from that account. The page turns are much faster than my old Nook ebook reader and the words read very well.\n\nOnce I installed flash player, I was able to watch videos on websites both on the stock internet browser and on Dolphin Browser.\n\nI cannot be more happy with this device."}
