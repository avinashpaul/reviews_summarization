{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I picked up the Xoom yesterday at a local store and so far I am quite pleased. I spent about 6 solid hours toying with it and yes, there are a few things I would like changed about the os itself but I know this is Honeycomb 1.0 and updates will be coming. A few force close issues, fingerprints and dust are attracted (just ordered screen protector from Amazon to hopefully help with this) but the hardware itself appears solid. People have been complaining about the weird placement of the power button, but I think it's perfect. Same with volume controls. Didn't have any issues with that. Still trying to get used to holding a tablet. I really liked the archos 10.1 idea of a kickstand, but I will figure out something. The only burning question I have (for me) is, do I really NEED this??? My answer so far is a resounding NO. I have a computer, I have my android phone. I don't travel, I don't need it for business, I don't need that much portability....but man, it really is nice to have. It's a total luxury item. Again, this is just my opinion. The device itself really is great. I sat in the apple store for an hour or so when the first ipad came out and I was bored and unimpressed after 1 hour. Sure they have a ton of apps, but so does android. I've already loaded in my favorite 2.x apps and most of them work perfectly...they're not honeycomb optimized, but I was happy with them. There's always going to be something bigger (or smaller in the tablet world) and cheaper with better specs in the future, but I figured I've been waiting long enough and I was really itching to get into the tablet game. I wanted solid piece of hardware which this is. I also wanted a tablet that would most likely be the first to get software updates. The software, while great now, is not perfect but it will get there eventually...I have total faith in Google. Anyways, I know I'm not the best reviewer out there, but bottom line is so far I'm very pleased with my purchase."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I bought this tablet because I love my Droid X and I was curious to see what something with a larger screen would be.  I am happy to say its amazing.  I know all the hype is about the iPad and iPad 2, but if you prefer Android, this is the tablet to get.  Customizable, fast, and well designed.  Some have commented that it is heavy compared to other devices, but I think it makes it feel sturdy (sometimes things that are too light feel cheap).  The placement of power key on the back is weird but not horrible and easy to feel so you don't have to turn it over.  Not all your normal apps from your Android phone will work with Honeycomb, but a lot do.  Some apps won't show up in the market, some just don't work right (or not \"optimized for use with a tablet\"), and others force close before they even open.  Angry Birds is SWEET on a big screen, so is MiniSquandron.\n\nThe MicroSD card slot doesn't work yet, but it will with an eventual software upgrade (unknown date of when that will happen) but with 32 gigs of space unless you have videos or a ton of music and pics, its a lot. The web browser is good, better than a regular Android browser on a smart phone, but its still hard to replace the full functionality of a PC or Mac browser (i.e. Firefox, Chrome, or Safari).  I want this to be a laptop replacement (I have a desktop for regular computing) and its feasible for me to make the switch.  Although it'll still take sometime to adjust."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Picked up the WiFi only version on Sunday. Went with WiFi only because I already have a DroidX and can use it as a WiFi hot spot cheaper than going with the 3G plan for the Xoom. I played with this and the iPad 2 side by side prior to deciding. iPad does somethings better and faster (switching screen orientation) and the Xoom does somethings better and faster. The advantage with the Xoom is having 2x the amount of RAM built in. So things like Google Maps keeps up better on the Xoom. I really like the browser on the Xoom better too, but that, like most of the rest of this, is personal preference.\n\nThe good:\n\n- quality build\n- great flexibility\n- great camera's front and rear\n- fully loaded WiFi only version (still has the GPS, gyro and even a barometer)\n- Great graphics, nice display\n- Not required to use iTunes to set it up and use it\n\nThe not so good:\n\n- Screen is a fingerprint magnet, worse I have ever had.\n- Not as easy to use out of the box as the iPad\n- Not many aps for it yet\n\nAt the end of the day, if you use an iPhone and like it, you will like the iPad 2 better. If you use a good Android phone today and like it, you will like the Xoom much better. I spent Friday night and Saturday helping a friend set up their iPhone and the frustration over the lack of flexibility ultimately made my mind up for me. Once you get used to the flexibility you have with Android, you will get frustrated quickly with iOS.\n\nAnyway, that is my opinion after using the Xoom for 1 full day...lol."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Short and sweet.\nThe best Tablet out by far so far.\nAll the best stats, connections, power, size, speed, graphics, and OS. Check out the stats for yourself.  Compare for yourself the \"apple to oranges\" differences.  I say oranges because you really cannot compare the \"two\" as the xoom will soon be a \"full\" web browsing experience and the speed of 4g.  Sorry Ipad loyalists, I own one of those too.  It is now sitting on my desk, and it sure is pretty, but getting dusty. Xoom is now in the building and has taken over management by storm.\nAre you a prime member?  Well all the movies steaming right on your device.  Want more?  Plug it HDMI direct to your TV and There you go.  There are so many advantages and no real disavatages other than the break away from the polished, but linear universe of the iOS.\nIf you are buying a tablet PC, you can't beat the Xoom. Not even with all newly announced upcoming tablets from the other companies.\nMotorola will have the new updates of the honeycomb before the others even get it. You watch.\nThe OS is brilliant and very well thought out.  Efficient and capable is the understatement of the year here.  The learning curve is short and the new little ways that you can customize and make it work for you is endless.  VERY DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER TABLET OS's.\nThis unit together with Amazon is a bright future indeed.\nExample:  Last night I downloaded a full featured album and watched a free movie from Amazon. (3.99 total) (Yes, out of the courtesy of Amazon's heart the music did also go automatically into my iTunes as well.lol.... BUT WHY.?)  I have them in my MP3 folder in which I can listen to, share, burn, move, transfer and use all I want across my phone, car stereo, usb stick, cd, send a song by email and listen with any type of player there is.  This is not to mention the Amazon mp3 app for your music,\nAND THE AWESOME NEW AMAZON ANDROID MARKET.  (TRY BEFORE YOU BUY!) Amazon you are lighting things up and it is awesome!!!!!!!!)\nC'mon people.  Do you not see the writing on the wall.  I do.\nTablet, Productivity, ease of use, efficiency, convenience, speed, communication, entertainment, lower cost, and the bottom line is, this is the direction that gives us the End Game of More TIME to do what we really want to do. (Even is that is to play more games.)\nNot sold yet?  Write me I can tell you more. \"I have the time\" lol"}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Loved the tablet when I got it. I closed an eye every time it crashed on me or for the lack of apps hoping everything would improve over time.\nNow I'm changing my rating once more but if I could I would have rated it zero stars. To sum it up, most apps crash on me especially browsers if I'm doing something intensive, keyboard input lags terribly to the point where I miss keys or browser opens wrong links because it had failed rendering the page in a timely manner.\nWeb browsers are also inferior and you can't find one that does all, you need Firefox, dolphin, skyfire etc because one crashes a lot, the other doesn't display the pages properly, another only renders pages in mobile mode etc.\nYou need a shaolin monk's patience to get along with this toy without banging your head against the wall.\nTo add insult to the injury, the rubber housing has worn out just by opening and closing the case (got the official Motorola portfolio case) and was pampered all the time I had it, never mishandled it.\n\nI would not recommend this to anyone, in fact I would not recommend getting a tablet, be it android or ios powered, they're just crippled underpowered gimmicks. If you need to be mobile carry a laptop or a net book and save yourself the headache."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I bought this on Amazon but just came back from a friends house that got one in-store from Staples. I must say it's pretty good.\n\nIf you're familiar with Androids, you know that you can do TONS of things with your device and the Xoom isn't any different. Most people can complain about how slow and laggy the Xoom is compared to the Ipad2 however if you think about it, Apple doesn't have true multitasking which controls the memory it uses making it seem less laggy. Also for the people who complain about the slow browser experience between the Xoom and Ipad2, people may not have noticed this but ipad2 tends to show the page much faster than the Xoom however it doesn't fully load it. (if you scroll on the ipad2, you will see those white and gray grids). I know many people don't factor these \"small\" details in however it should be known. Xoom tends to show the page slower however will load up the entire page when it's done.\n\nI'm not a Apple or Android fanboy, i'm a fanboy of customization therefore I went with the Xoom. (Previous owner of Ipad, droid, htc evo, and tested out ipad2)\n\nOnce I get my Xoom tomorrow, I will begin playing with it more and post up some reviews."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I'll keep this brief:\n\nIf you want a tablet with flexibility, robust connectivity, and nearly unlimited customization options, buy a XOOM.\nIf you prefer a curated approach to hardware and software, ensuring more consistent quality but with significantly reduced versatility and choice, grab an iPad 2.\n\nNeither choice will disappoint you, but if you're willing to wait a bit for tablet-optimized applications in exchange for the promise of (almost) total freedom to use your hardware as you wish (like I am), the XOOM is probably the way to go."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "First of all I want to say that I own both Apple and Google/Android devices. I own iPod Touch and have played with iPad of family member who own the device. I also played with iPad 2 quite a bit at the store as well as from a friend who got it on launch day. I currently own original Motorola Droid and looking to upgrade to newer Android phone this summer. It is difficult not to compare Xoom to its competitor aka iPad 2. Therefore, this review will entail Xoom features (Wifi version) along with comparison to iPad 2.\n\nOperating System - An iPad is more akin to a smartphone where as a Xoom is more akin to a laptop (Best Buy actually has it in laptop section instead with other Android tablets like Samsung Galaxy).  Honeycomb feels more like a tablet. It's not just a row of apps and wasted space like iOS. Plus, you have room for customization (widget, live wallpaper, theme etc). There is also little detail that tech savvy will appreciate (outline grid, advanced settings, google labs etc) Honeycomb is still a bit buggy but not to the point that it becomes annoying. I only have several force close (app closed due to error) once in a while (Not all phone apps work with Xoom..yet). Obviously iOS which is a proven OS and was out almost 4 years ago is more stable than the Honeycomb, a brand new OS (optimized for tablet use) that was out a month ago along with its SDK. Google know Honeycomb still needs improvement, I know Honeycomb is unfinished and I don't mind waiting for even better experience.\n\nAlso, it's easy to transfer files between computer and Xoom. Just plug in USB and it acts as a hard drive then you drag and drop the files you want. There's also apps like ES File Explorer and Astro File Manager that help manage files/folder (like Window explorer). I believe iOS requires other softwares unless you just do music/movies through iTunes. Oh and I forget to mention that I hate having to everything tied/synced through iTunes. On Xoom, there's more freedom and you are not stuck with one software like iTunes.\n\nWinner: To each his own but I like Honeycomb better.\n\nDesign/Apperance/Screen - Xoom is heavier but that is due to a solid build quality which I love. It is also thicker and has wider screen (more appropriate for movies than iPad 2). Although Xoom has higher screen resolution, iPad 2 still has brighter screen and more vivid look.\n\nWinner: iPad 2 by little bit\n\nUser Interface - Some people say Honeycomb is too complicated to use. Well maybe to those who has been using only iPad. For someone who use both, I have to say it is pretty simple to use. iOS is more intuitive and foolproof but there is much more detail/option on Xoom that many people will appreciate.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nMultitasking - One button and it takes you to 5 most recent apps for easy switching on Xoom. iPad 2 sort of have multitasking but not a true multitasking experience.\n\nWinner: Xoom\n\nBrowser - If you use Chrome browser before, it is pretty much like that on Xoom. I prefer tabbed browsing over having to press button to open various windows on Safari on iOS device. You can type search directly on address bar like Chrome. You can sync bookmarks through your Google account. And yes I know there are other browser apps in the market. But for a stock browser app, Xoom has a better experience.\n\nWinner: Xoom\n\nApps - iPad is way ahead in term of apps and it is because original iPad had at least 1 year head start vs Xoom. Not to mention Honeycomb is unfinished and SDK was recently released. However, the tablet apps that are available on Android market, most of them work great and look awesome. UPDATE: It turned out there're lots more Honeycomb compatible apps (I'm talking 1,000+). You just have to use keyword search such as \"tablet\" \"xoom\" \"honeycomb\" to discover the apps. Note that you can still use Android phone apps. The phone apps get stretched out but still keep the high resolution thus they don't look bad on the screen whatsoever. Give it time.\n\nWinner: iPad 2\n\nCustomization - This is my favorite part about Android. You have open customization from themes, widgets to customized home screen and live wallpapers. iOS has none of that unless you jailbreak the device.\nWinner: Xoom\n\nNotification - If you have iPhone and iPad, you know how notification can be quite painful. Xoom has better notification system that show up briefly in bottom right corner as you get new email, app update etc. You can press it to view all notifications or remove them. Additionally, there is also LED light blinking notification on top right of the device.\n\nWinner: Xoom\n\nHardware Performance - A5 vs Tegra 2 is still up for debate. Xoom seems to be as powerful as iPad 2 with exception of GPU (difference can be seen with gaming and screen brightness). iPad 2 has 512MB RAM vs 1 GB RAM on Xoom.\n\nWinner: ???\n\nCamera/Video/Audio - Better camera and video on Xoom thanks to its higher spec vs VGA front and lower MP back camera on iPad 2. Camera app gets a little bit of time to get used to on Xoom. Speaker on Xoom is decent and could have been louder. I wish the volume rocker is more visible on the side. It feels like the button can become stuck into the device.\n\nAlso I use DVD Catalyst 4 to convert and transfer movie to Xoom. It can convert most file types as long as it's not DRM protected (like \"Digital Copy\"). The software is pretty neat, simple to use and the pictures look great. You have option to customize the pictures, add subtitles, and get rid of black bars.\n\nWinner: Xoom OVERALL\n\nFlash - Yes, Flash is still in beta but it works great so far with a little bit of lagging but barely noticeable. Pretty smooth most of the time. I tested it on sites that use Flash like Engadget (video), Honda (car animation), Vice Versa restaurant in NYC (heavy flash site), Myspace and bandcamp (with music player on artist page). iOS has no Flash AT ALL as we all know when it comes to browsing.\n\nWinner: Xoom by a mile (until HTML5 is fully functional)\n\nBattery Life - Xoom gets about 8 - 9 hours for heavy multitasking usage. Will have to test standby time but I expect it to be less than iPad 2. iPad 2 gets at least 10 hours of heavy usage.\n\nWinner: iPad 2\n\nGPS - Just want to mention that GPS and full Google maps navigation is available on Xoom wifi. While on iPad 2, it is only available if you get 3G+wifi version. And if you use Google maps app before on Android you know that it is more extensive than map on iOS (turn-by-turn voice navigation, layers etc). Since this is a Wifi version, THERE IS cache settings on Google Maps where you can prefetch map tiles by panning over the city/region while on Wifi (up to ?? MB. Need to verify the cap). Then you can navigate to desired destination just like normal with voice navigation. You cannot change the destination halfway obviously since there is no 3G connection. The other alternative will be to tether the device with 3G/4G smartphone.\n\nWinner - Xoom\n\nNitpick - SD card slot on Xoom is still not enabled at this moment. Also, I wish Xoom can be charged through micro USB but I believe it may be because micro USB doesn't supply enough current to charge a tablet.\n\nIn the end, you may prefer one device over the other and it is to each his own. However, based on the overall factors I mentioned above, I prefer Xoom.\n\nAny questions, feel free to ask in comment."}

Battery lasts 10 to 12 hours, gets to 4% and shuts itself off, warns at 14%.  I have been plugging it to recharge after about 10 hours for an hour or so during evening meal, then again when I go to bed.  I have not been shutting down all the way because it takes quite a while to boot and is a little slow starting programs after boot.  I am well pleased overall.  There are some programs that do not work well but they don't work on my previous Xoom either so it is the software's fault.  Heavier than an iPad but a lot cheaper for a used unit."}

I gave it to my son because the Galaxy Tab simply wasn't as good. When I purchased the Galaxy Tab 10.1, I was offered 2 Galaxy Tab 7.0 for free with the exception of a 10.00 per month fee with my Everything plan. I gave one to my daughter and one to my wife. These were not near as good as this Xoom. I have a Motorola Droid Mini and I ran out of space. My Xoom is only 20% full. I use it to watch movies, sporting events, music videos and youtube. I also have a wireless keyboard that allows me to type documents as well. Google Chrome cast also works well with this as does a cable that connects my tablet with the TV and it is a clear video. I also use it to browse the internet and answer email. All in all, I will keep this until someone makes a tablet with a quality anything close to this tablet. In fact, if Verizon had a Xoom, I would have gotten it instead of the Galaxy. Anyone considering a tablet, this is a great choice."}

I got my Xoom a year and a half ago(It's now June 2014). It's rooted, and I'm running a very stable version of Kit Kat on it from Omnirom(ver. 20140523), and it runs like a champ. With the exception of weight and thickness issues it's just as capable as any full size tablet on the market. No, it's not as fast as some on the market, but I dare say that it's smooth as silk, and runs just about any of the 1,000,000 or so apps in the Android market, and it's infinitely customizable. This beast has been dropped many times and survived, not only survived, but has totally replaced the desktop.\n\nThe Xoomis a full time working tool that does everything to perfection.\n\nThis is such a wonderful tablet, built in the early days of the Android market, it has not only gotten better with age. The only reasons that I can foresee for replacing it would be the Samsung 12.2'' Note Pro (for the larger screen and the fine tip capacitative pen) or a remarkably improved Android operating system that the Xoom can't be adapted to (Android Silver maybe?)\n\nI really love my Xoom."}

If you don't have swype, put it on.\n - I love I've been able to bluetooth a keyboard since day 1.\n - The DocsToGo suite (which I paid $10 for years ago and they've tracked my license from the palm to the android) is the best you can get for editing simple documents.\n - The PDF viewer rocks!\n - The epson print apps allow me to print straight to my home PC.\n - The kids love watching netflix on it\n - The games are great\n - There are good file viewers out there to manage your media should you choose to do so (I do!)\n - I'm an android user at heart.  iOS irritates me, especially without the oops! (back) button.  I was given an iPad for Mother's day, and gave it away in lieu of this baby.\n - The only drawback to the Android tablet is that Disney seems to develop for iOS first, and so some of the new apps they advertise aren't available."}

And once it freezes, it takes 10 to 20 minutes to function properly again.  I had to call Motorola's customer services several times in three weeks to ask for assistance, but frankly they could not tell me exactly what was wrong with it, but the only way to solve the problem was to \"reboot\" it.  However, it did not reboot easily or even if it did, the screen got stuck with the Motorola logo again.  So basically it did not function when I needed it.\n\nFortunately the seller was nice enough to accept the returned product and refund in full.  But I would not try another Xoom again.  I need something more dependable."}

I have been able to do everything I hope to do with a portable media device. Watching Netflix has been a snap. Using the internet for various and sundry things like shopping or light to moderate research has been satisfactory. With the use of a Bluetooth keyboard the xoom is a capable productivity device.  Xoom has been fortunate to update to jelly bean (4.1.2), which has really shown its capacity to the fullest. A surprising nugget has been the xoom's ability to use the 5 ghz wireless band; a first I think for tablets of its era and even for many tablets today. My device was reconditioned and inexpensive. We were lucky to get it directly from Motorola. I can recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to pay the overhead of a current tablet, yet still want to enjoy the benefits of portable media."}

I usually charge up every two or three days, but I use my tablet instead of a TV and also read daily.  The speed is good.  I can't really tell that it is slower than the Nexus and suspect that internet speed might be the larger factor in determining speed.  The only thing I would change is that the speaker faces to the back, but it's adequate for watching movies.  Overall the Xoom is a very good value.\n\nUpdate - Six months down the road and the Xoom has been super reliable.

Amazon's Fire apparently has somewhat of a matte finish, so go with that, not this.\n\nFor all the resources at Motorola their incompetence on the obvious stuff is truly stunning.\n\nAnd by the way, I tried one of those matte sticker deals on it - just makes it a dull mirror. It doesn't help with visibility.\n\nAnd, uh, why should I have to mess around with some sticker anyhow? If Motorola would invest 1% of their budget into common sense I wouldn't be stuck with a $600 mirror, or have to write this review. And sure, Motorola's not the only mobile manufacturer with this problem.\n\nEven iPhones are a pain to use outdoors (although their brightness combats the problem in ways the Xoom does not). But for God's sake, it's the 21st century people. Matte screens have been around since the 90's. If a device is to be used outdoors - ever - a glossy screen renders it annoying at best, and often useless. The Xoom screen is actually invisible even sitting in a well-lit coffee shop.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "This tablet is awesome. I bought it as a replacement for my laptop, now I knew that I would still need my laptop for flash related games on the internet but I hardly ever play those anyway. This does very well for me for school. I can type papers on it using Google docs, I can slip it into my backpack and go where ever. Its very durable. I've only dropped it a couple times, and both times were hard falls on the corner and it doesn't even have a scratch. The back plate is durable too, it doesn't scratch easily. I've dragged this thing along my porch, kitchen tile, even the pavement a little, and it only has a couple scratches. Now one thing that I like about it is that in portrait orientation I can type with 2 thumbs like I can a phone. That's pretty cool. Then\nlandscape keyboard is much like a computers. This has some cool games, and it plays them all nicely, no lag at all. Wireless is pretty fast, and strong. Not as strong as my laptop, but stronger than most portable devices. I liked honeycomb, but ICS has more features and has a sleeker look in my opinion. Over all I like this tablet, and would recommend it for anyone who wants a tablet for personal and school use. Oh, and I should say that I found a dent on the back plate that wasn't there before. I think it got there from my backpack, but it gets squished in there with books and binders and clothes, so its not that bad. And the screen does fine too, there's hardly a scratch on it. Battery life is excellent by the way, I can get usually 2 days with heavy use. I've been using it for about 4 1/2 months and i plan on using it for plenty more years to come!"}

There have been times I wished I bought the iPad or Galaxy...those were the only real other choices when I purchased the Xoom. But as I learned this Xoom better I really do appreciate it and am glad I made the purchase. I am writing this review from it some several years later.\n\nOk, plain and simple...It is a work horse powerhouse. May not be as stylish as others but it will get the job done. I don't  hardly ever turn on my pc. There is just little need for it unless I am processing large photos. I use a cloud external hard drive and this Xoom pulls it right up.\n\nThe most impressive part it the durability. I have only had the zagg screen protector on it all these years. I have a 26 month old son who has loved the tablet since birth. In fact this Xoom has almost been handed down to him, except I don't know if I want to change even yet. He has banged on this as it were a drum set, spitl drinks and food all over it, dropped it on porcelain tile on the corner, screen and back side several times, knocked it off table, end table and just dropped countless times in  resturaunts. Quite honestly, I don't have the slightest clue how it is still working let alone no cracks on the screen. Can't believe the inside is still working. I am telling you this thing has seen some serious drops that I just knew was going to be a screen broken...Nope...the damage this Xoom does have is this..and please understand this is pure neglect on my\npart. In no way am I saying this is any fault of the tablet. 100% my fault or this tablet would be in perfect external condition.\n\nThere is the bottom right corner completely crushed and aluminum edge crushed and the inside edge has pushed the screen up just a tiny bit with a small indention (from the biggest drop on tile floor from 3-4 foot high). 15 other areas where the edge of the aluminum case is dented with some chipps on the powder coat. Apx 30 tiny nicks on the bottom edge (from the drums with metal all clad measuring spoons as drum sticks). several small scratches on the back and a couple teeth marks (he used to try to eat it at times) The screen is in perfect condition without a scratch on it. I used and still use the military grade stuff on the screen only. I forget the exact name but it was like zagg.\n\nMy little one knows how to use this thing awesome. He just turned 2. He asks for it by name..tablet. I hand it to him and he powers it on, unlocks it and swipes to the icon he wants...wether it be you tube to watch shows or play games or piano or whatever. He even knows how to search videos on YT and how to go home and back to what ever"}

All these issues were related to charging issues - not specific to the charger. Motorola charges $200 flat for fixes. Given that you can buy new tablet in $300 - $500 range, the repair charges are very high. Moreover I had the same issue three times. Though the quality of the overall tablet and features are comparable to others in the markets, Xoom is not as reliable as you would expect."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Honestly I'd prefer an ipad or samsung, but because I like tech and this was at a good price and I had planned to root; figuring if I brick it, it wouldn't be a total loss.\n\nBattery power/charging: Is actually pretty fricking good. Charges quickly and drains relatively slowly. Only problem is the charger isn't the kind where you can can seperate it so you can plug it into your computer. Also you can't charge it via the micro usb connector (not sure if that's stated in description). It kind of kills the mobility thing. Also the charging plug isn't standard usb so I don't know what to tell you if you lose it.\n\nAudio: Is weird. On one game and music it's pretty loud but on videos it's damn near non existent. If you got earbuds then you're good to go.\n\nVideo:The micro HDMI to HDMI is actually pretty good. But bad part is your pic doesn't flip on the tv if you when you flip the xoom to get a wider pic. Youtube vids played pretty good but vids from any other sites had issues. The camera is meh.\n\nAesthetics: It's a good size, but It's pretty awkward to grip. It's pretty solid and feels well made, but for a tablet, it's pretty heavy. You're going to feel it if you let it rest on you so you can read, watch vids etc\n\nPrograms/apps: The ones it came with were ok. Actually no they sucked. I got some different ones later on. It's still ok or whatever. I've never been partial to an android market because a lot of developers and others don't cover/care about the product working for all devices... etc. Didn't really use it till after I rooted it.\n\nOnto the rooting: Actually I just thought about who might read this lol. All in all don't do it. Motorola and google really don't want you to. They're pretty sadistic about the measures. And if you're going to do it on an android device then go with a samsung."}

I received it in pristine condition and could not have been happier.  I love this tablet for its versatility and easy customization.  The screen is great and picture quality is excellent.  It is wonderful for reading books and watching movies on the go.  The battery was one of the biggest surprises and lasts quite a bit longer than most smart phones.  I can easily go all day without charging and get plenty of use out of it.  The memory-32 gig was plenty to get going and I just ordered another 32 gig memory card to boost my memory capacity a bit more.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Bought this to stream music into the bedroom because Squeezebox is now becoming a dinosaur since Logitech had pulled the plug on the platform.  And of course having a tablet around is a nice benefit too. Looked carefully for one of the few devices that has a real usb port so that I could use my Nuforce usb dac which is light years better than my PC soundcard and also better than a Behringer USB dac that I have around.  But I am overwhelmed to find that the straight headphone output on the Xoom is at least as good as the Nuforce!  I've done some critical listening with my Beyer DT235 headphones and found that they both sound remarkably close with a solid bass and well defined mid range.  But the Xoom nicely reproduces brushed cymbals that sound more like hiss on the Nuforce.  The Nuforce will drive the headphones a bit louder but the Xoom gets the fairly inefficient Beyers up as loud as I would care to listen. And the sound is just as good on the headphone out from the dock so it makes for a convenient and great sounding combo.\nYes, the tablet may be a bit heavier than some of the competition but its very solid with a nice screen that actually has a natural, very good color balance - not too cool/blue like many displays tend to be.  Once I got through the 6 or 7 updates to get up to Jelly Bean android its a super fast responsive device.  And the dock is better than I had hoped.\nSo far happier than I had imagined."}

Just a side note I own an iPad too.\n\nXoom has the Android Honeycomb OS. Being that it is brand new it has few things to be worked out. Biggest beef people have is the SD slot disabled. Rooted Xoom's sport a fix for that already. The systems operates with great speed. The screen looks great (IMO). Video players seem to vary. I use Double Twist. Standard iTunes videos do not play well, the frame rate is off. Handbrake fixes that. APPS.... most of the apps I used on my Droid phone works on my Xoom. There are tablet versions and optimized apps. Android tablets should take off as the apps catch up.\n\nCameras... yeah there are 2.

As of now 4.1.2 is the last OS update Xoom will get. Yes I own one. Purchased 6-5-2012 from another online retailer and updated to ICS out of the box and thru 4.0.3 it was great. Since Jellybean hit its been a downhill slide ending in a shallow grave for what was once the launch platform for the the tablet version of Google's OS. Google OWNS Motorola yet ASUS manufactures the Nexus 7, Samsung the Nexus 10 tablets and the Nexus 4 phone is manufactured by LG. Feel free to search Google for information about the current status of official system updates for this platform. There is a large community of ROM developers for the Xoom but official system updates by the manufacturer and the manufacturer's owner (Google) has stopped.\n\nIt is still a good platform but it is nearing the end. It is still well suited for media / browsing or some games, but that won't last and some high end gfx effects in certain games require a better processor / video chipset already.\n\nI'm hoping Google will put Motorola on developing the next generation on Nexus 10, it would be nice to have some development done here, though not much tech is manufactured on US soil anymore."}

I still use it regularly for personal and work related things.  It takes great quality pictures and video and the Android Market is very robust.  I also love the battery life.  I can use it lightly for several days before needing to charge.

The video and picture quality is great,the sound was  OK ,much better now with a 'speaker boost' app. I have the 4.0.4 android version (updated from honeycomb),I should get the ota Jelly Bean update any time now,I read good things about it. So I got this thing(refurbished) for about 180 bucks,I think it would be a great buy even at 400 bucks. I had this tablet for 6 months now,no problems  at all. ALMOST TWO YEARS LATER(Oct-2014),I LIKE THIS TABLET EVEN MORE.I've been  at Jelly Bean  update for sometime now  and I never had any issues with this tablet,except when I tried to  Root and given my my limited skills  I got in trouble ,the tablet froze and I  had to do a factory reset. As for late I was looking at the Samsung Google Nexus 10 and the only minus seemed to be the lack of an extension slot ,until a Google reviewer suggested an OTG cable to be attached to the the single MicroSd slot. That gave me an idea:why not attach this cable to the Xoom? Will it work?Yes if you can Root the device. Since this approach was out of the question for me,I was looking for a Media Importer that worked with a stock tablet and I found it .I first tried a Media Importer(designed for nexus)supposedly compatible with my  Xoom. I paid $3.99 for it, but it didn't work. Then I found the Total Commander and the USB Stick Plug both  on Google play store ,  both free and now I can play unlimited media volume  from the external OTG cable+USB stick.\n  I also have a 32GB in the Micro  slot, of course  the tablet comes with  a 32GB internal memory .Is this a great tablet or what?

My boyfriend did some research on line and found that this is happening a lot with this product, it's an Asian product that can't be updated, and you have to find an adapter for the cord/plug.  I sent it back to the company for a refund 2 weeks ago and haven't heard anything more yet about it.  The seller said he didn't know anything about it being a different version and to send it back, but still no word. Since this seems to be the case with these tablets a lot, I recommend you get a different type of tablet. It looks fine, but that's all."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I love this tablet so much that I now own two of them.\n\nThe second tablet I ordered came with a different international charging prong and adapter, and It didn't come with flash player installed like the first one did. I had to go to the flash player website to install that manually, it worked fine. I can play Amazon instant videos on it now. I guess the second tablet isn't a US version.\n\nBetween all the tablets that I have tried, Asus tf 101, Archos 101t G9 and Motorola Xoom, the Xoom is miles ahead when it comes to battery life.\n\nI like the screen better on the Archos though, Archos made their screen a little softer, it's easier on the fingers than the Xoom and Asus. When it comes to screen graphics quality, it's a close call, Asus might be the winner there, but the difference is so minimal, I'd prefer the Archos softness.\n\nThe Archos doesn't have a rear cam though, is a lot bulkier...  runs hot (good for cold days), they should advertise it  as \"exclusive integrated left side hand warmer\", the battery runs down more than two-three times faster than the Xoom, and everything runs smoother and faster on the Xoom.\n\nLook and feel;\n\nThe Archos isn't that pretty, and I don't particularly like the feeling of holding it neither.\n\nThe Asus is looks OK and feels nice to hold, even though the metal is textured, it is still slippery, so it is always kept in a case which adds to bulk and weight.\n\nEven though the screen sizes are the same, the Xoom screen fills up a larger part of the tablet, and is physically a lot smaller than the other two. I love the heavy solid feel of the Xoom, just wish it was  lighter in my bag. I love how the upper part of the back plate is rubberized, would be nice if they would have made the whole back plate like that because the metal part is really slippery and cold! Perhaps they wanted the metal there to help it keep cooler.\n\nWith all this said, it might be surprising to find that the Archos actually is the only tablet which I confidently can pick up and carry with one hand, even if I don't like the feeling of that plastic material, it doesn't tend to slip, it isn't the sexiest, but perhaps the most practical while the Xoom to me is the most beautiful and feels like holding a Rolls-Royce.\n\nWhen receiving the Xooms I updated them right away, on the second one I had to update two consecutive updates to get to Android 4.0.4\n\nW00t!  Audible books now saves to the micro SD card on this tablet. Audible just updated their app, nice!\n\nOnce on the first tablet, the system would load and load the M logo, but never fire up, proved to be the SD card, somehow the card popped up by itself, before this happened I was never able to pop the card out although it worked fine while in the tablet. Apparently, the system will not load if the micro SD card is half ways popped in/out, got to be either all the way in or out.\n\nIf this tablet freezes, all you need to do to reset is, hold the power button and then volume up together, (power button+volume down= screenshot). I had to resort to this 3-4 times in a year. Reset won't mess anything up, it's just like a reboot.\n\nLove my Xooms! One of the best things I ever bought. Was never crazy about Motorola until now, I think this is the best product they ever made. Thank you for making this awesome tablet!"}

The protective sheet had been removed, reapplied and was full of scratches.  The box was opened not sealed, the screen had fingerprints all over it, and the twist ties for the cords were barely put back on.  Obviously had been opened/used.  Also they never stated that model M601 is the ASIAN version and comes with the European power cord.  I called Motorola and they said the Warranty expired a year ago, and they told me it was the ASIAN model and could never be repaired her in the US, because of different parts.  Amazon tried to refund me 10% which was only $39, when I could get a used one for $100-$150 less.  I wanted new, I thought I bought new.......RETURNED!!!"}

The charger slot  should be on the top of the unit not the bottom. Some games will not move up and down or side to side.\nThis makes it hard to use when the charger is on. Children especially have a hard time and tend to bend the prong.

I'm so glad I didn't. I get a variety of newspapers, CNN, crossword puzzles, kindle and nook, games for me, games for my grandson.  I have loaded the xoom and the memory card with movies and TV shows that I know I will enjoy rewatching, and it's so easy to take them off and load new ones if I change my mind.  If I miss NCIS, I can watch it on tv.com.  With a mini-hdmi cable, I can hook it up to my TV and watch there. It holds hours of music and albums' worth of photos and movies of my loved ones. Probably best of all, it bings to let me know that my son is on Facebook.  (As he is overseas, that is a vital feature.) And I think, because I had to work so hard to figure it out, I have confidence in my ability to use it. It's not perfect.  Customer support is lacking.  And it's heavy. And maybe all the tablets do what this one does -- if they have expandable memory. But this is a solid piece of good technology that has served me well.  I wouldn't trade it."}

I looked up into on this online and I guess Adobe decided to stop supporting the Android applications. But Flash is pretty old anyway, and I haven't had too many issues with the lack of Flash (games work great!)\n\n***Xoom has been discontinued from what I understand, and replaced with the large Razor version. If you own an Android phone, you will LOVE this tablet! Works better than your phone! Sound quality is NOT as good as your Motorola Razor MAx, but still good.\n\nPS____ I bought mine on Ebay refurbished and saved $100. Looks brand new!\n\nBottom line:\n\nWorth the price.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Mine is Wi-Fi only. I use it to display maintenance documents in areas where I don't have access to a computer where all the docs are stored. So I have them downloaded onto the Xoom. I had two main criteria when I went shopping for a 10 inch tablet. It had to take my Micro SD card that already had my documents on it. It also had to charge through a port that was NOT a micro or mini usb. The last tablet I had, a seven inch from another company, charge through a micro usb. When the plastic guide inside the port broke, the unit became useless, no charging. The company would only sell me a replacement motherboard, for the price of a new unit. This unit, like the Xoom had been dropped a number of times, but it showed the damage, so no warranty work allowed.\n\nThe Xoom was the only tablet on the market that fit these two criteria. The case that it resides in protects it very well. Mine has been dropped from as high as 5 feet, and the case did very well protecting the Xoom. No damage at all. The camera works nicely, in either photo or video mode, so I can take photos of damaged equipment wherever I am.\n\nIt has a very nice and long battery life. With the appropriate applications, it displays all the documents and spreadsheets that I need it to, regardless of document type. It's easy to hold, works very well in everything that I try to do with it. It also connects to my desktop flawlessly. If I trash this one, which will be a difficult thing to do, I'll certainly get another one, as no other tablet will match my selection criteria, plus be tough enough to handle the environment I use it in. A great system all the way around for my use in a non home environment. I can't speak highly enough of this unit. Great."}

Adobe says that they don't support flash on the Xoom anymore, but if you look around on the interwebs, you can easily find a copy of the Adobe Flash 11 APK and throw that on your Xoom! You might be thinking \"So what, Big freaking deal! My Ipad has YouTube\". Yeah, but is your Ipad capable of loading Flash websites? NO! Can your Ipad play videos from other sites like Vimeo without the App? NO! My Xoom was advertised stating that it came with the Ice Cream Sandwich operating system, but I was delighted to recieve it with JellyBean 4.2.1.\n\nAnother benefit is the build. The build quality is excellent. Yeah, it's a little beefy, but that's ok. It's better than carrying a laptop or...Netbook! (Remember those? So Last Year!) I dropped my Xoom from 4 feet TWICE and it was perfectly fine. It is built with GorillaGlass, so your screen might not shatter that easily!\n\nCONS: A minor con is that you have to wipe off the screen ever so often because it attracts finger prints.

I purchased this when it first appeared on the market in March 2011. All-in-all, I was quite pleased with the versatility. I purchased the model with 4G capabilities, thus spent $799 on the product. Well, it just simply stopped working (likely something with the power port), I would have liked it to be fixed, but apparently the vendor wasn't interested in dealing with the problem. Thankfully, I had a Protection Plan on it and was refunded my entire purchase price plus the pro-rata portion of the remaining protection plan. Had I not protected my interests, it would have been a very expensive tool having only lasted about 20 months. I'm not thinking I will purchase another..... but will not go to the dark side either.

Options are where this Xoom tablet by Motorola really shines.\n\nIf your like me, you probably own media content with several different providers. I love Amazon prime, and have built quite a collection of content through Amazon, including books, magazines, movies, and music. That said, I use Google services for most productivity applications, including gmail, contacts, calendar, and documents through drive. The Xoom is the only tablet that I have owned, or researched for that matter, that allows for absolute full access to both my Amazon and Google services.\n\nAll Google services are completely integrated into the tablet, as Motorola is now owned by Google. Amazon apps, such as kindle and MP3, work flawlessly. Additionally, the tablet version of the Amazon mobile website, as well as Amazon instant videos (including prime videos), play flawlessly through the stock Xoom web browser. I downloaded the Chrome app to sink my bookmarks and search, and the chrome browser will not play Amazon instant videos. But the stock browser plays them without lapse or any buffering.\n\nIf you're looking for a affordable, nicely equipped, versatile tablet, that will not make you choose between the ecosystems of Amazon and Google, than I highly recommend this tablet. For the record, neither the Google Nexus 10, or the Amazon Kindle Fire HD, can offer access to the amount of content that the Xoom tablet can offer. This is a FACT!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Below is a review of several tablets I tried with explanations of why I rejected those that I rejected and why I finally decided on the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet in the end. I am placing the same review under each model I tried.\n\nBackground - I am now 65 - NOT a member of the electronic generation! I love playing Scrabble and thought intensive games in general. My adult daughter also loves Scrabble and I was seeking a way to be in daily contact with her. I am sufficiently computer knowledgeable to successfully assemble and operate my own from spare parts, but when I began this odyssey, I knew NOTHING about smart phones or tablets. Finally, I firmly believe that a company OWES SUPPORT to their consumers and NOT at additional cost! Customer service is VERY important to me! Before anyone accuses me of bias: I have NO connection to ANY of the companies mentioned. I am simply a consumer relating my personal experiences!\n\nMy first foray into these devices was a first generation iPhone. I bought it shortly after experiencing a heart attack. Until that cardiac event, I never thought to carry a cell phone with me all the time. AFTER the event, I NEEDED the psychological comfort of knowing I could call for help from anywhere. At that time, the iPhone was in its second iteration, but I bought the first generation to save some money. It is a SPECTACULAR device that does all sorts of awesome things. Sadly, it does not function well as a telephone! What was worse, for me, was that making an emergency call took too many steps. While my cardiac experience was not like this, friends have told me about theirs: one was barely able to rip open an aspirin container to gulp down a dose! Going through the necessary steps to make a call on the iPhone may have been impossible for him! I forwent the iPhone for a standard \"dumb\" flip phone.\n\nI then bought a first generation iPad shortly after the iPad 2 came out, again to save money. I found NO manuals for the device, the software, or anything usable to a novice with the product. Somehow, I managed to upload a few of my own photos to the iPad. One, a VERTICAL photo of a windmill, appeared on the iPad HORIZONTALLY. I downloaded the free Photoshop app and easily rotated the photo. HOWEVER, when I tried to remove the original, horizontal version, I found NO trash can/no delete button. NO WAY to remove it. By this time, I had owned the iPad for perhaps 92 days. I searched their web site for a solution with NO luck. I searched the web for an answer with NO luck. I called 1-800-applecare and quickly learned that Apple does NOT care about their customers! I was told that since I was beyond the 90 day free support period I would need to PAY for an answer! The techie told me to search their web site (which I had already done), and then told me to go to their user forums - maybe someone else had found the solution (I had TRIED to do so). When I BEGGED the customer \"support\" techie to direct me at NO CHARGE to a location on their web site where I would find the answer he reluctantly gave me directions to a place that did NOT help at all. I then went to an Apple store and spoke to a few of their \"geniuses.\" NONE of the three or four \"geniuses\" had a clue! EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED, I returned the iPad and was LUCKY to receive a FULL refund. BTW, I did FINALLY find the answer from another user - NO THANKS to Apple! You need to go back to the folder on your PC from which you originally downloaded the photo file to the iPad; DELETE the file from that folder, connect the iPad and sync it using iTunes (at least back then, software with ZERO documentation in any form in any location that I could find). Contrast this with connecting an Android based tablet directly to your PC via a USB port and accessing the Android based tablet as a removable drive, easily adding or removing images, music, video or any other kind of file that you want!\n\nBut I still wanted to be able to play Scrabble with my daughter over the \"ether.\" I bought a first generation Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet. This device runs Android 2.3. It is now several years old and STILL functions perfectly. The battery stills holds an all day charge with moderate usage. I have never found an app that is \"incompatible\" with this model. This is an important point in the reviews that follow. I even used it to shoot surprisingly excellent videos of a music/dance presentation in a dimly lit auditorium.\n\nNow, several years later, with cataracts growing in both eyes as well as \"floaters\" in both eyes, I was seeking a screen larger than the 7 inch. I read MANY reviews; both user and professional. MANY Amazon.com customers provide wonderful, useful, information in their comments. I also read many professional reviews on techie web sites.\n\nBased on everything I read, and trying to save some money, I bought a Motorola Xoom 10.1 tablet. As other reviewers have observed, it is HEAVY. While it worked well, for reasons unknown to me it was not compatible with several of my favorite apps. Furthermore, the screen seems to get greasy very quickly! I sold it to someone who had lost theirs.\n\nSince I had been so pleased with the Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet, I tried the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. At the time, it was $350. It performed as well as the 7 inch tablet until I tried to download the QuickMark app to scan bar and QR codes. The Google PlayStore advised that the app is incompatible with the tablet. I asked the app developer who advised that the tablet does NOT have an \"autofocus\" rear facing camera. Since the first generation 7 inch tablet does, I could not believe that Samsung would have omitted this feature. A phone call to Samsung tech support, and YES - Samsung BELIEVES in customer support at no extra charge!, confirmed this to be the case. If I wanted this feature, I needed to buy the next generation Samsung Galaxy NOTE 10.1 inch tablet. At the time, there was about a $200 difference in price between the two models. I did NOT want to spend that much. I returned the Samsung Galaxy 2 and shopped around a bit.\n\nI read many reviews favorable to Asus tablets, although all noted likely manufacturing defects like loose or poorly seated glass and spastic operating system problems. I next bought an Asus TF300 Transformer 10.1 inch tablet. Upon setup, the tablet immediately upgraded from Android Ice Cream Sandwich to Jellybean (I have NO knowledge of the differences but assume that the next generation OS is improved in some way(s)). While the construction of mine was solid, all the negative comments of other reviewers were immediately apparent. The tablet would not maintain wi-fi contact even close to my router. The Asus TF300 was also incompatible with many of my favorite apps. Finally, the Asus TF300 (and TF700 mentioned below) has a strange auto-spelling correct system that FREQUENTLY screwed up my typing. To their credit, Asus did answer my question with instructions on how to turn it off, but only via email. They have NO telephone tech support. It, too, was returned!\n\nAt this point, I bit the bullet and paid the price for the Samsung Galaxy NOTE 10.1 inch tablet. While it offers a pull out writing stylus AND a rear facing autofocus camera, I saw little difference between it and the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. In short, although it performed well, I did not feel it was worth the difference in price. I had read many reviews of the Asus TF700 Transformer INFINITY 10.1 inch model which is said to have screen resolution approaching that of the latest iPad \"Retina\" iteration. Furthermore, it was selling for roughly the same price as the Samsung Galaxy NOTE 10.1 tablet. I bought the Asus TF700 Transformer Infinity and was certain that I had FINALLY arrived at a tablet that would make me happy. NOT! The Infinity suffers many of the same problems as the less expensive TF300 model. SPASTIC OS, intermittent wi-fi disconnection. The auto-brightness control also appeared not to work or not to work properly. Perhaps worst of all, possibly because of the increased resolution (the improved resolution was NOT apparent to MY eyes - it appeared to me about the same as all the other tablets) the device is incompatible with MANY apps! It, too, was returned.\n\nIn the end, I repurchased the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet on the basis that I do NOT carry the tablet with me when I go shopping and am NOT very likely to ever scan Bar or QR codes with it. In the time since my original purchase of the tablet, the price had dropped $50! However, I did download a different QR code app that DOES work on the tablet, even without the autofocus ability! I have now had the tablet for a week and am loving it. SO FAR, I have not found any incompatible apps other than QuickMark. I find the screen to be bright and sharp (auto brightness works well), and the contrast to be superb. I have used it to watch Big Bang Theory via the TBS app (to view full episodes of available TBS shows, you must subscribe to some cable service that provides TBS - this is independent of your tablet, or wi-fi connection). The Samsung maintains strong wi-fi connection both anywhere in my home and at the school where I attend classes. Other than the lack of autofocus in the rear camera and the lack of direct USB connectivity without their proprietary cable (sadly, this lack of standardization is still common amongst tablet manufacturers), I have absolutely no complaints at this time.\n\nIF you do not need or can live without a rear camera that autofocuses (it DOES have a rear camera and a front camera for SKYPE and other functions), I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy 2 10.1 tablet. At the current price of $300 for the wi-fi 16GB model (memory is expandable through a micro SD card. I see no need for a 32GB model), it is VERY reasonable! I think there are also cell phone service compatible models at additional cost.\n\nAdvice to tablet shoppers:\n\n1 - Buy from a source that allows easy returns without restocking fees. Amazon is EXCELLENT for their customer service, but you may want to buy from a local store to avoid shipping time and costs. Buy from a source that does NOT charge a restocking fee AND allows a reasonable time for device trial.\n\n2 - Download as many apps that are free and that look appealing to you.  Try each one at least briefly.  I love word games and highly recommend Hanging with Friends (Zynga), Hangman (a solo game - Spice apps), Classic Words Solo (Scrabble versus your CPU - Sebastien Leclerc), 3D Words (Arb Studios) and Dropwords (Ben Garrett).  I WOULD recommend Scrabble, but it is seriously flawed at the moment (11/30/2012) and is NOT working.  EA, current owner of the rights to the electronic version of Scrabble, provides NO WAY for direct customer contact/customer support.  NOTE any apps that are not compatible with the tablet you are testing.  How important are they to you?\n\n3 - Look at each screen under bright and dim lighting. How do YOU find the brightness (usually adjustable, if auto-brightness does not work well for you), the contrast, the sharpness?\n\n4 - Log into your email account and/or create a Gmail account. Type an email to someone. Does the auto spelling correct work well for you? Is the virtual keyboard suited to your style and needs?\n\n5 - Play with the tablet for a whole day, if you can afford the luxury of sitting with it on. See how long the battery lasts."}

Easy to carry, easy to use, plenty of apps to do almost anything under the sun, very reliable, fast (not as fast as the new Quad Core tables but plenty for me), great graphics, fantastic display, movies look real and perfect with the HD display, sound is good (use external speakers is better), connects to the TV with HDMI, WiFi is fast. Cons, need a keyboard and I got one blue tooth for it and it is just great. Also get the leather case that doubles as a stand, it is much better than laying it flat on the desk or lap. Also get OpenGarden blue tooth app from opengarden.com which will allow it to connect to your cell phone when you don't have a WiFi or don't want to surf using the company PC :). You need OpenGarden on your cell and tablet. I am in heaven. I got a refurbished one and I have no issues what so ever. Get it."}

The Frustating part was that getting Video onto the Xoom was not easy because you had to reformat dvd video files to fit xoom/google (I got some good software for that a month later).  Since then I use my XOOM daily because Google unlike Pear (you know that fruit company) gives you alot more Free apps and with a 10.1 inch screen it is very easy to see.  My 2 year old daughter also uses it almost everyday for an app called Istory books that reads her bed time stories everynight (i know you are looking down on me for not reading them myself).  It also is a life saver when going out to meals because i can pop on a movie or cartoon and she is not bouncing off the walls as much.  I think the Xoom is a great product but want people to know it takes a couple days of really playing with it to get use to the controls and I don't really love the charging plug in cord so i suggest the docking station."}

Since the XOOM is Google written Android and Google's way is familiar to most of us, I prefer the XOOM.  I have Google's Chrome and there are no surprises with the XOOM.  Add to all of that I have a Verizon Motorola Bionic. There are lots of apps available for free. So the XOOM is already familiar.  There is a slot for inserting a micro SD card and it works very well.  I found from the start that the I-Pad did things differently and felt uncomfortable using it.\nNow the Cons: (1)The little plug in the bottom of the unit is for charging.  It seems a bit flimsy. 2) The sound is lacking when compared to the I-pad.  I would welcome better sound since I am at an advanced age and hearing is difficult for us guys."}

The condition was as promised, so pretty happy with that. The tablet itself is not as snappy as one would expect from a one gig processor.

Needless to say I had to setup that device as well.  I can tell everyone that the display on the iPad is really nice, but the operating system is clunky compared with Icecream Sandwich, Android 4.0.  Admittedly, I am an Android user even with my phone and TV, but I also have iPods and other Apple devices.  Using the iPad irritates me...best way I can put it in short.  The Xoom on the other hand seems second nature, its built solidly, has nice interfaces with no add on dongles like the iPad.  I personally love the Xoom and take it everywhere I go...I now have a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse for when in a hotel room and travelling, never even take my laptop.

Nothing there that isn't wanted and a blank slate for a new owner. I used moms Google back-up from her phone and it loaded the basics of her profile into the tablet.

To sum up, buying a refurb is like buying a used car, just smaller.\n\nHere are some of the problems I had with my Xoom.  Thankfully for me, they were all fixable:\n\n1. One of the speakers buzzed badly when I played any sounds.  Long story short, I bought a replacement (pull-out) speaker from a seller on Ebay for about $6 plus shipping, plus a T5 Torx driver that enabled me to open the case.  Check on YouTube for a good video that shows how to disassemble the Xoom, it's not that hard or scary.  The replacement speaker is brilliant!\n2. The \"drawer\" for the SIM/SD card is missing, apparently the refurb outfit pulls them and tosses them.  The kind folks at Motorola sent me a replacement at no charge, but it took the rep a bit to find it in their system.\n\nThere was no cable in the package, other than the power cube.  No USB, no HDMI.  If you want to hook it up to your PC or TV you'll need one or both of these.  Not expensive, just more to do and pay for.\n\nThe good news is that that's it for my problems.  Thankfully I didn't get one of the non-US ROMS, so the ICS push worked fine.  And the unit itself is unmarred, no scratches.\n\nMy guess is that the prior owner returned it because of the bad speaker.  I'm pretty handy so this was no big deal.\n\nI was relatively lucky.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have been using the Xoom for quite a bit now (over 6 months) and I'm confident that I have see most of its features as well as limitations. Since the most useful review was back in April 1, (makes you wonder, huh?) 2011, I want to give an update with the new Android OS 4.1 Jelly Bean (JB).\n\nOS:\nCompared to Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS), the previous 4.0 OS, JB is a lot smoother. The transition between the screens is smoother without glitch. However, when I flip the Xoom to vertical mode, the performance drops dramatically. The Nexus 7, which I borrowed from a friend, does not have this issue, so I assume that the difference is due to the aging components of the Xoom.\n\nBrowser:\nAdobe stops flash support for JB, but it's easy to go online and find fix. Other than this, videos play flawlessly. In terms of performance, i.e. scrolling up and down, Google has done a terrific job from Honeycomb. It's very smooth and responsive now. Multitasking is also easy with true tabbed browsing. Android beats iOS on this by far.\n\nApp market (aka Play Store):\nThere's a lot more android apps now, especially those optimized for tablets. Google even has an app section specifically for tablets.\n\nGoogle Now:\nWith this new feature in JB, you can command the Xoom to display the weather, traffic, google something, send a self note to your own gmail. I'm not a fan of \"speaking to your electronics\" but I find it useful and fun to use.\n\nOther things that many other users have mentioned repeatedly: customization, widgets, microSD slot now unlocked (supports up to 32 GB), flexibility (no need for PC), ease to use with computer. The camera is better than iPad2. I can really the difference between the images. Screen display. The two speakers in the back are surprisingly  decent. They are not top of the line but I can appreciate the sound. Since the Xoom has its own charging port, it takes a short time to charge (I don't pay attention to the actual time but it's so noticeably fast that I have to mention it). The battery generally lasts about 8-10 hours now with JB. I used a juice saver app, which increases the time to about 15 hours continuous use (music, browser, reading). The glass screen is tough (please don't try to scratch it).\n\nSome setbacks:\nIts age. The volume buttons are very hard to press. It's heavy (which may be fine to some but I use my Xoom for reading so it's a negative for me). It took me a day or two to get used to be interface of android, but now I really love it. It does not cook me breakfast.\n\nHope this gives you a more up-to-date review. Xoom for the win! Cheerios!"}

We purchased another Xoom that came from Unlocked cell Phone kings, Inc in March. Last week, after trying to update the OS with the new ICS pushed by Android, the Xoom became unusable - cannot boot up, cannot reset, it tries to boot until it runs the battery down. As we are still within the warranty period, we contacted Motorola and were told this was a Malaysian product and not supported by USA Motorola, and after finally getting thru to the Malaysian Motorola support, we found out the warranty is not honored because Unlocked Cell Phone Kings, Inc. is NOT an authorized seller of their product. We contacted Unlocked Cell Phone Kings, Inc. who pretty much told us, \"too bad - Amazon did the fulfillment, your issue is with them, not us\".\n\nLuckily Amazon has agreed to take over the dispute since the product was misrepresented on the web site, and nowhere did the fact that it was a Malaysian product not supported by either USA Motorola nor Malaysian Motorola display.\n\nUnfortunately, we've discovered that we are not the only ones who have had this happen.  Would Unlocked Cell Phone Kings, Inc. simply been forth-right with us, we would've elected to wait until the US version of the product was available, and not have complained.  Instead, they mislead us and and are trying to point the fingers at Amazon."}

I went with the xoom after a month of searching and comparing because it was a very solid higher end tablet and my laptop was on the way out.  the xoom has a high def (barely) rear 5 mp video camera as well as a 2 mp front camera (great for skyping).  both cameras work quit well and i have no complaints about them the rear camera has a really bright flash and I use frequently as i have a toddler.  Speaking of which the rugged design has come in very useful since he likes to drop it on the floor and otherwise bang it around.  It has an aluminum case and gorilla glass front so no cracking or scratching (we have laminate over concrete floor).  The 32 gig memory means I have plenty of mem left (20) after installing 36 programs.  The graphics are fantastic games play very smoothly.  I use the wifi exclusively and have xfinity 15 meg internet.  It is verizon enabled I just don't subscribe.  Videos play well.  Overall it is very responsive to my needs.  I purchased this refurbished for $351 and got square trade 3 yr warranty for $83 so I ended up with better warranty for a cheaper price then buying new.  Also the battery life on this is fantastic!  I can play a game for over 7 hrs before it says I should plug in (screen on game actively played) also I never turn wifi off so it is constantly sending, receiving and updating while playing games.  The only real drawback for me is the power cord.  It is bottom center so you can't rest the device on you while reading or playing certain programs.  (some programs don't change screen orientation).  So to sum up great value higher end tablet that is very rugged and versatile."}

However, my trust in Amazon and their third-party sellers has been greatly damaged.\n\nI purchased this tablet under the assumption I would be receiving a new, untouched product. Nowhere in the product description did it mention the product's actual condition.\n\nUpon receiving the tablet today, the first thing I noticed was that it had been obviously very used. No attempt was made to make it look less used than it was. No screen protective sticker. Finger prints all over the screen. The back of the tablet was scuffed.\n\nMy curiosity then got the best of me, which was the definitive straw breaking the camel's back.  I called Motorola to investigate the item's serial number. It took the young man at Motorola a few attempts and a supervisor to track the history of the tablet because he was under the assumption he was looking for an item sold in the United States. Funnily, he learned that was not the case at all. Not only was this tablet in his words \"pretty old\", but it was also sold in SINGAPORE!\nWhy is this an issue, you may ask? Operating systems are native to their home. Therefore, a product sold in America cannot natively accept, say, European updates. Thus, this Singapore product is unable to be updated in the United States. Oh, yes, I could root it and such. But why should I have to?\n\nIs the update necessary? If you want to be able to use the MicroSD extension slot, YES! Tons of system and hardware updates came with Ice Cream Sandwich.\n\nLessons learned: Beware buying from third-party sellers. You could end up with an already-enjoyed useless paperweight."}

I had to put a lot of thought into what tablet I would buy and this was the choice for me.\nAt first it was absolutely horrible to own and I thought I would return it. It was slow, everything was crashing, couldn't download apps or do much of anything at all and the interface was kinda gross.\nThen I found out there was an update to 4.1 Ice Cream Sandwich available, took it, and the tablet is pretty much perfect now.\nThe speakers are fantastic, the screen is beautiful and the size and weight are just perfect for me. I do think it's annoying that it doesn't charge from microusb but I guess it doesn't matter as long as I have the right charger. And it doesn't have a USB port, but what you can get is a male mircousb to female usb port and you could use any usb device you want.\n\nMore on a later date, maybe after a week of having it. But so far I love it. I'm listening to music on my tablet speakers rather than my desktop speakers (which I think are amazing), because they're better.\n\nEdit: 9/18\nSo. I got this for myself and I got my mom a  Nexus 7 for her birthday. I got this because I felt like I would like it better.\nI'm stll standing by my \"perfect\" judgement. The only things that bother me about it are the fact that neither camera is as good as even the one on my phone (I have an HTC inspire) and that it doesn't charge by microUSB (that would be great).

I generally love Apple products but the new Android (ICS or Jelly Bean) are great. The Xoom is more flexible in the ability to add and move files like PDFs and ebooks. It is recognized as a drive by a regular computer. You don't need to go through iTunes. A big benefit is that you can use the Amazon App store and get their free app of the day. This in combination with the Google Play store provides a lot of access to apps. Generally, it performs equally to the original iPad. A nice bonus is that settings let you really get into the guts of the operating system and manage it as you desire...if you wish to do so. Mine came with ICS and was upgrade to Jelly Bean for free. Plays the most current apps and games. It is decent to good in viewing the internet. Videos from youtube or crackle play really well. Screen is sensitive and easy to use as is the virtual keyboard. Screen sharpness is comparable to the original iPad. Minimal time to get up and running, slightly more difficult then iPad to pick up and get going, but minor. Biggest issue, it's a bit heavy. It has made my laptop feel sad and lonely."}

I used to carry a Samsung Android phone (the Galaxy S2), and updates were promised, but rarely came. Support is big. Google Now is a really cool feature, and is only available with Jelly Bean.\n - Performance is quick. The menus are snappy and I haven't noticed any lag. I use it for Internet, Netflix, and some applications (no gaming).\n - Camera quality is decent, although I will probably never use them.\n\nCONS:\n - Weight...this thing is a tank. I appreciate the build quality, but it's much, much heavier than the iPad.\n - Screen quality is...eh. It's definitely not as sharp as other tablets out there. It's not terrible...it's merely serviceable.\n - I also wish it charged via microUSB for convenience. Just another charger I have to lug around.\n\nOverall, I think the Xoom is a pretty worthy tablet. I've also used the Samsung Galaxy series tablets, and I'd choose the Xoom over them."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have now had this tablet for a full year now, and I have to say I love it.  It's contoured metal back in comfortable to hold, and the 10.1\" screen is an excellent size.  When I first got it, it was running Android 3.0 Honeycomb, the Android OD designed especially for tablets.  What I really loved about it was how fast it is.  Comparing it to a friend's iPad, this was clearly faster from everything to turning on to web browsing.  The touch controls are excellent and precise, which makes operating the tablet a breeze.  And now that Android 4.0 has been released, this already great tablet is now even better.  The camera now runs much faster, with pictures being able to take the moment you press the button, versus having to wait the two seconds it did before on Android 3.0.  My favorite feature however is hands down the callender.  In 4.0 the callender is simple, yet ellegant.  I can scroll through in a multitude of views to see what I have to do for the week.  The only complaint that I have about this tablet is the charging cable.  It has a standard microUSB port for data only. For charging, it uses a proprietary charging port, which feels like it will snap if you mishandle it while charging.  Other than that, this tabled is definately worth the buy.\n\nPro's:\n-Screen size\n-Speed\n-Android 4.0\n-Portable\n-Practicality\n\nCon's:\n-Proprietary charging port."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I am writing this review on my Xoom tablet, which is now running Android 4.1.1, also known as \"Jelly Bean\" (for those that don't know, this tablet is now able to receive the stock OTA 4.1.1 update). I primarily use this tablet for reading, browsing, Netflix, music and movies, although email and the game apps have improved by leaps and bounds...and the Zoodles Kid Mode app is a godsend for tablet users who have little kids :-)\n\nI have run this tablet on 3.2 Honeycomb, 4.0.4 ICS, and now on 4.1.1, and I must say that even though the experience was a bit rocky with 3.2, it has only gotten better! It has improved to the point that my laptop is pretty much always put away, in favor of this medium, which has awesome battery life (in comparison), and is also far more portable.\n\nFor those frustrated with slow scrolling speeds in the Netflix app (which was a major complaint for me), Jelly Bean actually fixes that. On ICS, you apparently had to Force 2D rendering in the developer settings to make it smoother.\n\nThe tablet keyboard now functions smoothly, and (at least on mine) the scrolling smoothness rivals that of the iPad 2, which was this tablet's direct competitor at release.\n\nFact is, unless you are willing to shell out more than 500 bucks for a 10.1 inch tablet, this one has the overall best build quality, and doesn't have as much in the way of bloatware or altered interfaces. Unlike with my droid phone, I have not felt the need to root the device for optimization, or use ADW to make the launcher look/function better.\n\nIf you want something completely intuitive, with little to no setup, and don't mind being restricted to iTunes, an iPad is probably best for you. If you don't mind doing a bit of exploring in the OS, and want an experience that isn't as restrictive, then Android may be the better way to go. With JB, this tablet is a great buy.\n\nWatch out for grey market sellers. Personally, Warehouse deals, while not always the lowest price, is probably best. It has never let me down. And don't shy away from refurbished products; mine is one, and it came in the OEM box looking and performing like new :-)\n\n--received XOOM tablet from Woot!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "While it is not the latest cutting edge tablet out there, the 32 GB Xoom tablet is a solid, attractive device capable of handling most all normal applications. It is versatile enough to replace a laptop for those short business trips, operates as a great reader and handles videos well on a good wireless network. The screen resolution is excellent and battery life is sufficient for extended use. Any purchaser intending to double the  storage capacity by installing a micro sd card should note that the XOOM ,as now configured, treats the card as a READ ONLY device even with the Jelly Bean OS. One can download files from a PC to the card but the XOOM will not write or store files to the card. Motorola Support has confirmed this and acknowleged they 'are working on it', what ever that means. This shortcoming seems so ludicrous. I could write to my floppy on my old 8086 PC and even my Droid Razor allows me to easily transfer files from internal storage to the removable sd card. I've read several reviews that indicate other 'work-arounds' for this shortcoming, though. Even programs written for tablets such as Quick Office Pro HD, will not allow storage on the card and, in fact, function incorrectly if the card is in place. Quick Office indicates they too 'are working on it'. Lesson- don't have a card installed if you are using this or other such programs. The app works correctly and stores to the internal storage of the XOOM with the card removed, however.\n\nThere are more, varied apps available than I would ever use so the available volume of 'I-PAD' Apps is of no consequence to me and if the sd card was writable, I'd easily give the device another star, perhaps more."}

Eventually, I investigated why it wasn't getting the promised update.  We discovered that this Xoom was actually an Asia/Pacific model, sold in the United States.\n\n-- On top of that, we've been shafted a bit on the warranty on the device as it shows as expiring in August, 2012 at Motorola rather than November... since the device was purchased on November.  There was never a disclaimer or statement from the seller that this was NOT a U.S. model or that the warranty was not for the full year.\n\nNote to other buyers of products that could be released to outside US markets...\n\nMake sure the product you are going to receive is intended for release in the U.S.  If not, you will be frustrated by a lack of update support and possibly technical support of your product.\n\nIf I'd realized this when it was received, I would have gone straight to Amazon to lodge a complaint on the seller.

I am extremely glad with my decision, and would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a decent Android device. It's fast, runs well, and has practically replaced my laptop. I use it for almost everything now. Of everything, the battery life impressed me the most. I used it for over fifteen hours right out of the box. It continues to have exceptional battery life, and I've had no troubles with it thus far."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "July 27\nwanted to update my review, after 20 days of having this tablet and easily flashing the US firmware to it after i bought it i just received the over the air update to Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean! The Motorola Xoom is one of the very first Android devices to receive this upgrade and it is (as Google says) smooth as butter!! It does everything i want and does not get in my way. i have rooted it, flashed custom ROMs, put it back to stock firmware, received OTA updates, everything.\n\nthe charge last forever. there is a bit of glare even after i put a zagg invisible shield on it. and one thing i really don't like (and this is the ONLY thing) is the rear facing speakers. they sound good, but they just fire away from you so you have to turn it up or cup your hands behind them to get the sound to come forward\n\nother than that, i'm very pleased with this tablet!\n\n-----------------------------\nJuly 7\nwell first of all even though this is my first tablet, it is not my first Android device. i have two Android phones in the house that i tweak and modify all the time and a Kindle Fire.\n\nso for the Xoom - i ordered this thing less than 24 hours ago and selected Saturday delivery and already have it! cannot say enough about how quick i received this, shipped from Indiana to NC in less than a day using UPS...who would have thought :)\n\nit seems to be an older Xoom as it still had Honeycomb 3.01 on it. first thing i did was update it to 3.1, and now it is downloading the next update, hopefully it will be ICS. It also seems to be an Asian model as the language and time were set to Singapore. and there is a sticker on the back that says it is valid to use in Singapore. not sure if that even matters, especially after it gets all the updates.\n\nthe box it came in, while original, may have been resealed. the clear protective film on the back of the Xoom looks like it has been reapplied, it has a couple of big air bubbles in it that i would not expect from the factory. i'm really hoping this is not a refurbished model. it didn't say it was, but who knows.\n\nanother clue to not being a US model is the charger. the plug is either Europe or Asia but i don't know which, and comes with an adapter for US outlets. that then plugs into a transformer which plugs into the tablet with such a small connector i'm sure i will break one of these days. the cord is also a little longer than i would have expected, usually they are too short, but this one seems to be longer than it needs to be, but i'm sure i will be thankful for that sooner or later. the Xoom will not charge via USB so it will be a pain to have to lug three extra pieces around with me to charge it. but hopefully that won't be too often as this should get like 8-10 hours on a charge. i will update this review after a few charges to see how long it lasts\n\nspeaking of that, it came out of the box charged up to about 70% and took no time at all to get to 100% even while doing the updates and rebooting\n\nit is a little heavier and bigger than other tablets but i knew that going in.\n\ni will update this review in a week and probably a few times after that."}

The model number for the tablet is MZ601 , so buy it and enjoy."}

I was disappointed with the condition of the box and the Xoom itself.  The box appeared to be wet and had been opened of which led me to think the item was used and not new as stated.  I purchased this as a gift for someone.  After trying to set up the Xoom and get all the updates, found out that the operating software was for Canada and not the US.  Therefore the updates for Canada are not current with the United States.  Contacted Motorola to find this out from them.  Good thing Xoom still under warranty, had to send to Motorola for them to update the pad.  Now I am waiting to get the pad back from Motorola.  This makes me very cautious of purchasing from this company again."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I've had my Xoom for roughly a year now and I really don't have many complaints. I'm the type that adopts technology early on, so Android and iOS are both old hat for me. I had been a steady iPad/iPod user, but being the tech geek that I am really wasn't happy with either, even after jailbreaking them. What I was looking for in a tablet was what Motorola was promising in the Xoom: USB/HDMI connectivity, SD expansion, bluetooth, the freedom of Android and ability to use flash.\n\nLike other reviews have pointed out Android, for those not familiar with it, takes time to learn and isn't as intuitive as iOS, but once you know what you're doing it offers far more flexibility than iOS ever will. I love being able to surf and view the entire web, download apps/movies/music at will from whatever site I'm on, create folders, move & edit files, change the layout of my device and all without ever having to connect to my computer. Surfing and general use has been smooth and quick, but not lightning fast. It will easily switch from app to app without bogging down and streaming music and movies has been a breeze. Aside from the above, at home this little bad boy interfaces wirelessly with my laptop, desktop, TV, Playstation, printer, stereo system and security system. Getting certain parts of that set up to fly took more than a bit of know how and patience, but once up and running has worked flawlessly. I do use my Xoom to Skype and though most of the newer tablets have better specs, both cameras in the Xoom perform just fine. I haven't had any real trouble with my Xoom and it's become my main computing device for both home and work. It accompanies me to the hospital every day where I use several apps for reference material and a single app to interface with the hospitals Citrix based system. The ability to review diagnostic imaging and lab results at the bedside with patients has been amazing and I've not run into any major issues. Given all that I do with this tablet on a day to day basis the platform has performed remarkably well and has been very stable. That being said this tablet isn't perfect and I didn't expect it to be.\n\nMy first complaints have more to do with Motorola than the tablet itself. I was very disappointed in the length of time it took to get the SD expansion slot functional and that seems to be a trend with Motorola. They've been extremely slow when it comes to updates for the OS and I've often turned to downloading and installing my own betas, which is unfortunate because ICS would be a nice addition for the masses (I hear it's in the works). My two gripes with the technology are the inability to charge over USB and battery life. The former is due to the fact that I don't believe it was possible to charge over micro-USB at the time this was built. Still it's an inconvenience as I rely so heavily on my Xoom throughout the day that I have had to buy an external USB power source and carry the charger with me to work. Battery life is respectable, around 7-8 hours with heavy use, but it's no where near what Apple gets with the iPad. My last note is that I did upgrade the stock touchscreen keyboard with one off the app store as I found it just wasn't very intuitive when it came to spelling and at times the input was slow and glitchy. Since switching all is well.\n\nEven with other tablets hitting the market since the Xoom I would still recommend it to anyone. At it's current price it's a great little piece of tech to have around and when/if Motorola eventually rolls out ICS it will be even better."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Alright, so I've wanted a Xoom since they came out about a year ago. I was using a Aluratek Cinepal MP4 player with an 8.9 inch screen, so I wasn't willing to downsize to something like the Kindle Fire, which would've been 1.9 inches smaller in screen size. I wanted something easier to use, more power, yadda yadda so when I heard about the Xoom I figured I'd save and get one. Flash forward through several economic annoyances and I finally bought one. I'd never used an Android device before, but I checked Youtube for tutorials on the Xoom and Android in general, so I wasn't totally clueless.\n\nPro's\nBig, has a solid feel to it. It's thinner than I expected, but feels solid.\nAndroid is ridiculously easy to use. Seriously.\nScreen is bright if you set it to brighter levels, and the speakers can get pretty loud, though I have a Bluetooth headset for when I need audio.\nCharges fast. Showed up about 30% charged, and it was fully charged in 2 hours.\nPlug and play with a PC for file transfers, so I was able to jump my music, pics, and some vids over without any serious problems, though I did get popups about possible incompatibility.\nHot swappable, so no need (Or ability) to eject it from USB, just plug, go, then unplug.\n\nCons\nScreen is a fingerprint magnet\nVolume rocker is annoyingly stiff and small\nThe power plug is proprietary and tiny. Know the lead in a number 2 pencil like is used at schools? The plug is seriously that thin.\nMinimal apps pre-installed, though you can watch movies, look at pics, listen to music, and do other basic tasks, plus there's all the google specific apps like maps, mail, and so on.\nHad to create a GMail account to get the bleeping thing setup. Since I've avoided GMail, being forced to use it's annoying, especially since Youtube, apparently also owned by google, let me use my main account.\nWon't connect to my wifi connection. My wifi router is a solid brand, and no one's ever had problems connecting to it before. My mom's used it to surf the internet, my brother to do his net surfing, drivers downloading, even play PS3 games. However the Xoom insists the connection's low powered and slow, so I dunno what's up with that.\n\nOverall, I'm loving the thing. It's exactly what I hoped, and once I can get the apps I need, it'll be perfect. I'd definitely recommend this tablet to anyone not needing a ruggedized tablet, though it does seem pretty durable. Just don't get it then expect a teenager or child to keep it working terribly long."}

I'm afraid to trust another seller but I'm buying it with a gift card so what choice do I have.  I called Amazon before I opened Xoom and over the phone he had me upgrade and it wouldn't, so right away he sent return label and gave me links to make my complaint and returned money before they had the return.  This has not been a fun process. Update: Our Family Values says they gave Amazon NEW US Xooms.\nNow I've finally got the right Xoom.  Ordered from private seller on Amazon, not Fulfilled by Amazon.  A seller I emailed told me all stock(Sellers who send stock to be fulfilled by Amazon) is mixed together and you get what they pick(red box, blue box) from Amazons warehouses. So went with NYC Sales and was very happy-$40 cheaper than everyone else and new and perfect!! Fast shipping also. Now the Xoom is fun! Exactly what I wanted and having a great time with it.

Was very excited when it arrived. I think it was even a day early. After doing my homework for weeks on the tablets out there, I liked the XOOM's specs. The description on the Amazon page said it was new, and upgradable to the newest Android 4.0, the ladder being the nail in the coffin for me, as reviews reported that the 4.0 upgrade really brings the XOOM up to speed with tablets being released today.\nOpened the box, and noticed the \"Universal to American Power Adapter\" that was included in a separate bag in the package. Didnt think much of it, figured they thought of everything, even people who travel!\nSo I fired up my XOOM, and over the 6 weeks I had, I fell in love with it. The tablet is great. Cameras, dual processors, good video, and all kinds of apps.\nAll the time I had it, I kept waiting for my Android 4.0 update to come across the device. I tried forcing it by having it check for updates daily. Reading some forums out there, I saw others who were still waiting for the update. This made me contact Motorola Customer Support a few night ago. After about 5 minutes, and me giving them my serial# on thr device, they told me that I had a Non-US version, and that there was no way at this time for me to get my update because I was in the US, and I had the wrong model.\nNeedless to say, I was pretty unhappy. I wrote Amazon, who quickly took the device back for a refund. (Well, i'm still waiting for the credit, but they said they would) I also inquired about purchasing ANOTHER Motorola XOOM from Amazon, as I have been using them for some time now. My only credit card is an Amazon Chase card. I have been happy using Amazon thus far.\nThe gentlemen from Amazon sent me a link to a XOOM that he \"verified\" to be a US version, from a different Amazon seller. So I went, and checked it out, and added it to my cart (this one also said Android 4.0 compatible). When I went to my cart to checkout, I saw that they automatically added a \"Universal to American Power Adapter\" and this time they even wanted to charge me extra for it!!\nI wrote an email back, and told them of the problem. They apologized, and offered me another link, to another XOOM, and told me again, that this one is confirmed to be a US version.\nWhen I went to this one, it was the same exact one I bought the first time, from the same seller. (A sidenote, I wrote my review of that purchase on the sellers page, but it was removed)\nEach time i've written to Amazon about this (on the same email), i've dealt with a different person, two of which have lead me to more \"grey market\" XOOMs.\nAt the end of the day, I ended up writing back to tell them how shocked I was that they would allow these people to continue selling these items under false descriptions, and to say I just did not feel comfortable shopping on Amazon anymore. I was never bid on the that BIG Auction site because of the scammers on there, I didn't expect it here.\nI ended up getting a new device on another site, and in the reviews, customers are saying how the devices from that place will update to Android 4.0 as soon as you fire them up, so I am confident I will get WHAT I PAY FOR, and what IS DESCRIBED there."}

I have an Android phone that I also like, and it is great to have a phone and tablet in the same Eco-system.  If you have an iPhone then an iPad makes sense.  If you have an Android phone then an Android tablet makes sense.  This let's you learn one OS and share a common set of apps on both.  Why buy two sets of apps?\n\nThe latest update to Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) works great on the Xoom. It is nice that the WiFi XOOM is a Google experience device.  It got ICS very fast and should still see good support. There are a few minor things that can be improved in ICS on the XOOM, but I expect that Google will fix them in an upcoming update.\n\nHaving a tablet has changed how I consume media.  I use ebooks pretty much exclusively now instead of books.  I use the laptop much, much less than I did before.  Most personal computing I want to do I can do on the XOOM.  Sometimes I will use a Bluetooth keyboard if I need to type a lot.\n\nThe XOOM is the same weight as the original iPad it was trying to compete against when it was released, so it is on the heavy side today.  However, add a protective case to most tablets and they all start to feel heavy, so this isn't a big deal to me.  I would prefer a slightly larger boarder for gripping without touching the screen accidentally, but that is just my preference.  Otherwise the build quality is solid and it has held up very well with no screen protector and no scratches observed over these last months of solid use.\n\nIn-app performance is great with the dual core Tegra2 processor. Battery life is good too and it charges fast.  Yes, the charger is proprietary, but that is why it charges so fast. Because this tablet is being replaced by newer ones the accessories and chargers have been clearanced and are very affordable now.\n\nIf you get a good price on the XOOM, it is still a good tablet and it is running the latest ICS update.

You can add NewEgg to the list of past offenders as they sent me a Singapore Xoom that I returned. I see they have now discontinued selling the new Xooms and I give them credit for that. I ended up buying mine directly from Motorola for $499. I did cost more but it came with some free accessories (speaker dock and gel case) and the 2 day shipping was included. Not too bad a deal. It arrived with ICS 4.03 installed and of course was a brand new USA edition Xoom. If you want to avoid the gray market hassle then buying direct from Motorola may be the best bet.\n\nThe Xoom itself is great. There is a learning curve for an old fart like me who has never had a tablet but so far I have been able to figure everything out. The only complaint I have is about tablets and smart phones in general and that is the fingerprint problem. Another very minor thing I noticed is that if you use a live wallpaper it creates a slight lag in CPU performance. Not surprising as the dual core CPU is only 1ghz. I don't care for live wallpaper anyway and I was just experimenting with it. I have had no problems playing videos or music....  As an experiment I watched part of Braveheart on it and it was smooth and in sync. The resolution was pretty good too! I downloaded Astro file manager and it is a great little program.

It was unable to be updated to the latest and the greatest. And it didn't have a US Motorola warranty. I boxed it up and sent it back to Amazon.  Click, click, tape, tape and off it went, no questions asked.  Refund processed.\n\nI then ordered a replacement. I double checked this time and it was listed as a US retail version. However the screen was cloudy and it was as if a puddle of water was under screen.  So, I sent it back. Amazon to the rescue. Boom. Refund processed.\n\nGood work Amazon, way to be a great customer service operation.\n\nI re-ordered, as both of these issues were not Amazon or Motorola's fault.  The next Xoom arrived in perfect shape. Unopened box and marked US retail version. After opening it up and inspecting it to ensure it was in good shape and had the right firmware, it was just a few clicks, then boom, Android updated itself. A few reboots later, a brand new Motorola Xoom Tablet with Ice Cream Sandwich installed.\n\n----------------------\nThis machine is slick. Wow, what a difference a tablet and the new software/firmware can make. I have been an Android phone user for several years and I work for a major cell phone carrier. Technology is no mystery to me.  But I wasn't expecting how nice this thing works. Super fast. Netflix works like a charm. You Tube is great. Angry Birds on a screen this big is really fun.  All the app store and all of the \"Google Play\" apps downloaded quickly and the WI-Fi connected flawlessly.\n-------------\n\nMany other reviews give great advice on the shipper caveats, on the ICS update process and the pros and cons of the device and comparisons between this device and the i Pad. I won't go into detail there.\n\n-------------\n\nMy main advice it so shop around. When looking at customer reviews, first read the newest comments to ensure the shopping experience is still good.  Then read the reviews listed by most helpful to get the best advice.  I always read the one star reviews, as well, to gauge whether the dissatisfaction is the product, or Amazon or an unrealistic expectation."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have read lot of reviews and the comments to them. There is worry about not getting a US version from Amazon sellers.\n*Even if its free ship or prime it can still be coming from a 3rd party seller.\nI saw that masterdeals ripped someone off sending them a Asian version for a US buyer. I sure didn't want that as ONLY the US version at this time can be updated to ICS, the latest OS. So, I went with Our Family Values/Owner Jon Brinton instead via Amazon Prime. *Just look at the 'new' list under the in stock' notification in the ad. There are other sellers using Prime and free ship.\n\nI am happy. Our Family Values send me a new, never opened, USA version of xoom. I immediately updated to ICS. All xoom wifi's can be updated to ICS even if purchased when they first came out. The only way you cant is if your's is some how messed up or its not a US version!\n*Asian xooms come in a red box. Do not open...send back!!! Blue box is US or UK. US build will be Build HWI69. You can find that in the about option in your settings on the xoom. So if you got a blue box but cant update to 4.0.3, ICS, you may have the UK or Canadian version!!! Check the build number!\n\nAs for the xoom review itself. I just got it so I cant say much. I opened it, checked the build to make sure it was a USA version and then, had 66% battery charge on it, I updated it starting with the installed 3.0 then updated to... 3.1, 3.2 and then, 4.0.3, ICS! After than workout I put it on the charger for the first time since I was down to 54% after all the updates and installing them.\nAnother thing I can say is if you want a netbook or laptop, get those. This is a tablet and even though ICS is very useful, its still not a full PC!\n\nI'll revise the review as I work with the xoom as she how she runs.\n\nSo watch the seller, check your build. It should be an OS of 3.0 and build HWI69.\n*To update do not put any new apps on your tablet. Open, set up, and update first! If you have been using it for awhile you have to reset it to factory defaults so it clears data first. Its in the settings. You can back up the data.\n\nOk, I'll be back after I spend some time playing with this xoom. :D\n\nI have been messing around, making it pretty, loading apps, etc. I can say the touch sensitivity is fabulous!! Xoom response is with no effort, no lag. The power button being on the back is actually ok. Its easy to find and feel. Besides, my fingertips are on the back while I'm holding it. She feels solid and well built. The sound is better than I expected for a small device. Her sound beats my netbook and its a nice sound, not tinny. My screen is set to auto and the res and contrast to me is great! First impression...excellent tab, especially with ICS.\nAs for fingerprints, yes she gets them as most do but soon I will have a zag shield (from amazon) on mine. I have a full leather case that won't ever need to be removed as all ports and access are available and it is for tabletop, has stand, and fold over for book like holding.\n\nOh my tab is for homeschooling so the apps are mostly education based, no gaming here. So no review one how she handles games. I did down load Icells. Amazing graphics even on full zoom! Color is spectacular! Xooms response to the 3D viewing is exciting.\nMore to come...\nLast update for now. I have loaded tons of apps and tweaked and played and xoom is still running flawlessly with no slow downs, no lags, no issues at all. In fact it runs better than our pc's, or any other device we have. Its perfection IMO. I am glad I picked the xoom and upgraded to ICS."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "After a week of research looking for the right Android tablet, I decided on the Motoroal Xoom.  The price on Amazon was good along with using some AMX points I got a better price.  Being a PRIME member I selected the free two day delivery and the Xoom showed up next day, fantastic.  This was a early birthday present for ME, so I had to open it and make sure it worked.  I also ordered a leather cover/stand.  The only surprise was that the Xoom label displayed INDIA and the power cord was a 220v but it came with a US 110v adapter.  Connected the adapter and charged the unit.  Once I fired it up and proceeded thru the setup everything is great.  The unit was shipped with Honeycomb 3.01 but it was a snap to download and apply the new upgrades.  I am now running Honeycomb 3.2 which will allow me to access a micro SD card.  I ordered a 32Gig microSD on Amazon which arrive tomorrow.  I will use this to hold music, pictures, Word and .pdf documents (mostly menus for my wife - tablet works great to view on the counter top).  I will use the internal 32Gig for software.  Kindle droid works great and I am also using my Xoom to look at my daily AJC paper.  Games are great, maps, surfing the net, reading, music, pictures, streaming TV and it's it's just a little bigger than my Kindle 3G, which I will still use to read in bed and at the beach. I'm looking forward to using my Xoom for many years to come."}

You don't want a phone in your tablet anyway because with WiFi you can use Skype and other phone emulators.\n\nWhat's really cool this tablet has become the household computer.  We use it to find recipes and refer to it while preparing dinner.  We use it to make video phone calls all over the world.  The front and back camera makes video calls really easy to manipulate.  Often while watching TV, something will be mentioned and I'll want to know more about it.  I just grab the tablet and Google the issue and find what I want while still watching the show.  For example did you know the story of George Melies in the movie Hugo is a true story? Looked it up while watching the movie because the movie, on it's own merit is a bit slow.  When I can't sleep I use it to watch Netflix in bed without disturbing my wife's sleep.\n\nThe tablet has become our truly universal controller, including all entertainment devices but also security system.  It will soon manage lighting and temperature.  Finally it has become the scrabble dictionary for those disputed words.\n\nIt's a great home accessory."}

If you buy an app from the zoom menu and also install the Amazon app store, the Amazon app store will detect the other app example words free with friends. Amazon will then tell you you have an update available for words with my friends free, if you update this app to Amazon longer be able play it games that you have started under the zoom store. This appears to be true with office Pro log me in and other apps. If you load the Kindle apps, you cannot view movies or games from Amazon prime. You also cannot even load the Amazon space direct app you must actually load it as a bookmark in the bookmarks window. You are very familiar with the statement this app is unavailable on your device. Unviewable books in the library include consumers report etc. so beware if you want to use Amazon and other sources there is a conflict set up in the machine. It is seriously more powerful than the fire. The tablet I find it seems to have the least amount problem is the galaxy S for crossover use. However I'm exploring the Windows 7 net books at this time. We have an Asuss 201 series in the house now and it seems to be universally operable. But does require downloading to a computer and then downloading to the Asuss on movies from Amazon. Good block but be careful of this trap of the companies limiting the apps to their own store. I avoid Apple products for exactly this reason."}

Despite this, I got a Droid RAZR for Christmas and fortunately things that I can't get to work on the Xoom work on the RAZR.  I finally got tired of fighting with it to get it to do anything other than playing Angry Birds and gave it away.  A major, major disappointment.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I've actually had the Xoom since last September.  I've finally gotten around to constructing a review.  My reasoning for even getting a tablet of any kind was for school.  I'm enrolled in electronics engineering but it's an online curriculum, so most of the text books are ebooks.  I do a lot of recreational reading so I hate reading theoretical material on my laptops for too long.  Also, I do most of my reading at night so the fan bothers my wife when she's trying to sleep and I'm not a fan of the heat output.  So I was able to trick myself into getting the Xoom.  At the time of my research, I was initially going to get the Samsung Galaxy.  The thing that stopped me was the Xoom had more storage and was like $50 cheaper if I recall correctly.  Also, Samsung and Apple were in their legal dispute.\n\nNow about the actual device.  The internal storage of 32GB is nice; the expansion capabilities are even better.  I love my multimedia so the more the better.  I'm never bored when my wife and I are traveling via bus, train, or plane.  The 1GB of RAM is sufficient for this tablet.  I'm content with the resolution.  Forgive me, but I haven't done any video recording or taken any pictures with this.  I honestly think it would feel pretty awkward doing so.  But I suppose it's good to have these capabilities at your disposal.  I have skyped with my sister who's on a deployment.  The picture is pretty clear, considering it's a tablet and not a laptop or desktop.\n\nBluetooth connectivity is what you would expect.  This allows me to connect to my headphones and do morning cardio on the elliptical with no problems.  The power button being on the back really isn't a problem for me.  But then again, this is my first and only tablet so I'm not really comparing it to anything.  The glare from the screen can be quite bothersome at times.  When I'm traveling by bus to the city it's pretty hard to read.  Also another problem for me is the media players.  I'm using MX video player for the Xoom and my Droid Razr.  No Android VLC yet; still in production.  What's the big deal?  VLC plays mkv no problem.\n\nI downloaded the ICS upgrade when it was available.  There are a few upgrades over Honeycomb.  In my opinion, it wouldn't have been a deal breaker.  This was my first Android driven device so I was impressed from the start.\n\nI won't make this too long so I'll cut it short.  Overall, I'm more than content with this purchase.  I can do all the reading I want at night.  Browsing the internet is faster than I anticipated and the user interface learning curve wasn't as long as I thought it would be since this was my first Android device of any kind.  If you're anything like me, the current lack of VLC compatibility or screen glare might be annoying.  However, don't let it stop you from at least trying this device out.  Especially if you don't want to pay full price for the Xoom 2.  That being said, ask yourself what you plan on doing with this device before you buy one at all.  I've read or viewed reviews on most of them and it usually boils down to personal preference.  I chose the Xoom and I'm very satisfied."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Bottomline: Don't be expecting to be using this right off the bat unless you already have a microSIM card available. A little heavy and some features aren't as nice as the Ipad, but it is much more customizable to fit your particular use for it and offers a lot of flexibility for those who like to tinker. Not for the Android-naive.\n\nWhen I received the tablet, it displayed an error message: Tablet is not provisoned; please insert a SIM card and reboot. There was no way to bypass this. I did not have a SIM card in the country I was at and did not wish to buy one as I would soon be leaving; however, I wanted to make sure that it worked before I left and couldn't return it anymore.\n\nAn hour on the phone with Motorola was no help, as they just kept on repeating to me that there were not unlocked tablets in the US (Motorola has a deal with Verizon). So I was frustrated.\n\nFinally, I was able to get a SIM card (micro sim not mini sim) and use it to set up the device. After that, it no longer requires one to turn the tablet on and it seems to work relatively well.\n\nFrom what I've noticed so far, I like:\n\n1) Pretty intuitive to figure out how to install apps, download pictures, take pictures, e.g. the basic functions IF you are an Android user already. The setup menu was a little difficult to find.\n\n2) Nice graphics. Not that different than the Ipads I've seen.\n\n3) It has front and back cameras, making video chats possible.\n\n4) Adjustable language setting: whatever you pick when you first set-up the device can easily be changed; you aren't stuck with a particular geographic region/language.\n\n5) Doesn't have to be dead-on to see the screen. I haven't used it in daylight yet so I can't speak to this.\n\n6) Syncronization with google accounts is fast and efficient.\n\n7) Lots of screens and space to organize as you please. It's, in general, very customizable to your user interface needs/preferences.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n\n1) No user guide or real help manual was provided (other than a 3 leaflet brochure), so you're dead in the water if you can't figure something out. Motorola customer service leaves much to be desired. If you haven't used Android before, this might be a difficult device to start with.\n\n2) It would be nice if the setup menu had a physical button on the outside or pre-created link to access it, but once you create a shortcut to it, that's not too bad of a hassle.\n\n3) Webcams are about the same quality of a cellphone, so on a larger screen, the image is a bit grainy.\n\n4) It's pretty heavy for something so small. But maybe about the 3rd of the weight of a small 11\" notebook nevertheless"}

Messed around with it and it worked fine but this \"update\" message kept coming up. I ignored it and kept playing around with it. It was rather heavy but nothing I couldn't get used to. I noticed that the screen seemed to become unresponsive at times but would eventually work again. I plugged in the power to refresh the battery and the first thing I noticed is the \"charging light indicator\" never came on......I checked the system settings and the battery was already charged fully. Either this was used or the seller charged it beforehand. The constant update message kept coming up and I just did the update. After it came on it immediately went to the \"New Update Available\" again. I installed it again......re-booted.....\"Update Available again\".......I did it a third time and still the message kept coming up.\nDecided I'd deal with it and just address it later. I turned it off for a few minutes and upon turning it on again it got hung up on the \"honeycomb animation\" for about 5 minutes (just guessing)and eventually it booted up. Just for piece of mind I rebooted.....it hung up again at the animation. After it eventually booted I messed around some more to try and get a feel for the device. After a while the screen began to REALLY lock up and tap after tap after tap did nothing. Swipes across the screen didn't work.....then after a few minutes it began to work again. This occurred over and over again. Applications would just stop working. Then after a few minutes, work again. Thought I'd give it one more try.......so this morning it won't even turn on.\nNothing I tried would turn it on......even the hard/soft re-boot did anything. Plugging it in and still no charging light. Returning it today........haven't even had it more that 12 hrs.....worked for about 3 and then became a brick over night."}

My tablet usage went from daily to almost never almost immediately.\n\nIt's hard to put my finger on exactly what I didn't like about the Xoom. It just boiled down to it not being fun to use. It might have something to do with the weight (thing weighs a million pounds), the odd wide screen form factor, the aesthetics, or the fact that it was awkward to hold. Combine all that with the lack of serious development for Android tablets and it left the Xoom sitting on my shelf, barely being used. When it comes down to it, the iPad (despite its faults) was a pleasure to use while the Xoom was awkward and not much fun at all.\n\nI also bought the Touchpad when they went on fire sale, which I've since installed Android on.

I still use an iPad and a EVO View tablet, and enjoy those as well.  I did like Honeycomb on the Xoom, but must say Ice Cream Sandwich is amazing - IMO"}

ICS upgrade came through in md JAN and had first minor issues; no matter, so many apps and files and even added thethering to my cell plan.  First very bad sign was last week when I got a screen graphic of an Android bot on its front with hatch open, but I pushed button to darken screen and then on and it did come back. But just a while ago the Xoom died, cannot even charge. Whether or not MOTO does repair and return or give another I am soured on thiem and as much has it financially will hurts am considering another brand tablets, accesssories and all because I love having a tablet of this class.

Its great for watching movies and TV shows (those functions are not available outside the US, however), books, and of course APPS!!! Whats even better is that I have 10 hours of battery life to enjoy it! The recent ICS update (no other tablet besides the xoom and transformer prime has it as of yet!) was a great improvement for the Xoom, as it is now a lot faster and looks a lot cooler! When I first got it I was concerned about weight due to past reviewers. I was actually surprised to find it so light! My sister has an IPad2 and its barely a quarter of a pound lighter! The Xoom is great for school as there are TONS of note-taking and organization apps on the Android Market available (my favorite is ClassBuddyPro)! There is also a large selection of casual and hard core games too, In fact I just bought MC3 on sale for 0.99! The only thing about the Xoom that I'm dissatisfied with is the amount of apps that are specifically designed for tegra honeycomb/ics tabs. Also, I've heard complaints about not being able to charge with a micro USB cable, and while it may be inconvenient, the charging time is a mere hour! Overall BUY this product (the Xyboard or Xoom 2 is actually slower and more buggy than the original - yet 300 bucks more) today!!!\n\nPS: I got the Xoom Protective case as well as the gel one and they work just fine. I also got&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Targus-CleanVu-Cleaning-Pads-for-Apple-iPad-iPad-2-iPhone-Motorola-Xoom-Samsung-Galaxy-BlackBerry-Playbook-TXA00212US/dp/B004TLH7C0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Targus CleanVu Cleaning Pads for Apple iPad, iPad 2, iPhone, Motorola Xoom, Samsung Galaxy, BlackBerry Playbook TXA00212US</a>&nbsp;and they are great to remove the fingerprints and dust that is attracted to your tab!

Example: Solitaire is touch the card and it moves; I touch my lap top and nothing happens.  This tablet gives me the option to view full rather than abbreviated web pages this giving me CNBC Pro (CNBC says they do not have this application for Android platform) and ESPN 3 (video on demand as in 6 matches of the Australian Open IF your Internet providers gives you this service).  The only exception I have found so far is YouTube: it \"knows\" you are on a tablet so some content is unavailable \"on a mobile platform.\"\n\nIf you use Fire Fox (free with \"don't follow\"), this app still doesn't play Adobe Flash; the in house Internet web browser does have this capability and as such CNBC Pro and ESPN3 play with little problem (I can't figure if ocasional problem with ESPN streaming video is with my provider or ?).\n\nNeedless to say, this is my first tablet (I'm an old guy who awaited powerful laptops to acquire only after the price dropped to <US $1000) and I got the 32 meg for about US $405 and bought locally just after Christmas.\n\nNB one thing you need to know:  while Google bought Motorola Mobile which means this will be supported with timely updates as ICS, it does weigh just over 1.5 pounds (US).

After reading about the different types of 10 inch tablets out there, I decided to buy the Motorola Xoom. I was lucky to find a used one which came with a leather case and screen protector. I bought an external memory card and a stylus and have been using it every day since I received it in the mail. The screen is very crisp and clear and tapping and dragging action very good. Finding free apps online is very easy. The tablet came with Honeycomb 3.2.1 and recently upgraded itself to Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.3. It plays music and games, stores pictures and movies, plays movies and can run Flash Player for You Tube videos. I've loaded both Nook and Kindle reader software, plus Google free reader. There are thousands of free books online and also free music downloads from Google. The Wi-Fi is very fast and it picks up Guest and Visitor hot spots very easily."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I bought this for my husband for his birthday last year, mostly so our kids could watch movies and play games while we were traveling.  I ALMOST returned the darn thing out of frustration of getting movies onto it, but after a lot of research and work, I was able to get it to work for us so we kept it.  It's been great since then.  We would have gotten an iPad, but they don't have flash capability (crazy, right?), and a lot of websites we use require flash (like my business site, very important to access).  I also liked that this had expandable memory, since we'll mostly be using this for movies and games.\n\nSo let me explain the movie ordeal: those \"digital\" copies you get in these combo DVD/Blu-Ray packs?  Silly.  You'd think you'd be able to watch them on any digital device, which is not true.....you can watch them on your computer, or iTunes will convert them to use on an iPad or iPod.  Pretty crappy.  Once I figured this out, I realized I just needed to find a conversion software.  Unfortunately most of the cheaper conversion softwares do not convert Blu-Ray.  The software that costs more and claims to convert them don't always work either.  I've been using DVD Catalyst which works well and was only $10.  (For iTunes music conversion I used Double Twist, which is free.)\n\nWe don't use this with Verizon, but it's 4G ready if we ever decide to (we already have DROID phones, so didn't see the need).  We just use it with WiFi when necessary.  No connectivity problems....fast!\n\nPros:\n- Flash capability\n- Expandable memory\n- Plenty of free apps in the Android market\n- Long battery life\n- Fast, problem-free processor\n- Two headphone jacks\n\nCons:\n- Movies take much longer to put onto the tablet, whereas the iPad uses iTunes for easy access to movies/music"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I've had this Xoom for 7 months and it's been my constant companion.  Because I have several gmail accounts it's the easiest way to quickly check my email, and I love having it close by when I'm reading (actual hard copy books)so that when I come across something I want to look up online I don't have to wait and hope to remember to do it next time I'm near a computer. With the Xoom finding a copy of the Romanov family tree or getting more background on a fascinating throwaway line is fast, easy, and convenient. Also comfortable, since you can sit on a couch or in bed rather than at a computer desk. I thought I would use the Xoom as more of an eReader than I do, but while its big, high resolution screen makes it great for surfing the web it's heavier than I want for an eReader--for that I still prefer the Sony 350 or PRS-T1 eReaders which can be easily held in one hand. The Xoom is perfect though for looking at eBooks that are in color or have a lot of pictures, and since I can access all my Sony purchased books on the Xoom that feature has been a huge plus. There are also a lot of Android apps for other book readers, and using them you can get books for Nook, Kobo or Kindle--the Kindle application is especially wonderful because it makes it possible to quickly and easily download and read those Kindle free book samples, plus there are a lot of free books offered for Kindle.\n\nThe Xoom has just been upgraded to Android 4--the Ice Cream Sandwich--so it has several new features, widgets and perks, one of my favorite being the ability to create attractive desktop folders.  My enthusiasm for using the Xoom meant that all my bookmarks and apps were really starting to clutter up the screen."}

The thickness of the xoom is perfect, not too thick and bulky, nor too thin/breakable feeling.

But since I go to college and have to lug something around for my books and to type up notes with. This thing works amazing!\n\nLet me get into my breakdown of things I love about this thing.\n\nOPTIONS!: Loads and loads of options, this tablet is so customizable down to every little detail. Android has an amazing set of Apps, you can change anything. You can download anything. You can play anything. Basically, this thing is so close to a laptop it is scary. Which is what makes me change my tune about tablets some.\n\nBattery Life: From the first time I fired it up and charged it. It lasted about 10 hours. And it is very efficient at saving battery life, big thing is dim the screen brightness when you don't need it. And let it go into standby mode when not in use. Some days, I'm at school all day, and by the end of the day it still has juice left. Love it\n\nFeatures: This tablet I chose over others because of how versatile it is. Micro USB, and Micro HDMI ports. front and rear facing camera. Volume rocker on the side. Head Phone Jack. Well placed speakers. Many tablets have the front and rear facing camera the volume rocker, head phone jack and a spot for a charger....maybe even 1 type of USB connection, but an HDMI port! wow. And like i said everything is well placed and well thought out.\n\nQuality: This thing feels very well built and very high quality. Motorola is usually known for good quality products. This is very sturdy. The screen quality is vibrant. Everything looks sharp.\n\nThe only con I can actually think of is the weight, because this is one of the heavier tablets out there, but realistically, to me all tablets are light. I don't have any issues with the weight or carrying it around. But for some it could be thats why i listed it.\n\nOverall, the reason why I picked this over say, an Ipad is because this has so much more versatility. Sure the Ipad has its set of amazing apps, but it is so limiting. You can only do your music through them. you cant really customize it outside of the stuff the set up for you to customize it with. Right out of the box The Motorola Xoom is fully customizable and you can literally treat it like a laptop. Thats why it won my vote and my money."}

It's a lot of fun and useful too."}

I got it for my wife originally to be able to access her e-mail and Facebook on, but the kids just love games and ease of use.  My 9yr old didn't need me to teach her, she just picked it up and figured it out on her own.  I didn't realize that the apps you get on your phone (free or paid), show up on your other devices.  Very cool that you can buy something for your phone and still use it on your tablet.  Saves from having to download the same app multiple times.  The battery life is very good.  I have had it lock up a few times and had to figure out on my own that if you press the power buttong and the volume up button you can do a system re-set.  Other than the couple of lock ups, I have not had any issues with it and am very happy with my purchase."}

The info that came with it is a little short on instructions, but you can go online to receive any help needed. The device booted and updated without a flaw and has run great so far.  It just will take some time to take advantage of all the features. There is a learning curve involved in using a tablet for the 1st time. The only con would be there is no way of telling when it is thinking as you touch the screen to make your next choice. So you end up touching it several times to move on to the next thing you want to do."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I purchased my Xoom just after it's release and at that time I would have given the product a solid 3 stars.  My unit was just returned from Motorola for the lte upgrade and that seemed to coincide with a software upgrade that installed a few days later.\n\nSince the upgrades, it has been next to impossible to keep applications from locking or simply closing.  At times there are pauses in typing and it can take from a few seconds to several for it to catch up.  This used to happen before the upgrade but was seldom.  Now it occurs every time I use it.  I like the Google operating system which I have on my Droid Bionic as well.  But these two devices will probably be my last Motorola purchases.  Employees at our company that have purchased these devices have the same issues.  We have one I pad 2 in the house and after barrowing this unit for a recent business trip the difference is dramatic.  I realize that the Xoom has a higher resolution screen however the ipad clearly is sharper with better colors.  Reading with the ipad was much more comfortable for my eyes as there is little glare in comparison to the Xoom.\n\nWould highly recommend Apple."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "(Please note that I'm including links to products mentioned in this review so that you can easily read more about them if you wish.)\n\nSome people criticize the Motorola XOOM (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Motorola-XOOM/dp/B0045FM6SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Motorola XOOM</a>) for not being as thin & lightweight as several other 10\" tablets.  If you want the thinnest & lightest-weight 10\" tablet, you may wish to consider an Apple iPad 2 (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Apple-iPad-2/dp/B001I907I2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Apple iPad 2</a>), Samsung Galaxy Tab (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab/dp/B00519RWI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung Galaxy Tab</a>), or ASUS Transformer (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ASUS-Transformer/dp/B004U78JT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ASUS Transformer</a>).  However, in my opinion, if you want THE BEST 10\" tablet, get the slightly thicker & heavier XOOM ... all are fine choices, but I believe the XOOM is the best of them, and costs significantly less than all but the ASUS, which - although not quite as good as the other three - is worthy of consideration.\n\nAs a point of reference, I have two fast & powerful notebook PCs, an upgraded & very potent MacBook, and two high-performance Android phones (yes, I know it all may sound like a bit much, but it comes with the territory for the type of work I do), yet - as a very busy computer consultant who's constantly on the go, working one-on-one with hundreds of clients - it's the XOOM I use the most ... all day, every day ... for email, scheduling & calendaring, accessing websites, editing photos, note-taking, scanning, faxing, uploading & downloading files, running countless apps, and so much more ... its design, build quality, performance, and reliability are outstanding.\n\nI use a 32 GB internal memory XOOM with a 32 GB Transcend microSD memory card (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Transcend-32-GB-Class-4-microSDHC-Flash-Memory-Card/dp/B004R7P28W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Transcend 32 GB Class 4 microSDHC Flash Memory Card</a>), which is my recommended configuration for a 'premium' tablet ... however, any high-quality tablet should serve you well, regardless of its memory configuration ... if your tablet accommodates a memory card, it's a good idea to store everything you can onto the card, thereby freeing up as much internal memory as possible, which helps maximize the tablet's performance (the same applies to mobile phones).\n\nAs you may know, many people claim the Apple iOS app market has more apps from which to choose than does the Android app market ... the problem with this rationale is that quality is more important than quantity ... and the Android app market is superior in quality for one simple reason: Google owns Android (not surprisingly, Google also owns the mobile component of Motorola, arguably the premier manufacturer of mobile devices ... the ramifications of this are more appropriate for another forum) ... suffice it to say that the universe of computers and all things computer-related is a 'Google universe' ('Googleverse') ... as such, all of Google's apps are available for Android, and other app developers are, of course, joining the Google bandwagon.\n\nSo if you're unsure whether to go with the stylish-but-sinking Apple (which means choosing an iPad) or the rising Android (which means choosing the XOOM, the Galaxy Tab, the Transformer, or any of the many other good Android tablets, including the very nice & terrifically-priced 7\" Amazon Kindle Fire (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Amazon-Kindle-Fire/dp/B0051VVOB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Amazon Kindle Fire</a>) and the excellent & affordable 10\" Toshiba Thrive (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/10-Toshiba-Thrive/dp/B0052P6UM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">10\" Toshiba Thrive</a>) or 7\" Toshiba Thrive (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/7-Toshiba-Thrive/dp/B006DI6T4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">7\" Toshiba Thrive</a>), the choice is simple: choose your favorite Android tablet.  (That said, and in the interest of fairness, the iPad is a wonderful device with bazillions of terrific apps, and if you don't mind overpaying to go the Apple route, I think you'll be pleased with it.)\n\nA word of caution regarding the XOOM: If you're inserting a microSD card into the XOOM's memory card slot, be very careful to position the card properly before pushing it in ... the opening is large enough so that you can inadvertently push the card into the XOOM without getting it into the actual card slot ... thankfully, this should not adversely affect your XOOM in any way, and it leaves the memory card slot available and fully functional ... you can retrieve the mis-inserted card by opening the XOOM's case using a Torx T5 screwdriver, locating the card (which is about 7/16\" wide), and VERY GENTLY removing it.\n\nAnother bit of advice regarding all tablets (and smartphones): Don't assume your device needs a screen protector ... most people who use them believe screen protectors provide a good defense against scratching the glass screen ... however, consider that protectors are made of plastic, which scratches easily, while the glass screen is highly-resistant to scratches (just don't try testing its scratch-resistance with diamonds or other known glass-scratchers, and your screen should be fine!) ... screen protectors also attract more dirt, dust, and fingerprints than non-protected screens, and they're far more difficult to clean than the standard glass screen ... and protectors can dim the display (even if just a relatively small amount) ... so why use them at all? ... well, if they provide you with additional peace of mind, go ahead ... they're harmless.  Given all this, if you prefer using a screen protector, I recommend GreatShield Ultra Smooth Clear Screen Protector Film (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/GreatShield-Ultra-Smooth-Clear-Screen-Protector-Film/dp/B00513H3D8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">GreatShield Ultra Smooth Clear Screen Protector Film</a>) ... it's made of sturdy, high-quality materials, it's custom-fit for your specific device, it's washable & reusable, removing it leaves no residue on the screen, it doesn't smudge easily, and it's barely noticeable if applied properly.  As with most screen protectors, it can be difficult to remove all the air bubbles when applying it ... but if you're a screen-protector fan, & you can get the air bubbles out, I think you may like this product.\n\nI'm exceptionally picky and demanding regarding the products I choose to purchase & use for myself, and recommend to my clients.  I thoroughly compare specifications, reviews, performance, advantages & disadvantages, price, design, build quality, battery charge, ease of use, and much more ... all factors tangible and otherwise ... it's well worth the effort, particularly because I rely upon these items as a demanding computer professional, and - just as importantly - because I insist upon providing my clients with the very best information and recommendations, so that they can make the most educated and informed decisions for their needs, preferences, and budgets.  All things considered, the Motorola XOOM is - in my opinion - simply the best 10\" tablet available ... and it's certainly thin & lightweight enough for most people to carry around and use very comfortably & easily.\n\n(If you're wondering about my second choice, it's basically a toss-up between the Samsung Galaxy Tab and the Toshiba Thrive ... both are available in 10\" and 7\" sizes, and they're close runners-up to the XOOM ... the Galaxy Tab is consistently - and deservedly - among the highest-rated Android tablets, while the Thrive's 10\" version has a number of very cool features, including being one of the few good tablets - if not the only - designed with a user-replaceable battery ... technically, you can replace the battery in any tablet by using the proper tools and a bit of care & effort, but you may risk voiding the product's warranty ... kudos to Toshiba for removing this unnecessary restriction.  The Thrive tends to receive mixed reviews, but I respectfully maintain that it's a wonderful tablet, and it's nicely priced.  Should you choose either of these (or any of the other tablets mentioned in this review, for that matter), I think you'll be thrilled with your choice.\n\nAnd I'd be remiss if I didn't emphasize that if you're looking for the combination of best tablet/lowest price, I recommend that you look no further than the Kindle Fire ... while somewhat proprietary, and not as potent & feature-packed as more-expensive tablets, its combination of quality, features, performance, ease-of-use, and price make it a flat-out bargain!)\n\nShould you have any questions regarding the purchase and use of a tablet, or any other computer-related issues (including Macs, PCs, smartphones, apps, and more), please feel welcome to contact me at your convenience (i'm easy to find on the internet ... personal computer lessons in berkeley, ca ... joel)."}

Like him, I found the Android system not entirely intuitive, but have grown to like it more and more as I've gained experience with it. Plus, we know that the Android Marketplace is catching up with iPad's.\n\nA few things I'd like to see as Android matures include (1) a better way of navigating around text documents - a clubby finger just doesn't serve like directional arrows would.  (2) Many of the apps are too sensitive to touch; I much too often find myself following links when my intention is to move the page up or down.  (3) The quality of apps varies significantly, with some offering flawless navigation and use (Slate) and others completely failing (Salon, PhysOrg).  I suspect these issues are similar to iPad apps.\n\nOne thing about the Xoom is the weight issue; it does weigh upon one's senses after a fairly short time.  In total, though, I'm very satisfied."}

(Waiting for an app that works like microsoft one note.)  I highly recommend it!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Let me preface this by saying I bought my Xoom at Target for $399.99, which included a free case.  I did not like the case, so Target refunded $35 and I effectively bought the Xoom for $365.  At that price point, the Xoom is very, very hard to beat.  This is a 32 GB machine, with a slot for harddrive expandability and 3G/4G capability and mini USB and HDMI output ports that do not require a propietary cable.  All the other hardware specs are as good as competing (and more expensive) models.  At the initial offering price of $800 it's easily beatable, and at the current $500 there are other formidable options.  However in $400-$500 price range, all other offerings are 16 GB not 32 GB.\n\nI won't go into the iPad vs. Android tablet comparisons.  Apple makes a great product, but their closed business model has too many drawbacks for my needs and wants.  I absolutely abhore having to go through iTunes for everything, and with the lack of expandability the iPad was off my tablet list.  16 GB of storage is not enough and I am not going to pay $650 for a 32 GB model.\n\nThe Android app space does have it's issues with fragmentation and not knowing which apps are best suited for tablets, phones, etc.  However, I am willing to suffer through some of the growing pains in order to have a more open and useable hardware platform.  The Android Market place has it's issues, but there are TONs of great free apps and it's improving everyday.\n\nWith that said, I love the Motorola Xoom.  I agree with many of the reviewers that the display is not on par with iPad and Samsung tablets.  It's no slouch either.  On axis it's just as good in my opinion, but off axis viewing suffers.  It took me a return to get a Xoom with a display that I liked.  I am wondering if Motorola has second sourced displays and if some Xoom's have better displays than others?  I was not happy with my first one, and took it back.  I am more than happy with my current Xoom.  I will say that the Xoom display does not have the 178 degree off axis viewing angle of the IPS screens on the Galaxy and Asus Transformer.  However, for the large majority of viewing angles the Xoom display is very, very good.  The Xoom does have Gorilla Glass, so that is a huge plus for me.\n\nI tried the Asus Transformer, based on the positive reviews online, however I took it back after seeing backlight bleedthrough and having sensitivity issues with the touchscreen.  Both of those issues seemed to be common complaints of the Transformer.  I have not had any quality control issues with the Xoom.  Overall, the Transformer seemed like a nice machine, but the touchscreen sensitivity issues (having to press multiple times to register an action) scared me away.  Reading that this was not an uncommon thing kept me from considering it, despite the positive reviews.\n\nThe speakers on the Xoom are top notch, compared to other tablets.  They are rear facing, but that hasn't been an issue for me.  The build quality on the Xoom is also top notch.  It is heavier than other tablets, but I do not mind that at all, and it is not an issue.  Thinness, thickness is not a big concern of mine.  The Xoom is plenty thin and comfortable to hold.\n\nThe one drawback is the power cable.  It is proprietary and looks to be undersized for mechanical purposes.  I talked to the guys at Best Buy and they said they have not had alot of issues with the port pins breaking, etc.  Online, a few people have had some broken charging ports, but most of those have been due to accidents.  There does not seem to be a widespread mechanical problem with the charging port.  The advantage is that charging times with this port (it charges at 12VDC) are very fast.  The Xoom does not charge via the mini USB port, for better or worse.  Many models do not charge via mini USB either.\n\nI opted against the Samsung Galaxy because the 10.1 inch models do not have SD slots and have 16 GB harddrives at the $450-$500 price range.\n\nI have been very happy with my Xoom, and at $400 I don't think there is a better tablet out there.  I did sacrifice off axis viewing, but on axis the display is splendid.  If Motorola had used IPS display technology this tablet would've been homerun at any pricepoint, at $365 it's a steal.  Very solid machine."}

Ebook reader that comes with the OS doesn't support PDF. Adobe PDF ready is easily downloadable but the gui doesn't seem to be written for tablets and has poor library management. Windows 7 does not recognize xoom when plugged in to USB (yes, I tried enabling \"USB Debugging\" on the tablet & downloading the latest drivers from motorola).\n\nLastly, I have had the browser crash several times on me. Not a lot, but maybe once every hour or two.\n\nSo basically the xoom is only useful for web surfing and listening to music, and not email or watching videos. Very disappointing. This is the most disappointing piece of tech I've purchased in the last 5 years."}

Its design is slightly different, but one characteristic that really upset me is that this tablet comes with 16Gb instead of 32Gb. The price really worth it(I payed $380 inteadof $450), but the seller had to write the correct description and not to sell the tablet as the original XOOM one."}

First and foremost I transfered some shows from my computer to the xoom and the playback is awful.  Choppy and sound has sync problems and sometimes just slows down. I Googled about this issue and I read alot about experimenting to find best specs to encode videos that actually play normally on the xoom.  I can do this because I'm a technical person but if your not this is not the tablet for you.\nIts also heavy and gets very uncomfortable to hold after awhile.\nBut aside from that I guess its decent.  If I had to pay I would never buy it."}

I waited until Motorola got the Micro SD card and Skype video working correctly before purchasing the Xoom.  Both features work great and the product was worth the wait! The Micro SD was a big factor for me, along with the bluetooth ability to share personal files without Itunes' prior approval. Also, not having to connect to a computer with Itunes just to get the unit to operate was a big plus! The Xoom worked right out of the box, and immediately let me know when the latest Honeycomb OS was available, OVER THE AIR, and not having to connect to another computer to get the up date. (Something Apple just recently figured out. By the way, I also own an Ipad 2, but gave it to my wife as the Xoom is much easier to customize and I'm more tech oriented.)\n\nI hope Mototrola and Google continue to support this unit.\n\nThe only downside for me is the oem charging port, rather than using the micro-usb port to charge. The proprietary plug is also fragile looking."}

I have been using a original Ipad first generation the past 18 months and finally made the change several weeks ago and haven't looked back.  I'm a heavy Google user including music, pictures, emails, calander and contacts so this device is perfect.  Plus I'm not limited to iTunes and other apple restrictions.  I currently have both the razr and Droid 2, in the past I've owned the Droid 1 and original Motorola Droid phone.  I will never go back to apple, both my kids inherited my old Ipad and making good use of the device by playing games and puzzles.  I highly recommend the xoom, and purchased a second unit to my mother as a holiday gift.  BTW i purchased mine for $499 two weeks ago only to have verzion credit my account $300 for the black friday sale they had offering the xoom for $199 with a two year contract.  Since i already had 4g hotspot on my razr for $30 per month the service was transfered to this device and Im able to contect other computer devices by using the xoom as my hub.  And off course I cancelled the service on my razr and this will not make a financial difference to me.  Good luck and thanks for reading.\n\nAdded 11.27.2011...\n\nYou can change the settings on you tablet to view full websites compared to mobile sites.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I was actually thinking of getting a Kindle Fire because the price is about what I wanted to spend on a e-reader... then I read that it doesn't support any type of storage media... mmm?  Well I know that books kept on the cloud reader would be available without taking up storage space, but then, do I really want something so limited??  Not really, so I pretty much put a hold on getting an e-reader... my wife has the 3G/WiFi Kindle and loves it! I got it for her Birthday present last year and she rarely reads a real paperback any more.\nA couple of days later I received a notice from amazon.com regarding amazon bucks that I had accumulated $303 !!!  Well now, that puts a whole different spin on a e-reader/tablet.  I've been looking at the Xoom since it first came out and thought that it would make a great traveling device... but it does so much more!!\nI have to be upfront and disclose that I'm a Google/Droid lover!  Yes, I'm one of those types, I'll admit it right here and now.  I have a 2nd generation Motorola Droid cell phone, plus I've loved Google products from the very beginning, and still do!  So when the Xoom first came out I thought it looked like something that would be fun to play around with, like a GIANT Droid... but the cost was not feasible, plus I didn't like the idea of paying for another data plan.  Changes happened in all the right directions and made it possible and feasible to purchase the Xoom and I'm so glad that I did.  This thing is truly a ROCK Star in my world of tablets and I'll tell you why, here and now!\nThere are three things that I want a tablet for:\n1 - Music! First and foremost I love music and I'm a digital collector when is comes to music, all kinds of music, literally more different than any one else I know of.  In comes Google Music Beta, a place to keep all my digital albums, and I can listen to them anywhere I go, as long as I have a internet connection, plus amazon cloud player... I pretty much purchase all my music through amazon.com and they give me unlimited storage space to keep my purchases, or upload from my collection too.  With music being my number 1 drug of choice it pretty much eliminates anything to do with iTunes, sorry, just won't play that Steve Jobs proprietorial game.  Don't get me wrong, Apple products are probably the best out there in the consumer and professional world, but a will NOT purchase music that makes it difficult to play on various devices (I'm NOT going to burn every album to a CD so I can turn the songs into MP3 files.)\n2 - Photography is my second love, sometimes my first, so I wanted something that would be able to view my on-line photo-albums as well as store some of my favorites.  The Xoom does all that and more!  Not only does it have a great app for viewing albums, including running a slide show, but it takes pretty darn good photos too!  I use the CameraFX app to do most of my \"from the hip\" Droid shots and the CameraFX app automatically loaded from my Droid phone when I set up the Xoom (pretty cool!) and now I use it on the Xoom too.  Plus it has a rear facing camera (video & still) to do video chats or take a picture of your self... I supposed you could video yourself too if your into that thing, I'm not.  I use Skype a lot at home to make long distance phone calls and video calls... loaded up without a glitch one on the Xoom and works great!\n3 - And you were wondering what happened to the e-reader thing?  OK, reading comes in at number 3... what can I say, I'm a visual type of person who loves listening to music!  I also love reading, but we have a smallish home and I would say that between my wife and I (mostly my wife) we have appropriated a large amount of interior real estate to bookshelves and books (yes we have stacks of them, literally!) and having an e-reader helps with this problem considerably.  Well I loaded up the Kindle program on the Xoom and now I have access to my digital books plus a wide variety of magazines and newspapers... and Google has another app for access to their library, although I haven't had time to check it out yet.\nAll the other PLUS's with Xoom include watching movies from Netfix and amazon.com - I just started the trial of Amazon Prime and I'm really liking it so far... lottsa movies and TV shows to stream, books to check out for a month at a time, all for the low price of $79 a year, which equates to roughly $6.58 per month and includes some really good deals on DVD's and Blueray's.\nIn the end, my new Motorola Xoom WiFi does everything our laptop does with the exception of running Citrix (a client for remote access to our work computers) at 1/5 the size and weight, plus it's battery life it WAY better than the laptops (I ran it for 6+ hours yesterday and had 67% battery left!)  Works wirelessly on WIFI no 3/4G data plan needed!!!!\nSo I guess the only downside would be you need WIFI to connect to the internet and other wireless devices, like a printer.  As I said at the beginning of the review, the Xoom \"is truly a ROCK Star in my world.\"  The Perfect Storm happened and now I'm the happy owner of a Xoom tablet."}

Necesitaba dos tablets y por dicha razn adquir una Xoom y una Acer Iconia W500. Comprar la Xoom fue un error total,ya que es un aparato que al menos a m no me sirve absolutamente para nada. Lo nico bueno es que es liviano, aparenta bien construido, es rpido y con buena respuesta de la pantalla tctil. En dichos aspectos es mejor que la Iconia.\nEn cuanto a la utilidad para trabajar no le encuentro nada buena a esta tablet. No se puede editar documentos de texto, presentaciones y planillas, que para m son la clave de todo trabajo. Tampoco se puede imprimir nada. He comprado el programa Quick Office Pro del Android Market, que tambin es otro producto inservible.\nEn cuanto a entretenimiento, como navegar por la Web, tomar fotografas, filmar, ver pelculas lo hago con otros aparatos destinados a ello mucho mejor.\nCreo que lo que la gente en realidad necesita es una tablet con la que se pueda trabajar realmente como en cualquier computadora y que adems pueda ser conectada a cualquier dispositivo en forma fcil. Para ms Xoom necesita que uno transporte consigo los cables especiales que tiene.\nAdems, como compr en Amazon, la versin no viene con 3G. El teclado (tambin compr), no puede ser pasado al espaol, a pesar de que en el manual (lo le antes de comprar) dice que s. Al reclamar esto a la gente de Motorola me contestaron que lo sentan, pero los Xoom que se venden en USA no pueden ser pasados a teclados en espaol. Creo que esto ltimo es un grave error de Motorola porque el mundo ahora es de todos y uno compra productos en cualquier pas, y ms de que ninguno de USA.\nEn resumen para mi este es un aparato totalmente intil, que puede servir para entretenimiento pero no para trabajar."}

READ RETURN POLICY IN FULL BEFORE BUYING!!!  They will not return any electronic equipment that has been opened!  (How do you even know if it's broken until you open it???!)  I got my Xoom on Wed. afternoon, played with it a total of about 6 hours before it froze up completely on Friday afternoon.  My brand new tablet froze on start-up, and wouldn't even turn off.  I went out of my way to not buy refurbished so that I could avoid any hassles with it.  HA!  So, I went online and tried the recovery to factory settings (wiping data) and it made no difference.  I saved all boxes, papers, screen cover, etc. that it came with in case I had to return it.  They will NOT return...even though it is obviously their defective product.  After a few emails and a phone call with a VERY rude customer service lady (who seems like she deals with angry calls about defective products all day long!), I now have no option but to go through the Motorola warranty.  So, the only way I can have a tablet for my trip is to go to Best Buy and buy a new one.  SO wish I had just done that in the beginning.  This horrific experience has forever soured me on buying any large items on Amazon.  Or, at least through a 3rd party, no matter how decent their reviews look.  These people at WorldWide Distributors are SHADY!!!  BUYER BEWARE!!!!!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I got my xoom last week and compared to my Acer Aspire One netbook, I'm disappointed.  The size is great and looks good.  However this is missing a lot of things I thought it would have.  First of all, it seems unless I am willing to take the chance and screw up my tablet, to get more of the features I was expecting, I would have to root my Xoom.  This not only voids the warranty but I might mess up an make the whole thing inoperable.  The Micro SD card now works with the Honeycomb upgrade to 3.2 but it is read only.  The Xoom can play flash, but since it's an Android OS, you can't use Hulu.  Also, most websites open as mobile sites, not as a regular site, even though there's enough screen real estate to do so.  Most disappointing of all, I can't connect to my Wifi Hotspot on my mobile phone because the hotspot is a Ad Hoc network.  On my netbook, I can do all these things as standard features.  This is pretty basic stuff, yet I am unable to do this on my Unrooted Motorola Xoom.  In buying this Xoom, I thought I would be able to leave my netbook behind when I travel.  But what I have really bought was a large iPod and not a computer replacement."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Having now owned my Motorola Xoom for 10 days now, I can give an honest assessment of it compared to the ipad (1 &2). Having owned an ipad I must admit when I got it, I loved it for about 15 minutes! Don't get me wrong the ipad is awesome. It's awesome if you are an average user and don't mind the proprietary nature of Mac products (the ipad is just too simple for me). I am an above average user of PC's. I quickly found that the ipad didn't play well with my PC, this did not sit well with me. Had I owned a MAC computer, maybe but I don't, I will always be a PC guy. If you are a MAC fan, stop reading this review right now!!\n\nEDIT: Since I received my Xoom and since writing this review, I have not been able to put my Xoom down! There are SO MANY advantages over the ipad that it's ridiculous! When I bought my ipad, within 3 days I was completley bored with it. $600 is an awful expensive alarm clock!\n\nOk so Xoom: Having never used one before I have to admit the learning curve for Android is much steeper than that of the iOS. Being a self taught PC guru, made the learning curve of the android not so steep at least not for me anyway. If you are NOT a techie and not familiar with the Android OS, I do not recommend the Xoom for you, unless you know someone that already has one and can help you out.\n\nHere are the main uses I have for my tablets: E-mail, Music, Video, Web browsing, HDMI output, Bluetooth connectivity. The user interface must also be manipulable. I will detail each one by one and compare to the ipad.\n\n1. E-mail: I was very leery of the proprietary approach to Google Applications with this tablet. I did not want to be trapped in such a way that ipad can trap you. You do have to create a Google account if you want the on-line experience that the Xoom provides, this actually is not a bad thing. The e-mail app was the very first thing I wanted setup. The stock e-mail app that comes with Xoom - is Phenomenal! But compared to ipads e-mail client - they were about even. I was able to successfully set it up to retrieve my Windows Live e-mail with no problem as I was with the ipad. The difference? When the Xoom goes into power save mode and if I receive an e-mail there is a blinking white indicator light on the Xoom that alerts me that I have a new e-mail.\nE-mail client: Advantage Xoom\n\n2. Music: Who doesn't love iTunes? I do love iTunes, in the capacity that I love playlists. It was VERY important that I had the same experience with Xoom as I had with the ipad (using iTunes). The stock music player that comes with the Xoom just does not cut the mustard. There is no ability to create or import the playlists that I spent countless hours creating in iTunes. This concerned me. Off to the Android market I went, and after about 3 days of downloading and searching for a music App that worked well in the Xoom and allowed the importation of playlists created in iTunes, I found one! Thank god! The App I found was called PlayerPro. I drag and drop the music from an iTunes playlist into a folder on my desktop, drag that folder containing the music into my Xoom, then drag the music folder into Windows Media Player, create the Playlist name, open the containing folder for the .WPL and drag it onto the Xoom - Whala - Playlist created!\nStock Music player - Advantage iPad\nProprietary use of off brand music player - Advantage Xoom\n\n3. Video: I am a frequent international traveler. Being able to watch movies on the go is very important! The stock movie player with Xoom isn't feature rich but who cares about features when you are watching a movie. Open movie, play movie, pause movie, resume movie, quit movie. It's perfect\nVideo Player: Tied with ipad\n\nEDIT: No longer tied with ipad! A free App called MX Video player allows you to play: .AVI, .MPEG, .MP4, .AAC, .WMV. unsupported are the itunes proprietary .M4V and the .MKV\nAdvantage: HUGE Advantage Xoom!\n\n4. Web browsing: I was so excited when I got my ipad because I assumed I would be able to stream video - NOT! No flash content in ipad. There are many browser apps in the android market - bottom line, a browser is a browser, can I stream video? The purest test of this? I have NFL Game Pass subscription, where I can stream live NFL games right onto my laptop or home computer. Went to the site with my ipad - uh no, that wasn't smart.\n\nEDIT: Flash is NOT available on ipad. Contrary to what anyone says, you will NOT be able to stream video on an ipad like you can on the Xoom!). Watching my team, live from Xoom streamed over the internet was PRICELESS - PERFECT!!!!!\nWeb Browsing: Advantage - Xoom! Ipad isn't even on the same planet!\n\n5. HDMI Output - Both tablets will connect pretty seamlessly to your TV or monitor using a standard HDMI cable. The difference? Xoom plays videos in FULL 1080P HD - iPad? Not so much\nHDMI Output: Advantage Xoom (EDIT: I finally received my HDMI cable. The full 1080p was STUNNING. I transferred and watched \"Avatar - Extended version\" the screen was absolutley AMAZING. The resolution was like watching Blu-Ray on steroids!)\nNo contest ipad loses BIG time here~!\n\n6. Bluetooth connectivity: While you can connect to a MAC with your ipad over a Bluetooth connection, you cannot connect an ipad to a PC via Bluetooth! Seamless blue tooth connectivity to my keyboard and mouse! No annoying re-connects!\nBluetooth: PC users advantage Xoom, MAC users - Who cares.\n\n7. User Interface (UI): While they may appear to be evenly matched in this regard, the really annoying thing about ipad was the wallpaper and very simplistic nature of the UI. What is the point of having a really cool wallpaper if it is hidden behind all your Apps? I truly hated that about ipad. With the Xoom, you get 5 home screens. You can layout your app icons in any way you see fit and anywhere on your screen. I love my wallpapers. Now I can arrange ALL app icons at the bottom row of every screen and my wallpaper is in FULL view at all time. The app icon manipulation and UI freedom with Xoom has evolved light years beyond the ipad.\nUser interface: Advantage Xoom in a landslide!\n\nThere you have it. If you are a PC user and HATE the proprietary nature of ipad - the Xoom is for you. If you are a simple minded average user who doesn't enjoy freedom - stick with ipad.\n\nDon't let fact that you are not a techie type person persuade you to buy an ipad and be trapped by it. I paid $16.00 for \"Xoom for Dummies\" from my Kindle App. Read it cover to cover!\n\nOverall: ADVANTAGE XOOM - iPad 2 should not even be compared to the Xoom - as it couldn't even carry the Xoom's lunch to a picnic!\n\nStart the Xoom revolution!"}

The reason i picked xoom over other brand is because the specs are worth the money you pay for. Samsung galaxy tab has the same specs and a slightly lower mass but going to cost you $70 more.\nSomeone said this device is heavy but i love the weight as it feels more solid to me.\n\nBesides this device is being helpful in the school. I don't like to carry a 3kg laptop and have to wait for 2 minutes for the computer to turn on. But with Xoom, all u have to do is to press the standby button at the back of the xoom and it comes out in less than 1 second.\nThe web browsing is the best thing u can find on the xoom. The Xoom is paired with google chrome and it won't lag even i opened 10 tabs at a time.\nThe tablet erformance is above average and the system runs smoothly. Another great deal on this android device is, you can get tons of apps for free. Most of the \"paid apps\" on apple are free when they come to android.\n\nSo things get easier for my school but after 2 weeks of using it, i found 1 minor problem that the is annoying me. One day, my xoom doesn't respond after i pressed the standby/power button when it was on the sleep mode.\nI tried to press for a couple time and finally the standby screen slowly fade in with very dim display, i barely can see anything on the screen. So i tried to find the \"unlock ring\" and the screen back to normal again once it is being unlocked.\nSo another day i called the amazon customer service and they agreed to exchange another new XOOM for me.\nI was surprised with the excellent customer service that they even shipped the defective XOOM back to amazon without charging me.\nI had the same issue going on, on my 2nd Xoom after another 2 months time. Unfortunately the return policy only applies for 30 days and i contacted amazon again. They send me an email and they agreed to pay full refunds on my 2nd xoom included the shipping fees.\nsooner or latter i think motorola will fix this problem with updates.

Having had an iPhone for 9 months now I grew accustomed to how OS4 & OS5 both worked. But the Xoom with Android 3.2 straight out of the box was very easy to navigate.  I am already an Amazon Prime member so I purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mediabridge-High-Speed-Micro-HDMI-to-HDMI-Cable-with-Ethernet-6-Feet/dp/B004286VMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mediabridge - High Speed Micro-HDMI to HDMI Cable with Ethernet (6 Feet)</a>&nbsp;and was able to Stream an Amazon HD movie right away onto my LCD 1080p HDTV.

It is comparible to the Ipad2 screen but not as sharp as the IPhone screen.\nMotorola has already confirmed it will be upgrading the Xooms to Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4) a few months after it's official launch so this tablet has a long life ahead of it. I am extremely pleased with the Android platform. Unlike the Ilocked products, it is easy to customize to your liking. New Apps are coming out everyday also.\nI have not had a chance to check out the blue-tooth capabilities yet but its good to know I can add a blue tooth keyboard and USB mouse if I ever want to. I presume blue tooth printing is another feature I have yet to check into yet but any peripherals I decide to purchase I know won't be as expensive as Apple products.\nSome websites still get confused with the various Android OS builds and default to a mobile themed platform but with the xoom you can customize it to always display one way or the other, turn flash on or off,etc. Android is how I wish my PC OS would work.  Simple, functional.  This is the beginning of a long friendship!"}

The screen is very responsive it moves at 78htz the fastest tablet moves at 83htz. I can download any app on the market and it runs smooth no lag or glitching. When I use well over 700mbs of RAM it still goes fast. It blew me away when it aid it had 32gig HDD and a 5MP front can and 2MP rear cam. The speakers arnt to bad I can watch a movie in the car and I can hear it.\nThe only cons I can think of is, there's no micro SD slot or HDMI or USB. But other than that, I'm very impressed by it. Hope I helped thanks for reading."}

I read in the comments here on Azon somewhere about the seals being broken on the box. Mine were too. Last minute check or display model by the 3rd party seller? Unknown and working fine just weird to see them broken.\n\nI did learn that to setup for use you must have wireless connection. I planned to go wireless at home anyway but thought I could just set it up from my desktop. And that would be a no. Really, no setup options at all offline? Lazy, cheap, whatever that is a bit silly. Logged on from a friends wifi and my wireless router comes in the morning. Annoying but just moved my wireless plans a week earlier than planned. I just wanted to load some books Xoom!\n\nPlenty of data reviews here already so enough for you to decide. Price has been steady on the downward slide and I got a real good deal so I jumped early causing a few minor pains like the wifi issue. I just have had little use for it at home and it saturates work but had planned to do it anyway. Sweet device."}

It is not only enjoyable for me to use but it also keeps my 3 year old entertained at the doctors and in the car. I love that it's Android and I can have all the same apps on here as I do on my phone and I don't have to buy them over if they cost money. I rarely use my laptop anymore. I love that it's wi-fi so I don't have to pay someone to have service. And for those times I don't have wi-fi available I am still able to read or play games. I would recommend the Xoom over the IPad any day. Not only is the price worth it, but you get more memory for the money too."}

I should have bought this one from Amazon as I have usually shopped for the last 12 years on Amazon.  Amazon is simply the best place for online purchases.  Since Target offered the 32GB Xoom for $399 with a free Motorola tablet case worth $40, the price was irresistible.  Therefore, I decided to get the Xoom from there.\n\nFor the Xoom, I don't want to talk all the good things about it.  There are so many good reviews being posted in this forum.  All I can say is that this Xoom is the best.  Now, with the most recent software update for Xoom, I can read files stored in a micro SD card that can be inserted into a dedicated slot in Xoom.  The brightness of the screen is one of the main factors convincing me to get it after looking into other tablets. I really enjoy it!  I just have so much fun with it.\n\nOverall,  flash player is something this tablet as well as other Android ones can support while it is solely restricted in Ipads.  I would really recommend this tablet to anyone interested in it."}

The problem I found is that Verizon has the XOOM market in the US somehow locked to its market boundaries,however the product sells everywhere to anyone and therefore finds its way to countries like in Central America where internet providers are booming with strong competition. Therefore the product so far is locked and it is almost impossible to get support on unblocking the XOOM Tablet from Motorola. Another setback is that Google Earth is not available on this product for these countries, unbelievable, because everybody has it including the strong competitor Mac Ipads. So far, We have to wait for software upgrades to unlock it and extract the full potential of the XOOM Tablet. Android Market is a plus because many fine applications are free, except Google Earth which is not available at all not even purchasing it."}

Our requirement is simple: I want to watch videos online, my wife wants to read online and the kids want to play games.\n\nMy son is fixed on ipad 2. I am really apple-averse since I don't like to be controlled and ipad does not support flash. I really wanted an Android. I have read quite a few reviews on XOOM, especially the negative ones and felt that I could handle it since I am a faily technical guy and knows Unix quite well.\n\nToday My wife and I went to Best Buy to check them out.\n\nWe tried ipad 2 first. It is simple, elegant. Everything just work. My wife tried a few online novels and did not notice any porblem with the Chinese fonts. I tried my normal video site ([...]), fully expecting to be dispointed since ipad 2 does not support flash. To my pleasant surprise, most of the video works!\n\nWe then moved to the Android tablets. What a disaster! There were quite a few tablets, but I could not get a single video to work on any of them: the browser simply crashes! After trying for more than 20 minutes without success, I gave up: this thing is not ready for masss market!\n\nTo be fair to XOOM (and the other Android tablets), my problem is with Android, not necessarily the hardware. The Android screens look primitive as compared with ipad 2. The browser looks primitive too. XOOM screen is quite narrow. The browser URL and tabbing take too much precious vertical sapce. I don't care much about superficial stuff. I do care about what it can do! When the browser keeps crashing, I had enough.\n\nSome would say that my problem is wiht the browser, not Android, .... This may be true. But it appears that the whole Android thing is not mature enough yet. It could not get the simplest thing to work out of box. I buy a tablet to play. I don't want to spend countless hours tinkering with it.\n\nThe decision for me is simple: go with ipad 2 for now. I'll have another look at Android next time the tablet need to be replaced."}

What I do hate, however - and this is why it gets only four stars - is that the SD card is still not write-enabled.  My buddy working for Google swears he has a software-enabled version that does, but the public does not.  Yet, at least.  So what's the hold up?, 'cause that is a serious deal-breaker.\n\nOn the other hand, Apple's version doesn't even have an SD card slot.  Heck, it has nothing that isn't proprietary.  iPad was never on the table for me, and probably never will be.  Why anyone would go that direction when open source is available cheaper is beyond me.

It has far better cameras(front and rear),larger and higher screen resolution, expandable memory (micro SD), ability to install apps not just made by motorola(haha ipads can only get apps from the app store), I have never seen my xoom crash either, I get notifications no matter what app I am using unlike the ipad where you won't know until you close the app, the speakers are better on xoom than ipad because of the power and dual speakers, 32gb built in storage, 1gb of ram vs the ipads 512mb of ram, plus Motorola always makes very durable products, the only reason these won't outsell the ipad is due to marketing, Motorola needs to push out commercials to compete with all the ipad commercials. No one ever knows what a xoom is because of the marketing. Every time someone sees my xoom they say \"Oh Cool you have and iPad?\" and I say know this is better than an ipad and if I go on about all the things that are better they are convinced pretty quickly.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I've always been an iPhone guy and was dying to get the I pad. One day my friend got a Samsung Captivate and brought it to class, Micro-Computer Tech. Where we love to get our hands on new devices and see what they can do. Everybody in my class was an IOS freak, with Linux and Windows on their laptops. That one day changed everything for us. I than sold my custom iPhone 4 and went and bought a Motorola ATRIX. Took me a day to realize how amazing the Android operating system really is. However, once I got more into t hardware side, I sold my ATRIX for the new Samsung Galaxy S II for AT&T. But I kept my love for Motorola in mind. This is where I choose the XOOM over the Galaxy Tab.\n\nThe meaning behind that introduction is how easy a perspective on a certain thing can be changed like that.\n\nOn to my review.\n\n-----First impression-----\n\n-Look- Loved it. Feels great in my hands with or without a sleeve. Perfect size in my opinion. Screen size is about as big as my ASUS EEEPC. So I'm use to these screens. My hands are average '' \" for a 5'7\" medium build guy. I have no issues whatsoever.\n\n-Performance- One of my friends put it next to the I pad 2 and did some screen swipes. Kept up with it perfectly. Obviously,the lag with Android systems is a slight lag but nothing really noticeable. With this, I can have 5 tabs in my browser open, music playing and downloading a movie with little hype.\n\n-Apps- This is probably the thing that brings my obsession to a love. The apps are mostly made for phones and smaller screens. However, there IS apps for tablets but not as many. Give it time before more can be developed. For example, I play \"Baseball Superstars II\" on my Galaxy sII but when played on the XOOM, it's like playing a 480 movie on a 1080 full screen. Don't get me wrong, it's still really well but its still to early to hate on the apps. Patience is a vertue.\n\n-----Long Lasting Impression-----\n\nFor sure the XOOM is going to be part of my \"geeky\" toys for a while. Motorola grabbed my attention with the Rokr phone. Best phone I ever had until my Android phone.\n\n------Conclusion------\n\nBUY IT. Hands down."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "In person, the Xoom has an impressively large screen: like an angler with a fish, you feel you need to spread your hands really wide to hold it. In fact, the screen is only just wider, and very slightly thinner than the iPad's; yet the overall effect of the 16:9 aspect ratio (compared to the iPad's 4:3) is that you're holding something that's designed in Cinemascope. This turns out not to work in its favour, but we'll come to that.\n\nTurning it on is just a matter of ... where's the button? For reasons best known to themselves, the Xoom's designers have hidden the power button on the back, on the top left, recessed into the chassis. (Rory Cellan-Jones at the BBC had the same perplexed reaction.) If you need a laugh, hand one to someone who's never held one, and see how long it takes them to find it. One minute is good going, by which time they will have prodded the USB output socket, HDMI output socket, and power input socket, and volume buttons (all of which, sensibly enough, are on the side of the device).\n\nOK, power on. And now we have Honeycomb - Google's 3.0 version of Android. It has clearly been almost completely rethought for a tablet (though there are a couple of leftover references to \"phone\" in the system: rather than the PIN or \"draw a pattern\" screen of an Android phone, you get a padlock sitting in a circle; you have to drag the padlock to the edge. (Neat, though it puzzled some people I tried it on: they pressed the padlock, they pressed the circle, they didn't find the \"pull the padlock to the edge\" idea self-evident.) The default home screen on the Xoom is a deep blue background. As on the Android smartphones, there are five home screens; Honeycomb, though, arranges them in a carousel - you start in the centre, with two empty ones either side to which you can add apps when you swing them around, or use the button in the top right menu.\n\nAnd also in the top right menu, there's a button with \"apps\", which takes you down one level into an \"apps folder\". How does that make sense? Why is Honeycomb giving us a pit into which apps are dumped, while also presenting you with four completely empty screens? It's not as if there are too many apps: the default installation has 24 buried in that folder, while each of the five screens can take at least 48 apps.\n\nThis is bad user interface design which reduces the chance of people using apps - and hence the tablet. Forcing the user to head down into a folder and then make apps return to the surface to use them means you're less likely to find them. Some people (because remember, some people who use computers and tablets are not that savvy) won't notice the \"Apps\" tag in the top right for quite some time. The most powerful setting on any computer is \"default\": it's what most people use most of the time. Google isn't doing itself any favours with the Honeycomb defaults.\n\nThe Xoom does well - it achieved as much as the iPad. Ten hours, more or less - although note that Flash will halve that. You think you don't spend all your time watching Flash? If you open a lot of commercial web pages with adverts or (of course) watch YouTube, you're hitting Flash. More on this later.\n\nFlash aside, the battery life is longer than a typical working day. You can tweak the life by changing how quickly the screen turns off, dimming the screen, turning off Wi-Fi, and so on.\n\nNote though that setting the screen's off delay will mean turning it on a lot - and reaching around for that power button quickly gets tedious. In fact, that back-mounted button is my major criticism of the Xoom itself; yes, it falls under the left index finger if you pick the device up in the correct orientation, but you won't always. And if it's lying down and turns off, picking it up is a pain. Contrast having a button on the front and/or side (both, with the iPad): much easier to activate.\n\nI can also say that OS based it looks like Android was the good choice for this tablet, and i hope they can bring a 7 inch tablet \"Motorola\""}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Having owned my Motorola Xoom for couple of months now, I feel I have used it enough to be able to make a fair appraisal of both the hardware and of the Android operating system.\n\nOut of curiosity (and ignorance), many people have asked me why I chose the Xoom over the iPad? My answer is simple; I am philosophically opposed to supporting the closed and draconian environment offered by Apple. Nevertheless, I did check out the tablet offerings from Toshiba, Acer, Asus, etc., and seriously considered the Asus Transformer, mainly due to its detachable keyboard/stand that houses a secondary battery. Then I realised I'd probably end up using it more like a netbook than as a tablet - and I already have an HP dm1 netbook.\n\nAnyway, I finally settled on the reputation and \"feel\" of the Xoom which also came with a pretty good mobile broadband plan. I understand that tablets are almost exclusively designed for mobile access and consumption of content, not for content creation. Therefore, despite all the \"tablets-killing-the-PC\" rubbish that's being written, I am strongly of the opinion that tablets have a long way to go before they will be a viable replacement for a decent desktop PC or notebook.\n\nThe Hardware:\nSo, what do I like about the Xoom? I'll start with the physical aspects.\n\nI especially like the build quality. The Xoom feels well-made, solid and has good fit and finish. The aluminium casing has a nice quality feel about it. I also like the screen (and no, I have not closely compared it against other tablets using scientific instruments and pixel densitometers). It is nice, bright and clear for my needs. The resolution (1280 x 800) allows for good internet browsing, in both landscape and portrait orientations.\n\nThe Xoom also has a mobile (cellular) SIM slot and (since my Xoom came with Honeycomb 3.1 installed) a working micro SD card slot. So, I can use my Xoom anywhere and expand its storage, if/when needed.\n\nOn the down side, the Xoom is quite heavy to hold for extended periods and the screen is prone to significant reflection as well as fingerprints. I find myself trying to hold it without getting my fingers on the glass, thus, it tends to feel awkward. But that's just me. Holding it would probably be a bit better if I had a rubberised case. Nevertheless, the same can probably be said for other tablets.\n\nI can't do much about the reflectiveness of the screen, but I have purchased and use a Targus tablet stylus (see below) and carry around a screen cloth to reduce the fingerprints and smudges.\n\nThe Xoom has stereo speakers on the back, which I like, along with a 5Mp camera and dual LED flash. Having either one or two LEDs makes no difference to me. As far as I am concerned, ALL LED flashes are useless! This is a moot point, anyway, as I will never be using the Xoom for any serious photography.\n\nBack to the speakers; they can become a little muffled if the tablet is lying on its back (especially on a soft surface). With the thickness of the Xoom, some speaker ports could have been mounted in the edges (like the microphone is on the bottom).\n\nThen there's the on/off switch, which is also on the back. This makes it inconvenient to get to when the tablet is lying flat on its back. In order to turn the Xoom on or off, you must pick it up.\n\nWhile I think of it, I need to mention the charger and charging: although the main power cord is very short (and uses the not-so-common cloverleaf plug), the thinner cable that runs from the power brick is generously long. Oddly, however, the small charging LED on the bottom bezel of the Xoom only works when the Xoom is turned off completely (not when in standby). Weird!\n\nStill on the subject of power, many people have complained that the Xoom won't charge through the USB port. After some investigation, I have discovered that the 5V supplied via a USB port is not enough to charge the two 7.4V, 3250mAh, 24.1Wh lithium ion polymer batteries inside the Xoom. I hope that is clear enough to stop the endless complaints being posted on forums!\n\nAlong with the 5Mp rear-facing camera, there is also a front mounted camera. The pixel-count is irrelevant (I think it is 2Mp) because it is \"adequate\" for its purpose. It apparently works with Google Talk for video conferencing, but significantly (as of early October 2011), it now works with Skype. The reason this is significant is that I don't know ANYONE who uses Google anything (except for searches and throw-away Gmail accounts).\n\nThat rounds out the hardware aspects and leads me nicely into the Android operating system and some of my favourite apps.\n\nThe Software:\nAs mentioned above, my Xoom came preloaded with Honeycomb V3.1 when I purchased it. From what I hear, the previous version (3.0) didn't support the Micro SD card slot. This may have put some people off (actually, it did; LOTS of early adopters whined and bagged the Xoom for this \"omission\" on various forums), but it was probably something to look forward to for others. Either way, it's a non-issue now.\n\nBefore I get into discussing my favourite apps, I shall talk about the underlying Android system. No, I have NOT hacked (rooted) my Xoom and have no real intention to do so.\n\nThus far, Honeycomb has proven to be capable. But the pervasive integration with the Google cloud is a little disconcerting for me. Despite Android being an \"open source\" OS, it is rather obvious that Google has not offered it as a selfless gift to the world. Google do have a strong motivation to host (and analyse) your data. I mean, even with a generous 32Gb of storage memory in the Xoom, Android encourage the user to store pretty much ALL his or her personal data online.\n\nAll your settings, contacts, email, even your photos (Picasa) and documents (Google Docs) can be and often default to being stored (or sync'd) some place online. This may be convenient for some people, but I am a little sceptical.\n\nFor example, there is no way I can delete my email from within the Android Gmail app! I can move email to the \"trash\", but there is no \"Empty Trash\" facility. Actually, there is; you must log into Gmail using a browser on a PC and delete any unwanted email from there.\n\nThankfully, things like \"Back up my data\" (to Google servers) can be turned off, so that's one concession. But there are still many hidden or hard-to-find data synchronisation \"features\".\n\nAll the data collection issues aside, I am pretty happy with Android Honeycomb on the Xoom (i.e. a non-phone device with a decent screen).\n\nJust as a small aside, I am somewhat disappointed (and confused) that I can't seem to send SMS using my Xoom. I mean, it is on a mobile (cellular) network and even has its own number. Also, it appears that I can RECEIVE SMS on the Xoom - mainly because I keep getting messages sent to the previous owner of the mobile number I inherited. Apparently, he/she has run out of credit on his/her toll-road e-tag.\n\nMy mobile data plan for the Xoom is generous enough to be about four times more than I currently seem to need (each month). Therefore, the Mobile Hotspot feature is very welcome. I can simply switch this on and use some of the data allowance on either my HP dm1 or dv7 Windows machines.\n\nWithout going into too much detail (go to the Android market for ratings and feedback, if you're interested), but here are some of my must-have apps. Dropbox and Roboform allow me to have my current working documents an ALL my passwords available everywhere. PocketCloud allows me remote access to my home PC (and others). Skype goes without saying and Documents To Go (full), CamScanner (full), Amazon Kindle Reader, and Camera Zoom FX are all highly recommended for the Xoom (or any Android Tablet).\n\nAccessories:\nThe Xoom is a great device, but there are some accessories that make it even better. I've listed below what I feel are worthy of my money.\n\nTargus 10.2\" Netbook case\nThis \"case\" is actually designed for a netbook, but fits the Xoom nicely. It has a pocket on the front for other accessories (such as my fold up Bluetooth keyboard and stand - see below). It is well padded and comes with a sling to make it into a nice \"man-purse\", if that's your \"bag\".\n\nTargus Stylus\nAs stated above, the shiny screen is prone to considerable smudging. Therefore, I have purchased a stylus from Targus. It works well and mitigates fingerprints and smudges. The only drawback is that a single styllus is not capable of multi-touch gestures. But multi-touch gestures aren't used that regularly for me, at least. Disappointingly, like many other manufacturers, Targus don't seem to recognise that there are any alternatives to iPads. All their marketing material and packaging refers exclusively to the iPad, despite the stylus working just as well on most other tablet screens.\n\nBelkin FlipBlade stand\nAs with the Targus stylus, the Belkin FlipBlade stand is marketed exclusively for use with an iPad. Nevertheless, it is perfect for the Xoom. The spring-loaded soft-opening mechanism is nice, although a little slow. I also like the protective rubber padding which I know will prevent any damage to my Xoom.\n\nAlthough the angle of the stand cannot be altered, it opens to a very good angle for desktop work. The stand is stable in both landscape and portrait orientations. Compared to the far-too-upright angle of the Motorola standard dock (see below), the Belkin is by far the better choice while actually using your Xoom.\n\nMotorola Standard Dock\nThis dock is useful for simply charging your Xoom. It does have a speaker out port and stands your Xoom upright to avoid damage. However, the angle is too vertical to be able to use the Xoom on a desk. There isn't any facility to adjust the angle, either.\n\nI guess it would be OK if you had a shelf or higher-than-usual location for watching videos (with some external speakers), but on a desktop, it is restricted to a recharging role.\n\nThink Outside Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard\nThe Stowaway keyboard is quite and old product. I can't remember when it was that I bought it, but it has to be more than six or seven years ago. I am pretty sure it iis no longer available - if the company (Think Outside) still even exists.\n\nNevertheless, it is a good product and does an excellent job as a keyboard for the Xoom. Once paired up (and a few settings in Android have been tweaked) it connects and works flawlessly. Yes, its compact design takes some getting used to, such as the layout of the alternate keys, etc.\n\nAs stated above, I have no real motivation to use my Xoom for any serious content creation or even editing, however, in an emergency, it is MUCH better than any on-screen keyboard.\n\nMonster ScreenClean\nNot really an accessory, but worthy of mention. The cleaning fluid and cloth are specifically designed for modern screens. A very small amount of the cleaning fluid is all that's necessary to get all the marks off the screen. I often only need to wipe the screen over with the special cloth, without any fluid for satisfactory results."}

The iOS is nice for people who aren't necessarily tech savy. Android is for the more technical minded. So with phones, so with tablets. What I like most is the control. With a file manager app, I can watch movies and play music off my network share at home. I can add/remove files at will over wifi. Things I found disappointingly convoluted in iOS. I hated having to go through iTunes just to copy an MP3 onto my device. My Xoom has Honeycomb on it now and is super quick. It plays Flash. It has a great camera.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Simply put, this was one of the best purchases I ever made from Amazon.\n\nWhen the Motorola Xoom was introduced on the market last year I wanted one but didn't want to pay the $800 Verizon price tag.  So as with all technology, if you just give it some time the price will drop.  Unfortunately Verizon still carried a hefty price (in my opinion) because they didn't sell the wi-fi only model.  After checking the various retailers and other on-line merchants, Amazon had exactly what I was looking for.\n\nIn the end I purchased my Xoom for $432, with a leather case ($7), additional charger ($15), and upgraded it with an additional 32gb Sandisk micro-SD ($41). Thus completing my entire purchase for $495 (comparatively $866 at VZ).  And since I live in a Metropolitan area that has Xfinity wi-fi access 98% of everywhere I go, I saw no need for an additional $480 2yr data plan ($20p/mo x24mo).  You can do the math and compare as well.\n\nI work in management as an IT Operations Specialist, so I get to test various tech.  As a promotion, we received the Apple iPad, Blackberry Playbook, HP TouchPad, Google Chromebook and Motorola Xoom to test for Traveling Sales Reps.  For a month we put each device through a series of tests, including responsiveness, versatility, compatibility with internal sites and customer web pages as well as the availability of supported apps from their respective markets.\n\nOverall the Xoom prevailed, as we could easily deploy a packaged device with our supported apps (including Adobe Flash), and didn't require a valid credit card for access to an Apps Library.  The battery life, cost and memory upgrade availability was also important.  Another feature we liked was the ability to manage documents anywhere on the device.  The only downfall was the proprietary charger.\n\nAll-in-all the Motorola Xoom is an excellent tablet for business as well as personal use at a reasonable price."}

I researched my options for several months, and it came down to the iPAD 2 and the XOOM. I have a family member who has the ipad 2 and I had concluded that I did not enjoy the file structure (since you can only use the files within the program you place them in) and therefore began researching more about the XOOM, and began ti fall in love with it. I have 32 gb on board and now with Android Honeycomb 3.1 the availability of up to a 32 gb sd card, giving me 64 gb total. The viewing angles are great and the app are growing every week. I also enjoy how it renders the phone apps. The ipad 2 provides an enlargement feature with horrible rendering while the XOOM provides a full screen environment with a relativily smooth look. One more selling point was that I am also a DROID 2 Global user so it provides me with manufacturer consistancy.\n\nIf you are already an Android user this is a great tablet. If you are an iphone user you will probably enjoy the ipad 2 better. If you are an iPhone user and wish to try a different mobile OS experience this is a great product to try."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "After reading many reviews of many products online I decided that the Xoom was the product I would like to purchase.  The only real draw back that I saw about it was weight.  Once receiving the item I was happy to see that it is not that heavy at all.  In fact I think it feels like a very well constructed tablet.  My Wife is the main user of this tablet and I have rarely seen her without it since we opened the box.  The kids love to play their games on it as well.  I won't bother repeating all of the specifications that a typical review has but what sealed it for me was front and rear facing camera (only works with Google Talk currently not Skype), expandable memory through micro-sd slot to 64GB, and up gradable to 3g/4g if you decide you need more than wi-fi.  Only real drawback is you can't pre-load the sd card, you have to use the usb cable to transfer data.  Guess they want you to use their clouds for your data storage and this is a gentle push in that direction."}

I asked if they were used or refurbished and they said no. So I immediately took one. I started ot play with it (of course after the updates) and my gosh it is a beautiful device. Some people are particularly picky about camera quality, apps, etc, but to be honest it I don't see them. It is smooth, responsive, and very versatile. Will it replace a laptop? Hell no. But it can replace your cellular data in an instant. You can do so much with this.\n\nMy sister having an iPad 2 compared it. We both came to the conclusion that they are just two different devices. Two different OS, two different pros, two different cons. It just depends on how you experience it in your own hands. Apple users will love the iPad, Android users will love the Xoom/Galaxy Tab/etc. As my experience with this tablet, it is awesome. But my advice is to go into a store and try them out yourself. You will never know what you like from an internet review."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "For people who know how to use their tablet to the fullest extent, you cannot go wrong with the Xoom. Now, people compare it to the iPad or even the iPad 2, which I don't really consider a fair comparison because it is more like comparing oranges to apples. (don't hate me for that pun)\n\nPerformance:\nYou have two 1 GHz Tegra 2 cores powering this tablet. If you like the idea of hooking together two android cell phones and utilizing that increased performance, the Xoom is perfect for you. You will have power for all but the most intensive applications (I doubt you would be crunching folding@home or processing 3D images on a tablet). You are not going to see something as snappy as a top of the line computer in terms of responsiveness, but it does very well when you remember that you are running off of a lithium-ion battery and not a constant power supply from the wall. You won't see much better performance from similarly powered tablets. Now, mine is overclocked to 1.4GHz, so it starts to rival net-books as it is. More on this later.\n\nDisplay:\nThis is a great looking display! It is a very clear display when you have applications that can run natively at the full resolution of the Xoom. I haven't used enough tablets to compare display clarity, but I have no qualms whatsoever about the display. The backlight for the LCD might not be powerful enough on a bright day outside, but inside it works just fine. Do beware, the display attracts smudges, which may give away your lock pattern if you aren't careful.\n\nEase of use:\nThis is where the Xoom tends to fall a little bit. It has no hardware buttons aside from the volume and power buttons. Everything else is software based, meaning you need to touch part of the screen to go back, go to the home screen, choose between recently used applications, and start a search. This was slightly jarring coming from an android phone that has all four of these as hardware buttons. However, its a minor gripe, and it doesn't take up much space, and lots of apps hide them during use anyways. Now, this is also where people like to bring up Apple and claim it has a better user interface. Honestly, if you can't figure out the Xoom's interface, I don't understand how you would figure out an iPad's interface, especially having just the one hardware button, meaning you need to find more software buttons to navigate around apps (you get used to this with the Xoom since it is completely software based buttons). The only saving grace it has is that the iPod Touch has a similar interface, so it is more familiar. I was already familiar with the android interface, so the Xoom was relatively easy once I got used to software buttons to control the tablet.\n\nApps:\nNow, this is a bit of a debate. While iOS has more apps due to the perceived (and actual) popularity of iOS and more compatibility (only iPod Touch and iPad devices run iOS - just 2 hardware platforms to code for) of the apps, Apple filters out applications it does not like using whatever their criteria is. The android marketplace only filters out applications that violate laws or are considered obscene or potentially threatening to hardware, software, or privacy (aka viruses, malware, keyloggers). Apps may not work across all android devices, but they are much more open and are not restricted to an overseer which gives a final stamp of approval. You pay your one-time fee to gain access to developer tools and the ability to release apps on the market, and you get free reign to write whatever you want. The android market has much more potential than the iOS market to have something you want, but more developers are focused on iOS since its perceived (and has a noticeable actual) market generates more money.\n\nCustomization:\nAgain, not trying to defeat the iPad here, but I laugh at the notion of customizing an iOS device. Android devices are extremely customizable, and with open-source code available to developers (not all firmwares, but a fair amount of them), there are customized ROMs that allow even more custom settings, wallpapers, sounds, etc. As I alluded to earlier, this is what enables overclocking of the Xoom. With the source code being available, you or someone you know that can create code for android firmware can give you access to changing just about anything to the Xoom.\n\nOverall:\nThe Xoom is one of the best tablets out there. If you can get past the software buttons and fingerprints/smudges along with the android layout, you will not be let down."}

Because the model I got can't be updated past 3.1 of Honeycomb, it is worthless to me and dated right out of the box.  There will obviously be future updates to Honeycomb and now there is Ice Cream Sandwich, but this tablet will not be able to install them.

Each time such occurrence would  take place, I would be forced to wait for the tablet to fully discharge before being able to restart it again!

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I am not a big Apple fan but have used and iPod touch for about a year so am very familiar with the Apple OS. I was eager to try this tablet given it was the first to use the new tablet centric Android OS. I wanted it to be as good as Apple's but the truth is, it isn't. Despite having Flash support (which Apple does not), Android Honeycomb is just not nearly as smooth or as trouble free as Apple iOS. In the month I have used the tablet, I have had one serious hard crash that nearly had me sending the tablet back. That's because the recovery process is so arcane, it would be nearly impossible to figure out without detailed instructions, which I eventually found on the net. It involved interpreting a series of obscure error messages, engaging a series of timed button pushes (power, vol up, vol down) in the correct sequence and then the navigation of a somewhat clunky text menu system (reminds me of the old DOS command line system). The good news is I brought the tablet back to life. The bad news is should not have have been nearly this difficult. The Touch has crashed plenty but always comes back with a simple forced reboot.  Xoom forced reboot procedure did not work in my case. Had to do a factory reset from boot, which is much more complicated.)\nBut on to the usability issues. Xoom works fine in the broad sense of the word. It basically does everything the Apple OS does and them some. But it's not quite as smooth. Pans are sometimes herky jerky. Oreintation changes are slower than on the Apple. Overall, just not as polished, which is what you would expect when you compare a 6 month old OS with a years-old one. Still, the Xoom suffers a bit in the comparison. I might be able to overlook this if not for another problem. The library of aps simply is not as good on the Xoom as in the Apple universe. There are a precious few Android aps built just for the Tablet and even when they are, they sometimes offer far less funtionality than than the corresponding Apple version. Prime example: CNBC's excellent financial ap. It's amazing in the Apple version, providing tons of functionality. The Android version is a bare bones sibling, with about one-tenth the functionality of even the one for the iPhone. Since it's all about the aps in the smartphone/tablet world, this will be a real deal killer for some folks. I expect the Android landscape will improve in time but it falls way short for now.\nThat said, there are some areas where a tablet is a big improvement over a smartphone. Notably, reading books, newspapers and magazines. The preloaded Google books ap is excellent, with realistic page turns and all the functionality you would expect of a reader. There are also several notable tablet centric news aps, including USA Today and Pulse. Both take advantage of the extra screen real estate to make selecting and reading stories easier.\nWatching movies is also much better on the Xoom's bigger screen but there is no comparable iTunes environment in the Android universe to port over digital copies. You must rely on streaming or getting a version is the correct format and copying over as a playable file.\nXoom also offers the advantage of a micro-SD slot, notably missing on the Apple products, and a micro HDMI port for porting movies to an HDTV. It also has better front and read facing cameras than the iPad. Screen resolution also is better, if you are just reading the specs. In real life, however, it seems most people like the output of the iPad a little better.\nOne other issue: Sound quality is somewhat lacking compared to my iPod Touch. I use a bluetooth headset and sound quality is noticably better in the iPod than on the Xoom.\nBottom line: If you can get one of these things at a huge discount, as I did, you might want to consider it. The official $499 retail for the 32-gig wi-fi only model is still way too much in my view, especially with Amazon's much cheaper Fire about to debut. You might as well go with an Apple model if you are going to spend that much. If the price drops into the $350 range, it becomes much more competitive."}

It's limited in what it can do compared to a computer but it's better than a phone (and Angry Birds is much better at the larger size.)Someone said it's a fingerprint magnet and that's true but for about $11 including shipping you can get a stylus that solves that problem. My only complaint is I wish they had used the same USB charging port that everything else is coming with these days."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "My husband bought me a xoom for my birthday last spring.  I hadn't asked for it, and really wasn't sure it was something that I'd ever use... but let me tell you-  I use it EVERY DAY, and for things that I hadn't ever thought I would.  The biggest surprise was how much I use the camera and video recorder, and how often and easy it is to share video and pictures with others.  When I visit my relatives out of town, it is as easy as pulling out the xoom and pulling up gallery to show them the latest things happening in our family's life.  It is truly changing the way that I interact... I mean, I've had a camcorder and a phone that takes pics forever... but this really simplifies things for SHARING the photos with others (ie., there's need to upload to a computer, and no need to have a tv/computer).  I have a really nice leather case for it (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Bear-Motion-Trademark-100-Real-Leather-Case-for-For-Motorola-Xoom-10-1-inch-tablet-3G-4G-WI-FI-16-GB-32-GB-64-GB-Xoom-Case-Google-Android-3-0-Honeycomb-Black/dp/B004ZAZMKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Bear Motion (Trademark) 100% Real Leather Case for For Motorola Xoom 10.1 inch tablet (3G & 4G WI-FI 16 GB 32 GB 64 GB) - Xoom Case Google Android 3.0 Honeycomb Black</a>), and I take it everywhere I go in my purse.\nPROS:\n1.  Video and camera are simply great features to have.\n\n2.  I like the instant upload for google+ for videos and photos.  Very nice to know that there is a copy that won't be lost, and very nice for sharing with others!\n\n3.  gmail integration is awesome.\n\n4.  Google Body is incredible.\n\n5.  Like having the microSD card to store music on.\n\n6.  I have not compared the body integrity to other tablets, but the xoom has held up pretty well for me for the last 4 mos, and I am pretty hard on things.  I accidentally dropped it(more like threw from my hands)from a standing position to the cement garage floor... and there was THANKFULLY no damage at all.  It was in the case and landed flat.\n\nCONS:\nThat being said, there are a few things that could definitely be improved:\n1.  The gallery app is really limited in that it doesn't allow picture tagging or any taxonomy for sorting and organizing photos.  Please- just make it like Picasa!\n\n2.  The video app is disappointing in that it doesn't allow any zooming in (AT ALL) or pause functionality.  The camera does zoom, the video does not.\n\n3.  The biggest problem with the hardware is that there is NO WAY to have an external microphone hookup, and the internal one is pretty limited. It doesn't help that the microphone is not very well placed for recording events 'behind' the screen (the normal way), as it is right at the bottom of the xoom, and if the xoom is in a case, the cover of the case often hangs down and blocks the sound path, making the sounds muffled. If you want to record your child's concert debut, the xoom will not likely be a great device.\n\n4.  Really hard to use cameras outside due to glare.  Not sure if there is a way to get around this...\n\n5.  It is a shame that xfinity will not work on the xoom (yet?- there is an app, but the android os doesn't support silverlight, and so the app is not for on-demand viewing, but just to change the channel on the tv... ie., totally USELESS)... although I suppose if it worked, I would never get anything productive done again!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I'm always baffled by the minutiae that people complain about.  As computer tablets become more popular, the height of nitpicking seems to have moved into the stratosphere.\n\nLike many others here, I churned through several Android tablets (Asus, Toshiba, then Xoom) to find one that I really liked. I tried to keep my expectations aligned with the reality of yet another new gadget coming onto the market.  I don't have negative feelings toward Apple, although I refuse to pay the 50-100% premium that many of their products command.  I was going to buy an iPad, and spent quite a bit of time testing and playing with both friend's iPads, as well as at the Apple store.  It is truly sexy hardware, but the software has a toylike quality to it that doesn't suit my more geeky brain.\n\nI have an android phone, and am definitely enjoying it, even though it has its quirks.  I'm not religious about technology, nor am I brand loyal to any company. I'll try just about anything. So on to my opinions about the Xoom.\n\nHardware:  Just beautiful, and wreaks of quality.  The fit and finish is truly premium.  It feels good in your hands.  There are some quirks, like the cheesy charging port, that is destined to break.  Also, the MicroSD card slot is about as idiotic design as I've ever seen (its like brain surgery to remove the \"dummy\" card and insert the real one).  I like the on off switch location, it feels good in the hand when you pick it up.\n\nScreen: Also beautiful.  I am always baffled at how people complain about fingerprints...  Its a FINGER tablet for goodness sake.  You use your FINGERS to operate it.  OMG.  Yep, its a little shiny, so there can be a tad of glare when around certain kinds of lighting.  But its really no big deal, you can just move it a millimeter one way or another and its fine.\n\nResponsiveness:  Very fast, especially now with the 3.2 update.  I just like how things work.\n\nSoftware:  I actually think the tablet build of Android feels smoother and more natural than the phone build does.  Its nicely suited to the enhanced real estate of the tablet, whereas it now feels cramped on the phone.  I like Motorola's corporate sync feature, which works well with my Exchange server. The Google browser is decent, syncs with Chrome bookmarks, although it takes forever.  Android market is getting better every week, and I really like Amazon's Android appstore\n\nFunctionality:  It does everything nearly all computers do.  The touchscreen experience is wayyyy different than the keyboard experience.  I never reach for it if I'm going to type something, but use it for email reading, web browsing, and miscellaneous stuff.  Games are decent, but not all are set up for tablet form factors yet.\n\nOverall:  The Xoom is great.  Other than a couple of hardware quirks, its a stellar device.  Android for tablets is more technical than Apple's tablet software, which is one reason I'm drawn to it.  I find it extremely flexible, as well as very suitable for business use.  Its like anything else, you need to get used to any new complicated software based product, before you really know whether you and it will get along.  Android does have a way to go before its brainless like Apples operating environment, but all in all its really nice, especially if you like tinkering."}

Don't be pulled into the I pad hype when you can have a Xoom.  I have the wifi only one and love it.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "This is my second Android tablet (well, third, if you count a hacked Nook Color). The first was the Asus Transformer. While the Transformer is a lovely device, it has a large black bezel surrounded by a smaller metal band.  I have small hands even for a girl, and the Transformer was too large for me to comfortably hold one handed. The Xoom has been criticized for its weight, but to me the weight is offset by its (at least compared to the Transformer) slim profile. I like the way it tapers to the edges, which makes the tablet feel and handle like its smaller than it really is. The Xoom is a bit rough, even after the 3.2 update, but not so much so that it is unusable or even unpleasant to use.  I think most of the issues stem from apps that don't play nicely with honeycomb.  The camera is actually decent, more so than most smartphones I have used. The photos are clear and have good color. Its only weak spot is that it doesn't handle movement so well. Your subject needs to be relatively still to get a truly quality photo. But all in all, still good for a tablet camera. The internals of the Xoom are pretty much par for the course right now.  It sports the dual core processor, 1gb ram, and as an added bonus 32gb of storage unlike its similarly priced competitors and their 16gb of memory.  All in all I recommend this tablet to both the experienced modder (it runs vanilla aosp for your hacking and flashing pleasure), and to the novice because honey come is well structured and thought out. Its no iOS in terms of ease of use, but with a little time its easy to learn.  4 stars."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "After much research, laptop vs. tablet, Ipad vs. Galaxy, Xoom and others I decided on the Xoom wi-fi because of price, capacity 32gb, external ports, customer reviews,  and a review in Forbes plus I already have an Android phone.  Flash was also a factor in my decision, which Apple has a big problem with, it needs to be installed separately from the apps market, but no big deal and it's free.\n\nSetup was very easy and navigation is a snap because of my familiarity with Android. I've ported over my music from my PC (iTunes songs, not the program) and the music player that came with the Xoom is pretty good, internal speakers are good but I am using external with an xmod and the sound is rich. The Xoom is a little heftier than the I pad but for most users it shouldn't make a difference. I decided on Wi-Fi only because of availability of Wi-Fi hot spots at home and work, where I'll be using the Xoom most of the time, plus I didn't need another monthly Verizon bill.  The keyboard response is good, as is the orientation swing from landscape to portrait. Setting up external email is simple and overall for semi technically proficient user like me, the Xoom is a good choice and ready to use right out of the box with minimal hassle. I'm still exploring all the different features but my experience so far has been positive.\n\nMy recommendation for anyone looking at a tablet is to give serious consideration to Motorola's Xoom, especially if you are familiar with the Android operating system."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have had the Xoom for about a month now and I must confess that the reviews I read on amazon and other reviews helped me choose rightly between the Xoom and others.\n\nFirstly, when I bought the Apple ipad in May for my Wife as a gift I was miffed to discover that my country of residence - Nigeria was not on the list of countries I could register my credit/debit card. This made it difficult to get important apps to make the ipad functional for her.\n\nSecondly, I have used the ipod for a long time and I cannot stand having to use itunes for every single thing. To my dismay, the ipad is similarly tied to itunes and makes it very difficult to use especially in a place like Nigeria.\n\nSo I had to look for an alternative and the Xoom has not disappointed at all!!! I am enjoying it every day and it seems to have offer something new when I try it out.\n\nThe only challenge I have for now is I have not been able to use the usb port because it requires some activation which is proving difficult to download in Nigeria.\n\nOn the whole, I am enjoying it to the max and can't help comparing it everyday with my wife's ipad (wish I had bought her a Xoom instead :-(\n\nOne reviewer compared the ipad to a game of checkers and the Xoom to Chess..

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Let me start off by saying like most people in the market for a tablet, I did the usual Xoom vs Galaxy Tab vs iPad 2 comparisons. Looked at a bunch of reviews as well as pros/cons against each other.\n\nAs I was reading through these comparisons/reviews I noticed something. A lot of these expert reviews really didn't rate the Xoom high because of the price. Purely looking at specs and using the device, there are mostly good things about the Xoom.\n\nSince now the price has gone down to around $450. The only real con of the high price is no longer a factor.\n\nAfter reading countless reviews/opinions for weeks from average users to expert critics, it basically comes down to your own preference. I doubt you will regret your decision if you purchased either the Xoom or the iPad. If you love surfing the web, you will fall in love with the Xoom for it's bigger real estate and very fast browsing speed. I mean I have a pretty fast laptop with an SSD with 8 gigs of ram but the web pages just comes up faster on the Xoom. If you are more into apps, then ipad would probably be a better choice for you.\n\nI also have a bad problem about buying electronics and never using it. You know those impulse purchases. Everyone is getting this new toy and you buy one but rarely use it. I went through that when I bought a portable media player as well as a netbook. So naturally I was worried that this tablet will be just collecting dust.\n\nLet me put your mind at ease. I use the Xoom more than my laptop, netbook, ipod, and smartphone. It does just about everything. In the past the netbook would be the \"go-to\" device for surfing the web, but since the Xoom is always up and running, I can browse the web in matter of seconds. I love my smartphone, but let's be real, surfing the web on a 4 inch screen really sucks. My laptop is powerful but when I'm on the couch watching TV, the Xoom really comes in handy since I can just put it right next to me on the couch.\n\nBottom line is I really didn't expect to get so much use out of this tablet but I was dead wrong. Think of it this way, you are always connected to the internet with the Xoom. If you love web browsing, hands down this is the right tablet for you."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I love my Xoom. I did a lot of research trying to decide the best tablet for them money. Before I started my research I was convinced that I would be getting and iPad but I had to research my options just in case.  I ended up purchasing the Xoom (pronounced Zoom just in case you are wondering...I was curious so I looked it up on the Motorola website)and I totally do not regret it.  There are four main reasons  why I choose the Xoom over the iPad 2. These reasons are not in any particular order.\n\n1. Cost: I purchased the WiFi only Xoom with the 32gig of memory for just over $500 from walmart (I was to impatient to wait for shipping so I was willing to pay a little more and have it right them). The 32Gig, Wifi only, iPad 2 from walmart was about $600. The 32gig Xoom is the same price as the 16gig iPad. I did not purchase the Xoom just because it was cheaper.\n\n2. The Xoom has a microSD card slot. I put in a 16gig card so now I have 48gigs of memory. Do I love the was the Xoom handles the microSD, well no. It is not as user friendly as I'd like it to be but I am willing to bet that it will get better as time goes on.\n\n3.  I like Adobe Flash. I think it it cool and the iPad can't...and probably won't use Flash.\n\n4. I prefer the Android market. I iPad market is way to proprietary for me. I agree that there are not as many apps available in the Android market as there is in the Apple market...but the Apple products (iPhone, iPod, iPad...) have been around a lot longer that the Android market.  It is only natural that there would be more available. So far, there hasn't been a single thing that I've wanted to do on my Xoom that I haven't be able to find an app for. The Android market is in full speed and I don't doubt that it will surpass the Apple market very soon."}

But I messed up by tying my tablet to a contract at Verizon and I don't think this machine is very durable.  Unfortunately, after three months, my Motorolla Xoom stopped working.  After discussion with their tech support (they speak very little english) and mailing it to Motorolla, I received a check the box response saying it had received water damage.  Now had I dropped it in the toilet, been caught in the rain, or watched it immersed in a glass of water I dropped on the table next to it, I would have said, \"my fault\" and bought another one.  Unfortunately, my Xoom never was immersed in water or any of that.  It just stopped working.  What event caused that, I have no clue but neither my wife or I can determine what would have been the event.\n\nNot really happy with Motorolla or Verizon at this point.

I think the 16x10 screen ratio is great, the screen looks quite good, the sound is good, and it's fast. However, the plugs are not in great locations, it's not as light as the iPad or some others, and I kind of wish the on/off button was not on the back. I think the hardware is more of a 3.5. I'm sure other manufacturers will improve on the hardware. Overall, I am VERY happy that I got this instead of an iPad 2. The software is the best on the market (sorry Apple) and the hardware is acceptable."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "To further quote Jimi Hendrix... 'well, I have'.\n\nI've been using a XOOM for about a month or so after experiencing a couple of other Honeycomb tablets and I had the opportunity to play around with the latest iPad for a weekend. I thought I'd say this because the XOOM is the tablet I am going to keep - not an easy thing because there are 3 kids around who'd run and hide with it every time they got an opportunity. I am not saying that the XOOM is perfect, far from it - and I will discuss its imperfections shortly - but, as tablets go in the second half of of 2011, the XOOM met and it occasionally exceeded my expectations more often than the other brands I tried. The disappointments were few and non-essential.\n\nAfter a couple of months with tablets I can say that using one CAN be a fun and rewarding experience IF one's expectations are realistic therefore...\n\nWHAT NOT TO EXPECT\n\nDo not believe the technical press hype announcing the imminent demise of the PC at the hands of the all-mighty tablet. PCs as we know them today may disappear eventually but not because of tablets as we know them today and this is why:\n\n- Tablets, XOOM included, don't or won't replace PCs or laptops, not for a long time, in the same way PCs didn't replace or displace calculators and Tweets (hopefully) won't replace poetry. Trying to choose between a tablet and a PC/laptop is a false choice. While my XOOM and my T400 laptop can live happy and separate lives, my (computing) life would be impossible with just the XOOM and, now that I've been using it for several weeks, I would miss my XOOM if it disappeared from my life but I could probably live without one.\n- The on-screen keyboard can't replace the physical thing. It CAN be used to write brief notes or messages but between a tablet keyboard, even one with auto-fill and even the much smaller Blackberry physical alternative, I prefer the physical one. I'm using a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard with my XOOM when I need to 'really' type something and I don't feel like picking up my laptop.\n- Touch is fun but it's not a mouse. Consider that your index finger is way bigger than the mouse pointer's 'point' and the tablet screen is much smaller. Touch works better than mouse in some instances like in pinch-zoom and scrolling but not in most instances.\n- Of the 'hundreds of thousands' there are not a lot of 'serious' or full-featured apps at this time at least when it comes to 'creating' content as opposed to playing/consuming it. Tablets are limited by their specific interfaces and by their horsepower even though they do come with features (GPS, compass, thermometer, barometer) not commonly found in PCs. For example, the official 'Adobe Photoshop Express' I downloaded offers less than 1% of what you are likely to find in the 'real' Photoshop. It's ingeniously adapted to 'touch' but if you really wanted to edit your pics, you'd probably pick the real thing.\n- Due to their size, tablets can't and won't be replacing postage stamp-size MP3 players that can store thousands of songs AND fit in one's shirt pocket.\n- Streaming to a tablet from a media server may be possible but the tablet's tiny speakers can't deliver a rewarding listening experience. Sure, you can add some speakers but the more you add to a tablet (speakers, keyboard, mouse...) the less of a tablet it becomes.\n- It's possible to add a physical keyboard, a mouse or touch pad and even connect a larger display to the tablet but then... we'd end up with yet another netbook or a mini-laptop.\n\nWHY A TABLET\n\nAnd yet tablets are magical and I'm having more fun with mine. And here's why:\n\n- The XOOM sits to the left of my keyboard in the morning, playing the morning news shows while I'm having breakfast and reading my email.\n- There is this app that has over a thousand old movies and I often play one at lunch.\n- I'm making phone calls and video calls. My PC and my laptop can do that too but I now prefer to do my calls on the tablet while the PC does what PCs do best - crunch spreadsheet numbers, help me write and edit long documents and edit pictures and video to near-perfection.\n- At night, me and the kids learn about the stars, thanks to one free app that takes advantage of the tablet's built-in GPS and compass, showing the stars and constellations exactly as we see them and showing their names.\n- My 8 yr. old daughter finds playing math games with a stylus a lot more fun than pencil and paper or PC-based math drills.\n- There is an enormous amount of mostly-free games that kids like to play on the XOOM, many of them mind-bending puzzles which should be good for them.\n- If you are one of the passengers, it's fun to watch the satellite view or the street view of the places you're driving through.\n- It's got 3-4 times the battery life of my current laptop.\n\nXOOM vs. THE OTHERS\n\nLet me begin with what I 'like':\n\n- It's Wi-Fi and it's not 3G or 4G. In other words I pay less, I don't worry about 'usage' and I'm free to use my tablet as I please. I thought I'd mentioned that because  every single listing in Amazon's app store comes with the disclaimer stating that \"AT&T has enabled purchases from the Amazon Appstore for some devices\". And that's a shame - being at the mercy of someone you actually pay to provide a service not to boss you around. AT&T has zero control over my Wi-Fi XOOM.\n- It's an Android and that means freedom or at least more freedom than the iWorld. I can download and run anything I want and nobody can stop me from doing so. Sure, freedom implies some risks but... it's so much sweeter than the uniform world of 'managed' so-called eco- (or is it echo) systems.\n- The XOOM is a PURE Android. There are no phone-company super-imposed overlays and, after trying a couple other tablets, I found that I like it this way.\n- The XOOM happens to be an extraordinarily well-built tablet. Solid as a rock, as far as tablets go.\n- Accessorizing is easy and inexpensive. Any Bluetooth keyboards and headsets work well but haven't tried a mouse yet.\n\nNow, for what is not so great:\n\n- The charge port is at the bottom, meaning that you can't easily charge your tablet while it's on a stand. Sure, you can turn it upside down but and end up with the ports at the top but a charge port on one side would have been a lot better.\n- Can't use it outside at all other than as a mirror. The display is a highly-reflective glass. It looks great indoors and indoors only.\n- The fingerprints. Every touch leaves a visible print on the screen. You must either train yourself to ignore them, wipe the display every few minutes or use a stylus. I'm using a stylus myself and I'm wiping it often.\n- And, talking about 'stylus'. It would have been so nice if the XOOM came with a stylus storage compartment, the way DSi's do.\n- A little heavy for reading in bed. But I have a Kindle for that and it's in no danger of being replaced by the XOOM.\n\nMY RATING\n\nI like the XOOM and I'm using it every day now even though I don't have to. And I suspect that the kids - who all have their own laptops - like it more because every time I put it down they pick it up. I am happy with it because I don't expect it to replace my laptop, my big screen TV or my home server. The XOOM and tablets are ideal for casual entertainment but can't do what more powerful and more dedicated devices can deliver. The XOOM is fun in the way a bike is fun. It's great riding it but you won't go shopping or take your family on a 60-mile trip to the beach on a bicycle.\n\nI will grant my XOOM its five stars because I truly love it and Amazon's 5-star rating stands for 'I love it'. It doesn't mean that the XOOM is perfect or that using it isn't frustrating from time to time. It only means that I love it and I'm glad I got mine.\n\nP.S. - for best results, I'd recommend accessorizing with a stand, a Bluetooth keyboard, a stylus and a couple of microfiber cloths.\n\n______________________________________________\n\nAug 10, 2011 Update\n\nApparently the XOOM just earned Apple's seal of approval. The XOOM and Samsung's Tab 10.1 are the 2 tablets Apple is trying to get banned in Europe."}

I went into best buy and I didn't want any low quality Asus or Acer stuff so I decided to narrow it down to Samsung and xoom. I was dead set on Samsung but it has two low amount of memory and the xoom was a clear winner with that in mind bc for the same price you get a16gb Samsung you can get xoom for 32gbwith room for more in the future. Also xoom is the tablet that will be the first to receive updates. Samsung is still stuck on 3.1 while Solomon runs 3.2 which lets you resize apps made only for phones. Also best buy had all the accessories for half of as of 8/2/2011 so I got the xoom Bluetooth  keyboard and portfolio case for 54 plus tax. It also runs flash beautifully with a free update to 10.3 also xoom charges faster than Samsung as xoom takes about an hour while Sammy takes up to 4. Samsung dies have a beautiful screen and is hell of a lot thinner ans a little lighter. But as don't sacrifice what makes an android an android by purchasing it. Not SD card no HDMI no USB mass storage mount, one propitiatory connection sounds more like apple. Xoom is a better deal. My sister called me an idiot for explaining her why I was sacrificing a larger memory and SD card for a thinner tablet. She was like\" REALLY when your okay with carrying your laptop in one hand your complaining about how one is thin er than the other and how it is a little heavy. They both weigh less than a laptop and you know your gonna fill it up with music movies PDFs and book.\" So that's it that was my reason why I got the xoom. Hope you would do the same. Sorry bout typos sitll getting used to the tablets keypad."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I own an iPad 1 and was very skeptical about buying a non-iPad.  I took the plunge to buy a wi-fi only Xoom, and I'm glad that I did.  I still love my iPad.  However, I always believe in being open-minded to new things.  One of the things that made me choose Xoom over other non-Apple tablets is its better price and features, Xoom has a GPS chip (while other non-Apple tablets don't have GPS), Xoom has a larger screen than iPad, it has a memory card slot and it's not an Apple product.  I like Xoom because it feels more like using a typical computer, compared to an appliance-like iPad - not that having a computer behaving like a reliable appliance is bad, however.  Here are some of the observations I have:  Xoom's touch screen seems a bit less responsive than iPad 1; Apps written for Xoom don't seem to work as well as the same apps that run on iPad; there are nowhere as many apps for Xoom than the iPad; I have to pay to have the same apps I purchased on iPad so that I can make my Xoom as closely resembles my iPad in functionality; I now have to invest in a car charger for Xoom; no Netflix on Xoom yet at this time; Xoom battery seems to run out faster when using a GPS application, compared to the iPad 1; there are no cool built-in effects for the cameras.  Essentially, owning Xoom is almost like owning a PC, and owning an iPad is like owning an Apple computer.  I feel it is essential to have an alternative to iPad.  Xoom has so much potential, and I can't wait for more apps to be available for Xoom.\n\nUPDATE:  Netflix is available but it seems unofficially available.  The video quality of Netflix on Xoom is very poor compared to Netflix on iPad.  Hopefully an official release Netlfix app will be just a good as the one for iPad.  I find Xoom's battery drains very quickly.  I have not measured precisely how long Xoom's battery last. But I need to charge it much more often than the iPad 1.  I use an app killer on Xoom to shut off most of the apps when they are not needed but the battery usage seems to be excessive still.  Did I mention Xoom is heavy?"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I bought the xoom over the galaxy tab 10.1, because of a few reasons. Metal back and $100 cheaper with 32 GB and microSD slot, miniusb, hdmi out. I was surprized to see that there are three separate connections; hdmi, mini usb, and a thin power port. I don't like such power ports, on on my Himd player broke on the adapter side, looks fragile. The tablet feels a bit heavy especially when you put it in a leather folder case. Seems ok with a back silicon case. Some reviewers have complained about fingerprints. Well, if you use fingers then you are going to leave prints, but these can be easily wiped off with a microfiber cloth.\n\nInitially I was kind of disappointed. I have not used it to the level that some other reviewer have described, that is, creating folders and saving files. I have bookmarked pages, and downloaded non market apps, and other things.\n\nAfter using the xoom for a few days, I found the operation to be smooth, all browsing is fast and smooth, no jerky stuff anywhere, of course you will get jerky motion while finding your way around when you just switched on the device. Need to let it load stuff into memory from the storage. I like it and I don't know why a news item two days ago read \"xoom sales falter..\" or something. For four ninety nine for 32GB and a great screen it is excellent.\n\nBy the way my charger out of the box was dead. I had to buy a backup online, and motorola send me one under warranty also.\n\nAlso another thing, in the month that I have used it, I have not used the MicroSD, microUSB, or the HDMI. Not felt the need for any of these as yet. Which makes these extras. Perhaps Samsung is better. Afer considering a number of things. The only adavantage over the galaxy tab 10.1 is the metal back and lower priced for 32 GB.\n\nOne last bit of advice if you are considering the xoom for yourself only then do not give it to any toddlers in the house, you will not get it back. I have to hid it from my kid, I made the mistake of downloading ABC apps, which actually are really good.\n\nHope this helps.\nThank you."}

Beware of Apps downloaded I find a good number of them do not work well with the Honeycomb tablets.  I spent a lot of time looking for a better photo viewer than the default \"Gallery\" and found one called \"Gallery 8\" for Win8 & Honeycomb tablets.  Great quality.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have had the Motorola Xoom for about 2 weeks now.  I held off initially because the 3.0 (Honeycomb) OS just wasn't ready.  So I held off.  I finally dove in with 3.1 and was quickly upgraded to 3.2 and most (if not all) of the biggest issues are now resolved.\n\nMost people want to know what they problems are first, so they can figure out if they really want it.  So I will cover them first.\n\n1.  The Xoom is heavier than most other comparable out now.  If you plan to use this as an e-Reader, this is an issue. (Note you will also find this under the plus section as well)\n\n2.  Price.  It only comes in a 32GB model, so the price (appears) higher than comparable items (that only pack 16 GB of storage).  Though you are getting more for your money, it is a higher entry point, and that makes it a non-starter for some.\n\n3.  Smudges.  Motorola has a habit of putting glass on their products that seem to attract smears and streaks, like no other product on the planet.\n\n4.  Honeycomb.  This is another plus and minus.  I put it here, because many of the \"flaws\" that people find in the Xoom were problems with the 3.0 version of Honeycomb.  The device unfairly gets the blame here.  Now that 3.2 is out, those have gone away, but the perception of problems with the Xoom persist, even though they are gone.\n\n5.  Honeycomb Part 2... There is presently less than stellar number of apps designed for Honeycomb.  It is getting better by the day, and as the market grows, so will the number of apps and games, but for now, if you like to play games on your device, you will find the experience limiting.\n\nOK, so now we got the bad out of the way, lets cover the good.\n\n1.  Sturdy.  Some complain about the weight of the Xoom, but it feels and is SOLID.  It is not flimsy, and you don't feel like it is going to snap in your hands if you put just a bit too much pressure on it.\n\n2.  Productivity.  Since this device (and Honeycomb) is built as a tablet OS and not just a big iPod Touch (like the iPad) it is meant for getting things done.  The Widescreen layout and easy connection of a Bluetooth keyboard, along with apps like Evernote make this a great out of the box productivity tool.\n\n3.  Flash, it runs it and as well as any device.  iOS will NEVER be able to do that.\n\n4.  No corners cut.  It has 32 GB of storage, 1 GB of RAM and an SD Card slot (which now works as of Honeycomb 3.2).  Others cut one of those corners to lower the price... but cheaper is not necessarily good if you are getting less as well.\n\nOverall, while there are pluses and minuses to any tablet, the reputation (which really belongs to the early release of Honeycomb) is the only real \"problem\" with the Xoom.  If you want to get things done... this is the device to get.  If you want an e-reader or something to play games on... then you may wish to look at something else."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I purchased the Motorola Xoom (Wi-Fi) from a nearby big box electronics store, after having been tablet-less for several months. I had the original iPad for nearly a year and sold it when the iPad 2 was announced, with the intent to buy the iPad 2 when it became available. But in the intervening couple of weeks, I found I didn't miss it, so I never bothered. Then, last week, I started getting tablet fever again, but I decided to stick with the Android-based offerings.\n\nNow, I used to be a PC-only kind of guy with nothing but disdain for the hordes of hipster Apple fanboys. Then, a few years ago, I became one. However, for the last year or so, I've found a nice state of equilibrium. My work computer is a MacBook Pro (with a Boot Camp installation of Windows 7 that I use periodically), my HTPC is Windows-based, and while I had three iPhones in a row, I currently have a Droid X that I'm quite happy with. I'm neither pro- nor anti-Apple at this point. But having now used an iPad and an Android-based tablet, I have to say I like the Android OS better. More flexibility and freedom... it just feels more powerful. Granted, iOS is slick and polished and it works exceedingly well, but I like things that take their orders from ME, rather than a bunch of UX designers (even though they're very very smart).\n\nSo, after getting the Xoom and greatly enjoying it for a few days, a friend of mine pointed out that a certain chain office supply store is offering a $100 instant rebate on all tablets until the end of the month. For $100, it was definitely worth the hassle of returning it... but then I started thinking that maybe I'd rather have the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-10-1-Inch-16GB-Wi-Fi/dp/B00519RW1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung Galaxy Tab (10.1-Inch, 16GB, Wi-Fi)</a>. After all, it was still Honeycomb... and that was what I liked best about the Xoom, right? Plus it was sleek, thin and lighter than even the iPad 2. No storage expandability, but I felt that was a compromise I could live with. So I returned the Xoom at the original store and purchased the Galaxy Tab at the other store using the coupon.\n\nI spent that night with the Galaxy Tab, and once the allure of its svelte dimensions wore off (which took all of two minutes), I kept comparing it to the Xoom in my head and found the Galaxy Tab severely lacking. Here's why:\n\nDESIGN\nYeah, the Galaxy Tab is thinner and lighter. It also feels cheap and fragile. The extra heft of the Motorola gives an impression of quality construction and durability, and the materials (the back in particular) simply look higher end than the Samsung. One of the reasons I was drawn to the lighter weight of the Samsung is because I use the tablet to read (via Kindle or Nook app) in bed. I figured it would be easier to hold the lighter device while lying down. As it turns out, even with the Samsung, I'd have to change my grip frequently as my hands/arms became fatigued during lengthy reading sessions. So, while the Galaxy Tab is lighter, it's not SO light that it makes a significant difference in comfort when holding it for long periods. If it were the weight of, say, the Nook Simple Touch, that would be a different story. But it's not even close to being that light.\n\nSOFTWARE\nYou're probably aware that the Xoom has a virtually pristine version of Honeycomb. Motorola doesn't add a bunch of UI customizations or tons of bloatware, which means that software updates are rolled out to it sooner than (likely) any other tablet. For instance, as of this writing, the Xoom is using Android 3.2, while the Galaxy Tab is still on 3.1. Honestly, I don't know what the *specific* differences might be between 3.1 and 3.2, but considering the rate at which Google releases updates to its OS (compared to iOS, for instance), it's important to me that I not have to wait around for months for the manufacturer to release updates. One huge difference I noticed was that the Laps option in the browser settings panel was not available on the Galaxy Tab, which meant the \"Quick Controls\" for the browser were not available. If you don't know what this is, trust me: you want it. After 2 minutes with it, it was one of my favorite features of Honeycomb. If I'd known it wasn't available on the Galaxy Tab, I wouldn't have bothered getting one in the first place.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nI freely admit that I have no empirical evidence to back this up, but the Xoom feels snappier to me than the Galaxy Tab did. With the same widgets on the home screens, sliding between screens on the Xoom feels more fluid and seems to have a better framerate. I will also admit that this MAY be a result of tweaks to Honeycomb 3.2, which the Samsung did not have yet.\n\nCAMERA\nHonestly, I didn't see a huge difference in picture quality from the rear camera, though I believe the Samsung is only 3MP (compared to the Xoom's 5MP rear-facing camera). However, the Xoom does perform better in dark situations with the dual flash, and it seemed to focus a LOT faster than the Samsung.\n\nRECHARGING\nThe Xoom's battery recharges briskly, it seems. The Galaxy Tab, on the other hand, has the longest recharge time of any electronics device I've personally owned in the last few years. I was really surprised.\n\nEXPANDABILITY\nSo, the microSD card slot on the Xoom is now functional. Can easily drag and drop files on the Xoom via the included USB cable. These are things that are lacking on the Galaxy Tab. I didn't think it bothered me, but it does. This is part of what I meant when I said the Galaxy Tab feels like a series of compromises.\n\nNot to mention the fact that, for the exact same price, you get twice the onboard storage (32GB in the Xoom vs 16GB in the Galaxy Tab).\n\nBottom line is that all of the current Android tablets are essentially the same. Same processor, same amount of RAM, same screen resolution, etc. What distinguishes them are things like overall dimensions, expandability and accessories. It seems like the Xoom, though, is the standard against which all other Android tablets are measured. I didn't want to focus on the software experience too much, because that has more to do with Google's Android operating system than with this piece of hardware. That seems like the only fair way to review a tablet. I definitely agonized over the decision, since (sadly for me) this is fairly large chunk of coin to drop on what is essentially a luxury. The Acer Iconia A500 and the Asus Transformer both felt clunky and their bodies audibly creaked and flexed. They felt extremely cheap. Of course, they are the lowest-priced options, so that makes sense. The Toshiba Thrive was amazingly bloated, meanwhile. I guess if you really need a ton of ports, it's a good choice, but that thing is seriously porky. And the Galaxy Tab seems strangely handicapped or, even worse, overpriced for what you get.\n\nAt this point, I definitely think the Motorola Xoom is the top choice for Android tablets. Of course, that can change at the drop of a hat. You know technology."}

I bought it as soon as it came out knowing full well that was a new technology. After a few bumps concerning the removable microSD card, my Xoom is unbelievable!\n\n I use a micro sd chip 1 for professional 1 for personal media, I swap it between my Xoom, my laptop and my desktop, essentially using the Xoom as a work laptop replacement and an entertainment system. Here are two cool things that others haven't mentioned:\n1. I have an app that links the Xoom to the phone system at my office.  If anyone dials my work extension the call will ring through the internet on my Xoom no matter where I am. I make calls while traveling through my work phone number at much lower rates.\n2. I also use an app called Tasker.  When I'm in a meeting the system automatically goes on silent.  Then when the meeting's over my Xoom goes back to default volume level. This is critical for me because I always forget to turn the volume back on my phone after a meeting is over.\n\nIt beats iPad because of the widget function, so the visuals on the 5 home screens perform a function, and because the iTunes restrictions make the running costs of the iPad rather high.\n\nAfter so many copies of the Android tablets have been released, I still think the Xoom is the highest quality piece of equipment.\n\nUpdate (08 July, 2012): Google has updated the Android operating system to 4.0 aka \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" and since then the interface is running incredibly S L O W and the keyboard doesn't work properly.  Many users are complaining of this and trying to go back to the previous OS.  This Motorola Xoom with the current Android OS is a one-star product.  I would return it if I could."}

I remember a day when I wanted an Apple iPad, but those days are now officially over. Every day I use my Xoom, no matter what occasion. You can have a real web browser with full support of Adobe Flash. The Tegra 2 graphics make this into a full fledged portable gaming machine, I have had no hiccups with the games I have downloaded, except the ones not supported on Honeycomb tablets.\n\nThe 10.1 inch HD screen is very good, the 16:9 aspect ratio is PERFECT for watching movies and anything video related.\n\nThat's all, I know the Xoom has an abundance great features than what I mentioned, but I will leave it up to you guys and gals to try this tablets for yourselves."}

I have only had it about 24 hours so I am still learning by the minute.\n\nOne nitpick however - what is with the charging port?  I was expecting a micro USB and was shocked to find its a round jack so now I have another bulky charge plug to carry around... yuck.\n\nThe greatest thing about the Xoom of course is that I can have all the apps I want, and they don't have to be approved by Apple.  Many of the apps I enjoy the most are not available for Apple devices.\n\nI usually explain it to friends this way - if you don't know anything about computers, and don't even particularly like them, go for Apple devices.  They tend to be easier to use and \"dumbed down\" for the average person.  If on the other hand you love technology and getting things to work just right, than you will really enjoy Android devices because ultimately, you can just do so much more.\n\nThe Xoom continues that expectation for me.  It has worked almost flawlessly.  The biggest advantage over Apple devices is the beautiful tabbed chrome browser. (Unfortunately the bookmark sync is broken, hope its fixed soon).\n\nThe Xoom really complements my droid X.  This is one great tablet."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Let me start by saying this: The Motorola Xoom is no Ipad and believe me that is a positive & not a negative. Not because Apple products are not some of the most innovative, best designed, and most user friendly consumer items ever created- because they are. It is simply that Android is a totally different user experience . I bought my Xoom Wifi for $379 after coupons and discounts. The device is able to: effortlessly sync my email especially Gmail. Has Micro SD slot for additional 32 gbs of storage after 3.2 update. Has an excellent GPS with turn by turn navigation. It is a good e-book reader. Able to read & edit documents. I am able to HDMI out to watch movies via Netflix or Google movies. It records HD video & also has a solid 5.0 MP rear camera for taking still photos. Excellent battery life. I was able to drive from Tampa,FL to Atlanta, GA using the the GPS (Bluetooth tethered to my smartphone) and watching a movie along the way and still had 30% battery life when I got home. It may seem like there are not enough apps for Android tablets but there are more than enough for practical, productive & fun activities especially with the tweaks for optimization of smartphone apps in Honeycomb 3.2. All in all an EXCELLENT device at a great value."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Not so long ago, I was a skeptic of any $600+ toy that fills no pre-existing need.  Now, I am a deep and thorough convert.  You should take my cynical entrance into Xoom-ownerdome with as much gravity as the fact that I am a pretty technically savyy person who had done massive research prior to purchase and has continued to evaluate options since.  I've been comparing notes daily on a friends progress with his ipad which he bought almost at the same time.  As I found apps and ways to do things on the Xoom, I've also figured them out for the ipad on his behalf.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Xoom and the ipad can both do everything that we've found necessary and desirable. I have found them equally easy to set up and work with.  Having said that, I am not easily daunted by computers in general.  Still, if I were picking a device for my computer-illetarate grandmother, I would have no more hesitation handing her a Xoom than an ipad.  In fact, certain features of the Xoom would make me choose it.  Desktop widges and the general behavior of the desktop are one.  The ipad has given me a respect of apple products that I had previously lacked.  HOWEVER.  There was one reason and one reason only why I went to buy a tablet at all -- and that was to be able to hand write on the screen with a stylus, while a third party app recognized my writing and turned it into text.  The app in question work very well and exists for both devices.  However, there's a crucial difference.  On the Xoom, this app is allowed to become one of my collection of input devices.  There's the default on-screen Android keyboard which I love.  There's the handwriting pad.  There's a sliding keyboard.  I can use any of them in any application.  So, I can choose my favorite note taking or word processor app, and use any of the keyboards with it.  In ipad, everything is locked down and super-proprietory.  That's Apple's core philosophy.  So, no, you can't give a brilliant third-party app access outside of itself.  This is an example only, and an elaborate one, but you can extrapolate from there.  There are all sorts of options and controls available to me on the Xoom, that are locked down in the competition.  It might not bother some, but it would drive me nuts.  I am a huge proponent of customization.  Computers should conform to our work styles and make us more productive that way. I don't buy the answer that if I want to do something one way and it's not supported, then there's something wrong with what I want and need to learn the \"right\" way of thinking from a devices design limitations.  It's a major and irreversable turn off for me.  With the Xoom, there are many abilities than are missing elsewhere and would be barriers to my progress had I gone with a different device.\n\nOn the physical aspects, it is a little heavier.  I wish that were not so, but I care more what's on the inside.  I can do almost everything on the Xoom that I can do in a full laptop, and this baby is a lot smaller and is always on.\n\nThe screen is beautiful, large, widescreen, great resolution. I constantly watch streaming movies on it and I love it.\n\nThe speakers are very good.  Seeing as I AM using it for movies so much, though, I'll be buying the speaker dock.\n\nThe device is very solid and I have confidence in it.\n\nThe camera is of phenominal quality - and of course there are two of them - front and back.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with my choice and I find new reasons why I was right to choose this every day."}

I was able to connect with a lot of help and some user apps.  I would encourage\nGoogle to put more focus on enterprise connectivity. I may upgrade my rating still more in the future depending on my experiences.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems to be more a toy, although an elegant and very interesting one.\n\nI work in a large corporation, which uses the LEAP protocol for WiFi security. The corporate user name contains the window domain.\n\nAmazingly, in the time that Android, and now Honeycomb, has been out, it never was configured to handle a windows domain attached to a user name, when using the LEAP protocol.  Actually, the native WiFi settings cannot recognize LEAP, but third parties have been able to create apps which can authenticate within LEAP...except if a windows domain name is involved.  In that case, according to a developer's notes, the Honeycomb is simply not constructed to be able to handle domain names.\n\nThis cuts the Xoom out from accessing the WiFi, mail, etc, from many large corporate sites.  Incidentally, all the Android phones have the same problem: they cannot connect to a WiFi protected by the LEAP protocol if a windows domain name is necessary.\n\nI can access the WiFi, and all the apps from the Google and other markets, from home. At the price I got the Xoom, I have no plans to return it.  However, it is mind-boggling to me that the Google developers of Honeycomb would not give their operating system the extra attention to permit it to access the many corporate systems with LEAP.  Needless to say, the apple iOS has no problem, either with the iPhone or iPad, in handling the LEAP protocol.\n\nI don't need a tablet for my working environment at this time, so fortunately, this egregious omission won't really hurt me.  Probably, in the next year or so, my work requirements will make owning a fully Enterprise tablet desirable, and if a viable Android/Honeycomb version has not appeared, my next tablet will likely be Apple or a Windows system."}

My whole family uses it for quick browsing on the Internet - Flash videos work great.

I chatted with my buddy in LA while in the Hard Rock Cafe in Biloxi, MS. We were able to broker a deal for some pins with a waitress right in the restaurant. I felt like Dick Tracy or something!

I love the user interface, in fact I much prefer it to the iPad user experience.\n\nIt's heavy, which can be hard on my poor RSI-ravaged wrists when using it as an e-reader at night, but I like that it doesn't feel cheap, flimsy, and fragile.\n\nThe battery life is excellent, especially compared to my android phone experiences.\n\nMy one criticism is that it doesn't charge through the microUSB port.  That was a serious oversight on the design front.  I travel a lot and I don't need to be carrying around yet another damn charger.  All my other devices are chargeable via USB, this one should as well.  I mean, really, the USB port is already THERE.\n\nLooking forward to the SD slot getting functional, but even still, the 32GB of memory holds HEAPS.\n\nThe two video/still cameras shoot great quality, both sound and video.  I was really impressed.  I mean, don't expect SLR quality, but it's a lot better than your average camera phone set-up.\n\nKind of annoying that connecting to a Mac required separate software, but that said, the software was free, quick and easy to acquire, and had a nice Mac-like look-and-feel.\n\nThe one design element I think they got wrong was putting the power button on the back instead of along an edge. After 2 months of using it, it is still awkward to reach.\n\nIn a nutshell, if you want a tablet in your life, and want to run Android, this won't disappoint you."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I've had my Xoom for about 2 weeks and have held off on my review until I became more familiar with it's features. The Xoom is feature rich, I was able to transfer my ITunes library into my music folder without any fuss. My written data and photos also were moved over without problems. I love the size and functionality and continue to learn new tricks almost daily, like I said in the title, it is a learning experience going from the PC world to the Honeycomb OS but I'm adapting pretty we'll. I'm praying that an ITunes app will appear on the horizon someday and an easy way to print to a networked printer. I travel quite a bit and this fits the bill for size and surfing the web when out and about, if not for lack of an ITunes app and easier printing ability I would've given it 5 stars. Overall, I'm very happy with my Xoom and find myself using it almost exclusively now instead of the PC."}

We needed both to demonstrate the capabilities, and I always use the iPad for personal use. The xoom just sits in my drawer except when needed for display.\n\nThe iPad is thinner, lighter, and I love the Apple apps. I always hated Apple, their proprietary and want to kill flash. But flash actually should die, the files are huge and eat up battery life on everything. After a few days with the iPad, I was sold.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "We have an iPad, an iPad2, and the Xoom. They are 3 different experiences, but the iPads are mostly about thinner, lighter, and maybe faster (iPad2 only). The Xoom does not FEEL slower, but it is definitely heavier than the iPad2. That said, who sits and hold a tablet in their hands for more than a minute? Some have criticized the screen for color washout. I went to the same browswer page on all 3 of our tablets and discovered that the iPads are over-boosted for color. So skin tone, for instance, is more accurate on the Xoom. In addition, the Xoom has a light sensor that dims the screen in a dark room so the glare is reduced. Nice feature...maybe that's why some thought the screen was washed out. Compared to the iPads, the Xoom is more complicated. If you're familiar with Android, you probably won't have much of a problem, but otherwise, you'll experience a lot of frustration--I use a tons of tech, and I did--without a manual. Luckily, a manual is easy to find and cheap or free. I got mine from the Kindle store. The Xoom experience is really more for people who like tech and like to control their device's environment, in my opinion, while the iPad is more about \"turn it on and go.\" If you're heavily into streaming movies or vids from Amazon or a competitor, go with the Xoom because the use of the screen's space is superior. The tablet war will be won with apps, eventually, and Android and others are lagging because developers can't make their return on investment yet, but give it a half year or so and Andriod's Honeycomb will be competitive, though still behind Apple, I believe. My final comment is that I would always want an iPad AND a Honeycomb tablet. There might be a better version than the Xoom here or coming, but really check the feature set, and make sure it's a fair comparison: are you getting the same memory and 4G connectivity for the price, for instance? Do both have usb, hdmi, mini SD card slot, etc? In the end, I really like the Xoom, despite having to work at it...but I'll also be buying an iPad 3 when it comes out.\n\nPros:\n4G coming, Great feature set (far superior to the iPad), Versatility, Quick, Solid build quality, True multi-tasking, More user control\nCons:\nCan be over-priced (so shop), A few features still not available, Needs a manual, Heavy, Plenty of Apps, but needs to double down.\nBest Uses:\nBrowsing, Games, Music, Email, Photos, Research, Productivity (beats Apple here), Reading, Etc."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I had the Wifi-only Xoom for about four weeks, but it wasn't cutting it. Where i live, at least, there just aren't enough hot spots to make it feasible for me to carry a Wifi tablet everywhere I go and be able to access content frequently enough to be satisfying.  So, i decided to trade that one back in for a Xoom with a 3/4G radio. I went to my local mall to get the replacement. I stopped by the Apple Store while I was there and I ended up playing around with an iPad 2 and eventually buying one instead of a Xoom.\n\nApple is just too far ahead of everybody else right now to consider anything other than an iPad. I'm waiting to see if the coolness wears off, but I've been using it for a couple weeks so far and there's a world of difference for me. The iPad has so many apps available (I knew this before I bought the Xoom, but sold myself on the thought that the Android market would catch up quickly enough. I guess that hard core NIX programmers might disagree with me, but I think that the average consumer will find my experience on this to be a good measure - the number of available apps really do matter in the long run!\n\nAnother biggie, for me, was the ability to use Flash - this was a big factor in my decision to go with the Xoom in the first place and the sites with Flash worked swimmingly on it. However, since I've made the switch to the iPad I must honestly say that, IMHO, the Flash functionality is over-hyped. I haven't noticed (very much) the inability to view Flash on the iPad, definitely not to the extent I expected. Every once in a while I get a \"blank\" box on a web site, but most of them seem to be advertisements in the first place and that's just not hurting my feelings!\n\nI keep thinking of new things... Weight - there's a significant difference in comfort and usability here too. My wife tried the Xoom once, but it was too heavy and uncomfortable to entice her to try it again (I should probably mention that she is a smart phone junkie! She does everything on her phone, much more than I ever did). She spends a lot of time using the iPad now and claims that the main reason is that it's comfortable to do so. This might actually be a reason NOT to get the Apple -everybody else wants to use it for you!\n\nSpeakers - I really liked the sound that the Xoom put out. Stereo speakers were awesome. I did find myself having to cup my hands around them when listening to something that also required me to watch the screen, in order to \"direct\" the sound from those beautiful stereo speakers (still think the designers should work on speaker placement in the next version) and it does become uncomfortable after a while. But they sound wonderful. The speaker on the iPad doesn't match, but it's okay, I have to use headphones together the same high-quality sound from the iPad.\n\nPower button - I agree with the antagonists on this one. The power. Button placement on the Xoom is horrible! I had a case that required me to remove the tablet almost half way from its enclosure just to press the button. You wouldn't expect it to be a major issue, but it was.\n\nFinal indicator - I'm an IT type and I use computers extensively. I usually leave my home PC running (in power saving mode, of course) and my work laptop is on whenever I'm home. This pattern didn't change with the Xoom, but since i brought the iPad home they have both been powered down. I'm finding that the tablet serves for the vast majority of my casual usage - the whole thing is really making me rethink how I compute.\n\nBottom line, for me, the iPad is by far the better choice for a typical user that is looking for a convenient device. Hopefully the Android community will catch up (did I mention that I'm NOT an Apple fan?), but there's just no comparison right now."}

The hardware is mostly fine, but the software is missing many things from google's side, from Motorola's side, and from the various application vendors out there.\n\n1) No skype video, only audio. With all the right hardware in place this is just plain sad.\n\n2) No slacker radio app (there is pandora though), and you can't even use the browser with flash installed to access their site (even if you tell the browser to report itself as a desktop using about:debug).\n\n3) No Netflix at all. Lame.\n\n4) No desktop-like internet, you still feel like you're stuck in a mobile phone. The browsers have very few security/privacy controls. Access to bookmarks, tabs, and forward and back navigation are all very clumsy and inconvenient. You close the browser and think it's closed, but no, it's still running in the background draining battery power.\n\n5) No good Powerpoint viewer/editor (even the pay versions) -- no movies displayed, HDMI out looks fuzzy, display bugs when showing things made with MS Powerpoint (missing text, misplaced objects, etc.). Forget about replacing your laptop for presentations, which would have been really nice and would have made the whole expense worth it for me if I never had to cart a laptop around.\n\n6) No SD card support, even though we were told this would be enabled via software update, Motorola never provided one. This is basically false advertising since it has been so many months now.\n\n7) No built in firewall controls (you either allow all required control to an app or you don't install the app). You're only option is to root the device and download some 3rd party app.\n\n8) Few high-quality apps, tons of low quality apps in the market (not much different than ipad, but still an issue when comparing to laptops/netbooks).\n\n9) Proprietary charger! Seriously? It has a micro USB port that it can't use to charge. It needs a 12V wall wart. It reminds me of the cell phones a few years back. Dumb.\n\n10) No decent alarm clock app: the built-in app is lame and the ones for download are to buggy and unreliable.\n\n11) No direct access to the OS. I have never owned a system where I wasn't the administrator (root). This is a Linux device without terminal access and \"rooting\" it voids the warranty. No enabled command line for you (you can do \"ls\" and \"cd\", but that's it). Super lame.\n\nOverall, the state of the tablet in general is very poor right now. Websites either show very little info, or if you tell it to use the desktop version it is very difficult to click on anything since the text is so small. I bought this because I hated the internet on my Blackberry, but now I find it is hardly any better, just a bigger screen and faster since it's wifi. Even though I am using Wifi, the web is very slow compared to a laptop or desktop, in both the built-in browser (chrome) and firefox. I have no idea why they advertise this product as having such a fast processor when it feels so slow.\n\nInternet is poor, presentations are poor, multimedia is poor, GPS navigation is awkward at best, and I cannot recommend this for anything other than an e-book reader or PDF reader at this point. Along those lines, I should have got a kindle and saved a bunch of money."}

My experience with the web browser has been frustrating. Sometimes the browser takes forever to load a page. This happens frequently. Also, the browser spontaneously closes. This also happens frequently.\n\nThe latest versions of the browser and system software have been installed with little improvement. The browser cache has been cleared on a regular basis and the unit has been power cycled numerous times.\n\nIn all, I really like this tablet but, in my opinion, this device is not quite ready for prime time. If I could do it over,  I would wait for improvements to be made before purchasing it.  The browser issues interfere too much and significantly detract from the pleasure of using this device.\n\nDefinitely could not recommend this to a friend.

One of the reasons I purchased this is to use with the many regulations I refer to while performing an audit. This allows me to work on my laptop, refer to regulations on the Xoom, and not have to lug around numerous, heavy paper copies of regulations. Even the vertical orientation is large enough to be able to read full pages of most regulations including the Federal Register. If that is not large enough, simply switching to horizontal orientation enlarges to the width of a normal 8 1/2 inch wide page.\n\nIt's important to find the right applications to perform what you want to do, but there are many out there to choose from. I also purchased the Motorola supplied portfolio case, which is ok, but I'm not thrilled with it. I'm still looking for a bit more friendly case for handling the device.\n\nIn addition, the Xoom provides the abililty (with WiFi) to check personal emails, use GPS-related software, and listen to some tunes on those long flights.\n\nIt's my newest best travel gadget for work."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I bought the Xoom the day it came out- and was initially very disappointed- primarily because Honeycomb has so many loose ends and holes. Through the months, as several updates were released, my experience with the Xoom only got better. Today, it's fast, responsive, and the 3D UI looks amazing. Comparing it to the iPad2, which essentially runs the same iOS as the iPhone, the Honeycomb OS really is truly a new-age OS for tablets. The Games and Apps designed for Honeycomb and Tegra 2 devices are smooth and look beautiful- its just a matter of time before more apps are optimized for tablets.\nThe SD card will be unlocked very soon with Honeycomb 3.2 coming out- so like I said, the Xoom just keeps getting better."}

Though we wanted to purchase the Xoom as soon as it came out, the initial price kept us away. So far we've both really enjoyed the tablet. I would recommend it to anyone considering a Honeycomb tablet. I feel the build quality is a little better than the less expensive Honeycomb options out there right now. The screen is beautiful and display very clear photos and video. The processor is very snappy; I have not really had to wait for anything to load other than the initial startup. I've been especially amazed by the battery life. Though we generally only use the Xoom in the evenings, it is always powered on. We have found the battery will last 3-5 days based on our modest daily use. My only two complaints are both things I can live with. The weight of this tablet is definitely greater than the competition, but sometimes I enjoy the extra heft. I also wish Netflix or Motorola or Google would work out the kinks preventing a usable Netflix app from working on Honeycomb tablets. Tablets are supposed to be multimedia powerhouses and when you're missing one of the most popular media sources out there, you have a problem. The same goes for Hulu. I hope they will work out the issues and complete the epicness that is the Motorola Xoom tablet."}

The XOOM 3G/Wi-fi tablet owners still have to wait on the update for 3.2, but at least the FCC has approved Motorola's 4G radio now. So the 4G upgrade will be coming soon.\n\nOk. I just purchased this XOOM tablet on 6/14/2011. I never had any issues with WI-FI connections or 3G connectivity. My wife loves it and so do I. All the 1 or 2 star haters. Either they have bad luck with theirs or not savvy enough on electronics. After I activated my tablet and created a new Google sign in account. I was able to use the 3G connectivity on the go. But because the downside to this tablet and any other tablets on the market, the data usage isn't UNLIMITED. You must pay a tiered pricing if your not able to get a WI-FI signal. I chose the 3GB plan for $35 bucks. I just use my WI-FI signal at home (or where its free) to save on my usage. The tablet updated itself two times on me. One was the upgrade to Honeycomb 3.1 from 3.0 and the other I have no idea. It comes with pre-loaded music from Outkast to various artists. Few apps to play with and few wallpapers to choose from. Taken pictures from the rear camera came out really superb, and front facing camera was pretty decent. Since the micro SD Card is not activated yet on the XOOM, you have an 32 GB internal storage. I'm still getting the hang of this huge powerful 10.1\" tablet. So maybe in a month or two I will update my review. Hopefully then some features might get upgraded. There are some downside to this tablet. And some people must understand that the Honeycomb OS is new and software developers need time to update their apps on the market to be compatibility, due to the large size screens on these tablets. I tried downloading some apps that I normally use on the Droid X, and the XOOM tablet would either not able to run it or lot of force closes. Yes there are some bugs here and there.

It's immediately noticable that it's heavier than we expected. The screen glare is significant with light as in a car or near a window. This leads to very noticable fingerprinting. The color and brightness are great. Applications available now are very responsive. It's obvious that there will be more and better marketplace application availble later. I read my news while i have my coffee away from my desk, It's very nice for that. Google news and USA Today are great sources. Battery life is the amazing 10 hours and the charging is surprisingly fast."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Reviewing the Xoom is basically reviewing three things; The Device, the Android 3.1 Honeycomb operating system, and the available Apps.  I got mine very early on, and I use it every day, so I have plenty of familiarity.\n\nAs for the device, its outstanding.  The touch screen responsiveness (in tandem with the resolution of the screen) is wonderful.  The Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi, and sound are all great.  The gyroscope and cameras are fair, but I don't honestly care about those.  The speed is very smooth and impressive.  You don't really need the awesome processor, but hey, why not.  The RAM is not much, but I have never noticed issues since Android is so extremely light.  I also like the aspect ratio of the screen, which is more of a pleasing, long rectangle than the iPad.  The main negative is that it feels a bit heavy, but it also feels very rugged, and the battery lasts a long time.\n\nThe operating system is great.  It is basically just Android with a UI supped up for the big screen.  The main thing is the Browser.  It's gotten a lot better since 2.x.  Since the latest update, its outstanding.  I honestly feel as comfortable with it as a desktop.  I have tried some 3rd party browsers like Firefox for Android, but the native Android one is so terrific.  As for the rest, I like the multiple desktops and how the icons are managed, the very well organized and complete device settings interface, and some of the little included apps like Gmail.  There is no real bloat ware, just a few free games.\n\nBut, contrary to what I have heard, there are plenty of great apps that, when added to Android, make this like a real operating system.  File explorers like ASTRO, Text editors like Ted, FTP Clients like AndFTP, Security apps for password protection like Perfect AppLock.  I have a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, and to me this thing is basically a tablet that can transform into a nice netbook.  I am also very happy with the support.\n\nI would say if you want an Android tab over an iPad, this one is a good choice, especially since they dropped the price.  I would also not be scared of getting any Android tablet instead of an iPad, they are awesome."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I'm not going to say much in the way of Android vs Apple, except the reason Ipad's need so many more apps is because half of all websites don't function properly without flash support.  With honeycomb, you don't need an app for most things, because you can go directly to most websites you want (except for MS silverlight based sites).  Overall, the xoom to me is almost perfect, you can do mostly everything except for printing, but I think that functionality is on its way.  I haven't touched my laptop since I bought the xoom, and don't really fell I need to for much.  It is pretty light and mostly comfortable to carry, and the only knock I have so far is lack of SD card support and games are slowly arriving everyday.  Sometimes I have to shut down and reboot, just because I was doing too much, but that happens with just about everything these days.\n\nI would recommend an android tablet to just about anyone, and especially since honeycomb is in its early stages, and is just going to get better."}

It is far better than its competitors, including the iPad.

But these are minor details only perceived by perfectionists. Its architecture more open than the competition is a big difference."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Well, I have had this a few days and here is the lay of the land. I have been very pleased with it overall. It has that same well built feel the droid phones have. I haven't checked the listed weights, but it feels like it weights the same as the Ipad. It has more of a book/widescreen feel than the Ipad however. The Ipad is closer to a square than the xoom. One coworker who has an original Ipad says he prefers the way the xoom feels in his hand. Not quite as bulky, for lack of a better word.\n\nThe screen is also very nice. Excellent display and the look reminds me a lot of the beautiful samsung TVs. Moving around is also very fast. The apple Ipad coworker commented, \"wow, it is very responsive.\" One slight con I have noticed is with typing. Oddly enough it lags behind me a tad. With that said, I am an IT professional who has been on computers for close to 30 years. I am the fastest pecker this side of the mississippi......errrrr wait. The \"keyboard\" lag won't bother most people.\n\nThe camera also seems very nice compared to my droid. The droid camera takes too long to focus and shoot. The xoom is much faster. We were getting some great easter shots and video very fast switching back and forth between front camera, back camera and video camera. I then pressed a button and presto they were on our Picasa site so all of our family could see. The wireless also has very good range. I got the wifi version and always get a chuckle when I pull in my driveway and hear the email notification start dinging. One last comment is the battery life.  I have found it to be very good as well."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "This thing is awesome.  I purchased this to compliment my HTC EVO and my MacBook Pro 13\".\n\nI am a non-traditional student and this device was purchased to bridge the gap between the many times I don't feel like lugging my MacBook Pro (which isn't heavy, but I have a bag for it which is heavy), but having a 4.3\" screen like my EVO isn't enough.  It's for that 15-25 minutes you are burning between meetings, classes, or before a class.  It's for sitting on the couch and vegging out and not having to deal with a MacBook's lid.\n\nThe downside for this is the weight.  It is lighter than an iPad 1, so it isn't dork heavy, it's just heavy enough to be uncomfortable.  Having the proper protective case for it helps give you the confidence to hold it in ways so as not to worry about scratching it or whatever.  In fact, I don't even think I would like to have it if they didn't make a great case for it; and I carry my EVO in it's full glory of nakedness.  Another downside is the smearing, but I don't know how you'd fix that.\n\nThe strengths of the Honeycomb 3.1 OS are fantastic.  It's buttery smooth, just like the iPad.  While there aren't 100,000 Android tablet specific apps out there yet, like the iPad, I would say there's enough to keep you busy and happy, and a lot of the apps already in the app store(s) are sufficiently supported by Honeycomb and they look just fine.\n\nI do suggest getting your hands on a 3rd party keyboard.  I have SwiftKey and I also have Thumb Keyboard and I totally suggest the Thumb Keyboard.  The marketing isn't as sexy, but the TK is THE keyboard and no I have no affiliation with them.\n\nGood luck and enjoy the tablet.  I love it!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "There are other good reviews around, and I would recommend provided you know your way around and you are happy changing the interface and tweaking things around.\nIt's great and fun, works fine and app market is catching up with apple and will have to wait and see what will happen.\nGreat look and feel but lack cool accessories, as a bag and other stuff.\nIf you are looking for something that you do not need to think too much go for an ipda/iphone.\n\nWhat I would wish to known before I bought it: tethering/connecting the xoom to my mobile phone (blackberry, nokia, htc and iphone) is not easy and there are many hurdles...It does not work with bluetooth dun and ad-hoc wifi. So provided this is something important look around for what's going to be your combination of phone/tablet and also if you should not go for the 3G version.\n\nVideo conference does not work that well with qik, and you can go for Tango, but you will hit a couple of force closes and find many apps that are made for phone but not for a tablet and they might eventually crash.\n\nThe charger that has a differen prong makes now again necessary to carry yet another charger - there are good technical reasons, but I loved so much travelling around with one charger and the usb adapters... No longer possible.\n\nTo become perfect they would need to make it a bit thinner, lighter and push google to improve faster the updates for honeycomb...

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I'm sure most of us who purchased the Xoom were waiting for something better than the iPad before jumping into the tablet scene or, at least, I know I was.  I was waiting for news on the iPad 2 to see the new features it would have.  Once I heard the news about a WiFi only Honeycomb device, I became intrigued and began to follow rumors and news I could find on both devices.  Eventually, I listed my pros and cons before making my purchase.  My needs were:\n\nI wanted to:\n\nbrowse the internet without having to use a touchpad or a mouse.\nplay all of my favorite emulators (these apps have since been shut down on the Market place)\ntether to my cell phone's data network and, since I don't have AT&T or Verizon, it made sense to go with Android, imo.\nuse bluetooth with gaming controllers to play games wireless without touching the screen.\nplayback HD movies that I moved from my computer to the tablet.\nbrowse the entire screen through HDMI-out onto my big screen TV without any limitations in place by the developer IE: all apps view on TV.\naccess to the file system via USB on my computer and in-device.\nbe able to download, install, browse, etc everything in my system (for the most part) within the device without relying on a computer to do so.\nflash capability even though some flash sites drain everything from resources to battery life.\nbe able to read eBooks through Kindle or Google Reader apps.\nbe able to import or purchase comic books and read them through a comic book reader.\nbe able to upgrade the memory in the tablet.\n\nSo, after researching and reviewing tech specs, opinions, and the like all over the web and through family and friends, I came to the conclusion that the Motorola Xoom met all of these needs for me.\n\nLike a previous reviewer said, there is a learning curve to the device and within the first week, I was hardly impressed.  I kept tinkering with it and and learning the device to the point of becoming reliant on it for simple web browsing, reading, and gaming.  I'm a desktop PC kind of person over a laptop so this device made perfect sense for me and gives me a break from sitting at a desk and can accomplish these things at my leisure and then go back to my daily routines elsewhere.  The battery life is pretty decent for me.  Typically lasts about 5 - 6 hours of constant use ie: moving apps.  Strictly using the reader apps, it will last longer, obviously.  The one thing that blew me way was how good the cameras were.  The front facing camera has a lower megapixel lens so the quality there is a little less but it's perfectly fine for a webcam and the picture taker on the back of the device takes decent quality large pictures.  I did not expect these to be on a device like this yet.  I'm glad Motorola invested in them.\n\nThere are a few negatives for this device.  Firstly, Honeycomb is not a mature platform yet and there are a ton of apps not yet optimized for the tablet.  Obviously, this will be fixed as it gains in popularity, and the ones that are optimized are very nice.  There are creative apps that you can make use of day 1.  However, it's obvious that Google jumped right into Honeycomb and the developers are still playing catch up.  Over time, more and more apps will become optimized and make use of the entire screen but, as of now, there are quit a few apps that run in cell phone mode ie: small blocks on the screen or the apps take up a corner of the screen and the layout repeats throughout the rest of the screen.  Not a deal breaker but expect these types of situations if you purchase this device.\n\nThe other negative I have is that the screen sometimes becomes unresponsive.  Occasionally, the apps stop working and the screen just does not respond to my fingers.  A simple tap of the standby button to turn off the screen and another tap of the same button to bring the screen back on always cures this dilemma but it's strange that this little quirk happens.  It does not take away from the experience whatsoever although when showing off the device to friends and explaining that quirk makes the device seem disappointing when you're trying to get the word out."}

Having a closely controlled environment has never been satisfying for me.  Enter the Xoom...I bought an iPad 2 for my wife and was considering getting one for myself but now I'm very glad I didn't.  Only the Xoom allows me to make the tablet \"mine\".  Don't get me wrong...the iPad is a nice consumer tablet for the masses...but the Xoom is a power-user's tablet.  It can do anything the competition can and then some...with flash support and it's open source heritige.  While Honeycomb-optimized apps are lacking today given the explosive growth of Android this is surely going to change rapidly.  I've been very happy with my Xoom as I move into hour 25 of ownership.

First, the manufacturer is Motorola, a company which I'm a big fan of...great products, great customer service...I go back to the RZR days with them..and even the original BRICK phone from the 80's...When you hold the ANDROID Powered XOOM it feels light but solid build.  I was blown away by the Beautiful 10.1 inch TRUE HD 1080 display..other tablets including the IPAD 2 have less than 1080 HD...they call it HD but its not 1080..the maximum you can get...the other thing was the screen layout..its aspect ratio is like what you have on your HD tv at home...not a square box like the old tube tv's...(this is what the IPAD 2 has)..so you get the complete HIDEF movie screen...the other thing was the multiple home screens the XOOM has...5 total...while the IPAD 2 has 3....plus the XOOM has sizable widgets...which are like \"live shots\" of your apps...I have my calendar,email and browser bookmarks...so I can instanly see my email, calendar and bookmarks and even scroll thru them right on my screen without having to go into the app.  Also, the music layout simply blows away the Ipad 2 and others with a beautiful diagonal flowing cover art display..and here are the deal makers..The XOOM has 32 gigs internal memory plus an SD slot to expand...IPAD 2 does not...XOOM has dual led 5 megapixel camera IPAD 2 has 2 megapixel with NO FLASH! XOOM has a 2 megapixel front facing camera for web conferancing IPAD 2 has a VGA camera!! thats less than 1 megapixel!  PLus the XOOM has an HDMI and USB port..IPAD 2 does not..Overall, I think the DROID XOOM offers the better experience...I found the IPAD 2 to be very stale...it's technology felt antiquated..pretty much a glorified e-reader..3 home screens, a music/video player..and very compartmentalized multi tasking..not true MT..If you want a tablet experience that seems closer to that of a full blown computer, the DROID XOOM, with Internet FLASH capabilities, dual core chip, widgets, live wallpaper, peripheral compatibility and memory expandability, is the CLEAR CHOICE...BTW, I just received my HONEYCOMB software update and it is AWESOME!!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Friends with iPads have compared their tablets to my Xoom and generally agree that Xoom performance is much faster, some features better.  I personally feel that control of the Motorola / Google Xoom tablet is much more convenient than the current Apple product.  Clearly a good deal of research and effort went into the 'usability' of the Xoom design.\n\nOften argued is Apple's head start building a large app selection.  Afraid I would need to wait awhile for good apps to appear, I was happy to learn that there is already an large selection (check out Android app markets on the web or look through those available from Amazon) of excellent apps.  If you're a gamer, those released by NVIDIA are simply awesome.\n\nWith the power of the Tegra 2 processor in the Xoom and the quantity of tablets that are releasing on the Android tablet operating platform, the quantity of Android apps is likely to increase at a faster pace than was the case with the iPad.\n\nFor a few bucks more, the Xoom significantly beats out the current 'wunder' iPad in my opinion!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I've had my Xoom for a couple of weeks now.  I read all the reviews and discovered that people either loved it or hated it.  Personally, I LOVE it.  I already had an Android based phone (Samsung Fascinate), so the transition to the tablet was pretty easy for me.  I think that alot of the negative reviews are from 'converts' (Apple users switching to Android).\n\nI think that it is important to note that the Android OS has a bit of a different user experience than the iPad. The iPad presents page after page of apps that you scroll through and open.  The Android has more of a 'desktop' type interface that you can customize to your hearts content move stuff where you want it, change your wallpaper, and then these cool little things called 'widgets'.  Widgets make the tablet form factor actually USEFUL.  I can add tweetdeck, weather, calendar and email widgets to one of the pages of the Xoom and they update in real-time.  I know the iPad has animated icons, that show how many new emails you have and even what the current temperature is, but Android takes that further - I can actually SEE the last few emails I have received, I can see the current temperature, as well as sunny/cloudy/stormy - for the next 5 days - the last 5 updates from my Facebook and Twitter feeds, CNBC Markets in real-time and my upcoming tasks on my calendar.  AND, I can do all of this without even opening an app.  That's the power of Android and Widgets.\n\nNow, if you are 'converting' from Apple (iPhone, iPod, or iPad), I would say to be prepared to sit down for a while and learn this OS.  It is SO much more powerful than what Apple lets you do with their OS.\n\nThe single biggest complaint about the Xoom and Android tablets in general - is the lack of apps for the platform.  My experience thus far?  I have absolutely everything I personally want on my Xoom already.  I don't however, use it for watching movies - so the lack of NetFlix (as of the date of this post) isn't a deal-killer for me.  The support of Flash is much more important to me than is NetFlix (which will have an app out soon anyway, I understand).  That's the other thing - I have been going to the Android market every couple of days and there are ALWAYS new apps that are being released that support Android 3.1 (latest release).  Angry Birds is already supported (and downloaded), so who really needs much more than that?  ((grin))\n\nI purchased the Wi-Fi version of the Xoom as I use it mostly at home and at work where I have wi-fi readily available.  I also have a hot spot feature on my phone that I can enable when I'm out of range of free wi-fi - that allows me to get updates on my Xoom anywhere there is a 3G/4G connection for my phone.\n\nOverall, if you like to (or would like to) have control over your tablet and customize it for the way you work or play, Android is the way to go.  The Xoom is a fantastic example, as it is well-built, has a 5MP camera on the back and a 2MP up front for conferencing, and has a TON of fun stuff to download and install already (I have only paid for 3 apps so far - many, many free apps available for the Xoom) with more being introduced virtually everyday, then you should at the very least consider this tablet.  You won't be disappointed.\n\nI highly recommend the Xoom for purchase consideration."}

Another thing that sold this Tablet was the 10\" display.  She loves to read ebooks  and the xoom screen makes it so much easier for her."}

Of course there are not nearly as many apps as the competition, but the great thing about xoom is that most of the non-tablet apps also scale fine without problems.  So in essence, if you were using an app that was made for android phone, you can stil use it on xoom with very few exceptions (some force close and won't run).  All of the popular apps run great.  Of course the apps for tablets are being made everyday and the number of tablet specific apps is increasing rapidly.\n\nOverall I am very happy with my purchase.  In my opinion flash is still useful to have.  Finally multitasking is great.  I have used ipad (original) and this beats it hands down.\n\nWould highly recommend.  To me the learning curve for using this device is no different than what I went through when I first use the original ipad."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "OK so I bought the xoom despite the not so great reviews, I had gone to the Verizon store to compare the I pad 2 and xoom. The qualitity of the camera cinched it for me. I pad 2 had no flash and blurry, xoom was nice and clear.  The xoom is fast, granted not as smooth as the I pad 2, but it's not that noticable. It took time to learn my way navigating around.  You can download tutorial videos from their site.  I got the force closes on some apps at the beginning but I seem to get updates every other day, and no more forced closes. I'm now updated to flash 10.3.  Pandora app still doesn't work despite last update, but can't be that upset since app was free and I have since uninstalled till maybe the next update will fix whatever is the problem.  I admit I've not paid for a single app I've downloaded because I wasn't so invested in the xoom and debated whether to return but now I'm glad I didn't.  I really use my xoom to read books, sync my email so easily that I've neglected my poor home computer for a while now, play some games and surf the internet.  I 've been happy and no problems now with any of these tasks.\n\nNow down to why just 3 stars. The power adapter stinks. I've had my xoom for over 3 weeks now and the power adapter gave out my charge does not work. I don't know if any other xoom owners have this problem but this is a fatal flaw in my opinion. I can deal with software issues but not hardware. The power adapter shouldn't burn out this quickly, not at the price for the xoom. I first went to Motorola live tech and was in the middle of their problem solving and got cut off, so I called. I just couldn't stand that they read through a script, asking the same questions over and over, and in the end had to put me on hold for a while to find a solution. I had told the agent in the beginning of our session that my power adapter died and I needed a new one and thought it ridiculous that the adapter in the short time I had the xoom. I told her they needed to send me a new replacement because I wasn't going to pay for a new one, if so I was returning the xoom. She still went through her script. In the end she gave me a one time courtesy replacement power adapter, which should get here within 6-7 business days. Agent was very courteous but difficult to sometimes understand with thick accent. Well we'll see what happens. I asked the agent what will happen if the next one dies out and she told me I'd probably have to send in my xoom, which I'd never do, that's why I bought the wifi version instead of 3g, though 3g version now same price as wifi version at Verizon.  I didn't want to send out my xoom.\n\nAgent stated they were aware of the problem but no news if Motorola plans to fix this problem. Sometimes I feel Motorola is not too invested in their Xoom either. They're too busy putting out their next problem, oh I mean product. Is Motorola the next GM. GM almost went out of business too from too many sub par products and a bad business model. But thanks to a bail out from the gov't they're back, I don't think Motorola falls into the same category that they'd get gov't assistance for bad business decisions.\n\nSent from my Motorola xoom.\n\nUpdate 09/07/2011\n\nI will never buy another motorola product again. Bought xoom at the end of April 2011 and already by Sept 2011 the xoom has to be sent to motorola because xoom freezes at boot and will not do a hard factory reset. It sits at starting at fastboot protocol support. Support at motorola couldn't get it to reset, so now I have to send to them, may be a hardware issue. I've updated my 4 stars to a one because really at the price I paid, and not this lower price currently going, this should not be so hard to fix. I've been reading on android forums that this is not an isolated problem, others have had same problem. This is now the 2nd problem I've encountered with the xoom. I just bought the Apple Ipad and even though I love the way honeycomb works and not so crazy about the Ipad, at least you don't have people sending their Ipads back to the company. Customer service support was very nice, but it doesn't wipe out the fact that I still have to send the product back. To avoid this sending anything back to the company is why I bought the xoom wifi. I was starting to depend more on my xoom tablet and I should have known better. Very frustrating, since couldn't back up my products because sd card doesn't work well and pc transfer is frustrating because may freeze the xoom too. Can definitely not recommend at this stage."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have been fortunate enough to own three different tablets so far, but have to say that the Xoom has been the most fun, and the most productive. The recent update to Honeycomb 3.1 has made a noticeable difference in performance, and with the use of a fold-up stand and a Bluetooth keyboard, I find that I no longer need to carry around my notebook (which was both heavier and had less battery life).\n\nBattery life on the Xoom has been superb even on days when I end up watching a lot of videos. The Xoom also is one of the few WiFi only tablets to have a functional GPS chip, and that has come in handy on more than one occasion.\n\nOverall, I would encourage anyone considering a tablet to get this one!"}

With free video players able to watch virtually any file format, able to play any type of music file, read any type of book file.  Able to have an internet experience equal to the one on your pc.  Also able to watch tv at any of the station sites directly, such as cbs.com, fox.com, etc.  The only negative I would currently say is that it still does not read the sd card although the slot is available, this will be updated eventually, but seems ridiculous for it to be taking so long.  One other silly glitch is that the xoom doesn't come with the internet browser set for desktop, but rather for android device.  It is easy enough to change, but with no instructions it requires a few minutes of research.  Very simply type about:debug in the address bar.  After that you hit the menu button on the top right and the settings tab appears tap that, then tap ua string, then choose desktop.  Seems odd that the settings tab doesn't appear unless you type about:debug in the address line, but really only a minor complaint in what overall seems to be one of the better purchases I have made, infact I like it so much I purchased this one, my second, for my wife--who also loves it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I took a long time to decide which tablet I wanted to buy. My brother and my friends all have iPads an iPad 2s, but I didn't know anybody who had a Xoom and the WiFi version was just about to launch. After reading countless reviews, watching tons of video comparisons, and thinking hard about what I wanted my tablet  to do, I went with the Xoom. I got my Xoom the first week of April, and I've found that it's like an extra body part at this point.\n\nThe operating system is fantastic. Honeycomb 3.1 is the version I'm on now, and it provides a great experience for using apps, browsing the Internet (no other tablet beats the Xoom at this so far), sending email, or playing games. While the Android Market still has some catching up to do on apps, most of the necessary apps are there at this point. Netflix is the biggest missing app right now.\n\nThe Xoom is a little heavier than the iPad 2, but the bigger screen and better web experience make up for it in a big way. Right now there's some newer Android tablets hitting the market that all look great, but the WiFi Xoom should be a satisfying purchase for just about anybody.\n\nNote: If you are planning on putting videos on your Xoom, DVD Catalyst is an excellent program I've used to convert my DVD collection to optimized files for playback on the Xoom. It's been great for travel."}

I know Google has a lot of things coming down the pipeline but right now this devices is just an oversize Android phone that does less than my Android phone.  A large portion of the apps in the Android Marketplace just plain don't work on Xoom's honeycomb OS or the formatting is so off that the app is unusable.\n\nThe unit seems a little heavy for how small it is and it's not the most comfortable thing to use, but neither is any tablet at this point.  I think if you are going to get one of these a case or something to help prop it up is a must unless you like placing it on your lap and hunching over to type on it.  Also, the on-screen keyboard was a little too laggy to comfortably type anything longer than a few words.\n\nThe screen resolution was nice but I was expecting it to be a little crisper/more vibrant like my co-worker's iPad 2.\n\nBattery life seems good, I think I actively used it for a good 7-8 hours or so and it was still at 25%.\n\nI really, really wanted to love this product but I think if you are looking for a WiFi tablet the iPad 2 is the most refined right now (as much as I hate saying that).\n\nAt the end of the day content is what matters for me and right now the content just isn't there yet for this product.  I'll check back in another 6 months or so but I'm sure by that time there will be a new \"gotta have it\" Android tablet."}

I bought the Xoom without ever seeing it up close (but I read up about it for at least a month), and because I love my Android phone so much (HTC Incredible), I decided to take the plunge, and buy this for my wife and I. I wanted to buy a tablet that my wife would be able to use (we just had a baby) in bed, or on the couch so that she didn't have to go to our desktop in the office, or have a bulky laptop sitting around. I often see her browsing the internet, or using the multitude of apps that we have (Angry Birds is by far her favorite), while taking care of the baby at the same time.\n\nFlash 10.3 (currently) as you probably have heard rocks on this tablet. While there are ways to work around not having flash on the iPad 2, that doesn't change the fact that it does not have it. The Xoom may not have the extensive library of apps that the Ipad has, but that is only because both the iPhone and iPad were the first ones out, and the Android system followed later. Each day more and more apps are coming into the Market.\n\nWhile I can't do an extensive Xoom vs iPad 2 review like others, I know what I like, and the Xoom is it. The iPad 2 seems very user friendly, but it doesn't seem like you can do a lot with it. It seems like just a supersized iPhone. The Xoom doesn't feel like my HTC Incredible, it feels like so much more. I'm still only scratching the surface with my Xoom, and I have no doubt that in a few months I will be light years farther than where I am today. Don't take my word for it though, try it out for yourself with an open mind, and maybe you'll see what I do."}

Yes, it lacks Flash but that's not a killer for us.\n\nI wanted a tablet and thought we should have a non-Apple alternative. So, I bought the Xoom primarily on the strength of the review comparing the Xoom and iPad to Chess and Checkers. It was very persuasive.\n\nThe Xoom is FAST and I've never had to force an app off. But the dearth of useful apps is amazing. Sure it has Flash, but I've tried seven or eight web browsers and find them all to be lacking in one way or another, sometimes two. Even the Google/Android browser is very difficult to use to enter text in fields on websites; the editor function is crude and difficult to use.\n\nI want to like the Xoom, and I do for its speed. It sleeps quickly, wakes quickly, boots quickly. It can switch apps quickly.\n\nBut Android is not ready for prime time, and the lack of apps by comparison to those for the Apple is quite surprising.\n\nAnd I'm not ready to got XDA Developers or some other site for updates.\n\nI'm typing this review on my notebook PC."}

This is a great device for convenient everyday use, not a complete laptop/desktop PC replacement.  It's easy to type on, but it's not something you would want to use if you're constantly typing.  For that, a laptop/desktop is better suited. If you are just looking to plink around on the couch or have something light for on the go, this device is amazing.  It's way more convenient to use for a home portable device because there is no boot time and the battery lasts about 10 times longer than your standard laptop.  The Motorola case is terrible.  Don't waste 40 bucks on it.  If you want a great case for this device look at the Zoogue case genius for the xoom, it is MUCH better.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "For about 2 months, I spent time reading reviews, playing with demo units in stores, and just arguing with myself over whether to purchase an iPad or the Xoom. Both of them seemed like great items, and I had trouble finding that \"deciding factor.\" The iPad comes from Apple, who has a history of making very well designed and well refined items - And it is. They have also been in the game longer, so there are plenty more Apps for the iPad. The Xoom, on the other hand, is a new kid to the game, and comes with Android 3.0 \"Honeycomb\", also a new system to the tablet market. The Xoom is a good piece of hardware and the operating system are nice, and after a few weeks of use I can truly say I am happy with the purchase. There are not many \"Tablet Friendly\" apps available for the Xoom (I hope that will change soon), and the interface is not a real intuitive one. Even though I would rate myself an \"Advanced\" computer user, I'm still learning and discovering new things to do. While I'm sure the iPad would have provided a more simple experience, I was looking for a more powerful experience, and that's exactly what I got. I have Flash in the browser, I can download files as I please, and all around I feel like I control the device, not the other way around. I'm definitely looking forward to more apps showing up in the market, but I'm happy as it stands as well. My only word of warning: Be wary of the \"official\" Motorola case. It seems like the most obvious choice, but I have been very unhappy with the quality of it. It feels more like a cheap \"Universal\" case than a manufacturer's case. Explore other options."}

The system runs fast and is intuitive.  It offers more hardware flexibility than the iPad.  All of this information is pretty well said in other official and personal reviews.\n\nI've only had one little hickup with the Xoom compared to the iPod Touch.  The Xoom's touch pad seems to be a little picky on some selection boxes.  If you do not tap directly on the box or webpage link, it will not select the item.  It seems like the iPod touch is more forgiving or intuitive.  That really is the worst I can say about the Xoom.  It hasn't really impacted my experience that much.\n\nAs for folks who complain about the SD slot not being active, I would agree that Motorola and Google rushed this out to beat the iPad 2 to market.

I shall give this xoom a few more months and if nothing has changed then I shall by sum thing else or will just go back to old reliable PCs."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I've been looking for a tablet like this for some time.\n\nFirst off let me say that I have an I pad that I use a LOT for referencing large PDF manuals for work along with the checking of e-mail and watching netflix, etc... a few things like not being able to use flash (which my work website uses heavily), not being able to get common words I use in my work into the I pad dictionary, not being able to port my MS documents onto my tablet without reformztting them every time, and always having to e-mail myself docs I want on my I pad or use iTunes to get them on my iPad left me wanting a more versatile tablet.\n\nThe Xoom does all of this easily and is a real joy to use.  Now comes the caviat.  I'm not sure who at Motorola thought that using that teeny little charging adapter was a good idea.  It doesn't seat all the way and I can see that it will not last long before it breaks.  Combine that with the fact that if the charging port and the headphone jacks are plugged in at the same time (if you are watchig a movie and charging at the same time) you can't hold the tablet in landscape orientation without the risk of breaking the charger connector off (charging port and headphone jacks are opposite each other on the long sides of the tablet).  There are a few other small things that bug me (like the volume buttons that are hard to operate and the small bugs in the Gingerbread OS) but I could deal with those.  The charging port/connector fragility is a deal breaker for me.  I want something I can expect to work for the next few years and this Xoom (typing on it right now), though I love it compared to my I pad, I can't trust it won't break on me in the near future so it is going back to Best Buy tomorrow.\n\nHopefully the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 will come out soon and not have any bad design flaws like this.\n\nIf you don't think you will use a tablet a lot and can set it down or in a charging dock while it charges then this would be an awesome tablet.  It charges fast and the battery lasts about as long as my iPad (not to mention all the things it does that my I pad doesn't.)"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "The Xoom is without a doubt the best tablet device I've seen.  For power, performance, functionality, and customization it can't be beat.  I've been using the Xoom for over 2 months now and have not had any problems.  I've moved huge amounts of books, pictures and videos back an forth between my PC an the Xoom without any problems.  Simply plug the included cable into your PC's USB port and drag and drop.  No forced software or required company accounts (like you need for iPad-iTunes).  I've installed over 50 apps from both Amazon and Google Markets without any problems and still have over half of the Xoom free for more data.  Outstanding and smooth video performance as well as superior screen resolution.  The Xoom does require a few extra minutes to learn because of all the features it has, but there are plenty of tutorials and there is a help app (with videos) to walk you through everything if you're a beginner.  The cameras (front and back) are both excellent.  Wireless networking worked right away without problems at home, work, and in public locations.  Excellent battery life as well.  The Xoom has advanced and excellent hardware that won't be outdated, requiring the purchase of a new version of the product, anytime soon. Also has tabbed web browsing and works with Flash video and games. Cons would be: as of 05-08-11, Motorola has not yet released the promised software update to activate the External SD Card slot.  The Xoom does not support ad-hoc networks, so you can't use your internet data connection from your phone with the Xoom.  Other than these 2 cons, I've found the Xoom to be simply outstanding.  Also, as always, Amazon delivered when promised and the product was in excellent condition.  Check out Motorola's website for a comparison of hardware specs with other tablets.  The Xoom is best. Get one if you can."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I love you Apple and always will, but I just had to go with the Xoom and am so happy I did.\n\nHowever, when I am in the market for a new tablet down the road, I can still be taken back. I will go into my purchase with an open mind like I did for this one. I will do hours of research, demo multiple products, and talk to many people before I make a decision. Andoid amazed me with the xoom this time around. I enjoy my iPod touch, but it got boring pretty fast. When playing with the Ipad 2 and then the xoom, I knew the xoom was it. Ipad 2 was just my iPod touch on steroids. Still cool, but show me more. (Yes, I know there is more, but you get the gist of what I am saying).\n\nI spent quite a bit of time researching both the ipad and xoom, and then the ipad 2 vs the xoom. After demoing both extensively, the clear choice for me was the Xoom - hands down. I don't have anything bad to say about the ipad 2, just many, many, many more positive things to say about the xoom. You have so much more freedom on the xoom and constantly get wowed by finding new things it can do. The fact that it has Flash is reason enough to choose the xoom. Without even looking at the other advantages, Flash should be reason enough. I love the fact that it has stereo speakers as well. This way I am able to watch movies on it with friends and not have to worry about purchasing earphone adapators. I love it!\n\nIn summary: If you want a device where you are in complete control (driver seat) and want to customize your experience, then get the xoom. You will NEVER get bored as there is soooo much you can do and change. If you don't care about being in control and customizing it, then get the Ipad 2 where the IOS is in complete control and you are in the passenger seat. Still an awesome product, but it is not for me and I am a  typical guy that loves his electronics and wants to push the limits and see what it can do. I see that with the xoom much more than the I pad. Just my opinion.\n\nThe widgets on the Xoom are awesome!!!!!!!  If you do not know what a widget is because you are an Apple person, PLEASE google widegst on the xoom and see what they are like. You will be wowed. You get an amazing experience from downloading widgets. I just love how fullt customizable the xoom is. I will never get bored with it like I would with the ipad. The ipad is too simple and bland. Your experience will be the same on it whether it is week one or year 3. Not much changes. But with the xoom, you get a new experience any time you want. This is something you won't understand until you play around with one. If Google had a Google store set up like the Apple stores, I would bet my life savings that they would see a drastic increase in sales on android based tablets. Apple is genius for allowing customers to play around with the ipad2 whenever they want. Very, very smart. If people had the opportunity to do that with the xoom, we might see more people switching from apple to Google - like I did.\n\nI have honestly converted a few ipad lovers to xoom lovers by just allowing them to play around on my xoom and me showing them what it is capable of. They truly get wowed and every time say \"what!!!! I had no idea it could do that. That is awesome!!!\". They ask themselves out loud a few times why the ipad 2 can't be like that. The advertising for the xoom is just awful and fails to show the true power of the xoom. Apple is so smart in what they do and have been able to get so many customers - and more importantly, keep them. Apple fans are probably the most loyal customers in the world!!! I was/am one, but then decided to venture out and see what else was out there. Boy am i glad I did. I will still stick with apple for my laptop (as of now) and for my mini Ipad (iPod touch). In my opinin the I pad is an iPod touch on steroids. Can be a good thing or bad depending on how you look at it. Everyone will see it their own way.\n\nThe ipad2 is a great product. Very sleek, sexy, and functionally sound, but it is too simple and boring for a guy like me. In my opinion, the ipad2 is for the older generation (50+) that just wants the simple things in a tablet. The xoom is more for the younger generation (18+) and anyone who likes to have complete control over their technology and loves discovering new things time and time again. It is a fact that the xoom can be more customized than the I pad. There is more to change and that can't be proven wrong.\n\nBoth leaders have great products. I am a huge apple fan, but I just can't deny that the xoom is better (for me at least). Unfortunately, Apple fans will rarely admit there are better products out there even though they haven't even tried the other products. I run into that a lot and it disturbs me. REALLY annoys me. I get in discussions with many of my fellow apple fan friends (I am one) about other products and this is how it usually goes:\n\nMe: What do you think about the xoom?\nApple Fan: Just another product trying to be like the ipad.\nMe: Did you realize it can do quite a bit more than the ipad, and even the ipad 2? I have played with both for hours on end.\nApple Fan: I promise you the ipad is better than the xoom.\nMe: How do you know that?\nApple fan: because it is made by Apple and they just make better products than any other company.\nMe: Have you played around with the xoom?\nApple Fan: No, I don't need to. I already know the ipad 2 is better.\nMe: .........ok..........\n\nI see this way too much. People love the brand and chose the product because of it. It is typical for that to happen, but I hate it when people don't even test out another product before opening their mouth and saying negative things about the competition. Opinions are fine, but have some substance to go with them. Unfortunately, so many people out there will not understand what the xoom is truly capable of until they play around with it. But once you do, you will be hooked (if you are like me). Open minded apple fans will be pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe stuff I love about my xoom. These are just my top favorite things. Plus, the Ipad 2 lacks these as well.\n - Flash:  an necessity for browsing the internet on a tablet. I hated browsing the web without it on the ipad. No comparison.\n\n - USB: I love being able to add any files I want to my xoom. I have TONS of movies on my computer and love being able to add them to my xoom very easily  and not being limited to the Itunes store to get things.\n\n- SD card and storage: the USB allows you to back up things to external hardrives, which you can't do with the I pad. You can also buy a SD card and turn your 32 gb xoom'into a 64 gb. Apple is smart in what they do because they get more money out of their fans by limiting them, but man is it annoying when you run out of gigs. I hated it when it happened on my iPod. So annoying. Happy I don't have to worry about that with the xoom. There may be ways around it with the I pad, but not simple ways. And no mater what the ways are, xoom'will still have more options. Also nice to easily transfer images and video from camera, which I pad lacks this easy and convienent option.\n\n- Widgets: Adding widgets to the home screen make for an incredible experience. I have the CNN widget, e-mail, USA today, and other news widgets on my home screen. I don't even have to open them to see what is going on in the world. Amazing and this is something ipad 2 users just will not understand. If you do not know what a widget is, PLEASE google it and watch videos of widgets on the xoom. Ipad does not have them and many ipad fans are wondering when they will get them.\n\n- Freedom: Again, not limited to itunes or even the android market. You want to download something from a websiote (movie, music, etc.) then go right ahead. Even download free content without any problem. Also, the ability to completely customize the device how ever you want. Unlike the ipad, you are in complete control of the xoom and not the other way around. On the Ipad, IOS is in control.\n\n- Stereo Speakers: I love being able to watch videos or listen to music out loud with friends and not needing earphones. Perfect for parties.\n\n- Android market: Apparently this week it was announced that the Android market will surpass Apple in the amoutn of apps in the store. Pretty big deal considering how much later Android started. (This has to tell you something about people loving android)."}

After playing with it for a couple of weeks, I could not be more pleased. It performs as advertised. The operating system delivers. The sync with Gmail is seamless. On screen navigation is intuitive. The only issue I have had is that the browser will some times opt for a mobile site instead of the desktop one. You can reset that though through a hidden menu (about:debug on browser).  Just do a Google search for step by step instructions. If you have a wireless network printer you might like purchasing the PrinterShare app. Another app to consider up front is Quick office Pro HD. As to a case, I purchased the Navi-tech first and was not happy with it. I then purchased the Motorola Protective Portfolio case. It's pricey but works much better. This XOOM was the wifi one. Had I known I would use it this much, I might have purchased the wireless version."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "There are really only two problems with the XOOM: it is expensive (almost dropped a star on that) and Motorola sadly doesn't know how to market it effectively so sales have sadly lagged.\n\nI waited until the WiFi only version was available as I can tether it to my phone when I'm mobile - no need for another expensive carrier contract at all and so no lock in to achieve the price point. The WiFi implementation is very solid. I have had zero problems connecting to a variety of hot spots, my phone's portable hot spot or my home/work 802.11 networks. It just works.(Magic after years of jumping through hoops with Windows PCs, and even a few hoops with Macs.)\n\nThe device itself is very stable - no crashes, no hangs and no bugs in the base system. (Actually I bought two of them and they are both completely stable.) It took only minutes to bring up - without ever needing to read anything. Just power on and start answering the questions - and even that start up dialog was very short. Subsequently, while I was exploring Honeycomb, it downloaded and installed the applications my Android phone has installed - along with their context that was saved in my gmail account. This was all effortless. Very impressive on the part of Google Honeycomb and also Motorola's platform engineering.\n\nSetting up sync with Exchange was easy - and I have multiple email accounts on multiple Exchange servers belonging to different organizations. Honeycomb makes them all transparent and unifies my email, calendar entries and contacts - tracking the origin of each and preventing any cross pollution. That is something you really cannot do from Windows Outlook.\n\nOverall performance is outstanding. It handles 3D graphics without any hesitation. The Honeycomb UI is excellent and very well designed for the tablet form factor.\n\nApplications work well with Honeycomb - for the most part. Just like when the iPad first launched, there are some that don't scale yet to the screen size - though recently many have updated to fix that problem.\n\nRecently I carried out the ultimate test without any problems: an entire day of meetings without a laptop - living entirely on Android Honeycomb and the XOOM. Email/calendar/contacts were all transparently synchronized with multiple Exchange servers (belonging to different organizations), note taking was easy and any Microsoft Office files were easily handled by apps pre-installed on Honeycomb. The only issue I had was holding onto the device as everyone in the meeting kept asking to see it and then didn't want to hand it back ...\n\nWith the WiFi XOOM, Motorola has an obvious good alternative to a laptop for those who primarily use their laptop for email, web browsing and handling files such as PDFs, Microsoft Office files, etc. It is also a great Amazon Kindle platform, so for road warriors this is a good all in one device that simplifies their mobile infrastructure. I've tried out a few games and they all work well, so I suspect that is another plus point for the platform but since I'm not a big PC gamer, I can't really comment on how extensive the game capabilities are.\n\nGiven a good Android phone (or other type of phone) with tethering enabled, I would recommend people not bother with the 3G or 4G versions of the XOOM. WiFi suffices and a XOOM WiFi costs about the same as the WAN versions do when bought under contract, which, of course, then shackles them with a carrier contract (plus carrier provided crapware - one day carriers really will work out that their business is bandwidth, not applications and content). Unlocked 3G/4G versions are available but they cost more than the WiFi only version.\n\nMotorola should seriously market this as an enterprise device to IT departments. They could very easily, and securely, lower their licensing costs by moving to a Honeycomb client infrastructure. For enterprise use you can also use the built in HDMI capability together with a keyboard (either USB or Motorola's wireless keyboard) to create a very effective desktop system when docked to one of the excellently designed docking stations (which I have separately reviewed).\n\nI highly recommend the XOOM to anyone who can afford it. Though I know that Apple fan boys and girls will put a hex on me for saying so, from my experience of the iPad, the XOOM is more than its equal. Add to that the fact that you have a lot more control over the platform and are not tied to the tyranny of iTunes, plus can actually view Flash, and you ultimately have a far more useful platform that you can completely adapt and customize to your own needs, all without paying taxes to Appleland.\n\n(Hastily dons flame proof suit in anticipation of the zealous response from those who have drunk their fair share of Apple's magic cider ...)\n\nMotorola should, however, undertake a serious cost reduction program for getting the fat out of its manufacturing BOM. Just $200 lower in street price would seriously dent the iPad world. ASUS and Acer already have Honeycomb tablets hitting the $400 price point, why not a US company like Motorola? I'm sure such a venerable company is up to the challenge ...  ;-)\n\nGo for it Motorola!"}

I like the Xoom UI (User Interface) and after spending some time with it I have gotten to appreciate the Zen of the device.  Like all new devices it takes some time and experimentation to getting use to the  UI and to understand some of the icons and their meanings, but it has been mostly try this or try that and eventually you get what you want.\n\nFair Warning: I chose the Xoom based on a review of four 10 inch Tablets with the requirement of working GPS in a WiFi model that would get internet access based on cellphone sharing.  I wanted a tablet that could be mounted in my RV and could provide provide useful navigational data without requiring excessive interaction with the driver.\n\nGood Points\n* exceptional screen display with plenty of resolution\n* smooth responsive touch screen display that's a pleasure to use\n* easy initial setup, had IMAP email working within 5 minutes of turning on the unit for first time\n* email display of google mail very intuitive with useful split screen\n* on-screen keyboard very easy to use\n* very sensitive WIFI receiver\n* very sensitive GPS receiver - works inside my house\n* mounts easily in a car/RV without requiring physical modification or velcro tabs (modified Motorola case and mounted it with velcro tabs)\n* access to the large Android market\n* easy to clean screen\n\nBad Points\n* poor documentation except for basic functions\n* more unusual functions not documented such as cut & paste\n* charging requires a separate 12v connection - no USB charge port\n* a bit on the heavy side\n\nWould I buy it again - YES!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "This Xoom is a good tablet but it has a few kinks that need to be worked out.\nFor example, the mini SD card slot is not yet functional.\nAnd, some programs, like Pandora, do not work on this device for some reason.\nThe bigger problem for me, however, is that this is simply too large and heavy to be easily portable in my shoulder bag.  It is surprisingly heavy for its size.  To me, a 7 inch screen is a more \"one-hand-holdable\" size (and much lighter), and the 10 inch (whether this Xoom, or iPad, or whatever) is simply too big to be used well with one hand.  Personally I am surprised that iPad has sold as well as it has, because I think it is too big to be portable; 10\" screen is OK for coffee table use, not carrying.\nI'm still looking for a quality 7\" screen tablet, and I'm surprised and disappointed that Motorola chose to copy Apple's size preference.  I want Android (Honeycomb, especially) so I guess I have to wait for that in a 7 inch size just a little longer.  Look at the Samsung Galaxy and Blackberry Playbook - THAT is a great usable and portable size.  But they are not Android Honeycomb with dual core processors.\nBottom line, even though I'm rating it 4 stars, I returned my Xoom for a refund.  As much as I liked it, the Xoom was just too expensive a 'toy' to be less than perfect...."}

As I have an Android based phone logging into my gmail account automatically loaded any apps that I had already purchased or downloaded onto the Xoom tablet as well. Once again, super easy. Being able to add storage with a microSD card is a nice feature as well. The battery seems to last quite awhile as well, although I have nothing to compare it to other then a regular cell phone.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Is it possible for a product to be both superior to the competition AND inferior at the same time? In the case of the Motorola Xoom I would argue yes, and here is why.\n\nTablets are built for media consumption. You watch video's, listen to music, browse the web, play a game or two, and then you move on with your life. If you need to do any word processing or spreadsheet work you will most likely belly up to the desktop, or pull out your notebook.\n\nXoom has attempted to bridge the gap between the two. As a media consumption device, it is not quite up to iPad standards. The main reason is the lack of an iTunes like store where you can rent or buy movies and music. Android diehards would argue that it is possible but you need to have various programs to first rip the content, then transfer. Maybe I am a simpleton, but I just want to press a few buttons and have my content, and yes I am willing to pay for it (Google/Amazon, are you listening). This alone makes the Android experience inferior to Apple's iOS ecosystem.\n\nWhere the Xoom shines is the potential it has in being able to become more notebook-ish. The OS gives a sense on depth that is hard to describe, especially when compared to iOS.\n\nI gave the Xoom four stars because it has proven to be a very useful device. It is well made, excellent feature set, and has a lot of room for growth.\n\nI deducted one star (in in a few months maybe more) because it is clear that this is still an early version of the tablet specific OS. Some applications tend to crash a lot (Pandora), and the keyboard has some lag to it. I anticipate that these will be corrected over time. Secondly, the media purchasing for anything Android is abysmal. Should Amazon or Google fail to address the 400lb gorilla in the room which is the lack of an iTunes like store for music and video content, then it will be an also-ran.\n\nIn the end, it is an excellent start. If you want easy media consumption, the iPad is the clear winner. However, should Google and or Amazon get its act together and cobble a partnership and bring content to the masses, then Apple had better watch out."}

This is a fantastic tablet and I am very happy with it. From the customization, the ability to multi-task, notifications and much more...I would purchase this over again. I have to disagree with those that say this was released too early. I haven't felt that in one bit. My biggest fear was the applications but that has not been a problem for me at all. I am pretty confident that you would not regret this purchase. Do your research before you simply by and iPad just because its an iPad. You might find that the features of the Xoom is better suited for your needs."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Before starting with the review, please let me tell you that you should be very skeptical about many reviews out there that speak bad about this product. Many of these reviews seem to be written by people that have read the specs of the product but have never actually used it. These reviews made me very skeptical about buying the Xoom, to the point that I bought it only because I could return it. After 6 days with it I'm not giving my Xoom back, and here's why:\n\nConstruction and appearance\nThe Xoom is solid and well built. Some reviewers point out that the back panel is made of cheap plastic and that it easily gets very dirty. This is not true. Grab a Xoom and you'll feel and solid and well built product in your hands. The Xoom also weights pretty much the same as the iPad 1.\n\nScreen\nOne of the things I love about this tablet is the screen. The screen's resolution is higher than the iPad's and it has a slightly higher pixel density, so text and pictures look sharper and clearer. Some reviews out there say that the screen lacks contrast, brightness and color saturation. This is false too. I see no difference in terms of color quality and contrast with respect to the iPad.\n\nPerformance\nAll graphical components and animations are fluid. Switching between apps is a darling. Even loading up apps and immediately switching through them at an insanely fast pace (which you would not do during normal use of the product) is smooth and instant. Multi-tasking is a charm. You can switch from apps at the touch of a button, and all apps remain in the same state as when you left them. This is real multitasking.\n\nWeb browsing experience\nThis is perhaps the point where the Xoom really outperforms the iPad, and by far. Websites load up fast and are beautiful to watch on the screen. What you get with the Xoom is a REAL browsing experience. Websites work and render as they were designed to. Things that I can do with the Xoom that are not possible with the iPad include: 1) Accessing Flash content, 2) uploading files to websites. For example, I can login to Facebook and upload a file or a video. This is not possible with the ipad, since it has to accessible file system. 3) Access advanced features such as Facebook chat console. 4) Multi-tab browsing. 5) Browsing websites with panels (like Gmail, where you have a left panel with your emails and a right panel with content. 6) Word-wrapping text. Zoom in in to see text as big as you want and the Xoom can rearrange the text so you won't have to scroll sideways to read it all.\n\nIntegration with cloud services\nNaturally, the Xoom integrates effortlessly with Google services. When I had my iPad, I paid for mobileme services, but to my surprise, the integration between the ipad and mobileme was not satisfying. Perhaps this comes as consequence of Apple being mostly a hardware company and Google being, well, you know how good Google is at offering services. Gmail, Calendar, Contacts, Google Talk and Voice, Buzz, Latitude and searching features are all outstanding.\n\nGoogle Maps\nGoogle maps is definitively way better on Android than on the ipad. Those familiar with Android know that I'm talking about. On the Xoom you'll get an oversized version of Android Google maps, where you can select different layers to see (Map, satellite, terrain, traffic, latitude integration), look up businesses and get all their contact information and other data, pinch, zoom, tilt, pan as fast as you want and the Xoom will keep up rendering and displaying the map with no graphical delays.\n\nFile System\nDownload an app like Astro and you will get full access to the file system. This is a great feature that is missing in apple products. For example, I can take HD pictures or video with my cellphone, transfer them to the Xoom via bluetooth or wifi, browse the file system to look for them, where I can choose to open them up on the photo gallery app, any other app that processes images, or select the files as attachments to send with Gmail or any other file-sharing app you may have installed. You really have access to a small 32gb hard drive and you can do inside it whatever you want.\n\nInternet tethering\nThis is another point where many reviews are mistaken. I have an unlimited data plan with my cellphone provider and I used my phone to tether my ipad and connect it to the Internet. I bought a wifi-only Xoom, and for me it was critical to preserve this function. I use an HTC Desire HD phone that sets up an adhoc wifi network. The Xoom connects to it flawlessly.\n\nUser Interface and ease of use\nThe ipad is simpler than Android. This is a matter of fact. Using the ipad is very easy and it is a charm for people with no technical skills. Android, on the other hand, offers much more functionality and customization capabilities. This means that menus and the interface in general have more options, more features, that is, more items that can confuse you. I have no trouble using Android 3.0 and I love all the power it gives me. However, people with very limited skills using electronic devices will prefer the ipad because of its simplicity.\n\nBattery life\nBattery life in the ipad is better than on the Xoom. This should not be a surprise, since the battery on the Xoom has to power real multi-tasking and Flash websites which suck the battery up. Whereas I got 2-3 days of battery with the ipad, I get 1.5 with the Xoom. If you can charge your Xoom every night, this should not be a problem.\n\nApps\nApp store has much more apps than Android market. However, so far I have been able to find an app for Android that does what I did with the ipad. I am missing nothing, even though some apps for the ipad are not available for android so you will have to look for an app from a different programmer. I do not use the Xoom for gaming, I use it for work. Thus, I had no games on my ipad, and have no games on my Xoom. If you are a heavy gamer, the lack of apps might be a disadvantage for you.\n\nNotifications\nThis is another point where the Xoom clearly beats the ipad. Instead of the lousy pop-ups of the ipad, the Xoom offers you a notification center on the bottom right corner of the screen, which is accessible at any time, and displays alerts and notifications from email, calendar, facebook, skype, google talk and others.\n\nWhy I didn't give the Xoom 5 stars\nI rated this product with 4 stars. Here's why:\n\n- There is still no support for the SD card. One of the disadvantages of the ipad is that you can't increase its storage. The Motorola Xoom does have a port for inserting an SD card, but this feature is still not operational (apparently, Android does not support it yet).\n\n- Apps that crash are more frequent than on the ipad. Even apps that natively come installed with the Xoom have crashed. Now, don't get too alarmed with this, it does not haven very often, and recovering from it is something that takes about 2 seconds. However, it is clear that 1) Android 3.0 still needs to get some bugs out and is a less mature product that iOS (which has been around for some years now), and Google needs to work better on the quality and stability of the apps people publish in the Android market. Although Apple exerts a tight control on the apps and content you can get (one of the reasons why I decided to ditch Apple), they do make sure the apps on the app store are reliable and stable.\n\n- You need a special cable to charge the Xoom. Though it was a microUSB port, you cannot charge the Xoom with it. Although this is not a disadvantage compared to the ipad (you need that big white connector all the time), it would be great if you could charge the Xoom via USB and have to carry one cable only."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have had the Xoom tablet now for about 2 weeks. I can say that the tablet is everything I need to use from a personal and business aspect.\n\nPersonal Use.\n\nI use this for email, web surfing, and games, and reading ebooks(Kindle over Google Books) Better Book selection plus the book are located on the computer not the cloud.\n\nBusiness Use.\n\nRDP (Remote Control Computers) using WYSE software.\nBusiness Documents using DocsOnTheGo which integrated in Google docs already it makes it easy to send document via email via a share command.\nTesting Business Application that Run on flash (Sorry Apple)\n\nOne down side to this product until Cisco licenses it to Google is that the tablet can do VPN IPSEC but not with group authenticate. In which most companies use, but a work around is I leave your computer on at home and RDP into that box and VPN to work.  If you are setting up RDP on your computer I would consult someone at your work IT department. Because, it requires someone with knowledge of IP routing and port forwarding on the computers modem or router. If you have more than 2 routers that makes even more fun like I have in use on my network.\n\nA tablet is not designed to replace a computer but more of a complement for any users who need to travel light but can still get everything they need on the go. Personally, I think the tablet is a good decision for anyone how is traveling a lot or is just a normal computer user that just uses email, internet for basic usage. You can do a whole lot more with this tablet than just the basics. Look at the Android App Store and looks at the different software either free for purchased to see if it will fill your niche that you need for program needs.\n\nTime and market will tell which one between apple and android.\n\nOne of the main reason I also choose Xoom is that this is the development platform for Android's Honeycomb tablet OS. So when new releases are launched this device should get is first over others because it is plain Jane OS and doesn't have anything added on top OS (IE. Samsung's TouchWIZ). That would require other companies to develop for and make you wait for 6 months to a year for them to release the OS update to you. When android is already 2 version ahead.\n\nThere are still come bogs that I think developers need to work out in their software in order to make this a perfect system, but I would recommend this tablet to anyone.\n\nOne thing someone might say on this is wifi only, well here is a little secrete I do I have android cell phone with an unlimited data plan and I connected through my cellphone via a wifi tether and I now have a fully mobile tablet why pay for a data plan of anything over a GB of data, gets very expensive."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I fully agree with the guy who made the chess analogy. This is a great device but you need to be able to look beyond the obvious to use it well. An instruction manual bigger than 2 pages might be nice. I am a former iPhone user (very satisfied with the switch) and have played extensively with iPads owned by colleagues. Very limited in their productivity and Apple's idea of multi-tasking is laughable. They mostly just seemed like large game-boys to me.\nXoom seems to lend itself more to productivity and is much closer to the laptop replacement that i am looking for in such a device than the iPad, though not quite there yet.\n\nAnyone who complains about the lack of apps hasn't actually tried downloading apps for it. As of 01May2011 I have 96 non-sprint specific apps on my Evo phone. of them only 6 have not work perfectly on my xoom. of the 6, 4 didn't make full use of screen space, and one i could not get to install. Not a single one was downloaded from the \"tablet specific\" store. So yes while few android apps are specifically made for Tablets, at least 90% of them seem to work just fine even if they are not \"optimized\".\n\nThose who complain that it doesn't play all movie formats need to do a little research as there are a number of great free apps that work perfectly on xoom and will play all movie formats i have tried. I recommend MoboPlayer. Its free and works for every format i have thrown at it.\n\nFor music; Try Mixzing. could use an interface uplift but works on all sorts of music formats including my music i thought was eternally corrupted with iTunes formatting and DRM.\n\nBattery life has been great thus far. i did not recharge it at all for the first 4 days fairly heavy use. I understand that when watching movies, you can expect 10+ hours. I cannot confirm this but i can confirm that i have gotten at least 15+ hours of what i would call normal usage (some office work, some movies, some games, a lot of downloading, etc) and this took it down to 30% battery life.\n\nThe weight issue is null to me. I have held it in my hands performing a variety of functions for hours on end and experienced no fatigue what so ever. The convenience of Flash far out-weighs the extra 4 ounces this thing has over other devices.\n\nWith the Flash issue fixed, i currently have only one technical complaint, but i am confident it will be addressed soon. That of course is the still lack of ability to make use of the SD slot. This one thing, in my opinion, makes Xoom, non-comparable to the iPad. So many reviews focus on internal memory. Once the SD slot is activated, Xoom memory will be essentially unlimited.\n\nOther than that i still feel that the price is a big hurdle. As far as tablets go, i believe this will give you more bang for the buck than the leading tablet, however 600 bucks for a device that is not yet a laptop replacement still feels steep to me. If not for the fact that i am in the military and getting deployed in a few weeks, i would never have purchased this at $599. Still when it comes to convenience of stowage, tablets are hard to beat.\n\n-----------------Update-------------------------\n\nBought mine with Deployment looming. Now 3 months into deployment its absolutely the most satisfying purchase i have made in years. Use it for everything including talking to my wife with google talk regardless of which device (computer, phone, or her own xoom) she is using.  Also of note, a friend of mine is now on his 3rd Ipad began because they are so fragile. Apparently they cannot withstand the slightest drop. I have dropped the xoom from my top (approximately 8 feet) rack and merely a few scratches and no detriment to functionality. Also of note, i tend to find better wi-fi signal with my xoom, than my liberty buddies that use iPad. Laptops still get better reception unfortunatly, but they have to deal with their limited battery life.\n\nPros\n-Flash player\n-Customizable interface\n-great screen quality and pixel count\n-great mobile movie player (download moboPlayer and learn to use it)\n-excellent wi-fi and blue-tooth reception (essential when you are deployed and spend liberty looking for a place with wifi)\n-expandable memory\n-**Durability**\n-**Battery life** (easily get 12 hours of video)\n\nCons\n-SD slot available but still read only\n-Price -> I personally believe that the correct pricing for any tablet should be in the $200-400 range for full functionality."}

It's very pretty, but nothing runs properly on it :)  So as long as you just want to use it for you own personal music player - and you don't plan to Facebook, play games, or check on News and Weather - it might work nicely for you.\n\nOn the plus side, the graphics are nice, and the keyboard is actually quite easy to use.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Reviewing the Motorola Xoom could be a pretty unfair list of things this tablet lacks, so lets get that out of the way right away.\n\nThe Xoom has an SD slot, but it doesn't work (yet). It has the newest version of Android (Honeycomb), but it is pretty unpolished. It runs tablet optimized apps, but there are only 100 or so of them.\n\nOK - with those things, you'd be forgiven if you felt that the Xoom was a bad purchase. But you'd be very, very wrong.\n\nThe Xoom is in my opinion the first REAL alternative to an Apple iPad. Yes - the Samsung Tab came out last year with Android, but it really was nothing but a big version of their phones. No real tablet apps, a phone style browser and very basic hardware.\n\nThe Xoom is what Android tablets should be - the right size, awesome battery life, perfect balance of speed and power and a very, very good first version of a tablet OS from Google.\n\nHoneycomb really is an amazing OS - if you now Android, you'll find your way around just fine - but enough has been tablet optimized to make it \"new\" enough to let go of its Android Froyo/gingerbread past. Thankfully, Google kept the best parts of Android in it - but updated things when needed.\n\nThings that came from the phone versions: the awesome homescreen with widgets and multiple screens, the notification bar.\n\nThings that were radically updated; the browser, the market and the email client.\n\nThe browser still renders pages brilliantly - they really look just like on your desktop. The email client uses the whole screen, and features side by side folder lists and preview and the market was completely rewritten for tablets. And yes - Flash does make a massive difference -- it means sites actually work instead of just displaying half of their content.\n\nThe price is a big issue - it isn't too high, but there is no option for a cheaper (16GB) version - you either pay $599, or $799 (for the 3G version).\n\nAs someone who purchased two of these, I'm not the best person to ask whether the price can be justified - I invested $1200 in them, and I haven't regretted it once. In my opinion, neither will you.\n\nIn closing, I do have one or two things that annoy me personally - the charger is proprietary, and uses a very small pin. You can NOT charge this over USB, so ignore all the MicroUSB Xoom chargers here on Amazon."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "My Xoom's screen started acting weird (it would fade in and out constantly even without automated lighting) so I had to return it. It was probably a defective unit but the problems didn't start to happen until 2-3 days after I first started using it.\n\nSo my review will be based on using the unit during those 3 days:\n1) The first thing I noticed was that the Xoom felt a little heavy. It's weird because I've used the heavier (in terms of grams) Acer Iconia but I felt that the Xoom was much more dense. Perhaps it was the weight distribution? It was quite uncomfortable to hold even with two hands. You should really try this thing in a store before making a purchase. Be sure to feel the other devices too. It might not feel too bad at first, but if you are going to use this tablet extensively then comfortability is very important. I just don't agree with the whole notion of \"being heavy = superior build quality\". Samsung and Apple have been steering towards high quality units that get lighter and lighter every year. Being heavier than the competition is a negative in my book.\n2) The edges felt a little sharp. You'd probably want to get a rubberized cover to solve this. Again, try it at a store before opting for a cover. (buy covers online as they are cheaper)\n3) Screen quality is below standards for the pricing. Apple's IPS display (even with lower pixel density) outclasses the Xoom. (check video reviews or try it in stores) Even cheaper tablets like the Acer Iconia and Asus Transformer have better screen's in terms of brightness and color. That being said, you won't notice it if you don't compare it with different tablets; it's a decent screen, but just not as good as others.\n4) Pricing is pretty bad as I would have liked just a 16 GB version. Might have been a little lighter too.\n5) Battery life was very good. Don't have concrete numbers but they are stated in the product specs.\n6) Industry Standard hardware specs (Tegra 2)\n\nSummary: I pointed out mostly negatives because the competition runs the same software and hardware now-a-days. You'll want to know the differences between the Asus Transformer, Acer Iconia and this Xoom (plus other Android tablets that haven't been released yet). Since they all run Honeycomb, the software experience is practically the same. Honeycomb needs work but it was fine when I used it; apps will come with time.\n\nI believe this tablet just doesn't cut it in terms of price and bulkiness. Try the Asus Transformer for $399 that has a better screen, better weight distribution and optional keyboard docking station. My rating is based on industry comparisons. The Xoom experience wasn't too bad (when it was working that is) but why pay more for the same experience that you can get on better tablets out there?"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I could not wait for this Xoom to arrive once I ordered it.  I've been looking at reviews and tidbits about the tablet market to semi replace my very outdated laptop.  I already own a Droid phone, so I suppose my love was a bit preordained.  I went to town getting a bunch of really cool apps for it right away and discovered in the process that if you use the same gmail account to link it to the market, (most of)the apps on your Droid will suddenly appear on the Xoom as well.  I have yet to decided if that is good or bad.  It's a bit heavy for reading books and the screen times out but I assume I could change that in the settings.  When I plug it in, the charging icon does not always appear, though I know that it charges.  The camera works pretty well, though I've only tried it for stills as of yet.  It seems to be of a sturdy construction and very easy to use.  I put it side by side with an Apple iPad and its screen was not as bright but it does not seem to bother me.  Our friend even took his along on a recent trip to England (where the Droid phone does not work) and managed to find a way for us to use it to call home through wifi, and download map directions for use in the countryside.  (He also took very good photos)  All around I'm very happy with the tablet and my only complaints, like not having software which allows me to send items to my printer (haven't found an app for that yet,) would be software related and I'm assuming, will eventually be resolved.  I think the big difference for me, as compared to the iPad, is not having to use iTunes, a slightly longer (but more narrow) screen, and using the Android system already in use by my cell phone.  Although at a steep price tag (for me, $499) I would recommend it to anyone who's willing to lay out the investment for fun and less expensive applications, web browsing, picture taking and basic word processing."}

Albeit not as often, apps on my ipad2 crash as well...they just don't tell you when it happens and merely returns to the home screen.\nFlash was not shipped with the xoom but I downloaded it from the Android market immediately and it works flawlessly. I have been watching internet videos off the chrome browser.\nThe only time I use the ipad is when I am facetiming with my family who live outside of us because that is one of the most convenient features of it...otherwise it is just a big iPod.\nThe live wallpaper is one of the best features of android...making the device appear \"alive \"and so much sexier.\nWidgets is a must have...especially the YouTube one. It is designed like a Rolodex and let you flip through the videos you subscribed to.\nNotification and multitasking work great together - eg. You are watching a video and you get an email notification,  it tells you who sent it with a small pop up and you can click on it to check on it...when you are done, all you do is press the back button and you are back to the video...no need to reload the app like the ipad does all the time.\nAlmost all the android apps for phones work on the xoom even though there are only 67 apps designed for android honeycomb. And the apps work great.\nOn the negative side, the xoom is heavier than the ipad..using it as a handheld gaming device can be tiresome...that's why I bought their case/stand which is quite useful (much better than the ipad magnetic cover.\nThe other negative is HD video. The HD video you shot with the xoom looks great, but HD video has to be ripped using the basic profile at a lower bit rate or else it will be choppy.otherwise, SD contents play just fine.\nHDMI cable has to be bought separately, but that is a great feature...looks beautiful on my led TV. Unlike the ipad which requires the apple TV to see shows on your TV, this works right out of a box.\nI have been using it everyday for several hours a day and I like it a lot. I don't understand why this is not selling well. It is a much better product than the ipad2. As soon as people realize how good this is and more tablet apps are available, android tablets will dominate like they do with the smart phones market."}

The new user interface is very good, maybe not as good as the iPad but it's still great and you can put widgets on the home screens and I'd be annoyed if I couldn't, all that screen space. The sound quality is alight, not bad but nothing spectacular, if it bothers you, use head phones. The graphics are impressive, I've become addicted to a 3D flight sym game on it and even my 10 year old nephew who's permanently playing games though the graphics were impressive. The interface is fast, plenty of storage but I still want the upgrade to get the SD reader going, found an app for everything I need although some of them need to be updated for tablet sized screens but I'm sure this will come with time. I also have the portfolio case, does a great job of protecting it but it's very chunky and annoyingly covers the power plug, unfortunately there isn't the huge selection of accessories you get with the iPad. I don't regret my purchase at all and I'm already using it everyday even if it is to read the news in bed, look things up when I'm on the sofa and play games."}

There are not too many apps that take advantage of the honeycomb os, but everyday there more and more apps released.  Oh yeah, the xoom's multitasking is great."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "This is my second tablet PC. My first is Viewsonic G Tablet. The Motorola Xoom is my second tablet PC. It's very awesome. It works very well. The quality of monitor and sound are pretty impressive. The design is look cool. The quality of material is nice; soft texture plastic and aluminum. The back camera works very good. The picture quality is really fantastic. But the front camera is just acceptable.\n\nThe performance is stunning. It's fast and smooth when you slide. It also work great with multi-tasking. This tablet also compatible with many apps from Android Market Apps. Most of importance, you do not need to worry about Flash. This product is support Flash Player. One comment that I have is this tablet cannot change keyboard language into Thai Language. This makes me feel quite disappointed. If anyone knows how to install Thai Keyboard on this Xoom, please kind let me know.\n\nI would recommend this product to anyone who want a fast and high performance tablet PC."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "For a tablet this is a great product.  Apps designed specifically for this operating system work great.  Be wary of purchasing apps that don't specifcally say they work on the tablet version.  Many simply won't work, others don't optimize for the larger screen.  At this review android marketplace only lists 67 tablet apps.  My HUGE dissapointment with Amazon is that their app store doesn't give you any indication of which apps are good for the Xoom.  More importantly, if you are looking to download movies, don't bother for now.  I cannot find any service, Amazon, Netflix or Blockbuster that lets you download to memory and watch later.  Streaming is okay through Amazon, but this is worthless on a plane.  I look forward to someone finally supporing this function.  They will definitely have my business.  Overall it is a great product, but this is new tech and so you will have to wait for the apps and third party support to catch up."}

Apps will crash on me left and right because still only handful of apps are optimized for tablet experience. Not xoom's fault but from consumer viewpoint they will blame device.\n2. No netflix for you!!! Not compatible.\n3. Google chat is the only way to have video chat where u can use front/back camera. Skype is not optimized.\n4. Heavy......if you in portrait mode, you will feel tablet going down on your laps. Also in landscape mode good luck trying to hold with one hand while you write.\n5. Chrome browser pulls mobile version of pages by default. No way to change until you wish to hack every single time you use browser or root your gadget. Not acceptable.\n6. Touch screen not that good either. I found myself struggling to zoom-in on an article in browser.\n7. One can download flash but I would recommend not to as it makes matters worse. Page loading take ages.\n\nI would say neither android nor current hardware are ready for prime time."}

Chrome browser and the open android platform. There is no need to root the device. You can find apps all over the internet and install them through the computer USB connection and or mini SD card.\n\nThe part that I did not like was the software bugs within the device. The video camera hesitates when shooting video. The pictures seem abit out of focus. The operating system seems slow, no folders for apps, no device search, android apps from the droid phones do not run well on the device, no 2X feature like Ipad, no Netflix which works, and no video Skype.\n\nI'm sure many of the bugs will be addressed by Google and or Motorola but I can not wait this time around. I'm selling my Xoom so I can buy an IPAD 2."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "First, I hate to admit that I was a iSheep and was worshiping Apple products (iphone, ipad) for three years.\nNot anymore.\nI am completely blown off by the Honeycomb + Motorola tablet GUI which provides me with the level of customization that could not be achieved in iPad even with all the help from Cydia or any winterboard.\nI am completely blown off by the DLNA support that this tablet offers. I could easily transfer all the transfer videos,mp3 directly to this device via uPNP client(DNLA service). I have tonnes of movies in different formats lying in my hard disk connected to desktop shared via dlna and could be easily accessed by Motorola Xoom and it plays every known video format known. I could read every possible known ebook format in Motorola Xoom.\nI am completely blown off by the quality of Android apps available in the Market and they are comparable and in par with the apps from iTunes. Can you imagine installing Antivirus software in a tablet that scans each and every emails and apps for any potential virus or trojan horse? You can do it in this tablet. Can you imagine running easily 20 to 30 apps in the back ground and still not compromise on the cpu? You can do it here. All the networking apps (vnc, logmein,ssh,....) are available in Android world. The widgets are cool and the level of customization that you can do with these is really great. I am sure that the Android app store will overtake apple app store in a year or two. I think people, who are sick and tired of looking at Apple same old GUI again and again, should start looking at Honeycomb and appreciate the effort that has gone into this.\nOf course, we easily saw tonnes of bugs in iPad in the early days, but the look and feel of it made us mesmerized and forget all those issues.\nBut, when it comes to Honeycomb, it really makes me laugh after reading the silly reviews that these people post in Amazon.com about the reason why they did not like Motorola Xoom and I really feel sorry these people who don't realize the level of customization, tweaks,... that could be done in this device.\nAfter rooting it, I could do a lots of things, like connecting a USB hard disk, Super user rights, side loading, install non android apps, ap*****et, titanium back ups, skype with video,..and the list goes on and on...(I cannot reveal more than this...Join xda-developers for more info...)\n\nHats off to Motorola for making this one of a kind tablet and good luck to all the iSheep's who are still out there reading this review."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "When we see reviews by so called \"Professionals\" of the iPad 2 vs the XOOM they're always heavily slanted towards the iPad 2 and almost completely ignore or downplay the XOOM obvious advantages.  Let me just say, I have the privilege of using both the XOOM and the iPad 2 as I have the XOOM and my wife has the iPad 2 (She likes her iPad but she always asks me, Do I want a XOOM?) so this will be fair and unbiased breaking down the pros and cons of each device.\n\nHARDWARE:\n\nFirst, let me say the only thing I won't include in the Hardware section is the Screen as I will cover that later one and I will compare Apples to well Xooms here (meaning I will compare the same storage configuration, or as close as possible).\n\nThe XOOM comes with 32 Gigs of Internal Storage, an *SD Card Slot for added storage (up to 32 Gigs), a 2 MP Front Facing Camera and a 5 MP Rear facing camera with both being capable of recording 720P Video, it Features a Built-in Micro USB slot, a Built-in HDMI Slot, GPS, Bluetooth Radio, Accelerometer, Barometer, G-Sensor, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor, Stereo Speakers, Headphone Jack, Dual Core Snapdragon 1 GHz CPU, 8 Core Fully Programmable GPU and 1 Gig of RAM as well as Wireless G/N Networking and a Proprietary Charging connector.\n\nThe Apple iPad 2 comes with 32 Gigs of Internal Storage, a .3 MP Front Facing Camera and .9 MP Rear Facing Camera (the rear is capable of 720P but the front is only VGA), Accelerometer, G-Sensor,  Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor, Apple Proprietary Connector, Headphone Jack and 512 Megs of RAM, Mono, Speakers, Apple Dual Core *800 MHz A5 CPU with a PowerVR 843 GPU and Wireless G/N Networking as Well as a *Bluetooth Connector.\n\nAs you can see, the features missing in the iPad 2 are SD Card Slot, Built-In HDMI and USB Slots, GPS and a Barometer so Apple has no showing in these areas but you can buy the HDMI Dongle and SD CARD Dongle (for reading pictures not for Storage) to the tune of $39 each plus tax so you can instantly see the savings that XOOM is offering just with the missing features.\n\nNow, what is inferior in the iPad 2, .3 MP Front Facing Camera (the XOOM's is HD) and only a .9 MP (drops to .7 MP for pictures which is really sad) rear facing camera (the XOOM's is 5 MP), 512 Megs of RAM for the iPad 2 (that's it, no iPad has more and the XOOM is at 1 Gig of RAM), Mono Speakers on the iPad compared to the Stereo Speakers on the XOOM, Apple Clocked their Dual Core A5 at 800 MHz to save battery but advertised the device as being 1 GHz (it is a 1 GHz CPU so they're not lying but the default clock speed is 800 MHz) and Apple won't specify the number of Cores in their GPU either (this particular model of GPU comes in 2, 4 and 8 cores).\n\nAs you can clearly see, the internal hardware is clearly in favor of the XOOM as what it is capable of is just far and away more than the iPad 2.\n\nLCD DISPLAYS:\n\n  In testing these side by side, there are 5 areas where I compared the LCD's...\n\nFirst, Viewing Angle, the iPad has a 170 Degree Viewing Angle and the XOOM is closer to 130 Degrees (to some this is a big deal but to me, I only use my XOOM looking straight on) so the iPad 2 is clearly superior in viewing angles.\n\nBlack Level is another area that the iPad 2 seems to have an advantage (at least in terms of viewing pictures, Movies seem much more even so it might be software).\n\nSaturation is a Draw to me because the Apple is over saturated and the XOOM under Saturated (neither is bad, both are very usable).\n\nResolution, Apple measures in at 1024x768 with 130 ppi where as the XOOM Measures in at 1280x800 with 160 ppi so you can clearly see the XOOM has a higher resolution and it is in fact the only display of the two capable of playing true 1280x720 HD Video so that's a big advantage.\n\nBrightness, the XOOM at every level I compared was brighter than the iPad display and this is okay but it often made the iPad 2 look Muddy when comparing the two side by side even though it looked perfectly sharp on its own.  In short, I have to give this one to the XOOM.\n\nHonestly, this is in line with what others have said, the iPad 2 colors have more pop and a better viewing angle where as the XOOM colors seem more natural (maybe a little sedated) and the Screen is Brighter with higher Resolution so it is basically a Draw because both have their advantages.\n\nOPERATING SYSTEMS:\n\n  You have two very different animals here and there really is no middle ground...  Either you like overly simplified or you like lots of control and that is really the main point.\n\nThe XOOM was the first Tablet Running Google's Android Honeycomb and it takes a lot of it's design from WebOS (with Good Reason, they hired the designer of WebOS to develop the User Interface for Honeycomb and this is a good thing because I know a lot of Apple Fans that Praise WebOS).  Of course this version of Android has the Settings Area, the App Draw and the Desktops that you're used to...  What it adds is a unified User Interface Customization Area, a Frequently Run Apps Button and a much more organized Unified Notification Area (think Windows Taskbar or the WebOS Taskbar).  This version of Android is very well laid out and very powerful, it is overall very smooth and has a nice polished look to it.\n\nThe iPad 2 is running iOS 4.3 and features the typical Desktops where all your apps are stored, the Settings Area and the Running Apps Panel...  That's it, there's very little customization to the look of the OS and really, it is a very basic Operating System from this perspective.\n\nTo Me, the Android Honeycomb Platform has the best of the Desktop and Smartphone Worlds all rolled into one where as most people that like iOS 4 love the simplistic nature of the design.  Honestly, this is such a personal choice I'm really going to call this a Draw as both have their strengths and weaknesses but ultimately it is going to come down to what you like and that's it.\n\nAPPLICATIONS:\n\nApple's iPad 2 has the benefit of being a 2nd Generation Tablet and thus in the last year it has gotten 65,000 Tablet Optimized Apps...  Yes it started with very little but right now it has plenty.  The downside is that the iPhone / iPod Apps don't upscale very well and that creates a pretty horrible looking Application when you have to scale it.\n\nGoogle's Android Honeycomb is obviously a 1st Generation Tablet and the drawback is that you don't have a years worth of Tablet Optimized Apps.  The Upside is that Android Phones have been predominantly higher resolution since and ever since Android 2.x they've scaled dynamically so most of the Android Phone Apps Scale very well and don't give you that pixelated look that the iPhone apps have on the iPad.  I know some argue this doesn't really count because it doesn't look like the other Tablet Apps but it practically makes the 65k App Advantage less Daunting.\n\nI will give this one to the iPad 2 with the note that the advantage is only in the appearance of \"Tablet Optimized Apps\" as there really is no shortage of Apps that run and run well on Honeycomb.\n\nWEB BROWSING:\n\nApple's iPad 2 relies heavily on HTML 5 for Video and often have sites tailored just for their device...  This isn't a perfect solution but it does work well until you run into something that requires Flash Player to view properly (yes this happens more than most iPad fans are willing to admit).  Not this does not support true Tabbed Browsing in that you have to push a button that brings you into miniature versions of the pages already open.\n\nHoneycomb features a version of the highly acclaimed Chrome Browser and it features true Tabbed Browsing, HTML 5 Support and Support for FLash Player.  For the most part, Desktop versions of Websites just work on Honeycomb and even Youtube is the real deal through the browser.\n\nBATTERY LIFE:\n\nApple's iPad 2 has pretty much the same size battery as the iPad 1 and the XOOM but they've made some *optimizations (or cut corners) that the XOOM did not take and this gave them over 10 Hours of Battery Life.  This battery takes roughly 4 Hours and 35 Minutes to Charge completely so you get 10 Hours of use for every 4.35 hours of Charging.\n\nXOOM Gives you pretty much straight up support and implements everything exactly as they say they have so their battery life is roughly 9 Hours.  The XOOM Proprietary Charger actually Charges the Battery in 2 Hours and 20 Minutes so you get roughly 9 hours of use for every 2.2 Hours of charging.\n\nI don't know about you but 18 hours of use for the same amount of charging time that the iPad 2 gets 10 hours of use makes the XOOM the Clear winner to me!\n\nMISC:\n\nBasically, I couldn't figure out where to put these so I put them here...\n\nThe Bluetooth in the XOOM is much better than the Bluetooth in the iPad 2 as it allows for a much larger group of compatible hardware... I literally connect my Wiimote and Classic Controller Pro to my XOOM so I can use it to play games with the classic Console Emulators (Genesis, N64, SNES, NES, TG16, MAME, Sega Master System and Atari, with Sony adding PS One and PS2 Support later) which really doesn't matter on the Apple because they will never allow you to run the Emulators on their iPad 2 anyway.\n\nAlso, there's no CISCO VPN Client for Honeycomb if you don't root the device and use OPEN VPN so this limits the tablets use in some business environments as this does exist for iOS.\n\nNOTES FROM ABOVE:\n\n*SD Card Support for the XOOM will not be implemented until some time in May.\n*Apple purposely under-clocked their CPU by 200 MHz to save battery life as they're using the same Battery with a more power hungry CPU.\n*Apple also Implemented App Backgrounding as opposed to real multitasking (with the exception of Apple Apps) as this was also to save Battery Life and Android leaves it up to the developer to use Multitasking or to use just use App Backgrounding."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I still use my iPad 1 but the Xoom has become my main tablet now about about 2 weeks of use.\n\nIn a way it's like when I moved over from the iPhone to the Nexus One last year and felt liberated by the OS; never looking back (my wife still has her iPhone so use it once awhile). Got the same experience this time around also.\n\nWith the screen real estate of a tablet, the ability to run widgets IMO is the \"killer feature\" and the Xoom does this with pinache.  To see my calendar, recent E-mails, top news stories, and Twitter items all on my main screen is just pure awesome :-).  No way I'm going back to anything else that cannot do this.  This is not even mentioning access to a real file system, standard USB connection, freedom from iTunes, no-compromise multitasking, SD card slot (when Motorola releases upgrade; I can confirm that it works already if you're willing to root the device with custom kernel)...\n\nMy only complaint at this point - the power button at the back!  Would have preferred a more standard placement like the top or sides.  Not deal breaker but minor annoyance.\n\nBottom line: this thing feels like what I envisioned a tablet computer should be; the kind of machine with the feel of something between your laptop and cell phone, putting into question in my mind the viability of netbooks.  This will only get better as Honeycomb matures and bugs worked out (quite stable already, I think Apple is quite sneaky in that when a program \"force closes\" the user is not informed. I certainly ran into many of those situations on the iPad.)\n\nGrade: 4.5/5"}

Use it heavily at work just for file transfers and working off-line\n\nAm disappointed that I still can not find an HD movie player (a high reason I selected this tablet over the iPad2), and that so many of the non tablet (only 67 tablet applications available at the time I wrote this) all crash (like Facebook) on the XOOM.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Let me start by saying this is my very first android device and I am no expert of android. So much has already been written about the xoom already that I don't know what value my review will add. I have used the product for about 2 weeks now and am fairly comfortable about writing this review for the benefit of people still on the fence about buying one or not, so here are my 2 cents worth.\n\nThings I like :\n1) The notifications. This thing is amazing, it just sits in the background and does not interfere with the task you are doing.\n2) The speed. Breathtakingly fast at installing/uninstalling apps. Also the apps and games like fruit ninja, file explorer, ezpdf reader, kindle, google sky map, google maps/earth, angry birds (amazing game play), moboplayer, quickoffice, skype, SBM etc etc are blazingly fast and all have worked so far without a single forced close.\n3) The browser is fast. Rarely it does hang a bit, but it does provide a near desktop surfing experience. Flash works and it works well.\n4) Skype though not yet available in video yet is perfect for voice calls. I have used it extensively and it just sits there in the notification ready to receive/make calls and does not use up too much of memory. Voice clarity seems same/better than my desktop version.\n5) Market works well with plenty of apps to download and enjoy. I suggest do your research on a particular app via googling it first before downloading on your tablet. This works well for me.\n6) GPS is accurate and works even when I am indoors. I tether my tablet via wifi to my mobile phone and can use this as an excellent navigation tool.\n7) I love google sky map. I never used it on my desktop but decided to install it on the tablet just for fun. Glad I did. It seems google designed sky map just for tablets. It uses the gps and accelerometer to perfection to provide excellent basic info of the sky for anyone interested.\n8) The rear camera is fairly good and is a very useful tool as a document scanner and barcode scanner.\n9) Gmail and Gtalk work flawless and they are almost integrated into the system.\n10) The tablet form factor is good and it feels great in your hands. Use a good silicone cover to prevent smudge marks of your finger on the back side cover.\n11) Screen. This was the bit I was most apprehensive about before purchasing the tablet. It is not as good as the ipad 2 screen but it is higher resolution and brightness can be adjust to suit your comfort. The screen is especially brilliant for reading text even small text. The glass does indeed attract fingerprints a lot but daily wiping with a screen cleaning fluid takes care of this. I am not using a screen protector as installing one is a hassle. The glass appears to be scratch resistant but this I will find out only after prolonged usage. Overall though the screen is good.\n12) The ability to add widgets like mail, favourites, news feeds, time etc and app shortcuts on the desktop (there are 5 of them) is an invaluable time saver.\n13) No need to root it.\n14) Battery life is pretty good and I can go through an entire day with extensive use without recharging.\n15) Wifi connectivity is pretty good and wherever my laptop gets a signal so does my xoom. Speed of surfing is good even when it is showing 1 bar signal strength.\n16) True multitasking.\n\nThings I hate :\n1) Video playback. I have tried players like the stock player, moboPlayer, Vplayer, QQPlayer, mVideoPlayer etc and all have a problem playing the non supported formats. This tablet fits into the ipad category when it comes to video playback. Specific baseline HD video plays back flawlessly, however most other video content does not play smoothly. This is most evident with panning shots. They look horrible. The formats that motorola says are supported play very well. Non-HD content which is not supported also has this stuttering problem. Non supported HD content plays like a presentation in frames. It is said this is a hardware issue and nvidia tegra 2 only supports baseline hd. If this is the case then this is a problem that will remain with this version of xoom forever. I am of the opinion if this is the case at least non-hd content should play flawlessly, and since it does not I have a feeling its more of an android issue rather than nvidia. Future updates of android and its video playback apps should take care of, if not the high profile HD, at least the regular non HD avi, mkv files. Anyone who wants to use the xoom primarily for video playback should avoid the xoom and other to be released android tablets like the toshiba tablet like a plague till this issue gets sorted out.\n2) Some apps like the VPlayer force close so frequently they are unusable. I was looking forward to play Asphalt on my tablet but sadly it does not work yet. Surprising cause the xoom is out for 2 months now. Quite a few apps are not optimized for the android 3.0 platform and will not run or force close frequently. Some apps do run flawlessly but only in small phone sized 4' screens so that you find them annoyingly small and will uninstall them immediately. This problem should however disappear over time.\n3) The video playback issue caused even googles own youtube app to crash the tablet sometimes when you try to play HD youtube content. 1 out of 10 times the app says can't play the youtube content. However on shutting the app and trying to play the same hd youtube video will work flawlessly the next time. Once the same youtube app has caused my Xoom to restart all by itself. See what I mean by the android platform needing more work while playing back video. It is not yet optimized for it.\n4) I haven't yet got google voice to work accurately for me. Maybe its my accent but more than half the time it gets what I say wrong. However what I do like is that voice is ingrained into the tablet almost as if its an integral part of it. With some work on my part I hope to extensively use this feature. Updates from google will make it much more accurate in the future too I hope.\n5) SD card yet to be enabled (for non rooted xoom) but I hope for an enabling update soon.\n\nOverall I conclude that irrespective of all the flaws the pluses outweigh the negatives massively for me. Think about what you will primarily use your tablet for and make up your own minds. All I can say is that if you want to use this tablet for anything other than watching video, take the plunge and buy it. You will definitely be amazed with its capability.\n\nUpdate (14 May 2011):\nYesterday google released the much anticipated android 3.1 update. Just as I expected I see a massive improvement in the video playback performance. A SD (non-HD) video that was playing stutteringly prior to the update now plays back flawlessly. Also with adobe flash update there is marked improvement in video playback stability. Youtube has still forced closed on me quite a few times while playing back HD content but it feels much better now than earlier and flash is much faster in streaming media from sites like bbc, comedy central etc and very stable. Also voice is much much more accurate and I get 85% correct translations without me having to change my accent much. This could improve further which I am sure it will. The app force close issues have also markedly gone down, but this is due to the fact that the apps are slowly optimizing for tablets and android 3 in general. I have also been able to seamlessly connect to my desktop pc via rdp using an ad free and totally free app called 2X and remote control my desktop from there (will try to upload a video). Network file sharing is a breeze with ES file explorer another free app. So network connectivity wise this tablet performs optimally. SD card has yet to be enabled so that is still a bit of an issue. However, usb host mode has now been enabled on xoom with the 3.1 update (a rooted xoom had this feature since march) but I have yet to try this out as I don't have an OTG cable yet. But I think flash drives and cameras should load up on the xoom, a big plus."}

While the iPad does have app switching, it's slow and clumsy. The Xoom's multitasking is so well implemented, that instead of feeling like you're using a giant smartphone, you actually feel like you're using a computer. Combine this with the Xoom's fantastic notification system, and this thing is a beast. Get an email? A little speech bubble will pop up on the bottom right, with a picture of the person that sent the email and the subject. However, you can simply go about your business or quickly swap into the email app, reply, and thanks to the multitasking, effortlessly go back to what you were doing.\n\niOS has never had flash, and on the phone, that doesn't really matter much. However, on a tablet, this is a serious problem. Being able to watch flash video and interact with flash content makes the Xoom more of a computer than a giant smartphone. While I used to be okay with the iPad not having flash, I definitely can't go back now. While the Xoom does not have Hulu or Netflix right now, the ability to watch flash videos makes up for this, since you can watch your favorite TV shows or movies on a lot of different websites.\n\nA lot of reviews say Honeycomb feels \"incomplete\" or \"rushed.\" This is simply not true. It is an incredibly well put-together OS that takes tablet computing to the next level. My only complaint is that the browser crashes too much for my liking. You'll also hear that the apps for Honeycomb are lacking. This is true. However, the old Android apps run surprisingly well on the Xoom. When the iPad runs an iPhone app, it simple zooms in, and the result is an awful image and an app that looks ridiculous. On the Xoom, it actually runs the app on the higher resolution, and while some apps have too much white space on the Xoom, some actually look like they were made for the Xoom. Regardless, there are already a lot of great Honeycomb-optimized apps.\n\nAs far as hardware is concerned, the build quality is fantastic. The thing feels very solid and durable. The battery does last about an hour less than the iPad, but this definitely lasts a full day of work. However, the screen's viewing angles are not that great, which usually doesn't matter too much. However, if it is lying on a table and you are typing on it, the colors get a little washed out. Additionally, the screen doesn't get as bright as I would like it. The iPad performs a little better outside in the sun. However, both are pretty awful to use outside. The nice thing about the screen is the resolution: the pixel density is fantastic and makes the detail on everything great. The screen resolution is much wider than the iPad, making it feel just a little awkward when you hold it portrait. I usually used the iPad portrait, because landscape felt odd to me, unless I was watching something. Well, the Xoom is the opposite.\n\nMy number one complaint with the Xoom is the weight. It's too heavy and the weight is distributed unevenly. The top of the device is heavier than the bottom. After holding the device for awhile, your wrists will get tired. Even though the iPad 2 is lighter, the iPad 2 is also a little too heavy.\n\nNow, comparing it to the new Android tablets coming out...\n\nThis is smaller than the ASUS Transformer, and the Xoom's screen performs better outdoors. However, the ASUS one is a lot cheaper, the screen has better viewing angles and colors (It's an IPS, like the iPad), lighter, and has the very cool keyboard dock. The only problem is that since it is running customized Honeycomb software, it might receive updates really late/delayed. The built quality also isn't as good as the Xoom; while the Xoom is made of metal, the ASUS is plasatiic. There's also the LG Slate and new Samsung Galaxy Tab coming out. Simply put, don't bother with the LG Slate. The new Samsung Galaxy, on the other hand, is incredibly light and thinner than the iPad 2. Unfortunately, I don't know much about the screen, but Samsung usually doesn't go cheap on displays.\n\nWhen it comes to the new Honeycomb tablets, there's no losing. These are incredible, and I would suggest people get them instead of the iPad 2. It's simply a better experience and a more clever operating system. If I were to buy one now, I'd probably get the Transformer. The more competitive price is really amazing. If I were to wait a little, I'd get the new Samsung Galaxy Tab."}

I just couldn't get locked into Apple's proprietary world.\n\nI don't regret the purchase at all.  I recommend the Xoom if you are in the market for a tablet.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "First let me explain why I automatically deducted a full star from this review.\n\nMy Motorola Drioid X's 16 GB Micro SD card died after 6 months of use.  I contacted Verizon Wireless to request for a free replacement since it has 1 year warranty.  Verizon Wireless directed me to Motorola since Motorola is the manufacturer of this device.  So I called Motorola.  I was shocked to hear that Motorola told me the best replacement they could send me is 4GB Micro SD card.  I told them my Driod X came with 16GB Micro SD card and that I am entitle to get at least equal value replacement.  They refused and insist the best they could do is to send me a 4GB card.  I politely told Motorola no thanks and called Verizon back to let them know Motorola refused to honor the warranty.  Verizon made it right, they told me buy a 16 GB card from their store and will reimburse me for it.  I faxed the receipt to Verizon and they deducted the amount from my phone bill within 2 business days.  I was happy with Verizon's service but shame on Motorola.  I therefore from now on will automatically deduct 1 full star on any Motorola product reviews in anticipation that I might run into warranty issues again in the future.  Because Motorola did not honor the warranty I'm entitled to, they have lost me as a loyal customer.  I will still buy Motorola products provided I have no other choice.  But I prefer to stay away from it whenever possible.\n\nMy 6 year old son used to play with his Aunt's iPad on weekends.  He loved it.  After a few days with the Xoom, I was surprised that he liked the Xoom more.  The weight didn't bother him a bit.  He now wakes up extra early in the morning just to play Club Penguin on the Xoom.  Thanks to the Xoom's ability to run Flash, he could play Club Penguin and other popular Flash games.  The iPad simply could not let him do that.  Of course, besides Flash games, he loves native apps like Angry Birds, Farm Frenzy, and few others.\n\nThe wife loves the Xoom too.  When she is using it, the son has to yield.  The son is actually happy too because he is the new owner his mom's laptop. That's right, the wife no longer wants her laptop.  She used to occupy the TV during each evening.  No longer!  She is now too busy with her Xoom.  And I actually get to watch baseball in the evening!!\n\nThe build is top quality.  Feels solid but not too heavy.  I know the wife and son will eventually drop it, so I placed the \"Smoke Argyle Silicone Skin Cover\" on it.  Even after the silicone skin is on it, the Xoom still don't feel bulky.  It is just about right.\n\nHoneycomb OS is intuitive.  My non-technical wife figured it all out herself.  Even my 6 year old is pretty good at using it.  The only thing I did for them was the wifi setup and Bluetooth tethering.  It was easy as cake.\n\nThe Xoom is actually helping the wife to keep fit.  She watches YouTube while on the treadmill.  Because she enjoys it, she runs more frequently and for longer duration.\n\nBattery life is pretty good.  We set the screen brightness to auto.  Even under heavy use, we charge every other day.\n\nThe screen resolution is good, but color does not pop.  I expected more vivid colors, but so far no complaints from the wife, so I guess it is acceptable.\n\nThe Micro SD card slot does not work yet.  Motorola better provide an update to fix this soon as competitors are rolling out more similar featured Honeycomb tablets which comes with Micro SD card slot working.\n\nThere are not many native Honeycomb tablet apps yet.  But I know the numbers are growing daily.  I myself is working on a native Honeycomb tablet app to be release in a month or 2.  And I do have plans to develop more apps for this platform.\n\nI am in the market to buy 3 more Honeycomb tablets within a month.  Although I have no regret buying the Motorola Xoom, I am open to consider other Honeycomb tablets that are rolling out.  The Asus Transformer tablet look very attractive to me.  I'll order 1 from Amazon as soon as it is available.  And if I like it, I'll order 2 more."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I received an iPad for Christmas from my wife and decided to return it for a few reasons. The first is that rumors had already started about the iPad2 coming out and I didn't want to get the first iPad 2 months before the new one came out. I also didn't really want to need to buy a whole new set of apps for iPad since I already have an Evo Android phone. I had also been reading a lot about all of the new Android tablets that would be coming out this year. So, for all those reasons, I decided to wait.\n\nThe Xoom came out and the biggest initial issue that I had with it was the astonomical price for the Verizon version. I knew that there was no way I was getting that. Then rumors of a Wi-Fi only version started to surface. The price still sounded higher than I would have liked, but it did look like a really good piece of hardware. That is the entire basis of my review, great hardware that is at least $100 more than it should be. If Android hopes to make any headway against the iPad, it needs to be cheaper.\n\nThe new Honeycomb Android OS for tablets is good, but not yet great. It is definitely functional at this point, but I can see that it needs a bit to go. I won't really dock the Xoom points for that since I know that the OS will be continually updated and that it is not really a Motorola issue. As it stands, it is pretty good. The biggest issues right now are the lack of tablet ready apps (which will also change soon enough) and the force closes (crashes) that happen a bit to often right now (again, I am sure this will be fixed quickly).\n\nSo, to sum up, really nice hardware that runs fast and smooth, a pretty good OS that does need a few things fixed, but is pretty good, but still a bit too expensive. A tablet is in no way a necessity, so it needs to not be more expensive than a laptop that is far more functional."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "If you are in the market for a tablet you should seriously consider the xoom. It is faster and packed with more features compared to the ipad. Don't waste your money on apple's shiny piece of plastic. The xoom is faster,larger screen, gorilla glass(scratch resistant) , chrome browser is fast and you can open tabs and also browse in incognito mode(aka private browsing) , tons of free apps in the Android market.\n\nSet up is a breeze, just sign in with your gmail account. All your contacts, email, calendar automatically sync once you sign in. You need to use a credit card only if you make any purchase on Android market.  You will get all the Google goodness. To improve performance turn off animations. Settings->display ->animations. The only difference between ipad and the xoom is,the xoom cannot play Netflix. Netflix does not have an app for Android yet because of DRM. I don't care much for Netflix because I use Amazon instant video which plays flawlessly on the xoom. The Xoom more than makes up for the lack of Netflix by supporting flash. There are a ton of flash based videos and games that I would prefer to watch, but ipad does not (and will not) support flash. So, I will pick the ability to play flash over ablity to play Netflix.\n\nupdate: Facebook app force closes all the time. This is not Andriod Honeycomb or Xoom problem I think the Facebook app is not optimized for tablets. There are a handful of apps that are really optimized for the tablet. This is where Ipads win over Andriod. If Google wants Andriod to be successful they need to force app developers to optimize their apps for the right device. I am probably more patient and forgiving compared to other consumers.\n\nThis review was written on my xoom!"}

It is alright, but the colors on the screen become washed out if you hold the unit at an angle.  The unit will become somewhat hot on your lap while using it too.  This must be likely to the processing power of the device?  In short, I took the unit back and purchased an IPad 2.  The IPad screen is much brighter and the viewing angles are better.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I doubt if my review is read as it's more likely to get lost in 100s of reviews. So, I'd rather keep it simple :-).\n\nInitially, I didn't like honeycomb/Xoom at least for couple of days because of the following reasons:\n\n - No hardware hence wasting bottom part of screen for displaying the bottons\n - apps drawer located on top and hard to reach without taking your hand off the side of the table\n - touch screen keyboard is hard to use ergonomically while holding the tablet\n - little on the heavier side to hold it and still use keyboard\n\nOnce, I got the feel of honeycomb and tablet, I find OS is very well designed for tablets. Widgets make Android all the more productive compared to iOS as I can see my emails, calendars, facebook updates, etc all on one screen and always in sync. GoogleTalk with video chat is awesome as most of my friends use it with their laptops that have webcam.\n\nOver the next few weeks I can make it even better with some of my favorite android apps like LauncherPro, Beautiful Weather, etc. Currently, I am trying Thumb Keyboard and I like how the layout is designed to be used by thumbs. Perfect for tablets. Only downside is, it takes up most part of the screen and only text boxes get displayed when you enter text.\n\nPros:\n - Extremely top notch build quality\n - Beautiful screen\n - Specs are good to keep it going for couple of years\n\nCons:\n - Heavy (Should have gone for cabon fiber metal like Sony Vaio Z series laptops)\n - Screen would have been put to great use if the standard 4 android hardware keys were present"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have had my Xoom now for about a month and I have found that it really streamlines much of my daily tech activities.  Things like checking my email or browsing here on Amazon used to require me hunkering down in front of the desktop or laptop and then I'd spend half the night there.  Now I can sit back. In my comfy chair and enjoy the company of my family, even if I am still browsing the net.  Battery life is phenominal, it has never run out on me in a single day of even my heaviest usage.  Its fast, and instantly on from its sleep function.  I would however list two or three must haves if you plan on owning this device.  First, the Motorola case, it is the best option of any of the cases I've seen. Second, a note taking app like everynote or if you use it for work like I do Quickoffice is awesome and is compatible with Microsoft office for the most part. Last, Thumbboard is an absolute must.  Itsplits the keyboard. Into two half keyboards spaced for your thumbs so you don't have to set the thing down everytime you want to type.  It does take a minute to set it up to your individual liking but totally worth it.  It has increased my typing speed significantly.  So much that I am even writing this review from my Xoom.  In closing, if you spend a lot of your time at work and home in front of a screen,  this device can be a freeing and enjoyable alternative.  Like me, you might find that the unthinkable may happen. A week willl pass by and you will notice that you haven't turned on your home computer."}

I thought for sure i'd hate the thing, but after a little time using it, i must say it's just so much better than a laptop or desktop. there's just something about that touchscreen that makes the xoom soo much fun to use. I'm still figuring out how to use honeycomb. it's a bit much for those who aren't tech savvy, so the ipad might have it beat on that front.\n  My biggest complaint is that the apps that motorola and google were showing off at trade shows are either not there or missing or somewhere in between. there's a problem with the youtube app not being installed on many of the xooms out of the box. mine included. still trying to fix this bug. I don't appreciate the fact that neither google nor motorola is helping to remedy the situation. the skype app that was being shown at several trade shows isn't there either. you can find one on the app store but it can't do video. not sure where the skype app that you can watch on youtube for the xoom went to, but i'm a bit angry that it's not there.\n  The apps that are included are awesome. Google's services are much better on a tablet than on a pc. voice, translate, and maps are awesome. google body is a blast.

I like the size and how smooth it is when you change from display normal, longways and also upside down.  Granted it doesn't have nearly all the software that an iPad does but I'm sure it will catch up soon.  I've had an iTouch for about 2 years now and it took me about a week to get used to how to get around and the differences but now I'm loving it.  The camera and video is pretty impressive.  I will say that some of the apps in the market are geared for phones not a tablet so most cases I was uninstalling the ones that failed.  The one thing that is nice is that it will run flash player.  I heard they are coming out with more Wifi models the fact that I'll be able to use an SD card at some point is very nice.  I'm hoping sooner than later on that.  I haven't gotten a cable yet to do an HDMI connection to my TV.  I'd love to see how that works.  I've had it for about 2 and half weeks and I'm very happy.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I was thinking of giving it a 5 star rating but the price on it for most users might be a bit higher than what they would want to spend.

I bought an iPad 1 on release for resale on eBay for one unit and to keep the other (thus it was free considering markups at the time).  So much of this review will discuss the differences and comparison to the iPad 1.  I'm sure many Apple fans will say that some of my comparisons might be unfair considering the iPad 2 is out but I have no experience with that device.  In regards to full disclosure I do have an Android smartphone that I am pretty satisfied with, though it does have many areas I think improvements could be made, and I am not at all a fan of iPhones as I think they are far less capable then Android or Blackberry OS for either end of the user segment, but I do find an iPod touch a very capable device even though I no longer own it.  So really I'm not a fanboy of either side.  I am also what one would consider a 'power user' as I have wide experience with devices and like to be in control of their functionality.\n\nTo start ease of app installation.  Honeycomb isn't hard to use by any means.  Installing apps is simple and in my opinion a far better experience then on iOS as you're never forced to leave the Market then re-enter it.  Google shines here and the refund policy on new apps is something all 'App Markets' should follow, that or requiring a limited time free trial for all apps should really be mandatory.  The downside is of course that the amount of Honeycomb specific apps is still pretty slim.  Those that do exist are acceptable and Android as a whole is far better at emulation of non-tablet specific apps then the iPad was when it was initially released, but the fact remains the iPad has been around longer and has the larger market share.  More apps exist for it and it'll be an uphill battle for Google to make up ground in this.  However, the apps that do exist for Android work well and other then some specific games I've had no problems replacing my app functionality though your mileage may vary.\n\nEase of use.  Installation and startup of both devices is easy.  Android makes the process a little nicer if you own another Android device by syncing settings and apps so I'd put a very happy notch for Android there.  However, my Xoom had a seemingly common bug where Youtube wasn't installed but was.  This required some reboots and messing around with APK files annoying and really indicative of a bit of a rushed and rough and tumble release.  As a power user I found the problem easy enough to fix especially with the great amount of community support located on many sites throughout the Internet but still this shouldn't happen.  After this experience and some other similar ones with the Google Books app and just the more intuitive (but less efficient) method iOS uses in operation the iPad wins hands down here.  If you know what you're doing the Xoom and Honeycomb are immensely powerful.  If you're my father or someone who has little to average tech experience and little patience I'd recommend an iPad before using a Xoom you'll have a more rewarding experience in this regard.\n\nOperation/capabilities.  Xoom wins.  Not even a contest.  iPad is a media consumption device and so is the Xoom.  The Xoom though will happily let you open ZIP files, open RAR files, create ZIP files, create RAR files, save whatever data file, manipulate whatever data file, copy data off of it easily with a myriad of options for it, most attractively play Flash files...The list goes on.  The Xoom will let you change your keyboard to whatever.  No more digging through three menu's to get to special key entries that you use all the time on web forums.  It's not even a contest here and I think anyone being honest with themselves will agree.  The Xoom is a far more capable device based on what it allows you to manipulate then the iPad will ever be.  If all you want to do is browse basic web pages and read basic books maybe the iPad is for you.  If you don't want to curse a little to yourself every time you stumble across a ZIP file and be forced to turn on your computer for a basic operation the Xoom is a very attractive option.\n\nHardware.  The Xoom feels like a solid device.  But it is a little heavy.  The heft is noticeable.  The iPad feels a lot lighter in my hands though it too gets tiresome after awhile.  Really wish they'd get the weights of the devices down as this does become a problem with prolonged use.  In regards to build quality both devices feel solid though the Xoom with its near total absence of plastic does feel more solid and expensive.  Still that's purely a asethetic comment.  Otherwise the main differences would be that the Xoom lacks any sort of button for basic Home/Back/Search options while the iPad has its lone Home key.  Honestly I miss the hardware Homekey.  While Honeycomb's software buttons are a lot better than I expected they can and are pressed far more often accidently then the Hardware button on the Xoom could ever possibly be.  Of course you don't have to worry about the button wearing out as my iPad 1's is starting to after a year of heavy usage.  Both devices have of course a volume rocker button in this case the iPad whips the Xoom handedly.  I don't know what Motorola was thinking but the devices volume rocker is awful.  It's responsive when you can find it...but finding it is a problem, unlike the iPad's which is easily reachable.\n\nStability.  Both devices crash especially the browser.  Some people will lie to you and say that crashes never happen on the iPad they're very very wrong.  Crashes happen often on that platform especially in low memory conditions.  Android crashes a lot too but unlike iOS when there is a crash the browser often forgets everything of the page it was on.  I expect they'll be a software fix for that eventually but it is a little annoying now.  Considering the Xoom's capabilities and true multi-tasking the device is slightly less stable but I don't find that to be too much of a downside.  Really neither side wins here.\n\nBooks.  Why are you buying this device? To be an eReader? They suck at that.  Buy yourself a Kindle or Sony reader and you'll have a much nicer experience.  If I had to choose though out of the box the iPad is surperior with iBooks as Google's Book service doesn't allow for sideloading of books.  However, thanks to Android there are many free eBook programs available such as Alkido to make up for this issue.  Overall even really in that they both suck for this application.  Comic books on the other hand thrive on both devices.  Overall have to give the point to Android and the Xoom in this case simply because apps there natively read the CBR/CBZ files for free without the fuss of syncing through iTunes.  Again a software issue that Apple could easily fix...but likely won't.\n\nIn the end both devices are good.  I love the form factor and the battery life of both.  The Xoom though to a power user like myself is the obvious winner it simply does so much more that the iPad, due to the restrictions placed on its software, just can't do.  If though I was buying the device for someone less computer literate and with far less patient I would not buy them a Xoom.  Honeycomb is a bit of a rushed product at points and you can see some of the shortcuts taken.  With Firmware updates and time the Xoom will become a more and more compelling device but it's still a little bit less user friendly then it could be.  Both devices have their markets but right now Apple rightly appeals more to the masses.  As time goes by though and Google develops the software further Honeycomb or whatever version of Android will be out by that stage will likely be eating iOS for Breakfast, but it's time is not yet here."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I've had the Moto Xoom wi-fi tablet since last week, when I picked it up at my local Cost-co. The Cost-co bundle includes a decent case. I also bought a Toshiba 8GB microSD card from my local Office Max, thinking I could use it in the Xoom. Much to my charin and disapointment, I found out the microSD function was not working yet -- and as of today is still not enabled. Adobe Flash, on the other hand, worked out-of-box, but not always.\n\nOverall, the hardware is pretty nice, from the snappy processor to the nice touch display with its 16:10 widescreen aspect ratio to the dual cameras. It's heavy, probably the same weight as the 1st-gen iPad, so my arm and wrist get tired if I hold it for more than 15 minutes.\n\nThe Android 3.0 OS, however, is quite buggy. I've downloaded only 10 apps so far, including the Amazon Appstore app, which, interestingly, is the one that constantly crashes. Just minutes ago, the Amazon Appstore app simply shut down the entire Xoom without warning, just seconds into launching it. Other apps (all of which free but mostly downloaded from the Amazon Appstore), including Google's own, have had frequent force closes (fc's).  Very frustrating.\n\nThe mail app is also frustrating, as it keeps switching between a 3-column view and a 2-column view. The Chrome web browser has trouble with many normal sites (normal in the sense that I've never had trouble having those sites rendered in desktop IE 6 through 9), including the regular Amazon.com. Interesting -- U.S. Dept of Justice should take heed -- the browser has some serious trouble with the Bing homepage. And of course, you cannot use any other search engine as the system-wide default search tool -- another thing the Dept. of Justice should take heed of.\n\nAs all \"professional\" reviewers have opinined, the OS feels like it's still in beta. It's also a little convoluted in its interface. It does offer much more power and flexibilty than the dumbed-down iOS, but in the end, if I want something with power and flexibility *and choices* -- I'm definitely pro-choice when it comes to technology -- I'd stick with my 2-lb. netbook."}

I was never even to gain a connection to my WIFI, despite countless tries, reboots, etc.  For $600, I expect the device to be able to seamlessly hook up to my WIFI- the first try.  I don't think it's too much to ask. And to think, despite reading many accounts and reviews of this device that said it \"felt like it was a beta product\" I took the chance on it anyway.  Right now I wish I hadn't\n\nI was pretty psyched about the product too, since I love my Droid X but I can't overlook something so basic.  This one is going back for a full cash refund, not an exchange.  I may wait a little bit and see how the next wave of Android tablets look."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I bought the wifi version the second it was available on Amazon, but I've been waiting to write my review until I really got used to it.  I was really excited before it came out. I had read all the iPad vs. iPad2 vs. Xoom reviews and wanted the Xoom because of the flash capabilities, the expandable memory, and the flexibility compared to doing everything on iTunes.\nI don't want to give an in-depth review since so many others have already tone that.  I will give my general impressions.  I never really cared about the iPad2 being lighter & thinner.  Compared with my laptop, the Xoom's size and weight aren't an issue.\nI was worried when first started using it: the flash had just been released and still wouldn't play the videos & games from some of the sites I went to, and I couldn't get the digital copies (that came with my blu rays) to play once I had transfered them over to the xoom.  Hulu and netflix still aren't available either. I got on a xoom forum which helped a lot with figuring things out, including how to keep the mobile version of websites from loading by default.  I had to buy software that would legally break the lock on the movies that I have (yes, I am sure there was free illegal software out there to do the same thing).  The flash is working much better these days too.\nI definitely think the Xoom isn't for everybody.  Its much harder to learn to use (I saw another revier use a chess/checkers analogy, which I kinda agree with), but I like how I can set things up exactly how I want, load off-market content, and even root the device if I ever decide I want to do that.  The android market lacks the polish and all-encompasing media capabilities that iTunes has, but it looks like Amazon might be ramping up to fill that void.  The iPad is great b/c anyone can pick one up and use it...my toddler has an iPad which is perfect for her, whereas the xoom just wouldn't work for her.  I'll probably end up buying an iPad2 for my wife once the ey are readily available in the store...but I'll definitely stick with my Xoom!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have eagerly awaited for the Xoom and ordered the WiFi version. I have had it for two days and I am disappointed. I read all of the reviews on Amazon and on Cnet so I was eager to dive in. I am not a techie but can hold my own with technology. I have come to believe that I am not technical enough for this tablet. It feels like my Android phone has more functionality than the Xoom. I assumed all the apps on my phone would work on the Xoom  but they don't, for instance my bank app. The Xoom froze within the first hour of turning it on and I have had to do a hard restart twice in my 4 hours of interacting with it. I found the web browser annoying because all the sites I would go to would offer me to download an app that either didn't exist or didn't work. I did love the honeycomb screens and using apps like Google maps, YouTube and Movies rocked. Unfortunately, I found myself picking up my phone to supplement the Xoom to get want I really wanted. I LOVED the Droid Incredible phone from the moment I got it even through the new phone learning curve. I do not love the Xoom and so I am returning it to Amazon mainly because for $600 I want to love owning it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Before I begin my review of the Xoom, I'd like to say that I purchased it in addition to the iPad (1st Generation) and iPod Touch (3rd Generation) because I felt limited by some of the iOS features and options. While the iPad is simple and intuitive to use, I was unable to view Flash on the web or manipulate and access the file system on the device. While there remains to be more apps to be developed for Android 3.0 tablet devices, this was the case for the iOS when it first appeared. The potential for development is there, and I look forward to seeing more Android tablet apps in the near future. The apps created for earlier versions of Android appear to be stretched out versions on the Xoom, and need to be altered for use on a tablet.\n\nAs far as Xoom hardware goes, the device is narrower and longer than the iPad. I am impressed with the quality of the unit, including the touch screen. The unit feels stable and works well. My coworkers like it, and everyone who sees it, comments that the Xoom is attractive. I have not used the camera much; however, the couple of pictures that I did take are clear and sharp. The SD slot is not enabled yet, but upon calling Motorola I was assured that there is an upcoming software update that will resolve this. The battery life is about 8-10 hours and recharges more quickly than the iPad does.\n\nHoneycomb allows for customization with widgets, live wallpapers, an multi-page outline grid, and for those apps that aren't used much, they can be kept in the background. While the iOS is currently more stable than the Honeycomb, this is because it has been around longer, and I believe that only a matter of time when updates will work out the kinks in Android 3.0.\n\nIt's easier to transfer files between a computer and the Xoom: plug in the USB cable and the Xoom appears as a hard drive which you can drag and drop files to and from. Also, there are free file explorer apps that allow for management of files and folders on the device. The iPad requires you to plug in the device to iTunes on a computer to backup and manage files on the device, and you are limited to purchasing apps from iTunes. On the Xoom as with all Android devices, you are free to purchase apps from any Android market as well as download apps directly from any website (as with Windows and Mac). There is a notification system that transmits information about the various apps installed on your device such as email, new Twitter and Facebook messages, installation updates, etc. The Chrome browser, Google email, Google maps and GPS work seamlessly on the device.\n\nWhile the iPad is easier to use, I appreciate the depth of the Android 3.0 system and enjoy discovering new aspects of it (I'm still learning). I know many people who say they will buy an Android tablet because it is more like a laptop--with more customization options and available app markets. Overall, I'm not disappointed with my purchase of the Xoom, and I think Motorola produced an attractive, sturdy and effective device for using the Android 3.0 system.\n\nMay 15, 2011 Update:  I really like the Xoom and believe the sales numbers and user complaints (many of which are from people who don't own the product) do not convey the product's quality. No Android tablet should be expected to sell in significant enough numbers to stand up to the iPad within the first couple months of its launch--especially given the knowledge that more Android tablets are expected later in the year. Every Android tablet besides the iPad will not be competitive until the form factor is as accepted as the Android smartphone. That said, the Motorola Xoom works even better now with the 3.1 update, which has to do with the Android system, not the hardware. I enjoy using the Xoom more and more as new apps introduced to the market every week, and I look forward to using the SD card capability.\n\nPros:\nQuality Construction, Easy To Use, Low Power Consumption, Easy To Setup, Customization Options, Accessible File System\n\nCons:\nNeed more tablet apps, Occasional app freezes\n\nAccessories I Recommend\n* ZooGue Leather Case for Xoom"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "First and foremost- What every prospective tablet user needs to consider: What am I planning on doing with my tablet?\nFor most users, tablets are for entertainment and are considered a luxury item.  They aren't good for working on school work, or anything that requires a lot of typing, so for most people, these devices are for consuming media (news, videos, social networks...).\n\nWhy pick the Wifi only:\nWhen I was looking at Xooms at the local electronics establishment, I was confronted with the decision of getting the $599 Xoom Wifi or the $799 Xoom 3G/Wifi (upgradeable to 4G at a later date at no cost).  For me, while 3G was tempting for convenience, it was still a pretty easy decision to buy the Wifi only device.  With the 3G, you are tied into a service contract.  If you go with Verizon's service (which is advertized with the device), you only pay $599 for the device, but you have to pay $20 a month for 24 months.  On top of that, you can only use 1GB of data.  For a device that is going to be used for the consumption of data (especially videos), I don't want to be limited to only 1GB.  Another decision point was the fact that I knew my Xoom would be used mostly at home, where I have a Wifi network, or at local eatting establishments that provide free Wifi.  The real nail in the coffin on this decision was that my 4G phone is capable of wireless teathering and my data plan is unlimited- taking that into consideration- there really is no need to pay for an additional data plan.\n\nThe Device- an out of the box look:\nOut of the box, you find the approximately 1.5 lbs device, power cable, and a couple booklets.  I would have been nice to have a sleeve for the Xoom, but Motorola doesn't provide any type of protection for the tablet.  I made sure to pick up a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ZAGG-invisibleSHIELD-for-Motorola-Xoom-Screen-MOTXOOMS/dp/B004S748UY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ZAGG invisibleSHIELD for Motorola Xoom (Screen) (MOTXOOMS)</a>&nbsp;to make sure my screen stayed pristine.  The device is a solid little tablet.  The back id 4/5 aluminum and the top part of the back case is rubberized plastic.\n\nThe hardware feels solid.  Additionally, the layout of the device generally makes sense.  The power button was a little confusing, but once I found it on the back, the idea really grew on me.  It will be a little wierd when it comes to accessories, but I have no complaint about the device itself.  Next to the power button, there is the HD camera lense with LED flash.  Having an HD camera is nice, even if shooting pictures on a tablet isn't really practicle.  The back of the device also includes stero speakers that are surprisingly loud for a device of this size.\n\nAll of the connectors (power, usb, dock...) are all located on the bottom of the device, except the headphone jack.  Not sure I am a fan of this oddity, but I have yet to use headphones, so it is not really an issue to date.  Also, the volme buttons are located on the left side of the device and are sufficiently easy to reach and use.\n\nOn the face of the device, there is a forward facing camera- this is great for video chatting.  While GTalk works, Skype currently does not support video chat on this device (app issue, not hardware).  There is also a light senseor- I hate the light sensor- I sometimes find that the brightness of the screen changes abruptly by a huge amount because I accidently put my thumb over the sensor.  The best fix for this is to just turn off the auto adjustment.\n\nOrientation:\nDeviating from the norm, the Xoom is built to be oriented in landscape mode rather than portrait mode.  With the 10 inch screen, landscape works great.  I find that I am able to thumb type on the on-screen keyboard without straining much to reach the keys in the middle.  The size is really what makes landscape work well with this tablet.  In portrait, I (like many others) find that the device is a little bit hard to balance- feeling a little top heavy.  It isn't so bad that the device is difficult to use- it just takes a little getting used to.\n\nAndroid:\nThe android 3.0, Honeycomb load on this device is great.  Many who don't use android or are iPad users will probably find that the device will take a little bit of learning to get used to.  I am an android user (though my phone has an older version of android), and found that I was able to fully use and understand the device in 30 minutes of playing with it.  The learning period may take up to a day, but once you fiure it out, you will notice that the controls really make sense and are easy to find when you need them.\n\nOverall, I love this little device.  There are some minor little design dislikes, but nothing that impacts my 5 star rating of this device!"}

I picked up the Xoom because i saw alot of potential in the device.  i still believe it is a superior device to the ipad2, BUT as a product it fails and these are my reasons.\n\nwhile the xoom has alot going for it in terms of hardware (1G ram, processor, expandable memory, hi res screen, front and back cameras, setero speakers, etc) it's design is not as user focused as the ipad and in some cases seems to be an attempt at being a mimic rather than original design.  for example, to auto lock the rotating screen the ipad has a simple external switch whereas the xoom requires a user to navigate through a series of menus in the settings module everytime you intend to lock/unlock.  not a big deal, but annoying.  Ipad has a built in bandwidth usage meter where xoom requires you to install a verizon app which, as per it's reviews in google market, has some problems.  this leads me to the biggest overall issue i have with this product.  Again.  the device is impressive, but what good is it if the availbility of usable apps are lacking?  The google market for honeycomb apps is HORRIBLE!  I went in there ready to buy but when searching for good apps to install i would get 3,286 returns out of which only 20 were interesting enough to install...BUT when you read the reviews on these 20 apps they tend to be series of 1 star reviews with phrases like, \"doesnt work...crashes...dont waste your money..\".  There still needs to be alot more development for andriod 3.0 apps.\nI primarily bought this device for my commute to and from work.  I thought that with flashplayer i would have access to the sites i would not have access to with the ipad.  Unfortunately, some of the sites i do have access to with the ipad I can't view with the xoom, even with the flashplayer.\nPotential buyers should be aware that you will not be able to view netflix, hulu or vudu as the apps don't work or exist on the honeycomb OS and the OS doesnt support them in the browser.\n\nBottom line:  Its a nice piece of hardware, but what are you going to do with it?  theres some tablet games you could buy on it...but for a $684+ device??  I'd expect more.  There are so many other devices on the market for a fraction of the cost that would provide web browsing, movie playback, and emails.  Returning mine after a day."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I'm an IT guy with love for gadgets and technology. This is my first tablet, which I compared to several other options that I had (such as - galaxy tab, iPad, rooted Nook Color and etc).\n\nFor me, the push for looking into buying a tablet came form the intention of not picking up a laptop for random browsing, news reading, checking email, wiki, online shopping, watching movies/videos. listening to music and lite gaming throughout the day when I'm being lazy. So my usage would be unlike many other people, who would ALSO use this tablet for work purpose (presentation, sales, seminar, education, hospitals and etc).\n\nExperience Bad (YMMV): **Note i'm not calling these Cons**\n1. There are not enough apps out for this device. I have had several apps force close on me. For spending $600 on a device and not having the full experience is not a good feeling. I know that this will change with future updates and releases of apps, but apps are not there yet.\n2. Proprietary charging pin/socket. Can't use any off the shelf USB charger. It charges at 12V. Which means if you're traveling with this, you have to carry the charger and also can't use any external battery system.\n3. SD card is not activated yet. Future software upgrade will fix it. But like I said for a $600 payment I'd like to get the \"full experience\" now.\n4. Front Flash lights are very bright. Not sure if it's a con, but we couldn't keep looking at the camera since the flash is longer that usual while it gets the focus... obviously by the time the shutter clicked our eyes were closed... hehe.\n5. The back camera features are NOT for me (this goes against all tablets). I just don't think I'll be taking pictures/videos holding a 10.1\" device while traveling or at a party or in a picnic and etc. I think the process is inefficient due to the size of the device. My point is that I can use a proper camera or cell phone to do the job much better and conveniently.\n6. For my usage, what I felt was that, this tablet is too big for me to pick up while laying on the couch in front of the TV or even trying to manage my 14 month old daughter while holding it. Both hands or a solid grip (means finger on top of the touch screen) was required every time.\n7. During extended reading/browsing on bed it feels heavy after 15-20 mins. It's not something that I can hold up for over 20 minutes and not feel the burn.\n8. No mini HDMI cable or adapter. For that much price why not add in a small adapter? It would raise the product value and company image a lot.\n\nPROS:\n1. Android OS - Honeycomb is an absolute delight. Beautiful OS. Well thought-out design. Gotta love Google.\n2. Dual core, lots of ram... overall HARDWARE is the best. Lots of ppl said IPAD's screen is better but I don't think so.\n3. Resolution on the screen, touch sensitivity is simply great.\n4. Almost Edgeless screen... beautiful.\n5. Great build... it didn't feel \"all plastic\" to me at all. The all black color is simply awesome. Makes the look very slick.\n6. Really great battery life. After a full-charge, I had it on standby for a day and it still had 100% charge afterwards... loved it.\n7. Awesome speed at running anything.\n8. High resolution Dual camera, takes good picture and video. I loved it apart from the flash timing.\n9. It comes with a USB cable.\n\nThis is great a product. Thanks for giving us something to look up-to against Apple's pricey iPad. Even though, I think, Apple makes great products and they pioneered the touch-screen revolution, but they do charge for it in product pricing. Any case, thanks to Google for an Open source OS and all the big-hearted developers that make Android the best thing for almost at no-cost. Motorola XOOM makes that experience better with great promises.\n\nI'm rating this a 4 for not giving me the \"full experience\" now and leaving thing's unfinished with future promises."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have had my Xoom for two weeks now (wifi only) and I have to say I have been learning something new with it every day.  I was able to connect it to my 2 Tb hardrive (on my home network) and download movies, applications, etc.  The feel of it is nice.  I also bought a Skinomi protective screen for my tablet.  (Be advised, if you buy the Skinomi screen, it is a VERY VERY VERY good investment for your tablet; make sure you spray your hands with the solution and SOAK the protective screen on both sides or you will have a lot of difficulty applying it to your device.  Don't be concerned with the smudges an bubbles, they go away after 48 hrs.  Just be patient). It does help with the fingerprints (you won't see them as much as you would on the unprotected screen).  This is my honest review and I apologize if it is not indepth.  I am not biased toward Xoom or Ipad or toward any other tablet for that matter.  If you want a true tablet/pc experience I suggest you get a Xoom. Here are a few tips with Xoom.  EDIT:  The one thing I love about this device is you DO NOT HAVE TO ROOT IT to take advantage of the tablet (similiar to jailbreaking Apple product; which you have to do to get more out of their devices).\n\nTURN OFF WEBSITE LOCATION\n\nFor those of us who are in another country or in a US Territory. Certain apps (in fact the majority of them) in the Android market will not allow you to download. You get a message such as \"Cannot be donwloaded due to carrier\" or something to that affect.  What you have to do is go into the browser and in the right corner click the internet icon (looks like a piece of paper).  Select internet settings and look for location settings.  TURN LOCATION OFF.  That is all you have to do.  Then go back into the App store and begin your download.  You can also do this for google books so it will work.\n\nCUSTOMIZE SIZE OF WIDGETS\n\nIf you do not like the widgets taking up your screen, you can customize using Launcher Pro.  This is not a Honeycomb application but it works on the Xoom. It frees up the real estate on the screen and even gives you mutlitple screens (more than the stock 5 that comes with honeycomb).  I personally prefer the stock honeycomb though.\n\nES FILES\n\nThe ES Files is an easy way to manage your folders on your Xoom. Frankly, this is the best way to connect your Xoom to a hard drive on your network (as I mentioned previously).  It also allows you to easily manage your downloads.\n\nMEDIA PLAYER\n\nMobo Player for Android is one of the better media players out there for the Xoom. If you are having difficulty viewing videos on your device, download this player.  It fully takes advantage of the HD experience.\n\nDOWNLOADING\n\nMake sure you check UNKNOWN SOURCES in the settings menu if you want to download things from the internet (you can't do that with Ipad).\n\nAnyway, as I get familiar with my device, the more I perceive its relevance.  I am able to remote desktop into my home network, view netflix, and various other activities that I cannot do on my computer.  If you are looking for a versatile device; the Xoom is it.\n\nFLAWS\nNow, so I am not committing the fallacy of \"Stacking the Evidence,\" the Xoom is not without its flaws.  There are certain items that will \"Force Close\".  This has nothing to do with the device itself, but rather the software.  Honeycomb is fairly new and it is not without its bugs.  The CNN app can slow the device at times and certain apps (when ran together in the background) may not agree with each other.  Anyway, as I said, the Xoom is where it is at. Multitasking, internet browsing, movie downloading, streaming, music, etc, etc."}

But all these reviews on the internet and here on Amazon that give negative reviews of the Xoom make me suspicious. I mean, the Ipad is a nice piece of hardware and the Apps are optimized to perform well. But this constant bickering of Ipad is better than this or that is ridiculous. I watched a video review on Youtube of a guy who gave the edge in the majority of categories to the Xoom, but chose and praised the Ipad in the end.\n\nI hate Itunes and being forced to use that interface. I like simple connections with flexibility. Ipads are simple and easy to use like a toy, Honeycomb tablets are more for people who like to customize and want more freedoms. If anyone spends a week or two on the Xoom and is honest, there isn't much to not like. It is super fast, feels solid and performs amazingly well. Apps will proliferate so I am not worried and price isn't that bad considering smartphones to purchase off contract are $500 and more."}

In fact, I believe that the only way to dislike this tablet is to be an Apple worshipper! The reasons I like it are:\n\n1. It is slick. The tablet is well made and well laid out. The orientation preference is great. One doesn't have to feel like they took a step down to own this tablet.\n\n2. It is fast. It does everything faster than the I pad. While your friends with an I pad are waiting for an app to open or a web page to load, you will already be enjoying it.\n\n3. It is easy to use. It doesn't come with much of a manual because you won't need much of a manual. In other words, the whole thing is very intuitive.\n\n4. It is an open system. I can watch flash video. I have downloaded apps from the Android Market and from Amazon. I just watched a HD video with it connected to my TV. In other words, Steve Jobs does not get to tell me how to use my device or what I can put on it.\n\nThe only drawback that I can think of is the small number of apps that are designed for the Android 3.0 system; however, I suspect that will change quickly."}

Everything works, but the user experience has all sorts of little rough edges.  My wife, who is a non-technical person, put it this way: \"it's more functional, but not as nice to use as the iPad.\"  My guess is that this product was rushed out the door.\n\nGoogle and Motorola are likely working around-the-clock to release the software updates necessary to make the XOOM's user experience as beautiful and smooth as the iPad's, so I'd expect the product to be superior to the original iPad within a year or so."}

I don't know what the refresh rate is but the xoom seems to have some issues with ghosting when i watch movies.. not sure if this is just how i encoded movies but i notice it on apps as well\n\n-MicroSD doesnt work\n-There is some inherent lag in some apps and will have some built up lag after heavy use..for example: keyboard input lags after extensive use\n-touch screen isn't as accurate as ipod/iphone.. I may not be used to tablets.. have not used ipad but i have an iphone and almost never miss links or bullets.. i find myself constantly missing link and bullets when browsing with xoom\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that Honeycomb needs some fine tuning.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I've had the Motorola Xoom WiFi for about two weeks. I can only compare this to the original iPad.  In general, the Xoom does most everything the iPad can do except faster.  I haven't had the chance to use an iPad2 long enough to compare speeds with the Xoom.\n\nThe screen size is 10.1\" though slightly narrower than the iPad.  It took only minutes to setup and start using. There were no setup or network connection issues.  The screen is responsive and is no better or worse than the iPad.  In general, I find that the iPad's display is a bit more vibrant than the Xoom.\n\nThe only feature where the Xoom is rather poor is with video playback.  The video quality has a faded, washed-out appearance compared to the iPad.  It's not unwatchable by any stretch, but given the relatively high resolution of the Xoom, it's disappointing.  Also, due to Digital Rights Management restrictions, converting any DRM video to be playable on the Xoom can be a time consuming operation.\n\nThe number of apps geared towards an Android tablet are also lacking.  That's not entirely surprising, but it's still a gap worth noting when deciding to buy.  Some apps scale up well (e.g. Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja), while others look terrible (most solitaire games I've tried).\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the Xoom and the Honeycomb interface."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I just got the Xoom wi-fi for my birthday and absolutely love it! Since I also own the Motorola Droid X phone, the Xoom has a very familiar feel to it (with regards to operation, apps, etc.), even though it comes with the Android 3.01 Honeycomb operating system (rather than 2.2 Froyo which the DroidX has). Honeycomb is much nicer/smoother/faster than Froyo operating system, so that was definitely a plus. The dual core processor is very fast also. I have seen no lag at all on the Xoom tablet. It runs every app I've thrown at it without a hitch. It looks awesome running the Kindle app, and I am now able to read my books on a much larger screen than the Kindle device! :)  Having wi-fi only is not a major concern for me, as we have a wireless network at home, and when on the road, you can usually find wi-fi anywhere you go. Plus we are saving a bundle by not having to pay our carrier for their expensive data plan (when we already are paying for 3 of them on our cell phones!). Oh, and for anyone who is wondering.... yes, Angry Birds runs on the Xoom and looks amazing!!! :)"}

Flash works fine on the Xoom and I really like using the Xoom in general.  BUT, I travel a lot and, because I find myself in places with no WiFi available, I have an (expensive) tethering plan on my AT&T cell phone that can use USB, Bluetooth, or Wifi.  So, I figured I could get the $200 less expensive WiFi only Xoom (and also save $50 per month for an additional data plan) and tether it to my phone.  The phone's WiFi tethering works great on my laptop computer. I am told the WiFi tethering works with an Ipad.\n\nThe Xoom has no USB that can be used for this purpose.  Bluetooth gives an error when you try to tether with it and THE XOOM DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE WIFI AD-HOC NETWORKING THAT TETHERING PHONES USE.  I am told there is no technical reason for this other than the capability has been turned off in the operating system.  If I don't hear that this will be \"fixed\" soon, or at least hacked, I will be returning the Xoom.\n\nONE MONTH LATER:  I still am very unhappy about the lack of Ad-Hock network connectivity and am now wondering if/when the SD card expansion will happen.

I have had my Xoom for about two weeks now and have used it far more than I ever did the iPad.  The iPad is a great game machine and it is still the best tablet for my kids, but Android is just more useful for my every day life.  Email, Calendar, Browser, weather.  Everything at a glance right when I turn it on.  No real problems so far, although it probably took me a full minute to finally find the power button, I can't figure out if the placement is idiotic or brilliant.  The app situation is much better for Xoom than it was for the first generation iPad.  Many stock android apps automatically handle the larger screen size, so you don't have to rely on a hacky \"zoom\" mode for apps.  My favorite feature is the \"real\" chrome browser.  It is a huge upgrade over the iPad browser.  Since that is my most used application, it's a big winner for me."}

Firstly and most improtantly I am a convert and no not ot Apple but to the whole Tablet PC idea, I believed they were just another electronic toy and served space between a Smartphone and Laptop.  They are in fact little PC's and can serve up a good PC experence and take up little space in the process, they are reasonably quick and with the right Software should be able to perform most LapTop functions reasonably well.  Course were not talking raging speed here but more than adequate for most task and easliy capable to surf the web, chat, e-mail etc.\nRather than to discuss my preference for Tablets I'll just say up front I like the Xoom, the Operating System, Performance, and Unlike Apple delivers a overall better experence if your looking for a complete product versus one that has been Nutered and all the decisions made for you what is and is NOT important, then the Xoom is your Tablet.  All the basics are there and those not working yet will be during the Update process at some point, as for the IPad some of these Basics are NOT there and will never be possible even with furture Updates.  In short what may be trival now could be the difference between a true Laptop replacement or one that partially replaces it and Annoys you when a Function doesn't work cause someone said you can't have it.\nOf course there are things that the IPad does better, the Screen on the IPad is Spectacular but on the flip side the Xoom is Beautiful (no deal Breaker here), The IPad is simplistic, you know the difference between what is and is not and who makes the decision ( a personal decision)!  I don't think either of these products is a bad purchase and for doing Basic PC task they are both equally adept, but one has the makings to be a real PC the other Does not.\n\nGood Luck."}

Since Xoom uses Android from Google as OS, I would like to review hardware and software separately.\n\nHardware/packaging\n\nWhen you buy a luxury car or something luxury, you will feel elegancy with every piece of it even the manual and accessaries.  This is true to Ipad and other apple product box. When I opened IPAD box, I had a feeling that I opened a luxury product.  But when I opened the Motorola Xoom box, my first feeling is that this is just a so so product. The plastic sticked to Xoom is not evenly glued. some part of it peeled off a little bit. The manual paper does not fit well in box.  The micro USB cable is packed the same way as the one you buy from dollar store, so is the power adapter.  Since I have not used XOOM much, I will put hardware review for XOOM a little later.\n\nSoftware\n\nIn the past, I really enjoyed most Google's product.  In my mind, the spirit of Google's product is EAST, FAST and POWERFUL.  I appreciated that concept and tried my best to put that concept in every product I design.  So when I got Xoom android, I expected that same thing. But I was disappointed.  I have more than 25 years in the IT world and have used my hardware and software. during the first few hours of using Android, I could not figured out how to close an application and how to remove an application on the desktop. I had to search google to find the answer.  I never had that problem with IPAD.  Android might be very powerful, but if I need to take a lesson in order to use it as an end user, I would say the designed is failed.\n\nOverall, I think Xoom/Android has a long way to catch up with IPAD.

I will keep it short because let's face it, writing a long review on a tablet computer without an external keyboard is tedious regardless if it is an ipad or xoom.  I bought an ipad last year and returned it within a week.  Why you ask?  Well let me say that apple's product made the tablet market what it is today so it wasn't for lack of the sheek factor and I also felt they did a good job in simplifying the OS for the tablet.  Still, I knew something better would come along and the product felt unfinished in a lot of ways.  Very few ways of connecting externally, no flash support, and to be honest the OS was almost too simple for me.  Now to the xoom, boy am I glad I waited.  The OS is smooth and just a little more customizable and interesting for my taste.  I should note that I also own a droid phone so I was already familiar with it.  Having flash support on a tablet is quite simply awesome especially after my experience with the ipad.  I can stream a sports game and watch it from my bed or the couch without fail.  I really enjoyed browsing the web with the ipad but the lack of flash support was a pain.  Apple's OS simplicity is a blessing and a burden...multitasking is a pain and the notification system sucks in my opinion.  On the xoom, all your notifications pop in the bottom right of the screen allowing seamless movement between tasks and programs which require your attention.  Switching programs is easy and you can quickly advance to the next song on last FM and get back to writing that email.  I highly recommend this product."}

Some examples:\n\n*News and Weather widget that I love on my Nexus One is absent.\n*Android Market doesn't allow you to rate applications\n*Can't install Adobe Reader, missing from the market\n*Many high-profile apps don't run (AKA force close on launch) including Pandora and the Facebook Widget.\n*Micro-SD Card slot doesn't work\n*Mounting the internal storage to transfer files on Ubuntu or any Linux is a pain.\n*OS is a bit unstable at times\n\nOther Non-Android related issues:\n\n*Can't charge using USB cable, requires separate power cable.\n*Screen is a bit too wide to comfortably thumb type in landscape mode.\n*Still no Netflix app :( (but amazon streaming works very well for prime members)\n\nMost of these issues are fixable with a firmware update, and Android 3.0 has a TON of potential.\n\nA few things that I really liked about this tablet:\n\n*Great camera, although you look like a nerd using it.\n*Great browser\n*Very fast and responsive\n*Sound is surprisingly good.\n*Video playback is very good."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have owned the first iPad for just over a year now. My interest in tablet devices is from a business point of view. Is the product viable in the Enterprise.\nFor the iPad, the answer is No. My hope was that the Xoom would be more accommodating. Unfortunately, it appears that this hope is misplaced. So here goes with my findings to date on the Xoom:\n\n1. Setup of email was a pain and took several hours and researching the Motorola documents and various forums for a final solution. Compare this to the iPad where it only took a few minutes. My company uses hosted email services and in turn this provider uses MS Exchange 2003. The available selection of \"Corporate\" for email setup can not be used in this scenario. You must go through the other available choice of \"Email\". My frustration level was very high on this setup. I found the whole experience extremely distasteful and I quickly became disenchanted with the entire device.\n\n2. The embedded browser seems to be based on Chrome. However, there are sufficient differences to make it completely worthless for Enterprise users. The primary problem is that this browser will not transmit credentials via NTLM. We have many applications where this is a mandatory requirement. We use Microsoft Sharepoint for document sharing and attempting to use the embedded browser for logging into our Sharepoint site is not possible. We also use Peoplesoft for the input of employee time sheets and expense reports. This too is not available via the embedded browser. We also use a ticketing system to track IT issues and complaints and again, the embedded browser will not work. I was able to install the newest version of Firefox and that resolved almost all of the issues above.\n\n3. The Previewing of various document formats such as Excel documents, Word documents, and PDF documents seems to work quite well out of the box. I did purchase the QuickOffice application and am in the process of evaluating that application.\n\n4. The installation of applications is not as smooth as on the iPad. Although it is not a business application, I did try to install the Pandora application for music streaming. (Even us business types like our music:) I was very disappointed in the Pandora app as it never was able to start. It crashed immediately. I don't fault the Xoom completely with this however.\n\n5. The Xoom is noticeably heavier than the iPad.\n\n6. It appears the glass screen lacks the oleophobic coating of iPad. I noticed that my fingers don't glide over the surface as easily and its a magnet for any oils on your hands.\n\n7. The power button is on the BACK of the device. This warrants a \"what were they thinking\" retort.\n\nI am sincerely hoping that the product improves over time. I very much hope they don't leave all of \"us\" early adopters holding the bag and abandon us like they have many phone users in the past.\nI think this platform has much more potential for the Enterprise than iPad. That could change however if Apple abandons the mandatory iTunes connectivity for updates to iPad."}

I work IT, so like most IT, we hate the apple box. No customization, no freedom, no notifications, etc...Among all that, the honeycomb operating system is AMAZING! Talk about something that makes sense, not just a box with apps in it. Its usable! Email, online trading, video chat, etc, so much easier and correctly done with Google! This honestly makes the Ipad feel and look like a joke.  Only downside...limited apps, but those should be fixed in the coming months. Key feature: FLASH WORKS! yay! I get the internet back! Try a browsing session with an apple product that doesnt support flash, terrible experience..."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have purchased both an Ipad2 and Xoom for different family members.  I thought it worth comparing the two devices for anyone interested.  Many of my comments are subjective so bear that in mind when reading the review.  I notice that reviews that love the Xoom are overwhelmingly marked \"helpful\" and those with even slight negatives are are usually marked \"unhelpful\", so I expect this review will get poor ratings.\n\nExternal appearance and feel:\nThe Ipad2 screen has a different feel from the Xoom screen - the Ipad2 is a bit slicker, less likely to stick when moving short distances.  The screen on the Xoom tends to show fingerprints more than the Ipad2 for some reason. Everyone in this family thinks that the Ipad2 looks sharper than the Xoom.\n\nBoth weigh 1.6 lbs.  Subjectively, the Xoom feels heavier than the Ipad2, but it's an illusion perhaps caused by it's slightly smaller size.\n\nBoth have a similar size screen, measured diagonally.  But the aspect ratio is different - 4:3 for Ipad2, 16:9 for Xoom.  This means that the Ipad2 actually has a larger viewing area, and this makes a real difference when scrolling through a web site.  The Ipad2 screen is brighter than the Xoom screen.\n\nHardware performance:\nThe Xoom feels a bit faster than the Ipad2, and the specs show that it is faster.  Both have dual core processors based on ARM designs.  The Xoom seems to be able to handle graphics better than the Ipad2.  As far as connecting to Wifi networks, both seem to have this one down pat - they both just work.\n\nUser Interface:\nThe Ipad2 is just like a big iPhone.  Whether this good or bad is subjective.  For me, it's good - polished, flexible and can be customized to my needs.  The Xoom user interface is totally new, and unfortunately it shows - there are many rough edges.  Some examples: moving icons around to group programs together is not intuitive and they keep moving back; you can see the first 5 applications running on the Xoom and select one, but the list doesn't scroll so applications that don't show in the list can't be selected; you can't close applications (except by a force quit that can lose data) as the Xoom decides when to quit an application; customization is possible but more difficult than the Ipad2.  In short, the Xoom user interface is a work in progress - great potential but currently quite flawed.\n\nOperating System:\nThe Ipad2 uses Apple's IOS.  It works, but it uses cooperative multitasking which (in theory) is less effective than the full multitasking on the Xoom which uses a version of Google's Android designed for tablets.  In practice, they both work fine and I doubt anyone would notice the difference.\n\nApplications:\nIpad2 has 70,000 apps available from the Apple App store and it also runs the 300,000 apps available for the iPhone.  Xoom currently has around 60 apps and it can run Android phone apps (but they are stretched in one direction which makes them look strange).  Some of the Ipad2 applications are pretty impressive - GarageBand for example.  There are many games on the Ipad2, and just a few games made for the Xoom.  I really hope this improves soon otherwise the Xoom is sunk.  After all, applications are generally the reason people buy these devices.\n\nBrowsing:\nBecause of the screen aspect ratio that I mentioned, I prefer browsing on the Ipad2.  The Xoom has Adobe Flash and the Ipad2 doesn't, but so far I haven't come across a single instance where this has been an issue.  I'm sure there are very many sites not compatible with Ipad2, but I haven't browsed to one of them yet.\n\nCamera:\nI don't use the camera much, and I'm not really sure if either is better.  In the family, the Xoom owner says the Xoom is better, the Ipad2 owner says the Ipad2.  The Xoom has flash and Ipad2 doesn't which is a win for Xoom, but the Xoom seems slower to take a picture.\n\nSpeakers:\nThe Xoom has two small speakers, Ipad2 has one somewhat larger speaker.  The sound is slightly better quality on the Ipad2 and the Xoom cannot achieve the same volume as the Ipad2.  But they are both pretty poor - use earphones or an external speaker if you want decent audio.\n\nBattery life:\nDifficult for me to give an exact comparison, but based on family usage it seems the Ipad2 has the edge here, but not by much.\n\nInternal storage:\nThe Xoom has 1GB of RAM and 32 GB of flash storage.  The Ipad2 has 512MB of RAM and 16GB, 32GB or 64GB of flash storage - I bought the 64GB model.\n\nExternal storage:\nThe Xoom has an external card slot that supports SD cards, but the software was not ready in time for the product release.  The slot is inoperative until Motorola releases an operating system update.  The Ipad2 has no external storage support.\n\nUser Experience:\nThe Ipad2 was up and running quite quickly.  I connected the device to ITunes and it automatically updated to the latest version of the operating system.  I was then able to select and download Apps immediately and start using them.\n\nThe Xoom was not so easy.  For some reason, I was not able to install the latest version of Google Maps or Adobe Flash.  I was able to download the apps, and the install process appeared to work without errors, but the new apps just were not installed.  After some time trying I finally returned the Xoom back to the factory settings and started again, and this time both the installs worked.  Of course, this wouldn't be a good solution if you had a ton of applications and/or data on the device.\n\nSupport:\nApple has their retail stores.  You can get a huge amount of help from these stores from people whose only job is to support users.  Both Ipad2 and Xoom users have web sites available that support their products but you have to spend the time digging for the sites and digging through the sites.  You can also purchase an Applecare support package which gives you a couple of years extra support for the Ipad2.\n\nBottom line:\nI believe the Xoom hardware is slightly better than the Ipad2 (apart from the screen aspect ratio and the speakers), but the software is terribly lacking.  The Xoom was released FAR too early, it's just not ready for primetime.  But it has great potential.\n\nIf I had to pick just one, I'd pick the Ipad2 at the moment - less hassle, apps for everything, better browsing experience, better support options.  The Xoom needs less buggy software and more applications; it has great potential but it's not there yet."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Great reviews have been posted already showing advantages and disadvantages over a Xoom Tablet to Ipad2...\n\nConclusion is simple. Both are great devices and you will likely be happy with whatever your choice will be.\n\nIf you are a more of a Geeky Person and like to customize, change, modify your tablet the Xoom is the way to go. Yes, I know, you can jailbreak your Ipad2 and do the same thing. Yes, agree but still you will never have the options to change roms, kernels, as you do with an Android Device.\n\nIf you are reading this reviews it is because you are considering buying the xoom... Just do it... You will not regret it. And for all those that tell you that iPad2 is better... Yes They will also say that the iphone is better than the Motorola Atrix or Better than the Evo 3d"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "This tablet is hands down the best on the market.  From the good cameras on it all the way down to the operating system built specifically for tablets.  It operates very smoothly and is extremely responsive.  If you've never owned an android device before it will be a little foreign, but is still very user friendly.  The on-screen keyboard is very usable.  The picture quality is unparallelled.  The games developed for the Tegra chip are breathtaking.  This tablet definitely beats the iPad 2 or any other tablet out there right now."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MOTOROLA-XOOM-Android-Tablet-Wi-Fi/dp/B0045FM6SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MOTOROLA XOOM Android Tablet (Wi-Fi)</a>Was so looking forward to the this Xoom, in fact, I was surprised they put out a Wi-Fi only so quickly to the market, but as I am trying to justify my recent splurge of my recent purchase of it, I am equally dissapointed that it fails to hit the mark. It wows where it needs to, but falls short of spectacular, kind ohhh, but not aaaah. I am great supporter of the Android Platform, have Android Mobiles, and enjoy the freedom and versatility of it's modding capabilities and frequent allowance of updates and customization which is so limited on Apple Products. This is not an IPad, I hate to say it.\n\nThe failure for the Google Honeycomb Software on this Motorola Xoom , Which is latest Android 3.01 (actually came with the latest upgrade INCLUDING the latest Adobe Flash), to properly demonstrate any sort of Video Streaming capability (minus YouTube big woop) was my greatest cause for question. The few Adobe Flash laced apps, which I believe for the most part are CNN, Pulse, and the usual flash gaming options are specatacular for a table, it still seems shortsighted for Motorola as a company, and if Samsung soon follows suit, to release this product with Honeycomb, but without, at least, Netflix, Hulu, or possibly Redbox backed streaming ANYTHING resembling On Demand Video Streaming. Of course this all boils down to DRM (Digital Rights Media)code lacking in Google Android, and of course this means, fingers in the pie and greed from the entertainment industry. I wouldn't be surprised if money is changing hands right now to keep this ongoing (Apple, Movie Industry, Microsoft)?? . And BTW,  a great majority of favorite Android apps are NOT cross-platform compatible with Honeycomb from Gingerbread based OS, YES ANGRYBIRDS and a few other games, and a handful of Labeled TABLET APPS. So I am sitting thinking do I need to root this thing to get at least basic functionality of of a proper backup provisions, even SD card access, nor communications apps, for none of this available on my Xoom at the mo. These capabilites are not standard UNLESS one ROOTS this Xoom Tablet, and although you can download, they are not workable, this should not be.\n\nThis is a basic disappointing frustration to watch the Google powerhouse be guilded by the Entertainment consortium and smells of the same GoogleTV shortfall. This situation, in which I do not actually blame Google, but the world of greed and music copyright scramble for profit we live in when everything is filtered through the most profitable, strings-attached model (hmmm guess who), while the tried and true seem to flounder. Lets hope Google CAN come up with a solution soon, but their recent attempts in the news today for their Private Funding Online Entertainment...that is pathetic... I mean how far will this carry on, will be ever see the light of this wonderful Android Platform reach it's full potential or is this its Zenith."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Let me begin by saying that \"Lenny D's\" review, dated March 27, 2011, is very thorough and accurate - no need to repeat what he posted. I am writing this review because I find the Amazon reviews to be the best shopping advice available. Real user experience beats marketing and salesmen, hands-down! I hope I am able to help you make an informed decision:\n\nI have been wanting a tablet since the first iPad was released, but, having a decent camera and microphone were important to me. I thought the iPad 2 was for me - I have loved my 64GB iPod Touch for a couple of years, and thought the iPad 2 would compliment it well. I visited a big box store and played - wow!! The iPad 2 is a beautiful tablet. Sign me up! After discovering the poor quality of the camera, and the premium price tag, however, I decided to examine the Xoom on display at the same store.\n\nI had done some reading up on the new Honeycomb tablet, but had not held one.  I was immediately impressed by the responsive touch screen and fast processors. I did notice the weight difference, but felt that this was not too big a concern, as the tablet can be made to rest on my lap, or on a table. I'm not carrying it all day, like a phone. I like that the default position for the Xoom seems to be landscape, widescreen, which is mostly how I would tend to use it. Factor in future expandable MicroSD, Android updates, Flash support, lower price, what's not to love?\n\nI ordered here at Amazon, with the Motorola gel case and the Skinomi screen protector. This tool has been my constant companion since it arrived. My favorite uses are web browsing at the kitchen table [gets me away from my desktop]; checking e-mail anywhere near WiFi; reading Amazon.com Kindle books [I think this is a better option than the Google Books, but I do like the Google Books display options.] I really enjoy the TWIT.TV application. You Tube is fun. The Pulse News gadget is fantastic. And Google Talk works pretty well, though low resolution over WiFi [voice calls are outstanding]. If you like comics, you must try the Comixology application - it has a cool method of showing the entire page, or cell-by-cell - very fun and maintains the traditional feel of reading a paper book [After the \"investment\" I have in paper comics, I realize that future issues will never be worth much, so why not go digital?].\n\nBattery life has been pretty good. I have been home with a cold, so I have been spending all-day watching TWIT TV, and reading my Kindle book. Battery is about 1/2 at 5:30pm.\n\n\"But, Steven!\" you exclaim, \"You said there was 'room for improvement.\"  Yes, much room for improvement:\n\n- Let me start with my BIGGEST complaint! No NETFLIX?!?!?!?  Now there is rumor that NetFlix will only be available for Android devices specifically labeled as NetFlix ready, due to some DRM concerns. I hope this includes my Xoom via future updates. Hopefully this is just a rumor, and NetFlix is working on the application as I write this... Please?\n\n- Multitasking is a breeze with the dual processors and 1GB DDR2 Ram, but... when you open an application, it seems to stay open until you go though the settings menu to manually close it. This is an Android issue, not a Xoom issue. After a while, too many apps running will slow down the tablet. I try to reboot at least once a day. Android Task Killer applications aren't much of a solution - just as easy to reboot;\n\n- A lot of applications to tend to force close - lock up - from time to time, but this hasn't been too frustrating, yet;\n\n- I was wrong - the weight is a noticeable factor, though not a deal killer. I imagine that the iPad 2 gets heavy after a while. I like to prop the Xoom up against something while I read;\n\n- The 5MP camera is quite poor quality - I don't imagine that a software update will fix this, so don't expect iPhone quality pics. I think it is better than the iPad2's camera, and the Xoom does have a very strong dual flash, so, there are shots you may not otherwise have been able to make;\n\n- The iPad screen is much more brilliant than the Xoom, but the Xoom is still a beautiful picture, when the content is good quality;\n\n- App Store and Amazon Android App Store are full of Android applications, though there seems to be no way to tell which are designed specifically for the Honeycomb tablet. They all seem to run well, but you will find that many are sized for a phone's resolution, and not optimized for a larger tablet. I have not had any trouble finding the applications that I want to run on my tablet - though more will certainly become available, soon;\n\nPlease note that I don't use my tablet as a music player, except just occasionally. I don't need two music collections, and I can carry my iPod in my pocket. The speakers are decent for what you would expect, and same for the volume, but not music quality. There is a nice music library interface, but I have not set up any synchronization with my collection.\n\nTHE ACCESSORIES:\n\nThe Motorola gel case - It's ok. I don't really like the texture, a bit like a matte finish. I wish it had more of a bumpy texture, like my iPod case, to give me a better grip. It is very thin. Doesn't add much to the size or weight of the Xoom, but I also don't think it will provide any fall protection. This is really useful only to protect the case from scratches, in my opinion.\n\nThe Skinomi screen protector - I have installed many of the Invisible Shield protectors on lots of different devices. I don't use them any longer, because I do not like the slight tackiness, and the texture that these seem to add to the glossy screens. The Skinomi has a much nicer feel, very smooth, doesn't affect the screen responsiveness, and practically invisible, except... I waited patiently for about 5 days for most all of the bubbles to disappear. They mostly did, but several tiny bubbles remain that seem to be just air with a little moisture inside - these I expect will remain. They are not really noticeable when the unit is on, but if you are a perfectionist [guilty] you will be bothered. I don't believe that a 10\" screen protector can be installed by mortals, without a few blemishes.\n\nThanks for letting me ramble on - I don't claim to be a professional writer - I do love my Xoom and highly recommend it anyone who is tired of waiting, and want to enjoy a tablet, now.  Maybe I'll post some updates as I learn more about it. I think the Xoom is the best available, and, from what I read, the releases expected this summer don't seem to be much of an improvement."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have now had my Xoom for a better part of a week and a half and I have to say IMO it is still a beta product with a premium price. I am on my 2nd unit because the battery in my 1st unit would randomly go from 100% to 20% over a period of 15 to 30 min with no usage at all. The replacement seems to have fixed that problem for me.\n\nThere are a number of software bugs that need to be worked out it seems as well. I have experienced random crashes in programs and have sent no less than dozen such crash report notifications. I understand this is a rushed and unfinished OS but I think Motorola has really done a dis-service in trying to get this thing out the door. I don't mind being a beta tester but then again I don't like paying a premium for a product in order to do so.\n\nThe hardware is fantastic with the exception of the display. I realize the majority of people are used to looking at TN displays but I have always used an IPS display for a desktop. While the phones I use have had TN or VA screen to use such a display in a tablet and charge such a premium price is poor judgement on the part of Motorola.\n\nI'm still on the fence on keeping this device. I see its potential future but by the time the software stability and support finally catch up to its capabilities there will be much better hardware than the Xoom to choose from at the same or lower price point.\n\nUpdate 4/10/11: This morning I woke up to discover that my Xoom's storage was full. HOW? I have 43 apps installed and according to the installed apps log they should be taking up about 1.4 gigs of space. I checked the official Motorola owners forums and discover the only fix is to do a full reset of the device which means completely wiping the device. There is a thread about this on Moto's forum. They seem to be working on a fix but this just further justifies how BETA this product is. I bought this device for work and if I have to wipe it all the time it is useless. I am no longer on the fence this device goes back tomorrow.\n[...]"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Ok, so I will be the first to admit that I'm an apple dude all the way. I have owned every ipod, and every laptop from the ibook, to the powerbook, to the macbook and macbook pro. However, when it comes to the tablet experience, the iPad in all its greatness (I owned the 1st generation iPad) doesn't come even close to the the honeycomb OS. User ability, the xoom has more customizations to make it your own. The processing speed is amazing. It's literally like walking around with a lighter and more portable laptop, whereas the ipad is like walking around with a tablet. I will be the first to admit, that at this point, the iPad takes the throne when it comes to apps. However, just as we saw android start off small and work its way to the top, I see it doing the same with this OS. The Xoom has great hardware to work with. I will admit, it is slightly heavier than the iPad and the iPad 2. In the beginning, the \"on\" button can seem like it's placed in an awkward place (it's in the back), but because you get used to having it in landscape mode, your finger will naturally land on it. It does slightly suck that you have to have the case open to charge it. And the screen shows finger prints like it's no ones business, but that's nothing that a screen protector can't remedy. And the last con that I can see is that as it stands right now, the SD card slot doesn't read cards but they did say that they intend on releasing an update to remedy that situation as well. Battery life is a strong competitor to to both iPads. It has usb ports (something that neither iPad has). You can view flash on it!! Damned iPad and its refusal to put it on there! Honeycomb has it! Overall, this is a great hardware with a great OS on. Apple could learn a thing or two."}

My brother bought the ipad2 and we've done our own comparisons over the last couple weeks.  The xoom has all the esential apps in the amazon and android store I need and as more and more of them become retrofitted for the tablet, the better they look and feel.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "5th review 7/5/12...I use my Xoom every single day.  Last Christmas I put a motorola wireless keyboard and wireless logitech mouse (to be used together) on my Amazon wish list and received both of them for Christmas.  I did not use them (actually kept\nforgetting I had them) until last week (7/1/12).  Stupid me!  These are the greatest accessories to compliment your Xoom.  I find that using a real keyboard is a must have/helpful in some situations and wanted to try it out.  It didn't disappoint.  Using the keyboard when on facebook or typing a lengthy email is a great asset. It also came in handy while trying to choose\nsome actions where your fingers just won't work on the first try.  Using a tablet is great, but sometimes we wish we had a real\nkeyboard and this is the perfect accessory for this tablet.  So sometimes I have a tablet and sometimes it seems like I have\na laptop.  Either way...I love this accessory and it works like a charm.  The mouse and/or your finger works without having to\nswitch anything over. Just turn on the keyboard (or not) and the mouse (or not).  The beauty of all this, it all fits in my purse :)\n\n4th review 6/2/11....had another weird situation this time with my magazine/book subscriptions but before you think it was the Xoom...it wasn't.  This time it was my fault...stupid, stupid, stupid move on my part.  Going through my Xoom and exploring some apps that I had not previously explored and I came across \"Gallery\" full of my photos and many many magazine/book photos and artwork and magazine/book covers tons of them so I figured why do I need all this taking up my memory/storage space so I start to delete and delete and delete them, of course I thought maybe these needed to be there so I did a little test and the\nmags were still there that I had deleted...OF COURSE THEY WERE!! but with no artwork/photos left in them.  Arrggghhhh!! What\nhave I done?!  So after a hour of trying to figure the whole thing out I gave my Xoom to my gadget savvy husband and asked him\nto work on it.  After about 15 minutes he called Barnes and Noble and had a service tech help him out.  After a few tweaks they were able to redownload all my books/magazines and everything is back to normal.  So the reason for this embarrassing\nreview is to let you/anyone know to NOT just start deleting stuff from your Xoom unless you are certain you are NOT deleting\nimportant very much needed data....dummy I am :)\n\n3rd review (5/10/11)...had a bump in the road with my new Xoom :(  It locked up on me during the Honeycomb startup, have no idea why but there was nothing I could do and  the Motorola (help desk) could not help.  So after the disappointment and the wonderful support from Amazon (sending me a brand new one, it was still under the 60 warranty/return policy) I got over my disappointment because I love this product even though my first one hit a bump in the road.  While setting up my replacement I also learned some new things and lost ONLY the photos/videos I had taken with the Xoom (I never did save anything to my PC, so\nthat's my fault).  I was able to retrieve everything else (all apps, etc).  The more I use it, the more I truly believe I made\nthe right decision on purchasing this product.  Thank you Amazon for the quick response on my replacement (by the way) no questions asked.  Sorry I had to mention the start up issue, just in case others come across this. In reality things happen and\nyou can even purchase a $80,000 car and it could be a lemon....so hopefully there will be no more issues with my new Xoom.\n\n2nd review (April 2011)...after using the Xoom for about three weeks now.  Very very impressed...the other day I sad down to use my Xoom and didn't know what to do first.  There's so much to do and soooo many things to learn.  This just happened to me this evening and I had to update my original review because of it.\nWhen I first received my Xoom I went into my email account (through Comcast) and the website just wouldn't load right and there was flashing of articles and other stuff (videos) and disappointed I left that website and mentioned to my husband that it would not load right.....right away he said nooooo let me have your emails forwarded to your gmail account (which is used when you first use your Xoom). A bit disappointing that I couldn't use my normal email screen, but whatever I let it go.  Been using the gmail email only when using my Xoom.  BUT tonight I was updating my Xoom with my favorite bookmarks and low and behold I went into my original Comcast email just to see what would happen...WOW it adapted to my Comcast account I can access ALL my emails, folders, address book and more without the ads and crap that tainted my view the first time...I was so impressed I just had to mention it.  Adapting ...how spooky and impressive at the same time\n\n1st review(March): I'm not a techy, a young adult or a \"gotta have that\" type of person, just a housewife, a working mom of two children and in my\n40's with that said, here's my review:\n\nI have not used a Ipad of any kind or Android product...but do know many many people who have, all around me everyday and because of that and reading many reviews I went with the Xoom WiFi only.  What a great decision I've made.  This product is quality throughout.  Love how fast and accurate each move is and I've impressed the Ipad/Adroid(cell phone users) with my Xoom.  Brought it to work this week and didn't see it for hours.  Comments from my co-workers: \"Boy this is fast\", \"Look how sharp the screen looks\", \"This is really nice\", \"Oh, you gotta have Adobe Flash\", \"This feels like really nice quality\".\n\nMy decision to buy the Xoom over Ipad (which I came really close to buying) was because of the following:\nQuality\nAdobe flash\nHoneycomb technology\nProduct can be updated in your own living room (as updates come along)\nCan do just about everything a laptop can do, just smaller\n\nCan't wait to see:\nNetflix apps\nApps to allow printing (probably out there, but not sure yet)\nWhat new updates will come along\nWhat new games will come along\nWhat new accessories (ex: covers, cases, bags to help protect my Xoom)\n\nFavorite things about my Xoom:\nSize\nHow fast it is\nAutomatic updates on current saved apps\nTransferring my current personal email to the Gmail Xoom account automatically\nThe coolest apps:Disaster Alerts(around the world, Scanner (police,fire,emergency around the US), Radio app to listen to your favorite stations without actually going into each website, and many more.\nThe built in camera/video player.  Sharp and awesome.\nScreen size, better than viewing on a cell phone any day.\n\nAs new technology goes...Hi Xoom...whatever Ipad :)"}

The iPad might have a better interface and more apps, but I really wanted something more than a bigger version of my iPhone. Plus its nice experimenting with a new OS every now and then. I really like browsing the web, which is what I will use it for 95% of the time. It feels really good to see web pages like you would on your computer with Flash. So far I've been using it for 24 hours and I feel I have gotten used to navigating it. I'm pretty impressed with Android and how far it has come. I would have gave 5 stars if there were better apps and less bugs. But of course future updates should take care of that. I mean my first iPhone didn't have everything perfect right off the bat."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "From my original at [...]\n\nI've had my Motorola Xoom Android 3 (Honeycomb) tablet for about a week now. Because the non-Apple tablet category is relatively new, I'm writing up a review for my friends and colleagues who are in the tablet market. Starting right off with the grade: it's a B+, with expectations for improvement to A.\n\nDisclaimer: I have never had a Mac, iPod, iPhone, or iPad.... never cared to. My family has some of these devices by their choice, but I prefer Linux and other open systems. I own one of the original Nexus One Android phones from Google/HTC, and love it to death. (Reviewed last year.) Thus, most of the comparisons here will be between the phone and the tablet, not against another tablet.\n\nAbout the Xoom\nI bought the 32 GB, WiFi-only version that requires no carrier contract.  It came preloaded with Android 3.01, including Adobe Flash support. It set me back $599, the same as the 32 GB iPad 2, plus another $40 for a case I picked up a few days later.\n\nOverall Impression\nHardware -- The overriding vibe I get from this machine is \"Thinkpad.\" It's black, solid, has a fit-for-business feeling to it. Top end specifications all around.\n\nSoftware -- 90% done. This is the source of the B+ grade instead of an A. Like others in the core Android demographic, I'm pretty comfortable with prerelease software, and that's what this is; it has an \"almost there,\" release candidate feel. Since this is a \"stock\" Android device (not managed by Motorola or a carrier), it will get the updates when they happen, so it's fine for me. If you're less comfortable with that, you may want to wait 90 days for a Xoom or another of the pending Honeycomb devices (or buy an iPad).\n\nDetailed Review\n\nHardware\nThe Xoom is a bit wider, shorter, and thicker than an iPad. It weighs 1.6 pounds, which is about 4 ounces (which is actually 20%) heavier than an iPad or the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, which is scheduled for a June 2011 release. I can tell you, after a while using it, your hands get tired of holding it. Everyone I've seen with an iPad has a case/stand, so it may be similar for all tablets. After a trip to Toronto I went out and bought one too.\n\nThe processor is a dual core Nvidia Tegra 2 @ 1GHz. Feels very snappy, especially compared with the phone, which you would expect. The gyroscope/accelerometer, in particular, feel quicker than the phone.\n\nThe memory in this unit is 32 GB, which feels like infinity compared to the 512 MB in the phone. Like the phone, it has a MicroSD expansion slot which will accept up to another 32 GB, but it's not activated yet in the software. For now that's not an issue but the expectation for it was a major buying factor for me. I've wasted a lot of time managing apps on the phone to stay out of the \"low memory\" zone, either by deleting them or (when possible) configuring them to store data on the MicroSD card.\n\nThe display is a 10.1\" widescreen (diagonal measurement). I really like that size, and it's why I waited on the first generation Samsung Galaxy. In this regard I agree with Steve Jobs, a 7\" screen would be just too small for my tastes.\n\nThe resolution is 1280x800, which is a bit better than 780P HD (1280x760). I haven't managed to play an HD movie yet (see software section below) but Youtube HQ looks great on it. The stereo speakers on the back are also passable, equivalent to a top end laptop but not as good as separate desktop speakers.\n\nThe battery is rated at 6500 mAH. That's a bit less than the iPad 2 (6600 mAH) and Galaxy 10.1 (6860 mAH). What I can say is that it runs all day using the WiFi in the house. I do turn off the screen when I'm not using it (quick press of the power button in the back), and have it set to sleep after 30 minutes with no activity; that's the maximum setting and I use it because the IBM-imposed password is such a pain in the ass when turning it back on (see software section below). The battery isn't removable but that seems fine; my phone has a removable battery and I bought a spare, because WiFi/GPS/calls can eat a charge up before a travel workday is complete.\n\nIt has both front- and rear-facing cameras. The front-facing one at 2 megapixels is kind of \"meh,\" but the rear-facing 5 megapixel camera is very good. Its dual LED flash makes it a real camera replacement for snapshots. It's the same camera resolution as my phone, but previewing in full size, and being able to hold it with both hands, are big improvements.\n\nFor networking, it has WiFi (802.11a/b/g/n) and Bluetooth, both of which have worked flawlessly for me. It also has GPS, which is cool, but the lack of cellular support in this model makes that kind of limited since Android uses TCP/IP and Google Maps, rather than a preloaded dataset like a Garmin/TomTom etc. I can tether it to my phone but at that point I'd simply use my phone's GPS in its windshield mount.\n\nThe ports include a standard 3.5mm headphone jack on the top, and a set of connections at the bottom. One is a very thin, round power socket for the wall cord - which is very long so you can plug it in under a desk and run it up and over if you need to. It's got a standard mini-USB port, which is unique among the iPad and Galaxy tabs and was a buying factor for me. However, it also has the same wide/thin port as my phone (not sure what that's called), so I just plug it into my PC that way to load stuff. There also is a small connector that appears to be for a dock, which I haven't looked into.\n\nI held off on the case because reviews said it wasn't worth the 40 bucks, and on that point I agree. But it does fit very well, stands the tablet up at multiple angles, and frankly just gives peace of mind that I'm protecting the damned thing. It also looks pretty cool -- if you looked at it quickly you'd think it was a DayRunner or something like that. Very businesslike. One issue is that, while it has an opening across the back for the power/camera/flash/speakers, and on top for the headphone/MicroSD card, there's no opening for the connectors at the bottom. In practice this means that the case needs to be open for charging and connecting the unit. My theory is that it's because it's at the main case hinge and would weaken the case to the point where it might rip. Some posters on the Internet drilled a hole for the power plug but I'm going to try to live with it.\n\nSoftware\nHere's where my \"Mac-norance\" will show for many of my friends and colleagues. My daughter is a Macbook/iPhone person, and we have various iPods floating among family members. Me, iTunes makes my head hurt. Let me grant the point that Apple software is magical and wonderful and \"just works,\" because in my role as family tech support that has proved to be the case - and permitted me to stay Mac-norant.\n\nThe Xoom was the first tablet to ship with Android 3, also known as Honeycomb in Google's sweets-related naming schema. This is the version optimized for tablets, and came a year after the first iPad rocked the market and became a stunning success. Obviously, Google's hope is that it follows the same pattern as iPhone: Apple creates a market and collects massive profits through its closed ecosystem of software/hardware/distribution, then Google releases a free OS that various constituencies create products with, eventually outselling Apple, albeit with no direct profit to Google except having Google search/apps as defaults. All I know is, choice is good and consumers win either way.\n\nMy phone, purchased in January 2010, shipped with Android 2.1 (Eclair), and I've since upgraded it to 2.2 (FroYo, or frozen yogurt) and 2.3 (Gingerbread). Since 3.0 is not available for phones - and may never be, since it's tablet-focused - direct comparison is a bit difficult. Suffice it to say that the phone version is more mature and stable, since it has iterated more times.\n\nBut it's definitely the same underlying OS. The tablet experience is very much like the phone experience, with a few tweaks. The alerts are at the bottom instead of at the top. There are no \"hardware\" icons for back, menu, home, and search as there are on the phone; rather they are onscreen at the lower left. (The home icon actually looks a lot more like an envelope, which had me thinking it was mail for the first day or so.)\n\nThere's the same five panel layout, where the center panel is what you see first and then you can swipe left or right for additional panels. With extra real estate, you can now look at the icons for available apps in the lower half of the screen, and drag them directly to a representation of the panel you want in the upper half. Even with bigger icons, it seemed impossible at first that you could fill up all that space, but then I discovered that widgets - which actually take up TOO much space on the phone -- are ideal for the tablet form factor. Things like the Google search box, music player, book reader, etc. are much more useful on a tablet, and let you essentially use apps (or at least a subset of app features) without launching them.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when I got the Xoom (and it was a real \"wow!\" moment) was when I gave it my Google login. All the apps, WiFi settings, and preferences from my phone showed up. Apparently those clever devils at Google had been backing everything up for me and had it ready to apply. What this means is, when I bring the Xoom to friends' houses, or an IBM location, or my daughter's college, or anywhere else I've connected to the wireless network, I'll just go online automatically. (That's especially impressive at IBM because it's a LEAP connection.) I felt a smile cross my face at that moment.\n\nI still had to install the apps (except the stock ones), but they were there in my apps library ready to go. Even the ones I had deleted from the phone to make space were still there. Now when I get an app from the Web it asks me which device; and if I get it from one device it adds it to the library (without installing) on the other.\n\nManaging the apps is a very similar experience. The stock app manager gives you a way to configure your apps from a list, and of course you can still configure apps from within them using the menu entry. I have an app called Astro that I bought for the phone (even purchased apps can be used on multiple devices without additional charge), which gives a better app management experience, and lets me inspect running/installed apps more easily.\n\nThe Google apps are very well done of course. Gmail, Maps, Google Talk are buttery smooth. Google Voice is great because you can actually make calls from the tablet, even without cellular service. Gmail has a multipane layout where you can see folders and messages at the same time; much more like a full Web experience than a mobile one.\n\nSimilarly, the updated camera application is much better and easier to use, and the Gallery app (which now hooks directly to Picasa as well) presents a very integrated experience. After loading all my photos on it, everyone in the family had a blast swiping through the different albums.... even though they were on the shared PC in the den all along.\n\nIn fact, that's probably the most jarring shortcoming of the current situation. You can use any Android app on the tablet, but many of them are still optimized for a small screen. The NESN application is merely a big list of story headlines, just as it is on the phone. Other apps are worse, they refuse to use the whole screen at all and just sit lonely in the middle of the page. Even Boston.com, which is actually a Web link, sees your mobile user-agent and opens as a mobile app. You have to browse all the way to the bottom and click on \"full site\" to get something useful - and it still leaves an annoying bold \"Click here for the mobile site\" link across the top of the page. You can expect this situation to be resolved over time as more apps get \"tabletized,' but in the meanwhile it's definitely an irritant.\n\nAs noted above in the hardware section, I haven't managed to play a movie in HD fullscreen yet. The only format support I can find so far is .m4v and .mp4 and I don't have anything in that format. I converted Ferris Bueller last weekend, just messing around, and it played fine but didn't use the full screen. I redid it with different settings and it filled the screen but was stuttery and not synched. At this point I'm presuming user error but haven't had time to get back to it. As mentioned, Youtube HQ looks great, and my hope is that more standard support for things like DiVX and AVI will be added in the future, or made available in an app.\n\nThe browser is a bit of a gap at this point. The built-in browser is a cut-down version of Google Chrome. It's quick and renders faithfully, and it even synchs with your desktop bookmarks and tabs. However, it does not yet support add-ons, so for example no Adblock/Flashblock means you're once again looking at the ugly blinky Web, not the optimized sanitized one. I installed Firefox, which does support extensions, but it's dog-slow at this point and doesn't have all the features I like in the desktop version, especially RSS folders in the bookmark bar. Again, expect improvements here.\n\nOne big positive is that my main IBM collaboration programs work really well. Notes and Sametime for Android are native versions that rock out. On the big screen they're even better. Our Web-based apps all work too, including LotusLive meetings and LotusLive Symphony editors. Symphony lets you edit collaboratively, in real time, and you also can use the \"assign sections\" feature the same as from a desktop. You can't yet present in a Web meeting but you can participate; this is the same limitation for Linux on the PC that I bug people about constantly.\n\nThe big gap at this point is regular office productivity programs - I use Symphony full time but there's no MS Office or OpenOffice either. Not that you'd want to use a touchscreen for a lot of document creation (although there is a wireless keyboard available), but for light editing it would be handy. I don't know what's available on the iPad in this category, but it definitely feels like a gap right now.\n\nThe one big downer about using Notes on the tablet (and phone) is that IBM security policies make you password protect the device, so when I wake either one up I have to enter a complex password before I can do anything. Obviously that's much easier on the tablet than the phone, where my fat fingers often take two or three tries.... If possible I'll just hand it to a nearby kid to unlock, which of course defeats the whole purpose. Not an Android/Xoom issue so probably outside scope here.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of the tablet form factor is that the built-in Book Reader application and the Amazon Kindle app become very usable. I'm reading a Civil War history now and it's quite natural.\n\nSpeaking of Amazon, my very favorite thing about Android these days is the new Amazon App Store. To promote it, they're giving away a free paid app every day, which lets you try things much more easily. I got all the Angry Birds apps (which are amazing on a tablet), finally in the ad-free versions. I also got the Shazam music identifier app (which I had previously purchased anyway) and the Soundhound app which does the same thing as Shazam only much better (as Joel Demay demonstrated to me at Lotusphere).\n\nConclusion\nAs a geek, honestly it was a bit painful to wait for a tablet I could use. But I'm very happy with this choice. This Xoom hardware should easily last me through this generation of the technology - 2-3 years I figure. The software will improve quickly (as it already has for my phone).\n\nGoing forward, I will declare with certainty that an Android tablet is a useful thing to have in your technology inventory. It fills a gap between phone and laptop, and already gets a lot of use in my household. It will be interesting to see just how that trend goes over time, but I expect it to remain at least stable; this does not feel like a novelty but rather a very natural extension of my computing style.<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MOTOROLA-XOOM-Android-Tablet-Wi-Fi/dp/B0045FM6SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MOTOROLA XOOM Android Tablet (Wi-Fi)</a>"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I technically give this product 4 1/2 stars, but because of the rating system on Amazon 5 will suffice.\n\nSo the big controversy is should I buy a Motorola Xoom or an Apple iPad? I obviously chose the Xoom and here are my reasons why.\n\nFor $599 I get better hardware than the similarly priced iPad2 32gb version. For example, a dual core Nvidia Tegra chip which runs at 1ghz vs the A5's 800mhz per core. Superior front and rear camera that can record in HD and has a flash built in as well as digital zoom ( along with a nice toggle for lighting options and video/photo effects ). A higher resolution screen. A built in HDMI out and access to my files stored on the Xoom without having to use extra software ie iTunes. Strong and resilient Gorilla Glass. And the option to use different file formats, namely flac and avi through apps in the marketplace.\n\nThe Operating System on the Xoom is more of a user interface than iOS is and Honeycomb has been around a month, while iOS is almost at 5. I can switch between different tasks effortlessly on the fly and the browsing is phenomenal compared to Safari on iPad. I've got 5 \"deskspaces\" that I can customize to my liking and everything feels smooth and natural. The virtual keyboard is very good, but I suggest that you purchase a thumb keyboard...it makes things flow that much better. ( I feel one step closer to the computers used in Minority Report ). Also, Flash support!!!!\n\nIt does need more apps, and I mean Honeycomb Android specific apps. Although, that's not primarily why I purchased a tablet, it's something the detracts from the whole tablet experience when considering the general consensus.\n\nI feel like the Xoom and the iPad may both be tablets but when I think of what I want in a tablet, the Xoom is closer to what I have in mind.\nFor the record I do own an iPad as well. It's good, but I like the Xoom better."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "There is finally a true tablet OS, not a frustrating implementation of desktop OS (think UMPCs) or an inflated and over extended phone OS (iOS/iPad, Galaxy Tab, and other android 'tablets').  It's really impressive to see and use and feels like a new OS, just one that's based on the Android we all known (and love).\n\nThe implementation is good, remarkably good for a brand new OS that only really exists on one device (officially I mean, we know you can stuff this on a Nook).  It's far from perfect, but again it's very nice for a first shot.  There are bugs, but nothing show stopping (the music icon pops up again and again long after I've stopped playing it) and nothing that shouldn't be resolved in due course.  There are some shortcomings with the software (the browser is jittery and more than a few websites only load mobile versions [I know you can enter debug mode or use another browser, but I don't want to do that all the time and I don't care for Dolphin or Skyfire], there seems to be a lot of blank/white space in the applications that might be better used, and the widgets start to look weird on non-blue backgrounds [notice most of the ones included are blue]) but again, they should be worked out and improved in time.\n\nWhere it falls in this particular implementation is mostly hardware.  I'm not a fan of the fingerprint and dust magnet that is the screen (it's really terrible).  Also, the screen just isn't that good.  It might be fine compared to some cheaper laptops but it gets incredably washed out at higher brightness and has only \"OK\" viewing angles.  I'll note that I'm more sensative to these things than other people, but I'd really like to see one of these with an IPS screen (like on the iPad). (-1 star)\n\nPersonally, while the device is nice, it doesn't fill a need or purpose for me.  To me a tablet should be more about entertainment and creating a more personal experience than I can get with laptop.  This, for the time, just fails at that.  Part of it is just the methodology used here.  Each time I use the tablet for something that's truely unique to it (say versus my iPad or my Nexus S) I feel I'd just rather do it on my laptop for a better experience.  I've found a use for my iPad and specifics for when it's best (e.g. curling up in bed to watch netflix when a phone would be too small and a laptop too noisy/cumbersome/distracting), but I haven't with this.\n\nI guess the obvious reason for that is just lack of applications that I want in a tablet.  There's no Netflix, no Hulu, no working version of Pandora, etc.  These should be solved eventually, but there's no timeline for this from any of those companies. (-1 star)\n\nWhile I know some may argue that it's unfair to judge a product that is fresh out of the gate and that software will come, the issue is that new hardware will come as well.  There's also the issue that due to different hardware and such hulu or netflix may never come to this specific device (Hulu has stated 'select devices' for whenever they get their android version out, and netflix seems to need specific DRM capable hardware as far as they're claiming now - this could change, but who knows).  With quad-core Tegra chips coming late fall, rumors of a Nexus tablet, and whatever else happens in the next 6 months, I have to judge what a product is based on what it is now or will be in the immediate future.  Maybe Netflix and Hulu will put out android versions, but it may be another year and a much better tablet.\n\nI still think this is a great product, but it's just not for me.  Baring the screen quality (again it may not bother you as much) this is a really solid device.  If you need a lightweight and portable device this is a very solid and viable alternative to say a netbook.  But as my friend commented \"If one gets Netflix, I might get one.\"  I kind of have to agree with that."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "This tablet is excellent. I actually use it daily. At first my plan was to use it at work, on the road etc. Now, I take it everywhere and if I forget it I will go back home for it period. Sure, the device isn't perfect but nothing is for that matter. Give it time and updates will come. Alot of users are displeased with the non active SD slot however the memory on the device will hold until this update comes along. Right now I have everything that I use daily on my MAC available on my XOOM (including 15 movies as well). This device will only get better. The App store is growing overnight. Give it time and I'm sure we will see some state of the art apps real soon.\n\nThe OS is nice. You can't just pick the XOOM up and do more than basic functions without learning the OS first. However, you will be fine in a week or so. Make sure you get a decent file manager like ES File Explorer, the stock browser is actually pretty good. Very easy to use I love it. Most people will go with Dolphin browser as a replacement. Which will allow you it do some really cool things. Get a copy of PrintShare this app will allow wireless printing it sets limits on what you can print however it allows a decent selection of options. Pick up either Documents to Go or QuickOffice Pro HD believe me you will use it. Make sure you buy a screen protector, carrying case, and car adaptor (really nice when using the navigation app) .\n\nWell I hope this helps.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I am sure a lot of you are wondering, what's right for me? iPad2 or Xoom? This review isn't going to list battery life, camera comparison, and all the other spec related stuff, because, there are a lot of other reviews out there like it. Also, personally, I think it really boils down to what type of person you are and what you intend to use it for.\n\nOf course, these are just my personal views, but hopefully it should help you decide what's right for you. So here it goes.\n\n--\nIf you are a \"reader\" type:\nI recommend the iPad2.\n\nThe iPad2 has a more standard(closer to 4:3) ratio, and it's main mode is portrait mode. Naturally, reading books and viewing magazines are perfect. And there are more e-Magazines out there for iPad2 than for the Xoom. The only exception is if you like reading manga(comics). The Xoom's wider screen ration allows you to view 2 pages at once in landscape mode. It works out quite nicely if you set your zoom setting to fit width.\n\n--\nIf you are a \"multimedia\" type:\nI recommend the Xoom.\n\nThe Xoom's main mode is landscape mode, and it's screen ratio is definitely more wider than the iPad2. This makes it perfect for viewing videos, but it makes it slightly less than ideal for holding it in portrait mode to view magazines and such. In addition, although not supported naturally, you can get free apps from Android Marketplace to view multiple formats of videos like DivX, Xvid, and such. If you have non-standard videos (as in, not bought from iTunes), or if you like to watch foreign animations with subtitle files (SMI/SRT), Xoom is definitely the way to go. You won't be able to do this on the iPad2.\n\n--\nIf you use Flash a lot:\nI recommend the Xoom.\n\nFlash does not work on iPad2 and it probably will never support Flash. If you (or your family/kids) like to play web-based Flash games, or frequently use websites loaded with Flash, iPad2 won't cut it. Xoom is the way to go.\n\n--\nIf you buy all your stuff from iTunes already:\nI recommend the iPad2.\n\nIt is easy to rent/buy movies/music on iTunes, and Apple does make it easy. Although you can still copy and play all the stuff you bought from iTunes (unless it's DRM-protected) on the Xoom, if you like the way your iTunes work with your current Ipod, iPad2 might be better for you.\n\n--\nIf you like Fancy/cool stuff:\nI recommend the Xoom.\n\nTo be honest, the iPad2 interface is easy, but very boring. You just get a bunch of icons. And more icons. And even more icons. Which you just click to run programs. It has been like this since the first iPod touch. On the other hand, the Honeycomb OS (Android 3.0) on Xoom is great. It's got different styles of widgets you can put on the background, showing you real time information at a glance. It's also very fun to interact with these. Honeycomb is a platform specifically targeted for tablets, and it does it well.\n\n--\nIn short, if you like to read and love using iTunes and buy a lot of stuff from iTunes anyway, iPad2 would be better. However, if you are more multimedia oriented and like to view different types of videos and want the flexibility of Flash support, Xoom is the way to go.\n\nAnd if you decide to get the Xoom, I also recommend getting \"Tablet Keyboard Free\" from Android Marketplace. It's a free keyboard with split screen keys, which allows you to type with your thumbs while holding the Xoom. The paid version is in Amazon Appstore as well -&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Tablet-Keyboard/dp/B004TNLY4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tablet Keyboard</a>\n\nBoth iPad2 and Xoom are great devices, and they both boast high speed dual core processors with large display screen. Battery life is good on both devices, and I really think it's less about \"which device is the better device\" but more about \"what do you want to do with your tablet\".\n\nLastly, as for comparing this to other Android tablets, the Xoom beats all others hands down. If you are going to get an Android Tablet, definitely get the Xoom. The Honeycomb OS (Android 3.0) is much better than other earlier versions of Android (Froyo and such). At the time of writing, Xoom is currently the only tablet with Honeycomb. Hopefully my review helped you make up your mind =)"}

Android had a few advantages over iOS in the phone world (notifications being a big one), however in the tablet space, Android just feels right.  Widgets were a bit of a gimmick on a phone, but having them on a tablet is great... I can see my most recent e-mails, the song that is currently playing, my browser bookmarks, and so much more... a little configuration and everything I want to see or quickly access is right there in my face. :)\n\nI'm not going to drag this out, I just want to say that so far I'm loving my Xoom, and Honeycomb is a great step for mobile computing!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Why should you buy the Xoom Wi-Fi rather than the iPad2? If you read this review, you are looking for an answer to this question. Furthermore, I venture to guess that you are an early adopter, a risk taker and a \"techno maven\".  Otherwise you would have taken the advice of your family and friends and purchased the iPad2.\n\nI have owned my Xoom Wi-Fi for 2 weeks and am impressed with its technology and delighted with my purchase. Beware that the marketing and advertising budget of the Apple iPad dwarfs the miniscule budget of the Motorola Xoom. And don't waste you time asking the friendly salesman at Best Buy to help you choose. Let me outline several of the thoughts which went into my purchase of the Xoom:\n\na. Price: I paid $599 for the tablet. This price is not significantly different from a similarly equipped (32GB) iPad2.\nb. Keyboard: Neither the virtual keyboard of the Xoom Wi-Fi nor the iPad2 is good for heavy duty word processing. I will do my word processing on a computer with a keyboard.\nc. Operating System: The Android Honeycomb operating system works fine; probably no better or worse that the iPad2 iOS for the average user. There are many more APP's for the iPad2, but this could change rapidly.\nd. 3G vs. 4G: I don't really need a cellular connection and don't want to pay a monthly fee for something I seldom use. When I travel in the USA I may use my cellular phone as a Wi-Fi hot spot. When I travel outside the USA I may rent a Mi-Fi device.\ne. USB Port: The iPad2 does not have a USB port. The Xoom Wi-Fi has a micro USB port which should allow me to hook it up to remote devices including my cameras. But this will need to wait until I purchase a female-to-female or a micro-to-female USB adapter.\nf. Browser and YouTube: There appears to be little difference in the functionality of the internet browser between the iPad2 and the Xoom Wi-Fi. But the Xoom Wi-Fi can display programs which need Adobe Flash. An icon facilitates voice-to-text entries reducing the use of the keyboard.\ng. Size: The iPad2 is lighter and svelter, but the Xoom Wi-Fi still fits easily in a backpack or briefcase.\nh. GPS and Google Maps: The Xoom Wi-Fi functions as a standalone GPS. The iPad2 lacks this function on its Wi-Fi only model. To get this, you need to buy the more expensive 3G version.\ni.  HDMI Output: Both the iPad and Xoom have HDMI output. The iPad needs the optional Apple Digital AV Adapter and the Xoom needs an inexpensive micro HDMI cable.\nj.  Case: I am trying the ZooGue case which received great reviews. The case has great utility but adds to the weight.\n\nThese tablet computers are awesome. You will own one sooner or later."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I received my Xoom one week ago, and have been rather impressed. I was previously the owner of a Viewsonic G Tablet, which is a similarly spec-ed Tegra 2 device, though without Honeycomb and possessing a significantly inferior screen.\n\nOverall, I'm extremely impressed with the device. The screen is excellent, especially compared to the Viewsonic. Viewing angles are quite good, and the 1200x800 resolution is fantastic. Honeycomb is great to use, and really does seem to be a good attempt at using the increased screen real-estate more effectively than a smartphone. There are a few nitpicks I have with it here and there, but overall the software experience is quite good. Most programs run fine, though there are a few out there that either crash immediately, or are poorly programmed on the developer's end, resulting in a sub-optimal tablet experience.\n\nMy favorite addition to the Honeycomb interface are the new widgets - particularly the email and calendar widgets. It seems like a rather minor thing, but if you're using your tablet for actual work instead of entertainment, having quick access to your inbox and messages can make a large difference. The two-pane Gmail application is likewise a big step up from Froyo/Gingerbread. The new notification system is also very appreciated for those using the tablet for actual work, though I think I personally preferred the notification system on WebOS when was using it.\n\nThere are a few minor gripes I have, however. First, there are the general issues with the microSD slot not working on release. I'm an early adopter and can deal with things not being at 100% when they're released, but I do generally expect minimal functionality on the hardware. More annoyingly, as an engineer, this seems like a problem that just shouldn't be that hard to fix.\n\nAlso, I've experienced a couple of troubling application crashes in apps that should be rock-solid (Market, Camera, Google Talk while video chatting). I understand a random game written by a third-party developer crashing my system, but I would expect Google-written apps on a Google branded platform to perform flawlessly - or at least not lock up so badly that they force a hard reset of my system.\n\nOverall, I'm extremely pleased with the Xoom, but a) I think it's a bit expensive compared to some of the other Honeycomb tablets that should be hitting shelves over the next month or so and b) I'm a bit disappointed that some seemingly easily fixable bugs are taking this long to squash. That said, I was willing to spend the extra money to get the full \"Google Experience\" and receive updates sooner than anyone else. Unless that is something important to you, or you need a Honeycomb tablet right now, my advice would be to wait a month or so and see what other options are available."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I had really high hopes for the Motorola Xoom tablet and Honeycomb operating system.  Unfortunately, both failed to live up to expectations.  Not only does the fit/finish of the Xoom feel cheap in comparison to the 1st gen iPad, the overall poor user experience from the jerky refresh rate during screen swipes to the impenetrably confusing interface gives new meaning to 'wtf were they thinking.'\n\nThe only saving grace of the Xoom tablet has to be the integrated tabbed browsing, and even then, there are multiple apps w/tabbed browsing available within the iPad app store so no big deal.\n\nI really wanted to give the Motorola Xoom tablet a high review, but given the overall poor design and consumer experience it is a mediocre product at best especially considering the premium price being charged.  With products like this it's no wonder so many American companies like Motorola fair poorly against competitors abroad."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have to admit that I was in the camp of people that just didn't 'get' tablets. They seem more expensive and less useful than a netbook...\nNow I get it.\nThe Xoom is a joy to use. It's so much more personal than a 'personal computer'. It's always on. It's always ready to entertain. This is the device we reach for by default at home now.\nSetup was a breeze. Honeycomb is fantastic. The notification system is the best I've ever seen or used. At first I was baffled that the navigation/notification bar didn't go away in full screen apps such as movies or games, but now I get it. You don't want to stop what you're doing just to see what a notification was. This makes that possible, and it does so elegantly (the icons fade away to dim dots when watching movies or playing games, so they're not distracting).\nThe browser is great. I love the chrome like start page which shows most visited sites (turn it on under the labs setting in the browser). Browsing is smooth, and extremely capable. Try streaming Amazon Video On Demand. It works great!\nThe only things that I don't like about this device is the speakers, which face away from you, and are usually muffled by a desk or lap, and the volume buttons, which are hard to push, and seem superfluous in a button-less world of Android 3.0. For some reason volume control was not included in the quick access settings you can get to from the notification window, and it's an omission I'm sure will be fixed in an update soon. It just makes sense to be able to change it right in the interface.\nOverall though, the Xoom is an amazing device. It's taking all my will power not to get a second, as my wife and I are constantly stealing it from each other."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "The Xoom is NOT perfect, but if the measure is the iPad then the Xoom WiFi is the best tablet on the market. I've had the iPad since November and got the iPad 2 the day it came out. I sold it last weekend because I was disappointed ever since upgrading to the \"new\" iPad. I LOVE Apple (own a MacBook Pro, iMac 21.5, Apple TV, and an iPod - my wife has an iMac 27, an original iPad, and an iPhone 4), however, for my phone and tablet I am sticking with Google.\n\nFrankly, I'm tired of people rating the iPad high because of the Apple on the back and apps. Reviews are correct when they say the comparisons between the two aren't fair. At $599 you get (above and beyond the iPad):\n\n-1GB of memory\n-Real front and rear cameras 2 & 5MP respectively (the ones on the iPad are almost useless)\n-Real widescreen\n-Amazing resolution (1280x900)\n-HDMI connection (without a $40 adapter)\n-MicroSD slot (for future use & expansion)\n-Full Customization\n-True Multi-tasking\n-FLASH, FLASH, FLASH!!!\n-Legit 12 HR battery (have heard individual experiences differ)\n-Most important Open Source Platform!\n\nCons:\n-Very reflective screen (iPad is as well, but Xoom slightly worse)\n-Apps are lacking (compared to iPad)\n\nLet it be known Honeycomb is NOT a cell phone platform - It's TRUE dedicated tablet software! My wife's iPhone and iPad are identical (except for size). My Droid X and Xoom Tablet are completely different (in feel, functionality, power, and performance). I LOVE THAT! I found out I don't want a GIANT PHONE - I want a TABLET! However, my wife loves that her iPad is the same as her phone, loves the simplicity, loves the uniformity. If that's how you are go with the iPad. If you like a true, powerful tablet experience then look to the Xoom."}

Received it in excellent condition and well packed.\n\nI have been using it daily since 3/29 and I am very pleased with it.\n\nPros:\nOS - Android Honeycomb - the first real tablet OS is great and will only get better\nHardware - Excellent quality - built tough\nScreen - Great screen.  Sometimes I do turn the brightness all the way up\nWidgets - I use several screen widgets and they all take advantage of the screen size\nApps - All the apps I used on my phone work great on the Xoom and the ones built for tablets are great\nCameras - High quality cameras. Decent shots and video but won't replace a camera\nFlash - after a short download/update, Flash is working great on all the websites I visit\nPrice - $589 for a 10 inch 32GB tablet running the latest OS is pretty good\n\nCons:\nCrashes - rarely happens but once in a while an app will close and I have to re-open it.  Probably will be fixed in the next update.\nSD Card - It would be nice if the SD Card slot was working but I haven't even begun to fill up the internal space and do not even own an SD card yet\nVideo Software - could be better.  I suspect they are going to improve it or leave it for a third party to develop a more robust app\nWeight - I wish it was lighter\n\nI chose the Xoom over the iPad because Honeycomb is more like a real OS and not just an app launcher.  I like the flexibility it provides so I can configure and personalize the OS to my needs. I also like the open environment of Android.\n\nSoon, more tablets will be out and there will be many choices with all kinds of screen sizes and price points.  The same thing will happen with Android tablets that happened with phones, once you get all the different manufacturers each making Android tablets, the number of apps will explode and tablet market share will belong to Android."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I would like to mention that i had to read a lot defore deciding to purchase this tablet, i read the reviews for the Ipad2 and this particular item and i saw that the ipad had this tablet beat in all of the categories [supposedly].\n\nI went to an apple store to see the ipad2 in action and it just felyt like a big iphone to be honest, the device was to light and to flimsy for me to consider it a stable machine, i asked the clerk if they had any in stock and he mentioned that they only had floor models and none in stock for sale. You have to make a line outside the store before they open for a change to get one.\n\nNow im not a super high excecutive, but making customers wait in line for a product feels more like marketing than acctual demand.\n\nI read that hardware wise the xoom and ipad2 had almost identical procesor speed, memory and storage (wifi) so i took the plunge and purchased a XOOM from amazon.\n\nThe device is a little more heavy than the ipad and to me thats good, since i can see the main diference in the screen/touchpad, the XOOM feels more sturdy, more made for a work enviroment where it will get moved arround a lot, someone said that the screen was made from gorillaglass, i don't know that is the case but it does feel more strong.\n\nI was talking to apple customers and reading apple users say that the apple-appstore is the best thing since sliced bread and that you can get tousands upon thousands of apps. But really i don't need all that crap since this machine will be used for work not enterteinment. I use the built in email client that syncs all of my emails from diferent companies via exchange, pop3 with no problem. I use a few apps that i need, ( Quickoffice, SugarSync, Evernote, amazon kindle reader, and LogMein-Ignition)\n\nThe XOOM feels phenomenal, it does what i want it do do with no problem, i can remote in to my servers with the Logmein-Ignition app for andriod and it works wonders.\n\nNow fast forward a few days and my boss gets an ipad2 and we sit down and compare. Well guess what ipad2 feels cheap and light, the XOOM has it beat hands down in my opinion, my XOOM feels more like a bussines tool than a toy. I love the XOOM's lower taskbar thingy that is always on, the ipad2 has an all screen approach and my boss had a lot of trouble closing a big spreadsheet, no problems in my XOOM, since you can always go back or to main menu and them close the app thats running wild, no easy way to do this on the ipad2\n\nMy boss wanted to get the ipad going and guess what, he downloaded the same apps i use on my XOOM from the same developers, so much for apples touted super app store.\n\nThe XOOM user interface was done by someone who knew how to make a very user friendly interface, i like it more than the ipads hands down, its excellent for what you can do with it.\n\nI love the XOOM so much that im going to get my wife one first chance i get.\n\nI know people say honeycomb is buggy and all that jazz but i have yet to see a problem with my device that i could not easly fix.\n\nIf you like beign a sheep by all means go apple and worship steve, ipad is a good product, but so is this XOOM and i feel i can have more options in android than in apple."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "There have been a lot of negative things said about the Motorola Xoom. I have read just about all of them. I have read that the Xoom is made of cheap plastic and has a poor screen with horrid viewing angles. I have read that the battery life is horrible due to the use of the Flash plug in. I have also read that the Xoom is big, clunky, has an unstable OS, it is buggy and crashes more often than not. When the Verizon 3G version was released, I was reminded over and over again that the $799.00 price tag was complete suicide and that the Xoom was officially dead on arrival. . I know there are a lot of you that are on the fence about whether or not you should buy this tablet, and at $599.00 for the Wi-Fi version,  it is not a decision to be taken lightly. If you go by what has been said by biased internet bloggers giving reviews after using the device for only 5 minutes, it is easy to understand your apprehension. So as a proud owner of this tablet, I feel compelled to write this detailed, objective review, so that you will know the truth at least, and hopefully I can offer some guidance and tips to help you get the most from this very powerful tablet. I have to admit that I was feeling a bit skeptical, but something told me to go to a store and see for myself if the negative things being said were true, and I am glad I did. When I picked up the device, even before turning it on, I was absolutely stunned by the build quality. Although the tablet is made of plastic, it does not feel cheap by any means. The screen has a really smooth buttery feel to it and it is easy to scroll with your fingers. There is no flexing of the tablet and it has a very solid, almost military spec build quality. I remembered thinking that Motorola had actually over done it with the build quality. This tablet features Gorilla Glass by Corning and a screen protector is unnecessary. Although I don't want to test this, it feels as though the Xoom could survive a fall without breaking. When I turned the device on, I was wowed by the HD quality of the screen. There are no viewing angle issues. In fact, if I lay the Xoom flat in my hand, I can still read the text on the screen. There is no light bleed or leaking from the corners, or anywhere else on the screen. Text is very easy to read, and games look absolutely incredible.  At this point I understood why the device was so expensive. You definitely don't get the feeling that the price is unjustified in this area. At that point I knew I had to have this tablet, but I wanted the Wi-Fi only version. From my experience with the 3G version of the Xoom I was actually surprised that it was discounted to $599, and I feared that this version would be made using cheaper materials to meet the lower price point. When I received it from Amazon, I am happy to report that the only difference is that the back cover is a dark metallic silver versus the all black Verizon 3G version and the lack of a 3G radio obviously. Everything else is the same. There have been negative reports about the Honeycomb OS being buggy and unfinished, and besides the lack of SD card support until a future update, nothing could be further from the truth. The first charge took about 45 minutes. I booted the device and went to the market and downloaded Flash 10.2. The scrolling is smooth and fluid. There is no hesitation, or glitch. My device has never rebooted or crashed. The first charge yielded a full 16 hours before I needed to recharge it. A quick visit to the android market and I downloaded ROCKPLAYER. It is a video player with a codec list that will play videos in virtually any format without any re-encoding needed. Just connect the Xoom to your PC, drag the videos to the video folder in the Xoom, and hit play. Copying large files to the Xoom is very fast, about 2 minutes for a 800MB file. The Xoom has a mini HDMI port with a true mirror function. Just connect it to the HDMI port on your television, and everything on the Xoom is displayed on the TV instantly. There is another media server app called PLEX that works brilliantly on the Xoom. It is a 2 part app. The first half is installed on your PC. Register an account, and set up a share folder. The second part is the Android app for the Xoom, which you must download from the market. It costs $4.95. Once you install on the Xoom, and connect, it streams all music and video content from your PC to the Xoom, provided that your PC is on. You can set up port forwarding through your router, and stream content to the Xoom from anywhere in the country over Wi-Fi. And speaking of Wi-Fi, tethering the Xoom could not be easier. As long as your Android phone is rooted, you can download a free app from the market called WI-FI TETHER. Once you set up the password on the Xoom, it is stored permanently in memory and the Xoom will automatically connect each time you activate the tethering feature on your phone. I tried this just this past weekend while on a trip in the car. The Xoom connects very reliably and surfing was fast and a non-issue. The native browser on the Xoom has some kinks to be ironed out and because of this, I don't recommend using it. When surfing websites, it still tends to land you on the mobile version of websites. There are instructions to enable desktop spoofing , but the browser \"forgets\" these settings each time you close it. The solution is to download the very capable and free DOLPHIN HD browser from the market. Most android users use this browser anyway. It is one of the best android browsers, hands down and many will argue that it IS the best. It features tabbed browsing that rivals a desktop, has \"on demand\" flash to allow you to only see the flash content you want to see by clicking on it, and numerous add-ons and skins to customize it. It even has a PDF reader add-on that will allow you to read PDF documents directly from the web in the browser. On the second charge, my Xoom yielded an astonishing 26.3 hours! That was watching 2 full length movies, hours of surfing the web, and playing games on the device. There have been complaints about the volume and power buttons. I can attest that the power button located on the back of the device is in a well thought out location, but you would have to actually use the device for longer than 5 minutes to realize this. When you pick up the Xoom, your left index finger sort of naturally falls where the power button is, and after the first day, you will be actually thankful that it is there. The volume buttons however I find to be a bit annoying. They are over engineered meaning that they feel like they will last for 100 years, but because of this, they are kind of hard to push in. Adding to the annoyance, they are slightly recessed, making them hard to locate by feel.  As far as Honeycomb goes, I find it to be a straightforward, well thought out layout that will take only about 1 hour to master. There are things that are different from Android 2.2, but once you learn the differences, you will actually appreciate it more. Now although the Xoom is almost perfect, perfection is elusive, and with the positives, there must be negatives, however in this case they are temporary negatives. Firstly, the micro SD slot is covered by a pullout tab, that when pulled out, reveals a plastic dummy SD card, that I recommend you pulling out and tossing immediately, lest you soon lose the pullout tab. The dummy SD card is a little oversized and thus kept pushing the pullout tab out from the tablet. If not for careful and constant pushing the pullout tab back into the Xoom, I know I would have lost it by now. Getting rid of the dummy SD card solved the issue. We can fault Google all we want but it is the 3rd party apps that are the problem. Downloading the Nook E-reader app was successful, however it force closes every time I try to read a book. Pandora does not work at all at this point however they are working on an update. Fring does not work, however the TANGO video chat application does, although with some minor issues with the cameras being upside down in portrait position. People love to shout from the mountaintops that the Xoom only has 16/53/100 apps depending on who you ask. Well you should ask someone like me, because I actually have one and can give you a definitive answer. The truth is when you visit the market, all 60 thousand or so apps show up on the Xoom. There is a tab that you can click which will feature the official \"tablet optimized\" apps, but that does not mean that none of the other tens of thousands of apps won't work perfectly on the Xoom. Perfect example: The CNN app is not listed as a \"tablet optimized\" app, however it looks absolutely stunning on the Xoom and scales to the large screen like it was written for the Xoom. It is just hit or miss right now. Most of the apps that I have installed are not \"tablet optimized\" but they look just fine. So don't believe everything you read about this apps thing. Trust me it is only going to get better. If any of you have used windows 7 you will understand this next part perfectly. Remember when you had to make sure you had all of the drivers before you did a new install with XP? And the first time you installed windows 7 and it did all of this automatically? Well that's how Honeycomb sets up your device thee first time you register your market/Gmail account. The Xoom automatically installs all of you previously purchased apps and then updates them. Without you even realizing that it happened. There is a full syncing customization menu in Honeycomb that will allow you to select all aspects of account syncing to tailor it to your needs. Tapping on the clock, opens a quick menu that allows you to select screen brightness, Wi-Fi toggle, screen orientation lock, and other settings at a glance eliminating the need to install toggle switch widgets. If you scroll down further, you can open the full settings menu to gain access to more detailed settings and functions. Motorola kept the GPS radio on the Wi-Fi Xoom in spite of the deletion of the 3G radio, so all of the functionality is still there. Google maps and Google navigation are already installed, and as long as the Xoom is tethered to your smart phone, it functions exactly like the 3G version. Download another free app from the market called WHERE and it will take advantage of the GPS radio immediately. WHERE will update your location automatically, and tell you every restaurant, attraction, movie theater, and gas station within a 30 mile radius of your location, Not only can you see the movie start times of all movies directly from the device, but thanks to Flash 10.2, you can watch movie trailers in full HD right inside the app. In summary, It is simple. If you were worried about the build quality, screen viewing angles on the Xoom, I can attest that the things you have read are complete lies, and I give the Xoom a 10 out of 10 in this area. If you were worried about the OS being buggy and unfinished, I can tell you that other than the lack of micro SD card support until a future software update, then that is also another lie. Yes, there are problems with some 3rd party apps not being compatible with the device. But we all know that this is going to change soon. I really hope that this is not the only argument that the Apple camp has against the Xoom because if it is, then Apple is in trouble, if not now, surely not too far down the road, because the Xoom and the Honeycomb OS have already proven themselves to be so much more advanced and far ahead of the iPad. And once these minor issues with 3rd party apps are ironed out, along with the micro SD card support, the Motorola Xoom is going to be a force to be reckoned with. I really hope that you find this review helpful in your purchasing decision and if any of the above issues were keeping you on the fence, then I recommend you jump off now and hit that add to cart button."}

I won't get into the whole adam fiasco too much but after waiting 2 months I got a defective unit, it took another 6 weeks to get my replacement. I was no longer interested in it after almost 4 months so I bought the xoom. I really love Honeycomb and the build quality. Here are a short list of pros and cons for me personally:\n\nPros:\n-1200x800 resolution, very nice screen\n-very solid device\n-Honeycomb\n-hdmi output\n-battery life is insane\n-tegra 2\n-2 cameras\n-GPS\n-Bluetooth\n-saved $200 by getting the wifi only model\n-browser is great, very similar to chrome with the tabs\n\nCons:\n-internal storage does not mount usb in ubuntu(main problem for me right now)\n-screen gets smudged way too easily(ordered screen protector from sgpstore.com, awesome screen protectors)\n-no full usb 2.0 host(although it can be enabled with a minor hack and an adapter)\n-sd slot not active yet(update coming soon to enable i hope, would really help with my ubuntu problem)\n-power/wake button is on the bottom so you have to lift the xoom up every time you want to wake it up(minor)\n-price tag still too high even for wifi only\n\noverall I really like my wifi xoom. I have never owned an ipad so I can't compare it to an ipad like people like to do so often. with all the bad luck I've had with tablets lately I was fully prepared to be returning this within its 14 day return period, if it was too buggy or I was very unhappy with it. I'm happy to say that right now I plan on keeping it and am very happy with it. I would just advise people that are looking to get a tablet to pay the extra money and get a tablet approved by google rather than a budget tablet that you will most likely not be happy with."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I wanted to buy my wife something nice for our anniversary.  She likes to browse the internet, play games, and manage her emails.  But she doesn't like the bulk of the dell laptop she has to lug around,not to mention the slow performance and software issues we recently had with it.  So I went down to our local office supply store (sorry Amazon) and purchased the wifi version last weekend. Let me say that this thing is awesome.  The OS is super responsive and the internet is blazing fast.  Setting her email up was easy and it ties in nicely with the Google calendar she already uses.  Maps are beautiful and Angry Birds is crazy fun!\n\nI was a bit worried that she wouldn't get the OS because she is used to the iPhone, but she got it right away.  And it was nice that I was able to link my droid x marketplace apps to the Xoom.  She hasn't complained about the weight of the unit and the power button location has not been an issue.  The only complaint I have heard from my wife is that the volume buttons are a bit stiff.  After I used it I would have to agree, but it seems like that is the only gripe we have.  Heck, I am even starting to look for it on my downtime so I can play with the unit!\n\nNow, this is just my review of the Xoom and I won't get into how it compares with the iPad2 because I don't own one. I am sure it is a fine product, but the Xoom meets our needs and does everything we would like it to.  I guess the only thing I can say is that price point and availability somewhat contributed to my decision.  Overall, we are extremely satisfied with the purchase.  I just cant wait for the marketplace to get flooded with tablet optimized apps!\n\nUpdate 1 - Flash works beautifully on the unit.  I was able to watch the latest episode of Fringe without any problems.  And the speakers sound incredibly clear as compared to my laptop.  You just have to remember to download Flash from the Android Marketplace and you're set!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I recieved my tablet early afternoon from Amazon and I have to say it's everything i've come to expect from motorola. Granted it's brand new, but Honeycomb is a solid OS and features items you've come to expect from a browser. There are the typical things that do come with new items, like app manufacturers need to catch up, but i'm not worried about that. The majority of the apps I've used with v. 2.2 on my Incredible work just fine and the Documents to GO v3 works beautifully as well.\nMovies, Music show and sound excellent and the tablet itself is a bit on the heavy side, but it's SOLID! Personally, I don't have an issue with that and appreciate what this thing can do now... and WILL DO later. The next firmware update will enable the Micro-SD slot, but it does have 32GB of space on-board which is plenty for now. Afterall... it's not designed to carry everything on a power-user PC, but carries enough to keep me busy while out and about.\nAll in all... I am one happy camper I waited for this to come out."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "After waiting on the perfect tablet for over a year (ever since Apple announced the original iPad), I finally bit the bullet on the WiFi Motorola XOOM. [Note: I bought this from a local retailer as I just wanted it morning of release.]\n\nI had previously owned the original iPad in the fall of 2010, and enjoyed it for the first 48 hours. However, the issues became glaring - no great Google Talk options, so-so Gmail support, and the browser just felt half-useless due to the lack of flash. I decided to return it for a refund, and waited for a proper Android Tablet.\n\nWhen Google finally announced Honeycomb on the XOOM, I knew that this device could fit my needs. Obvious perfect integration with all of my Google apps (Gmail, GTalk, Reader, etc.). Add a useful homescreen with widgets, Adobe Flash 10.2 in the browser, and true multitasking, and we have a winner!\n\nXOOM Hardware: This is a quality device from a build quality perspective. No creaks, it has a solid build, strong buttons, and a great screen that has been proven to have Gorilla Glass. The screen itself is responsive, and I can grasp the XOOM in portrait mode in one hand fairly easily. The battery life - awesome. I bring this tablet to work with me at 730am, and use it constantly (hooked up to wifi). I then use it at home in the evenings, often while watching TV. At the end of the night (11pm), I usually have 30-40% battery life left! I'm very impressed with the battery life, and it has really exceeded my expectations. I've been playing with it a LOT this past week as it's my newest \"toy\", but the battery has really proven itself. However, the one issue with the XOOM is the weight - it's not extremely heavy, but it is noticeably heavier than the iPad 2 and obviously a much heftier device when compared to something like the 7\" Galaxy Tab (although that's to be expected). Given the fairly sizeable battery and 10\" screen, I think it's a decent trade-off, and nothing that I would consider a deal-breaker.\n\nAndroid 3.0 Honeycomb OS: Coming from an Android device (HTC Evo) and having owned iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touches, I love Honeycomb. Everything from the widgets on the homescreen to the Google apps like Gmail and GTalk work great, and are exactly what I wanted in a tablet. The best thing about Honeycomb is the browser - it's truly similar to the desktop browser Chrome, and has a lot of options that one would expect in a desktop-class browser. The tabs stay present at all times, Flash 10.2 works great (some hiccups here and there on flash-heavy websites), and there are even Google's famous \"Labs\" features (swiping from the sides allows you to perform basic function in a pop-up half circle; refresh, forward/back, bookmarks, settings). However, I have noted a few bugs in the software; Honeycomb force closes (when your app \"crashes\" back to the homescreen)frequently. I notice about 3-5 force closes daily, typically in the browser when looking at flash-heavy websites or sites with a lot of images. Also, The homescreen itself experiences some force closes (might be a bad widget I have installed, I haven't thoroughly investigated yet). Also, the homescreen takes a while to refresh when switching from portrait to landscape and vice versa if you use a lot of widgets. Something to be expected, but takes longer than a 1ghz dual-core processor with 1GB RAM would suggest.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with my purchase and enjoy using the XOOM everyday. There are bugs to be ironed out, but I'm confident that Google is working out these issues as I type this review. I'm giving it 4 stars - half a star off for the extra weight, and half a star for the \"beta\" Honeycomb OS. But overall, I don't regret my purchase at all, enjoy it immensely more than the iPad I used to own, and I would recommend this to anyone that's looking for something that's almost as powerful as a laptop running Windows 7."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "UPDATE 1/16/2013: I just wanted to write a quick update. Everything I say below is still valid but when I refer to iPad in my review I am talking about the iPad 2, the current model is the iPad 4. Both the iPad 3 and 4 have retina displays which crush everything else on the market in terms of pixel density. Compared with the current best 1080P Android and Windows 8 tablets the iPad 3 and 4 still has 1 million more pixels. Compared with the Xoom the iPad 3 and 4 has 2 million more pixels. As I kind of mention in my review I like Android but I really buy tablets for the screen. I find that the higher the pixel density the better a tablet works for my uses. I currently use an iPad 3. I would also add that quite a bit has changed in terms of software and capabilities both for Android and iPad since I wrote this review. Again, I still feel what I say in this review is valid, but it is only valid when you consider the time it was written. Technology moves fast and a lot has changed in less than 2 years. Thanks to everyone that has read, commented on, and hopefully found my review to be helpful.\n\nWhen I first got the Xoom about a week ago I turned it on and I really wasn't blown away. I use lots of devices, and my first impression of the Xoom just wasn't stellar. However, I could see the potential, and so I kept using it, I got some apps, I started to learn the interface and the depth of the features.\n\nSometime during day 2 of using the Xoom it really hit me. The Xoom and the iPad are like chess and checkers. When you first start playing chess (or trying to use the Xoom, in my amazing analogy) you feel overwhelmed and confused. You can't really do things smoothly, you don't understand the options, it just is not a great first impression. On the other hand, your first game of checkers (or using the iPad) is probably going to be pretty smooth. It isn't complex, most all the options and concepts are obvious and easy to understand and your first game is going to be pretty similar to your hundredth.\n\nHowever, as you start to understand the Xoom (or chess) it really starts to grow on you. You understand what you can do, how to do it, the amazing depth and possibility in the device. While the iPad (or checkers) players are still having roughly the same experience time after time, with the Xoom every day of experience with the device makes it more powerful and enjoyable to use. In the end, the Xoom becomes a much better device than any of the competition; it just takes some time for you to learn what it is capable of and how to make the most of it.\n\nAs you can tell from the last three paragraphs I wasn't exactly impressed with the Xoom to start. I wasn't even sure it would replace my current device for most things. However, by day two I started to really \"get\" the device.\n\nThis first happened when I needed to look over and annotate a PDF someone had sent me. I downloaded it from my email, and was able to actually put it in the Xoom memory where-ever I wanted in whatever folder I wanted. Wow, that is kind of cool, can't do that on the competition. Next, I was able to open it in a PDF reader, using this fancy program (which I easily found on the marketplace). I went through and did what I needed (with an amazing free hand drawing tool, it was a snap!), then I jumped back over to email, attached the newly edited PDF and sent it away. Now maybe I just never tried hard enough, but I don't think that is possible on some of the competition. That freedom to download files, do what you need, and then send them away again. On the iPad apps I have used it always requires the files to be in something like Dropbox, which is fine, except it would have made what I did impossible without using a computer.\n\nAnother \"WOW\" moment came when I wanted to get some ebooks onto the device. Now, on my Apple products this is generally a pain, you hook the device to the computer, go open itunes, you go to a certain tab, and a certain area, and a certain feature, and if you do it all right you can drag your ebooks over to the reader. It was rather simpler on the Xoom. For the ebooks I had on my computer I just dropped them in Dropbox, then I downloaded them on the Xoom, and using the Xoom file manager I easily moved them into a new \"Books\" folder I made in the Documents folder. Fast, quick, and simple and done on the device, rather than on the PC.\n\nHowever, what really blew me away was when I wanted some ebooks off the web. Using the regular browser I was able to just download them directly from the internet onto the device. I then used the file manager again and simply moved them to the right folder. This really did impress me, my tablet was uncoupled from the PC, I could browse the full web, download things, and then make use of them all without ever needing to tether to my computer. I was hooked.\n\nWith my new excitement at not requiring my computer to use my tablet I headed over to an Android App development forum. Here developers had posted lots of cool apps that were in beta or that they wanted to promote. On competing devices the only way to get an app is through the sanctioned and controlled portal, not so on Android (and thus Xoom). Using the Xoom browser I bounced around the forum, I downloaded beta apps, and then I was able to easily install them. Again, this is all on the device, and these were not approved apps, awesome.\n\nAnother example of something that impressed me came on my third day with the device. I was using the CNN app (which is free and tablet optimized, go check it out) and I watched a video of a story that I thought was really interesting, but it was one of those that is only a teaser, and the rest is on another site. When I hit these videos on my iPad I just have to try to remember to watch them later on a computer, because they are inevitably flash based. Not so on the Xoom, I typed in the address, the flash loaded up perfectly, and I was watching the video in full screen with no trouble.\n\nThis process of growing more comfortable with the device and learning what it could do continued over the last few days. At every turn I would find something amazing that just wasn't possible on competing tablets. I discovered the glory of widgets (custom little desktop things to show you the weather, or news, or whatever). I found some live wallpaper (moving animated wallpaper, that can change and adapt to things, such as the weather). I just kept finding new awesome features and uses.\n\nOne thing I want to touch on that is perhaps more technical than the rest of my review is the screen. I use my tablets to read, I started using ebooks a while back and I found tablets to work pretty well for that. I do most of my reading at night before bed, so the backlit screen is actually helpful versus a traditional reader. Anyway, one of the things that has always bothered me about the iPad as an ereader is that the pixel density (that is the number of pixels (or square blocks of color) in each inch of screen space) is very low. The iPad has somewhere around 130PPI (pixels per inch). It was so low that it really did give me noticeable eye strain to read on the device, I could see the pixels, and it really just wasn't a great reading experience. This was so pronounced that for the last few months I had actually been doing most of my reading on a 4th generation iPod Touch. It had a smaller screen, but a higher pixel density.\n\nAnyway, the Xoom has a very noticeable increase in resolution and pixel density. With its higher resolution it has roughly 33% more pixels than the iPad, roughly 300,000 additional pixels. This is something you can see immediately when looking at any text. It is a lot smoother and easier to read on the Xoom. However, the other side of this is that the iPad has a different display type, that does have better viewing angles and color/contrast. In my case I don't really care, I find the pixel density to be 1000 times more important than small color improvements or viewing angles but I feel I should mention it.\n\nMy point in these last two paragraphs is that the Xoom is a much better device for displaying text than any of the lower resolution competition. If you are looking for a tablet to read your newspaper and books and websites on, then you definitely should give the Xoom or other higher resolution tablets a look. In my opinion the resolution on the iPad/iPad 2 just does not cut it for text.\n\nWelp, this is really starting to get long, so I guess I should wrap it up. I know this isn't like the usual review you read, but I really wanted to give people an idea of the experience of using the Xoom versus just giving the facts and the breakdown and the comparisons. The Xoom is a device that improves exponentially the more you use it. After a few days of use I really can't imagine returning to the constraints and frustrations of the competition. However, on my first day I wasn't that impressed, so be sure to stick with it and get used to it. Now I am off to make dinner, and to accompany me I am going to take my Xoom, which is streaming live video thanks to the wonderful inclusion of flash, the competition is going to stay sitting on the shelf (probably for the foreseeable future).\n\nI just want to mention that I am giving the Xoom four stars because it is not perfect. As a reference after using the Xoom I would probably give the iPad / iPad 2 three stars. There are still improvements that can be made to tablets. I really feel like Android and Xoom are on the right track, but this is still not what I would call a perfect tablet, it is just the best that is available right now (for my uses).\n\nI hope someone finds my review helpful, feel free to ask any questions you may have in the comments."}

I have had an HTC EVO since July 2010 and it remains rooted.  I love the phone and have been so pleased with the Android platform.  I own stock in Apple, AT&T, Google, and Sprint--I only mention that to demonstrate that buying an Apple device or an Android device offers no difference in financial outcome for me.  I base my personal usage on my preferences as to look, feel, and the appeal of an interface.  I have dear friends and family members who are Apple devotees and I spent hours playing with their various Apple products, especially the iPhone and the iPad.  I am a woman with small hands and slender fingers, so the feel of a device and any associated fatigue factors are important to me.\n\nI have not had any forces closes or reboots.\n\nPros:\n\nALL the apps that I had purchased for the EVO installed on the Xoom with no additional cost.\n\nI love the Honeycomb OS.\n\nI actually prefer the look and feel of the Xoom to the iPad.  I have not seen the iPad2, so I can't speak to that.  I like the screen of the Xoom better than the iPad.  It looks like a sheet of obsidian glass. The Xoom's response to moves and clicks is smooth and impressive--I preferred it to the iPad.\n\nCons:\n\nFingerprints are an issue, but, I bought the Boxwave capacitive stylus to help with that and I love the stylus.

So I decided to take a leap of faith abd buy the WIFI Motorola Xoom-- and contrary to some of the negative online reviews, the Xoom has exceeded my expectations.\n\nSome reviews have described the Honeycomb operating system of the Xoom to be buggy and difficult for layman to understand. Well, as a person who's not a true tech geek, I have found the Xoom very easy to use and operate. I like how Xoom is tighly integrated to my google account.  My google email is right on the desktop; I can see Google calendars very easily; I have Google maps with GPS, which is awesome.  I have Google photos -- it's awesome seeing a slide show of all your photos.\n\nI was able to place DVDs of some of my favorite movies onto the Xoom.  It's very enjoyable watching DVDs in bed.\n\nI'm a student, and it's great to put PDFs from scholarly journals into the Xoom.  The color of the articles blows away my Kindle.  Now I can see pictures in PDFs with clarity.\n\nAs for apps, the android market and the amazon market have plenty of apps in my opinion. I downloaded this app where you slice fruit with your hands -- my wife and I spent an hour playing the game last night.\n\nThe battery life is very good.\n\nThe only thing I'm trying to figure out is how to project the Xoom onto a projector so I can use it at work to give presentations."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I own both.  I bought the iPad2 the day it came out... and I bought the Xoom just a couple days ago.  The iPad2 is sexier on the outside for sure.  In typical Apple fashion, it is wrapped in its packaging and hardware like Art.  The Motorola Xoom packaging is lackluster and the visual aspects of the hardware side by side with the iPad leave a lot to be desired.  HOWEVER, the Xoom's Google Android Honeycomb Operating System is far superior to the iPad2's iOS.  So much so, that the iPad2 when you use it \"feels\" old and outdated next to the Xoom.  Unlike other Android touch pads I have played with, the screen slides real smooth.\n\nFortunately, I am in a position where I can own both.  However, if you are trying to decide between which to buy, it largely depends on if you are a mac fan.  If you are, then the iPad is the way to go.  Regardless of how much better I tell you the Android Honeycomb Operating System is on this Xoom tablet, it will not matter.  But, if you are not a mac fan and looking to choose the best device for the money, without question, at least right now, the best is the Xoom.\n\nMotorola got it right.  Good job guys, finally something that competes and beats the iPad.  However, work a little bit on the design of the outer shell... it could use a little more sexy like the iPad2."}

Its raw power and processing capacities make it a great contender.  The flash technology to view iPads is that little Xfactor that some shoppers are looking out there and possibly holding back on the iPad.  though the iPad is like every tech freaks brain ambrosia, the XOOM is the tablet for all those Apple haters (not too many any more), those that like the Andriod OS, the new Android over all followers and every one who is looking for something different.  It is however sad that the tabled also resembles the iPad on the cost side.  Considering that a Tablet has less power than a PC it is sad that one can still consider a PC and get a decent portable experience with a cheaper notebook.  If the XOOM was cheaper on the WiFi side, it would be attracting a greater market and making serious competition against the pricy iPads."}

Even when i did drag some avi, xvid movies over and try to play them using several android apps it sputtered and dragged. i was informed that the software upgrade that allowed me to utilize my ext memory wasn't available yet so it was usless. Even when i bought an micro usb to female usb adapter it still wouldn't allow me to use even my flash drive. That was a definite deal killer for me. So after 1 day of owning it i returned it back to amazon. Ideally for all it does and doesn't do it's not worth 599.00 more like 399.00. But it's blazing fast surfing and the camera is great too but i'll think i'll either wait until the price drops or something with usb support comes out."}

I literally use this device each morning to check the news, stocks and my e-mail daily to work. the battery performance is outstanding and i cant believe how long it last throughout an extremely heavy use. i only wish the micro-sd card was enable out of the box. This is literally a device that can stand on its own without being tied to a cord! the construction of the device seems to be well built and durable. motorola did a great job!!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I really love this thing. It's blazing fast, and more a desktop OS unlike the IOS. It's funny how they\ntry to compare the Android 3.0 honeycomb OS to the IOS. They are nothing alike. In my opinion, the Ipad is just\na big iphone. The honeycomb OS is more like a desktop OS, which is what I like."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have played with my Xoom for multiple hours and would just like to share my experiences really quick.  The tablet is super responsive and I haven't noticed any lag in switching through screens.  I used it a lot from switching between a Facebook app (Flow) and the internet (Dolphin Mini).  I tried the YouTube app out for a little bit as well and it worked well.  I still have to test audio and videos a little more.\n\nThe only downside I noticed was that audio, when maxed, it just a little low but it isn't a huge deal.  Watching a movie by myself will be fine.  Another thing is that it is just a little heavy.  I am sure after a few weeks of heavy use my hands will be pretty muscular :).\n\nOverall, I'd give it the extra star when more tablet specific apps come out."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "It is an awesome tablet. Incredible battery life easy to carry smaller profile then the I pad. Definately on of the better purchases I have made. It has a couple of issues like playing videos makes the tablet restart but nothing that be fixed with a software update. Other then that no problems with the tablet it is still new I didn't expect it to be perfect it is motorola's first stab at a tablet and in my eyes they have truely pulled it off. I give this tablet a million stars. Also what is nice unlike the I pad if you turn it portrait it is still small enough to use the keyboard with your thumbs. Which is really nice."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I cannot say enough good things about the Xoom, but I am already an Android devotee so I am pretty much the exact person this device was made for.  I chose to purchase the WiFi only version since I already have a data plan with Verizon for my Motorola Droid that I can share with my Xoom via a wireless tether app that's available in the Android Market (the wonders of root access!).\n\nWithin hours I was playing Mario Kart 64 via a N64 emulator with perfect controls on the screen of the Xoom.  At that moment I knew that I had made the right decision to purchase the Xoom.  All of the built in games are amazing as well.  I can't say enough good things about the Xoom already and I know that there is so much more to come.\n\nI haven't noticed ANY bugs with Honeycomb itself.  I noticed that the Craigslist app I have would force close occasionally while running in the background, and a handful of apps didn't take up the full screen.  So some apps may not be 100% perfectly compatible with Honeycomb yet, but that will change quickly.  The vast majority of apps seem to already support the Xoom.\n\nThe browsing experience is mind blowing.  It's the best browsing experience I've ever had.  Flash support is PERFECT.  There is no way Flash is a dying technology after seeing what it can do on the Xoom.  I tried the game \"Magic Touch\" within my browser and I was totally blown away by how well Flash is integrated into the Xoom.  The iPad can only be looked at as a children's toy, and the Xoom is the tablet for the refined adult (with some tech skills)."}

With that said the Xoom seemed to be the first honest challenger to the apple iPad. The next thing i knew i was at the Verizon store taking a leap of faith that this device was ready. It has wowed and amazed people as i educate them about this soon to be common place device that is simply amazing"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have had my Xoom for two days now and I am absolutely thrilled with it. I'm very impressed with the design of Honeycomb. Having an OS that is designed specifically for a tablet, rather than a phone, makes for a wonderful experience. It feels more like I'm using a desktop than a phone. I can't wait for more tablet optimized apps to be released.\n\nThe Chrome browser on the device is great. It offers true tabbed browsing and syncs your bookmarks with your Google account. Some sites detect it as a mobile browser, but it's pretty easy to change the user agent so that it appears to be a desktop browser.\n\nThe Xoom is very fast and multitasks like a champ. Video, music, browsing, games.., it all works perfectly.\n\nI am very happy with my purchase and would recommend the Xoom to anyone looking for a tablet."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "So far I'm extremely happy with my new Xoom. The screen is beautiful, the touchscreen sensitivity is just right for me. The Xoom has a very solid, quality feel to it. I love the size of the screen. Can't wait to watch some movies on it!\n\nI thought the price was very reasonable for what you get. Heck, you can pay more than this for a smartphone that's tiny in comparison.\n\nThis is my 1st experience on the Android OS, and I found it very easy to use. I've also been downloading apps like crazy. The speed of everything I've run so far has been very good. My Kindle and my Nook apps are now sitting happily side by side on my main window. I think it will be good for reading once I get a case. The text was very clear and easy to read.\n\nSpeaking of cases, I'm waiting to get my case from ZooGue so I can feel more comfortable leaving the house with the Xoom. I don't really have anything good to carry it around in at the moment. A little to big to fit in my pocket...\n\nOf course this is a very early review since I just got it this afternoon. I'll post more as my Xoom and I get to know each other better.\n\nUpdated 5/21/2011 (yes I'm still here, anybody missing? :-). Just wanted to let everybody know that I'm sticking with my original opinion. Still extremely happy with my Xoom, more so everyday as I find ever more useful apps and uses for it. My desktop PC is starting to get lonely, though it does get some attention when I use WYSE PocketCloud RDP to log on to it. It seems to be getting relegated to the role of a server.\n\nI've gotten my ZooGue which is great not only for taking the Xoom on the go, but also for use around the house. I've also added a pair of MOTOROKR S305 BT headphones for listening to music; the speaker docking station for use in my home office and to throw video to my monitor; and the basic docking station for my desk at work. I'm happy with all of these as well; though somewhat perplexed about the lack of a USB port on the docks.\n\nAnybody try hooking up an external hard drive yet now that Honeycomb 3.1 is out? I've got 3.1, but haven't tried hosting any USB devices yet.\n\nUPDATE: Over 2 years now, and I still love my Xoom. Its only gotten better with each new Android update. Still running strong. Battery life is better than when I bought it."}

The video formats supported looked very appealing. Well that excitement vanished as soon as I saw the HD video playback performance. The Xoom may support many formats but what good are they if you must re-encode your videos to get acceptable performance? The Xoom requires a very specific encoding and even then playback is not stellar. At its best, it is noticeably less fluid than the iPad 2. With the exception of flash based sites showing video, I have yet to have issue with the iPad 2 when it comes to viewing videos online or videos I copy over to it.\n\nFlash Support !!  Yes I was all excited when I heard the Xoom would have support.  You quickly find out that its not that important. My daughter plays several online flash based games.. none of which would run on the Xoom. They would load but that is about it. It immediately became obvious that the Xoom is only capable of very light flash content and that flash support is extremely over rated.\n\nApplications...  I knew this would be an issue on the Xoom. There just are not that many and when they do show up they are unpolished. I found games to run and look great. I was really excited when I saw the air hockey game on the Xoom, especially after playing head to head Air Hockey with my daughter on the iPad 2  in the store, but again was let down quickly when it was single player ???  I was also excited about the first video player app that supported Tegra 2 acceleration but if you have seen my YouTube video you already know that outcome.\n\nDuring the first week of use I experienced no real issues with the Xoom other than its lack of performance but again that changed. During my video shoot for the review of the first video app to support Tegra 2 I had a random reboot. This continued to happen on a random basis from that point on. I also had browser crashes start and increase. Perhaps that has been cleared up with the latest update.\n\nThe Xoom will have its supporters and most of them will be those that like tinkering. They like figuring out that you need this app to change this so another app can do this in order to get another app to do what it should have done to begin with :)\n\nI suggest a google search.. \"48 hours with the Motorola Xoom\" and \"Motorola Xoom HD Playback Issues\". If you do a little research you will find the Xoom requires the most basic form of HD encoding in addition to a lower bitrate to play with minimal issues, but even then it is not perfect nor does it match the iPad 2 HD performance.\n\nIts seems my decision to return my Xoom and wait to see if HD video playback was improved was a good choice. I see that complaints about HD performance have increased and it seems the Tegra 2 may be at fault."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "As with many others I have spent a great amount of time researching about IPAD2 WIFI vs. XOOM WIFI.\n\nI ended up choosing xoom, and I am impressed with this product.  Here I would like to share my thought process as well as impression.  So anyone in similar situations as I was may be able to use this for guidance.\n\nFirst of all, I own tablet pc x 2 with most recent one purchased back in November 2010.  I also own itouch.  Never owned android product.\n\nQuick background for the reason I needed/wanted new tablet\n\n- Longer battery life: My tablet pc only lasted 5 hours\n- Lighter tablet: My tablet pc weighted 2.5 lbs\n- Bigger screen: My tablet pc had less than 9 inch screen, which was great for comic reading but not so great for work related document reading.\n\nWork related\n- To watch multiple work related video series\n- To read ebooks.  Some of which are not straight off kindle nor nook market, but rather converted books from other file formats such as chm or saved web pages.  Some of these files are huge in size (up to 200MB) and contain multiple images, tables, and applied CSS.\n- To view Microsoft Office files.  Some of these files are relatively large in size(over 10MB) with multiple images, textbox, and smartart.  These need to be accessible even when there is no internet connection.\n\nPersonal use\n- To read digital comics\n- To watch streaming videos.\n\nHere are are my opinion about xoom wifi version so far.\n\nPros\n1. Watching videos\n- Works very well without any lag or stuttering. Screen resolution is a bit higher than IPAD2, but doubt it is significant enough to be noticible.\n- One great thing about xoom is microSD support (not available yet).  As I need to have multiple DVD sets with each being 20+GB, rather than deleting/reloading videos here and there, I can simply have dedicated microSD for each DVD sets. Currently, the highest storage capacity of microSD goes upto 32GB.  If I had gone to IPAD2 route, I was going to go buy 64GB for maximum storage capacity, which may have been sufficient by itself but 32GB alone will not.\n\n2. Ebook reading\n- My ebooks are not typical.  They are in epub file formats.  Even on PC, only couple applications can render these files correctly.  On itune market, using itouch I could not find any application that can render my ebooks except Stanza, which came very close for one ebook, but clushed on the other and ibook came very close with the other book, but did not show any images on the one opened with Stanza.  So together was able to provide close to perfect solution. *Supposedly, ibook does not render images if they are within the table.\n\nOn my xoom, I tried pretty much all the epub reader on android market.  None could render my files except one application, which actually rendered both books with complete original style and layout.  Minor issues are still there in this application such as bug with internal hyperlink.  But this is the best epub reader I have tried so far among pc, itune, and android market.  Just in case anyone is wondering, it is called StarBook.\n\n*Reason I said best and included PC here is two applications on PC that renderes my files correctly actually takes longer to open the epub files for some reason.\n\n3. Reading Digital Comic\n- Not to say much here.  Works perfectly.  Certainly, should work as greatly on ipad2.\n\n4. Watch streaming video\n- Flash 10 has been installed.  All the streaming video sites that I visit works just as on PC.  Definitely better than PS3 web browser.  However, I have read somewhere that playing Flash based games on xoom have significant lags.  As I don't play Flash based game, this was not an issue for me.  But Flash for Android Table OS is still beta version, so considering it is better I am sure many issue will resolve with final version.\n\n5. Customizability\n- Very impressive.  In fact, this is the one main reason that I suddenly became fan of android os.  It takes some learning and definitely not as Apple customer friendly interface.  But once you know how to customize this, you can basically make it into exactly the way you want.  Widget is awesome feature just like windows 7 widget, but seem more appropriate in tablet setting.  For instance, CNN widget updates highlight news every hour on my home screen without me clicking on the application.\n\n6. USB Connectivity\n- This can be both pros and cons.  But for me this is under pros.  As I just simply like to be able to drag and drop files, and be able to create my own folder organization.\n\n7. GPS\n- Surprised to see built in GPS.  Have not really played with, but apparently there is a way to have voice direction navigator using google map.\n\nCons:\n1. Weight\n- Main negative for xoom here.  According to the technical specifications, in comparison to Ipad 2 xoom is 130g heavier.  It indeed does have bigger monitor, but for me, I'd rather have lighter tablet.  Despite overall weight is around 730g and significantly lighter than my asus 8 inch windows 7 based tablet, it is still noticible weight for me.  Especially holding on one hand or holding up in bed.  If this is the major concern, I recommend one to wait until June when Samsung Android based tablet that supposedly be lighter (by really small margin) than ipad 2 is released.\n\n2. View microsoft office files (primarily word document)\n- So far, I have not found any perfect word viwer application yet.  None of them can render textbox (maybe preminum version of Document2Go). None can recognize SmartArt.  Skydrive shows everything, but not crisp due to lack of SilverLight plugin support for android; besides, Skydrive will not work without internet.\n\n3. Slight learning curve\n- Never owned android product before.  There is definitely much more steeper learning curve with android os than the ipad os.  I didn't mind this or in fact, I enjoyed finding out new things.  But I cannot recommend android os product to my parents as they can hardly surf internet on pc. On the other hand, I am sure they will not have any issue learning ipad2.\n\nSo for those who cannot decide, which one to get like I was.  Just list what your main use will be and compare each.  I am sure either will work out great.  But one thing I can say is that Android Tablet OS is real stuff.  I thought it could be buggy, lots of lags and so on.  But works as smoothly as you can imagine."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "So, I've owned a Motorola Xoom for a whopping twenty-nine hours now. I have to say, I am more impressed operating it than I was reading all the specs on what can only adequately be described as an i-Pad killer.  OK, I will admit that it doesn't have every single thing it needs, but it is still everything that the i-pad aspires to be when it grows up.\nFirst and foremost, its fast. Now I'm not talking \"I'll do one thing at a time really fast\", but taking on five to six HEAVY apps at once, without flinching. To test the fullness of the true multi-tasking of the beautiful dualcore, I proceeded to upload a dozen or so pictures, while downloading and installing four new apps and watching a youtube video. I'd like to see an ipad do that.\nMoving onto the UI. When preparing press releases, the Moto team said that Honeycomb was optimized for the tablet, but holy crap!! They optimized the day lights out of the hardware to properly run the new OS. The screen transitions and menu animations are seamless with no jumping, skipping or hesitating, even under heavy use. Navigation is very intuitive and easy to use. If you want something moved to a new place on the home screens, you just press and drag. They keyboard is large enough even for my hands to comfortably tap out an email or ten, I'm even writing this review using the stock Honeycomb keyboard.\nFinding the setings to add connections is a piece of cake. One of the nice things I like about Android's OS is that by default it notifies of new networks and asks if you want to activate the 3g data connection. On top of that, there are thousands of apps in the newly upgraded Market, some are not optimized for tablets yet, but the ones that have been are fantastic. There is a game that comes preinstalled called \"Cordy\" that totally takes advantage of the processing and graphics power. Full, 100% 3D graphics, with no lag regardless of how fast you play.\nEven better than all of these things is the web browsing experience. Its a full Chrome browser (though not skinned as one), complete with tabbed browsing instant search and all the speed and security we've come to expect from Google. Additionally, that same smooth experience flows to virtually every app I've installed so far.\nSo, on to the negatives:  I read a review that said the Xoom would have SD card support, which is half true with the microSD slot. But full size SD card support would be nice. The matt-black finish does get marked up easily, and the portfolio case from Moto doesn't fit quite as sleekly as I was expecting, but its nice to have the protection on it. That's all I've got for negatives on the Xoom so far. But the pricing from Verizon for 3g should be revised. But that's in no way attributed to the device.\nAll in all, I'd say if you're looking for a tablet, you'd be crazy to take even an ipad 2 over the Moto Xoom."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Being a user of both the original iPad and the Xoom, I find myself disappointed by the Xoom. While I love Android - my family has 3 Android phones - Android is more of an efficiency / productivity tool. Alone, the Xoom appears ok, but I find myself using the iPad instead. Here's why:\n\n- No Netflix on the Xoom\n- iPad has a brighter, higher contrast screen with great viewing angles. So, sharing something with another person is easier.\n- Kindle books are easier to use on the iPad because of its form factor. I read Kindle books in portrait mode and the Xoom is very uncomfortable in portrait\n- Xoom has a very poor selection of tablet apps and virtually no games - all the good games are on iPad\n- I have not had the iPad crash in 4 months. Apps crash about twice a week. I have had about 1/2 dozen force closes per day and several crashes on the Xoom\n\nOverall the Xoom is a disappointment for me. I hope Google can do better, but this is definitely a beta product."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "The Xoom is everything that I had hoped it would be. My son has an iPad and we have some good friendly rivalry. Competition is good for us the consumer. My kids have grown up with the iPod and iPod Touch, so there is a more natural progression to the iPad. However for myself, the flexibility and depth of the Android 3 OS is far superior. I don't like buying into a closed system like iOS.\nOne of the great features that I discovered when I purchased my Xoom was how simple it was to get going. I do own an Androin phone, so that helps. When I logged onto my Xoom I had instamt access to my emails and calendar as I expected. What I did not expect was that all my apps that I had downloaded on my phone were automatically downloaded to my Xoom. What was cool if not a bit scary is that all my wifi log-ins were also synced. I was automatically logged in to anyplace I had saved on my phone.\nFinally as one other reviewer commented, the user interface for Android is was more tablet friendly than the iOS. Apple really need to upgrade the phone app they are currently using."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Let me first state this review is based upon the 3G model (although I just ordered a wifi model from Amazon).  We purchased 2 weeks ago and took the unit on our spring break trip.  During the long drives the xoom ran navigation, played tunes connected to the car stereo and functioned as a skype/FB life line for my teens.  My teens also took a lot of pictures and videos, played games, browsed, read books, etc.  Two things became very apparent:\n\n1) The multi-tasking is top notch, especially with the recent apps button and the ability to quickly move from app to app\n2) The battery life consistently sat at 7-8 hours during heavy use (when it was on it was ALWAYS doing multiple things)\n\nI chose the xoom 3G thinking my wife would hate it and I'd then go buy her an ipad 2 and I'd get to use the xoom.  She has an android 2.x phone and hates it.  She loved honeycomb.  She is now taking the xoom to work as her mobile laptop.  Hence, that's why I just bought the wifi xoom - for me!  I originally decided on the android device based upon being able to create my own \"experience\".  The interface exceeded my expectations.  I have used the ipad in store a number of times and stayed away from gen 1 knowing Apple would release a better pad in about a year.  I saw nothing that made me want to use iOS with gen 2.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Screen clarity, size and brightness is great\n- Multi-tasking is excellent\n- All the apps we used worked flawlessly...only force closed with google books (and why doesn't google books have a bookmark like Kindle for Android?)\n- Very fast\n- Battery life\n- Extremely simple setup with gmail/google, etc...\n- Flash support became available after purchase and web browsing experience is better but not perfect\n- Most importantly, my tablet the way I want it to look and work\n\nThe not so Good:\n\n- Don't like the power plug or the volume buttons.  Its strange, they feel good but it just seems difficult to use them sometimes\n- Screen is (as stated in other reviews) a fingerprint magnet, yet it still looked great\n- App selection is low, but from the time I purchase to the end of the trip the tablet dedicated apps increase by 11 and other than netflix, there is no app I want that is not available\n- Cameras are adequate, but I didn't buy this to replace my digital camera\n- SD card isn't working yet\n\nI did not give this 5 stars as I think it can be improved.  Early in the lifecycle, I expect great things for android based tabs.  The Samsung Galaxy in June (running Honeycomb) should be a great device as well.  Very very pleased with the purchase."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I just got the Xoom yesterday and have been playing with it non-stop ever since. I've been waiting to get a tablet PC for a year and I'm glad I waited. Although the Xoom is a wonderful device, I agree with others that it doesn't feel like a totally \"finished\" product yet, it feels a bit rough, but hopefully that will change in the coming weeks.\nThere is no question that the operating system is different, as others have pointed out, and there is a bit of a learning curve but I feel like the difference has been exaggerated. In my case, in less than 24 hours I'm already totally comfortable using it (this is my first tablet PC by the way). The Xoom is refreshingly fast when surfing the web. One negative point is that a lot of \"important\" apps like Yahoo Mail are not available to download at this point (as of 3/29). Hopefully they will be added soon.\nThe camera is okay but don't expect to take great pictures with it (reminds me of the Evo's camera, which everyone was praising when it first came out, but I have the Evo and I feel like it takes pretty bad pictures).\nI'm a fast typer and I have to say that the keyboard is extremely responsive for the most part (the only exception I've noticed is when you type a word that contains the same letter twice in a row, in which case it will frequently only register it as one letter). You still can't type anywhere near as fast on the Xoom as you can on a regular keyboard but it's a huge improvement over smaller Android devices.\nOne thing that I was surprised was that the Xoom only has a micro USB \"input\" slot so you can plug the Xoom into a PC but you can't plug a camera into the Xoom, for example. (If there is a way to do that then I'm not aware of it).\nThis unit will definitely not replace my laptop because there's a lot you can't do with the Xoom (like any type of serious video editing, etc) but for instant access to the internet it's a wonderful unit.\nOne thing I'm disappointed about is the fact that you can't watch movies from Netflix on this device. Apparently, there are different apps that you can download that allow you to do that but every one of them (that I found so far) costs around 30 bucks. Does anyone know of any free ways to watch netflix movies on the Xoom?\n\n4/6 update: I spoke with Netflix's customer service a few days ago and they told me that a Netlifx App is about to be released \"very soon\" (as in days or weeks according to the guy) and he told me check netflix's blog every few days to be notified of the announcement.\n\nAlso, I still like my Xoom a lot but there are frustrating aspects. For one, even though it was running very quickly and smoothly the first few days, I find myself having to reboot it, sometimes more than once a day, because it gets very slow for no apparent reason and sometimes the browser seems to stop loading pages altogether. I have three different browsers installed on it and all three stop working (yes, wifi is on and the Xoom is showing as being connected to it). Hopefully, it will become more stable in the next few days and weeks with new software updates."}

But then this could simply be that USB doesn't draw enough power to provide an adequate charge.\n\n2. Honeycomb feels rough.\n\nOnce a few more updates come out and there are more apps supporting the tablet it will be great.\n\nI love the feel of the tablet. It's natural to hold it in your hands in landscape.\n\nI don't think this tablet is for everyone though. I don't think any tablet is. I would highly recommend someone playing with one first before buying.\n\nOverall a great product and almost there."}

Screen detail is amazing, this rocket is everything you'd expect out of an iPad, just without all of the Apple boot-licking.  Did I mention fast?  You will NOT be disappointed in the Xoom!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I'm going to try and not gush but after using it for a while now, the xoom will pretty much replace my laptop, excluding the hardcore processing and data entry. It's just an awesome and FLEXIBLE tablet. I've of course ran into some bugs with it and have been like \"why did that happen?\"  But those are minor and simply things I get over. Because the overall user experience is great.  Flash works very well and it makes the Xoom all the better. The apps for will be conducted and the experience will only get better with time. But Google has given a great start already."}

Then in my house all our gadgets (im a gadget freak) I have the 3 known consoles & google tv, desktop with wifi, netbook, notebook, DS, ipod touch, iphone 3gs and so on - they can connect with my router then my latest & love gadget the MOTOROLA XOOM that connect right away.\nWe configure the wifi router to my daughter G1 then reboot her G1 then she connect today with no problem.\nPlease this review of yours is not real reviews its technical issues that ONLY your fault, not MOTOROLA XOOM as almost everybody bought the xoom wifi has 5 stars review not just in AMAZON but anywhere else.\nIm not a fanboy or whatsoever as I have the ipad 2  (i waited the whole day to buy one - im a nurse anesthetist - and I bought the most expensive one as theres no lower price ipad when its my time to buy one, but im ok as I have the money to buy any gadgets i want) and now I have the motorola xoom wifi & I love it... Only apps is im waiting for now...\nThanks to all people who are not just following what apple telling you even its closed OS & you need to jailbreak to be more happy like what I did in my iphone 4 unlike the NEXUS S by google that you can do almost anything out of the box (how much more if you will root it, as my friend told me).\nGOD BLESS YOU ALL"}

The Xoom beats all the other tablets I have used. It is fast (amazingly fast), the screen is beautiful, and the WiFi works perfect. I have yet to have a freeze of any kind or an Ap that does not work. I was thinking of purchasing an iPad2, so glad that was just a thought. Needless to say, this unit has exceeded my expectations. I would not hesitate to purchase again or recommend this to my friends. Great job Motorola and Google!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "I have to admit that I have somewhat impossible standards when it comes to hardware. That being said I really have enjoyed the Xoom tablet. It does have its peccadilloes, such as it is a bit heavy for holding for extended periods. Also a few other minor changes would have been nice, such as the ability to charge over the mini usb port instead of the barrel style proprietary charger that it comes with, and the inclusion of a full size usb port which would allow the user to have usb host abilities. I also wish the front facing camera, and 3.5mm hp jack were more strategically placed at one of the devices corners, allowing them to be used easier in portrait mode. Typing with the built-in keyboard can be a real thumb stretcher, but this is easily solved by the addition of a new keyboard from the market designed for tablet use.\n\nDespite these preferences, the tablet is a pleasure to use, and is especially great at web browsing with the Honeycomb tabbed browser. The Honeycomb OS overall is extremely fast and smooth, although I have at times encountered some a few force closes with apps meant to be used on Android phones and not tablets. But thats to be expected until application developers can optimize their code for the larger screen etc.\n\nBattery life is perfect. I would not have expected a large screen with a dual proc to be this efficient on the battery.\n\nI found gaming especially comes to life on the Xoom, with a full rich sound coming from the lone speaker on the devices rear. Games that I have previously enjoyed on my Nexus One, such as Air Attack HD, are a totally different experience on the Xoom-in the best possible way."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0045FM6SU", "review": "Be aware this device is very old,  it was very advanced for its time, but is,now, no longer supported.  It can be updated to android 4.1.2, but that isn't good enough for today's apps.  If updated to 4.1.2 it will run a few apps of the app store, but not very many.  It does make a good GPS though.  The Xoom does not support the newish xenon chip, which recently started causing lots of problems.\nWe own two of them,  my wife's is nearly abandoned, I keep mine running by fiddling with it all the time.  There isn't a modern internet browser that will run on it.  If you buy one be aware of all the above and more.\nIt is very well mechanically built though, but that doesn't help it on the modern day internet"}

I recently changed the screen protector and just realized what a beating this tablet has taken especially with children in the house. Falling in the beach, market places, around the house and has been quite roughed up. I would still rate this tablet as a classic. yes, its bulky and a bit ugly, but it is robust and their hardware strategy and layout is something other companies should emulate. Was and will be a king. For those complaining about \"lag\", i mean c'mon, this tablet can only do so much with the current apps designed and developed for higher horsepower devices."}
