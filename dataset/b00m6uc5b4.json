{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "HTC delivered a solid tablet in the Nexus 9.  I like the device and feel that it competes well with other tablets on the market.  I especially like Android 5.0 Lollipop and cant wait to get it on my new Droid Turbo phone.  Ive played with the Nexus 9 at length and here are my thoughts so far on the device:\n\n PROS:\n\n- Ships with Android 5.0 Lollipop!!! For me, this is the best thing I like about the tablet\n- Snappy performance\n- GPU should help it perform well for gaming\n- Really good HD display\n- Good sound from the front facing speakers\n- Good battery life\n- Optional Origami like cover that folds into a stand\n- Optional keyboard case (albeit a tad expensive)\n- 4:3 aspect ratio is an improvement over the Nexus 7\n- My big hands can hold it comfortably with one hand for viewing (interacting with it requires two hands of course)\n- The camera is decent for a tablet, especially if you have good lighting\n- I like that you can tap the screen to wake up the tablet\n- I like the soft touch material (although I did detect some flex/non-firmness in the tablets body)\n\n CONS:\n\n- Doesnt really innovate above year old competition\n- No advanced features such as pen support, fingerprint reader, etc.\n- The power and volume buttons are almost flush to the body and hard to locate\n- No SD Card Slot or HDMI port\n- No HDR Camera option\n- The camera auto focus is slow - everything is slow after using the iPhone 6 plus ;-)\n- The cameras optics protrude from the tablets body\n- LTE version not available at launch\n- Would be more compelling if it were $50-$100 cheaper\n\n OTHER POINTS:\n\n- I wish it had a physical home button but thats just my preference\n- The black model is a finger print magnet\n- Android 5.0 needs an Instant HotSpot feature like iOS 8\n- Android should place the home and back buttons on the right/left side of the device when in landscape mode, like the Kindle does\n- Android 5.0 and the new 4:3 aspect ratio may cause some compatibility/user-experience issues until apps are updated.\n- Apps may have to be updated before they will take advantage of the Nexus 9 CPU/GPU\n\n NEXUS 9 VS SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB S 8.4\n\nThe Galaxy Tab S screen is amazing but the tablet can lag.  I haven't observed lag in the Nexus 9 yet.  The Galaxy Tab S can be had for cheaper right now but it doesnt yet >officially< have Android 5.0.  The Nexus 9 ships with Android 5.0 and will get updates quicker.  The Tab S has an SD Card slot if that matters to you.  The Nexus 9 has better sound.  The Nexus 9 is also has a slightly bigger screen which is better for content consumption.  The Tabs S is smaller and more portable.\n\nCha  I would probably lean Galaxy Tab S right now mostly due to price but Id hang onto my receipt in case I found the lag too annoying.  If you play a lot of graphics intensive games, the Nexus 9s GPU gives it the edge over the Tab S, assuming your games have been optimized for its hardware.\n\n NEXUS 9 VS IPAD AIR 2\n\nNeither the iPad Air 2 nor the Nexus 9 offers much to convince you to switch platforms.  If you are undecided on the platform to choose, choose the iPad if you want the best ecosystem, better tablet centric experience, ease of use for non-sophisticated users, and better enterprise support.  Choose the Nexus 9 for a customizable OS, a more techie centric OS, widgets (come on, Apple!!!), or if you make great use of Google Apps.  And as much as I like the Apple Siri App, I much prefer Google Now.\n\nWith the iPad Air 1 costing the same as the Nexus 9 and the iPad Mini 2 being $100 cheaper, its hard for me to recommend the Nexus 9 over them to people that aren't tied to Android or its differentiating features.\n\n NEXUS 9 VS WINDOWS TABLETS\n\nI have several Windows Tablets and convertibles in the house and none of them beat the Nexus 9 in terms of a pure tablet experience.  However, if you want the ability to run desktop apps on a tablet, nothing beats Windows Tablets.  Thus, the decision comes down to how much you plan to use your tablet as a computer.\n\nI do believe that Windows Tablets can someday rival the iPad and Android Tablets in terms of a pure tablet experience.  Unfortunately, Windows Tablets currently see a big gap in terms of usability, available apps, and price/performance ratios.\n\n NEXUS 9 VS KINDLE FIRE HDX 8.9\n\nBasically this comes down to how much you value being able to customize your tablet and run all of the Google Apps versus having an easier to use, content centric tablet that includes possibly free content.\n\nI have an Amazon Prime membership. As a result, five seconds after setting up my Kindle, I was watching The Avengers movie for free!  For me, free movies, TV, music, and books beats a customizable OS every day of the week!\n\nYes, my Kindle HDX 8.9 doesnt support Google Services Apps and getting other Google Play apps on my Kindle requires a one time, 4 minute easy hack.  I just rather use Google Services Apps on my phone and use the free content on my Kindle.\n\n BOTTOM LINE\n\nI like the Nexus 9.  It doesnt try to wow you with crazy specs for gimmicky software.  It delivers a solid Android tablet experience at a competitive price.  I think its the perfect size for a tablet.  Its big enough to allow you to enjoy consuming content with it.  Its not so big that it makes your hand tired from holding it.\n\nI really like Android 5.0 Lollipop.  I feel like Google does more to innovate its >mobile< operating system than Apple or Microsoft.  As a tech geek, I appreciate many of the enhancements Android 5.0 brings.  I just wish Android was a little more tablet centric.  For example, in landscape mode, move the home and back buttons to the edge of the screen where my thumbs are, not the middle of the screen.  This is how my Kindle Fire HDX works.\n\nSpeaking of my 4th generation Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, I much prefer it and recommend it over the Nexus 9.  Since I have an Amazon Prime membership, I get access to movies, TV, music, and books at no additional cost.  By adding the 1mobile app to my Kindle, I can easily install almost all of the apps that are available for Android, not just those available from the Amazon app store.  I simply much prefer the Kindles content centricity and ease of use over any other tablet, including the Nexus 9.\n\nWith the Samsung Galaxy Tab S being so much cheaper these days, I cant say that the Nexus 9 is a better option.  I wish the Nexus 9 had some advanced, innovative hardware or features to differentiate it.  Ditto for comparing the Nexus 9 to the iPad Air 1 or iPad Mini 2.  Spec wise the Nexus 9 may look more appealing but in actual use, I think people would be happy with any of these tablets.  Because of this, the cheaper options have the edge, in my opinion."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Possibly the worst tablet ever made with the worst customer support. Purchased from T-Mobile with T-Mobile Service contract. Had the tablet 1 full year before it got stuck in a boot loop. It did a normal google update and got stuck in a boot loop. Unfortunately for me, I terminated my contract with T-Mobile just before this happened. T-Mobile then would only be responsible for the tablet up to the contract termination day. So, upon their suggestion, I contacted Google. Google then referred me to T-Mobile so I told them T-Mobile referred me to them. Google & T-Mobile then referred me to HTC. HTC deny any responsibility. Their customer service seem to want to avoid dealing with any Nexus 9s. Even their website is avoidant of showing any warranty or repair contact for Google Nexus 9. HTC referred me back to Google who they claim caused the issue. Now, not only is my tablet in a boot loom, but I was stuck in a customer service boot loop as well! In the end I decided to take the tablet to an independent repair shop. I was told that it was completely bricked. It can't even take a side-load OTA. I was told to send it back to HTC... In the end I wrote it off as a very expensive loss and I will never buy another HTC/Google/T-Mobile product again. So disappointed in this. For the money I paid for this brick I could have had an Apple iPad mini! Just to show a comparison of longevity - my original ipad is still running and being used - never once had a repair issue with it."}

The tablet quit loading up in March of 2017 and originally, HTC, the manufacturer, was contacted to troubleshoot the potential technical issues.  Through their troubleshooting it was determined the tablet was defective and needed to be replaced.  It was confirmed the tablet had a one year warranty and was still under the warranty.  However, the warranty is through the seller Mobile Front,not HTC.  Mobile Front was contacted multiple times via Amazon.com on March 31, April 6, and April 10th by the purchasers son Mike Post referencing the order number and product in question. Mobile Front was also contacted by Ann Post during this time period about the tablet and warranty. Neither person received a response directly from Mobile Front and this issue remains unresolved and the tablet still will not load up/work, it was described by HTC as \"stuck in a loop.\".  The emails are documented proof that the seller was contacted multiple times about the tablet and the warranty within the one year period and the seller failed to take any action.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "So here is the deal. If you happen to get a good one great but you have a pretty good chance of getting a bad one as well. Depending on the model and the time frame or location that it was  manufactured there will be slightly different screens but one common thing I have found is a battery issue. More specifically the connection from the battery to the baseboard can become slightly oxidized. Not sure if this is an issue with the metals being dissimilar (galvanic corrosion) or the connector just not being firm enough.  It seems to create the issue of the voltage being delivered becoming too low through resistance building up even though the battery is just fine. The probability of the issue presenting itself on any particular device goes up as the battery reaches 50% charge level. It will present itself as a frozen tablet or more likely as people have posted pictures of show a garbled screen and put out a static noise if the volume is up at all.  The issue really started to become more common after the battery and power management changes in 7.x update of Android but would have been present anyway. Also. The harder the tablet is being driven by app the more likely it is too have a problem. It really started showing up after one of the most common apps, Netflix, changed the CODECs being used.  They used a CODEC that the Tegra CPU doesn't have in hardware optimized and that created higher CPU usage and more heat. Other video services use older less demanding CODECs. That update coincided with some Android updates magnifying the problem. Ugh!\n\nIf you able and adventurous you can try and work around the problem yourself simply by taking the back cover off disconnecting battery and cleaning both terminal and connector. You might need a magnifying glass to do this as they are small and to verify that you don't leave any sort of lint behind. I did this once I narrowed the issue down abd haven't had a problem since. It also seemed to help the longevity and charging of the  battery which would make some sense but I didn't have numbers to verify or compare definitively.\n\nAll that being said, the tablet get a star knocked off because it just doesn't have enough active RAM. (not storage) 2GB just wasn't enough. 3GB would have done it but 4GB would have been best. Without it the apps tend to swap in and out. Kind of annoying if you have a bunch of browser tabs. This is especially true if you have any apps installed that keep services running in background such as music players. All in all I will continue to use it.\n\nFor reference.  I also have a Nexus 7 and like that too.  It is a tough little guy and my kid usually has it.  My iPad is good but it sits on the shelf usually unless I need it for a specific app."}

I have had it for only a month, and with the amount of money spent on it, you'd think I'd've bought a decent machine. Oh no. The same week I bought it, it started freezing up. It can't handle more than one app open at once, and God forbid you'd like to listen to music while browsing the web. No, no. One or the other. In fact, having nothing open but chrome, I had to force stop and reset the damn thing while writing this review. But don't worry, that only happens three or four times a day. I bought this garbage new and I really regret it. If you're like me and thought this would be an upgrade to your Nexus 7, please know that you would be far better off just buying another 7. It at least friggin works."}

Two years of use later and it's solidly my least favorite bit of mobile hardware to date. Awkward ergonomics of the 8.9\" screen aside, this device has degraded in performance faster than either of the nexus 7 devices and has become crippled under the influence of Android - Marshmallow. Despite a factory reset, app performance is intermittently jerky, the device occasionally crashes and restarts, and sometimes it refuses to show the unlock screen, requiring a hard reboot.\n\nFurthermore, Marshmallow introduced an audio bug that produces a crackling static behind all audio produced on the device speakers OR through headphones connected to the audio jack. The only way to work around this is by using a bluetooth device. This issue has been reported multiple times since January of 2016 and no resolution has been pushed. This device is practically useless to me at this point."}

They would not send a replacement and recommended that I contact Amazon. I did, and since I bought it from 3rd Party (Mobile Front) Amazon said to contact them. I sent them a message but never received a reply in 3 weeks. I contacted Amazon again and they were at least gracious enough to give me a partial refund, no thanks to Mobile Front. I will NOT be buying another product from Mobile Front or HTC."}

Each process takes a full 40 minutes:\nEnter password....download...agree...install...restart...enter password...download...enter password...install...\nI should have sent it back right then and there. The device also comes loaded with Google-centric apps, because every tech company assumes that you just cannot wait until they control every aspect of your life. Yes you can \"uninstall\" apps...theoretically. But they all stay in your update list and in your menu so that you have to individually select what you want to update. Mistakenly hit \"Update All\" and you're right back in the same mess again. And the updates. I guess I should be grateful but...every two or three days there's another list to select. I can't believe that the smartest company on the planet hasn't figured out a better system. I don't know about you, but I read, I check Facebook, and I like to listen to music. The maintenance of this thing gets into the middle of everything I want to do.

The Nexus 9 is also a very fast device with a NVIDIA Tegra K1 64-bit dual-core processor at 2.3 GHz. In my opinion the Nexus 9 is a great device; it is very fast, and in my personal experiences, the battery charge lasted 2-3 days with normal use. Additionally, with its big screen it is a great device to play games on or watch movies and videos. I have personally used this product for about a year now and I love it.  However, the one drawback is its price, the Nexus 9 usually starts around $325+. But if you are willing to spend the money, it is a great overall device that you are sure to love."}

Only issue I've ever had is sometimes the screen on my first device would get lines and the device will lock up while on the internet, could just be me and it doesn't happen often. Then again it could be because I left it on top on my car one and drove off, slid off onto the street screen first and ran over the edge, got screen scratches that mostly buffed out and only minor cosmetic damage to the side metal. They can run a bit warm sometimes but I use a smartcase to keep the heat off my fingers.\n\nOnly con I can think of is when on the brightest screen setting it doesn't charge as fast as it uses power so it'll use more than the plug is able to provide, I read somewhere on the internet about the internal charging circuit only accepting some maximum (1amp?) charge regardless of the power supply. Still, while plugged in on the brightest setting and playing streaming TV it'll easily run for most the day on 100% bright and maybe forever if you turned down brightness."}

Believe it or not, she insisted that thelight breeding is a software issue. Probably she was educated in that way. Anyhow, I finally persuaded her that it is not software issue after a few minutes of conversation and I asked a service. Then, she asked to me to ship it to their service center for myself. I emphasized that this is a new one, but she repeated it and it is their policy. I didn't send it because I didn't want to pay the shipping.

It still looks new; However, I am highly disappointment about this product since it is practically useless due to some kind of graphic or hardware issues. It all started with a very high-pitch noise and a fuzzy display probably around six months after purchase. I got really worried especially because nothing would work on the tablet and I had to push the restart button so long to basically force the restart. I got frustrated and really didn't know what to do. I thought I keep a close eye on it for a few days and see what happens, and nothing had happened for quite a few months. I thought maybe it was a one-time thing and it never happens again. After about five to six months, it happened again and again and again. The problem became so frequent, probably around once a week, till about a month ago when it happens five times when I am using a tablet for only about an hour. I thought maybe a factory reset would help, but it didn't do anything helpful. Now it doesnt produce any noise, it is just a fuzzy screen. Sometimes the screen just freezes and I cannot do anything with the tablet and it goes fuzzy after a few minutes. It is really to the point that I cannot use it at all and the money I paid for it is flushed down the toilet. Really?! It didn't even work for 2 years for such light use. I am really disappointed."}

The specs look nice, but then you begin noticing small problems.  You type these into google and realize that these are common problems.  Disconnects, freezing screens, charging problems, random errors that crash the entire device and makes a loud beeping noise and white screen.  The device essentially holds together long enough until the warranty expires, and then becomes a brick.  Type in top ten tablets, this was easily number 2, two years ago, but nowadays, people just laugh if you mention it.  It wasn't a total crap shoot, so it gets more than one star.  More like a working car, that you start noticing the bumper falling off after a year's worth of driving, and then the battery overheating more easily.  The specs do look nice on paper and when it works."}

Even used, they could not have been that old.\n\nI wouldn't give such a low rating, but HTC wouldn't make these right. They were out of warranty and we were aware of that. But I spent at a minimum 4 hours--more like 6--on trying to troubleshoot, then address the repairs of these tablets. We also paid for the shipping both times to the repair center. The first repair was quoted at $240 and since that is so high compared to the new price, we negotiated and paid $120. HTC would not reduce our price on the second, so I will not repair.\n\nCustomer Service at HTC is very nice and they will spend a lot of time with you, but it doesn't help much when their products totally fail."}

For my general browsing needs at home, and occasionally taking an internet source on the go, it had been great.  Until a couple weeks ago.\nI had gotten an OTA software upgrade notification and put it off a few weeks.  After work, things were running a little sluggish, so with a full battery I figured I'd go ahead and update since I was going to restart anyhow.  An hour later, I come back inside and the update is complete... And now a notification would pop up saying \"Unfortunately, process Android.phone etc has stopped\", which wouldn't be a problem, except it would pop up again every time I hit \"Ok\", making the tablet unusable.  I decided to factory reset, and low and behold, I'm in a bootloop.  Going for system recovery tells me my device is corrupt.\nI take it to a local phone repair shop, and two weeks later they say they're out of options.  If I'd bought a Samsung there'd be no problem fixing it, they say.  Upon calling HTC for help, I was told since I was out of warranty, I'm welcome to send it to them to fix it (and probably get someone else's refurbished unit back).  I said I don't understand why I have to pay for a repair when an OTA update ruined what was working fine for me.  The rep said that's understandable and he'd put me in contact with his manager.  After waiting on hold for 15 minutes, they hang up on me and the automated ladies voice for an exit survey comes on.\nSo here I am with a $400 paper weight.  I really don't want to give HTC anymore of my money, but I'm not sure what option I have at this point.\nI'm assuming I'll have to have them repair/replace it, take the hit and sell it on craigslist and just buy a Surface 3.\nBasically, I liked it (emphasis on the past tense) but the update screwed me.  If you buy a Nexus 9, I'd be very wary of any updates they send your way, and do some research online before you let the machine update."}

Didn't do any benchmarks but my impression is that this is a big speedy tablet. The video is exceptional. Most video comments though are con's.\nCon's: HTC support is poor. After 7 weeks of owning this 1lb tablet have one app restored to the HTC and am happy that the game uses the full screen and works o.k.\nNFC which allows to touch one NFC(near field communication) device to another would allow a data transfer, but HTC had problems with NFC defects on some Nexus 9 tablets like mine.\nNFC would ideally do a transfer by holding my Nexus 7 back against the Nexus 9 back then presto, but no such luck. Only app data transfer that worked was through Gmail account.\nThe big drawback here is the same complaint for i pad users in that HTC and google chose to go with the 4:3 video aspect ratio which provides a 3 inch picture in the middle of your 9 inch tablet. Turns your 9 inch tablet into a 3 inch screen. With Netflix ones you start any video it displays the 3 inch strip and the rest of the screen is black. This tablet is 6 inches wide, which most people can't hold in one hand.\n\nConclusion This HTC Google Nexus 9 is a $300 1lb paperweight. Went back to my Nexus 7 and main regret is I didn't return this poor quality tablet.\nReally like Nexus products but would never recommend the HTC Nexus 9 to a friend."}

Not the OS that's on the iPad.  To me,  Android is just a better platform and that's why I purchased this.  The  weak link for this tablet is the hardware.  This thing freezes occasionally,  suffers some sound issues and sometimes just quits.  I wish (it's just froze on me now)  Google would be more selective with who they allowed to manufacture these things.  Or maybe Google needs to up the spec requirements.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I'm a big fan of Android and the Nexus line of devices, but my year and a half with this tablet has just been frustrating. It was barely usable with Lollipop because it was just extremely buggy and Google was extremely slow about updates. It ran hot, crashed a lot and the battery life was pretty pathetic in general even after a Factory reset. Marshmallow brought a lot of relief, with huge improvements to battery life and stability, but it's still not 100%.\n\nThis tablet is not something I would ever classify as a flagship device worthy of being classified as a competitor to the iPad.  I've had two HTC devices with Nvidia processors (this tablet and the HTC One X+). I'm not impressed with either as the high performance promised by Nvidia on paper just doesn't shine through. These chipsets are buggy battery hogs as far as I can tell. I also have the Nexus 6 by Motorola based on a Qualcomm chipset and it is a dream, especially compared to this tablet. (As a side note, the Nexus 6 is the best phone I've ever owned by a wiiiide margin.)\n\nI really like Marshmallow, but I still think Google is optimizing it for smartphones. Tablet support in general is just an afterthought. Even though this device now gets regular updates since Google started doing monthly security updates, they seem to cause problems with the Nexus 9. After the last update, it crashed so frequently that I was on the verge of a Factory reset. Manually wiping out the cache partition through recovery addresses some of the instability. I don't see the same issue on my Nexus 6, so I am again left with the impression that this device is just an afterthought for Google.\n\nIf you are considering this tablet, don't bother unless you catch it on a fantastic sale. It's not worth the price."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I have read lots of the other reviews, especially the negative ones. I'm a bit puzzled by many of them. I think some people have unreasonable expectations in tech devices. I'm also surprised at the many reviews about devices being defective right out if the box. It is not really consistent with HTC's history or reputation. They were one of the first companies that made cool quality phones at reasonable prices,not cheap, reasonable. This tablet like those phones is not cheap but compared to tablets of the same generation with similar hardware and specs it is reasonable. Now without doing the compare $450 apples to $300 Nexus oranges. Take a look at what you get if it is free of factory defects and wasn't banged around in shipping (which I thick is behind most out of the box issues). A large 3 by 4 screen with 2k resolution and it is bright.... beautiful really. The sound is as good or better than any tablet on the market. Watch a movie on this makes you forget your watching on a tablet. The size, sound and wide view angle make watching with friends easy. Touch response is instantaneous, scrolling is scary smooth and swiping through desktops just as smooth and impressively free of blurring or stuttering.  Quibbling over number of CPU cores, amount of ram, and clock speeds is a waste of time. What matters is how well the whole package works together. This tablet will hold its own with anything from Apple, Microsoft or any other brand even at prices 2, 3 even 4 times this Nexus 9's. It is also a good point that the $1000 + tablet of today will be out moded old tech in 3 years. Get your N 9 save some money and enjoy how nice todays tech really is. Should you get the rare defective device or the one the delivery guys kicked around the truck, there is a return process. if you are the type who throws fits over waiting for that to workout (2 weeks) you should maybe think about seeing a shrink. Stuff happens and grown ups deal with it. Nice tablet!"}

Only the manufacturer can wipe and reinstall the BIOS. So now I have an expensive and useless device. What a horrible waste! Google should be ashamed.

I've owned Nexus 7 tablets and would gladly use the Nexus 7 2nd gen over this at the moment. When I first got this I was excited despite having very little faith in HTC products (Based on previous HTC smartphone experiences). This tablet started out nice and fast but had a weird audio bug on the notification sound. Something that sounded like a dying robot from the 60s. Then in 2016 it received an update that cause several issues.\n\n1st Issue: To date the tablet refuses to rotate periodically. Sometimes I can close the lid and reopen to resolve but most times it's a reboot.\n2nd Issue: I unlock the screen and it goes black, unlock, black, unlock, black to infinity. I can play with the magnetic lid and rotate and eventually it might work. Or I reboot. (Does not appear to matter what lock style I use)\n3rd issue: This issue appears to be in relation to the above issues. Double tap to wake or mag cover waking is broken.\n\nSuspected Cause: The magnet used in conjunction with the case for wake/sleep state. I believe this as several magnet cases all cause the same results but case removal or non-magnetic cases have caused no issue. Also am sticking to this being a result of a software update as I had the tablet for 1 year with no issues with my magnetic clasp case. There have been no real notices from google on product forums about acknowledging the issue much less and steps to resolve."}

When my 7 met an untimely demise (a disagreement between it and a glass top table), I decided to upgrade to the Nexus 9. First because I have always had great performance from my older HTC phones. I loved my HTC's, and the Nexus 9 has front facing speakers, as every tablet should have.\n\nI am quickly falling out of love with HTC. My most recent \"smart\" phone, HTC One M8, has been a major disappointment. Now I have a Nexus 9 and so far, another major disappointment. It is very slow to charge and way to quick to drain the battery. It is constantly overheating. The upper right back gets almost too hot to touch. I am guess that is where the processor is located.\n\nThe size is a bit awkward, just a little too wide to hold comfortably. Many of the apps are stretched to fit the width and are distorted, that messes with my eyes and my mind. The shell has nice, clean, sharp edges, adding to the discomfort when held. The power and volume buttons are set to low, almost recessed, again the shell making them difficult to locate and push.\n\nI give it 3 stars, because I can not give it 2.5. It is barely OK.\n\nI had to change my rating to 2 stars. The more i use the tablet, the less i like it. The speakers are not the same quality as even my M8. The more apps i use, the more the distortion on the the screen as they stretch to fill the Nexus 9 awkward proportions, the more i grow bored with  the ill looking graphics. The constant difficulty in locating and pushing the power and volume buttons is getting very annoying. Where were google's quality folks when this was being designed?"}

I played a couple games on it like Candy Crush.\nProblem is after a month it started lagging a lot and getting hot when playing games. Add another 22 days (for a total of 55 days) and it get's hot from simply being on within about five minutes of reading. I purchased an app to show CPU usage, and see that the CPU is at 100% almost all the time.\nIt stopped charging with the included AC adapter, and it also started crashing to the point of random reboots. The display star6ted developing light bleed as well. I put it in a case with a screen protector. I actually have a phone from 2010 that still works, so I know how to take care of devices.\nAfter getting a hold of Google, I was told that because I didn't purchase it through them I had to go through HTC or Amazon for support. I went though HTC, to start an RMA but they put the wrong serial number. I called back to correct it, and I never heard from them again.\nFortunately Amazon is willing to take it back, but at a loss.\nI started liking this tablet, but in the end with the developing problems and horrible support from HTC, I can't recommend this at all. This really was something that was huge disappointment and loss."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "There is a reason 1-star reviews dominate this \"Nexus\" device.  The device is garbage.  It's made from the lowest quality components, and relies on the Android software to perform a miracle, which simply doesn't happen.\n\nWhy does the machine belong in the trash?\n\n> HTC uses a poor quality LCD screen, with the cheapest assembly process so that the edges \"bleed\" light, yielding a non-uniform display.\n> 2 GB of RAM is severely limiting.  Even complex web pages crash the browser, likely a result of the machine running out of RAM.\n> Storage space is SLOW.  System updates, application opens, everything takes forever because the read/write is so unbearably slow.  It took nearly all day to install the 10+ security updates and OS upgrades, each one taking 20-30 minutes.\n> SIM tray won't eject.  For the LTE version, I had an issue removing the SIM tray with the included ejection tool.  It took several minutes of probing around before it finally ejected.  Just another testament to the inferior design and assembly quality.\n> I started \"factory resetting\" my device 20 minutes ago to return it to the seller, and it has frozen 4 different times. It will not factory reset. I kid you not. The device stops responding when asked to perform a basic Android function. (It finally reset...I think. But took forever with no indication it was doing anything.)\n\nPROS:\n\nThe only good thing about the device is the fact that the color accuracy is a bit better compared to Samsung AMOLED displays. On AMOLED displays, shadows are \"burned,\" or made more contrasty and darker.  This is a problem with hair or b/w photographs, for example, as the overly dark shadows make it difficult to see any detail.  At the very least, the LCD panel on the Nexus 9 is more faithful to detail in shadows.  That is literally the only thing I can think of that I like.\n\nI'm returning this to the retailer.  Hopefully they will do the right thing and put it in the recycling bin where it belongs."}

I am not paying that much money to fix it and I will have to buy an iPad because this is unacceptable.\n\nOriginal Review: I do like this tablet a lot. The sound is great for Spotify and that was a big factor in me buying it. My only thing is it crashes sometimes. Usually when my niece and nephew have about six game apps opening, but a couple times it crashes for no reason. It is not daily or anything but it is odd to have a product like this crash at all. I love Android though and it is seamless in how it connects with my phone. I am still glad I bought this tablet but it is definitely not perfect.\n\nSo eight months later, this tablet is horrible at multitasking. It cannot do Spotify and other apps at the same time well at all. It will make a weird, loud noise frequently when it is struggling to do more than one thing at a time. It is slooooow. Yesterday, I went to install the update and now it won't boot up at all. It wouldn't let me recover it either. I called customer support but I don't have my tablet with me, so I have to call back when I do. I got a great deal on this tablet but it is basically a POS. I may have to end up buying an iPAD. :("}

I use it for reading, web browsing, watching videos, audio streaming, social media, standard Google productivity apps, and some gaming.  I also use it at work for note taking using FiiNote with a stylus.  As a productivity tool, the Nexus 9 is awesome.  I've owned an ASUS Transformer first generation device which had a lot of software issues with apps.  I also own a Kindle Fire HD which is great for multimedia and reading but is a bit awkward as a productivity tool.\n\nHowever, the Nexus 9 leaves much to be desired in the hardware department.  My unit had light bleed after a few months of use.  I think that was from playing a pinball game which I would press harder than normal on the screen.  I've played the same game on both the Transformer and the Kindle Fire without any problems.\n\nAlso, after a year of use, my unit started to overheat and crash.  In the last 2 months, the crashes are becoming more frequent.  Some apps would cause the unit to heat up in the corner where the camera is and crash.  Because of this, the device is pretty much useless as a productivity tool."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "It's unfortunate that so many people have had an issue with this device, but I also know that people are far more motivated to leave a review when they are unhappy, versus those who are completely happy with the device...of which, I fall into the latter camp.\n\nI received my (white) Nexus 9 as a Christmas gift, and was \"upgrading\" from a Nexus 10. I use parenthesis when I say \"upgrading,\" because I know the resolution on the N10 is higher, and it's a lighter device, but they both share 2 GB's of RAM...but the new Nvidia processor chip makes a HUGE performance difference.\n\nPrior to adding it to my holiday wish list and receiving it, I voraciously read (and watched review videos) about all of the issues regarding light bleed, mushy back panels, battery life, overheating and performance issues. I also read plenty of reviews in which it appears many of those issues were addressed by devices manufactured more recently, along with seeing performance issues disappear after the 6.0.1 update.\n\nThe device I received has been absolutely stellar. Although I do get a very small amount of light bleed in the lower left of the screen, it is barely noticeable and not distracting to me (only noticeable on very black backgrounds), or as egregious as some of the photos and issues that others have experienced and shared.\n\nThe back is not mushy at all, and is completely firm, has zero give, and feels really well constructed and solid...which I was extremely happy about, as having a mushy back panel can make a device feel cheap and is a pet peeve of mine when spending a lot of money on a device, to the point of my being borderline OCD about it, and it was the first thing I checked for.\n\nI received the White version, which I do think adds a more premium look and feel to it, with virtually no noticeable fingerprints. Battery life has been great, easily lasting an entire day with pretty heavy usage and on-screen time, usually leaving me with around 65% at the end of the day. Charging has not been slow for me, but I use a different charger than the one it comes with, instead using the turbo charger that comes with my Droid Turbo. I don't think it charges the N9 any faster, since I don't think it supports rapid charging, but I can get back up to 100% pretty quickly.\n\nOccasionally I feel some heat emanating from below the panel near the camera, but certainly nothing that is distracting, uncomfortable or unusual from other devices I've used in which I am doing something that requires a little more processing power (i.e. games etc).\n\nFrom a performance standpoint, the N9 has been an outstanding improvement over my N10. I have not been able to throw anything at it so far (in terms of games: Star Wars: Heroes, Hearthstone, Fallout Shelter, Monument Valley, The Room etc) in which I've noticed any discernible lag or performance issues. Scrolling through web and app content is exceptionally smooth, and launching apps is quick. Compared to my N10, the N9 really hums and performs very quickly.\n\nSound is also a big improvement. Although my N10 also had front facing speakers, the N9 has HTC's BoomSound speakers, which I also had on my previous HTC One and loved.\n\nMy only \"complaints\" would be that it is a good deal heavier than my N10, but at the same time (for me) makes it feel more premium and well-built. So holding it over long period of time can start to dig into your hands / palms, unless you are holding it in a way in which you're leaning forward a little and it just rests in your hand. But laying back or holding it up to your face, you can start to feel the weight when needing to balance it this way. Also, the bezel is a lot smaller than my N10 (a pro and a con), because you have less surface area to place your fingers, but it also means that you get more screen.\n\nSpeaking of the screen, it has been beautiful and crystal clear. Although the resolution is lower than my N10, I can barely tell a difference and have compared both screens while reading identical comic books from Comixology, watching YouTube videos etc. I don't see any pixelation, text is crisp, and everything looks fantastic on it. I thought that I might miss the widescreen ratio of the N10, I really haven't. The only time it's been an issue is if I cast the screen to my television, and instead of filling my widescreen TV as my N10 does, it displays in more of a square ratio, like on the device.\n\nHopefully I've addressed all of the issues that you might be concerned with, if you're deciding whether or not to get the Nexus 9. Although it's now considered an \"older\" device, I love the Nexus brand over other alternatives (like Samsung etc) because I don't like a skinned or bloated OS, and prefer a pure Android experience, along with all of the quick and timely updates that come with it.\n\nI likely would not have purchased it at its original price of $499, but now that it's in the $300's, it is perfectly within what I am willing to bear for what is considered an \"older\" device. And as I said, although people are (understandably) far more motivated to write (negative) reviews when something goes wrong, there are many, many people who are perfectly happy with their Nexus 9, have not experienced the issues that others have reported, and simply never took the time to share their opinion or review.\n\nWhich is the reason for mine."}

Initially when I purchased this device the only problems I could see with it were the common light bleeding issues. That didn't bother me much. Yet I still returned it to bestbuy.\nLater on I purchased the device again from another online retailer and within the first few days of having the device experienced a shutting off of the screen and loud screeching noise coming from it. This happen often within the first few days. I reset the device to factory defaults and was then locked out of my tablet despite trying to login with my credentials. After more hassle and nightmare scenarios I returned that product back as well. Just do yourself a favor and buy another tablet. I really wouldn't wish anyone to go through the pain of owning this one."}

At first it would randomly shutoff but that stopped happening a a few updates.  At first auto rotate wouldn't work unless you disabled location and \"google now\".  That one took several months to be fixed.  Now it frequently freezes with a white checkboard pattern mixed with the image on the screen and plays a horrible noise through the speakers.  Since I first report this issue 1 month after my warranty expired they want to charge me $120 for a repair.\n\nThe 4x3 aspect ratio is better for working and sometimes web browsing but most apps and mobile sites as designed for 16x9 it hurts more than it helps.  Also watching movies bad.  What is worse is when using it with a chromecast with something that isn't natively support for chromecast, the 4x3 image on a 16x9 large TV looks really bad.\n\nThe speakers sounds great for a mobile device though."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I've been using Android tablets since the beginning. I've had a Motorola Xoom, an Asus Transformer Prime, a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 and now the Nexus 9. And I can comfortably say that the Nexus 9 is by far the best tablet I've ever had. Luckily, I received a unit which had only minimal backlight bleeding, which doesn't bother me even when watching movies.\nThe screen is superb. The colors aren't overly saturated and the color accuracy is spot on. Overall a very well calibrated display. While it doesn't have the 360ppi pixel density of my old TabPro 8.4, I can't really say that the difference is easily noticeable. It's definitely sharp enough at 289ppi (hey, the iPad can get away with having 265ppi).\nThe front facing speakers are amazing, especially if you're coming from a tablet with speakers on the side or back (pretty much all the others).\nThe build feels very solid, if not as high quality as the iPad. The metal on the sides and the soft, rubbery plastic on the back makes the tablet comfortable to hold, and makes for a simplistic design, but it doesn't feel cheap at all. The tablet feels dense, because of its large battery, but the long battery life sure makes up for the extra weight. By the way, I've been getting about one and a half days of medium to heavy usage (gaming, web browsing, watching videos on YouTube and Netflix, and some social networking).\nAs for performance, it's by far the fastest tablet I've ever head. Basic navigation is basically flawless, but it's still Android, so you will encounter a few hiccups when browsing the web or heavily multi-tasking, though these are rare enough not to be annoying. As for gaming, this thing is a beast. It can play any current game with excellent fluidity. Although be aware that it can get quite warm while playing the heaviest games (Sniper Fury made it get very warm after a while), and if you're on a warm country (it's summer here in So Paulo) you may experience some thermal throttling on the GPU occasionally (Sniper Fury was the only game I tested that could produce that result). In any case, this tablet is a beast for gaming, and the screen size and the front-facing speakers enhance the gaming experience even further.\nOverall a great tablet, and possibly the best Android tablet out there. I'm really enjoying using it, and I hope other Android tablet manufacturers follow Google's and HTC's steps (considering the Galaxy Tab S2, they are). It's such a pleasure to use I've written this review entirely on it.\nDefinitely recommend it, but watch out because there are still some \"bad\" units being sold, which was not my case."}

I have a Nexus phone and thought it would be great to have consistency between all of my apps and utilities. Well.....\nThis tablet is sssllloooowwwww. Consistently slow. Nexus 6 phone is much faster and I use it more than I use this tablet. The keyboard on the tablet doesn't have the ability to use the alternate keyboard with numbers at the top (like the phone does).  The tablet and phone do not consistently sync on two important apps, Overdrive and Audible. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't; intermittent problems are THE worst!  My IMAP email account has stopped syncing on the tablet altogether. And the Chrome browser is absolutely mind numbingly slow...the native browser! Unbelievable. The tablet has updated to the latest Android OS about 3 months ago. I thought things might improve but, no. I waited a long time to write this review and think I've given it a fair shot. I wanted to love it but mostly it frustrates me and I end up using my phone and its much smaller screen. I do not recommend this tablet."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Many a review has been written about this controversial tablet. Some people love it, some hate it, some are disappointed by it and what it represents. So here's my 2 cents, I'll try not to repeat what others have said:\n\nHardware defects: Let's get this out of the way. I got a unit with serial number HT597, meaning it was made in September 2015.\n* There is no screen bleed.\n* Power and volume buttons are quite inset, even though I believe this is the fixed version. They are still pressable, though, but they're not as solid or raised as the ones on my Nexus 5. Compared with a friend who had a black Nexus 9 (mine is white), and his buttons seemed to be better (i.e. more raised). Interpret this as you want.\n* Back panel has a bit of give and creaks a bit in the upper right hand corner (i.e. to the right of the camera, above the nexus lettering). Not noticeable in daily use and certainly not a problem for me, I wouldn't have even noticed it if I hadn't known about this hardware defect on some units. This is certainly different from and not as bad as the reports of creaking in the middle of the back panel (which in my case doesn't occur).\n\nOverall hardware:\n* Screen is gorgeous! Easily one of the highlights of the tablet. Great for media and work and everything.\n* Otherwise solid build. Got white version as reviewers recommended because it catches less fingerprints. While that is true, on the other hand...\n* The white version's side bezel is metallic silver, which results in: 1) a more premium feel, but 2) the bezel is very easy to scratch or dent, and scratches are very noticeable to me (I'm the kind of person that can be driven nuts by details like this). So your options are: 1) be very very careful with it, 2) put a case on it (I hate cases), 3) put a skin on it, like the one from dbrand.com (that's what I'll be doing).\n* Tablet is a bit on the heavy side, so one-handed use depends on your muscles. I'm a standard male, and for me, I can use it one-handed but not for extended periods (that may change as I build muscle in my wrist).\n\nPerformance: I immediately updated to Android 6.0.1, so I'll be reviewing that.\n* If you do lots of multitasking, switching apps frequently, etc, expect hiccups, hangs, and the occasional restart. They really should have put 3GB of ram in this tablet, it has a lot of pixels to push around.\n* On the other hand, if you do one thing at a time, it's fantastic. I use it mostly for reading (Pocket articles, Play Books, Amazon Kindle), and watching YouTube videos, and it works great for that.\n* Chrome is almost completely unusable, as tabs refresh constantly. I use the Link Bubble browser, which works better for me.\n* Battery life has been so-so. It recharges slowly, taking around 5 hours from 5% to 100%. I average around 5 hours of screen-on time. Moderate- to heavy-use gets me through half a day, with light use you can get through a whole day.\n\nFinal opinion: If you can get it for sub-$300 (for the 32GB version), go for it. Otherwise look into the Nvidia Shield tablet (if you're looking for a lower price), or into the iPad Mini or iPad Air (if you have more to spend and are looking for best-of-the-best performance). Otherwise, this is the best all-in-one Android tablet currently, in my opinion."}

I also like the folio keyboard, although it is rather cramped and takes some time to get used to typing on it.\n\nThe main drawback of this tablet is the poor performance. It literally takes 3-4 minutes to boot up, and periodically freezes.  This problem has persisted across several versions of the Android OS now, so I suspect that it is related to the hardware.\n\nAnother problem is that the screen is highly prone to scratches - particularly from the folio keyboard itself.  This was highly disappointing.  If I were buying this new, I would definitely get a screen protector.  Then again, I wouldn't actually buy this product knowing what I do now.

Also the battery always show full and between 3,600 to 4,200% charged. Needles to say a real inconvenience since you can easily use up the battery without knowing and suddenly it just shuts off. Three hours of Google support and three hours of HTC support yielded a big surprise. Cellphone Lifestyles is illegal selling Chinese tablets in the United States as US tablets. The rub is that your US warranty is void. What is upsetting is that Cellphone Lifestyles has no contact information and is shielded by Amazon they do not seem concerned that this illegal activity is going on with their full blessing. The lesson here is to buy Google branded items from the Google Store or only from an Amazon vendor that has a presence outside of Amazon.\n\nAs far as the device is concerned, other than the battery issue it is a perfect mid-size tablet.

I was considering a Samsung until a representative at Best Buy warned me that none of them have actual GPS anymore, only cellular telemetry, and as I am one who actually is known to carry a tablet away from cell service, navigation apps must still work.\n\nI appreciate the comfort of knowing that I have the official google tablet that will have timely updates.  In the past, I have used an Android phone that was locked down and never patched and in general, bloated and cluttered and that was solved by switching to an iPhone.  But for tablets, I'm still willing to try Android one more time.\n\nThe main weakness of this tablet is that it is very difficult to transfer files between my computer and tablet.  There is no SD card slot, which is really stupid.  But not only that, you can only send via bluetooth, but can't receive files because the tablet \"lacks the necessary services\".  Connecting via USB cable is unreliable and is successfully connected maybe 30% of the time (regardless of Windows, MacOS or Ubuntu).

I haven't done my homework properly and looked for reviews from trusted sources. I would say that it's fast, has high resolution, lightweight, Android Marshmallow.. But the one thing that will definitely let me think again about Google product is the light bleeding. It's horrible and I can't live with it. Especially that I would watch movies and youtubes a lot. All angles have bleedings, from top, and from sides. In a dark room you wouldn't see black.. Something grayish and purplish, bright spots and dark spots. That would be perfectly acceptable if it was a Chinese make, but it's Google!!! This is my first Google product and I totally dislike it!"}

It is so smooth and can handle anything you through at it with it's lightning fast processor. I had no problems with this device until about two to three months in. If I had known that it was made by HTC I wouldn't have bought it (I personally think they don't make great quality items and they tend to crap out quickly). The only things I don't like about it is it dies have some pretty bad overheating issues. You can't use it for decent periods of time and about two to three months in to me using it, it would crash. Not like anything I've seen before but it was as if it would just not know what to do so the screen would freeze, it would let out a very loud and ear piercing ring, and it would get hot enough to burn you. I researched online to see what was going on and I found out that the most \"understood\" reason on every forum I read was that it was a hardware bug. A really bad one too. Now to this day since I got mine in August I can only use it for about 20 minute increments before it gets super hot and if my battery gets below 50% it crashes. Now take a note that I generally used this as a gaming tablet which isn't what it's really made to do, maybe just some simple her and there games but probably not the ones that I was playing and that's on me, but it did run it all perfectly. I think it is a great house tablet with a nice screen size and beautiful display. I would prefer the nexus 7 over this however. Just due to its better overall quality and functionality."}

There are a lot of professional reviews out there you can easily find and read, and for the most part I agree with them.  The hardware is quite nice, and very comfortable to use for a tablet of this size.  The \"soft\" touch back is less \"soft\" than I was expecting - more of the texture of an egg shell than rubbery.  It works well - just soft enough to increase gripping texture, just matte enough to not show every fingerprint (at least, for this white version), but still smooth enough to slide freely across a desk or countertop.\n\nPerformance is excellent.  I've used iPads since they first came out, only recently shifting to Android devices, and this one performs on par with Apple's current hardware in all noticeable respects.  The specs for the Nexus 9 are very solid, and compete well with pretty much anything on the market at this time.\n\nThe screen is beautiful. Bright, clear, and colorful.  For those who pay attention to such things, there *is* some light bleed along the \"top\" edge of the screen (portrait mode), but it isn't anything that most folks will spot or care about in normal usage and isn't uncommon with backlit tablets.\n\nWhat makes the Nexus worth the price to me, though, is immediate access to the latest operating system upgrades from Google.  RIght out of the box this one started running system upgrades up to and including Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) - the current version as of this writing.  Coming from the Apple iOS world, where all devices get system updates when they become available, it is hard to put up with devices that don't until/unless its manufacturer (and/or carrier, in the case of cell phones) pushes out a version of the upgrade at some later date.  The Nexus 9 solves this frustration and will stay current longer as a result."}

The '9 'of course is fast compared to my  now damaged Nexus 7.  Other than that it's unimpressive and lacks features many current tablets in the same price range have.  The tablet becomes very hot to the touch after being on for only a few minutes, especially in the upper left corner of the tablet. After only three days of using the tablet I called Google about the overheating problem.  They tried very hard to blame the over heating  on downloaded apps,  I informed them I had not down loaded any apps and I had only  used the preinstalled apps. Google offered to send a replacement but after I asked if  it would be a new  tablet,  I declined as they stated it would be a refurbished device.  I returned the tablet. Also its pointless to get the tablet in white or Sand as the front of the tablet is black so when you put a case on the tablet it appears to be black."}

Battery life is sufficient, but could be better. With that said, I'm pretty sure I say that about every electronic device I've ever owned that had decent battery. We always want more, right?\n\nThis tablet is still fast enough for the things I use it for, which is mostly light internet and games. I don't do fps games on a tablet however, I have a ps4 for that. I'm talking about games like slot machines, flappy bird (remember that), candy crush and so on. So your experience may differ from mine.\n\nMy only complaint is the lack of a fast charge ability.

For some reason, Android phones seem to be quicker than Android tablets.  The update does narrow the gap, but there are still stutters and home screen reloads (out of memory?  Memory leak?  Bad memory management?)\n\nBuild quality of the Nexus 9 is not what you'd expect for a $500+ device.  The price is similar to the iPad (though you get more storage), but you don't get the higher quality materials or build.  The Nexus 9's build quality and feel is akin to the Nexus 5, so price-wise, it should have been similar (around $300 to 300).\n\nOtherwise, the speakers are good (front firing), the camera is just okay (8 MP, but still lots of noise, but it does have a flash), and the LCD has some edge bleed.  Again, it does not live up to the asking price."}

I contacted Google and they told me since this unit was made for the Chinese market there wasn't much they could do for me. To their credit, they sent me a new charger in the hopes that would fix the problem. Battery life got increasingly worse. A few days ago I got the OTA upgrade to Marshmallow. I installed it in the hopes that would fix the problem. This morning the battery went dead in less than two hours, with most of the time being spent unattended."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "They have corrected most if not all the issues from last year. There still is a slight backlight bleed but its barely noticeable in any situation other than boot up. The processor is fast and the screen is amazing. The only caveat is that you can't get the LTE version anymore. Google had a few in stock but they are mostly gone now. So WiFi only, but the WiFi is dual band ac so if you have a good router and fast internet, the experience is amazing.\n\nAdditionally if you are a prime member you can use the underground app and the amazon video app on the device. I have an iPad but at 350 bucks this is wY better value for money."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I like this tablet. It's the best Android tablet I've ever used. However, I have to deduct a couple of stars because of HTCs terrible quality control. The display has pretty bad light bleed. I've been reading that supposedly newer units don't have much lightbleed issues, but if I'm reading my device's serial number properly, it was built in September of 2015. That means it's pretty new, yet it still has the same bleeding backlight issues as earlier models. I kind of want to exchange but I don't know if I want to deal with the experience of getting another with light bleed in different areas. This tablet should cost half as much as it's being sold for right now. It's just not worth the MSRP.\n\nBesides that, it runs pretty smoothly, I didn't have any problems upgrading to 6.0 (I'll never understand how people ruin their devices when simply updating the OS. My only suspicion is that they turn it off part-way through the installation process because they lose patience, or they were updating on battery and it eventually ran out of juice.)"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "While I like the size and the screen, and I can tolerate the unbelievably bad button configuration, Android bugs made this a so-so performer. That was until last night, when an OTA update to Android 6.0 completely bricked the tablet. So far factory resets have been ineffective, Google forums have been unresponsive to dismissive, HTC hasn't responded yet, and I'm left with trying a (likely unsuccessful) flash of the device to factory settings. This happened to my primary reading device during the busiest time for me in recent memory. If you're a grown adult with responsibilities and don't have time for this nonsense, I suggest an iPad.\n\nUpdate-- HTC has set up a repair order. I have to find time to pay to ship it to them so they can reset it to factory conditions. I asked them if I could just return the unreliable POS to them, but that wasn't on the table. I think this will be the last time I trust a nexus branded product, and it will certainly be my last HTC product. An expensive waste of time and money that I may just discard. After all; even if they get it back to the marginal state it was in before it bricked, what's to keep it from bricking again with the next update? I may just have to eat the cost of this hunk of junk. Amazon; please create a no-stars option."}

I've experienced this in the past with HTC products, including their top-of-the-line smartphones: components fail quickly. In the case of the Nexus 9, assembly is cheap (back flexes very easily, screen has a lot of light leakage) and various components fail (such as screen orientation sensor). Given the tablet's low price, superb quality wasn't expected, but a little more attention to detail would have been welcome."}

While there is a lot to like about the Nexus 9 there is too much to dislike to recommend this product to others.\n\nPros:\n-Android operating system is far more customizable and powerful for a knowledgeable user.\n-Google Now has become a necessity in my life. I miss it when it is not available.\n-Possibly the best compromise size. Small and portable but big enough for movies and reading. Much prefered over the IPad Mini size.\n-Screen is bright and beautiful.\n-Sound is loud enough to use without headphones.\n-Charges with common USB Mini cable.\n-Enough memory for games, utility apps, and all the movies I need to carry with me.\n-Nexus so true Android experience without bloatware.\n-Handsome.\n\nCons:\n-WILL NOT UPDATE TO NEWEST OPERATING SYSTEM!! This is a Nexus. I bought it over other devices so that updating would be early and easy. Android 5.1.1 system update is downloaded but I can't get it to install! I've even tried wiping the device (at some inconvenience) and still won't update. To make matters worse there is a permanent reminder that the update is sitting there.\n-Feels sluggish at times.\n-Not enough battery life and charges way too slow.\n-Power button next to volume button means that I often turn device off when I'm trying to turn it up.\n\nSummary: Still my go to device despite having an IPad Mini, the flaws, especially not updating, made me wish I bought a different Android tablet. Unfortunately, probably the last HTC device I will buy."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "When my iPad 2 (5 years old) finally died, I started to look for a new replacement tablet. Since I already have an Android phone, I thought I'd go with an Android tablet to match rather than stick with iPad. I refused to pay the same price as the iPad though for an Android Tablet, so I looked at all the options and went with the Nexus 9. Having an original Nexus 7 in the past, I was reluctant about the quality though.\n\nOverall, I was impressed with the tablet. The most stand out thing I notice are the front facing speakers. Why don't all the other tablets have this? For my iPad and Nexus 7, if I wanted to hear the audio from my Netflix or Youtube videos, I'd have to cup my hand around back so I could hear better. This tablet blasts the sound right at you. The feel of the device was nice, pretty light and slim, although the edges are a bit rough on the hands after a while. The screen looks amazing. Looking at other reviews of the device, it seems as though they were having problems making consistent displays that looked good, but I guess HTC worked out all the kinks out of the systems now.\n\nPros:\n1) Great sound\n2) Slim form factor\n3) Very good performance - sure you can get a better processor and more ram but you'll pay more. This has smoothly chugged through everything I threw at it\n4) Long lasting battery life - I get all day battery performance and the standby mode is great (running Marshmallow)\n5) Knock to turn on - my favorite software feature, just double tap the screen to turn on the device, no more searching for the power button\n6) Quickly get the latest updates to Android\n\nCons:\n1) Edges are a little sharp, not noticeable unless you're holding it for a long time.\n2) While battery life is great for an Android tablet, it's still about 2 hours shy of my old iPad\n\nOverall, I think it's a very solid device and would recommend it for someone who wants an inexpensive but still powerful tablet."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I infrequently write reviews but HTC's lack of service deserved airing. I have been a long time Android fan and currently use the Nexus 6 & 9, after experiences with different manufacturers I found found that pure Android best suits me.\n\nI used the store demo unit at Best Buy which does not even come close to demonstrating the power and usability of this product due to the awkward demo software.  Hands down this is the best mobile device I have every owned (until it wasn't).  Perfect sized for everything from Netflix to Excel and taking notes in a meeting.  Great display and ample battery life.  So motivated that I purchased one for both my Mom and Dad so they wouldn't fight over just having one in their house.\n\nBefore purchasing I read about potential device issues, but avoided those for the first four months.  Occasional freeze became daily, then hourly.  I called HTC which had a very low understanding of the product and even less knowledge about how one might fix it.  After running their tests I am unable to do anything including a factory reset.  Now they want me to ship them the unit at my cost so they can \"repair\".  Before you are even allowed to get a ticket they run you through their LENGTHY verbal terms and conditions.  It's easy to tune out, but I did get the sense they were going to blame this on me and invent new fees.\n\nIn the old days Google carefully choose, managed and QA'd their flagship hardware line -- not now.  Tighter control of the product and service is badly needed.\n\n--------------------------\n\nUpdate:  Through HTC support I shipped the Nexus 9 back to the manufacturer at my cost.  As best I can tell they simply flashed the device.  After return within about 30 minutes I was having the same problems with crashing.  I tried resetting back to factory default and even then simply opening Chrome would cause a system crash.  Working with HTC customer support was really frustrating so it took a couple months to work up the energy..... Now HTC is trying to NOT honor the warranty based on their ship date to the retailer.  If you do a quick web search you will find that these issues are well documented and Google/HTC has not done well to fix the problems for their customers.\n\n----------\nUpdate 1/12/2016 Received a brick back from HTC.  Extremely time confusing.  Worthless customer support response."}

After my Samsung Tab S died in an unfortunate drowning accident, I was looking for something a little smaller in size and closer to stock Android. I looked at both the Nexus 7 & 9. I was afraid the 7's screen would be to small after using the Tab S 10.1\" screen so I went with the Nexus 9 and couldn't be happier.\n\nThe screen size is just right and the tablet is not to big to carry around unlike the Tab S which was always a little too big for me. I read several reviews about light leaking around the edge of the bezel but mine doesn't have any. I purchased my Nexus 9 in August 2015 and is the 32gb model with LTE capability,  although I'm only using wifi. I ordered the wifi only model but received the LTE version for the same price! Lucky me.\n\nThe Nexus 9 is fast and very responsive. I didn't do any measured tests like some of the reviewers however I can tell you that when I tab an app to open it, it immediately opens without delay. On my Tab S,  there was a delay especially when opening my Gmail.\n\nDisplay is crisp and sharp and all the colors look very good. To be honest, I don't really see a difference between it and the Tab S. If I was going to put them side by side then maybe I could tell a difference and who knows who the winner would be since my Tab S is DOA (My fault not Samsung's). As with most TVs, unless they are side by side or one is really terrible,  most people don't complain or can tell the difference.\n\nAfter a few days of use, I'm very happy with this Nexus 9 tablet and actually like it more than my Samsung Tab S. I see no problems with build quality at all. And the two front facing speakers are awesome! They sound way better than the Tab S. The Tab S were on the side and I had to cup my hands around them  to hear them clearly sometimes."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "It is a very nice tablet--I think the later builds solved some of the initial quality and build problems.\n\nIt is very fast and efficient.  In my experience the ARM processors still are a bit more efficient than some of the x86 ATOM processors showing up in some newer android tablets.\n\nMy main use for the device was reading color PDFs of larger documents. With moon reader pro--it did a great job and loaded pages very quickly.  Compared to the Dell 7000 series 10 inch tablet (with an atom processor) there was an obvious difference. The nexus 9 was much faster.\n\nThe problems\n\n1) Google hates expandable storage, so no micro sd card slot.  While you can get a nexus 6 with 64 gig of storage, this particular tablet maxes out at 32 gig.  In 2015 with larger files, thats a huge issue. Not everyone has access to the cloud 24/7.\n2) This particular tablet has a faster nvidia processor that is hyped for graphics and gaming performance. But the newer games are quite large in size.  Only 32 gig is not enough and store media/files/music\n\nSo I liked the tablet but given the expense and the cost vs storage ratio, I did opt to return it.  I really WANT to like it, but lack of storage options was annoying. Yes I could OTG to a usb stick to store music and  media but seems to defeat the purpose of having a self-contained tablet.\n\nWill wait for the samsung tablet s2 to see what they offer in terms of size, speed, and storage options."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I bought this because I wanted a tablet that could use Android games because my Kindle Fire HD 6 couldn't. While the Nexus 9 can run those games, it drains the battery pretty fast. One problem I've been having is the battery suddenly going to zero and shutting my device down when it was just previously charged to above 20%. The percentage is never the same. Sometimes I had a lot of charge left, others it was below half. Either way, the battery wasn't at 0 really. I have to charge it for a few minutes and turn it back on and it will show the battery where it should actually be. Not 0. If I check the battery under settings, it shows a sudden drop to zero from where it was and a jump back up after I restart it. It did that today even when I had it charging at the same time. I don't know if my battery is just faulty or if they all do this. It keeps happening more and more. It takes a very long time, in my opinion, for the battery to charge. 5 or more hours, longer if I am using it. My Fire doesn't take that long, even when I'm still playing on it.\n\nMy Nexus 9 does get worryingly hot in the top, left corner. Part of my concern for my battery. It seems this, at least, is a common thing.\n\nIts size is nice for playing games compared to my Kindle HD Fire 6, which is a better size for reading e-books given that it is about the size of a paperback. The Nexus is about twice the size of my Kindle Fire. The bigger screen makes it easier to tap things in-game. For its size, it is not too heavy to comfortably hold in one hand.\n\nI do have an issue with my case I bought for it. When I open it, it usually doesn't auto-wake. I have to hit the power button to wake it up and then once I slide the screen to unlock it, it goes back to sleep and I have to repeat the process. I don't know if it's the case or the tablet that is mostly at fault but I'm thinking the tablet.\n\nIts size is nice but the problems I've had with the battery are terrible. If it wasn't for the battery, I'd give it 4*. It gets too hot for me to give it all 5*. I'm going to see if I can't trade it for a new one and see how that one works. Hopefully I just have a bad battery. I've had it less than 6 months so I'll try to see if it's just this particular battery or tablet or if it's just Nexus 9."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "ETA(2):  To summarize: Thought I was getting a WIFI only tablet based on title; long description said it was LTE version; it WAS the LTE tablet; it WAS unlocked; and it accepted a carrier's SIM card with no problem.  I added a star back because the power button issues are completely gone.  (I'm wondering if some residue from my new tablet cover got in there as it has left some sticky stuff on my screen.)  I love the tablet.  Fast. Scrolls evenly.  Updated to 5.1 with no issues. Battery has been great. Great aspect ratio for reading.\n\nFinally got some feedback from the seller (Cellphone Lifestyles), so added a star back for that as well.  They are insisting this won't work with Verizon (my carrier) as it is GSM only (even though the description says CDMA and GSM).  Not sure why they keep insisting it is GSM only.\n\nI took this to T-Mobile (my first interaction with them...what a great company!) today and they put a SIM card in and the tablet works perfectly on their network. I am currently taking advantage of their free data plan for life (200MB per month); I wanted to see what signal strength I had at home before committing to anything further.  Went with T-Mobile because the data is free (it's not much, but it's free for life and 99% of the time, I use the tablet on wireless anyway) and was an easy way to test the network in my neighborhood.\n\nETA(1):  I did, indeed, get the LTE version.  Not an issue except I keep getting a \"no sim card\" error.  BE CAREFUL and read the ENTIRE description for these tablets, as different vendors apparently use the same title (that says WIFI only) but some sell the LTE version.  I can't use this with Verizon, but T-mobile has free data, so I might as well sign up for that.\n\nThe tablet is reasonably well built. I have no light bleed and no concavity in the back of the case (as many have complained about)  I have been having issues with the power button.  It seems to be recessed in too far or something and doesn't like to work.  I bought a case that turns it on/off when it opens/closes, so that isn't a huge issue for me.  Some have commented that HTC fixed this issue in later builds, but since I have an LTE model, which was built later, apparently they didn't get the job done.  I don't particularly care for the power adapter. It's not square like most; it's rectangular (about 2.5\" long and 1.5\" wide) and sticks out from the wall too far.\n\nI'm taking away one star because of the power button issue.  I'm taking away one star because the supplier (Cellphone Lifestyle) hasn't responded adequately to my questions.\n\nOriginal post:\nI'll change this review if I can get my issue settled.  Ordered this tablet, assuming it was a WIFI only tablet (that's what is says in the title AND in the technical details).  Got an LTE tablet (in all honesty, the description DID say LTE but NOT in the normal place to look for it, as least when I bought it... even now, if you click on \"more product details\" there is nothing about it being LTE).  So now I continually get a \"no sim card\" error.  Trying to find out if this is \"unlocked\" and if it can be used with my carrier if I ever decide to do that."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I've bought a HTC Nexus 9 (32GB) version direct from Google waiting quite some time before writing a review to fully dog the hell out of the device to see how it held up over time. Understand that this review is based on actual \"in the wilds\" use and not initial reactions shortly after purchase or clueless speculation.\n\nThe Good -\nVery well built. Light weight. Good use of materials. Easy to hold in the hand. Solid with no give.\nNvidia Tegra K1 silicon gives the N9 kick. 64 Bit support, 60 frames per second UI and fast performance.\nSound Quality. Speakers deliver impressive sound especially considering it's a tablet. Thank HTC.\nBattery life is good overall but varies depending on task. Ex. Running ArtFlow for extended periods can drain the battery faster than normal.\nScreen quality is great. Excellent resolution 2048x1536 218 ppi. Clear with rich colors and good blacks. Great viewing angles.\nTouch response is great. The touch response problems of the Nexus 7 2013 are not present here.\nForm factor. I wasn't a fan of a 4:3 ratio coming from 16:9 but it's grown on me. Easier to work in landscape AND portrait.\n\nThe Bad -\nHeat. Tegra KI is a capable performer inside the N9 but it causes the device to get hot. It's not subtle.\nOnly 2GBs of RAM. For a device of this caliber I was expecting 4GBs.\nNo 64GB storage option. I didn't think I'd need more than 32GBs of local storage until I saw what high end games look like on the device. Considering some mobile games clock in at 2GBs or larger, the more local storage the better.\n*Android Beam is wonky. It works flawlessly on my Nexus 7 2012, Nexus 7 2013 and my Nexus 5. It almost never works on the Nexus 9.\n\nI'm no stranger to Nexus devices as I joined the ranks of Android shortly after the G1 debuted and have purchased the Nexus 1, Galaxy Nexus, Motorola Xoom (technically a Nexus device), Nexus 7 2012, Nexus 7 2013, Nexus 5, Nexus 9 and the Nexus player. I stick with Nexus devices because I absolutely hate skinned Android devices. Too much crapware, terrible update cycles and ugly as sin designs. I needed a new tablet as my Nexus 7 2013 was getting long in the tooth. It served me well overall though so I had no reason to abandon the Nexus line. I grabbed a Nexus 9 with the tan back from Google Play. The initial setup is as straight forward as any other Google device. Set up Wifi, log in with your Google account, use auto back up and restore (if you have it enabled) and you're golden.\n\nI use my Nexus tablets mostly for artwork creation using a Wacom Bamboo Stylus, some gaming and some productivity through various Google apps and now Microsoft Office apps. The Nexus 9 has not disappointed in any of these areas even after months of hard use. Performance is very smooth not just in basic UI navigation but also within the apps themselves. I use a lot of ArtFlow and Sketchbook on my Nexus 9 and both performed admirably although ArtFlow is more stable. The glitches I've experienced with Sketchbook are minor but a reflection of the app not the hardware as they are the same glitches I've had running the app on the Nexus 7 2013.\n\nPlaying videos through YouTube, Netflix, Google Movies+TV, locally stored content or movies from Google Drive all played without problems and displays beautifully on the Nexus 9 screen. To be fair, my locally stored and Drive videos are all in .MP4 format. In the past, during the times of the Xoom, I ran RockPlayer which supported Xvid, Dixv, .flv .mov etc but I gave up on it for a universally supported format (.MP4) that will run on any smartphone or tablet I purchase without jumping through any hoops. If you have an exotic collection of formats for your videos then I can't say if they will run native on the Nexus 9 or not. If I had to guess, I'd say \"no\" but don't quote me on that. With that in mind, I also run my music from Google Music All Access. This too, performs without problems and sounds better than expected through the front facing speakers on the Nexus 9. In the past I ran music locally but learned how ridiculous it is constantly transferring music from one device to the next in this non micro-SD card/cloud storage age Google has chosen. But if you do run your music locally, then I strongly suggest PowerAmp over Google Music. It's an excellent audio app for Android. Even answering phone calls and text messages over WIFI from the Nexus 9 works without issue but this isn't such a stretch considering that functionality works great on the Nexus 7 (or any Android tablet for that matter) provided you have an active Google Voice number.\n\nThe only issues I've had with the Nexus 9 are the mentioned heat issues, transferring files through Android Beam almost never working and issues specific to Android 5x. I've noticed the heat issues mostly when connecting a PS3 controller to the device through OTG cable to play various games and at times when using art apps for extended periods. Android Beam is a point of frhstration. It's a simple concept. Transfer data between two devices using NFC. Except when i attempt to do this with the Nexus 9 and say, my Nexus 7 2013, the initial prompt works with the accompanying notification sound, but the Nexus 7 will immediately be put to sleep. At first I thought I hit the power button by accident but I can reproduce that result at will. Only a handful of times has the transfer actually worked. This is a huge negative for me as I use Android Beam a lot to transfer sketches and image files. The work around is to install Quikpic on both devices and use WIFI transfer instead of Android Beam. This function works exactly like Android Beam but cuts NFC out of the equation entirely using the WIFI network as the bridge. Obviously, both devices have to be on the same network. As far as Android 5x is concerned,\n\n1) I hate the new white panel notifications in Android 5.0. I installed the app HeadsOff which re-enables the Android notifications from Android 1x - 4x.\n2) Google Now launcher is good. Very good. But it's lacking in terms of customization. I installed Nova Launcher Prime and customized the icons, transition animations, app tray, custom gestures and grid size to my heart's content.\n3) Android 5.0 lock screen notifications didn't sit well with me either. I installed Dynamic Notifications to change those to my liking.\n\nThat's it for the most part. I really like the Nexus 9 as the positives far outweigh the negatives and believe HTC, Nvidia and Google did a great job with the device overall. It has performed exceptionally well in everything I've asked it to do with the exception of NFC transfers, with the only other negatives being the occasional heat build up, 2GB of RAM instead of 4 (I'm always greedy for more RAM) and no 64GB storage SKU. Everything else I've had problems with were because of Android Lollipop itself and can be changed through customization. I've read the issues many people had with the device running Android 5.0 on it. I bought my Nexus 9 just when Android 5.1 started rolling out so I skipped many of the issues others were having. This is why this review doesn't have any tales of woe except for the NFC lameness.\n\n4*"}

It is also probably a bit less than precision when it comes to matching the frame, at least compared to a Samsung S (which this is replacing).

However, at 60 my eyes get tired in the evening when I want to read and the Nexus 7 was just a little small.  I looked at the 10 inch and 12 inch tables but there were a little heavy and a tad bit too big so I stayed with the Nexus 7.  That was until the Nexus 9 came out and it is the PERFECT size for me.  Not too heavy and yet the screen and type are big enough to ready without getting tired too quickly.  I highly recommend the Nexus 9."}

Also if you just straight up use the battery it's dead in around 4-6 hours depending on what you're using it for.\n\nAll that said I really enjoy this tablet, the size is spot on. The picture is solid. The speakers are some of the best in the tablet world. I like the look and feel of the white one. I really enjoy this tablet, but if you are considering buying one I might suggest not. It's about 8 month old now and a newer one should be coming out in the fall, so I don't reccomend it at  this point.\n\nAll said if you are looking for the best android tablet in the game, look no further, but be warned you may be jumping on something soon to be obsolete."}

Why Google feels the need to completely change the feel each time a new device comes out is mind boggling. While this device has great hardware, it lacks features, like  HDMI, that many of us enjoyed on the Nexus 10. And because they skipped a large tablet for a while, to patiently wait for the next one to come out and return it after a day was disappointing. And don't even get me started on the Nexus 6... Not everyone wants a phablet!!! Google, stop desperately trying to force innovation and take a page from Apple's book and focus on consistency and reliability year to year."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I do love this tablet, it just much more (probably fake) weight though the weight does make it feel more substantial.  Though having taken many tablets apart to replace screens, connectors, etc I know the couple boards and chip-sets inside barely take up all the space in a phone, and tablets all use the same chip sets so all tablets do have a significant amount of empty space inside.  This isn't a diss this is just how things are these days.  What should be done is that extra space should be used to strengthen the casing of the tablet, and from what I can tell the Nexus 9 is definitely more sturdy than the Nexus 7 2013 of which I've very carefully replaced the screen on twice now.\nThe Nexus 9 is a very fast tablet, though I do get occasional app crashes particularly some games occasionally and sometimes Firefox.  I'm not sure what is causing these crashes (I'm not currently rooted or running CM or any other ROM, I'm just on standard un-rooted 5.1.1, though I plan on trying CM soon so I can have easy access to the scheduler and I/O options without flashing a separate kernel) I should go in and read the logs to see what is faulting right before but I have been to lazy to do this.\nA complaint I have about the NEXUS 9 is that it gets (very) hot in the top left corner in standard landscape mode even while just browsing and all other apps force closed out.  this is bothersome and I think once I flash a different ROM on here I will limit the clock-speed and maybe the voltage as also sometimes the battery drains faster than at other times with no change in apps being used or screen brightness as evidenced by the battery gauge curve.  I have to learn the ins and outs of android 5, I was good with 2 and had learned a bit of the inner workings of 4 but it seems a lot of the log files and others binaries have changed or been moved around.  I kind of wish Google would standardize what they are doing, it is just Linux which I do understand very well but it is annoying they have to make a special programming system just to write java code and basic Linux knowledge is only somewhat helpful at the basic level."}

The reasons I'm rating it three stars are that 1. Amazon extended the shipping so that it came like a week later than it should have (don't really mind I guess), and 2. I ordered a 32 GB version and when I plugged it into my computer, it says that there was only 25.6 GBs of space and like 4 GBs of space is already used just for the system apps and stuff like that which only left about 21 GB of space for me to use.\n\nUPDATE: Okay, so when I ordered this tablet, I thought I was going to get the newer version were all the major problems were fixed but it turns out I didn't. I got the one with the annoying buttons that are ridiculously hard to press, bad screen bleeding (not too bad I guess), and the really weak front magnets that can't support the Magic Cover. It also freezes and is pretty slow at times plus the battery isn't the best. These are problems with the tablet but they were fixed by HTC and so I ordered the tablet on Amazon about 6 months after these problems were fixed and I still got the old one. I'm really angry. The actual tablet is pretty great but Amazon messed up big time."}

I've had issues with other devices over the years...). Battery life is good, but I haven't tried watching movies while camping either. I mean, I'm camping after all.\n\nThe Bad: You want a nine-inch display, don't expect it to fit in your pocket, or even in your cargo pocket. No SD/XD/whatever memory card slot. You can expand using the USB so that's not \"Bad\" per se but I like the ability to add additional memory or have dedicated cards for different uses, such as \"moves to distract toddler\". The display brightness is insufficient for California Sunshine (tm), but then all LED/LCD displays I've worked with are. Go with an E-Ink if you want to read your eBook in the Caribbean while tanning.\n\nThe Ugly: Uh... nothing. It's been really solid.\n\nI purchased it specifically for its connection to Google, as I am a software developer and needed (yet another) target device. Failures and issues have not been with the hardware or O/S, but with software (I'm looking at you, Adobe...). And that lack of a card slot. Macintosh SE 30 all over again.\n\nWould I purchase it again? Yes. Would I purchase it again at the price I paid without my business subsiding it? Er... no. Price point is a little high for me. Has software development on Android been a trying experience? Yes, as this old dog needs to learn, yet again, new tricks to solve the software problems I encountered 30 years ago.

I have had Nexus 4 and Nexus 6 and did not face so many problems ever.\n\nThe Nexus 9 had \"light bleed\" problems out of the box but I chose to ignore them because it did not matter to me as much (light used to bleed at the edges only on a totally black screen). After about 15 days of use the side buttons started feeling flimsy and \"too much into\" the tablet. But I chose to ignore even this because I was loving the Android 5.0 and the 9 inch screen and probably because I was a Google lover! At this time the tablet used to give about 5-6 hours of On screen time and I could manage charging it once or twice during the day and using it ....But....\n\nIn a few months, the battery started to die out sooner and sooner and by May it just gave 1.5-2 hours of screen use time. This is after taking 5-6 hours to charge completely. Also, one of the corners of the device gets so hot that it almost feels like it is burning.\n\nIn June when I had enough of this Nexus 9 nonsense, I contacted HTC for a replacement - the customer service representative says, and I quote \"It is the first time I am hearing about light bleed and battery life problems on our Nexus 9 model\" !!!?! He was completely oblivious to the fact that the internet is full of users experiencing exactly the same problem. I don't know why it is so hard for a company as big as HTC to accept its manufacturing defect and work on it! He inturn implied that I had done something to the tablet to make it drain battery life faster and to get heated up...he also implied that the light bleed might infact be a \"liquid damage\" committed by me. I closed my \"live chat\" window after this nonsense.\n\nNext, I contacted Google to help me with the tablet. The customer rep was really polite but was completely unhelpful \"because sir you did not purchase it directly from the Google Store\".\n\nThankfully, Amazon is a much better company than these crooks and accepted to take this tablet back. Lets see how it goes from here.\n\nHonest opinion - DO NOT BUY NEXUS 9!! You will regret it sooner or later. There are loads of better and cheaper android tablets out there in the market. I have a Lenovo Tab S8-50 and have never had these issues with that tablet."}

I am somewhat disappointed in the Nexus 9 though.\n\nI spent a long time weighing whether to buy the 9. Finally my desire to have an Android tablet that is larger than the 7 won out.\n\nThe good:\n\n1. I love the size. I have big hands but it still comfortably fits in one hand.\n2. The back material that some say is flimsy feels fine to me. It is in fact \"plastic-y\" but I don't mind that. I like the slight rubbery feel. It's not slick and hard to hold onto like metal.\n3. The screen looks great to me. True, there are tablets with better screens, but I'm not using this for Photoshop design or anything...just surfing,  reading,  and the occasional game or YouTube video.\n4. Of course the big win is immediate Android updates.\n\nThe bad:\n\n1. Battery life is just sad. Understandably a bigger screen and better processor will mean shorter battery life than the 7,  but I was not prepared for it to drain as fast as it does. I will probably never use it for serious reading as I did with my 7 due to this fact.\n2. IT GETS HOT! Mainly it just happens in the upper right hand corner around the camera lens. When I say hot, I mean uncomfortably hot. I guess after reading about the battery heat issues on the HTC One, I really should have expected it.\n\nSo I can't say this is a great buy, but I can't say it's totally bad either. However I would think Google would want to pull out all the stops in terms of going up against the iPad and galaxy series. I also don't understand why,  since the 7 was such a great tablet, why they didn't just continue using Asus.\n\nBottom line....

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I really hate Lollipop and wanted to wait until the 5.1.1 update to review the N9. It fixes a lot of the lag, but I still have to restart it every couple of days or it becomes unusable. Ive owned the N7 2012 and still own the 2013 and there are days when my N7 2013 runs circles around my N9.\n\nThe hardware is pretty typical of HTC, and thats good and bad. Its good because it has a good screen, decent speakers, and respectable build quality. Please note that I did not get one with light bleed and other quality issues. It is bad because HTC decided to play it safe (again) and didn't add any features to distinguish it in any way. Which means all the bad things about the tablet stick out, both literally and figuratively.\n\nThe buttons are partially covered by the edge making them harder to press. Theres no wireless charging. The lowest screen brightness is almost blinding in total darkness, making casual viewing without waking up a light-sensitive bed partner impossible. The LED only blinks when the battery is low unless you root your device. If you want to check your notifications or make sure your tablet is charging, you can supposedly tap on the screen twice (or in my case two to six times) to show your entire screen, instead of simply relying on the LED. Which drains more battery, a blinking LED like on the N7 or a screen you have to actually turn on every time to check for notifications? Hmmm, let me think.\n\nOut of the box, the battery life is not great. I changed a setting to kill the wifi when the tablet is sitting unused. Before this I was getting about a day of battery life, even when I didn't pick up the tablet for the entire day. Now I get about 3 days out of it with moderate use. However, with this setting enabled the wifi sometimes will not come back on unless I restart the tablet. While some people praise the size, I still find myself reaching for my N7 2013 simply because it is easier to handle.\n\nIf you are looking to upgrade to the N9 from the N7 2012 or you need a larger tablet, go for it. If you are upgrading from the N7 2013, you might be better off waiting to see if Google does anything else this year (2015) because you probably won't notice any significant difference in performance."}

Tablet is extremely buggy, tablets crashes, freezes up requiring hard reset, and the biggest issue MEMORY LEAK. The device pretty functions as if it has no RAM at all. Everytime you want to go home you have to wait at least 2 seconds, sometimes as long as 5-8 seconds and you can clearly see the homescreen has to reload the background and icons slowly because it doesn't exist in the RAM for quick reload. Also multitasking is impossible due to this as well. No matter how small the app, if you move to another app and try to go back, it will pretty much be very slow and/or reload the entire app as if it was force closed. Sometimes i come home to find the tablet completely frozen even though it hasn't been used. Expect to have to reset this tablet at minimum every other day to maintain a somewhat functional experience (if it didn't crash and needs a reset anyway)\nAlso the quality control on these units is very poor.

I had nexus one through nexus 4 and everything in between that was android. In a dilemma between iPad Air 2 and Nexus 9 my obvious choice was to go for Android. HTC let me down completely. I had some volume key issues (infamous) with my HTC Nexus One. I had to replace it twice during its life for a huge price (once during warranty and once out of warranty).\n\nEven with my bad hardware experience with Nexus one in the past, I decided to go for Nexus 9. Let me start with the positives;\n\n*Speakers were good (Front facing dual side)\n*Handy form-factor at 8.9 inches\n*Good price @ Amazon during a promo\n\nNow lets get to the downsides (and its a huge list unfortunately)\n\n*Light Bleed (So much that it makes you feel for the money you spent on this one)\n*Slow Charging - Charges For Ever. It takes ~ 5.30 to 6 hours to charge fully. Android lollipop tells you how much time remaining to charge fully and it bothers\n*Little too slow for the advertised specs\n*Personally not too happy with the camera. Skype sessions were not too great. But can live with it.\n*Auto-Rotate - The Gyro sensor has some serious issues with this HTC release (Lots of people in google forums complain of this issue. They either had a replacement or returned. I returned mine back to Amazon due to this issue at some loss - since I had this one for 2 months. There are youtube videos that guide you to open the back cover and do something - Really !!!).\n\nThis issue was the saturation point for me. I cud live with other problems but really couldn't put-up with this as it would stick to one mode (landscape/portrait). I had to do hard reset to get it back working. But the problem would recur sooner or later. And BTW beware of factory reset - This one takes more than 1 hour for factory reset !!!!\n\nI called Amazon and they processed the refund with a restocking fee deduction since it was past 30 days. My advise: Please do not buy HTC products. They have way too many issues with hardware. Not sure what Google is doing in terms of QC. Ideally I would like HTC to bear the cost. They make crappy devices.\n\nBottomline: Too Pricey for what it promises. Too many issues to live with."}

I wanted this tablet for school work mostly, but I wanted something that would run intense graphic games really well. Because school is the priority, I needed a tablet that was better at the essential functions, web browsing, document access, no lag between apps, stuff like that.

So far I've had no issues and this version of Android is very polished.  I have a Galaxy S6 (and owned other Android devices) and the interface was very intuitive and easy to get into.\n\nCons\n* Coming from a 7 in tablet before, this almost seemed too big to wield sometimes.  Maybe that's personal preference, but after using this, I'd go back to 7 in on my next tablet purchase.\n* Poor battery life and long recharge time.  Full recharge seems to take 5-6 hours, and the battery will not charge when used while plugged in.  I seem to think there's a problem with standby, my old tablet generally would have the same battery life as the last time I put it down, this tablet seems to noticeably discharge if you set it down and come back to it the next day.  Mine is WiFi only and it shouldn't really be running intensive apps that need to check in constantly, so I doubt it's something I'm doing.\n* The screen scratched somehow 10 seconds after I got it.  I did set it screen down at my desk at work, and it got an inch long scratch right in the middle of the screen.  It has never scratched anywhere after that, but it's a minor annoyance.  Most of the time I don't even notice the scratch, but my last tablet I had over a year and had no scratches, this thing was scratched by the time it was out of the box.\n\nI have bought a stylus pen (ifrogz and cost me $10 at wal-mart) for touchscreens and that has helped immensely with the size of the device where it's sometimes difficult to reach all the way across the screen.\n\nAll in all, I'm happy with this thing, but it didn't blow me away.  Finally I know I opted for the 16GB model because the prices are outrageous just for a bit more HDD space, but 16 GB is too small and I definitely have to manage apps and constantly delete things."}

I've been using Android tablets since the very beginning, and despite all the \"butter\" features in the OS, I've come to the conclusion that Android OS just isn't as slick as some make it out to be.

It's an overall good experience, but in all honestly, I've come to like the Windows tablet OS better (I also own a Surface Pro 3 - much more intuitive and more responsive, IMHO).\n\nThe tablet itself is quality construction, but it's limited in a sense by the OS it runs. Not a killer of anything (iPad or otherwise), in my opinion. I like the display aspect ratio, and I do use it everyday, but only for consumption. I create content with the SP3.\n\nBattery life is okay, but at times disperses rapidly for no apparent reason. Definitely better batter life than the Nexus 7, though not at the SP3 or iPad level, but still worth a few days between charges (at least with my usage). It feels decent in the hand. Sounds is okay, not great. Touch is very responsive, and the colors are very sharp.\n\nAll-in-all, the tablet almost feels like an afterthought from Google. They don't seem to have much direction with their tablets at this point and seem to just be throwing offerings at the wall to see if something sticks... kind of like Samsung. I think the entire line of Android tablets is suffering from this ATM, though. If you're looking for a good Android tablet, though, this is a good one, if not a little overpriced IMHO."}

If you have embraced cloud storage, 32GB should fit the bill and 2 GB of RAM is adequate with the K1 processor. The warm spot is there but so far it's nothing worth griping over. Speakers are proficient and do their job. Overall, it's legit and has a strong build. I've also never owned a white device like an iPhone or Galaxy, always opted for black. I got the lunar white because it was a little cheaper and it's surprisingly nice looking. If you're committed to android and Google, I see no reason to choose something else.

Had a Nexus 7 before this (it died like many others I've read about) so I was a little hesitant at first.  But when I realized HTC is manufacturing the 9, my hesitation went away.  I have an HTC phone and have had NO problems with it.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Android so before this purchase, I tried the Samsung Note Pro 12.2. Samsung's UI looked messy and cluttered and there was considerable lag.  I also tried out the iPad Air 2 and, well, it's an iPad and I just don't care for iOS.\n\nThe GN9 is pure Android Lollipop.  Uncomplicated, uncluttered, and fast!  The front facing speakers are plenty loud and are great for watching movies.  The size of the device is perfect as well.  So far, so good and I would definitely recommend it to others."}

When you compare it to a newer ipad or android samsung tablet, the Nexus 9 seems like its behind a few years. Perhaps the extra thickness is there to accommodate the 6600mhz battery.\nWhich by the way, does nothing to fuel battery life.\nYes...when idle, the battery holds its battery life quite well.\nBut if you're using the tablet, it will run out of battery more or less as fast as any other tablet. Approx 3/4 to a day of use, depending.\n\nWhat I cant stand though, is how incredibly laggy and buggy it is.\nOften, I think: \"oh...maybe its the connection\" or \"maybe the play store is having issues\"\nNope.\nI have all these other android devices sitting right here, connected to the same wifi, and none are experiencing the Nexus 9 issues, often running the same OS version too.\n\nLike others have mentioned, one day it will be working fine, then the next day, all the screen tap response times falls back to 3-4 seconds.\nMeaning...I tap the HOME button........then wait 3-4 seconds for it to respond.\nSame goes for the In App button, taking an extra long time to bring up the list of open apps.\n\nWhen I see this happening, i always consider that maybe its something I have running in the background that could possibly be making this occur.\nThere are plenty of times (such as right now) where I have nothing open on the tablet, and I even power cycled the device.\nIts just simply running like crap.\nIf you had a first generation tablet, like the samsung galaxy 1, think of it in those terms.\nJust super terrible and laggy.\nId say this happens to me about once a week, then....it will go away.\nAnd often, this is with no apps running, getting updated, or having a bunch of things open and idling in the background.\n\nSo....if you HAVE to have this tablet, i guess go buy it.\nI wish I hadnt.\nLike others...im hoping the 5.1 update will fix this device.\nIts funny...they brag about it being the first 64 bit device, with powerful processing and RAM.\nMaybe its in there, but its not getting used!\nIve never seen ANYTHING exclusive that the Nexus 9 can do over other tablets.\n\nLastly....I also have the Folio Keyboard for this device.\nWhat a joke.\nThe keyboard sucks even more!!\nThey charge 120.00 for that thing, and id say its worth about 30.00.\nI do not recommend the Nexus 9 until it works better, probably requiring a serious update.\nI REALLY, REALLY do not recommend the keyboard."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "After reading reviews on Amazon and external sites and consulting with other tablet users, I decided on the Google Nexus 9. I almost bought a Kindle Fire, but I didn't want constant ads. I already have an android phone, so this tablet seemed like a logical choice. Tablet size was important to me. I needed something portable and light weight. 10 inches would have been a bit too big and heavy for my needs. 7 or 8 inches would have been too small. This 9 inch tablet is perfect for me. I opted to spend a bit more money for the 32GB of storage.\n\nOut of the box, the tablet goes through some initial system upgrades. This may take awhile. You get to watch the cute little animated android robot move as the system upgrades are installed. This made the process a bit more entertaining for me.\n\nI like being able to fully customize the screen. My screen looks cleaner now that I removed all of the desktop app shortcuts. I found a really nifty free wallpaper app and a free customizable clock app in the Google Play store. The standard clock display is fine, but I wanted something that would stand out more. I was hoping for more installed wallpapers, but I guess that doesn't matter since there are lots of great free wallpapers out there. I would like to be able to more easily view my remaining battery life. There is a tiny little battery icon on top of the screen, but it is a little awkward to access. [Edit: Found a great battery indicator widget for free in the Google Play store which I am now using. Much better!]\n\nI will be taking my tablet to class to view PowerPoint presentations, jot down a few reminders, read PDF documents, and check email. I was surprised to get a Google Hangouts message from a friend while I was setting things up. That reminded me to tweak the settings to vibrate notifications when I am in class.\n\nImportant Details:\n\n1. The power button. You really have to press that sucker for a while before it turns on. After I figured that out, the tablet has worked fine.\n\n2. No \"how-to\" manual. You don't really need one, but I was expecting more than what was included.\n\n3. Make sure you have selected your preferred color choice before buying this product on Amazon. This isn't a huge issue for me. It wasn't until after I had purchased it that I realized I could have chosen black over white. I won't see the back of the tablet when it is in the case, so that wasn't a big deal.\n\n4. Buy your case on Ebay. In fact, buy two! No shipping and handling and their prices are much more reasonable than Amazon. I couldn't believe how much Amazon sellers were asking for cases. I went to Ebay and purchased one slim case with no keyboard and one with a keyboard. I saved a lot of money going the Ebay route. They even had a nice tablet bundle that included some accessories! I am glad I bought a stylus with a rubber tip. It keeps my screen much cleaner.\n\n5. Security. I have set a log in PIN so that my tablet can't be accessed if it is stolen. This is a great feature! I am still trying to figure out if there is a more secure way to access your Google+ account rather than just clicking on the shortcut. This method does not allow me to enter a password which worries me a bit. I need to research this further.\n\nI will update this review once I have spent more time exploring my tablet. So far, I love it!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I can't help wondering if Google tried to figure out what they could get away with by charging an excessive amount for a sub standard product. The price is obviously high, its easy to do a straight comparison with many tablets of a similar specification. The technology is terrible - examples: battery life is awful and the OS seems to have no control over apps that just keep loading themselves unnecessarily draining battery life. You have to hold down the On button for ever and then it takes ages for the system to wake up (compared to a few seconds for the Surface Pro). The automatic display brightness is in a constant state of confusion, switching from blindingly light to a dull grey without any change in the ambient light. Connecting to wifi is often intermittent. It gets very hot. Charging takes forever. Many, many apps just seem to crash (could be a developer issue, but it seems to happen way to regularly). The authorized cover is an expensive joke, the magnets are weak and it slips off too easily and its fiddly to set up to use in portrait mode. I will start to bore you if I go on, but believe me there are many other issues. There are lots of forums with people talking about the same problem, so this isn't just a rogue machine. The good is that it is a perfect size for travelling and its very easy and comfortable to hold.\nI just can't understand how Google allowed this to go out under their name - perhaps it really was just an experiment to see how far they could go?"}

I had to pay to ship it to HTC but luckily they stated they would fix it or send replacement.

Did not have a problem with plastic back or tablet flex. Tablet feels sturdy, but it is too big to fit in your pocket. Clear screen that is easy on Senior eyes.\nCons: HTC charger cord too short(3 ft). Lollipop needs better apps for messaging/texting, a file manager of any kind, and a Gallery replacement for photos (third party substitute Lollipop apps can be found in PlayStore, unless one actually likes Google+ and Hangouts and can figure out how to make them work). Signicant omission, lack of USB port or wireless data transfer app for large photo files or big video/music files. And even with 32GB, still needs expandable microSD slot for storage. Plus real battery life with TED, Netflix, and You Tube seems to be 6 to 7 hours on full charge. And it takes quite a while to charge this tablet. So invest in longer charger cord as I believe one will use the tablet often plugged in."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "This is certainly a good tablet, specially if you live primarily in the Google ecosystem. I think that the version of Lollipop loaded in the Nexus 9 is the best Android experience you can get as of today. I do not like the customisation that other Android-based hardware vendors make of the operating system. As has been written in many places, the Nexus hardware gives you the \"purest\" Android experience. However, the Android Lollipop version is not a fully mature version yet (at least version 5.0.1). Every now and then applications crash, and not only apps from third party vendors, but some of the mainstream Google apps crash frequently in Lollipop, which can be annoying at times. Compared with iOS, it is very noticeable that Apple's ecosystem is much more mature with Apps that behave better in iOS than in Android (I am both an iOS and Android heavy user). Overall the quality of the hardware is good, and is fast and responsive when you interact with the tablet, however, at times it does overheat in the upper part of the tablet which can be a little uncomfortable. I think the Nexus 9 is a great option for consuming content: video (Netflix, YouTube, Google Play, etc.), Web browsing, books, reading documents, email, etc.. If you want to mainly produce content with a tablet, I think that the iPad Air 2 is a better option; it is more expensive, but you will be more productive."}

Its sub par. The back plastic can sometimes feel as if its snapping back into place, even though it was never separated. Creaking is constant but the BIGGEST issue is heat. The battery on this Nexus warms the area near the camera up so much it is uncomfortable to hold. A case quells this issue, but adds too much to heft and thickness for my tastes (mine is a wrap around Poetic case).\nThe buttons are flimsy, and though the plastic and metal seem to be of good quality, it just wasn't put together well.\n\nThe screen is good looking, but I go right back to build quality, because light leak on the edges is way too noticeable. I sent my first Nexus9 back to Amazon because of the bleed on the edges. Otherwise, colors are crisp and very nice. Better Android tablet screen than I've seen thus far.\n\nLollipop is a real winner. This tablet was made for it, and glides through the UI quickly and effortlessly. Just know without SD slot, you need more than base model memory. The clean new interface is simple and intuitive. Family members that  don't usually pick up any tablets of mine but ipad now choose this sometimes.\n\nThere are a ton of reviews on here, but as a self aware google fan, I wish this HTC build was better. I paid 350 for it, now on slickdeals they regularly go refurbed for 250. I mainly wrote this to drop my 2 cents on the build of this tablet."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "What sold me on the Nexus 9?\nFirst, and foremost, early OTA updates with the latest goodies from Google. Nexus devices run a pure Android environment that is far more beautiful, clean, easy, simple than the bloated user interfaces from Samsung, and other Manufacturers desperately trying to \"add value\" to the hardware they manufacture. Performance is usually better, too.\nExcept that it isn't.\nGoogle's Android 5.x flagship isn't living up to the promise because, as of this writing, it is one of the last of the Nexus devices to get the 5.1 update. This tablet was twice as expensive as the Nexus 7, and now N9 owners are already feeling slighted.\n\nNext, the size. The 10\" tablets I've tried were just a bit too heavy to hold for extended periods, and the smaller 7\" tablets were too close to the common 5\" phone screen sizes to justify the tablet. This 9\" size is a great sweet spot.\n\nHaving owned several hTC products in the past, my expectations were high for build quality. The Nexus 9 is beautiful, for sure. From the robust and sleek metal bezel to the smooth, matte and grippy rear panel, this tablet is clearly high end. Until you notice light leaking at the edges of the screen. Or the back panel starts to separate. Some of the early models also had a power and volume button issue, but that seems to be resolved. Overall, the build is still quite nice, though.\n\nThe screen is gorgeous. The pixel density, color reproduction, contrast, all very impressive.\nThe camera is just fine. Not my go-to mobile camera, but I always felt goofy taking pictures with a tablet, anyway.\nI had high hopes for hTC's boom box speakers. Front facing, with plenty of volume, but the sound isn't really great. Dr Dre has left the building, I suppose.\n\nThe Nexus 9 is also on the cutting edge with 64 bit architecture and powerful 2.5GHz Tegra K1 chip. I've owned enough Android and iOS devices to recognize that specs don't necessarily correlate to performance. From the beginning, this tablet impressed me with clean, smooth screen animations. Whether going from app to app, or navigating to the desktop, it looks and feels great.\nFor the first few weeks, anyway.\nEventually, a memory leak issue is causing lag, random reboots, and a launcher refresh issue on top of getting very warm and running down the battery. I've had the tablet replaced, under warranty, and the new one shows no improvement.\nThe aforementioned 5.1 OTA update is slated to resolve some of these issues, but now that nearly every Nexus device but the Android 5 flagship has received it and the N9 has not, this tablet spends more time sitting on my nightstand, awaiting new life.\n\nPerhaps I'll feel differently when the OTA update rolls out. But for now, this is a mediocre 2 star tablet.\n\nUpdate:\nThe Nexus 9 finally received the 5.1.1 update and it has definitely improved things a bit. Memory leaks seem to be fixed, though the homescreen redraws occasionally and Chromecast really bogs things down. I raised this to a moderately nice 4-start tablet, simply because, at this price, the device still falls well short of expectations."}

However, if they get a faulty device, they're quick to leave a bad review.\n\nI've owned this tablet for a few months and I can honestly say I haven't had a single problem.\n\nNo shutdowns or restarts or light bleed or overheating. When the tablet first came out, there were a lot of issues, including the buttons being too flush with the side and some play in the back cover. All of these items were addressed and the newer models don't have these issues.\n\nIf you're buying a refurbished or open box Nexus 9, you may end up getting an older Nexus 9.\n\nThe lack of storage really isn't an issue nowadays. Cloud services are popping up all over. I have around 10,000 songs and close to 600 ebooks uploaded to Google Play as well as several thousand photos which I can access from any of my Android devices as well as my PC. You don't have to have them taking up space on your device. Reading ebooks is great because it'll sync your location in the book and you can continue reading where you left off from any of your other Android devices. I think Google gives you 50gb of cloud storage with your account.\n\nEcosystem is a catch phrase most people use when they refer to Apple and Android. I have a feeling most people have no idea what it means. When people say that the Apple ecosystem is awesome and Android is fragmented, it sometimes makes me want to laugh. My Android phones and tablets work extremely well together. Synchronization is fantastic.\n\nSo, if you're reading these reviews in order to help you make an educated decision as to whether or not buy a Nexus 9, kudos to you. Being an educated consumer is really important nowadays. But keep in mind that the vast majority of Nexus 9 owners have never left a review and may be extremely satisfied with their tablet.\n\nI think the Nexus 9 is great. I don't think it feels cheap.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "This is my first foray into the world of tablets. However, I'm quite satisfied with the Nexus 9. The battery life is pretty good for my use (~1.5 hours per day while using the subway; lasts 3-5 days between charges), the apps and the OS are snappy and responsive. The speakers are loud enough and the screen is pretty good. The tablet itself is also a good weight and is a great size for reading (especially compared to reading the news on my Nexus 4 phone). For reference, the white on the tablet back seems more like a light gray than white, but I purchased a soft, folding case for the tablet, so the back color is rather irrelevant.\n\nSome minor complaints:\n-Small amount of backlight bleed on the edges, but it's barely noticeable, unless I have a letter-boxed video. The screen doesn't have the best anti-glare either.\n-Charging is a bit on the long side, especially if you're trying to charge it via a USB port instead of directly from the wall. But this isn't a big deal either, as I can let it charge overnight or at my desk when I'm at work.\n\nHowever, none of these are enough of a problem to make me regret my purchase or even fret about it.\n\nUpdate (March 1, 2016):\nAfter ~10 months of trouble-free ownership, my tablet died. I applied the February security update from Google and then I started getting random freezes and reboots. I tried a factory reset, but that just made the problem worse. I sent the tablet back to HTC. At first, they wanted $240 for replacing the main board, but after sending in my Amazon invoice as proof of purchase, they waived the fee and repaired it under warranty (I suggest sending this in with your tablet, as they try to establish warranty validity from the serial number if you don't have the proof-of-purchase, which is often months before the purchase date). Upon receiving it back, the tablet works great once more. Overall, the warranty process was pretty painless (a few phone calls, a trip to the post office, and about 2 weeks of time overall)."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "A very solid tablet. I'm going from a 2013 Nexus 7 to this. My tolerance for hitches in animation are a lot higher than what I've seen from tech review sites and places like the Android subreddit so if you're the kind of person that is driven insane by some jerkiness in screen animations, then my user interface experience won't be representative of how yours would be. I will say that the UI has more jerkiness to it compared to the 2013 Nexus 7. This may be fixed in an update but right now the Nexus 7 I have is a smoother experience yet to me the screen jerkiness is pretty much negligible. It isn't anywhere close to being in every animation. To me it's so rare and minor that it doesn't even make me flinch. Now for the real review of which I never use tablet cameras so don't expect any insight for that ever from me.\n\nThis tablet from comparison videos and pictures doesn't look that much bigger than the Nexus 7 but when handling it, it is definitely larger. The weight feels slightly heavier than it but both are very comfortable for me to hold in one hand. The size of the 9 makes moving your hand around more to navigate more prevalent but the added size in an absolute plus to me. The screen is gorgeous. It isn't as eye popping as the Samsung Galaxy Tab S tabs that I've handles but the screen is a marked improvement over the 7. Whites look a lot more whiter and blacks look deeper. My tablet doesn't have any issues with backlight bleed. Reading PDFs/books and comic books is a huge improvement. I don't need to zoom in anymore. Websites are more legible and using the tablet in horizontal posture is now usable. Watching videos, the black bars do not bother me. Videos look great on the screen and the viewing angles are great. At least watching older 4:3 shows now fills the whole screen. Using Word or Excel benefits greatly from the size of the screen and the lower PPI compared to the Nexus 7 hasn't bothered me at all. Pretty much everything about this display is an improvement to me.\n\nIt doesn't feel like the most premium tablet but I keep it in a case so it doesn't matter to me. The main annoyance are the buttons. When I find them, I can push them easy enough but they don't protrude as much as the Nexus 7 so they're harder to locate. Since they're smaller pushing them requires more effort as they're almost so slim and flush with the tablet, it's like they're not buttons at all. That is annoying but I can deal with it. The good thing is that the Nexus 9 has the double tap the screen to wake so at least I don't have to use the power button. At least it doesn't look as bad the older Nexus 9s. The tablet has those HTC Boomsound speakers. They're a definite improvement over what I usually hear from tablet and phone speakers but they're still tablet speakers. They're very clear and louder than the average but nothing to be incredibly impressed with. I always use headphones. Big negative though would be the lack of a microSD card slot. I've learned to live with USB OTG cables and PLEX since Android tablets have sparse options, but I would definitely prefer microSD slot. This will probably be a tank of a tablet so I won't be buying a new one for years but the next one I buy will definitely need a microSD slot. In particular since SOCs have now reached a speed that I won't care how powerful future tablets will be in a couple of years, they'll all be incredibly fast for a device with limited multitasking functionality.\n\nThe tablet uses a Tegra K1 with their 64bit Denver based cores. It rips through games that I play of which are pretty much just old PS1 JRPG games that have been released on Google Play so nothing too hardware intensive. It smashes word search and tetris as well. My main reason to upgrade was because the screen size and aspect ratio of the Nexus 7 made reading a chore, but the other reason was video playback of higher quality videos on it were choppy. The playback would be fine with my Snapdragon 801 equipped Sony Xperia Z2 but the Nexus 7 would play them choppy. I've tested with the Nexus 9 some really high quality h. 264 videos on it. They're 4k 75,000 kbps bit-rate videos and the Nexus 9 has no problems playing them. The Snapdragon 801 plays them just as well but the Nexus 7 can't keep up. The strength of the tablet is pretty awesome to me. Even though there are small animation jitters here and there, the navigation experience to me is beyond satisfactory for me.\n\nAn overall solid tablet experience is what I'd say about this. It has a great screen with great size. The weight is light. It's great for reading and watching videos. To me the experience isn't any worse than an iPad or Samsung tablet. I wish the volume and power buttons were larger as well as the tablet having a microSD slot. Also getting rid of all jerky animations would be preferable. Those make this tablet imperfect but I can get over any of that. If not this tablet I would recommend the Galaxy Tab S8.4 since 7 inches is just too small for optimal reading and it's just barely a good enough size for videos. 10 inch tablets that are 16:9 are too long to be that comfortable to use. 4:3 and 3:2 tablets are more solid in its usability in both screen orientations. Even the full size iPad is too big for me yet the iPad mini is too small to me. 8.9\" tablet with a 4:3 screen ratio is good sweet spot to me. This tablet is awesome. It's a much better companion to a desktop than a laptop is to me now. I would recommend this tablet if people asked me."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "***Update 7/21/15***\nHave had 5.1.1 for a while now.  I can say things are a little smoother than they were.  Tablet still takes a long time to boot up.  I think that is because it is loading all of the apps you had in the background running.  I have noticed if I have a game that is a resource hog in the background running, it will cause issues.  I don't think that has anything to do with the tablet and more to do with the game (Godus for anyone interested).  Still love this tablet and still use it daily.  Feel free to ask me any questions and I will be glad to answer them the best I can.\n\n***Update 5/12/15***\nReceived Android 5.0.2 a week or so ago.  Tablet is running much better and it seems to be getting better battery life.  I am not going to adjust my rating but want to add on to my review:\n\nI still love this tablet.  It is a great upgrade from my Xoom.  After playing with it more and more, I have found a few things that I don't like, but can live with.\n\nIf you have a lot of things running in the background, it can become very slow or even unresponsive.  No biggie and is to be somewhat expected, but the OS should found a better way to handle the resources not currently being used.\n\nI was having random resets when loading games or certain apps.  The whole tablet would freeze then seconds/mins later, reset.  Not often, like once every other week or so.  I haven't had that issue since 5.0.2 but that doesn't mean it won't happen again.\n\nIt takes a long time for this to start up.  I don't know if this has been fixed because as I said, since 5.0.2, it hasn't reset on me.  I tend to restart my phone/tablets every so often to clear out any junk, but forget to sometimes.  Will update after I do it next time.\n\nThat being said, version 5.1.1 is rolling out now for this tablet.  Will update again once I receive the update and have had time to play with it.  This bring the Nexus 9 to the current version of Android which I am VERY happy about!\n\n***Original Review***\n\nI am all about the Nexus line.  Love the phones and Love the tablets.\n\nWith that being said, I did return the first one because it stopped charging.  I factory reset it and still wouldn't work.  Amazon gladly replaced it with not issue.\n\nThe missing star in this case is the support.  It comes with Lollipop but there have been several updated versions this tablet has yet to receive.  Not a big deal but buying a Nexus, you expect more timely pushes.\n\nI use this mostly for gaming and surfing the web.  Nothing that really tests it.  It feels very light compared to other tables I have felt.  If you are buying this for gaming, make sure you get one with enough storage.  With no SD support, you want to make sure you have enough room to fit as many games as possible.  I made that mistake with my last phone and won't do it again.\n\nThis is an upgrade from my Xoom.  The battery life isn't as great as the Xoom, but I easily get a days worth out of it if I am gaming heavily on it.  Otherwise it normally lasts 2-4 days of normal surfing.  This is with the screen dim and nothing running in the background.  Usage will vary user to user.\n\nDon't hesitate to buy a case with this thing.  It is very expensive and you don't want something like a scratch on your new toy bringing you down.  There are lots to choose from that are inexpensive, but still get the job done.  I went with a fake leather one and love it."}

Same issues reported by many, just worse.\nThe size seemed perfect. Screen bleed was acceptable, only visible in a couple of spots. The rest is similar to what others reported with the sluggish touch response and very very slow performance. Sometimes it took a several seconds to open an app or switch between. It was as slow as my 2+ year old kindle fire.  When I compared it to wife's galaxy tab S it is hard to believe this Google's flagship. And then the killer.... Every few minutes, without any rhyme or reason, it would reboot. Did this for hours. I first thought it was installing updates or something like that, but never stopped doing it.

With no removable memory, you would think Google would at least enable using a thumb drive or card reader via a USB OTG (on the go) adapter cable...  But nope.  3rd party apps (ES File Explorer) can read NTFS and FAT32 formatted drives/cards, but not exFAT.\n- The screen is a fingerprint magnet (think 4+ year old cell phone technology), and the size makes it difficult to clean using your shirt.\n- Intermittent hangs and instability really put a damper on the user experience (with the latest version of 5.0 before the 5.1 update)\n\nI really wanted to like this tablet, as something I could use as an ultralight convertible with the keyboard folio for actually being productive with, but the forced Nexus philosophy of local storage or cloud only really limits the devices possibilities, and the intermittent stability makes one lose any faith that the device will work when you need it in a meeting/conference.  The keyboard folio was nice to type on, but could use more adjustability and dedicated function keys (rather than unprinted shortcuts), and is a bit overpriced.\n\nFor $350+, I just didn't feel the tablet had any significant advantages/features that justified the price point.  From someone that has had a Nexus 7, Nexus 7 FHD, Nvidia Tegra Note 7 and Nvidia Shield tablets (as well as various android phones (Evo's/N4/S3/M7/G3)), I can't see how this tablet is worth more than ~$250, and that is being generous (only due to the nice screen size and aspect ratio)."}

I purchased this tablet from best buy because I was bored with Apple and wanted to check out lollipop and the nexus 9. I get the tablet and the first thing that annoyed me was the weight. Compared to the iPad Air 2 this thing is heavy. Secondly, holding it verticle for a long period of time cuts into my hands.  Next, I power on the device and have to be on wifi just to get pass the introduction screen to android for the tablet to move to the home screen where the apps are. So after that I play around with lollipop and have to admit, I like the material design and gestures. My biggest gripe is that I like to type papers  on the virtual keyboard (soft key). I tried every keyboard with word predictions and all of them failed i.e. swift key,Google keyboard,go , flesky, ai keyboard . Apps kept crashing like no tomorrow ie double twist, YouTube, soundcloud, etc. I can't deal with that. Battery life is suppose to be all day and that sucked. Nowhere near and I had the brightness to a low level. Speakers are suppose to be boom sound, but the speakers were ok not the best, I liked them. Tried to use different ebook readers and it takes 2 seconds for the page to turn. Also, I got some hiccups from the tablet delaying. I bought a 16gb version,but no sd card and the highest is 32gb for this tablet is weak. My iPad Air 2 is 64gb with room to spare. As much as I wanted to like this tablet, It is and was a horrible experience. Maybe it's the nexus tablet and not android overall but it's not for me. It really makes me appreciate the little things that Apple pays attention to. Palm rejection, app Eco system, speed, compatibility camera, it all just works.

I called Google who referred me to HTC. HTC went through multiple trouble shooting calls with me, told me that they would have their \"Tiger or Escalation Team\" call me back within 72 hours. It took two days to call me back, and all they wanted to do is have me return it. Now the real crappy part of this this whole situation, HTC made me pay $35 to have their faulty device sent to them for repairs. So now I am out another $35 on this device. HTC and Google in this case really need to pull their heads out of their a***** and get this figured out, I should not have to spend any extra money to fix a device a just purchased."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "[02/26/2015 Rewrite of the review]\n\nPros:\n- No bloatware. No junk apps that are usually included with other Android Smartphone/Tablets.\n- Apps were snappy and fast.\n- Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus, Xfinity, and Youtube all ran perfectly\n\nCons:\n- Very minor issue but you have to install a third party app for On-the-Go storage so you can access or transfer files to a USB thumb drive using a OTG cable.\n- No exFat support. You have to root the tablet and install a third party app to activate it. Without rooting, basically thumbdrives and memory cards have to be formatted to NTFS or Fat32 for it to be read. Sucks for me since most of my thumbdrives and Sdcards are formatted exFat since it is able to be read by both Mac and PC without the file size cap limit of Fat32.\n- No USB 3.0. So slower transfers speeds between your computer or OTG device.\n- No Miracast support. This is a feature that allows new Android or Windows 8.1 devices to wirelessly mirror your screen to a monitor using a Miracast compatible adapter. I use the Microsoft Wireless Display adapter with my Samsung S5 and MS Surface Pro (1st gen) to stream netflix to my TV. Not a great technology (stutters on certain content) but it is a nice feature that was disappointing to find that it is not on the device.\n- No MHL support. I couldn't test this since I don't have this adapter. Basically it is a micro-USB to HDMI adapter that allows you to play videos from the Android phone/tablet to a screen. Like miracast but wired and better.\n- No micro-sd card slot. I knew this going in, but it is just disappointing none the less. The ability for extra storage would have been nice.\n\nConclusions:\nI purchased this device and returned it after one day. As you can see by the cons list, I was blown away what Google (or HTC) decided to leave off of their flagship Android tablet. If you are just looking for a device to stream video and read the news. Definitely get this. But for someone like me who was looking for bells and whistles, this device is a major disappointment. Two stars from me.\n\nThanks Amazon for your great customer service!\n\n[Old Review]\nI was looking for a media consumption device that was fast with a solid battery life. I decided to go with an Android OS over the Apple iOS due to my familiarity with Android smart phones and OTG USB storage (Apple not having any). I do have a Microsoft Surface Pro (first gen), which I love, that I was using as a tablet but battery life was now horrendous and, considering the cost of the device, not smart to use around the various exercise machines at the gym. It was a great portable all around laptop but wasn't that great as a simple tablet.\n\nI decided to snap the Google Nexus 9 32GB. It fulfilled the role of being fast. According to the benchmark tests I looked up, it ranked at the top three. Battery life was good at 8+ hours. Another benefit was that it wasn't loaded with junk software that the other Android tablets were. What I was afraid of was that it didn't have a USB 3.0 connection (for fast charging, compatibility with my USB 3.0 OTG cable, and speedy transfer speeds) and no micro SD card slot.\n\nI should have listened to my fears. Because on top of the immediate minuses that I knew going in, there were others that I discovered in my one day of use. You needed to install a third party software to access OTG capability. My Samsung S5 was compatible out of the box. To go along with the OTG issues, usb thumbdrives and other devices connected through the OTG cable needs to be formated as Fat32 or NTFS. Silly since most USB thumbdrives and SD cards are default formatted to exFat. You could root the device to make it compatible with exFat but I didn't want to do that right away. Once I formatted one of my Thumb drives to NTFS, placed a HD videos on it, and installed various video players on the Nexus 9; I tried playing videos over the OTG cable. Unlike my Samsung S5 where it mostly played videos with some stuttering, it stuttered all the videos endlessly or failed to play the video at all on the Nexus 9. Another fault that I was surprised to find was that it didn't support miracast. Miracast is supported by most of the latest Android OS and Windows OS 8.1 devices. My Samsung S5 and Microsoft Surface Pro support it. I don't use it much but it definitely is a neat feature that allows me to stream wirelessly to my TV using my Microsoft Wireless Video Adapter.\n\nBut there are some plus. It did work well with Netflix, Comcast Xfinity, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. Like my Surface Pro, the fact it didn't have any bloatware was very refreshing. Apps seemed snappy. It was just that the minuses were just hard to ignore. I sent it back after only one day. Thanks Amazon for your great customer service!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "The tablet is nice. I purchased the black 32GB version. It arrived in pristine shape and well packaged in a retail type package. It is a white rigid plastic that could be used for future storage but NOT for returning the tablet should it need repair (see below).\n\n* The screen is very bright and has a beautiful color range.\n* The WiFi reception is great. I used this in the hospital (main reason I bought it), my phone got a mediocre signal, but the Nexus 9 got great reception. I was able to stream Netflix at 720p and higher with no problems at all.\n*The battery life is fairly good too. I use the tablet a lot for playing music locally and reading PDFs. I had used it for a long time before noticing my battery was quite low and I had to plug it in.\n\n* Some of the features took me a little luck, guessing, reading the help, Googleing, and trial and error.\n* Battery recharge time could be better, but it isn't too awful.\n* I pre-purchased the Nexus 9 because it was touted as becoming the new flagship, but post release reviews have proven otherwise. Word to the wise: wait until release and wait for the reviews before dropping some serious cash.\n\nThe real bad:\n\n* After about a month of light use, a dead spot appeared on the screen. the display in that are was fine, but an area the size of a dime became unable to detect a tap. I contacted HTC and they were very helpful, walking me though many different fix attempts before authorizing a return for \"repairs\", not a \"replacement\". You have to find your own bow that can safely return the tablet in.\n\n* You will have paid full price for a new tablet, but end up with a repaired tablet at no fault of your own.\n\n* Shipping and insurance cost are your responsibility (rather expensive) as well as repair costs if they are not under the limited warranty. Hope yours does not have a defect of you will pay more for a used tablet in the end."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I've been a longtime fan of Google's Nexus line of phones and tablets and have owned nearly every one they've released, so I happily paid the high sticker price for the Nexus 9. After a week, I'm sending it back.\n\nIt's no secret that Google allowed HTC to release a shoddy product. A few searches will turn up a bevvy of gripes from buyers and professional tech reviewers alike. I'm here to say that they are all valid in their statements.\n\nThe first thing I noticed after turning on the device is the light bleed from LEDs around the bezel. My unit was not as bad as many early buyers', but it's still very noticeable when viewing anything with a dark background. However, I was willing to look past this. I also managed to escape the \"gummy\" power/volume buttons. Although they weren't recessed into the device or difficult to press, as many people have encountered, the buttons were still far less clicky and didn't provide much feedback when pressed. Still, it wasn't so bad as to necessitate returning the device.\n\nThe real problems have emerged over the last week of use. First off, the device gets searingly hot when performing the most basic of functions. While browsing the web, the top center of the device gets uncomfortably hot. So much, in fact, that the back panel is now beginning to warp and bow. I was able to press into a \"bubble\" surrounding the area of the processor and heard an audible pop as the plastic jumped back into place. After further inspection, I noticed bowing in other areas of the back panel, however it wasn't giving the \"trampoline effect\" some people experienced at the center of the Nexus logo, but it is definitely noticeable.\n\nCharging is also a tedious process. The battery in the Nexus 9 is fairly large, but the fact that an hour of charge time will often net a mere 10% increase in battery is absurd. The least HTC could have done was include quick charge technology, but as that can generate a lot of heat I can only imagine that it would cause further warping of the back panel.\n\nEssentially, this is a colossal waste of money. HTC, a company known for making high-quality products, released one of the worst tablets I have ever had the misfortune of using. The entire device seems half-assed, as if they were rushing to get a product out the door and didn't bother to do ANY quality control. Google shares plenty of blame here as well for allowing their device partner to let what feels like a discount store tablet get into the hands of consumers with the Nexus branding emblazoned on it.\n\nUnless HTC and Google are willing to completely rebuild this product from the ground-up and do right by those who are already stuck with this pathetic piece of hardware, buyers should in no way look to the Nexus 9 as a viable option. Personally, I think both companies should be willing to replace the tablets with updated hardware at their expense. Until then, this is going back to Amazon.\n\nIn other words: DO NOT BUY."}

I purchased the tablet in November 2014 and as of March 2015, the unit is completely dead, won't power on. It has less than 10 hours use on it, never been out of my home, never been dropped or anything that would cause issue. Amazon won't stand behind their product, Google won't stand behind their product so I'm out $350 on an overpriced paperweight.\n\nPrevious Review ----------------\nI guess I got lucky as my Nexus 9 doesn't have the backlight bleed or squishy back problems other people have written about but I'm just not overwhelmed by this tablet even though I love my other HTC devices. Overall this is a pretty good tablet but I'm not sure I like the 16:9 aspect ratio as it makes a lot of my favorite games and apps look awful. As an android developer, I bought this primarly for the Lolliop OS and the fact Nexus devices always get the most current OS first. After my last tablet (Acer Iconia) manufacturer abandoned updates, and the fact my phone (HTC One) gets delayed updates, having a Nexus device has become necessary. From a consumer standpoint, I probably wouldn't purchase this tablet or recommend it, mainly because it doesn't have external storage but for a developer tablet, the Nexus is blazing fast and increases my workflow."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I waited most of the 2014 year, through all of the \"hype\" about a new Nexus tablet before I finally decided to make my purchase.  Moving up from my first tablet (NOOK HD), this tablet has met and exceeded my expectations.  With so many reviews on tablets from so many different people, it can be quite confusing to make your final selection.  In the end, I focused on \"my needs in a tablet\" vs all of the wonderful things a tablet, reader or small pc could do for the consumer.  My NOOK HD was great as a reader and served my needs for that and very basic internet surfing.  Over time, net surfing became more critical for my needs and the NOOK could not handle that task.  Moving from a 7\" to 9\" has given me the perfect compromise from too small for internet surfing to more than acceptable for gathering information from the internet without constantly squeezing the screen.  I purchased a MoKo slim fit cover from Amazon and couldn't be happier with the quality on both items.  Color and clarity of the screen is excellent and I like the touch screen feel.  Going with the Nexus also gave me the latest in Android systems which was important to me since I don't trade my tech toys in every year as some people may do. The tablet has plenty of power for my needs.  The only concern I have is that it didn't come with a manual and searching online to better understand how to use the tablet has been a slow process for me.  In the end, my advice is to focus on your needs then find the best tablet for the price you are willing to pay.  It's easy to be swayed by all of the bells and whistles that today's tech tools have, but how many apps do you really use should help you decide what the best tablet is to meet your needs.  The bottom line for me was...this tablet was well worth the year long wait."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I'm a big Nexus fan. I've owned the Nexus 4 and currently own the Nexus 5. They were all great no nonsense devices with stock Android OS. This means zero bloat. The Nexus 9 benefits much from this as well, but the hardware issues with it hold it back from me giving a real recommendation.\n\nFirst and foremost is the backlight bleeding on the screen which will vary from unit to unit. Backlight bleeding is when there are bright spots appearing near the edges of the screen. It is most noticeable on a black or dark background at high brightness settings. Be aware that ALL LCD screens have some level of backlight bleeding. The difference is that the Nexus 9's backlight bleed is very inconsistent/non-uniform which gives a spotty look along the edges. I purchased this unit twice from Amazon and once from Best Buy and they all had unnaceptable levels of this issue. Granted 95%, you won't even notice it, but when you watching anything that has black bars on top and bottom, it really shows.\n\nSecondly, the back is a little squishy, where you can push the back in. There is a small amount of space between the back cover and the battery that causes this. Again, the amount of this varies from unit to unit, and it's not something you'd notice when holding the tablet normally. I don't consider it a real issue as its only something that you'd really have to purposely look for.\n\nThird, is the buttons which barely stick out which can make it a little difficult to press. One of the units I bought had the buttons completely flush to the frame which was horrible. The other units, were acceptable, but still pretty shallow. Fortunately, with the Nexus 9, you can just double-tap the screen to turn the screen back on without having to touch the power button. Still, there are the volume buttons that you'd still have to deal with on regular occasion.\n\nThat's pretty much it in terms of what I consider to be \"faults\", though there are other little non-deal breaker quibbles with this unit. It does tend to get kinda hot on the upper half when you're doing anything heavy like games and I have noticed a few times where the home screen kinda flashes and resets itself (takes a second or two) when you switch back and for between apps and homescreen. The latter issue, i attribute to the Lollipop OS because I noticed this issue too when i upgraded my Nexus 5 to Lollipop.\n\nNow that's out of the way, let me point out some good things about the device. The battery life is decent and performance is great when inside apps or on the homescreen. Everything is very smooth; a little bit faster and smoother than my Nexus 5. Many people complain about the 4:3 aspect ratio but i rather enjoy the size. It is a superior size for web browsing and reading; just not as good for viewing widescreen video since there will be black bars showing. Fortunately, i do a ton more of the former than the latter, so this benefits me fine. For reading, i like view comics with this tablet using Comicrack. It's near perfect for this. In portrait mode, you can view a full comic book page with the only wasted space being a 1/4\" black bar on the left and on the right.  I think the 3:2 aspect ratio, like seen on the Windows Surface Pro 3, would be the most ideal for comics. Also, for anyone coming over from an iPad, it is a much easier transition. Lollipop is quite lovely although not quite optimized for tablets yet. The notification pull-down barely takes up half of the width screen, so there is a lot of wasted space that could've been used. On my Nexus 5, the notification menu takes up 95% percent of the width of the screen which is more appropriate."}

We finally have an Android tablet with a 4:3 aspect ratio (iPads have had this since day one), which makes using this tablet in portrait mode feel much more natural.  This is the first Nexus tablet with a bidirectional audio jack, which means it will work with portable credit card readers such as those from Square, PayPal, and Intuit. The Nexus 9 is very fast thanks to it's 64-bit processor, and comes with the stock version of Android 5 (aka Lollipop), uncluttered by OEM or ISP bloatware.  The IPS screen is beautiful and easy to read, even from wide angles.  The dual front-facing speakers sound great, and are a nice change from the rear speakers on most other tablets."}

It has a screaming fast processor, gorgeous display, and Android just FEELS right on this device. If I were buying a tablet and ALL I was going to use it for was as a tablet, this would probably be the one I would buy. I really admire the device. But I want a tablet I can also use as a productivity tool, and this is where I feel the Nexux 9, or it's accessory keyboard in particular, to be lacking. When I type on the Nexus 9 keyboard, it's kinda floppy and just generally not very stable. The keyboard I got for the iPad, by comparison, feels almost like, and in some ways nicer, than typing on a \"real\" keyboard. The whole thing just has a better feel to it. So I wouldn't recommend the Nexus 9 if you're looking for an add-on, portable productivity-enhancing tool. But if you're looking for a really, really, really nice tablet, this is a beautiful solution. Nice work on the tablet, accessories need some help."}

When even the slightest torsion is applied, backlight bleed becames worse. In a word, the concept is nice, execution from HTC is really bad. I will wait for a Nexus 9 2015, in the meantime the nvidia shield will do!"}

My unit came in without any of the problems so many have complained about. No light bleeding, the power and volume buttons are nice and clicky, no excessive heat, no flexy back panel, Lollipop isn't laggy at all (on the contrary, its the fasted OS I've used!) and the speakers sound amazing. If you're on the fence I'd suggest you just go ahead and order it. Amazon has a great return policy and great customer service so worst case you can just return it if you get a crappy device. I'm happy with my purchase."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Pros:\n-Its a Nexus device!\n- Snappy performance (or not? see below)\n- 4:3 aspect ratio (or not, if you like movies)\n- Nice viewing angles and screen is nicely calibrated\n- Front facing speakers\n- 8.9 in screen is portable\n- Camera has flash\n\nCons\n- Design could be better\n- Poor button design and placement\n- Slow to charge\n- Micro USB cord is short.\n- Poor rear camera. No HDR and noisy pics\n-Some apps are not optimized for the 4:3 aspect ratio, android 5.0\n- $399/$479 prices might not be justifiable\n\nFirst off, I'm a student who uses the Nexus 9 for basic web browsing and ebook reading. I carry my Nexus 9 while I'm commuting on the subway, or when my macbook is too heavy to carry. Secondly, I snagged mine off Amazon Warehouse deals. The serial # is HT4AH (October build), so its likely you'll receive a newer model.\n\nDesign and Feel:\nWhen I first unboxed the Nexus 9 I was surprised how light it was (compared to my Asus tf201). The Nexus 9 fits in your hand nicely for one handed use. Its not too big nor too small. The device, however, doesn't feel as premium or well designed as others. The edges run straight down, making the device look thicker than it is. The back is a soft plastic. It feels nice. My unit doesn't have back issues. It does flex slightly, but not as much as others suggest (see gizmodo review), its nowhere near that. Maybe 1mm. Around the tablet is a metal band. The band isn't exactly well built by any chance, I was able to get a hairline scratch from daily use.\nOverall: 7/10\n\nHardware & Performance:\nI know this is a cliche, but this tablet is speedy. Switching between apps is a breeze, pdfs load quickly, games load quickly. There are some issues with apps. Ex. Youtube app, the app hangs for a sec until it opens. However, this is most likely a software issue thats going to be fixed. The only thing I wish the Nexus 9 had was 3gb of RAM. Chrome does browser refreshed when too many tabs are open.\nOverall: 8.5/10\n\nBattery:\nI typically get 5-7.5 hours of screen on time with the Nexus 9. My daily routine involves reading PDFs, listening to music, Youtube streaming, web browsing. I'm not impressed honestly. Both my Asus TF201 and iPad mini could pull out more. Secondly, the tablet is slow to charge. I haven't timed it, but it takes 3-4 hours for 0 to full.  Lastly, the charging cable that comes with the tablet is short by my standards (3 feet). The micro usb tip is also symmetrical. Meaning when you try to plug it into your tablet, you're going to be flipping it up and down trying to figure which side goes in. Yea, definitely not intuitive as Apple's lightning cable.\nOverall: 6.5/10\n\nCamera:\nYes, I know some people hate tablet photography but here goes. The Nexus 9's camera is mediocre. Its noisy and is easily confused in fluorescent lighting. On the plus side, it does have flash (flashlight!) and video focus is decent. Pretty much the only thing this thing is good for is taking pics of barcodes and text.\nOverall: 7/10\n\nSoftware:\nAndroid 5.0 is refined, albeit buggy. Most of the bugs come from 3rd party apps that haven't optimized for 5.0 (see Nvidia games). If you're switching over from iOS, you're may be disappointed. My favorite apps on iOS (Lightroom and Spanishdict) are unoptimized for the tablet. Most of the basic apps are here, but I still feel iOS still has some of the niches people may enjoy.\nOverall: 8/10\n\nFInal Thoughts\nOverall, the Nexus 9 is a good tablet, its not excellent or outstanding, its good. But for the price of $399/479, I would not consider it. $349/$429? Maybe. $300 is more of a reasonable price to pay for this type of hardware. For one, HTC doesnt feel refined as Apple or Samsung in the tablet business. This is there first tablet in a while, and I feel like there R&D team hasn't caught up to the other players. If you have no preference for OSs, I would actually recommend the iPad Mini 2 ($299). Its lighter, thinner, more portable, and cheaper. I have one and a majority of the students at my school use one and love it. Another device I should mention is the Samsung Tab S. I do not own one, but I suppose the 16:10 aspect ratio should be better for movie watchers.\n\nWho Should Buy the Nexus 9?\nAndroid Fans\n-People who prefer the 4;3 aspect ratio\n-People who don't mind a mundane design\n\n(Pic attached of light bleed)"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Don't pay $399, buy it at the lower price of $349\n\nFinally, Google has given us a great form factor for a Nexus tablet. The operating system has been refined to reflect Google's new philosophy of \"material design.\" New adopters of this tablet who are used to the old versions of the OS may find that there is a bit of a learning curve in Android 5.0 \"Lollipop\" than in previous versions of the operating system. Holo Blue is gone and done away with and now we have something that appears to be brighter with less blacks and darks on app drawers and system screens. I found that the boot up time takes about 20 seconds from the time you power it on (Not sure if that is a point that anyone cares about but I figured I put it in my review for those interested).\n\nI tend to find that my experiences on the Nexus 10 and the Nexus 7 running Android 4.4.4 was a better user experience. Not that there is anything wrong with the Nexus 9 user experience. It just may take awhile for people like myself who are new to the Android 5.0 to get used to its new design and layout. I did find that the OS has no lag or slow down effect when put through its paces. Its snappier when moving from app to app and I find that my videos and movies tend to download faster than on the previously mentioned devices.\n\nThe device also comes with two front facing speakers on the top and the bottom of the device, a welcome addition to smartphones and tablets as of late. When tilted to landscape mode, the sound coming from the speakers will give you a true stereo experience like the Nexus 10. I hope that front facing speakers for Nexus devices are here to stay, but I guess we will have to wait and see.\n\nNow there is a metal edge all around the tablet but the back is just the usual soft plastic that previous Nexus devices have. I feel that the bezels on the top and the bottom of the device should have been smaller but I guess they did it that way to accommodate the speakers. I have would given the Nexus 9 a higher rating but the OS does not take advantage of all the screen the Nexus 9 has to offer. Hopefully this will be addressed in future OS updates, but again we will all have to wait and see. Also, there is no notification LED as the OS is supposed to give you updates on the screen as they come in.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this device is the price. Google Play store is selling the device for $399. The device does not have a higher resolution camera like the one you see on the Nexus 6. The Nexus 9 does not have a 4K or a QHD display. Also, it is not made of premium materials, like you would see on an all metal body device like an iPad. In my opinion there is no justification for the price being $399. That's why I bought it from here on Amazon for $349.\n\nOf more important note, if you are going to purchase this device, DO NOT pay more than the $349 price that is being offered here at Amazon. Based on my experience with the device, I feel this device is not worth the $399 that Google is trying to sell this device for. I suppose you could save your money and put it towards a Nexus 6. However, if you really want to have a premium Nexus experience, on a tablet of this size, make sure you save yourself some money and buy it at the lower price point.\n\nAgain, don't pay $399, buy it at the lower price of $349."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Build quality is such a disappointment. The buttons on the sides are not tactile at all and they feel horrible when clicking. A major problem is light bleeding from the screen which is an annoyance specially as I use my tablet to watch movies and this ruins the movie experience. Another major problem is that the screen is not straight and has a small bend, this is obvious as when feeling the screen from one edge, it is flush and from the other edge it is slighty below the metal frame. I have experienced this issue with my previous HTC M4 and my HTC M7. The software however is great but stutters a lot, and that should be improved by further updates. The good features however are all software related, and they would have been further improved if the tablet had 3GBs of RAM rather than 2. In comparison to my iPad Mini which I have previously owned, it has a slightly better feel and the boom sound speakers are the best on any tablet out. The iPad however has a  far better build quality and the battery life is a lot better.  Overall I am disspaonted with the Nexus 9 and I would really like a replacement unit because if these build issues were to be fixed, it would be perfect. PS I have recently discovered the LED light on the bottom, will that be a notification light or?"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Horrible, horrible quality control. I had to suffer through multiple replacements before giving up. Horrendous screen bleed. Stuck pixels. Buttons flush to the tablet and difficult to press. Trampoline back not properly attached. Screen flickering. Every one had at least 2 of these issues. I can't recommend this tablet for anyone considering these problems.\n\nEDIT April 2015:\n\nIf you happen to get a Nexus 9 that was manufactured in mid-to-late December 2014 or later, you will love this tablet. Serial numbers - HTC4C = December, the letter after C corresponds to the day of the month. HTC51 would be January '15. FYI the Sand (tan-colored) Nexus 9 wasn't released until long after the white and black models, so they only consist of mid-Dec '14 models and on. However, Sand is only available directly from Google and only comes in 32GB. Additionally, it goes for full retail and isn't discounted like on Amazon.\n\nThe displays on the dec '14 models have essentially zero light bleed. The display is gorgeous and superbly accurate. The iPad Air 2 display definitely pops a bit more, but it can't match the Nexus 9 in it's accurate presentation. There are some small defects in the display for the most obsessive tech pedants, although not any more than any other device, iPads included. Every Dec '14 Nexus 9 display (I've seen about a half dozen) has a slight book spine shadow on the right middle, a slightly warm/yellow top left corner, a slightly brighter bottom left corner, a slightly darker top right corner. AND I MEAN SLIGHT AS IN BARELY EVEN A THING. Honestly, most people can't and won't notice these things, ever. I'm super obsessive and perceptive with these things, and even I will admit it's not really an issue. I've seen many tablet/TV/laptop displays, including the iPad Air 1/2, that have the same or worse problems. Honestly, these are just problems with ALL high resolution LED-lit LCD displays. If I had to pick one of these issues that is most noticeable, it would be the slightly warm/yellow tint in the top left corner, but really it's not too big of a deal. Keep in mind that the degree of each of these problems varied device-to-device, but they all had it in some fashion.\n\nIt really is a great device when it doesn't have any hardware defects. It's fast, very fast. There are some hiccups with the brand new Android 5.0 Lollipop software (which is otherwise amazing and the best mobile OS in the world), but I don't blame the device hardware too much (See anandtech's amazing hardware review). Android 5.1.1 will be coming soon to address these issues. The graphics processing unit is unmatched, even by the powerful iPad Air 2. The only better mobile GPU is found in Nvidia's yet-to-be-released X1 processor.\n\nThe plastic back is fantastic. The backplates of Nexus 9's manufactured from mid-dec '14 are now glued down in the center, preventing the loose, bouncy, and at-times creaky trampoline backplate early model Nexus 9's suffered from. The plastic back has a soft, matte finish that feels great and velvety to the touch. Some may lament the lack of a full aluminum unibody. Aluminum unibody definitely feels more premium and solid in the hand. However, in my opinion, the soft matte finish is more comfortable and more pleasant to hold. It's feels warm and inviting as opposed to cold and harsh aluminum. One thing to note is that the plastic on the Black edition is a finger print magnet. I'd stick with the Sand or White colors instead.\n\nThe buttons are okay. As I've said I've seen a half-dozen Dec '14 models, and all of the buttons are relatively flush with the side of the tablet, but stick out enough to be tactile. They are all clicky and decently responsive. This is a slight improvement from earlier models. Only one of the Dec '14 models had buttons that didn't click until the buttons were slightly inside the frame (common with the early Nexus 9s), making the use of these buttons a horrible experience.\n\nThe back of the tablet near the camera can get a little warm. Especially if you are charging up the battery while playing graphically-intense 3d games for a moderate period of time. Otherwise it's not too bad at all. With general use, browsing, or video watching it doesn't heat up much at all.\n\nMy recommendation - buy new, if the serial number is HTC4C*** or HTC5**** you'll probably have no issues. If you don't want to role the dice, and money's no option, definitely go for the 32GB Sand edition. Otherwise go with the White 16Gb or 32Gb unless you really, really like black and aren't bothered by fingerprints on the back. You'll most likely get a newer model without any problems."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I've had both the Nexus 9 and Nvidia Shield Tablet (Nexus 9 being 400+) with Shield being 300.\n\nNow the Nexus 9 is good for what it is, but it is all the good that the Shield has.  So unless you are willing to put down an extra 100 dollars for 4x3 it is not worth it.  Also the HTC made \"Magic Cover\" is a complete scam, and waste of money.  So to get a proper working cover you would have to spit out another 100 for Keyboard Folio.\n\nNow onto the actual device critique.  The battery life on the Nexus 9 is mediocre at best.  I found myself often needing to plug it in half way into the day just from it being on idle draining battery.  The tablet also when doing anything other than idle heats up on the back severely and quickly (Along with the battery draining at a expedited rate.)  The 64bit processor that is the selling point of this tablet gives no real advantage due to almost zero apps making use of it.  The tablet also suffered lag when doing even light multi tasking, something a premium priced tablet with a 64bit processor should be able to handle.\n\nSupport for the device from the manufacturer HTC was pathetic.  With the customer service I spoke to having no understanding of the tablet beyond what I could easily read off the store page.\n\nOverall, this is really a tablet for nobody.  If you are wanting a 4x3 premium priced tablet you probably should be in the market for looking at the IPad or if you are looking for a tablet with a good processor + andriod look into the Nvidia Shield.  As this tablet falls far too short to be worth looking into getting."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I started out wanting to give this tablet 5 stars but after owning it for a month, it sadly doesn't deserve it.  I've got a few problems with it.  One, the light bleed emanating from the corners is real and difficult to ignore on a pitch black screen.  However, I never look at pitch black screens, so in reality the problem is minor.  Also, it's possible I have a revised, newer edition of the Nexus 9 that addressed early manufacturing defects like heavy light bleed, case separation, and low quality power/volume buttons (the casing and buttons on mine are fine).  Two, the screen flickers when viewing mostly white screens, such as those found in most websites.  This wasn't noticeable at first, but recently I witnessed it ever so gently and rapidly flickering from time to time.  If it were consistent, more intense, or more common I'd try for a repair or refund but this is like a once or twice a day kinda thing that can be overlooked.  Three, the sound on this is rather disappointing compared to my HTC One and that baffles me.  Same manufacturer, same basic design, yet this has weaker sound.  If I had my choice, I'd rather the phone sound worse, not the tablet I actually use for video/music content.  Four, this tablet's overall speed performance appears to be degrading.  I've noticed it taking longer and longer to load/reload apps and websites.  I'm hoping most of this can be attributed to Android 5.0.1 problems and not the hardware.  Worst case scenario, I try out Cyanogenmod, but I shouldn't have to!\n\nThose problems aside, I have actually enjoyed using the Nexus 9.  I like the size, the screen looks good, and most importantly it doesn't run iOS.  While I was disappointed in the speakers, they're still better than most other tablets.  Double tapping the screen to wake is great, every touch device really needs to make that standard.  The main camera is good enough, though I'd rather they remove it altogether and slash $50 off the price or better yet make 64gb the entry level Nexus 9 (16 and 32 are a joke, thankfully USB OTG is a thing).  The processor is a beast for gaming, but the Play store is still lacking on that front.  Also, it helps that I bought it for $350 + $50 in Google Play credit (which should be the standard deal, $400 is overpriced).\n\n*UPDATE 6/25/15*\nI've had some time with it since Android 5.1.1 dropped and some of my initial concerns have been addressed.  It no longer slows down with use.  I believe this was attributed to a memory leak problem that 5.1.1 patched.  5.1.1 may have also addressed my screen flicker problem as that doesn't happen anymore (or I just don't notice it anymore).  As a result I bumped my score from 3 to 4 stars.  It's still overpriced however, the Nexus 9 build quality just doesn't justify its cost when you can often find a ipad mini 2 for less or even an ipad air 2 at a similar cost these days."}

The size is perfect in my opinion, easy to hold in one hand and still a good sized screen. I was concerned about the light bleed comments and they are true. When the OS was updating I noticed some minor bleed in the one corner against the black screen. I was concerned it wasn't going to work out. But once I got it running, I can't see it anymore. I got this for taking notes on PDFs. Using Lecture Notes and so far so good (once you get the settings on the app right). Great pure android experience."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Let me preface by saying that I am a huge fan of stock android and Google's Nexus line of devices.  I have the Nexus 7 (2012) and Nexus (2013).  I even purchased the LG G Pad 8.3 Google Play Edition for my father. Unfortunately, my 2013 N7 died on me recently and I am only left with the 2012 edition.  And, if you are like me and own a 2012 N7 you know that over time the device does get slow/sluggish due to the outdated hardware.\n\nAlthough, my N7 2012 can get slow when running too many apps, it still works like a boss and has not died on me yet.  My biggest reason for getting a new device is the experience.  My N7 2012 just isn't doing it for me anymore and I need something with a little more pep.  Below you will find my observations on the Nexus 9.\n\nScreen:  2048x1536 display looks nice but there is noticeable light bleed in all 4 corners there I found on all my units. Love the 4:3 aspect ratio.  I find doing almost everything is better in this display.  The only con that people seem to have is watching videos. Even though most video are formatted in 16:9, I, personally, don't find the black bars at the top and bottom to be a big deal.\n\nBattery: Averaging only about 4.5-5 hours of on screen time with mix use: gaming, streaming videos (netflix and youtube), web browsing and emailing. Definitely not getting any where near the reported 9.5 hours Google claims.  Also, it takes about 4-5 hours to charge from about almost dead battery.  While gaming the battery does seem to heat up quite a bit.  Even with simple web browsing, I've notice the back of the tablet heating up near the camera.\n\nSoftware:  This is where Google shines.  Lollipop is a dream. The smoothest version of android to date. That with the great specs makes this a pure treat to use and especially consider it's running stock android.\n\nHardware:  The tactile power and volume rocker buttons are a disappointment because they are not raise high enough.  The screen is fair, at best, due to the uneven back light bleed present on these devices. Video quality for some reason while watching Netflix isn't quite as sharp as my Samsung Tab S 10.5 or even the Ipad Air.  I'm not sure why but if you look close at details it isn't there on the Nexus 9.\n\nSpeakers:  Front facing speakers are definitely great to see and the sound coming out of them have meet my expectation.  You really can't go wrong with front facing speakers.  Some of the best speakers on any tablet.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this tablet is probably more suited for the die-hard android fan looking for a bare bones, clean version of android as possible in a 4:3 aspect ratio.  But, for the asking price of $399 and $479, for the 16/32 gb models, I think it is way too much.  Even with the $50 price drop of each device, I still think it is overprice.  Not because it's a bad device but because the build quality is so poor. This device is certainly packing some premium software and internal hardware but the external hardware is not up to par.  I may not be a fan of Apple, but I will give them credit where credit is due.  Their hardware is superb.\n\nIn all honesty, this device should be price at $299 and $329 for the 16/32 gb models. If you are on the fence about this, I would probably hold off until they can fix the quality control issue and see if the price drops some more.  I really want to give the Nexus 9 a shot but I've already received and returned four defective units all with an excessive amount of backlight bleed.  With that said, I've decided to and have already purchased a Samsung Tab S 10.5.  I don't care for Touchwiz (Magazine UX) overlay but it's not that intrusive.  The real crowning jewel of the Tab S is the display. The best display I've seen on any tablet - hands down.\n\nAs it stands, I would only give the Nexus 9 a 3 star rating.  The build quality is really what upsets me considering the asking price.  If the build quality was better it could easily be a 5 star device.  If it had a super AMOLED display like the Samsung Tab line it would definitely be a 5 star device.  Maybe when they release a Nexus 9 2nd edition in 2015, they can get it right (*fingers crossed*).  For now, I'll pass."}

I was also upset by the available ram in the 16 gig unit. I returned the 16 gig for the white 32 gig unit that will arrive soon. I have high hopes for this unit since the memory storage should be fine now and i hope its one of the units that have the slightly larger power / volume buttons since they were a pain.

It's very fast, performs very well.\n\nI wasn't too sure about the screen, since it's only 2048x1536 and is 4:3 instead of 16:9 (e.g. \"full screen\" instead of \"widescreen\"). I came from a 10\" tablet running 2560x1600, which is wide screen. However, the screen looks great. No issues here.\n\nThe performance is spectacular. It runs circles around every other device I have in all the real world use and benchmarks.\n\nThe software is stock Android. No surprises here. No goofy add-ons to slow things down, get in the way, or take up device space.\n\nThe size is much better than I thought. It's still large enough for a couple of people to watch a movie or show together when desired (e.g. on a plane, in a  hotel room, whatever) but is far easier to hold than a 10\" tablet. Even going down to 8\" turns it into a much more solo device than the Nexus 9.\n\nSpeaking of watching movies... finally, a device with front facing speakers. I've always been astounded how many tablets and phones have speakers that are aimed away from your ears. The sound is great and you don't even have to get behind it or cup your hands around it to hear the sound well.\n\nThe storage, at 16GB, is low, but all of my movies and music are in the cloud and little else takes up much room. Sure, I can't load a dozen graphics-intensive games, but it can handle a few at a time and swapping them out is easy enough.\n\nThe cameras work, but I almost never use a tablet to take pictures."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I bought this almost at launch even after the initial reviews. I wanted another tablet to replace my 2013 Nexus 7 that crashed. I typically use my tablet for reading books and consuming media via apps like Facebook, or Twitter and using other apps like YouTube. I basically use it as I think most others do and it's basically something ultra portable that I can do some quick google searches on or watch a YouTube video on here and there.\n\nBest think about this tablet for me personally is the OS. I'm a fan of Android and it's nice to have a device that basically gets every Android update first. I get to try out new experiences ahead of most other tablet users and I really enjoy it. I could have gone to a Nexus 7 2014 but I was really looking forward to the bigger screen on this device.\n\nThe hardware is great, not fantastic. It's got a beautiful display and metal bands around the side so it doesn't feel like a cheap toy at all. The volume and power buttons are a little difficult to navigate at times and I am always feeling around a little more than I sense I should have to in hopes that I'm going to hit the right button.\n\nThe device is pretty great on performance. Android Lollipop initially had some issues on this device in particular. It seemed to slow it down a bit but now that there have been updates to Lollipop everything is running pretty smoothly and I can only hope that things continue to head in that direction for this device.\n\nThis tablet, with my needs in mind, does an excellent job. If you're on the fence about picking one up I'd wait. You're not really missing anything here that you probably won't get more of in the next iteration. If you are new to Android and are looking at a tablet to dip your toes in with and test the waters, you can not do much better than this but beware the price. There are cheaper tablets out there that won't received OS updates so quickly but are still adequate."}

They agreed to fix it but made me pay 30 or so dollars to ship it to Texas. They kept it for 5 days and sent it back. I expected problems to be corrected but I had to call them and ask exactly what they did fix. It seems to me that they did almost nothing. It still has light bleed issues (with darkened screen). The buttons seem no better than before. The back flexing seems to be better but I might as well have never sent the device for all the fixes that were never done (so it seems). My advice is to make sure before you spend your money. $479.00 is a lot of money to spend on a device with such poor quality.

Android Lollipop - tablet comes with the newest version of Lollipop and will be one if the first to get software updates.\n2. Build materials - if you have used a previous Nexus, then you know what to expect with a \"rubbery\" back texture, Nexus branding and a very nice metal frame around.\n3. Front facing speakers - Finally!! Should be standard on all tablets.\n\nCON'S:\n1. Price - way to expensive for a heavy, odd shaped tablet with medicos specs (see PPI and processor)\n2. Weight - Is Heavy! Being a 9\" tablet and squared at that, coupled with its weight makes it uncomfortable to use one handed.\n3. Screen - it's good but 2013 7 spoiled us on what Google can do with its partners. Look at Samsung's Tab S with a QHD display at 359 PPI. Plus, I personally am not a fan of 4:3 ratio and love 16:9/16:10 for movie watching and portability.\n\nGoogle has spoiled us giving high quality devices at lower than expected prices, but that's not the case with the Nexus 9.

I like Android Lollipop from a user interface point of view but have seen a number of system crashes and desktop crashes that I never experienced with either KitKat or Jelly Bean.  Also there seem to be a number of long delays between switching apps which appear to be CPU bound.  I am not sure this is specific to my configuration or generic.  I have 150+ apps installed but regularly use only about 20.  I have read complaints about light leakage at the screen borders and can see a tiny bit when the screen is completely black such as when booting but do not consider it to interfere with my normal use of the device.  There were also complaints of flex on the back of the case which my device does not have.  The case is solid and I like the feel of the of the material. The device is a bit pricey compared to the Nexus 7 but overall I would recommend the Nexus 9 to anyone who wants a larger form factor."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "This tablet is the best Android device on the market. It's pure Google which gives it a distinct advantage over any other tablet primarily because of bloatware --- ahem Samsung.\n\nI write and own a small business, so working on the go is key and not having to carry my MacBook Pro everywhere is a nice plus, fortunately with this device I've been able to achieve all of my daily tasks and more on this device alone. iPad's don't get me wrong are the best, but for using Skype and multi-tasking Android is a clear winner in it's ability to handle more Windows based processes and of course functionality which is why I use this over the iPad I currently have.\n\nBattery life for me running Skype, Chrome & Google Docs is between 6-8 hours. Not what HTC has promised, but for me it's actually ok since I'm around an outlet 90% of my time.\n\nMy only complaints are:\nAfter 4-5 days of use, the tablet now takes longer to boot and applications take 10-12 seconds to open (use to be instant). HTC said it's a known issue and they are working on a fix, but no ETA.\nCamera quality is horrible - fortunately I didn't buy this for the camera, that's what my iPhone 6+ is for, but I want to point this flaw out\nCamera section of the tablet is always hot when using the tablet, even when the camera isn't in use\nHTC has horrible support\nNot all Apps in Google Play work with this device - as developers update their apps it'll be corrected."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "After reading all the negative reviews on this tablet, I was reluctant to order one. I have used a Moto x phone and a Nexus 10 tablet since they first became available and I have been very satisfied with both. I use Google apps and services every day. I keep my data in the cloud and this works well for me. I am retired and do my computing at home where WiFi is available. So when Amazon offered $50 off on the Nexus 9 I ordered a white WiFi only 32 GB Nexus 9.\nThe first thing I checked was for light bleed. My tablet has very little light bleed. It's not noticeable unless you're really looking for it. I then checked the back for a soft spot in the center and it was just fine unless I approached a very firm grip. The power button and volume rocker were tactile and worked quite well. I used the option to set up my Nexus 9 from my Nexus 10 and I have over half my memory still available.\nI've read that the Nexus 9 tablet has snappy performance and I certainly would agree with that assessment. The screen is clear, bright, and has great color reproduction. The aspect ratio is different than the Nexus 10. I find myself doing many things, such as reading books or gmail or surfing the web, in portrait mode. There is letterboxing when watching movies in landscape mode, but this doesn't bother me. Some may feel differently.\nI have only had my Nexus 9 for several days, but so far I am very satisfied. I have a Macbook pro and a Surface pro 2 but I use my Android devices the most. Google and HTC have produced a great tablet for my uses and circumstances. Others may feel differently but it is nice to have so many choices to fit our individual needs. I would wholeheartedly recommend this tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Here's what we do on a tablet. We listen to music, internal and streaming. We always use external Bluetooth speakers and headphones. We watch Netflix. We use it to take notes and make lists (there are some great Android handwriting apps and all you need is a $5 stylus). We use Office 365 for Word, and Excel on it using the Android App, which includes OneDrive cloud storage. We shop online, we play games on it (no processor intense games). The processor has no lag time or delays for anything we stream, for the writing apps, for the games, for the office products, for the onboard music... For us, and we have a lot of technoogy, it's really fast. We use it as a camera. It's a great tablet for everything that we need it to do.\nThe size is perfect compared to the Nexus 10 (which we still have and use at home). It's a little smaller but A LOT lighter. I always read the one-star ratings first and a lot of times they can scare me off of a product. But I'm honestly telling you, for every review where a person has a complaint or says \"don't buy this tablet\", if your uses are like mine, I've got to say \"don't listen to these people\". I'm thinking that these are the people who don't know that you have to take the clear wrap off the screen and complain that the tablet has a terrible picture. Or they plug the charging cord into the computer when it's turned off and complain that the battery doesn't take a charge. Or, worst of all, the people who give a product one-star because FedEx had a trailer overturn and it arrived a day late and the outside box had a bent corner. And maybe some people do get one that doesn't work out of the box (mine has worked perfectly since day one). But that's the beauty of buying from Amazon, there are no hassles to return it and get another one.\nSo, in my opinion, I'm happy with the tablet. It does everything I want it to do, it's worked very well once they fix the bugs in the operating system, the unit itself has never done anything \"wonky\", it's light, it's sturdy, and it's quick... This tablet works and it works well and Nexus tablets have historically held up well for us (we bought the 7\" and 10\" the day they first came out). Don't worry about the one-stars, Look at it this way, a product like this HAS to have SOME redeeming quality. You can't argue that there are things that ARE good on this. So it deserves a two-star at least just because it can't be total crap. So if someone gives this a one-star, they have some sort of anger issue and I'm glad that I don't have to live with them."}

Long and short: if you are looking for a book size tablet that is somewhat larger than the 7-8.4\" but smaller than the usual 9.7-10+\" offerings, this is a nice intermediate possibility. Big enough to read A4/Letter pdfs, but small enough to hold with one hand for extended periods of time. On a very decent screen and fast CPU to boot. Nova Launcher (Prime) is very smooth on it. 429, maybe even 399 would have been a more fitting price given the competition and overall build quality (I got mine in the first batch and so shelled out 479.)"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I did not get my money's worth.  At release, this tablet was slow.  Apps were okay, but the OS was sluggish.  Really disappointing for a flagship device.  Several months into my ownership, there was a software release that seemed like it unlocked the full potential of the tablet.  Things were snappier and it was finally the flagship tablet I thought I was buying in the first place.  But then the stability issues started.  One of the worst is that it unlocks to a black screen.  You can wait, but nothing ever happens.  You can tap the power button to put it back to sleep, but it just goes back to the black screen when you unlock it again.  The only workaround is to fully power cycle the tablet.  This is not a good option, as the tablet takes almost 5 minutes to boot.  This is apparently an inherent problem with the device, as it's been slow to boot from day one.\nAdditionally, tech support on this device is terrible.  Despite it being a Google-branded device, they won't support you unless you purchased it through the Google store.  HTC support is terrible (when you go to their support page, the Nexus 9 isn't even listed as a device).  Amazon provides a 30-day return policy, but no technical support.  The only support you can get is through forums, and the solution frequently involves complicated wipe-and-flash solutions that require a decent amount of technical savvy.\nAs much as I wanted to love this device - and did, for a brief time that was tarnished by my initial fresh-from-the-box experience - I haven't used it in over a year.  It's been a waste of time and money."}

Then did some search on the Internet and noticed I wasn't alone and my device is the not the only one having this problem. However didn't find much help online. Then one google forum link gave me the solution which was doing factory reset:\nhttps://productforums.google.com/forum/#!mydiscussions/nexus/gSeBi3-kFXg\n\nAfter this I got to start using this. I noticed a bit of screen flicker originally especially on a screen which doesnt changes - ie. the wall paper, a html page. Again on researching I found this is a known problem. However after playing with screen brightness I am not noticing the issue any more while actually using it for games or browsing. So I don't have any other complaints on this.\n\nThe screen application icons seems flushed or washed out - again it appears it is how Lollypop is meant to be. iPad graphics are much more sharper and high in resolution I suppose.\n\nI also took a dark picture by keeping the tablet on table with camera facing down with no flash. So I got a black image background which I have set has wall paper. After that I am getting like an iPad experience which I was used to. So my little change helped me with better experience.\n\nI didn't notice any LIGHT BLEED which others are saying a lot about - though I didn't extensively test it with various display settings. I don't think I should do full screen bright and then find issues as that's not what I am going to use it - brightness under 20-30% is good for most use and no bleed whatsoever.\n\nBattery does drain fast on playing games - but not that fast So I am OK with what it has.\n\nAlso, heating issues - the device does heats up a little on top mid/left but I think thats normal with any other device. Even my IPad used to gets heated up when the battery was draining with high energy games.\n\nMulti tasking is awesome and loads of games remain in memory.\n\nMy advise to others - be patient, you will start liking it after a while when you get used to the device and appreciate that you have not put your money on a useless device. The device will be a winner in a long run and you will be proud of your device."}

A few weeks removed from that, the Nexus 9 has improved somewhat, but it is a *great* tablet for only the biggest Android fan.  For all others, it is a passable device, with some remaining build quality issues and less than optimised software.\n\nThe build quality of my own Nexus 9 is good, but not great.  It doesn't come near iPad quality, yet doesn't have the plasticky feel that Samsung devices have.  The metal band around the edge of the device helps that, giving a steady feel to the tablet.  The back panel is soft-touch plastic and is clipped into the frame, which means creaking and flexibility are more than possible.  The buttons have been very hit or miss - some devices have buttons that protrude from the frame and while very small, are still easy to press.  Other Nexus 9s have buttons that sit nearly flush with the metal band, making them next to impossible to find and press.\n\nThe screen is beautiful, with good color and brightness that works well in nearly all regular use situations.  The 4:3 ratio is useful for web browsing and typing, but lends itself to a less than ideal movie viewing setup.  The front facing speakers are loud, although not terribly detailed in their output, with some mud in nearly every range.  However, the speakers are far and away better than any tablet's simply because they are placed on the front of the device, not the side or bottom.\n\nThe Nexus 9 is a good tablet.  It has flaws (including having about $50 more dollars on its price than it should) but it excels and displaying the new Android Lollipop software.  A great size for travel, the office and home, the Nexus 9 should be considered by anyone looking for a tablet that isn't made by Apple."}

I use the device for photography viewing, general web browsing, and very light gaming or productivity work.  I've got large(r) hands than most so the size of this may be too big for some, but not me (wear a 2XL glove).  Text is crisp and makes for a good photo viewer when paired with WiFi to my Canon (via DSLR Controller) or Fujifilm X series camera (and the Fujifilm apps).\n\nWhere this device comes up short is quality control.  Significant light-bleed on dark images (very noticeable on boot up from power down/up state).  I got the white back, but it is a little more \"slick\" than the black, but not as much of a fingerprint magnet as the black.  The volume and power buttons don't have a quality feel to them (not that the Nexus 7 did).  That said, considering the price point, the iPad is a better value when you consider the quality feel and use of that device and the available app choices you have over Google Play store.  If you are going to price this up near the iPad, you need to match the quality of the iPad hardware and HTC fails on that front.  Also, I would like to see more storage on these devices.  I would like to see a 64GB & 128GB versions (at a lower price)\n\nGiven all the negatives, I am going to keep the device, because it meets my simple needs, but the price does need to drop on it for it to sell.

Native Android has come a long way since the early versions and, for most people, a custom skin (like TouchWIZ) is not as necessary anymore. Unless you really need the extra screen real estate, this is a great tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I love Google for making this. It is an excellent tablet. But I'm not going to fanboy, this Tablet has several small issues. Actually, one BIG issue is the lack of storage space. It comes with no SD card slot, and at most has 32 GB of internal storage. The Black one is very prone to getting fingerprints all over it. Also, I'm not really a fan of all the Google Apps, but I guess it's less annoying than the Bloatware on other devices.\n\nI think this is a good tablet, and that all those issues are fairly small, even the storage one."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Based on the price point and my general happiness with the Nexus 7 (2012 model) I already own, I disregarded most of the sour grapes commentary about the light bleed problems on the Nexus 9.\n\nHowever, they're all right. There is a huge variation in manufacturing tolerances.\n\nIn the picture below, you'll see the first Nexus 9 I received from Amazon on the RIGHT (Serial Prefix: HT4B9) and the second (an exchange from Amazon) on the LEFT (Serial Prefix: HT4AN)\n\nI'm obviously keeping the exchange (the one on the left).\n\nIn all fairness, the picture exaggerates the problem a little. It's not _that_ bad. But if you're watching a letterboxed movie, it's noticeable enough to be distracting.\n\nIt's not all roses and gumdrops with the second one though: the vibrate motor is actually audible on the second one. On the first one, I don't think there's any way an adult human could hear the thing vibrate as you type. On the second one, the motor is definitely audible. It's not so loud that people will change seats on the train to get away from you, but loud enough that you'll note that it's not silent.\n\nLastly, the screen itself is slightly warmer on the second model. There's no way to calibrate the color balance so I have to imagine it's a different panel altogether. Also, the off-angle viewing is different .. not really better on one or the other, just a little different.\n\nOn both units, the 'hollow back' problem that people report is present. But I'm putting this thing in a case so it doesn't really matter to me.\n\nPoint being: you might have to order and exchange a couple of these before you get one you like. And no surprise, Amazon is a champ about making that easy as pie."}

It does have a sort of premium feel with its metal frame, but for the asking price I would have hoped that nexus would have pushed the envelope a little more. Perhaps going with an all metal construction akin to an iPad. That being said tho, you aren't getting short changed when it comes to the specs. Incredibly beefy and the OS is so smooth.\n\nTL;DR: if you love android, no brainer. IMO best android tablet to date. HTC did a great job\n\nNow to just find a decent case"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "The Nexus 9 tablet has a screen that is brighter than my Nexus 7 tablet or Nexus 5 phone.  It came with Android 5.00 Lollipop installed, and received an over-the-air update to 5.01 within a week.  All of my Google apps from the N7 were imported automatically, and I had to manually install all of the apps from the Amazon App store.  I had a bit of trouble installing the Amazon Appstore app, conspiracy buffs might think Google designed it that way, but eventually I got it installed and now get automatic updates from both places.\n\nPros: bright screen, fast processing, great resolution\nCons: heavier than I thought it would be (14.5 oz.), no wireless charging\n\nBottom line:  I like this tablet a lot.  I do wish the form factor was more like the Nexus 7 (widescreen) but I guess Google wanted to shape it more like an iPad.  Disappointed that I can't use my wireless charging pad with it, I kind of assumed that wireless was the future direction and my N5 and N7, both from 2013, have wireless charging.  I bought the keyboard cover and it works great.  I like the way it props the tablet up on your lap while sitting.  The keyboard attaches with magnets and weighs an additional 12 ounces, making the N9 + keyboard come in at over 1.5 lbs. Still, it weighs less than a laptop and with the keyboard it makes a good travel package."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Updated 12/18 See Below\n\nI really wanted to like this device. But in the end, it was not workable for me. I saw other bad reviews, and figured they either got a bad device or had a chip on their shoulders. Now, I'm one of 'those people'\n\nWith just a little light web browsing, this device got unbearably hot. To the point where my hands literally hurt. If I had this on my lap, my man parts started to hurt and get hot. Tablets should not put out this amount of heat. If I can't hold the device, then I can't use it.\n\nThe screen had severe problems so I couldn't watch movies with it. Fairly large blotches of white in all four corners. Sometimes the blotches would seem to move around depending on what I tried to watch. I tried adjusting the brightness. Even with the brightness turned way down, the blotches interfered with watching a movie. And then, the rest of the picture would be too dark.\n\nI read several reviews where others had a similar problems. Perhaps these are just kinks being worked out of the build process. But when I consider the premium price tag for this device, even if my problems were fixed, I don't think the devices floors the competition.\n\nI sincerely hope that your mileage varies. But ultimately I had to return mine.\n\nUpdated 12/18\n\nAmazon has processed my return/refund. I really have to commend Amazon.\n\nI also wanted to add a bit to the review as if the problems I had were fixed so to speak. I did have the unit for one week so I got a good feel for how it operates.\n\nSize/Form Factor\n\nIt is best to compare the Nexus 9 to the iPad, not the mini. For productivity tasks, it is great. Plenty of screen real estate to get to all your files. The build quality was pretty good, and the device was thin and light.\n\nHowever, if your main focus is entertainment: movies, netflix etc. then it may not be the best tablet. It's more than the 4:3 ratio. The screen itself was fairly lacking for a flagship product. Even when I wasn't watching movies, just browsing or using apps the screen would be so washed-out it was hard to see. Then if I turned the brightness down to get rid of the bleed, then the rest of the stuff was too dark to use.\n\nBattery\n\nI found the battery to get unbearably hot. So much that my hands would hurt so much I couldn't use it. The battery life was also short. I suspect that both of these problems are related and my have been a bad unit. Also, it took fairly long to charge.\n\nStock Android\n\nOver-rated. I love android and HTC. I have two HTC smart phones and LOVE them. As much as I liked not having bloatware, I really missed all the spit and polish that vendors add in. Simple things like the volume controls not being on the swipe-down status menu. Basically, all the little touches that make an OS seem polished are missing.\n\nSpeed\n\nThis may be related to the battery issues, but I found web browsing to be slow. I tried several browsers and all had the same issues.\n\nHowever, apps were very fast. Even apps that use the internet such as drive, dropbox, onedrive, onenote, etc. I could load office files from my cloud accounts and view/edit edit them with ease."}

I have not experienced any of those problems at all! It's a very fluid operating system with no lag.  I love the screen size, not too big, not too small. Battery has been great, retains power during use and standby way better than my 2012 Nexus 7.  The 4 star rather than 5 rating is because the tablet takes hours to charge, literally will say something like (update)\"1.5 hours until fully charged \" even when already at around 80%. Although this is not so bad since the battery seems to be lasting pretty long.\n\nOtherwise, very nice feel and weight balance. Nice brilliant screen. Sorry, can't speak for the speaker quality, haven't tried them yet.\n\nI have only had the tablet a few days, but will update review if anything changes plus or minus."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Great tablet with plenty of power thanks to nVidia's CPU. Unlike it's Nexus 7 predecessor, the 9 has a motor in it for haptic response when typing and for any other vibrate related functions. The tablet does lack the ability to charge wirelessly but that doesn't seem too much of a loss. The display is bright, colorful, sports a greater than 1080p resolution and is nice too look at, if a little power hungry.\n\nBecause the tablet is in the 4:3 format rather than 16:9 there are some compatibility issues that you may run into when running applications. For example, I've been unable to get Five Nights at Freddy's to run. I expect that this problems will lessen with the passage of time as 4:3 isn't all that uncommon of a format. In fact, it's the format Apple uses for its tablets. Additionally, 4:3 is a great format for browsing the web which I quite enjoy doing on the tablet."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I usually buy android and windows tablets once in a while because of curiosity and the hope that they can replace my top performance laptops. Unfortunately they never do and after 2-3weeks of use i end up selling them on craigslist. Windows tablets are great, but probably on 11 inch or bigger screen only. Anything smaller than that is hardly clickable most of the time even with capacitative pens.\nI got a good deal on a nexus 9 and i was eager to try the new 64 bit experience on android tablet. I got satisfied overall, but got very dissapointed by android's internet browsing experience. A lot of the websites require an app to view the website properly, there are more pop-ups than in windows now(Surprisingly not as many viruses, yet) and the biggest problem - no flash player for watching movies or play games. They say most of  the websites will move from flash to html5 sooner or later which would make watching videos possible without using an app.  I doubt most of the websites with video content are in a hurry to trade the billions $ they make on apps(marketing) for better internet browsing experience with no apps necessary to use.\nOther than the internet experience this tablet has great display, it is very ergonomic, camera is good, performance is awesome. Stock android is my favorite. Rooting the device takes a few minutes to research and apply. Mulltitasking is great with no freezing and refreshing of the apps between the switches.\nCons:\nNo usb 3.0 , no hdmi , no sd card slot"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I ignored all the warnings about build quality and hoped some updated shipments had come in (ordered 2nd week of Dec)... and gambled.\n\nAnd lost.\n\nStraight out of the box: massive light bleed, flimsy back that made both squishy and popping sounds when holding the tablet, key travel, volume buttons sunken in and practically unusable.\n\nI'll tell you what though...Lollipop is so good it almost makes up for it.  Almost. I plan to RMA these until I finally get one that works properly. The software experience will be so good it's worth the hassle. The first replacement arrives by FedEx tomorrow, wish me luck...\n\nI also want to mention I owned an iPad Air 2 for about a week before deciding to give the Nexus 9 a chance.  The iPad was useless compared to the versatility of Android.\n\nUPDATE:  Just received second replacement unit... I didn't think it could be possible, but this one is worse than the first.  The volume buttons are completely flush and I couldn't even get volume up to work without digging my fingernail into it.  The light bleed is also worse on this one than the first.  Back still squishy and makes crackling noise just holding device in hand normal.  I want this device to work sooooo badly...  Guess I'll have to return and hope for better luck on the 3rd one.\n\nUPDATE #2:  Well after requesting to RMA the 2nd one, I got an email directly from Amazon customer service. They said they'd be happy to try yet a 3rd replacement but that they couldn't guarantee it would have the same problems.  They also offered to allow me to return it for a complete refund OR to keep it with it's defects for a 40% discount (or a refund of $172 of the $429 I paid).  Hell, yes!  A tablet with all these quality control problems is *not* worth $429, but for $257...  Yes, I have to say having a tablet with the latest version of Android is def worth $257 and Amazon made up for what otherwise would have left me pretty bitter...  It does work well (mostly)... but just *feels* like a $250 tablet not a $429 one.\n\nThanks, Amazon, for stellar customer service!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "The tablet is over all great and the more I use it the more I enjoy it.  First, I am not a big tech guy.  I use the tablet mainly for reading, research, watching movies and web browsing.  I do some gaming and some productivity.  But spec number and all that, I don't know.  I just can tell my opinion on how it works.\n\nWhat makes it a 5 star is the stock android.  Lollypop Android is wonderful.  Hands down all around improvement and the fact there are no other skins most other android tablets may have, make it superb.  It is very clean, simple and efficient.\n\nThe tablet/hardware itself is a good tablet.  I would give the tablet 4 stars at the current price.\n\nSet up was quick and easy.  Display is beautiful and when compare to the original Nexus 7 (N7) the pictures are a little richer.  The screen aspect is 4:3 so the actual picture in wide screened movies is just a little bigger than the N7.  However, if it is not a wide screened movie, it is much bigger.  For those who like to read, it is far superb with the 4:3 and the 8.9 inch display is just about perfect  especially for those of us who are needing reading glasses.  For the web, it is much faster than the N7  browsing and down loading is literally lighting fast with good WiFi.  In fact, it is as fast as our PC with a LAN line.  Apps open quickly  there are one or two apps that will take about 1 second to open  youtube being one  I doubt it would have been noticed had I not seen that in a review.  Once youtube is open, it quickly goes from one video to another.  Another big plus are the front facing speakers  they are to par with my daughters Kindle Fire.  Games  candy crush, off road legends, solitaire  work flawlessly and the graphics are superb.  However, I am not a big gamer.  Overall the processor is fast and efficient.\n\nThe table size is a bit big for one handed handling.  I do have smaller hands.  With the case, it is more of a one handed tablet with the case being softer and sticking to the hands better.  I use the trim IVSO cover that has a nice tacky backing.\n\nThe build feels solid.  I read several reviews where this was critiqued specifically with the back panel being flimsy.  I have the white 32 GB model and it does not bend or flex  it feels solid.  The metal band on the side gives it a good feel.  It does not feel flimsy to me.  The power and volume buttons do not stick out as much as I would like.  I have found if I run my finger over the top bevel edge I can feel the two fine.  Another critique is bleeding light on the screen edge  I do have a small amount of bleed on the upper side  I am unsure if it would have been noticed if I did not know about it in the first place.  You mainly see it at night when watching a side screened movie due to the black boxes above and below the wide screen.  Again, I am unsure if it would have been noticed.  The tablet does get warm (not hot) on the corner around the camera.  The battery life is good, better that the N7.  Once nice improvement is it charges a little quicker than the N7 and will gain charge when the tablet is being used, where as the N7 would still lose charge with use when plugged in.  The camera is fine, but I am not one who will count on a tablet or phone to function as a camera.\n\nOver all, I think the tablet is nice and most enjoyable.  I do think it is overpriced and if not for having stock android I would give it a 4.  At a premium price, I think there should be no light bleeding.  But lollypop is so nice and clean, that for me the small imperfections are ok.  The only people I would not recommend this tablet to are those who primarily use it for movies and shows.  I would steer you toward the more 16:9 tablets.  I am very happy with the tablet and would recommend it highly."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "This review is written a month and three days after I first got this device.\n\nLet me start this review by saying I'm an avid Android fan and power user (rooted all my phones and love to tinker with them), and Nexus lover. I need a 4:3 aspect ratio tablet for work and personal purposes, so up until a month ago, I used an iPad. When I heard this tablet was not only Android, but a Nexus (an HTC to boot), and 4:3, I knew I'd preorder it. On to the actual review.\n\nWhen I got this tablet, the first thing I did was root it. That was easy, as it always is for Nexuses. Everything was great, I had adblock on it, I had Tasker running, and I was enjoying Lollipop, but then I started to notice issues with it: lag and freezing on simple apps, like readers and YouTube, stuttering when multitasking, bleeding of the LCD, etc. Being a Nexus fan, I wrote these off as little quirks and didn't mind them much. Then it started to crash.\n\nI've owned Nexus devices for a little over 3 years, and during those three years, I've had roughly four crashes (the phone/tablet automatically restarting due to an error) in those years. In owning this tablet, it's crashed five times... I chalked it up to the new version of Lollipop, and the fact that this is one of the first 64-bit Android devices. This is partly the case, but I also found out that it also has something to do with rooting the tablet.\n\nAfter all these issues, I unrooted it and it worked just fine. I've had no issues since then. I feel like one of the draws of a Nexus device is the fact that it's a very open piece of hardware that plays nicely with modifications, yet this device glitches and messes up regularly when you do that. I'm sure fixes will come in the future, but if you're wanting to get this tablet now and jump right in to modding it, I suggest you wait. It's a good enough device on it's own, but it leaves me feeling regret that I preordered it. It's great, just not $400+ great."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Pros - 64 bit processor that is extremely fast with the latest update,  I think a lot of the complaints on performance was the software was not ready for the first 64 bit Android device.  However Google seems to have addressed that very quickly as the day I received the tablet from Amazon the update was available.  Lollipop (Android 5.0) overall is very polished and refined.  I also may have been lucky but I have no build quality issues.  Also I believe Google halted production to address these issues as Amazon sent me an email stating that there was an \"unexpected manufacturer delay\". Has good battery life. Screen size is great and I don't mind aspect ratio but it also on my con list for now as well, see below\n\nCons - Most apps are scaling to a 4:3 aspect ratio of this device which is a screen size that has not really been used with a Android's before.  It will take some time for apps to get updated to support this.  This has been an issue with all mobile devices including Apple and will only get resolved over time by the app developers.  Some other cons are not the actual device but some decisions in OS itself.  While I really like most of the OS some things like notifications have completely changed and I am liking it.  This is probably my biggest complaint, but as this issue is software and not hardware it would not stop me from recommending this Tablet."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Originally I owned Samsung made Nexus 10 inch and was very happy with that unit, other than its weight and size. It was becoming a bit unwieldy for reading books and just plain web browsing. So, when Nexus 9 came out, I sold my N10 and picked a N9 at BestBuy (I figured if I get a defective unit with light bleed or stuck buttons, it will be easier to switch at local retailer). And, oh boy, was that a good call...\n\nThe Nexus 9 that I got looked good and had no light bleed. Excellent. Loved the size and weight and general design. Lollipop OS was good and fresh. Reading books and web browsing was a pleasure. Games ran fast. It did have a slowdown and occasional non-response when waking up from sleep. But a 5.01 firmware update took care of that. Life is good until 2 days later it just will not wake up period. No amount of charging or holding the power button will make it up. Annoying, so I get in the car and drive to BestBuy and exchange it for another unit. HUGE LIGHT BLEEDS in every corner. Oh well, drive it back again. And again, light bleeds but less this time. Wow. Now I am stuck with an expensive, \"premium\" Android tablet that is definitely not premium quality. So I am thinking that Samsung S 8.4 with Super AMOLED screen is starting to look mighty good...\n\nWhat a disappointment from Google/HTC. Where is your quality control, guys? If that is how you want to compete with Apple and Samsungs of the world, I got news for you: you will lose your customers to them very quickly if you keep releasing products like that. Not only that, but I will now stay away from HTC made phones as well... \"Good\" job guys!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "It looks like Google planned step up to compete at the high end market with this. Nexus 9 offers many top of the line specs although many are poorly optimized.\n\nPro:\n-Lollipop is great. However other devices are going to receive this soon, so not really a reason to get Nexus 9 for it.....\n-Supposed powerful Tegra K1 for gaming. I am a gamer and excited about this, but there doesn't seem to be any good games to make use of this to make it an advantage over GPU offered by last year's devices.\n-Beautiful display, surprisingly this is biggest Pro\n-2GB RAM\n-No noticeable light bleed like many reviewer experienced.\n\nCons:\n-Overheating. One side of the device overheat to a uncomfortable level.(while the other is still noticeably warmer than any of 4 other tablets and 2 smartphones I owned) Being a handheld device, this is a huge con.\n-Battery. Nexus 9 last around the same as my 1 year old Nexus 7 2013. I was expecting it to last longer with the 6700mAh battery, the bigger screen maybe the issue. However the charging is about 20-30 minutes longer to charge from 35% to full compare to the Nexus 7 2013.\n-The back material looks fancy and high end, but not as comfortable to hold.\n-Price. I didn't mind the extra $ when I look at the spec before buying it, the extra 100-150 is not much for something you use often. I felt that it would be worth it. However, I feel that this is totally not worth the price after using it for a few days.\n\nOverall:\nI own a Nexus 7 2012, a Nexus 10, a Nexus 7 2013, and I used to own a Nexus 4. I have to say Nexus 9 is the worst Nexus tablet come at the highest price. This is a tablet which mashed up many top of the line spec with very poor optimization, totally ignoring the user and practical use of the device. I recommend NOT to buy this, hopefully next year's model will be better.\n\nI did some research on the overheating issue, it seems persist with many users. I can see seas of complain about this on some forums. People come up with different reasons. Some claim it is a hardware problem which will stay, and you can root and then clock to slow down Tegra K1 to make it less hot, which I think it is a very silly take on the very poorly make device. Some claim this is a firmware issue, which will be fixed in the next lollipop update. Google tech support is beating around the bush about this issue and has not given a firm answer from what I see.\n\nI am returning mine for a refund if there isn't a firmware update to fix the overheating problem in the next 1-2 weeks.\n\nI will update this to 4 or 3 stars if the next firmware update fix the overheating. Otherwise this stays."}

Anyway if you own an Android device in hand, an android tablet is way to go and vice versa with ios devices, as syncing is hell easy and cheap for apps and data.\n\nThe Nexus is very very well made, Apple fan boys will say whatever to defend apple, but its no cheap looking tab, specially the white option which I got.\n\nLight bleeds, I never noticed mine, untill on start up, when all the screen is black except 'Google' in the middle, I saw it, and it creates no difference in normal use. Over cautious people please mention you are too sensitive before the review.\n\nAndroid 5.0 is great, all was great untill glitches happened few times, excpect them to go in next update, and Android is Android when it comes to all this, though its getting better with every update they release.\n\nABSOLUTELY no lag at all, faster than ipad air period. Apps not made for tab or upgraded for Android 5.0 properly, still run butter smooth. Resizing of non-tablet apps don't rezize as stupid as the  Ipad does(which creates a small mobile in the middle of the screen) on this the apps scale properly and no such pixelation on any app I used.\n\nCapacity is not 32GB, you get around 26GB, yes like samsung, google put all thier apps. The moment you turn on your tab, lots of updates to do too.\n\nEmail app is shown as a different option, it takes you to the Gmail app as it claims it will show all your account(other provides included) in the Gmail app itself. Makes things easy, though 3rd party apps do the same thing, but not installing those saves space and hassel.\n\nScreen resolution is average for me. Yes its clear and warm, but pixels the highest resolution image on zoom and colours aren't bright and saturated enough. Maybe Iam used to Samsung SUPER AMOLED display. Otherwise reading and using for daily activities, doesnt make a difference.\n\nWiFi is fast, Boom speakers will make you deaf at full volumes(a good thing), sound quality is great. Touch is very responsive. Cameras are again the best on any tab I used, great front and back camera both. If you click pictures through a tab, then you won't find anything better, really trust me, got panamora, lens blur, powerful FLASH and many other features.\n\nOverall great tab for an attractive price, specially if you get an Amazon warehouse deal or any promotional offer."}

Even after reading some of the (disappointing) reviews - l decided to take a chance because, typically speaking, only the people that are really unsatisfied will post negative reviews - right?\n\nI believe the wide range of noted issues and mixed reviews of the Nexus 9 are fairly consistent.  Some people have no issues with the device at all.  Unfortunately, there are some fairly serious build issues that appear to be widely prevalent, depending on *which* review you read.\n\nNoted issues from various reviews (here on Amazon and on the web and forums):\n\n- Light Bleed (this is varying - however, all reviews point to it - so this becomes an issue on whether or not it affects you personally).\n- Recessed/Hard to press buttons\n- Overheating\n- Thin / \"springy\" / warping case\n- Lag\n- Slow charging times\n- Flickering screen\n\nTo be blunt - I *really* wanted to keep this tablet, however, I ultimately returned it because my particular unit had all of these noted issues (in some form or manner).\n\nCould I have dealt with the issues (assuming some of these issues could be addressed with software updates (Overheating, lag, flickering))?  Absolutely.  And I thought long and hard about whether or not I wanted to send the unit back.  However, when factoring in the *cost* of this device compared to other tablets in the market (especially during the Black Friday rush) - it makes keeping this tablet a non-starter considering the price (which was already a stretch).\n\nIn the past the Nexus line was all about value with cutting edge software releases. The Software is still there (and fantastic BTW), however, lost in translation somewhere is the bump in price.  While there have been earlier Nexus devices released at a similar price point, the difference here is that the market is now over-saturated with many options.\n\nIMHO - if HTC can correct the various hardware issues, along with a few software updates to address the other issues, then at that time - I'll seriously re-evaluate purchasing the N9.  However, also, I'd state that the price point is a bit too high considering the value you're receiving for the hardware when compared to other similarly performing devices on the market today (Samsung, NVIDIA Shield, LG, Apple, etc.).\n\nHopefully, the price will come better in-line (needs to be about $100 less) with similar offerings - along with the hardware issues addressed - that will make this a sure-fire purchase in the near future."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I have owned lots of Google and 3rd party Android products, and I have to say that the Nexus 9 is a big disappointment. Google really punted on this one, and apparently left everything to HTC when it came to putting together a product plan. Otherwise, some executives really need a reprimand for not protecting the Nexus brand better. This tablet is no where close to how significant the Nexus 7 2nd Gen was when it was released. That was a fine piece of hardware for its time. I have not received my keyboard folio yet, but I am hoping that will raise my feelings about the tablet.\n\nMany will complain about the backing materials which does have a hollow, flimsy, cheap feel to it, but that doesn't matter. First, I have found polished aluminum to be slippery and difficult to handle. Second, 99% of people immediately put their tablets into a case for protection. So I wish that professional online reviews would stop worrying about what is on the back of tablets. I would prefer a more solid feel like carbon fiber, but none of this will matter once the tablet is put into a case or folio. That being said, I would be happy to accept less high backing materials in return for a better price, but that is not the case here.\n\nI do not use the cameras on tablets, unlike my phones, so I have no comments on its performance.\n\nLollipop is fine enough, but most people will notice very little difference in usability from Lollipop versus KitKat. There are few features like the kid mode that are worth having, but there is nothing ground breaking to make Lollipop a must have for the average user.\n\nSince it is easiest (and limited), I will discuss the good first.\n\nPros:\n1. The screen is fine enough. Bleed is about the same as it was on the Nexus 7. Unless you are looking at something with predominantly precision scales of blacks/grays, or have a bad unit, it is not noticeable. For internet surfing and productivity, it is great 99.9% of the time.\n2. The speakers are not as bad as some reviews make them out to be. In fact, I feel that they perform very well for small form factor units. Peak volume is higher than most likely one ever needs, and your kids will be more than happy with Netflix on this unit. The front facing speakers are actually the only thing I consider unique and good about this tablet which makes it a consideration over anything else or over waiting for something better to come along.\n\nNow for the Cons:\n1. CPU: As a disclaimer, I have never been a fan of Nvidia products, including desktop chip sets that have burned out on me, their first mobile offering in the Asus tablet which I owned, and now this one. Frequently, chrome freezes for periods of time while browsing, and I blame slow responsiveness at times on the Nvidia dual core CPU in this table. I have always noticed better performance in Qualcomm based systems, and this Nvidia dual core system is no different. I would happily trade if for the newest Qualcomm quad core which I have in the blazing responsive Droid Turbo phone.\n2. Memory: Google goes for 64 Gb in their new phone, but opts to only put 32 Gb in the tablet. Go figure. This another sign that many design decisions were punted down the road or left to HTC. Good luck putting many movies on this system to have while traveling.\n3. Buttons and Power On: The power button is awful, horrible, cheap, junk. Double tap to turn on does not always respond or respond quickly, and sometimes I am force to hunt for the tiny side mounted power button which barely protrudes from the casing and is difficult to use at best. Also, one needs to find it sometimes to turn off the display, when double tap will not help. The volume buttons are equally bad, difficult to access, and clunky.\n4. Price: Overall, one is paying too much for basically a pair of speakers and $10 worth of memory. Nothing else stands out about this tablet, and some things are actually quite frustrating. It is far over priced for what is offered."}

Once I got the device I was very disappointed with the build quality because I felt it was the exact same with just metal bands around it. The front firing speakers aren't the same as HTC's previous phones but they are better than any IPad or IPhone speaker. Another reason I wanted this device was because  of stock Andriod and updates coming to my device before everyone else. The volume and power button are a little difficult to press but that isn't that big to me. And on the back of the device you can touch the plastic and feel a little separation between it and the stuff inside of it. If it drops to a $300 point I would definitely recommend taking it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "The quality inconsistency of the LCD screen is real. My unit has a very noticeable bleed from the bottom left corner in portrait orientation. It's not noticeable when using the tablet thanks to the wonderfully colorful Lollipop OS but when watching movies, it's there. Especially because this is a 4:3 screen not a 16:9, so when you're watching movies there are black bands on the bottom and top of the screen.\n\nApart from that:\n-the battery seems to hold a charge nicely,\n-the camera is adequate for a tablet (please don't use tablets for photography people),\n-the OS is buttery smooth, I love Lollipop on my Nexus 5 and this tablet is not an exception, it's very very very good,\n-the multi touch works very good, I tested 5 fingers and moved them around there were no hiccups,\n-the back of the tablet doesn't flex in my unit, even if it did I wouldn't care\n-it gets slightly warm in normal use which is fine, I haven't stress-tested it with a 3D game though,\n-the metal band around the tablet feels nice\n-some people didn't like the power and volume buttons but I really like them, they are easily found and good movement\n-I got the white version and the back isn't too slippery, it doesn't show fingerprints or anything like that, I have a white Nexus 5 which is made of the same back material and I don't use a case for it and it's endured in my jeans etc. for a whole year and it hasn't stained at all, do not worry about the white version staining,\n-there's a 250MB update immediately after you turn on the device before you even enter Google credentials and it takes roughly 1520 minutes to setup completely.\n-the speakers are LOUD, I mean really LOUD, they made me jump in bed when I played a YouTube video the first time and it wasn't even at full volume.\n\nI bought it for my mom and I hope she'll like it just as much.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I wanted to love this tablet so much. I owned both the Nexus 4 and 5, and had access to a Nexus 7. I felt that it was finally time to buy myself a tablet, and because I had such a great experience with previous Nexus devices, the Nexus 9 seemed to be the logical choice. The larger screen, better specs, and more sophisticated build quality seemed to be worth the price hike that I wasn't too keen on in the beginning.\n\nI've owned the 9 for nearly three weeks now. I was initially surprised by the size. The two inch difference from the 7 is quite big, and for me, the larger size was a bit overwhelming. I knew it was going to be bigger, but haven't been able to see the device in person before purchasing, I didn't know it was going to be gigantic compared to the 7. However, since I was so excited to own another Nexus device, I was willing to look past this.\n\nDuring the initial setup (connecting to wifi and logging into my google account before even syncing), I noticed that the tablet got really hot around the camera. I wasn't too happy about this since it had been on for less than 15 minutes at this point. I'm guessing the larger screen uses up a lot of energy? When I stream music through Google All Access, the device stays cool when the screen is blacked out.\n\nThe front-facing speakers were a huge draw for me before purchasing. Unfortunately, they left me a bit disappointed. The 7 had more of a crisper surround-sound quality. The 9's speakers aren't terrible, but I felt that the two year old 7's were better (not to mention cheaper). Perhaps they aren't broken in yet, but after three weeks of listening to music/streaming TV shows, all I can say is that I'm not impressed. Also, due to placement of the speakers, I can only awkwardly hold the tablet when using it horizontally. Since the tablet is quite heavy, it ends up straining my wrist.\n\nThe power and volume buttons are oddly inaccessible. They are too low profile, so I really have to fish around to feel for and push the buttons. After three weeks of daily use, I can say that this ended up really pushing my buttons.\n\nI would've kept the Nexus 9 even with the above mentioned issues. The problems aren't as egregious as they may seem on paper, and I was willing to be okay with spending $500+ for mild satisfaction, but it has restarted on me 5 times now! I'm not sure if I received a faulty device, but having it restart for no reason can be frustrating. I don't think I do anything too strenuous; I either listen to music, browse, stream shows, or play Clash of Clans. I do these things plus more on my Nexus 5 phone with no issues.\n\nRelative to other tablets, the Nexus 9 may be on the upper end of the price spectrum. At this price point ($480+tax+CA recycling fee) I feel that I should actually be happy with my purchase. And it certainly should not spontaneously restart. I do feel sad that I decided to return the device. I googled nearly everyday for a month before its release for an actual release date and ordered it on day one of its release! I instantly became attached, but sometimes things just aren't meant to be. Hopefully Nvidia's Shield will be a worthy successor."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I love my nexus 9. It is blazing fast and extremely powerful.  My only complaints would be the show charging times and some apps are not optimized on android for either 64 bit or just not compatible with lollipop.\n\nUpdate:\n\nAfter spending a couple of days with the tablet, I still love it. The tablet feels solid, but lacks a high end premium feel an ipad has. Despite this, the nexus 9 still feels great and in no way feels cheap. The dual front facing speakers are the best i have geard on a tablet . the screeen looks good but cant touch the quad HD amoled screens on devices like the nexus 6 or galaxy note 4. It seems like lollipop was made for amoled screens with its bright colors and contrast through material design.\n\nLollipop is great operating system but not without it's hitches. Some apps are not optimized yet for the operating system and can freeze OE not open properly. Everything within the operatin system works almost flawlessly. I say almost because, besides what I mentioned above , the adaptive brightness seems to be inconsistent.  I'm sure this is a software issue and I hope HTC and Google fix this . its a minor issue but still annoying. Battery seems to last me a full 24 hours with heavy use which is good. The nvidia tetra k1 64but chip and the 64 bit os is extremely fast. I have never seen such fast performance on games and navigating between menus. The 9 inch form factor is great , if not reminiscent of an ipad . especially with the 4:3 aspect ratio. That's not a bad thing, but it does make typing with both thumbs more diffuclt as the tablet is wider. Videos now have bars on the top and bottom when in landscape mode due to the new aspect ratio making the screen smaller than it is. However the tablet seems more usable in both landscape and when held upright than 16:9 tablets that most android tablets use. Overall this is the best android tablet I've used. With a few software updates to fix some bug it can be nearly flawless.\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nI had to return my tablet.  After spending more time with the tablet and using it in a darker environment and watching a movie on the nexus 9, I found some screen bleed.  I ended up returning the tablet and getting a new unit free from Amazon.  Problem is my new unit was even worse.  Screen bleeding was terrible along the entire edge of the LCD screen.  The buttons were flush and hard to push.  Finally when I pushed on the back of the tablet, around the nexus logo, I noticed the back of the tablet pushed in.  After looking online I found many people are having these issues. It seems to be a problem with the way the tablet is manufactured.  This is HTC's reintroduction into the tablet market and they are dropping the ball and considering how well build the HTC one M8 is build I am a bit surprised.  the Nexus 6 doesn't seem to be suffering from Rampant issues like the Nexus 9 is, so I would assume the blame should predominately be placed on HTC for poor build quality and a poor manufacturing process. From a software perspective, Lollipop has some issues still but they are being handled by Google and it is a solid operating system that looks and runs great overall.\n\n Some have reported better units on Reddit but it seems inconsistent as to who gets them.  Until these issues are resolved I am going to hold off on buying a new unit."}

I turned on the unit and prepared myself for Android goodness. Now mind you, I have read many reviews and was torn on some of the comments but I gave in and made the purchase. While waiting for the unit to load up, I noticed the first thing that so many people have mentioned. I brought the Nexus 9 in white and while it looks great you can actually press on the logo on the back and it actually goes in and makes a sucking sound. I've never had a tablet do that and I've had many like the Samsung Tab S, Nexus 10 which I still own, a Nexus 7 and a Samsung note 4 phone. The next thing that caught my eye was the large amount of light bleeding around the edges of the screen, it was horrendous. My disappointment was starting to bloom. The icing on the cake was when I loaded my Google information into the tablet and downloaded my apps. I started up Dead Trigger 2 and by the second level the top of the tablet near the camera was very hot. Before the third level could start the tablet froze. I had to do a hard reset and the tablet froze again. I did another hard reset and this time I was able to get back in but when I started to play Plants Vs Zombies 2, it froze again. I did a full reset and once again entered my credential and was back into the OS when it froze again. I gave up in disgust, printed a return label and just dropped it off at UPS. I was shocked that the numerous negative reviews were correct. I can't believe that HTC would produce a tablet with such low quality and with heat issues. I think I'll just keep using my Nexus 10 and buy an Ipad Air 2."}

Unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my expectations especially at $400. I love the 4:3 form factor as that extra width in portrait mode really works wonders when reading anything on the screen particularly websites. Lollipop is also great step forward for Android with lots of little changes and tweaks. The stereo speakers are also quite decent but don't expect booming bass from them!\n\nI ended up returning this for the following reasons:\n* For such powerful hardware, the performance is perplexing. It will blaze through 3D benchmarks but will randomly struggle (lagging for several seconds) to e.g, open a new browser tab or bring up the app switcher. This isn't from any apps that I've installed either as a newly reset device with no extra apps installed will exhibit this behavior. My android phone has never had these sorts of lag issues\n* Gets really hot during use (even just web browsing)\n* Battery life is average at best\n* There was light bleed from the top and left edges of the screen on mine (when held in portrait)\n* Some creek in the case especially around where the HTC logo is on the back\n\nOn the subject of the performance issues, I am beginning to think it is directly attributable to the NVidia chipsets and/or drivers. I've owned a Tegra 3 tablet (Asus TF201), Tegra 4 tablet (Asus TF701), and Tegra K1 (NVidia shield tablet). They've all exhibited the same random stuttering and lag. The Tegra K1 chipset is also notorious for running really hot so I don't think this is something they can fix with a software tweak (look at the NVidia shield forums). By comparison, my XPeria Z2 phone with its Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset breezes through day to day activities with ease. It may not win raw performance/game benchmarks but it just feels faster, smoother and so much more consistent."}

I am always skeptical about Nvidia processor for a reason, they are really poor in supporting and opening source to the third party developers. Since, Google is working with Nvidia, I don't have to worry about software. That said, definitely going to miss custom roms. Lollipop looks good, completely overhaul from Kitkat. Let me tell you one thing, the software that comes with tablets, doesn't feel like a finish product. Google just released OTA Build Number LRX21R makes the tablet performance better and smooth. Not that the installed version was bad, but it had few issues. Now a days, no matter whether its Google or Apple or Amazon, their software that ships with is always 75-80% baked, and they fixed as the customer finds bugs.  The new update takes this tablet performance to whole new level. There is still room for improvement. Usually, i don't care about camera on tablet, but when Google and HTC decide to include one, they need to work on it a bit better. The picture quality is decent, but i wanted something more out of it. The screen on the tablet is amazing, i love it. This device is meant for media, speakers are as usual, amazing!! HTC stands out in speakers performance, no doubt totally blows the competition.\n\nPrice: The price of this tablet is bit too much. I believe if Google priced this one for $250-300 this would have been most selling tablet this season.\n\nBuild quality: Some people had issues with build quality, I was lucky one to receive with no defects. I still have to see any defects on mine.\n\nI will update this review in couple of months and see how this tablet holds up. As for now, with the new update this tablet is worth the buy."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I bought one of these at Best Buy at midnight the day it came out (they were doing a midnight sale of some game).  The screen had multiple light leaks, the top of the tablet got incredibly hot and the battery life was so-so, even with barely any apps running.  Browsing the web heated the device up quite a bit for no reason.  I returned and waited on the one I ordered from Google Play to arrive (yes, I ordered two because I figured one was going to have a hardware issue).  The second tablet had even worse light leaks on the edge of the easily bendable screen, the back flexed and popped, and the battery and heat issues were in this one as well.  You could bend this tablet so easily it was alarming.  I returned it for an iPad Air 2, which had zero issues.\n\nI am a huge Android fan and always have Nexus phones.  I waited a year for this tablet and paid a hefty price for it.  In my opinion, it is not worth the premium price.  There are too many issues."}

The clean interface with no junkware is worth the premium to me. I also enjoy some Apple product from time to time. This is the closest thing you can get to a perfectly clean tablet.\n\nThat being said, I was not pleased with this tablet. It wasn't build quality. It wasn't the buttons. I like the screen size & shape. It was the overall package that I wasn't pleased with. Too heavy. Too thick. Runs too hot. The screen is a little blasty, bleachy, or bright hazey. You could see pixels... not that much, but enough that it felt lower quality than my last tablet. The previous Nexus 10 had a better screen.\n\nIs this a bad tablet? No. It wasn't bad. But for the price, I expect more.\n\nLollipop was pleasing, and felt both WebOSish and Sony PlayStation at the same time. Square, circle, back arrow navigation? So PS3. The shapes and flatness felt very WebOS. I can live with this!\n\nIn summary, I scraped my pennies up for a Premium Nexus device but the OS was the only thing premium. The rest felt like last year's technology, or before.  And I otherwise normally love HTC compared to other manufacturers."}

There was some light bleed when you are in a dark room with a dark picture (like the start up Google logo). Honestly, if Google had a start up screen that wasn't black, I don't think anyone would have noticed. There is the clicking sound of adhesive by the camera lens, but that is survivable and not noticeable in normal use. The tablet does run hot on the upper middle section when using. Mine started heating up when I was syncing my Google account and doing about 80 downloads at the same time.\n\nPros of initial reaction...\nLollipop is smooth for the apps it currently runs with. Gotta wait on the developers now to get their updates rolling through. The display is great! It doesn't seem to matter to me whether its 4:3 or 16:9, but the display is very sharp. The sound quality is very nice. Those HTC speakers keep their reputation in tact. Once Google updates Android L to fix all the battery issues and such, it will be a fantastic tablet.

The Nexus 9 I received did not have the quality control issues that are going around on the Web. No bleeding light, squishy back or performance issues. So maybe HTC/Google started to fix them? I had the nexus 7 2012 and 2013 and the Nexus 9 is a great upgrade if you can fork over the bills. The size is perfect and easy to handle.  I think the screen quality is great and the speakers are awesome for a tablet. Overall, the tablet offers good user experience that is fluid, fast and enjoyable. The reason I didn't give it a 5 star because the 4:3 ratio and battery life is decent but not great. I hope app developers adjust for the screen ratio. Some apps just cant open or look really bad (big and stretched out). So if you can fork over the 400 dollars (300-350 dollars would have been better) and go through a little growing pains (Ive already had 2 software updates from google), I recommended this tablet to anyone; especially diehard android fans like me."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "By far the best tablet I have owned. Is it perfect? No, but nothing should be perfect - where else would we improve?\n\nFor an Android tablet it is nice to have the 4:3 aspect ratio iOS users have enjoyed on their tablets. It makes sense for what I use my tablet for - reading, web surfing, occasional gaming, and email. It is a bummer to have the black lines above and below video though that any 4:3 device would have. I have quickly become used to it though.\n\nPros:\n- Gorgeous screen: Very high resolution, very bright and spot on colors. These are not over-saturated like you will see on Samsung devices. These colors are more true to life. Also, the viewing angles are great.\n- Light - Overall, I find this to be a light tablet. It's not as light as the Nexus 7 or the iPad Mini but those are smaller devices. Perfectly comfortable in my hands\n- Android 5.0 Lollipop - You just need to use it to get a feel for how good this version of Android is\n- Double Tap to Wake - This is a fantastic feature that should be on all devices. Just tap the screen to wake it up\n- Responsive - This is a fast, fast tablet that is incredibly responsive. Considering I am still running the first \"shipping\" version of Android 5.0 the snappiness of this device is impressive. Once Google has pushed out 1 or 2 updates (likely to be done by the time you read this), I expect nothing but butter\n- The black version has a soft touch back - so, so nice to hold\n- Front facing speakers. Why don't all OEMs do this? It just makes so much sense.\n\nCons\n- Power and Volume buttons are hard to find - not enough travel in them\n- Lack of accessories at launch - really want the Magic Cover but alas...no luck until December\n- No wireless charging. I have been spoiled on my Nexus 5 with wireless charging. Plugging in is just a pain (first world problem, I know)\n- A bit pricey but this tablet is as future proof as tech can be these days.\n\nOther thoughts\n- This is the first 64bit Nexus will likely see solid updates for a few versions of Android unlike iOS which just handicaps new versions for older devices or OEMs like Samsung just dropping support all together\n- Light bleed. I do not have this issue - definitely a quality control issue from HTC however it seems it was likely focused to early production run devices\n- I also don't have issues with excessive travel on the back cover. According to those in the know, the back is supposed to be a bit hallow in the center and have a little give. Mine is just fine. Chalk this up again to I got a lucky one from the early production runs\n\nWould I buy it again?\n- Without a doubt.\n\nAlso, I did not buy it from Amazon. I pre-ordered from Amazon but then received a notice they could not guarantee delivery so I cancelled it and bought from Best Buy instead. It hurt to spend my money at Best Buy but I was forced to."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "This is my second N9. The first one I received had pretty bad backlight bleeding so i rolled the dice and exchanged it for a new one. I've had this tablet for about 1 week now. I use it everyday so here are my thoughts and concerns.\n\nFirst off, 2 issues:\nLED Backlight bleed - this second unit had a lot less backlight bleed than the first. There is just a tiny bit in the top left side if you hold the tablet in landscape orientation with the camera on the left. I'm not saying that this is acceptable but backlight bleeding is a common issue with LED screens. It's not enough to bother me but I'm still on the fence about returning this unit and waiting for Google/HTC to release a v2 or just wait for the next batch. Got a couple weeks left to send this back to Amazon.\n\nHeat - I also experience the warm spot right near/under the camera but that's probably where the CPU and GPU are located so yes, typically those spots will get pretty warm. It's not crazy hot though where it will warp or wear the plastic backing. I had the tablet running for 5 hours the other day and it never got uncomfortably hot. I think my phone gets more hot and more uncomfortable than the tablet. As I feel this is an issue, I'm hoping that with some software updates they can improve this (if that is possible)\n\nThings I like:\nLollipop - it's smooth, it's great, it's a huge upgrade from Kit Kat. I love the card system. It makes multitasking so much easier. I also like how the UI looks flatter and more simple. Just makes everything a bit more clean looking. Also nice to be able to get updates right away with no bloatware and extra crap that's not needed.\n\nDesign - I like the simple design. The tablet feels great in my hands, it's not too heavy, the design looks sophisticated while not being flashy (like the Samsung Tab S with it's gold rim). I appreciate the buttons being capacitive rather than physical buttons. That way the home button is always between my hands (keeps it out of the way when I play games in landscape)\n\nSpeakers - I know people expected more out of the HTC Boom sound but I actually think they do pretty well for speakers on a mobile device. It's a lot better than any other ones that have speakers on the back or bottom where when you lay it down it sounds muffled. With this, I can actually have some decent sound when listening to Pandora while I cook in the kitchen. Also, when watching a movie, it's nice having the sound in stereo pointing at me rather than to the sides or the back.\n\nEverything else about the tablet is meh. Camera, never expected too much out of it. Display, it's nice but it's not breathtaking like Samsung's AMOLED (which is just super saturated). Battery life is pretty good but I don't think it's what they listed on their spec sheet.\n\nOverall, I think the tablet handles well. If you want a pure Android experience, this is the tablet to get. Form factor is about perfect and I prefer a 4:3 ratio for the display. I don't mind the black bars while watching a movie or Netflix, I actually like it since the controls are in the black area.\n\nNow, like all the other people, I'm still debating about returning this device (hence the 3 stars) and waiting or testing my luck again for a non defective unit. Any advice would be great."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "What a sweet tablet - I've used it for reading, gaming, music, videos, you name it. A couple negatives I've read on tech sites include build quality, screen ratio, and glare. Build quality is top notch in my opinion, and handsome. I have an HTC One M8, and yeah it's more solid because it's all aluminum. The 9 would weigh 3 pounds it it was all metal. Seems like Lollipop, which rocks, was built for the 4:3 ratio and I'm happy about that. The widescreen format was cumbersome in tablets over 7 inches, and hopefully other  manufacturers follow this format. Finally, screen glare. I find that to be such a ridiculous criticism. So, every tablet made until the iPad Air 2 had roughly equal glare. Never a problem. So, because the Air 2 has an anti-glare coating, every singe tablet review from here will knock glare? Or just this one because it's Android's front runner? it's no different than any other tablet with respect to glare unless you're used to the Air 2. Doesn't bother me one bit and for >$100 less than iPad Air 2 (not that price should be you factor between those two, should be OS).\n\nGreat tablet. Worth every penny.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Okay, I, like everyone else, have seen and read many reviews of the Nexus 9 since it came out. I really wanted one due to the new software and I was intrigued by the form factor. However, my excitement was dimmed somewhat by the less than stellar reviews and the price tag to be honest. I wanted the 32gb but settled for 16gb due to the price and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. As a point of reference, I have owned several iPads, the Nexus 7 2013, the Nexus 10, the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 and 12.2 (Good grief, I've owned and traded away way too many tablets. No wonder my wife makes those faces, sheesh!).\n\nI traded in my Galaxy tab pro 8.4 for the Nexus 9 but kept the tab pro 12.2. I ordered it from Amazon and have avoided the big hardware issues that many have spoken about. The back feels solid and there is minimal, if any, light bleed. The transitions are snappy and fluid, the colors are great, the sound is fine (I didn't realize so many relied on the speakers anyway; I use headphones mostly), and the form factor surprised me. I'll be glad when some of the apps I like are updated for Lollipop but that's not the tablet's fault so I can be patient (I bought a LG G3 and waited a long time for some of the apps to become compatible. the 9 is already better at that than the phone was). The tablet is easy to hold and great to read on. The screen is bright enough for me turned up only half way (again better than my G3) and the images and video look great. I don't mind the letterboxing of videos. The way I looke at that is if I want a bigger picture, I should by a bigger sized tablet. The quality is great and realistic looking to my eyes.\n\nTo me, the bottom is buy the tablet based on what you like and what you need. I would encourage anyone to find a store that has one on display to see what you think before you buy. I do wish it would have been priced lower (but don't we wish that about everything we buy these days) and the battery life could be better (couldn't they have put a bigger battery in it for the same price). With all that being said, I am very happy with the tablet. Apps run smoothly, images and videos and crisp and sharp, text is wonderful and easy to read, colors are great, and I don't find it difficult to hold at all. I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone who is considering buying it. If you are concerned about possible hardware issues, make sure you know the return policy at the location you buy it.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "This is a preliminary review. I chose to be an early adopter (something I normally avoid like the plague), due to serious dissatisfaction with my iPad, and a pressing need for something that works the way I need it to. I initially bought the iPad - a couple of years ago - to use as a photo album, but now also want something to use for note taking and creating documents. I am a serious amateur photographer, who recognized the virtues of a tablet computer in this size range, with top screen quality, as an ideal electronic photo album. And at the time the iPad's screen quality was clearly superior to the competition. Just about everything else about the iPad, however, I dislike. The need to use iTunes to \"sync\" photos or music files with your computer on which they reside is a horror. I live in more than one place, have more than one computer, and wish to be able to simply copy any type of file to my tablet from wherever I happen to be without needing to sync it to anything. And that includes \"the cloud,\" which only the foolish will consider to be secure.\nSo far I find the Nexus 9 to be an improvement in most ways. It's truly liberating to be able to simply and quickly copy my music files, photos, videos, made from a webcam in the mountains of Arizona, (and played perfectly with VCL media player for Android). Overall this tablet is faster and more responsive than my iPad. The video quality is excellent, though with a slightly different color cast. The ability to customize is very much to my liking. It complements my moto x well. And I find it very easy to type with, and to be much more responsive in this regard than my iPad, leading me to doubt whether a keyboard folio would be that much of a benefit. Sound quality via the speakers is also much better that my iPad.\nIt's not perfect though. Being released with no cases available, is very poor practice. Battery life in my sample appears to be much less than my older iPad. Some programs occasionally freeze, which presumably will be corrected with software updates - something that google is usually good about. The biggest weakness for me, however, has to do with viewing photos, of all things. The Nexus 9 has a 4:3 aspect ratio like the iPad. And when I use one of my photos as the desktop background it fully fills the available screen space. Not so when you view photos in albums. In the iPad when you open a photo it appears first with tool bars in place. A single tap and they all disappear and you view the photo filling the entire screen. You can then scroll through your photos, with each filling the screen fully. With the Nexus 9, when you open a photo it too opens with tool bars to the sides and bottom. A single tap in this case, removes the side bars, but not the bottom one. This causes the photo to resize at less than full screen size, with black bars on either side. I can see no good reason for this and it certainly is a step down. Hopefully this can be overcome in the future.\nI don't have any of the screen issues reported by others. So I am giving it 5 stars (4.5,if I could, considering the less than stellar battery life) for now, in the hope that the issues I have noted will be fixed. So I will update this review in the future.\nUpdate: 11/27/14 I dropped the rating 1 star after having time to assess just how poor the battery life is. 68 minutes on the internet = 25% battery."}

Apple wins in aesthetic design, but Android beats it in every way when it comes to operating system and functionality.\n\nNow for the bad...\n\n1. This wasn't the nail in the coffin for me, but screen bleed was apparent and pretty major. It should not be this bad on an expensive device like this. I was willing to overlook it, until the other poor craftsmanship issues arose.\n\n2. CPU heat. Though the temp really isn't that bad for a CPU, it is bad relative to where they placed it on the device in relation to human fingers as well as the material they used on the back. The CPU reached 50 degrees Celsius (122f) which I have other tablets that run hotter at times. The problem is, the chip sits too close to the back plate and radiates all that heat right to your hand and the backing... Which leads to number 3.\n\n3. materials. The backplate is made of a thin plastic that, when coupled with the CPU heat, started to warp and deform.\n\nAs wonderful as the size and OS was, I couldn't stand for the horrific hardware that HTC put out. Shame on them. Too much should be at stake for a company fighting to be relevant in a space its had too much trouble in in the past. Its so bad, that I'm inclined to say I'd never buy another HTC product. ( Im also one of the few not impressed with their One/M series of phones)"}

I was looking for a tablet that is a little larger than the Nexus 7 and a tablet that I could easily carry with me while traveling without having to worry about if I could fit it securely in my carry-on bag.\nAndroid Lollipop is a beautiful platform. Google really got it right with the push for Material Design to unify the look of the UI across all applications.\nI now use this tablet every day. I've found that I look forward to writing email, because it's just cleaner looking on my tablet than it is on a Windows laptop with the Gmail web application open.\nIt really has been an awesome experience so far and I'm happy with my purchase.\nHope this helps you!"}

I knew that the build quality has been reviewed as \"horrible\" and the battery life \"sucks\". But if you just give the tablet some leeway, then I truly believe you will be happy if you get one.\n\nI waited for about 6 months before the nexus 9 was released and I really considered getting an iPad mini, but I'm glad I waited. Getting a Nexus makes you an early adopter, and because I've had a few devices right when they come out, I understand that software can really, really make a difference. So I think everyone reviewing the tablet and giving it such bad reviews on battery life and things that can be fixed with updates, is reviewing it too soon. There are lags and the battery life on standby isn't amazing.\n\nIf you trust google to take care of the small things wrong with this tablet, I really think you will be happy. I know I am"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I bought this to replace a Nexus 10 plagued by spontaneous seizures and reboots.  I wanted something stable, a little lighter, faster, with more storage and the promise of prompt Android updates.  Outside of the increased stability I'm not sure I'm ahead by purchasing the Nexus 9.\n\nStarting with the good parts:\n * The screen is beautiful.  It really surprises me how nice photos and graphics look on the Nexus 9.\n * It can be fast.  Despite stutters, lags and slow transitions, most apps will move quickly and fluidly.  I have not tried CPU/GPU-  intensive games, but I hear they show best on this tablet.\n * It is lighter than the Nexus 10, and smaller in just about every dimension.\n * It has been very stable.  A huge relief after wrestling with the Nexus 10 for the last several months.\n\nSome of the widely reported flaws have missed me, and others I don't care about:\n * My unit shows no light bleed.  Lucky, I guess.\n * My unit has the flappy back - the back panel flexes a lot when you press it in the middle.  This doesn't bother me at all, and the rest of the tablet seems solidly built.\n * The power and volume buttons are too small, and located too close together.  Who cares?  Not a big deal.\n\nBut there have been disappointments, too:\n * Yes, it is lighter than the Nexus 10, but not enough to be comfortable holding it one-handed.  The device feels very heavy for its size, and I feel like I've given up screen size without being able to change the way I use the device.\n * The thing stutters and freezes, and certain transitions (between apps, when opening apps) are so slow that you'd swear you're on some sub-$100 device.  It's only a big deal if Google can't fix this with OS updates, and I'm pretty sure they will.\n * It goes through battery more quickly than expected, even for web browsing, and then it charges pretty slowly (not as slowly as the Nexus 10, but still slowly even with a 3-amp charger).\n * My unit has a tough time recognizing finger touches.  It's worse in the 3 o'clock to 5 o'clock area of the screen, but also at 6 o'clock, so waking the device can take several tries.  This is not a deal killer, but at this point the annoyances are starting to add up, especially when you spent $500 for it.\n\nYou may have read about how great the speakers are, or if you read one review, how terrible they are.  They're not great, and they're not terrible.  They're better than a single speaker at the bottom of another Nexus tablet, but they won't transform your tablet experience.\n\nLollipop Android is fine.  Some cool features (especially how setting up a new Android device is much faster and easier than before - nice work Google), but it won't transform your Android experience.\n\nThe lack of expandable storage is a pain (especially since I learned that Lollipop is restoring the MicrosSD storage options that KitKat destroyed), but at least I knew about it before purchasing the Nexus 9.\n\nAnd the fact that Google once again doesn't have good cases available at launch is just ridiculous, and makes Samsung, Apple - just about any competitor - better.\n\nI will be interested to see how Google improves it over the coming months.  I'm enough of a Nexus fan that I don't regret the 'upgrade', but if it stays the way it is I'll wish I'd gotten something from Samsung.\n\nUpdate: After traveling with this thing for a few weeks it's headed for eBay.  It's unpleasant to hold, the battery life is only mediocre and there are too many hitches and pauses while opening or transitioning apps.  A $266 Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 10.1 doesn't have as good a screen, but it's faster, expandable, lasts longer, more pleasant to hold, and more pleasant for getting work done."}

I had the mushy back and when you touched the back it made a sound like the plastic back was trying to stick to the adhesive but failed. This made me nervous but I decided I could deal with that. What made me decide to return it was when I noticed 2 of my four corners of the plastic back was pulling away from the tablet. This indicted shoddy manufacturing. After seeing all the other reviews I opted to refund instead of exchange. I own both the 2012 and 2013 nexus 7 and my last three phones where htc (the thunderbolt, dna and currently m8). I had high hopes for this product. I love android. I am extremely disappoint in this tablet. I realize that lollipop is in its early stages but my tablet was sluggish. I pulled out my nexus 7 2013 to compare speed. Everything opened quickly and stutter free on the nexus 7 2013 but about 70% of the time there was a delay from 2 to as long as 8 seconds for opening apps on the nexus 9. When switching screens I also would either get a delay or where the icons/widgets would need to redraw. I also had a problem attempting to perform a factory reset. It took me 8 tries before the tablet successfully performed a factory reset. I am going back to my nexus 7 2013 (and this is despite the fact that my nexus 7 2013 has the random reboot issue) and wait until something better comes along. I prefer the pure vanilla android experience vs a tablet with a altered android overlay. My recommendation is to steer clear of this tablet."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I really wanted to like this product. I have held off purchasing a tablet for the entire year waiting for the next Nexus device. As soon as it was announced I pre-ordered on Amazon, waited patiently until it was released. And now that I have been able to use it for about a week, I can say it is a very decent tablet. It comes with the latest version of Android and and for the most part works well.\n\nPlease do not believe the hype that the new CPU (Nvidia K1) is some type of next-gen processor that gives you desktop level performance on a tablet. For gaming it is above average, but for web browsing its a hit or a miss. Some websites load quickly, but some have a hard time loading, and there is also the occasional lag or crash.  Additionally the the device feels cheap due to the flimsy plastic back. And what is up with only 16 GB for the base model? Since there is a significant mark-up from the previous Nexus 7, Google/HTC should have at least given us 32 GB. That's a blatant disregard for consumers.\n\nI am more than willing to overlook some of the shortcomings, but only if it was priced accordingly. This is in no way a $400 device (16gb/wifi), not even close. I would have given it 5 stars if it was priced at $300, 4 stars if priced at $350."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Here's my take on the Nexus 9. First off been on the Nexus products for years. Every one of the products had something wrong when it launched. I remember back when the Nexus 7 2013 model launched. Screens of death, reboots, problems with wifi. I don't recall what the first generation Nexus 7 was like. On to the Nexus 9. I personally like this device and I do not recommend products like this for others because what I find acceptable you may look at and say \"no way\". I have the white 16gb model though and I have not seen the flex in the back and my unit has no physical defects or I would have sent it back immediately. But its not finished at a software level. Be aware of what you are buying here. You are buying a release of a hardware product with a major revision of android on it. This is not some minor version bump number you are getting. There will be hard edges around the software just like some have found with the hardware. That being said, I enjoy the prospect because in each case that I have bought Nexus gear I have waited for things like kernels, AOSP ROMs, other things which sharpen the product, make it better.\n\nif you go into this and spend the money expect rough edges and be prepared to track issues, apply new patches, perhaps unlock the bootloader and root the thing. For each of the Nexus phones or tablets I have owned, they have always required the same. If you get faulty hardware, return it for RMA ASAP. If you expect something finished and all dolled up, this is not the product for you. If you want to get your hands dirty, enjoy a challenge, like to flash things, want to contribute and collaborate in a development environment, the Nexus 9 may be a heck of a lot of fun as the kernel and ROM developers figure things out.\n\nMy take on the Lollipop experience is that its a radically different thing and we are only at 5.0 at this point. It will take iterations to get past the things like random reboots, heating due to software, etc. I see those things now every so often. I think chrome is one of the culprits to overheating because if you push the tablet hard with chrome it gets warm. I don't play lots of games but I like a good Netflix or Hulu endeavor and I'm satisfied with these things.\n\nSo in the end, my recommendation is I don't have one. I gave it 4 stars because its ambitious, its fun, its funky, its not done. I think Lollipop is a new step in a new direction and this tablet and the Nexus 6 showcase it. If you join up, welcome to XDA. Hope you enjoy your stay there :-)"}

This time I selected the new device without recovering from any backups of my other devices.\n\nThis time I am happy and this tablet works great. WiFi is excellent and fast, battery now does not get hot. Before the factory reset, I was even having a problem sometimes when selecting an icon that would bring up the Google Play Store, even though it was Firefox or Calculator, etc. After doing the hard reset and reloading all my apps from the Play Store everything is working flawlessly.\n\nIf you too initially tried to restore from another backup of an android device, try completely starting over again and reinstall each app from the Play Store."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I've been a long time Nexus brand user, owning the Nexus 4/5/7. I sold my iPad 3 but still retain my iPod Touch 4th Generation as dedicated mp3 player. Furthermore, I employ a Dell Venue 8 Pro running Windows 8.1 as a productivity tablet. Please see my profile for my Nexus 5 and 7 reviews. This review is meant for both the technical savvy and the casual user so bear with me as at times I'll veer headfirst into alphabet number soup talk and at times keep it real simple.  I also purchased my Nexus 9 directly from Google Play.\n\nIf you're the super lazy kind of person, skip to section (11): TLDR, otherwise let's begin:\n\n(1) Hardware:\n\nPersonally, in my opinion, high to medium end devices from reputable brands have reached the point where most people won't be able to tell the difference or the difference won't be something they regularly use. That said I'm still going to cover it. If you're not interested in the nerd talk about hardware, then all you need to know is that the tablet is capable hardware wise for demanding users and absurdly overkill for average users. Skip this section of my review and head on down to section (2): Performance.\n\nBehold, the dual core Denver Tegra K-1, the first official 64bit Android ARM chip on a 64bit ARM operating system running the new v8 instruction set. Now, you're thinking, what's so special about 64 bit and what's so good about the v8 instruction set? Well, that's in section (5).  Anyways, the K-1 is a dual core clocking in at 2.5 GHz. It's also paired with a 192-core GPU. Honestly, this to most people is just alphabet soup. I have little but disdain for mobile benchmarks given their inherent problems relating to real world tests, but they do show the K-1 performing exceptionally well.\n\nThe tablet comes with 2GB of DDR3 RAM made by Micron Technology, which is kind of disappointing given that Android phones like the Note 4 are clocking in at 3 GB of RAM. Given how the Nexus 9 is a true 64 bit tablet, this is a bit troublesome, see section (5).\n\nAs usual, comes with a 3.5 mm audio jack, NFC, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1 and GPS, the last three features provided by a Broadcom chip. The 3.5mm standard audio jack is located on the top. Wi-Fi is upgraded to the industry standard of 802.11ac 2x2 which is also known as MiMO, also referred to as \"dual band\" which allows for much faster in theory Wi-Fi connections. USB is legacy 2.0 rather than 3.0. There's also an electric compass made by Ashai Kasei. Sound is provided by two front face speakers with HTC's BoomSound. See section (2) for more on the speakers. The tablet also stocks dual microphones. Microphone is decent as I was able to operate the voice commands in a quiet room from 7 feet away with a normal voice level. Sorry kids, there isn't any finger print sensor on this tablet.\n\nThe display is sized at IPS 8.9\" at a 2048x1536 resolution, for a PPI of 281. Sadly, this isn't my Nexus 5's PPI. Google and HTC went for the 4:3 aspect ratio rather than the usual 16:10/16:9 which are both better for movie watching. There are black bars when I loaded up movies. Take that as you will. The screen is the standard Gorilla Glass 3, meaning it's tough but clear. Sorry kids, no sapphire. The tablet runs really bright at the highest level, but I run my around 35-40% and it's still acceptably bright. Viewing angles are solid and you won't have a problem viewing content from odd angles.\n\nAt the moment the notification LED on the screen does not function like the Nexus 5 one does, meaning you cannot assign colors to different applications and people.  The developers of the app \"Lightflow\" are allegedly working on making their app compatible.\n\nThe device is just under a pound at 0.936 pounds, so pretty light. The dimensions of the device are 6.05 inches by 8.9 inches by 0.312 inches. I can see these tablets are on super model diets. That can't be enjoyable. Someone get my tablet a double bacon cheeseburger stat! Anyways, you won't get tired holding this thing and if you do, hit the gym.\n\nYour color options are a bit expanded over the Nexus 7, with black, white and sand. Google names these \"Indigo Black,\" \"Lunar White\" and \"Sand.\" Sand is only available in 32GB and LTE is only available in Black 32GB currently. I ordered the \"Indigo Black\" version. Typically, Nexus devices have different surfaces on their backs depending on the color with the white tending to be more slippery.  As for how much space you'll have left after Android 5.0, well that's in (4).\n\nUnfortunately, Google has kept the no-Microsd slot feature again on another Nexus device. Part of this is due to security as it limits what you can plug into your device, partially not wanting to pay Microsoft the licensing fees for the patents and part of this is just a blatant money grab.  The Nexus 9 uses Samsung built MLC NAND storage in either 16GB or 32GB models. Google is charging $80 extra for the 32GB model. Based on wholesale NAND pricing easily found on the internet for contract pricing, that costs Google/HTC around $2.32. That results in markup of 3,448% over wholesale prices and that's a low estimate as I can't find the contract pricing for the 16GB chip. I didn't think it was possible, but someone finally is out charging Apple on storage upgrades. Take that as you will.\n\nNow you're thinking, 3,448% markup? That's insane! And you know what? You're absolutely right. Luckily, the Nexus 9 does support USB OTG. More on that later in section (7).\n\nWhew, that was a bit much wasn't it? Have a section summary!\n\nPros:\nBlazing fast dual core 64 bit processor, solid Screen at PPI 281, thin and light, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, dual band Wi-Fi, allows OTG and good speakers and mics.\n\nCons:\nNo Sapphire, No Microsd, $80 to bump from 16 GB to 32 GB, USB 2.0, only three color choices, and 4:3 aspect ratio.\n\nOther:\nOnly 2 GB of RAM, LTE version and Sand color version to be released at a future date.\n\n(2) Performance/Sound/Connectivity:\n\nThe Tegra K-1 has already been extensively bench marked and performance graphically wise is about on par with a PS3 or an Xbox 360. The Xbox and PS3 PC graphical equivalent is around an NVidia 7800/7900GTX. That's very old hardware to PC gamers, but to tablet gamers, that's a big gain. Lots of tech sites will claim that tablets (barring the Microsoft Surface line) are delivering PC performance, but they never actually define what that means. My Dell Venue 8 Pro can run Team Fortress 2. I would definitely not call that PC like performance compared to my Windows desktop or even a basic Chromebook.\n\nSound is solid for a tablet, which doesn't say much as a run of the mill Bluetooth speaker will provide better sound.  It's better than my old iPad 3, but tablet sound still has a long way to go before it can replace a regular speaker.\n\nThe Nexus 9 per other user tests and reported on XDA is not slimport capable, meaning you cannot connect the tablet to a HDMI equipped TV via a slimport adapter as video out from the USB port is not allowed. I don't have one of these adapters, mostly because they're fairly expensive.\n\nI've never seen the real need for cellular on my tablets, thus I continued my buying of Wi-Fi only. However, the tablet does offer an LTE version to be sold in the future. The LTE version currently works on GMS, CDMA, HSPA and LTE, meaning it should in theory work on all major carriers in the US, but we'll have to wait for actual bands to be provided. Verizon may make a big stink again about letting another Nexus tablet on their network. You probably just have to buy the Nexus 9 from Verizon if and when they let it on their network if you want a Verizon LTE Nexus 9.\n\nThe Nexus 9 will not connect to a Micro USB to Ethernet adapter, or at least the Smays adapter I have for a wired connection. Bluetooth is fine and quickly connects to a variety of devices. Wi-Fi quickly connected to both my regular router and my extender.\n\n(3) Camera:\n\nCameras include a front facing camera at 1.6 MP at f/2.4 and a back camera at 8.1 MP at f/2.4 both at 4:3 aspect ratio. There's a LED flash as well on the back. Nothing has changed about being silly taking pictures with a tablet camera since my Nexus 7 review. Anyways, iFixit tore down a Nexus 9 and the camera is the same one as the HTC Desire 610, thus a middle range quality camera. Front camera records at 720P where the back camera records at 1080P. Manual exposure is an option in settings. No HDR, but all of the regular functions from panorama, to lens blur and photo sphere are here.\n\nCamera quality is okay for both, with better results in well-lit areas. Image stabilization is about on par with the Nexus 5 and flash is fairly weak. Focus speed unfortunately seems actually a tad slower than the Nexus 5 which already had slow focus speed.\n\nThe camera itself is not flush with the back of the device and protrudes a little.\n\n(4) Android 5.0 Lollipop:\n\nWelcome to Google's latest and greatest (yes, I copied that from my Nexus 5 review). Android 5.0, also known as Lollipop brings extra features to the ball game. For one, ART replaced Dalvik, notifications are refreshed to be produced on cards and grouped by types of applications that generate them, and the recent app button shows now a stack of cards rather than applications vertically imposed. ART, or Android Run Time complies processes rather than running then just in time, which should increase performance. ART was previously offered alternative on devices like the Nexus 4 and 5, but it wasn't the default.\n\nBuild LRX21R was released a few days ago and is now makings its way to Nexus 9s in mass over the air. Build LRX21R which is a Nexus 9 specific patch to Android 5.0 seems to have fixed a number of software issues and overall the tablet seems faster on opening applications and loading content than it did on the build LRX21L that shipped with the Nexus 9.\n\nAnimations have been reworked and notifications are now able to be displayed on your lock screen (similar to how widgets allowed this on Android 4.4). Google seems to have ripped off Microsoft Vista's Aero wheel animation for applications.\n\nBattery life gets a boost from optimizations to restrict the operation of applications. A series of security related improvements are made, including default encryption.  If you have an Android Wear device, you can now automatically unlock when a device running 5.0 is close enough, a form of trusted area. I can now see frat boys grabbing an Android smart watch to unlock a passed out friend's phone/tablet.\n\nLike all good Nexus devices, the Nexus 9 has none of the carrier or manufacture obstacles to getting operating system updates.  Nor does it have any of the \"skins\" that companies such as HTC, LG, Samsung and others put over stock Android, meaning the Nexus 9 ships with absolutely pure Android. Furthermore, like all good Android devices, you're free to customize to your heart's content. Don't want any apps on your home screen? That's just fine. Want so many you can't see your background? Go for it. Hate the whole theme that stock 5.0 comes with? Install another launcher like Themer. You decide what your device looks like. That's the power of the Home Depot...I mean Android.\n\nApplications are still kind of lacking for Android in terms of tablet and some apps are simply not going to work on the newest version of Android until developers patch them. Also, many are geared for 16:10 aspect creating some issues with the tablet's 4:3 aspect ratio.\n\nThe back, home and recent on screen buttons have been simplified into something resembling the buttons from a play station controller. Home is now a circle, recent apps is a single square and back is a closed arrow.\n\nAndroid Lollipop 5.0 takes up a little under 6.5 GB of space. My Nexus 9 32 GB fresh out of the box and after a mandatory 264 MB patch had 25.6 GB free. Not as bad as Windows, but still quite hefty.\n\nWidget selection is identical to the Nexus 5 launcher where widgets are selected by holding on the home screen rather than the app drawer.\n\nI restarted both my Nexus 5 and my Nexus 9 and opened Chrome at the same time both on the same Wi-Fi network. The Nexus 9 loaded Chrome faster. I tried the same for YouTube and the Nexus 5 loaded faster. Google Drive they loaded about the same. Google Earth loaded a second or two faster on the Nexus 9. The Nexus 5 loaded the Amazon app initially faster but the Nexus 9 hands down beat it in loading all of the content in the app.\n\nFor those of you who refuse to hunt and peck in your typing, Swype works.\n\nThe native built in video player won't play MVK, MP4, MV4 or AVI.  But it is easy to transfer any file format to the device, unlike iOS.\n\nFinally, if you get bored, go to settings -> About Tablet -> Android Version - Tap a few times till the lollipops come up and then hold. Prepare for Flappy Android! Google built in an Easter Egg clone of Flappy Bird, which is really just a modern version of the classic game Helicopter. See my Photobucket link for more details.\n\n(5) 64 Bit & ARMv8:\n\nAs the Nexus 9 is the first Android tablet that's running both a 64bit processor and a 64bit operating system, I felt a need to explain what 64 bit processing  actually is and does. Furthermore, the K-1 is one of the first Android oriented processors that is running ARMv8. Explaining 64 bit in detail could take an essay, so here's the simplistic short explanation: Data is processed in bits and 64 bit vs the existing 32 bit allows larger amounts of data to be processed faster in larger registers, thus in theory allowing a device running both a 64 bit processor and a 64 bit operating system to perform significantly faster than a 32 bit processor/OS. 64 bit does not operate 100% faster than 32 bit.\n\nDue to the increased ability to processor more data faster, a 64 bit system like the Nexus 9, iPhone 6, most Windows desktop and laptops and many Chromebooks will consume more RAM. This is why the 64 bit push has generally been associated with having more RAM as 64 bit computing allows a device to access more than 4GB of memory locations. Electronics in history have run into serious RAM related crash issues when a 64 bit device is run on 2GB or less RAM. Many Windows Blue Screens of Death were related to RAM overruns.\n\nARMv8 is ARM's (who designs the basic foundation for ARM processors that power mobile devices from Apple to Samsung) latest instruction set release. Ars Technica reported that the iPhone 5s's processor gains were 90% from ARMv8 and 10% from various other aspects like 64 bit and processor improvements showing just how important ARM's work is. The K-1's massive performance over 32 bit processors seems to suggest this is true, especially since it is just a dual core processor where many of the 32 bit were and still are quad core processors. Every manufacturer has stated they're moving towards chips running on ARMv8, but this is the first mainstream one to hit the Android market.\n\n(6) Battery & Charging:\n\nBattery is rated at 3.8 volt, 6700 mAh, and 25.46 watt hours with an alleged 9.5 hours of browsing. Gaming will of course reduce battery life and given the graphics core on the K-1, gamers are going to run the battery down. I'm getting about 7-8 hours on mundane usage and charging speed is about average with other tablets.\n\nAs much as this tablet represents the future, it also represents the past. No wireless charging available. Personally, I've never been a fan of wireless charging simply because it generates excess heat inside the battery which tends to reduce battery longevity. Wireless charging is without question more convenient, but if you plan on keeping your devices for a while or handing them down to friends and family, extending the battery life of a device should be important and wireless charging doesn't do that. The Nexus 9 is still going to be plugged in and charged via the standard, ubiquitous micro USB.\n\n(7) USB OTG:\n\nUSB OTG, otherwise known as On-The-Go is a series of protocols that allows the access of the USB port for things other than charging. The Nexus 9 supports USB OTG meaning that instead of paying $80 for an extra 16 GB of storage at a 3,448% markup, you can instead buy low cost flash drives, SD cards and Microsd cards for 50 cents or less per gigabyte. Couple that with a low priced USB Reader like a Meenova and a low priced USB OTG cable that can be found for less than $2 right here on Amazon and you've got storage to spare. One fabulous aspect of using external media is that it's incredibly easy to share and transfer large amounts of files without using data. Sharing 50 GB of files is not a fast proposition with the cloud.\n\nUnfortunately, the Nexus 9 does not natively recognize most USB OTG flash drives. It will recognize smart phones and automatically start a file transfer. For flash drives, you're going to need some form of app to bridge the gap. USB On-The-Go Disk Explorer has a free version, but I'm just going to use the Nexus Media Importer app I've had for a while.\n\nNexus Media Importer app works just fine as long as the file format is not exFat. However, it will not play MKV files natively, but VLC will play them from the Nexus Media Importer. There is zero lag on OTG streaming even on 8GB HD quality movies.  Keyboards, mice, flash drives are all handled without problem. Also, I was able to copy files back and forth between the tablet and the flash drive.\n\n(8) Build & Looks:\n\nThis tablet does look like an iPad. You could probably walk into an Apple store and people wouldn't be any wiser. A metal frame runs around the edges with soft plastic backing. This is a clear improvement upon the Nexus 7 line. The back is a smooth matte black. The buttons for power and volume up/down barely protrude from the case and requires some getting used to. Side bezels are 0.7 centimeters, and top and bottom bezels are slight less than 2.5 centimeters.\n\n(9) Other:\n\nNow, where should you buy this? Amazon offers free shipping and for most states, no sales taxes. However, Amazon's RMA process in the event of a defect can often go hairy as at some point in time, Amazon sends you over to the manufacturer, or HTC to fix your problems. This can result in a run around where HTC will tell you to contact Google, Google tell you to contact where you bought it from, aka Amazon in this case and Amazon telling you to contact HTC. This has happened to more than a few electronics buyers.\n\nGoogle directly sells this, but charges shipping of $9.99 for three day delivery. There's also sales tax but it's wildly varied from less than 50 cents to $30+. Google however, will take back your Nexus device on RMA without more than a basic inquiry if you bought the device from them. You'll pay more than Amazon, but you'll have a much easier time in case of a defect.\n\nLocal stores like BestBuy also sell it with price match to Amazon. Depending on your state, you'll have different sale tax mileage. Note it is obviously easier to return a defective product to a local physical store.\n\nHTC/Google is also selling an origami cover similar to the type that the Kindle Fire line has as well as a keyboard cover that turns it into a laptop.\n\niFixit gave the Nexus 9 a 3 out of 10 on repair-ability so probably bad idea to go about fixing it yourself.\n\n(10) Quality Control:\n\nSadly, this Nexus release appears to be mirroring the original Nexus 7 rather than the Nexus 4 or 5 launches with significant quality control issues. While plenty of users are reporting that their devices have zero hardware problems, far too many are reporting significant light bleed, back cover flimsiness, broken NFC, bad Wi-Fi and other hardware issues for those to be outliers. Therefore, in terms of pure quality control issues, my suggestion is to simply wait a few months until the quality control issues are sorted out. When the device is properly made it's amazing, but when it's not, it's terrible.\n\nI happened to get a device with minimal back flex and no noticeable light bleed. During my application quickness tests, I noticed my Nexus 5 actually has more light bleed and I've been using that since November of 2013 without noticing. Mine, like others does get a noticeably warm in the top by the camera during usage.\n\n(11) TLDR:\n\n$399 base unit, lightning fast, newest Android OS, looks like an iPad, Xbox360/PS3 graphics, no Microsd, no wireless charging, USB OTG allowed and no wireless charging.\n\nConclusion: Phenomenal tablet that's exceptionally flexible and productive but currently hampered by quality control issues. If you're set on buying a high quality Android tablet, wait a month or two before picking a Nexus 9 up.\n\nFor some reason I cannot post pictures, so here's my Photobucket album of the Nexus 9: http://tinyurl.com/mb58bcl"}

I had a 2013 N7, which I wasn't thrilled with, and eventually it got stuck in a boot loop.\n\nI really like the size of this tablet, and I like the 4:3 ratio on the screen. The tablet is larger, so there's more real estate on the screen, but it still fits in my purse, so it's still very portable. It's light to hold and excellent to watch videos on. I do a LOT of reading, so the weight is important to me, particularly for reading in bed. Lollipop is a HUGE step in Android. Very smooth, very nice. The camera takes pretty good pictures, but honestly, I will hardly ever use the camera, so that wasn't all that important to me.\n\nLoving it!"}

Basically alot of media consumption and those black lines did not do it for me. the video size got smaller than expected.\n\nThere was ALOT of backlight bleeding the display to the point where it was all i was looking at and could not take it anymore.

It has a beautiful screen, a fast processor, the new Android OS is awesome, the speakers rock, and the 4:3 ratio that I've been waiting for on an Android tablet. It's not perfect though. It's overpriced by about $80 in my estimation. The 16/32GB of storage is tragic (32/64GB would've made more sense). And the quality control isn't up to snuff. My tablet is awesome, but many others received tablets that were poorly manufactured. From what I'm seeing, the white tablets appear to be  better manufactured than the black ones.

Plus, Android 5 is not the second coming.  Google Mail is the primary highlight.  I know there are more features that are worthy but $479 for a 8.9\" tablet with 32 gig of memory and not microSD capability, this is a Google blunder.\n\nGoogle has to get a new firmware out ASAP or this one is going back.

My Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1's screen actually blows it out of the water in all respects.\n- The weight, it's not heavy nor light for it's size\n- The battery life seems average\n\nAs you can see, with 3 pros, 3 cons, and 3 mehs, it gets 3 stars.

Unlike most, I actually didn't have bad light bleed issues.  I had worse issues such as the now well known back casing flexing and making an annoying pop/squeak when it would.  I also had an issue of the cpu getting hot, so hot in fact that I had two crashes from overheating.  This wasn't during gaming, this was in the first hour of having it and when it was downloading and installing apps.  Even if I wouldn't have been crashing, it make it unconformable to hold landscape when one hand was quite a bit hotter than the other.  I also had very poor touch screen sensitivity that made typing on the it a chore.  Lastly my \"lower\" speaker didn't work.  Overall the tablet had very very bad quality control and design issues.  I had been using the nexus 7 2013 without any issues and have since replace the nexus 9 with last year's LG G Pad 8.3 google play edition and I am much happier.\n  I think this would have been an ok $199 or even $250 tablet, but NOT $479.  The tablet excludes cheapness and poor construction and is no where as well built as an ipad.

I consider myself an Android fanboy. I owned a Nexus 7 (2013) and bought into the hype that the Nexus 9 was the best at everything, fastest processor, great screen resolution, new Lollipop 5, what was there not to like? But I don't do that much on a tablet. I don't play games. I may read some email, surf the Internet, and listen to various music apps. I am returning my Nexus 9 (32gb) because it really doesn't do anything my Nexus 7 doesn't do given how I use it. To all of those that are like me always wanting the newest and best do not buy this. Especially don't buy this if you already have a Nexus 7. My device has the white edge bleed that everyone is referring to. My device feels cheap and bulky. The back is silver not white like a Samsung white (never have owned a Samsung anything). This device isn't any better than the Nexus 7. Certainly not $479 better. I would not give $300 for this tablet unless it was the only tablet I owned. The 2 speakers are the only plus and it does sound good but not for what they are asking. I bought in to all the experts opinion on how this tablet was the \"bests of the year\".

In my experience it lives up to real world expectations about what a tablet can/should be.  That is to say it is not going to change your life, but it shouldn't be expected to.  The build quality is pretty darn good.  There is no extra flex in my back panel like some reviews have pointed out.  The power and volume buttons have a low profile and it is exaggerated because the pack panel is slightly larger then the front which puts a slight bevel to the edge of the device which is odd but not really significant.  Double tap to turn on the screen almost eliminates the search for the power button, however I cant say double tap works 100% of the time.  To that point, I have noticed that my first tap on the screen is not recognized 100% of the time either, but that is true of every touch screen I have ever used.  The resolution looks great to my human eyes.  At certain angles there can be a glare but that can be fixed by moving my hand half an inch in either direction.  The speakers are clear & loud even when I purposely cover them with my fingers and, if you aren't expecting 7.2 dolby digital surround, you should enjoy them just fine.  App performance has been good, however there are still a good number of apps that are not set up to run on Lollipop.  That is to be expected when you are dealing with the absolute latest operating system.  That brings us to the best reason to buy this machine, access to the cutting edge of android.  The innards will, no doubt, hold up over the next two years (at the very least) and you will be able to take advantage of all the new awesome that Android will have to offer.  If you have already bought in to the apple universe you probably aren't looking at a nexus anyway.  Go buy last years Air for the same price.  If you are wrapped in the warm blanket of Mountain View this product is pretty sweet."}

It does NOT get too hot for touch though.  But it will warm your lap. When holding there is the metallic edge around the screen that is just high enough to protect the screen when layer on that edge.  Problem is when you hold it, the edge can be uncomfortable to your fingers when holding on the edge.  But here is the thing on these issues. Just buy a cover.

Also, the build quality could be a little better, and it could be thinner, more like the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, that to me is the perfect weight and thickness.  The thing that really saves this is the new Lollipop OS.  It is fantastic!  Very fast and smooth!  The screen is nice and sharp.  So I am giving it 4 stars because of Lollipop.  I am sure that it will be a very popular tablet but I think it could have been better, especially for the price.....although I noticed that Amazon has already dropped the price from $400 to $386!  The other thing that bothers me is that after using the tablet for awhile I gets very warm, I've never had this happen with any other tablet I own!  The HTC stereo speakers are fantastic, better than I've ever experienced, so that is a big plus.

This is insanity! Don't reload the tab, there's no need with the memory available here. I shouldn't have to wait to read the new page until a page reload just due to some system memory saving rule. Also, if I'm on a forum for example, & typing a response to a comment on one tab, but need to grab a quote from another tab, when I go back to the first tab the page reloads & my drafted response is lost.

Its not enough play for me to be concerned about. Should it be there? Absolutely not, but people make it out to be a bigger issue than it is. It'll get ironed out in the later revision (hopefully). I have fairly minor light bleed from the black light, all my IPS display devices (Nexus 5 & Nexus 7 (2013) have light bleed... its pretty common among various devices. Only visible on black screens at least on my model. No dead pixels, and the screen looks immaculate.\n\nHeat from the chip is pretty apparent, even with light usage it'll get warm to the touch. When gaming its a bit more intense, nothing that'll make me stop gaming, but its there. I intend to throw custom firmware and a kernel on my device at a later time to deal with the heat. Im sure it'll get sorted out in a software update as well.\n\nCamera is nothing special, its a camera on a tablet, made for convience nothing else.\n\nScreen is super crisp, and colors are nice.\n\nFirst time I've gotten to experience Lollipop, and I must say it is quite sweet. The animations and fluidity of the software are constant eye candy for me. I can sit here and pull down the notification tray a hundred times and still be impressed. No hints of lag or slowing down in sight, not quite sure what other reviewers are talking about.. this thing flies.\n\nLastly, the speakers... EARGASM. You'll never want to go back to any other directional speakers. Front facing speakers really ought to be the standard. These things get LOUD, and they sound amazing with no distortion (from what ive heard).\n\nAll in all, my one and only complaint so far is the darn price tag. 500$+ after tax and shipping really irks me. On top of which, HTC had a fire sale that lasted all of 2 minutes having the thing half off. Why didn't they go with a cheaper price to begin with? I'm big believer in bang for buck.. and this thing just doesn't quite live up to the price tag.\n\nThat'd being said.. I'd buy it again. Its great, I like it a lot, but man 500$... yeesh."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "First of all I would like to urge people to not look too far into these ridiculous negative reviews. Some of which might have actually received a defective unit which is not uncommon in a major launch but some of these reviews are definitely not legitimate. Just please do your research.\n\nMost reviews on the major tech sites seemed to think this tablet is just average and its not worth it. There is a lot of Apple bias on a lot of these sites so take them all with a grain of salt. I have seem plenty of reviews saying this tablet is great. Most reviews seem to focus more on comparing the tablet instead of actually reviewing it. Most reviews complain so much about it not feeling like an iPad instead of focusing on how it actually performs. Keep an eye open for people complaining about no SD card slots, any review stating this is a negative should be deleted. Everyone knows nexus devices will never have SD card slots not to mention that the description states it doesn't have one.\n\nThe only things you could take as a negatives are that the tablet memory starts at 16 GB and the max is 32 GB. I wish 32 GB was the minimum so it would be 400$ for 32 GB and 479$ for 64 GB. Also was hoping for being a premium model it was going to be 3 or 4 GB of RAM but when you realize that Apple still limits their top tablets to 1 GB RAM, its not so bad.\n\nI have not experienced any screen bleed or any other build defects on mine. I cannot really make a comment about battery life until I get some more use out of it but it doesn't seem too bad at all.\n\nIts simple:\n\n-If you love Nexus devices this is a must have\n-If you love Android this is a must have\n-Android 5.0 is an amazing and fast OS\n-The speakers are exceptional, some seem to think they are nothing too special but I am very impressed with how loud they are\n-The size is perfect, I would have preferred closer to 8.5 inches but it is a very solid size\n-The screen looks great\n-Some people report lagging but I have not seem much lag at all. Every tablet with have occasional lag when loading certain apps\n-It is incredibly thin\n-The back might not be made out of amazing material but it does not bother me at all since you would be a fool to not use a case with this tablet anyway\n-If you care about getting the latest updates from Google immediately then this your tablet\n-If you like being able to expand the storage indefinitely with a 99 cent OTG cable and a USB drive then you will love this\n\nThis is a solid tablet that is worth the price because of Android still being a superior OS to iOS, the lack of blotware apps from other companies you cannot delete, inexpensive ways to expand storage, fast performance, great speakers, and good build quality."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "It kills me to say it, but this is a horrible device. I just got mine the other day, and all issues that people are discussing I have had. The screen bleeds, device gets hot in the top right corner. No build quality issues that I noticed. My battery on a full charge only lasts 3 hours with just browsing on chrome. OK Google only works about 10% of the time. Apps especially games don't scale properly. The device has serious lag, especially when switching apps, or opening new ones.\n\nAs a diehard android user ever since the G1, it is a shame that they would release a product with so many issues. I'm sure most of it is software related, but at this point I don't want to take that chance. Just returned the device. hopefully my Nexus 6 doesn't have these issues."}

Much to my surprise my tablet was 100% defect free and just a wonderful performer. No build or display issues were present. 55,000+ on antutu benchmark test with real world efficiency to match. I own the Nvidia shield tablet, nexus 10, galaxy tab s 10.5 and the galaxy tab s 8.4 so I can adequately compare it to other Android tablets. The negative reviewers can be placed into 1 of three categories.\n1. Actual recipients of a defective product\n2. Egocentric consumers who inspect what they buy under electron microscopy\n3. People with a hidden agenda\n My example was spot on with regards to fit, finish, form and performance. The 2 year old nexus 10 is still a wonderful tablet with the new nexus 9 being like its young and spry grandson! The nexus 7 is good as well albeit too small for my aging eyes. Either I got very lucky or the nexus 9 is a very worthwhile tablet."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "I have had almost every form factor of an Android tablet. I started with the Asus Transformer (TF101), which was a 10.1 inch and a 1.6 aspect ratio. While I was using it, I got my wife a Nexus 7 (1st gen, which I really liked) and subsequently moved on to an 8.3 inch G-pad from LG. I really liked the 8.3 inch as it was very portable and swore to never go to a bigger form factor. When the Nexus 9 released, I just had to give it a try. In the meantime, I also currently own a Nexus5 and have been using the dev edition of lollipop and reporting issues as I see them (a good of them have been fixed in this release).\n\nFirst, the tablet is a lot wider than the G-pad. This is mostly because of the aspect ratio of 4:3 than 16:10. It is probably not as tall but this one, I can barely hold with one hand gripped on either side. Add this to the fact that buttons are tighter to press and it can sometimes be a very frustrating experience.\n\nThe screen has a lot of light bleed along the corners. This is very obvious at start-up especially under darker settings. Once the tablet boots. However, this does not seem to have any impacts during runtime (at least it did not hurt my eye). I ran some HD videos (avengers trailer, for example) and the contrast under brightly lit conditions were pretty good.\n\nThe 4:3 ratio is going to really frustrate if you want to watch a movie on it. There are going to be big black bars on top and bottom especially when watching a anamorphic aspect ratio (i did the math and it turns out that the visual is actually going to be a little bigger than on my g-pad 8.3 but just barely. An additional .6 inch of screen barely increases the width by 0.15 inches due to this aspect ratio. However, the perception of size with the black bars is what I am talking about. It will get better with 16.9 aspect).\n\nThe tablet, for all I have put it thro' was very smooth. I have not installed any apps or games yet and cannot speak to those but it mostly reacts without a lag. That is a big (and pleasant change) when I compare it to my G-pad.\n\nThe stereo speaks worked pretty well. I am not an audiophile but have a reasonable taste for good audio. I can say that it was reasonable pair of speakers.\n\nThe camera is not so great though (again, I use a DSLR and recently switched to a D750). Even at ISO600, noise is pretty apparent. I believe a lot of camera phones do significantly better. again, not going to use it for taking awesome pictures but only do occasional hangouts and such.\n\nI would seriously suggest getting a cover (I have never used one without) but one where you can slide you hand to hold it to read would be very useful. That said, holding the tablet on the side was not too tiring either. The lack of cases is worrisome (there are lots advertised on Amazon but none that are immediately available. The magic cover is nice but comes at a steep price. However, that will probably be the best cover for this tablet. That said, it isn't available either.\n\nThe OS, I cannot say much about because I have been used to this interface for a few months now but the layout definitely feels rich.\n\nComing to battery life. I have had this for a few days now and have been closely monitoring battery use and it appears very efficient. For a full charge, I got about 9 hours of screen time which is more than adequate for my needs. The tablet did not get hot on any part of the backside either for long durations. Again, I have not played graphic intensive games so cannot speak for it.\n\nOverall, I am happy with the tablet in the few days I have used it."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Returning mine. Not because of light bleed or back plate issues. The way I see it, my nexus 7 is better. The nexus 9 is running 5.0 which is buggy! Part of that is google, part of it are developers who are still living in a 4.x world of android. So, android 5.0 plus htc tablet plus lazy developers = fairly mediocre experience. Bummer, because I loved the tablet for 2-3 days, then I started seeing a lot of problems. Widgets are a huge problem, and many apps crash or freeze the tablet. If the prices drop to the 250-350 range, plus android 5.x improves with time, it may turn out to be a 4 or 5 star tablet."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Where to start with this tablet...\nI had such high hopes for it and I'm left wondering if it's worth the money.\n\nIf you follow any tech sites you've read about the problems.\nLight bleed is one of them. This honestly is not too bad on the one I have. I would say you will find some light bleed on most LED screens.\n\nThe back is flexible. Yes I can flex it if I push on it. I would have to ask why would you do that to begin with?\nIt's not a requirement to use the tablet. Don't squeeze it, hold it.\n\nFront speakers are weak in some applications. Using it for navigation with Google maps and I could barely hear it. Possible software fix? As said it can be app specific.\n\nAnd the real issue I have a problem with, screen flicker. In some cases with the screen brightness set on the low side the screen will have slight flickering to it. Very annoying and I'm not sure this can be corrected with a software update.\n\nBack gets warm on the upper half. Yes it does with moderate to heavy activity. You'll find out when you open it and it updates everything on it. I would think this is probably software correctable to an extent.\n\nThe battery drains fast. I would agree and hope as the refine lollipop they can help correct this too.\n\nOf all that I listed I'm hoping most can be addressed with an update. Obviously a flexible back is what you get and short of replacing it it's not going to change. I do have major concerns with the screen flickering.\nI'm not convinced it's software as I do not use auto brightness. I have 9 or so days before I have to request an RMA from Google and hope to see an update that makes me feel better about it.\n\nFor those complaining about the 4:3 screen. You knew what it would look like before you bought it.\nIf you didn't like an iPad display you weren't going to like this one.\n\nI do feel a little ripped off with the price. Might return it and stick with the nexus 7 2013 before they go missing. Other than being bigger, I will not say it much better than the 7."}

Tablet rocks! So does Google play store! Ordered mine right after pre order began from amazon, they screwed me over and put me on a waiting list til January 6th! Ha! Canceled and ordered my tablet on Google play on the 3rd. It was delivered on the 4th.  No issues whatsoever, also do not rely on reviews written by people who are not verified purchasers here on amazon. You can't trust reviewers who are not verified. You don't know if they are actual purchasers. I love mine. No over heating, no white lines or black bleeding. Nothing but a top of the line, turbo speed, high definition, rocking good tablet. I highly recommend. I ran my tablet for about ten hours before I needed to recharge. And android 5.0 is awesome, I love how Google now is always listening now, plus it's very responsive and fast.  Plus front facing speakers really rock, and believe it or not, but you can actually hear bass! Wow! Htc did really good with this tablet!  If there are problems with any white lines or black bleeds or what ever else, those are htc quality control issues anyway not Googles fault.  Software runs as smooth as butter!  If there are problems with quality control, then I hope they were fixed quick. My order wasn't a pre order,I didn't order until after it was released, so maybe the issues were with early release tabs. I absolutely love this tablet, it's The best yet that I have owned. I currently own a galaxy tab pro 10.1, a lenovo yoga 8, HP slate 8 pro and an Asus memo pad 10 FHD.  That's not including all the tablets I have sold back to amazon or best buy, lol.

Boo.\n\nProblem 1:  The back cover is clearly paper thin because I can depress it, and it pops out back into place.\n\nIf the back cover couldn't be pushed in like a pop-up-button, I'd say yeah, definitely an (almost) premium build.\n\nI believe the root cause is the back cover was manufactured slightly too big and when it is installed onto the frame, it bows out.\n\nProblem 2: My screen also has a significant light bleed in one spot.  Not noticeable during most use so far.\n\nAll the other positives about the device are true.  Lollipop is pretty amazing (despite a few bugs here and there I've already ran into).\n\nAt this price, I expect flagship build quality.  If I get a replacement that doesn't have these quality issues (unfortunately black), then I would say the Nexus 9 should be about $100 cheaper than an ipad air2 in terms of build quality.\n\nAlso at this time amazon appstore seems to be 100% non functional."}

I had been looking forward to this release for quite a while, but I returned it tonight, 1 day after I bought it. First it took over 45 minutes to get it up and running. And then it just never worked as smoothly or as quickly as my previous iPad. Clicking on a link in Facebook to read an article would leave me waitingwaitingwaiting for it to open. I did a test, and timed it against my moto x to open a link, and my phone opened it immediately while this tablet was still... spinning. It seemed to have a problem connecting to my wifi, which none of my other devices do.  I did system resets 3 times since yesterday, trying to get it to work right. No luck. When I returned it to Best Buy, I was told it was the 2nd one to be returned tonight. I exchanged it for an iPad Air for the exact same price, which was up and working perfectly within minutes. Too bad, I wanted to love it but Apple again has proven itself to be the best."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "Was really looking forward to this tablet. Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype. As an android diehard who always gets into why android is so much better than apple, this tablet left me wanting more. At the time I had the nexus 9 I had a nexus 7(2013) and an iPad Air to compare it to.\n\nWas completely underwhelmed by the performance of it and build quality. For $400 I was expecting more especially since it is now in iPad Air price bracket . I consider myself an android diehard but will be waiting until more tablets start rolling out with android lollipop and see what else comes out. Bought an iPad Air to play around with and quality is there, can't argue with that , but still not 100% satisfied with the UI and OS of the iPad . To top it all off when HTC decided to slash the price of the nexus 9 by 50% for a limited time and then back up to $400 just aggravated how I felt about the tablet so back it went. I really wanted to love this tablet but build quality wasn't up to par with the similarly priced iPad Air and there was some lag and minor stutters that needed to be ironed out before I think about picking up the nexus 9 again.\n\nPros-\n\nScreen size is perfect medium for everyday use. Not too small like the nexus 7 not too big like 10\" plus tablets.\nLollipop 5.0 best looking android update yet.\nSpeakers are decent, plus front facing dual speakers. Again nothing game changing and there's really no depth the the audio,  to me they just sound okay. ( compared to the iPad Air with a rear facing speaker only on one end of the tablet, the nexus 9 definitely has the advantage here.)\nCons\n\nBuild quality . Rubber back feels cheap, or at least cheaper and lower quality than the nexus 7 (2013). The back also has some air gaps between the back cover and the body of the tablet. When you press down on the back cover it gets pushed down and doesn't feel as sold overall as the iPad Air I had to compare it to. Also, noticed slight backlight bleed through the sides of the screen. Camera quality not good either for an 8 mp camera. Same for the front facing camera. And there is a slight lag when you take a picture before it saves where the iPad Air camera instantly saves.\n\nStutters and lags. Was expecting a fluid and lag free experience but unfortunately there were occasional lags where opening an app would be delayed. Or closing down an app to go back to the home screen would cause the tablet to freeze up for a second before it goes to the home screen.\n\nDisplay. While the display is great, when compared to the iPad Air with I believe the exact same screen resolution the iPad looks just a little more higher quality. This was especially apparent when I did a side by side comparison watching a movie on Netflix. The movie on the iPad just looked clearer and more vibrant than on the nexus 9. Nexus 7 has both beat though with higher ppi, due to smaller screen size and if I recall correctly same screen resolution.\n\nPrice - $400 is just too much for this tablet especially when compared to the iPad Air with the same price. And after HTC did their \"hot deal\" sale ONE day after the release and ONE day after I paid $400 for it I knew tHis tablet had to go back. At $200 I would have definitely kept it but why HTC did what they did I have no idea. Pretty much telling everyone who bought it for full price that your $400 tablet is really worth $200. Won't be looking back at the tablet until it's sub $300. Skip for now."}

The back has a kind of lose feeling too it, and when I apply minimal stress to opposite corners it flexes with ease. I really hate the feel of this thing. The operating system, lollipop, is petty amazing.  It looks fantasy and flows beautifully together. The performance seems pretty weak for having what is widely considered to be a monster. Apps load slowly, transitions are choppy and at times things are just down right laggy. I think I'm most disappointed with the camera. It's the slowest thing I've ever seen, and when it finally does take a photo, the picture looks like grainy crap with tons of moron blur. And last but not least, no SD card slot...  If I were you I would get something else."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "At first glance during unboxing, it would be easy to mistake the Nexus 9 as just another ho hum offering in a long list of look-alike Android tablets. But as we all know, looks can be deceiving, and in this case, I can say with all certainty that they most definitely are. This is one beast of a tablet, tamed by a FINALLY well polished 5.0 Lollipop OS. Is it a perfect tablet? I think you can find fault with any tablet, whether Apple or Android. But, the HTC Nexus 9 is BY FAR the closest anyone has gotten.\n\nMuch ado has been made about the iPad Air 2, and rightfully so, although IOS 8 still has a few bugs to work out, so its inevitable that the Nexus 9 is going to be compared. Let's just cut to the chase. For me, at least, I can say something I never thought I'd be saying: I'll be returning my Air 2. Here's why:\n\nForm Factor\nThe 9 got this just right. The switch to a 4:3 aspect and 8.9 inch screen puts it right in the sweet spot between the 7 inch tablets or the iPad mini series, both of which often had text just a little too small, and the 10.1 tablets or the full sized iPad, which offer a comfortable viewing experience while being considered just a bit cumbersome when considering portability. The 9 very nicely fits the Goldilocks space of being \"just right\". You get the 7 inch wide screen for movies AND the extra real estate of the 4:3 aspect for games, web surfing, and eBook reading. You get the best of both worlds while still being comfortable and well balanced for single hand use. The 9 just feels right!\n\nScreen\nLet's get this out of the way: the AMOLED screens in the Samsung S series tablets are unbeatable. There. But,I can absolutely say that the 9's screen is every bit as good as the Air 2 (with the exception of the Air's anti reflective coating), offering an identical resolution, but with higher DPI, giving the 9 the edge in sharpness. It's bright, bold, and beautiful, with a full color range that gives accurate representation while providing a nice \"pop\".\n\nSound\nNobody really expects much from a tablet as far as sound is concerned. With the exception of the Kindle HD 7, which had exceptional sound, tablets offered generally bland, tinny, unimpressive audio. Looking at the tiny slits of the front facing speakers of the 9, you'd expect more of the same. The reality is, however, not only impressive, but downright awesome sound that easily surpasses anything out there for tablets. Great high to mid tones. Does it lack bass? Absolutely. But it's the closest thing you'll get without turning to headphones. The aural experience of these speakers with the 5.1 Dolby surround turned on is not simply technically impressive; it genuinely adds immersiveness in watching movies. Extremely impressive. The 9's sound is really that good.\n\nBuild\nThe iPad build is unmatched...I won't make excuses here. But I can say that the Nexus 9 is well made, and the plastic back makes perfect sense to you when the NVIDIA K1 kicks into high gear. The upper left side, when in landscape, gets really warm. If they'd used an aluminum back, some would undoubtedly find the heat uncomfortable. Which brings us to:\n\nPerformance\nBrace yourselves. Speed is coming. Three words: HOLY FREAKIN' CRAP! 53,223 in Antutu? Are you kidding me?!? I briefly held the number 1 spot in the top 200 Antutu scores. By a wide margin. A very wide margin. What you get from all this power is silkysweet navigation, browsing, and absolutely killer gaming. Imagine yourself as a kid flopping belly first onto a Slip n Slide for the first time. That's what using the Nexus 9 feels like. But obviously, this is also probably due to the...\n\nOperating System\nLollipop is GOOD. Very, very good. It is well polished, vastly more simplistic while also being far more capable than any previous Android version. How much better is it? Let's just say that you'll recognize the icons. That's where the familiarity ends. Put an R in front of evolutionary, and that will describe how much better Android 5.0 is. Google absolutely knocked this out of the park. And over the outfield bleachers. Into the parking lot. Where it broke the windshield of a car with an Apple logo on it.\n\nNegatives\nLet's face it. 32 GB of storage barely cuts it anymore. I dearly wish that HTC and Google would have allowed microSD expansion (a big plus that has always distinguished Android from Apple), or at LEAST dropped the 16 gig model and offered a 32 and 64 gig version instead. And that's honestly the only real criticism I have about this tablet.\n\nConclusions\nDon't get me wrong... I'm not claiming that you'll find the HTC Nexus 9 to be better than the iPad Air 2. That's a matter of preference. What I am saying is that finally, FINALLY we have an unequivicable Android alternative that's every bit an equal, on virtually every level, that even the most dedicated Apple fanboi would have to begrudgingly acknowledge. Let me put it this way:  I enjoy and use both Apple and Android. That's because each had something the other lacked. But, for the first time ever, I can  finally return my iPad and feel like I'm not really missing out on anything."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00M6UC5B4", "review": "HTC built a great tablet.  It is very basic looking.  It's like a larger version of my Nexus 5.  The operating system is stock Android Lollipop.  I like the new material design and how fluid the apps open and close.  I enjoy the double tap on the screen to wake it up instead of using the buttons.  The screen is beautiful and the front facing speakers sound nice.  The battery life has been good the limited amount of time that I've used it.\n\nIs this tablet for you?  We live in a time where most of the tablets have similar apps, abilities and specs.  Do you already have an Android tablet and like it?  There's no reason to upgrade.  Do you like Apple products better?  That's fine, if it's not your style, it's not your style.  Are you a Nexus fan or looking for a larger new Android tablet?  This would be an excellent choice."}
