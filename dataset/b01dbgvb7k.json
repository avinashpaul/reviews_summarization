{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "We got this for my sister who needed a computer for work and college and so far it has been excellent. Sound quality is even better than my laptop, picture quality is great for the cost and it feels very durable and reliable. The computer is about the size of an A4 sheet of paper which is great if you are gonna carry it around for school or work and pretty lightweight. So far the computer has been fast and no real hiccups and movies can be watched at a relatively great quality, it's not gonna run anything at 4K and you can only play the most basic of games if you need to know that but the specs already tell you as much.\nI personally think that the people that decry this computer as being an inferior piece of hardware or a 5-year-old's laptop are just pampered by the power of more expensive computers. If you want a computer that you can use for work/school needs, watch videos and movies, listen to music and maybe even play some browser-based or smartphone games then this will work. If, on the other hand, you need to run powerful apps like Photoshop, Animate, Mudbox or use it for more taxing games then you should look for more powerful options."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "As far as the computer itself is concerned, it works perfectly. It does what it's supposed to and so far, I haven't had any problems with it.  I bought it specifically for work. I take 3 buses (in Ecuador), so one can imagine that the robust make is coming in handy. There are some laptops of this size that are lighter, but the 10-hour long battery really means that I don't need to take the charger with me, so that helps with the weight. One of the main reasons I decided to go with this model, too, was because of the HDMI. This definitely helps me with presentations to be used on the projector.\n\nThe only bad thing I can think of is that people, this isn't Windows!  You're gonna play hob trying to get some apps from Windows that you really want/need.  There are certain files that can only be opened using Windows as well, such as .exe files. If I had known about the Chromebook's  incapability of opening .exe files, I definitely\nwould've  gone for a Windows laptop instead.  So there you have it-- If you think you're going to be using such files or apps, don't go with a Chromebook (or even Mac for that matter) and stick to Windows."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "To start off, I want to say that for the price that I paid (~$150), I think it's a fair product. Even at this price now ($219) I think it's still a fair product. However, I think it's important to rate this based on the \"intended\" uses and how well it performs them regardless of cost.\n\nI wanted something mobile that I could use to take notes and browse the web. Maybe watch a video here and there. I did not have intentions to play games (even mobile ones), or perform heavy laborious tasks. The bar I'm setting is pretty low.\n\nYet it *still* is too darn slow.\nGranted, I see some reviews on here saying it freezes or doesn't work at all, and while I've only been using it for a few weeks I haven't run into issues that bad. Well, a freeze here and there but it reboots quickly and only freezes after I close it and let it sit for a bit so far.\n\nThe problem is, for the simple apps I use for work (for taking notes and task lists for co-workers), it *works*, but it's so slow it's caused me grief in a few meetings because it was stuck loading when I wanted to be typing while someone was talking.\nAs an example, it just took 32 seconds to open one of my notes.\nI performed the same operation on my iPhone 7 Plus, and it was instantaneous - literally less than half a second (granted the phone is several times more expensive).\n\nI need to make sure I open up everything I need prior to a meeting, and hope it doesn't freeze and require a reboot; which happened this morning.\nIn fact, during that downtime of reboot and loading, I was able to instantly bring up my notes cold on my phone, and start jotting things down, before switching back to the chromebook when it finished loading.\n\nAnd mobile games? Don't even bother! Unless you're playing simple card games or something.\n\nIn summary, if you are using this just to goof around, or you have plenty of time, then yes, it's a viable economical model. However if you want to use this for work, you better drop some extra cash and upgrade to a more powerful machine.\n\n(I also want to note for those of you not familiar with the differences between Chromebooks, Windows, and Macs... this is just a large Android phone that can't make calls. If you can't do something on your phone, you can't do it on this. I've already run into not being able to open certain PDFs [ones with signature fields and such] with the error message from Adobe \"you require Windows or Mac\".\nFurthermore, because Android isn't as uniform as Mac iOS, I've run into apps that work great on an Android phones, but are rubbish on this chromebook because it's just not optimized for it.)"}

The ability of this computer to drop and walk away as I looked in a box at my broken Apple Air that I dropped never to use again. Excellent finger and typing control, good picture, good sound for schoolwork, not surround sound or anything for movies, but this is for school and it still works for movies. I have another expensive computer that was fried out when a Mike's Lemonade was spilled over it. This one takes the spills without damage, just wipe up and work on. Of course my son will only be drinking regular lemonade, but spills are part of growing up. If he loses it, bummer, but for the low cost can also take that in stride. The 180 degree opening also gives him every angle to work on a bus, at home, anywhere and its compact enough not to weigh down the backpack at just 2.6 lbs.

Whereas Google Chrome browser might be a minor app on a Windows or Apple computer, Google Chrome is the entire reason for the Chromebooks existence. Web browsing is the one thing which the Chromebook does really well because its OS is little more than a souped up version of Google Chrome web browser. Other applications can be downloaded, but at best your selection is limited to that of an Android phone. If you want to browse the web then Chromebook is for you. If you want to use it for anything else get an actual computer.\n\nAlso printing is an unbelievable chore to set up and is in some cases impossible.

After my first year I wanted to try a Chromebook again so I bought the same one that my high school had let me use and I was impressed. I have found that my Chromebook is more reliable than my Windows laptop because my Chromebook is always working fully and it has no issues so far. Chromebooks are much more simple and have a lot less settings than a Windows computer which makes it harder to accidentally mess it up. Windows computers can take over an hour to reinstall Windows while it takes no more than five minutes to reset a Chromebook.

However, If you plan to actually use the \"ruggedized\" features, think again.\n\nAfter less than a year of problem free use, I dropped the book about 2 feet onto a small table, landing screen first onto an xbox controller.  The screen went black, though the device stayed powered on. There was no physical damage to the screen or the bezel. As the product was still under warranty, I called Asus and was told that because I had caused the damage, I would have to foot the bill (Estimated $125-$200 w/ labor) and I would have to pay for postage both ways. That's about what I paid for the device to begin with! That doesn't sound right considering I bought a \"ruggedized\" chromebook with a 1 year warranty.\n\nI ended up buying a replacement screen on amazon (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IMCZVGA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and installed it myself. It was a breeze to do and the screen is arguably better than the original. I'd recommend this over going through Asus' joke of a customer service department.\n\nFrailty aside, it's actually a decent device as far as performance is concerned. The chromebook layout is intelligently designed and intuitive. The processor is fast  and memory is sufficient. Those features are ultimately why I decided on 3 stars instead of 2.\n\nIf you are buying this laptop with the intention of having it sit on a desk forever, then this is the book for you.

But believe it or not, I still get hung up on curent techology from time to time. With that being said, I think I have a good feel for what is worthwile in the tech area.  I can say, this is a good buy. I have to preface it however as what do you plan to do with it. If you plan on video editing, this is no good. If you want to watch videos, this is great. If you want to play fortnite, this will not be any good. If you want to play farmtown on facebook, this will work great.  Its an excellent little laptop, that really isn't a laptop, but behaves a lot like one.  one of my kids uses this for her homework, and it is perfect. Her school books this year are all on line. The school provides office 365 for the kids. She brings it to school with her everyday, and she is very happy. Most of her friends all have a chromebook, and everyone says they like hers the best. This one is very sturdy and feels firm in your hands. The keyboard has a great feel - when you press keys, it has a nice click to it. Requires a good amount of pressure to type, but not too much. The battery life is great, easily lasts the entire day. Not heavy at all, its easy to carry around all day. For a teenager, its absolutely perfect. It is rugged, and water resistant, and somewhat immune to viruses.  Admittedly, we are big time Google users. We have had a gmail accounts for years and we use all the wonderful products - Drive (docs, sheets, slides, and drawings), Voice (both phone and sms), Hangouts, Keep, Calendar, etc - that google has. If you're like me in this you'll be very happy to see that this Chromebook is a natural extension of your blissful Google experience. However if I had to say anything negative, to me personally it almost looks like a toy.  More like fisher price or a leap frog, rather than an Apple of HP. So if you are a business proffesional and would have a hangup on something like that, you may want to consider a different style. But for functionality and price, you really can't beat it.  Here is one tip for you, if you have never used Chrome OS before One thing I would strongly recommend is that you explore the help (?) section soon after you start it up for the first time. This is a Chrome OS so its slightly different than a Mac or Windows OS and will take a little getting used to. It's very intuitive and user friendly but you'll save yourself a lot of frustration if you take an hour to learn how to use it.\n I am considering buying a second one for me. This is what I plan on doing. I am sure you could install Ubuntu on it, and get myself a 64gb sd card, and I will have a fully functioning Linux computer.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "NOT FOR CHILDREN! My husband and I bought this Chromebook for our 9-year-old son for homework. One of the main reasons we chose it was because the parental controls were advertised as wonderful, and the computer was described as super easy to use. After spending *hours* researching the parental controls feature, we figured out that Google removed their monitoring program a while ago, and they haven't replaced it. The only controls available are through Google Family, and these only allow some internet filtering. Outside apps that have more monitoring options are not compatible with the Chromebook. So if I want to make sure my son is completely safe, I have to be with him at all times while he is using it, and physically lock it up when he is not to use it!\n\nNot to mention that the Chromebook doesn't work with printer drivers, so it's complicated to set up printing too.\n\nI am very disappointed with our Chromebook, and would NOT recommend it for families with children. A regular laptop would have been much easier to manage."}

I do realize that Chromebooks are designed to be used online; however, some reviewers indicated that they were able to work on documents saved locally to the computer when WiFi was not available and then sync to the cloud later.  I did not find that to be the case, even for relatively short documents  (up to 5000 words) due to the extremely long  lag time while the document was saving locally on the computer.  I found that I could only type a few sentences before the Chromebook would freeze for up to four minutes while the work saved - and this happened frequently, probably every other paragraph.\n\nI am quite disappointed since I do need to work offline a lot and, clearly, cannot do so with this Chromebook - I do not know if all Chromebooks are this way or if it is just this brand but I would not have purchased had I known..that said, I do think it is a nice little Chromebook as long as you do not need to work offline.

The reason I wanted a chromebook was for the battery life and simple light design. This chromebook has a very long battery life I use it during school and work and usually only charge it once or twice a week at most. I use it usually max to almost max brightness and it lasts all day and I don't have to worry about needing to plug it in all the time.\n\nLightweight and compact: It is lightweight and compact and I barely feel it when I put it in my bag or on my lap. I hold it in my hand with ease. At work I don't even need use it on a desk, just on my lap because it's small and comfortable enough. Furthermore, the ruggedized design makes it really protected, yet the thing is so light, I feel very safe if I were ever to drop it mostly because it doesn't weigh like other laptops. The ruggedized design, is strong I'm sure, but it's more like icing on the cake.\n\nSpeed and processor: I have no issues with speed and opening multiple windows whatsoever. It handles multiple open windows no problem, which I was worried about when I read other reviews. It was almost never lagged on me except once or twice when I opened a big e-textbook with hundreds of pages. It actually starts up and opens programs f*cking fast. I turn it on and it's fully on within a couple seconds. It doesn't seem to need to load ever which I am still am in shock about.

It's not horrible as there is a lot of child friendly content that can be accessible from the browser but it would be better if some apps could be installed.  The child cannot access YouTube as it redirects to a YouTube Kids page that requires the app, however the app cannot be installed on the Chromebook at this time."}

The fact that Google disabled all of their parent controls is a major concern, but that's for another review. Our daughter was very careful with the Chromebook and never dropped or damaged it, but within 8 months, the screen started flickering and then stopped working altogether. We returned it via ASUS warranty specifications, which don't allow you to actually to talk to anyone or contact anyone via email. We received an email saying that the plastic piece covering the hinge came loose and we have to pay $130 (after paying to ship the computer back for repair ourselves) to have that plastic piece repaired. Considering that the computer was bought for $200, I don't want to shell out over $150 to receive back a used computer! It is clear that this is a racket. I was given no phone number I could call, no email, and no way to resolve it. Either pay the $130 or we ship it back unrepaired. DO NOT buy ASUS chromebooks. I will never do so again."}

I recommend spending a little bit more money for something that's functional."}

Not ASUS's fault of course... But then this second one is delivered and... didn't work.\n\nThis was certainly just a single bad unit. I could've, and probably should have, contacted ASUS to get everything straightened out, but I was a bit frustrated at this point, and just went out that night and picked up a different laptop at a local Big Box.\n\nI was able to send the frozen one back to Amazon for a quick and courteous refund."}

Bought this primarily for my kids, and it's turned out to be an excellent family purchase that we all use.  If  we didn't have a  need for some software that requires Windows, I'd be 100% done with Microsoft in this house and stick with my Mac for real work and Chromebooks for kids/family use from now on.  Bottom line: this is a really strong choice if your kid/family use is primarily web-centric (email, web sites, video, etc.), if you don't need to install much software (e.g. you are happy to use web-based email, Google Docs and Google Slides rather than MS Word and Powerpoint, etc.), and you don't need to store a lot on your hard drive (e.g. you aren't saving tons of music files, video, photos, etc., or you keep them in the cloud)."}

This little Asus Chromebook just doesn't have the processing power to handle day-to-day activities. The other big letdown is that the screen resolution is horrid.

It's clear, but the speakers really are in a WEIRD spot.\n\nCharge: It really does hold a charge as long as the specs claim. I charge it once every three or four days.\n\nConclusion: EXCELLENT auxiliary laptop. Because it doesn't have a hard drive you CANNOT save things onto it and you cannot use large programs like photoshop, etc. If you have a full time student I'd make sure they had access to a desktop or normal laptop.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "We are a large family with all boys.  Therefore, quality is EXTREMELY important to us.  This Ruggedized Chromebook gets high marks from us!\nI spent a lot of time researching and comparing the various Chromebooks available and selected this one.  I knew that I wanted an Asus.  Then I compared the various Asus models.  This \"Ruggedized\" version was about $20 more than another one I was considering.  Ultimately I chose this one and am so glad that we did.  We have all boys.  Items get a lot of wear and tear.  The keyboard is waterproof, although as of yet we haven't needed to test that.  I like that the bottom has a bit of grip to it, so the device doesn't slide around easily.  We have Netflix on the bar at the bottom and our 3-year-old has easily figured out how to access his favorite show all by himself.  We bought this item to reduce wear and tear on my personal laptop.  The Chromebook is used for Netflix (we use the HDMI port and connect to our TV), internet browsing, etc.  We love this purchase so much that we have it in our cart and plan on purchasing another one."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "The laptop itself is amazing. It runs well and the ruggedized texture and look is definitely worth paying a little extra for. It feels great to hold and use. The only thing I would say holds the laptop back is the chromeOS. If this came with no OS or something like Linux Mint or Ubuntu it would be absolutely perfect. But the chromeOS makes doing a lot of things a hassle. Its possible to replace the OS but its a really big pain and probably not something the majority of users would be able to do comfortably. The only good thing about the chromeOS that I liked was how quickly it turns back on. But thats only because the laptop never really fully turns off. It just goes into a sort of sleep/standby mode. With that said I'd hate to give this laptop anything less than a 5/5 because the laptop itself is really high quality and even though the chromeOS isn't the best it still is doing the job I needed it for.\n\nPros\nLight and portable.\nQuick to turn on. (Because it never fully turns off)\nGreat for just browsing the internet or watching/streaming video.\nHas a great look and feel to it. Good build quality.\nFairly easy to take apart.\nThe mouse takes a little getting used to but once you do get used to it its a very good mouse.\n\nCons\nPretty much all of the cons are to do with the chromeOS\nPoor compatibility with software. (You are limited mostly to google playstore apps unless you want to really work hard to install things.)\nComputer never fully turns off. (Both a pro and a con)\nHave to take the computer apart and void the warranty just to get full control of the device.\nVery small amount of storage space. (I ended up buying a small low profile flashdrive and use that for storage)\n\nIf you are just going to use this as a laptop to browse the internet on or maybe do some banking on its the perfect laptop. If you had other plans I'd highly recommend getting a laptop that has windows installed even if you want to later install a linux OS its far easier to do that from windows than it would be from chromeOS."}

However, it's great for taking to school because it's so small and light. Great for anything on the internet, and even possible to do a little coding in the Chrome shell. Since Chrome is built on top of Linux XFCE, it's actually pretty easy to revert the system to Linux and be able to switch back and forth between Chrome and Linux. I can't use it quite like a desktop and I don't have a cloud-capable printer which sucks, but it's great for on the go. No regrets."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "I don't normally take the time to write a review on products we purchase but these turned out to be pretty good chromebooks. We purchased these based on a review site listing better laptops to purchase for the 2016 Christmas season. My kids are in the 8/10 range now. They were disappointed the laptops were not touch screen but I wasn't going to pay much more for a touch chromebook. My kids use these chromebooks all the time. Now that there is the android emulation/google play store to add all the android apps/games it has been even more enjoyable for the kids. I wanted the 4gb model to help future proof the devices compared to the basic 2gb chromebooks available. Well my kids have tested the durability of these devices. My son's was dropped a couple of feet and the video screen would not even light up yet the chromebook would work with an external monitor. I sent the unit off to ASUS repair and they quickly repaired and returned the unit. It worked fine for awhile then it was bumped again and the video went out again. I am computer savy so I decided to open up the chrome book myself and look at the cable from the motherboard to the screen. I believe the cable to the screen connection can disconnect pretty easily. I was able to get the video working again. My daughter decided to rip off several keys on hers. I see there are replacement keyboards available on e bay for pretty cheap and it looks fairly simple to replace.  Hopefully this review helps some other people. These are good devices that have a certain amount of ruggedness but they can still be mistreated. I would recommend this chromebook to others."}

The ONLY con to this product is that the keyboard doesn't light up - something I'm used to on my MacBook - but it doesn't seem to bother my son."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "Bought this computer to use as a portable service manual resource for a team of 3-4 mechanics. It is generally taken by a mechanic to a vehicle to look up procedures, torque specs, or circuit diagrams and so it ends up in weird places and gets lots of grease and dirt all over it (fortunately we have a silicone cover for our keyboard) and has dropped off of a lifted car onto concrete. When I need to clean it, I just spray a little brake parts cleaner on the cover and wipe it off. It's ridiculous. We could probably run over this thing and it'll still work.\n\nThe only issue I've ever had with it is when it was sat on top of the ignition wires of a running engine (they're generally at around 5-10kV) to bring up a diagnosis procedure or something, the touchpad didn't like it and stopped responding for a week. After that, continued working great for a couple months before someone did it again. But another week later and it's like it never happened.\n\nI can't imagine any other laptop surviving such utter brutality and still be perfect after the 8-9 months we've had it."}

I bought this because I was tired of windows 10 I hate it so bad, and couldn't bother with buying an apple laptop $$.\nLet's just start with the bad, because why not?\n\nI bought this pint sized device less than 6 months ago and it's already acting up. The random black outs mid task are driving me up a wall (although it takes less than a minute or two to reboot itself) no one should have to deal with that. Also, sometimes it will freeze if I'm watching a video followed by the loading circle \"not responding\" icon, that's fun too. I'm not one of those Internet users with tons of tabs or apps open 24/7 so I don't understand the crashes.\n\nThere isn't a designated caps lock button, it is replaced with a search button instead... something that I personally do not care to ever use! On the bright side, it can be tweaked into being a caps lock button in the settings thankfully. (Random: there is no number keys on the right side either, just your designated numbers on the top row of the keyboard, it's compact so that's understandable...)\n\nIf you're used to using a larger laptop, you will fall into the habit of hitting the screen lock/power button instead of the backspace button.... Slow blink. You'll eventually get used to it though.\n\nIt's a notebook, so don't assume that you can download anything (software etc) or use this bad boy for music storage and photo albums because you cant. Well you can, but you won't be able to open it obviously. It's not readable.  For an example, If you transferred a music album from your phone to this note book, you will not be able to open the file. It's not a real con, it's just a heads up. Crome books are strictly web based.\n\nNo back light for the keyboard,  don't bother with the late night typing, you won't be able to see.\n\nThe HDMI port is hit or miss. Sometimes it connects and recognizes my tv as a secondary display,  and other times its like \"meh... nah\"\n\nIt's a matte plastic display, so its not the brightest, or sharpest visual wise.\n\nWell if that stuff doesn't steer you away then go for it. The battery life is pretty good, charges fast... it's portable with rubberized edges so it has a better shot at surviving a drop. Usb and 3mm headphone port all there. The speakers are good enough, and it updates regularly. I personally won't recommend this crome book though."}

The school has started to require it as now they have gone to a system where all the schoolwork is posted and submitted via Google Classroom.  I could go on about that but this is about my experience with Amazon and Asus. On the first day of my son using the Chromebook, the LCD screen experienced minor shock while being carried in its case in a back pack.  This is on top of the description of it being ruggerdized. My laptop gets way more banged up and its screen has never broke. As a result the LCD screen was displaying a bulls eye black hole normally associated with impact or shock.  Since we bought it in July and our sons first day of school was at the end of August, Amazon said they could not help us.  So I went to Asus and they said the warranty does not cover the LCD screen but could fix it for the same price I bought it for. I should have gotten the insurance I guess. My point being is this chromebook is not as rugerdized as it claims to be and its LCD panel is vulnerable to damage even while being carried in a case and Amazon or Asus will not  help you out. I ended up having to get another chromebook for our son as its impossible to complete homework and classroom assignments at his school with out one.

Amazon is great about returns on defective stuff so they sent another.  However, I'm not sure if it was a lemon or the product is just low quality.  I will see after the next one.  Otherwise, it would be better if the keyboard was illuminated or at least glow in the dark.  I like the rugged features.  This my first experience with Chromebooks and I like the fact that they are easy to use.  I dislike the lack of hardware control (I could not diagnose the touch pad problem for lack of utility software).  The units are like dumb-terminals that are disposable.  I also dislike the lack of sufficient parental controls but that is an Amazon issue, not Asus.  Parental controls need the ability to give the child access to a limited list of applications and an app shopping experience that is based on parental ratings so nothing that is inappropriate is available in the shopping experience.  As it is, the parental controls completely locks the kid (supervised user) out of the majority of functionality - even email.  The parental controls should also offer the ability to remotely lock out and shut down the computer as well as operation times it is allowed to function."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "Great Chromebook! Bought as a replacement for my Lenovo Ideapad 310, AMD A12, 8GB Ram.\n\nThe main reason for the replacement was battery life. Only getting 2-3 hours on the Lenovo, I needed something that could handle my digital nomad lifestyle.\n\nPROS:\n\nBattery Life - You can easily get 8-9 hours with moderate usage.\nPerformance - I was a tad bit concerned with this factor, but with:\n\n----- 21 tabs open\n----- Keypress Editior (coding app from Chrome Store)\n----- Webserver for Chome (running a local server for web dev, from Chrome Store)\n----- Box SVG (creating & editing vector graphics app from Chrome Store)\n----- Polarr (a really good image editior from Chrome Store)\n----- Enjoy Music Player (another Chrome Store app)\n\nI haven't experienced any significant slow downs. Opening large SVG files or any other larger file, slows the system for a second or two (acceptable).\n\nKeyboard - I love typing on this keyboard. Even though it's smaller than my Lenovo, I type faster. Keys are well spaced and feel good to press. Also the key font size is a small aesthetic that you'll appreciate.\n\nBuild Quality - I won't lie, it's ugly, but it feels very solid in hand. I'm not moving it around like it's a new born baby, as I was with my Lenovo. I can quickly take it out my backpack and slap it on a desk. All the ports feel strong and sturdy. My flash drive does not wiggle while inserted.\n\nScreen - It's good for the price, nice matte finish. I haven't had the urge to go back to my Lenovo (15.6) to watch a video or movie. It gets bright and dim to my satisfaction, nuff said.\n\nCharge Time - A fast charging device wasn't on my feature list, but this baby is fully charged from 35% in less than 1 hour. Better than my lenovo...I'll take it.\n\nTrackpad - It does what I expect and is perfectly placed. My only gripe is how loud actual clicks are, everyone at Starbucks will know when you double-click.\n\nChrome OS - FYI, I'm coming from Ubuntu Desktop. From a bird's eye view Chrome OS may seem limited, but once you dig around the Chrome Store, you'll start finding apps for all your problems and fairly decent app replacements. Furthermore, there are a plethora of web apps outside the Chrome Store to compensate most people's unique necessities.\n\nChrome OS + Google Play - In my opinion these two paired eliminate the \"OS Limits\". If you ever used Android, then you'll know there's an app for everything. I personally haven't even needed the Play Store yet, so I actually disabled it.\n\nStorage - I thought this would be an issue, but Google Drive is integrated very well. You get 120GB free for 2 years. You can also expand your local memory with SD card or flash drive. I always keep a flash drive backup.\n\nSpeakers - As you can tell, I'm not super picky. These speakers get the job done, better than my Lenovo. I don't find myself plugging in my headphones to hear things better as I do with my phone and laptop. They get loud enough for me.\n\nWifi - This was another huge issue I had with my Lenovo, mainly because I was using linux. Asus definitely delivers, connections are always strong and never drop. I'm using this Chromebook in the same locations as I did with the Lenovo.\n\nBluetooth - I couldn't get it to connect with my phone. The pair would instantly drop. I haven't looked for a solution. I sure a bluetooth mouse or headset will work. It's well documented that not all phones pair with Chromebooks.\n\nWeight & Portability - It's nice and small, easy to carry around in hand as well as light on the back. Has a great rubber strip on bottom, that not only holds grip on tables and laps better than any other laptop I've owned, but allows it to be carried around like a spiraled notebook.\n\nLove Factor - It may be ugly, but I just love using it. It can do more than my phone and suitably replaces my laptop. Easy to carry around, not fragile, well built. It's the perfect piece of technology to augment yourself.\n\nOverall:\n\nBattery Life = 10\nPerformance = 9\nKeyboard = 10\nBuild Quality  = 10\nScreen = 8\nCharge Time = 10\nTrackpad = 8\nChrome OS = 9\nStorage (cloud) = 10\nSpeakers = 8\nWIFI = 10\nBluetooth = no contest\nWeight & Portability = 10\nLove Factor = 10\n\nTOTAL  122/130  (excluding bluetooth)\n\n--------------------------------  94% Chance I think you'll like this Chromebook"}

It's nice and light, but doesn't feel cheap, and the weight is balanced well.  The rubber bumper on the bottom serves several purposes - non-slip on tables, elevates it a little for a more comfortable typing angle, and gives you a little handle when holding it with one hand. The battery life is excellent - in the month I've been using it I don't think I've seen a low battery warning.  I throw it on the charger every few days out of habit, but not having to worry about the battery dying is nice. What I think really sets this apart form other chromebooks is the keyboard. The keys have really nice \"travel\" to them and it's a pleasure to type on. Highly recommend."}

So far, this sturdy little Chromebook has met all his needs: access to his documents and presentations for school, his school e-mail and the occasional web browsing. I like the substantial keyboard, which makes it harder for my son to make mistakes when typing; the rugged design is also a plus. The battery life right now is excellent and I hope we never get to test this Chromebook's water resistant keyboard. All this for under USD 200 (when I bought it here at Amazon, but I could see that the price has now increased). This was a really good buy.\n\n[EDITED]: We bought this Chromebook for our son because we liked the Supervised Users feature - only to have Google pull out support for it this January 2018.

The battery life is great, the keyboard is comfortable and easy to use, the screen is pretty vivid, and for web browsing it's difficult to tell the difference between this Chromebook and my primary laptop, which cost five times more. Basically, if that's all you plan to use this for--YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, anything you can access in a web browser--it's a five star product hands down.\n\nThe problem is everything else: once you're away from the Internet it becomes a $200 brick. If you plan on doing any kind of document or spreadsheet, you need to go through Google Docs. Assuming it works perfectly, you need to wait about 20 seconds between clicking to open a document and actually being able to edit it. Sometimes it doesn't work perfectly, you need to log back into your account. Sometimes you try logging in and it doesn't work for some reason. Then it completely freezes, so you need to close Chrome and try again. Then you finally get logged into Google Docs, you start writing your document and have a bad Internet connection for whatever reason. The second the Internet is gone, your document is frozen--can't change anything, can't copy or paste anything, nothing. Sometimes it does this even when the Internet connection doesn't seem to be suffering any problems. There's supposedly an \"offline mode,\" which stops that from happening. but only for one of your devices at a time, and after hours of effort I could not get it to work with this thing in any case.\n\nIn one instance, between me opening Google Docs it took a full FIVE minutes of clicking and dealing with problems before I could get access to a document I needed--and that was on a good Internet connection.\n\nOnce it actually works it's great, the problem is getting to that point."}

Great battery life, fast operating system, fast processor, fast connections, all in a lightweight tough machine.  I have had no problems so far. It is a joy to use.\n\nBuyers should be told in clear terms that a 16 Gb machine such as this will have 8 Gb of usable memory available.  The operating system takes up about 8 Gb.  This is easily accommodated with an SDHC card, and I was aware I would have to purchase memory.  But no one mentioned that operating system gobbles up 50% of the machine's memory.\n\nMy expectations were totally met by this machine.  I never thought I could get Apps from the Google Play Store - those are for android machines... However, Google is working to make Apps available and this machine is in \"Beta\" for Apps. Had I realized this, I might have spent a little more, or looked at other machines that already have Google apps available.\n\nPlease do not take this as criticisms of this machine, its just information.  The Asus C202SA is well worth the money, and only will get better with implementation of the Google Play connection. I would buy it again.\n\nUpdate: August 24, 2017\n\nThe latest update of Chrome Operating System included the ability get and run Apps from the Android App Store.  Many Apps are available, but not all of them as some developers are not ready.  But, now that I have it, I'm not sure why I was so excited about getting this feature. I checked every App I have on my Phone, and it is just as easy using them from a Chrome web page as it is from an App. It is nice having a separate icon and a single click, but the App and the Web page are equally suited for my use."}

She also uses it to explore appropriate YouTube channels and is becoming very good at using computer programs. One downside is that there is a key on the keyboard that is not functioning properly. She was afraid I would return the Chromebook so she didn't tell me about it until I asked her about it over dinner. Basically, one of the punctuation keys does not work and needs to be hit three or four times before working.  She has figured out a workaround to avoid using this key. I wish the keyboard worked normally so she wouldn't have to do that. It is still under warranty so I may return it for a working keyboard but not sure yet because my daughter would be upset with me if I take it away. Besides this issue, she is really enjoying the Chromebook."}

My wife and i have different profiles so we can customize.  It connected to my printer pretty well but that could have been a little easier.  I had to manually manipulate some settings that would be difficult for some people.  The screen is bright and clear and battery life is great.  I would guess because i haven't tested, that the battery would last 8 to 10 hours."}

I thought there would be more of a learning curve when typing on smaller computers but it seems to fit my hands comfortably (although I am a pretty small girl). The loading time on this computer is outstanding; fastest I've ever had and I usually run about 11.34 MBPS which is not very fast so I am impressed with it's loading speed. It is small, lightweight, and I can't wait to use it for my college classes. I've never worked with a chromebook before, and I was expecting more computer components. Everything is done through an app and opens up in chrome. There are no other functions you can really do, so forget downloading other computer programs. The settings are still pretty customizable but still more limiting than a laptop. I also have a few problems opening up some pages on the Chromebook. For an example it sees amazon.com as one of the harmful sites and I get a page telling me to turn back. When I go to the advanced settings to overwrite it, it loads up amazon as a page that looked like a child created in the 1990s.\nOverall I am quite happy with my purchase and I can definitely see it's efficiency in it's purpose for my college uses."}

Chromebook seamlessly integrates Google Docs, and most other important apps into the framework of the little machine, so it's very easy to use and get started. The offline stuff is very useful too as I'm not always in a place where there's wifi and I can still work on my books.\n\nAnother nice feature is how light it is.

Including Google docs, Google Drive, Youtube, Rabbit. TV, Discord, GMAIL, Twitter, and Database pages which range from 3-5 tabs depending on what info I need at the time. They are not exaggerating on the ruggedness of this chromebook, I have dropped it/ hit it against the table/chair around 10 times and it looks brand new still, the screen gets dirty more often than I would like but nothing a simple micro fiber cloth can't fix. The screen is one of the weak spots of the chromebook but for under 200 US Dollars and the toted Water Resistance Keyboard it gets a pass. This has been perfect for my specific needs which can be all done within the chrome browser. One thing to keep in mind is more and more chromebooks, this particular model as of this review is in the beta channel for getting the Google Play Store which will open up the usability of this chromebook tenfold with more than a million apps going to be available, including productivity apps the Play Store includes. If you want a reliable Chromebook you truly can't go wrong with the C202SA. If they ever make a model of this with a 1080p screen this would be a perfect chromebook for me."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "I purchased my ASUS Chromebook when after having shoulder surgery I realized that it was impossible for me to lift the gaming laptop I purchased to keep me occupied for the six weeks I would be recuperating with the use of only one arm.  After 3 weeks of nothing but Netflix and Amazon Prime and fighting with the kids over the Ipad I decided I would look into a cheap alternative to my laptop.  This ASUS wasn't steep in price and I figured I can just give it to the kids to use once I am back to life.  I had heard about Chromebooks being slow and limiting but that could not be further from the truth.  The SPEED IS FAST!  I don't notice any difference between the Chromebook and other laptops I have used in the past and that is when I have up to five or six (or more) tabs open.  True you can't use software such as Microsoft Word or Office which makes it possible to do work off line but with Google docs that really doesn't bother me.  I have wifi at home and I'm not going anywhere when I can't even brush my own hair.  Honestly almost everywhere you might want to do some work online there is free wifi available.  Movie streaming is working just great.  I have noticed that it has taken a little longer for some video on youtube or Buzzfeed to load but not enough to be a problem.  Another real benefit of this Chromebook is the size and ease of use.  I have the use of only one hand right now with the exception of having a few minutes per day while doing \"exercises\" with my arm,(which is why I can type this review!).  This Chromebook is as easy to lift and carry around with one hand as the Ipad and it is no problem with getting the top open with just one hand.  This little thing is tough and I don't feel any give as if I were tensing the hinges when pulling open the top like I would on my old laptop.  It doesn't sway or bend or feel cheap at all.  The rubber grip around the edges also makes me feel more at ease with moving it around all day and opening and closing it.  The very biggest surprise though has come from the keyboard.  I love to write and have had a really hard time with hand and wrist pain when typing on a flat keyboard as opposed to mechanical.  With this the KEYBOARD IS FANTASTIC FOR TYPING!  The keys have a clean click and I can type much faster than on the horrible keyboard of my old Toshiba Satellite.  The keyboard is smaller than a larger computer but the only key I have noticed missing is the caps lock. I have read some complaints about the touch pad but I have had no issues with it whatsoever.  So, would I buy it again? In a heart beat. In fact I wish I had known how great a $200.00 little laptop could be. And it is like a small laptop and nothing like a tablet with a keyboard."}

The screen is pretty small, I'm wondering if a 13 inch would be good. But, I love the idea of no built in obsolesence as in the macs, in about 4 years, you have to get a new one as it will no longer take the security upgrades. that's a lot of money for me at their price point. Downside to some chrome computers is you have to have a printer that is google cloud enabled. (Mine is an older brother printer, so I can't print with the Acer I have.) I think this Asus will accept the printer, but haven't tried yet.  Long battery life. I installed https everywhere, as instructed for additional security.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "I've been a Chromebook fan since 2015. Many people writing reviews on Amazon about their frustrations with certain Chromebooks are almost entirely confused about-- or unfamiliar with-- the OS, so they take it out on the machine. That's not fair or accurate.\n\nBy way of background, I also need to explain that I bought a pair of ASUS C100PA-DB02 10.1-inch Chromebook flips with touchscreens back in 2015. They have very glossy/shiny screens which glare, but the touch screen feature is nice. They also feature an actual aluminum metal chassis which is very elegant and classy looking (although prone to scratches).\n\nI saw this \"ruggedized\" version of a Chromebook on Amazon and thought I'd pick one up. I'm already an Asus fan, I like the Chromebook OS, and I was looking for a more durable Chromebook to literally throw in my backpack or briefcase and head out the door-- without worrying about a sleeve, case, or possible scratches if none of these was used.\n\nWell, this \"ruggedized\" version looks like it'd be great for children. Not so great for professional adults who've been spoiled with the nicer Chromebooks or laptops. I don't mean to be harsh because the chassis isn't awful, but it does have more of a look of Fisher Price or Leapfrog than Apple or PC.\n\nThe Screen: The screen on this laptop is dimmer and more grainy (of that makes sense) than my other two laptops (both my other Chromebook and a PC laptop). The screen is anti-glare to be sure (a good thing), but you can sort of see a matrix pattern on the screen (a bad thing). The colors are also ever-so-slightly more washed out and dull. I compared all the screens side-by-side. If you're a student or a parent buying this for a child in grade-school, I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you're a photographer, visual artist, or someone who with a keen eye who enjoys HD movies, you'll notice that this screen is simply not up to par with other laptops on the market.\n\nThe Keys: The keys on this laptop are my biggest frustration. While many keyboards today are back-lit, that would be a luxury on a Chromebook. Fair enough. But is it too much to ask for high-contrast silk screening? Maybe a phosphorescent or white print color for the keys? Apparently so. This keyboard has mid-to-dark-blue lettering on black keys. A really, really stupid choice that makes no scientific or practical sense other than to match the color blue to the \"ruggedized\" cover trim. These keys will be hard to see in low-lighting. Lastly, the keys on this keyboard are noticeably taller than on my other Asus Chromebook. Probably twice as tall. You feel like you're typing on a manual typewriter. Very poor design choice.\n\nSummary: If I were a parent, I'd buy my kid this laptop in a heartbeat. It's compact, durable, water-resistant, has excellent battery life, access to the Internet, if used with Google Drive and Google Docs all work is saved and backed-up automatically, the laptop is somewhat immune to viruses, and it's certainly rugged. However, if I were a college student and wanted all the above *plus* the ability to really enjoy streaming movies and to comfortably type-up term papers for hours on end, I'd probably get a Chromebook with a nicer screen and better keyboard. Sadly, for me, this laptop was a no-go and I'll be returning it. Sticking with the aluminum Asus 2-in-1 with touchscreen.\n\nIf you found this review, please give me a thumbs up. Cheers."}

Conducting troubleshooting by hard resets, draining battery and recharging, etc resulted in no change.  Attempted a return on Amazon, but the unit is only covered for returns for six months.  Had to contact ASUS, who issued an RMA.  Note -- there is a 12 month manufacturer's warranty from the time of purchase.  ASUS, however, requires you to pack and ship your own equipment to their repair facility.  You burden these costs, despite their faulty product.\n\nThe second unit works intermittently.  Being a \"net\"book, one would imagine the WiFi radio would be of good quality.  It is not.  The range is extremely limited, and the internet connection on the netbook side drops frequently.  I have a standard Dell laptop which experiences none of these challenges when placed in the same general area, connecting to the same sites/services.  I'd send the unit back for whatever repair might be done, but I fear the cost of shipping/handling is my burden per ASUS' policies.  That, and this isn't a break/fix issue -- it's a more likely the result of poor design and cheap hardware.\n\nSuffice it to say, we won't be purchasing from ASUS in the future."}

I could see it being perfect for older people that aren't tech savvy or young students- or for someone like me that wants something affordable, simple and that won't break with everyday use."}

I'm not crazy about working on the little touch pad, so I have a wireless mouse with mine. That's just my personal preference, though.

To give you an example:  I can't even use Google maps because the maps won't load.  I researched everything you are supposed to do to increase speed:  disabling unused extensions, not keeping too many tabs open, and disabling some plug-ins (which unfortunately Chrome no longer allows you to do).  I stopped short of a powerwash:  Why should I need to do that after I've had the computer a little over a month?  I suspect I may have gotten a faulty model and wish I could return it, but amazon's return policy is only 30 days.\n\nAn additional problem is that the battery life is quite poor--only a fraction of the advertised 10 hours.

This is a Chromebook and runs Chrome OS, which is primarily intended for web based computing. You cannot compare this to a Windows PC/laptop because it's completely different. If you educate yourself first to understand the software, functions, and limitations of the product, you can make an informed and wise purchase. As for me, I love it! It's a great compact size, is fast as lightning, runs Android apps (after switching the OS to the Beta channel) flawlessly, and works well with USB drives, memory cards, Bluetooth devices, and more. The lightweight footprint of the operating system is a plus because it boots and computes faster than most Windows laptops. The design of the device is rugged and feels very well made. In summary, I did my homework before I purchased so my expectations for it were realistic- and it has exceeded! I definitely recommend this device to those who understand what a Chromebook does and cannot do."}

It shipped to my apartment in less than two business weeks (the day before we left which is why I even gave it a two-star). Upon arrival, I had issues booting the start up screen and the computer refused to hold a charge for more than a minute. After a month of inactivity (due to deployment reasons), I was finally able to figure out what I needed and install the startup Chrome OS onto it in order for it to even turn on. After doing so, and while needing to stay plugged in while operating, the wake-up sensor refused to work leaving the laptop on and causing a short in the internal components. By the time I had realized that my hand was on fire from just touching it, it had worked down the entire left panel and melted all the plastic around the sensor, on the keyboard and down the side of the screen and even melted a small indention into the top; the other side of the computer! I tried to contact the company (which was to no avail) and the only thing they could suggest is to place in a well ventilated area.

I am not an easy person to please, and even harder to get me to heap praise on anything tech related, but this does all it says and more (if you're a geek/tech nerd). I have done my fair share of tech support for friends over the years, built over 6 gaming pc's for friends and myself, set up networks for law offices, etc. So believe me, I expect a lot from my devices. ASUS has always been a company I have a lot of respect for and usually creates very solid products. They did so yet again with this laptop. I ran it vanilla (original setup) for the first month and thought it was pretty great. But I am a power user, so I pretty quickly started figuring out how to get linux running, and OMG, what a different and even better system. This thing runs damn near anything I throw at it (within reason). No, it will not run the latest games...heck...it will struggle with games 10+ years old. But with linux installed I have run a PSP emulator (PPSSPP) along with an SNES, Genesis, turbo graphix, MAME, etc  almost flawlessly. It will happily work with Kodi, and play true high def (1080p) films (though obviously the screen cant show the full detail). On the note of the screen, its great in all sorts of lighting situations. The mate gloss may not be as clear as a shiny screen, but it sure does help in heavy light situations to still see what is going on on the screen.\nObviously I like it, and I really coudlnt be happier with my purchase. This is the first time in over 10 years that I have actually spent the money on a new system(though I have bought plenty used) and I can honestly say it was more than worth it.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "This is the first laptop I've seen in at least a decade that can be opened using the easy-to-find phillips head screws. They've made a super tough laptop that's actually possible to service without too many compromises on functionality. The screen and CPU speed is ok, and very good for this price point, the keyboard is great and the battery life is about 10 hours, depending on what you're using it for.\n\nWe're just using this one at home, but it has some nice little touches for use in a classroom like a spill proof keyboard and a light on the top of the case that shows if the wifi is connected. It also comes with a charger with a nice long cable and a standard coxial DC connector that's pretty rugged and would be easy to replace it if were broken.\n\nWould definitely recommend for kids, or anyone that just wants a useful, tough, super cheap laptop they won't have to worry about damaging."}

Many other computers take at least 2-3 minutes before I can do anything with them, but not this one! I can immediately get online and access documents without waiting or getting frustrated.\n\nThe speakers are pretty good for the size of the computer, nothing super loud or anything, but definitely good and clear sound.\n\nThe keyboard's letters are a light blue color and bigger than most other's. That does not make a very big difference to me, but it would help someone just learning how to use a keyboard or whose vision is not too great.\n\nI personally am not a huge fan of the touch pad because most of the time it is difficult or impossible to left click anything, but that was easily solvable by using a small, portable wireless mouse.\n\nIt does effortlessly keep track of social media notifications, especially Facebook, which is a good but not overall necessary feature, at least for me.\n\nIt has a good design and definitely would hold up to short distance drops or a little bit of water. I often take this to school and at times it sits in my hot car, but it always manages to work great when in use.\n\nMy favorite feature of this computer? The battery life. Hands down, the battery life on its own is unbeatable. It lasts at the very least ten hours and I can get anywhere from 3-5 days use on one charge. I no longer need to take my charger out with me and worry whether or not there is an outlet nearby."}

However, I had an issue just after purchasing it where it shut down several times randomly, and then froze, nearly preventing me from troubleshooting it (if you have the same issue, press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+R, then \"powerwash\" the device - your bookmarks will be saved, but I don't know about any data that isn't in the cloud since I haven't used it long enough to accumulate data or really learn what the device is capable of, and you will have to reset your wallpaper).  If that is a continuing trend, then we're going to have a problem.  I will add updates if the problem persists (this is an issue with the OS, so I worry about any corruption occurring with the device).  Asus technical support via live chat had it fixed in five minutes, and they were available within the same amount of time.  I'm very pleased with their support.\n\nI'd also like to add that this device has two USB drives; I'm using it to transfer photos from my Nikon to my Seagate external hard drive, since I don't want to buy multiple SD cards.  This is a feature I was unaware of at purchase, and I am glad it is there, as I would not be able to transfer my data to my Seagate without sending all of my photos to my Google Drive first otherwise (which would be a pain).\n\n~Happy Hunting!\n\nEdit:\nI received an email from someone who purchased my old chromebook \"new\" and asked me for my password to access it.

Occasionally, the computer would freeze up, and I would have to shut it down and log back in. Over time, this became more infrequent, but it still happened. One day, the laptop froze again, and I had to shut it down. When I turned it back on, the touchpad stopped working. I tried everything and the only solution was to use an extremely inconvenient mouse. However, there are some good things about the computer. Mainly, the overall design of the computer. It doesn't break as easily as other computers and bends back completely which was helpful, because the reason I had to get the new computer was that I lent it to someone, and they in anger, bend the computer back, breaking it. I am not sure if this happened to everyone, but it happened to me, and buy it knowing that this may happen."}

She likes the smaller size, lower weight and longer battery life compared to the big HP.  I have an Asus C200MA that I've had for a few years and use daily so I figured the C202SA would be a good choice.  It is indeed quite rugged and feels sturdy.  The keyboard has a good solid feel and I really like the protected edges.  The C202 works well for all of my daughter's school needs and she uses it for all of her classes. It seems fast and responsive and never lags when watching videos or streaming music. My daughter always has several tabs open with music streaming and who knows what else going on in the background and the C202 has never struggled to keep up. I ask her occasionally how she likes it and if everything is working well and she says it's working perfect and is quite happy with it.  I think as long as you know what a chromebook is, what it does well and what it does not, you'll be quite happy with the C202. I'm quite happy with this purchase and will buy one for myself for sure if my old trusty C200 ever needs to be replaced."}

I logged into my email and am shocked by the yellow flag:  Google mail is not supported by this browser.  Click here to upgrade.  I click and find that the update is not available to this Chrome OS.  What?  I check the tiny user manual with print so tiny that I can barely read it with a magnifying glass, and instead grab my small size 4X glass, which is needed to read the s/n on the back of the notebook.  I check the FAQ section:  Oops, no faq available, but the website assures me they update it regularly.  Again, WHAT?  According to ASUS there are no FAQs for the C202S and this device was made Feb 2, 2016.  Not exactly new.  I called Amazon customer service and let them know what's going on.  The rep offers to call Asus and in a moment I am speaking to an Asus tech help.  He doesn't quite believe what I am telling him, and suggests another way for me to get on the correct page for FAQs.  Same result, none.  He tells me that they are there on his monitor.  Not on mine, but then again the browser is not updated or supported (?).  We tried to install the Chrome OS, but then a Chromebook has no way to execute a bin file.\nYears ago I bought an Asus netbook in the spring, 7\" screen, tiny device.  I loved it until fall when they came out with the 8.9\" screen for $150.00 less!  I paid $400.00 for a netbook that was outdated by a much better cheaper netbook in six months.  This has nothing to do with today other than I felt screwed at the time.  And this brand new Chromebook is really an old device not currently supported by Google's newer software.  Asus can do better than this, but then they would have to care more about customers.  Thank you amazon for permission to return this product for a refund.  It is already at UPS.  I am. writing this review on Anker bluetooth keyboard with a Caps lock key which the Chromebook lacked.\n\nI really liked the build quality of Asus C202S but I have already had my fill of outdated Asus products.  Also these guys need to do better job of User Guide, maybe scale up the print size so it could be read with a normal magnifying glass.  Nice device, but no way am a I going to be duped twice."}

A drawback has been the nuisance websites that work their way in while other sites are being used, but Google Chrome help has taken care of that issue when it has happened. A great value.\n\nAfter using this Chromebook for a couple of months, I returned it to Amazon. Here are the limitations that I found. Using a simple program like Microsoft Word requires all sorts of adjustments to the Chromebook. It was difficult to figure out how to get the machine to work offline on Word. Downloading a video for later use was somewhat of a hassle, as the device needs to be online to play movies. Downloading music is also a hassle, but is possible. So, I finally returned it. The Chromebook might be great for students, or those who require only basic operations in using it, but it was not for me."}

For browsing, youtube, email, google docs, shopping, or anything you might want to do on the internet, this device is very comfortable. Sure the screen could have been a bit bigger but that would have probably been more money. So far we've bough 3 of these. At $159.00 a piece these are an incredible bargain. They have a very utilitarian look. I think they were going for the \"calculator\" look, which in my opinion is a great concept for this device. The charge lasts hours and the keys are big and have a nice feel. The rubber grips at the bottom are a really great feature. I attached a wireless mouse which worked right away without having to do any of that \"detecting your hardware... installing driver...\" etc that you need to do with Windows. So far my kids have used theirs for about 5 months with no issues and I just got mine a few days ago and so far so good.

Asus said the problem was not covered under warranty even though it had been used less than 30 days.  Amazon warranty took the device and after about a month refunded my money (which is disappointing since it was a black Friday deal and would now cost much more to buy one).

Then after two weeks someone tripped over the power cord while I had it plugged in on my desk and knocked it onto a plush carpeted floor and the screen cracked... a lot.\nI liked it well enough otherwise (except typing in low light is hard when you can't see the dark blue key labels/layout), but it was never truly useful for me."}

There isn't a significant amount of storage device on the system, but the Chromebook offers an SD memory card slot and Google Drive storage, which is more than enough for my uses (photos, videos, documents, etc.).\n\nThe battery life of this device blows me away - after a morning of light use, I'm at 81%, leaving me with roughly 5 hours and 45 minutes left remaining.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "This Chromebook hardly needs another review but I've just been so happy with it lately I thought I'd throw my two cents in here. *For a Chromebook* this device is fantastic. Of course it's limited in many, many ways, but that's the whole point of buying a Chromebook. I've been using this device for a little over half a semester in college for in class note taking, group work, etc. I use my desktop for any heavy duty stuff. It's worth noting that I rollerblade to classes, so I was looking for something as light as possible and as durable as possible.\n\nPros:\nVery sturdy - I've dropped it many times and the worst that has happened is the rubber edging will have to be popped back into place. Simple as that and it feels totally firm and solid once it's back in place. It's great to not have to treat your laptop like the slightest bump could damage it.\n\nFantastic keyboard - The keyboard has a nice \"chunk\" with each keystroke. The keys have enough travel and require enough force to avoid accidental keystrokes and typing feels great, even satisfying.\n\nGreat battery life - I never bring my charger with me anymore, no matter how long I expect to be out.\n\nGood sunlight readability -  The screen does a pretty fine job of reducing strong glare.\n\nCons:\nWeight - Though it's not particularly heavy for a Chromebook, its weight is a significant addition to my backpack. At just over two pounds, however, it's not a huge compromise in return for how durable this machine is.\n\nSometime slow - As you'd expect. But honestly Chrome does a good enough job of managing resources that I only notice severe lag when opening presentations with many elements in them.\n\nAll in all, this Chromebook has exceeded my expectations!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "Absolute junk. Third Chromebook, and by far the worst I've had. Maybe. Hard to tell really. After turning it on and doing the 13 minutes worth of updates I logged in and opened the gmail app. It said my version of Chrome wasn't supported. So, I updated Chrome using the Settings-About-Check for Updates. It downloaded and installed an update. Maybe. It's hard to tell because it hasn't quit restarting since then. I've literally seen only one webpage and that said it wouldn't work. Complete COMPLETE pain in the Asus.\n\nOh. I can turn it off and leave it off no problem. Turning it on and having it STAY on is, however, a problem. It really likes to reboot... a lot. Like it's got this one trick it can do and it's doing it over and over to impress me. Seriously, not impressed.\n\nSo, go download some sort of recovery tool on another computer, put it on a USB drive and see if THAT will fix the problem or just have me do more updates again and again and then it starts doing the reboot macarena on me again. Which would actually be fantastic. Come to think of it, it SHOULD play some annoying repetitive music to really get the full sensory buggery of the thing at maximum. Unfortunately, the app that is suggested by Google to fix the problem doesn't actually work. Nope. It spends half an hour downloading the restore package, unzipping said package, verifying said package, and then deciding that no matter what media I use by what company it's from, it will not work. I've tried three times, each time redownloading the thing and doing the whole stupid dance over and over again, WITH a chromebook, so it should work. It doesn't. It's like it is doing it on purpose, you know?\n\nI can't say enough bad things about this thing without using language that is probably not appropriate for an amazon review. You know all those words you're not supposed to say in polite company? Look at the image of this computer on your screen and say them now, softly, so nobody can hear you.\n\nThere, now you've got the full Asus Chromebook experience without flushing your money down the toilet like I did."}

While some complain that it looks like a \"kids\" laptop, it's actually quite rugged, and the keyboard and touchpad have a really good feel.  It's also very lightweight which is really nice for travelling.\n2.  The screen is very readable and has good brightness and low-glare\n3.  Though I've only been using it for a few hours now, it seems very responsive and a major upgrade over the older model.  WiFi speeds are excellent (depending upon your broadband connection of course)\n4.  Not enough time use yet to comment on battery life.\n\nRemember that this is a Chromebook and has it's limitations.  Don't expect to run Adobe Photoshop or transcode HD video.  However, for Email, web browsing, photo uploading and access to Google Docs, it's a great machine (also, plays spotify and Netflix quite well).  I hesitated a while before buying because I couldn't find one locally to look at, but I am glad I got it.  Great value.  Also, you get 100 GB of Google drive fress for 2 years, which can be handy."}

I enjoy working on this over my much more expensive phone or tablet obviously due to the larger screen and full keyboard. I use a 256gb SD card for additional storage with no problems except for my one and only major complaint and that is that the card slot is full SD not micro and the card sticks out from the side just a little bit. This drives me crazy, a 256gb card isn't cheap and I'm constantly worried about accidently ejecting it or breaking it. Also to keep cost down Asus used a cheap screen, this causes the screen to be black or very washed out from  any angle other than straight on viewing, most lower cost chrome books use a similar screen though. Full HDMI port is great extending or mirroring your screen to a TV. Biggest plus is Google docs/Google Drive allow me to start a project on here then pickup from my phone, tablet or Pc, even Microsoft docs convert with no problems. I may use this for my kids and get the Samsung chrome book 3 for me only because of the faster processor and that it has a micro SD slot that holds the card recessed into the chrome book for my everyday carry device. keep in mind this is a much more rugged device though."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "I have not received the unit yet, I'll update the rating when I've used the unit for awhile, but here is some useful info.\n\nIf you are interested in the 'fixability' of the unit, a site called IfixIt has a complete disassembly of an Asus C202 with pictures -- nothing is glued together, all you need are a couple small phillips screwdrivers and the ubiquitous plastic cell phone case pry tool.  Looks easy to repair/replace parts to me.\n\nI like to look over a user manual BEFORE I buy tech, but if you search for 'Asus C202 manual' all you will find is a .pdf of a single sheet like they package with a watch.  However, searching for 'Asus C300 Chromebook User Manual' leads to a site dicdnet.asus.com with a .pdf  \"Notebook PC - E-Manual for Chromebook\" dated April 2014, which although using the C300 model as an example is actually a 90 page general Asus Chromebook user manual.\n\nI'm sure a specific (and possibly more recent) manual will come pre-installed on the C202 but if you want some pre-purchase info here you go.\n\nUPDATE 3/15/17:  Received unit but so far not so great.\nFirst, they say to let unit charge for at least 3 hours before using it.  Now my guess is, if I just left it plugged in I could use it after 10-15 minutes of initial charge, but I followed the directions and waited.  Then the unit said it had to upgrade to the latest version of Chrome -- OK -- and the progress bar said 30 minutes.  It still said 30 minutes about 5 minutes later, at which point I had to close the lid, wondering if that would turn the unit off or not.  Sure enough when I opened the unit an hour later I got the same 30 minutes to upgrade message so I closed the lid and went to bed.  About 12 hours later I got a chance to try again and this time the unit prompted me to sign in to my google email account - expected but we use long secure passwords on our email accounts, not the kind of password I want to type in every time I turn on a laptop.  I found out later that there is an option to log in as a guest which appears to be enabled by default, which may be the preferred method from a privacy point of view if the unit is physically secure, as long as you don't need to buy an app or do anything else tied to a specific google account.\n\nOf course the very first thing you want to do is go through all the settings and make sure all the security/privacy settings are what you want.\n\nOne thing I noticed right away was that I was missing Page Up / Page Down keys.  After finding a keyboard shortcut map I tried the key combinations for page up /page down, but they didn't work on Google's own help page -- only moving the cursor in the scrollbar worked.  This is not good to have no keyboard navigation.  I also noticed there is no delete key.  Now you can get that function via a two key press, but delete is such a much used function it should have it's own key -- with the confirming \"Are you sure..\" prompt enabled by default.\n\nMy conclusions so far:\nLong delay before intitial use.  Sure a Windows laptop would be similar (although the Windows update would occur in the background) due to security software updates and other software updates, but I did not expect any delay with a Chromebook.\n\nNeeds at least basic step - by - step startup instructions printed in the box.\n\nGoogle obviously thinks a Chromebook is a phone with a keyboard -- basic notebook features like options to set hat happens when you close the lid, and basic keys like pgup, pgdn, and del, limit functionality unnecessarily.\n\nHopefully actual use will prove more positive.\n\nUPDATE 3/16/17:\nThis review won't get past initial impressions as I will be returning the unit  it just didn't work out for me.  Im leaving my overall rating at 3 stars, though Asus gets 5 stars for great hardware design and execution.\n\n I like the Chromebook concept  a low power low heat generating processor combined with a small, efficient *nix operating system, but I think Google needs to move further past the hobbyist aspects, like having to use operating system flags to get basic functionality, or having to move beyond beta versions into canary developmental versions to catch up with what (at least my) expectations are now.  Then theres functions deserving dedicated keyboard keys  at least del, pgup, pgdn, forward and back, all of which can be half size keys so not a space issue.  Most importantly is a failure to provide .pdf documentation AND initial turn on step-by-step basic tutorial.  I get that Google wants to change things on a more or less continuous basis, so make the .pdf view only.  And on initial turn-on there should be a series of splash screens with what to do  sign in options, security/privacy options, basic keyboard/touchpad/storage/browser/etc. options   just like Windows.  Operating system updates should be followed by screens explaining any changes.\n\nSadly I cant recommend this for young folks school use if other options are affordable because the interface is different than the Windows/Mac equipment they will be using later.  Older kids who are ready to knowledgably multi-platform will find these fascinating, although not as fascinating as playing with full size *nix on a full size platform.\n\nFor many folks this inexpensive Chromebook will get the job done  I had no problem surfing and saving files.  Given another year of software development incorporating the suggestions above, and including relatively seamless incorporation of most Android apps, this Chromebook might get the job done for me, too.\n\nBy the way, as of March 16 2017 this unit did auto update to version 56, which does reportedly allow play store installation if you are willing to go out on a limb manually installing pre-beta software  but if you are waiting for formal OS support of play store apps progress is very slow."}

He needed something for basic web access and watching YouTube videos, this suits him fine and he likes that it doesn't get hot the way a laptop does. It is also much lighter than a laptop and the battery life is great. I have used it myself and it and am happy this is the one we went with."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "I actually hated this tablet but I must admit this is the first tablet I have owned. Perhaps all have less keys and complicated formulas just to delete and have three keys to press just to capitalize more than the first letter. I would have learned to live with these features thinking that these issues are possibly consistent on all tablets. But, I could not live with the fact that it is not an Android, it's a Windows product. This means that it is somewhat less compatible with my smartphone and that I cannot download videos/music off of YouTube Red to play off-line. On Android, you can save for up to 30 days and play everything without data or wi-fi. This feature has been a lifesaver for me because if I don't have something to listen to while fast walking, then I can make excuses for not exercising at all. Not so anymore. I walk longer when I listen to all the conspiracy theories on YouTube. They get my adrenalin pumping."}

I was going to get out of the tub and dry off when i slipped on the floor, my legs kicked the computer right into the water. I immediately pulled it out and discovered it wasn't working.(duh?) I dried it out, kept it on it's side and let it sit for a week. I just plugged it in today and it STILL works! I will admit that the screen is all wonky now but I am super impressed with the machine.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "I've had various Apple Macbooks for the past 10+ years and I'm currently a 1st year grad student. The majority of my work has been internet based for at least the past 3 years, so I decided why not do some research and see if I can get by using something other than a Macbook and save myself $600+. I've had this guy for 2 weeks and here are the pros and cons I've come across so far:\n\nPROS:\n-light, portable, SUPER easy to use, SIMPLICITY IS KEY...just log in to your google account and you're ready to go\n-if you have your life through google apps (photos, drive, gmail, play[music]), you are good to go on any computer and will basically never have to worry about backing up your life (as long as you have internet...but I mean realistically, who doesn't have internet these days?...)\n-I haven't tried dropping it or pouring water on it yet (don't plan to test out that feature), but the overall security of that protection is peace of mind\n-turns on and off super QUICK and when you open the laptop, you're connected to WiFi before you can even check if you're connected\n-screen brightness exceeded my expectations, the matte screen might give a little glare from a window or something but it's not nearly as bad as Macbook's glass screens\n-larger (and blue!) text on the keyboard is a nice touch\n-battery life is pretty good...I mean if you're opening up tabs upon tabs surfing the web, anything is going to die quick, but this little guy fully charges up FAST you'll never skip a beat\n-side speakers are nice and i think they're pretty loud for the size of this guy\n-a normal HDMI outlet is GENIUS...now I don't hafta worry about having an adapter from my Macbook to an HDMI---also connecting to a TV is seamless and the picture quality is nice\n-netflix and hulu are great and doesn't completely drain my battery after a couple shows like it did on my Macbook\n\nCONS:\n-smaller overall keyboard size takes some getting used to\n-trackpad also took some getting used to...I kept finding my fingers didn't smoothly slide over it like it does on Macbooks and it's smaller than I'm used to\n-overall less keys on the keyboard so some of your normal functions won't work, or you'll need to google certain shortcuts, but I still like the simplicity\n-keyboard is NOT backlit\n-loading multiple tabs is slow...not dreadfully slow, but it definitely lags, and if you do open up multiple tabs, go get a drink or a snack because it takes a hot second for everything to be fully loaded\n-typing is louder than on Apple devices\n-if you need something offline, you better make sure it's set to work in offline mode or else you're SOL\n-not really iPhone compatible...it'll charge it, but it constantly asks me to allow the Chromebook to access my phone...idk how many times I can click Allow for it to stop asking me\n-no iTunes...that's what google Play is for...I'm still working on what I plan to do with this issue but for me, iTunes is not life\n-I haven't tried it out yet, but I've read you can't use an external optical drive to watch movies or burn disks...it just doesn't do that...and TBH, if you needed to burn a CD or something, a Chromebook shouldn't be your first option\n-Google Docs, Drive, Cal, Play all take some getting used to, but once you're set up, you're good\n-little storage...but your stuff is saved to your Drive. if you did wants more internal storage, you can always get an SD card or external HD\n\nOverall, I really do like this little guy and can't believe how freaking budget friendly it is! And the best part is, if I ever need a new one, I can just go get one, log into google, and it's like I never left. No stress and completely worth your $200. If you're on the fence about it, my only suggestion is to make sure you're completely ready to make the switch to ALL google (photos and music were my main concerns) and you'll be fine. Go for it!! :)"}

The SSD is small but sufficient for the OS, crouton and addons ( of the 16 GB, nearly 4 is ChromeOS and stuff, after crouton I have about 3 GB free ). This is sufficient when you consider most of the work will be stored in the cloud, or, when working offline, on a USB stick.\nThe keyboard is quite good - amazingly so for such a small device.\nSpeed-wise: it's sufficient for browing the web ( how many videos can you watch at once ? ) , editing text & spreadsheets, etc. I would not edit any film with it - probably more internal storage and a faster CPU would be a necessity.\nAndroid apps can be made to run on it, but a touchscreen would greatly enhance that experience.\nSo it's not 5 stars because that would mean perfection - difficult for such an inexpensive device that serves it's purpose astonishingly well."}

The strong grip feel and light weight makes it easy for me to carry. I need all the extra protection this laptop offers since I'm such a klutz. The screen is a bit small and typing is just a tinyyyyyyy bit harder then on a big laptop but smaller was what I was going for. It's perfect so far (: and love that it came with a screen wipe and cable tie!"}

This model has a spill-proof keyboard which is what sold me.  My last Chromebook died over a spilled drink.  This is a very practical model to go along with the very practical Chromebook concept."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "Great general use (web, steaming video, basic documents, etc.) chromebook with excellent battery life, even on wifi. This model sacrifices \"thin\" and some weight for durability. The rubber bumpers should help protect from moderate impacts, though I fear the screen hinge may be a potential issue with extended use. While nothing has broken, I notice the lid does not open smoothly and can cause twisting if you open from one corner. I do not foresee kids being \"careful\" in how they open the screen.\n\nMy main complaints are:\n\n1) Keyboard labels (minor issue): While the keyboard is mechanically sound and responsive, the key labels are printed in medium blue ink which make them very difficult to read in low light. Why Google did not use a lighter keyboard paint is beyond me. I think this was a design > function issue. One could argue that \"kids\" shouldn't be working on their chromebooks in low light (ie. at night), but I frequently had to tilt the screen nearly closed as a light source to find certain keys.\n\n2) Video: For the price, I suppose you cannot expect full 1080 video, and 720 is fine if not a little blurry, especially when connected via HDMI to a TV. However, the color is somewhat washed out and the viewing angle is fairly narrow. You may find yourself adjusting the screen frequently if you change positions while using this chromebook.\n\n3) Audio: Again, for the price, you cannot expect high fidelity surround sound, but I did notice that during streaming tests, the source audio was degraded further than when the same video stream was played on a standard laptop. This was particularly noticeable when connected via HDMI to a TV set. Considering I have heard decent sound out of dirt-cheap mp3 players, I was annoyed by this\n\nSo, excellent little chromebook for general needs, but do not expect the Audio and Video to be very good for this price point. I am very pleased with the concept of user-replacable parts in this model. I am sure the idea was for this to be in use by younger students and perhaps the IT support for a school district could buy parts as needed or combine the parts from 2 broken chromebooks to make one working one as time goes on."}

I was tired of being a watch dog over letting our kids use expensive MacBooks. I debated on breaking down and getting a PC laptop and I just couldn't bite the bullet. We gave up Windows and PC years and years ago. After doing some homework, I found Chromebook. I am a little lost when trying to figure out how to download apps, but my son love this thing.

As a college student, carrying around a huge, heavy, and bulky laptop to and from class everyday was not very practical (especially when I had to make sure I always had the charger on me given the horrible battery life on such a big laptop), so impulsively, I bought this in hopes that I could relieve some of my troubles, and be more efficient in and out of class. Don't get me wrong, my Dell was great, but once I got my hands on this chromebook, my life has totally changed, and for the better. It's lightweight, fits in even the smallest of bookbags, and the battery life is phenomenal. Highly recommended for college as it is great for taking notes in class, doing work at any place and time, lunchroom, library, dorm, and especially for when you are in the hallway trying to complete an assignment right before class!"}

After a few months, my son dropped it, it broke, so I bought a second one on Dec 2, 2016.  That one didn't work out of the box either.  It is now Jan 23, 2016.  I have returned this one three times, and am still waiting for a replacement.  Needless to say I am definitely not impressed with the Repair Center (misnamed) and equally unimpressed with the Customer Service Center ( also misnamed).  I would never have bought the second one except that my son's school requires them.  Update:  finally received a working replacement Jan 28.  The replacement, however, was not a new, never-used unit, like the one I sent them, but a dirty, worn \"reconditioned\" one.  Talked to 3 people at Asus.  They all seem unconcerned and unashamed about this \"bait and switch\" or about their poor service.  So, to summarize, I bought a brand new notebook, waited two months before I got one that works, and it is a used one with dirty fingerprints on it!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "Well, I suppose I'm not super computer savvy but I spend a lot of time on computers and I know what I like. My wife and I own a Dell desk top computer which we share between the two of us. I'll be going back to school in the spring and we thought it might be nice to have an extra computer around the house so we could both work on projects, or watch videos, or whatever at the same time. Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of money to spend so I really did my research before purchasing.\n\nI spent less than $200 for this little Chromebook and I think I really got my money's worth. With the exception of the storage capacity (which can be easily upgraded with an SD Card), it seems to be on a par with MacBook Air but for less than a third the cost. It's fast, easy to use, light weight, and durable. The last two qualities are especially important to me because I'm a cyclist and a strap hanger. If you travel primarily by automobile, you can't fully grok how important it is for someone who travels primarily by bicycle and/or bus to pack light and have durable, water resistant gear. It isn't mentioned in the product description, but I was pleasantly surprised that this Chromebook came with a 12 month accident protection warranty. To me that says a lot about Asus' confidence in the durability of their product.\n\nAdmittedly, I am a big time Google user. I've had a gmail account for years and I use all the wonderful products - Drive (docs, sheets, slides, and drawings), Voice (both phone and sms), Hangouts, Keep, Calendar, etc - that google has. If you're like me in this you'll be very happy to see that this Chromebook is a natural extension of your blissful Google experience.\n\nOne thing I would strongly recommend to anyone who decides to purchase this product is that you explore the help (?) section soon after you start it up for the first time. This is a Chrome OS so its slightly different than a Mac or Windows OS and will take a little getting used to. It's very intuitive and user friendly but you'll save yourself a lot of frustration if you take an hour to learn how to use it.\n\nAll in all, I think this is an extraordinary product and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive, very portable computer for school or work. In fact, we liked it so much, we bought a second one for my wife. :-)"}

It's very light and easily fits in my day pack unlike my 14\" laptop that was too big and uncomfortable to carry in it. Thus far, I haven't purchased an actual case for this Chromebook since it is more rugged. It has held up very well to being carried around in my backpack for a whole day as well as running to catch the subway.\nDespite the smaller screen, I find it very easy to use and see. Otherwise, Chrome's zoom feature is easy enough to use. This handles watching videos and TV shows much better than I expected (I have the 4GB version). So far, I've opened 16 tabs and that slowed down loading the new tabs, but I didn't have any major problems. The keys are a little click-y and plastic-y, but the track pad works very well. I can't say I have any major complaints about this Chromebook.\nOne negative is that even with access to Google Play, Skype isn't optimized for Chromebooks and can't be downloaded to the device. I use Google Hangouts video call which isn't Skype, but it is better than the web version of Skype.\nOverall, I definitely recommend this convenient little laptop."}

This means that any contact, no matter how casual, with a second hand, thumb, finger, will cause your screen to scroll either up and down or left to right, or right to left.

In fact it has disabled all the previous cures and workarounds for this problem.

There is, but unlike my Windows machines, the chromebook wants a two finger tap on the track pad for \"right click\" functions -- totally necessary for spell check.

Other chromebooks might have faster processing speeds, but for things like facebook and google docs, this thing rocks.  SSD is the way to go.

For browsing the web and video streaming, thus Chromebook does its job well.\n\nThe keyboard provides a good typing experience with a full sized and well spaced keys. Key travel seems pretty similar to most laptops now - pretty short, but still enjoyable. It is missing a Cap Lock button, but I don't forsee that being a problem.\n\nThis is definitely a Chromebook I would recommend. It does exactly what it needs to do, given the price."}

The waterproof keyboard is also a nice feature, considering accidents are prone to happen. The stand on the bottom is helpful to make the computer level and holds in place very well. The software is ok, but I have had a few problems with it, like random crashing when I open the lid from sleep, and it just locking up for no literal reason.

You don't really need a cover for it and it will recover from small spills on the keyboard. (Check out Amazon's description in full.)  For $199 I got most of what I wanted. I wish the screen was IPS but for this price point I was able to get 4 GB vs 2 which my advisor said would improve the performance. Overall this is a pretty nice device for anyone that sets up quickly right out of the box. There is lots of online help for those that need it.  It comes with free 100GB of Google Drive storage for two years and 90 days of unlimited music on Google Play. The Google Play offer ends1/31/2017.

My wife and I both own high end 17\" AMD Windows 10 64 bit laptops with 16 gigs of RAM which perform very well but when we take vacations they are just too big to take along sometimes. While I prefer a Window OS and AMD systems and would rather have a Chromebook with an AMD system versus Intel, they do use much more resources then the Chrome OS and a Chromebook is just fine for our use on trips. Even though 4 gigs of RAM seems small, it is plenty when running the Chrome OS. The Intel Celeron is also a lower end CPU but it works very well in this. We like this so much that we ordered a second one so that we don't need to share. This is a bit heavy for its size but that is because of its sturdy drop resistant design. Love the keyboard and love that it is water resistant. This thing just feels well made and works like it is well designed. I could not have made this better myself. It does come with a 16 gig eMMC which is a bit slower then a SSD, it also works very fast. Another great thing is that ASUS made this so that parts are easy to replace even though I fix laptops so that doesn't matter as much to me. While the display is not true HD, it is hard to tell with an 11 inch screen."}

Yes, it doesn't have the brilliant picture of some other Chromebooks out there, but it is very sturdy, easy to handle and pass around because of the rubber  bumpers, and it gets better wifi reception than any of the iphones or android phones in the house.  .I'm very happy with this Chromebook."}

The battery is amazing as well, it tells you not only a percentage of what is left, but an actual time that is left. If you are looking for a simple on the go notebook, this is the perfect one."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "Easily my favorite laptop. Within the liimits of ChromeOS (if you don't know, read about it), and for Google-guy me, those aren't significant limits at all), this is very, very nice. Light, long battery life, ruggedized, boot in seconds. About the only thing I'd \"fix\" would be to add a back-lit keyboard, and for touch-typing it's not that important.\n\nAbsolutely, I would buy this again. Except that for this quality, I don't expect I'll ever need to. By the time it \"wears out\", the technology will have moved on. And ASUS has become my go-to brand for computers, the standard by which all others are judged."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "I needed a netbook that I could take out onto the farm and not worry about exposing to the elements (i.e. moisture in the air, drizzle conditions) or overthink in where placing device  - because I'm going to set up on whatever surface is convenient. So far so good. The only drawback is how the screen is lit, (you have to adjust at just the right angle to see a clear image of entire screen). I liked the fact I was able to plug in the power cable and use pretty much out of the box!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "C202S is my first chromebook and it is great and affordable. ASUS seemed to execute very well on this one as it is almost all 5 stars among existing reviews by 2016 August. Let me elaborate what I like about this chromebook and probably among other chromebooks (common advantages):\n\n- USD$229 is on the low range of prices\n- Keyboard feels good with excellent stroke depth and the keys do not cramp up\n- It has sturdy and strong build\n- 4GB of RAM is good for a lot of apps/tabs opened\n- Screen size is right for portability and readability\n- It starts real quick (common)\n- It comes with 2 years 100GB Google drive that is nice\n- It has a slightly faster CPU than the N2840\n\nWhat I think it can be better if\n\n- It has 32GB storage instead of 16GB storage. This does not seem to be an issue as SD card slot can be used to expand the storage.\n- It has IPS screen though this screen is reasonably good\n- It comes with backlight keyboard.\n- It has touch screen. I did think about the Flip but looks like this one has less complaints than Flip so I pick this.\n\nThe bottom line is that it is a productive tool which is worth its value."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "I had an ASUS Chromebook for two years prior to this purchase, and it was worth every dollar. As a college student in a nursing program, 90% of my time studying and in class is spent typing notes or reading electronic textbooks. This Chromebook is excellent for my educational needs and beyond. The battery power lasts as expected and, just as my previous Chromebook, the charging time is incredibly quick to reach full battery. The Chromebook really feels heavy-duty, while looking stylish. I have already received numerous compliments on the appearance of my device. It is a perfect size, fitting into bags without any issues, and is not too heavy to carry around. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on, and the screen is just fine for the price. The other features, such as the spill-proof keys, add to the appeal of the product. Additionally, each Chromebook purchase I've made has included 100 GB of Google Drive storage for two years. Overall, I really couldn't be happier. As long as Chromebooks exist and continue to be designed so well, I will be a loyal Chromebook customer. I can't imagine putting my money toward anything else.\n\nUpdate: I bought this Chromebook in June of 2016. It is now February of 2018, and the love has not faded. My Chromebook is still in top shape! Excellent battery life, quick to reach full-charge, durable, small to transport but comfortable to look at/type on, and it looks nice. Highly recommend!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "I have been using this for a week. I love it. It has a very rugged feel. The battery life is excellent.\n\nAs a bonus, my wife also loves it. She found it very intuitive compared to Windows 10 and picked it up quickly. I will likely be ordering another one for her! :)\n\nI do agree that the color choice for the keys is poor. A plain white would have been better. My USB mouse was recognized immediately although a Bluetooth mouse would be better.\n\nAs a nice plus, it also connected right away to my Chromecast on the TV."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01DBGVB7K", "review": "So far it's meeting my expectations. I wish I had done more research before purchasing a braswell machine! If you want a custom OS, buyer beware, your options are limited and the hardware is more about battery life than performance. Crouton works with xenial with no trouble, so that's a plus. There is room between the screen and case for things to fall inside though...\n\nMinor negatives aside, it's serving its purpose very well. 4/5 for a general purpose linux machine. 4.5/5 if you plan on using it in docked mode (screen closed = weird screen build issue not a problem)."}

Fortunately, I was still able to return it to seller."}
