{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I rarely if ever write reviews on Amazon but I received this Chromebook on Monday, May 2nd, 2016 and was just simply blown away by this product.  For $299 this is hands down the best Chromebook money can buy.  You can finally say goodbye to the Toshiba Chromebook 2.  The funny part is the day before I received this my girlfriend just got a brand new Macbook Air which I played with all day.  With the lid open on this Chromebook it literally appears to be a Macbook Air save for the backlit keyboard.  I mean no one really cares to pretend that their $299 machine is a Macbook Air but I think they did a pretty good job on the design.  The screen is sharp and the feel of the Chromebook is about as premium as I have seen in a sub $500 Chromebook.\n\nIf you are in the market for a Chromebook or any laptop where your basic use case is web browsing, email and video consumption then take a look at Chromebooks and more specifically this exact product.  Acer has got a hit on their hands.  Acer never really hit it big in Windows laptops but they continue to be one of only two brands putting out quality Chromebooks the other being Toshiba.  But then again the champ is dead now.  Long live the Acer Chromebook 14."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I never write reviews, but I just had to with this Chromebook.  I am blown away by the build quality at this price point.  It was up and running in minutes.  I am so so glad I picked this as my first foray into the Chromebook world.  I'm a teacher who uses Google Docs and Drive all the time, but I still love Microsoft Office products.  However, This purchase is the tipping point.\n\nThe screen is sharp, the keyboard is great...all of the stickers came right off and left no residue.  Now I've got a perfectly symmetrical, monochrome aluminum laptop.  Even the way the screen is mounted is pleasing and very minimal.  The only slight disappointment is the camera, but after toggling over back to it, it really isn't half bad!\n\nIf you are in the market for a Chromebook, this strongly merits your consideration.\n\nI suppose I should revisit this in a few days, but early impression is through the roof!\n\nEdit:  After a few days, I'm even happier with this machine.  I think the keyboard and screen are fantastic.  I read a very informed sounding review that spoke again and again about how this laptop isn't as powerful as other Chromebooks, and not as premium feeling as a Macbook.  As to the performance claims... this machine loads web pages faster than my core I-5 laptop, and due to it's low power, I used it for four days before I had to plug it in! I guess you could get a better screen or a smaller bezel, but I have to adamantly declare that I love this laptop.  Power is irrelevant if low power performs this well."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "For Chromebook fans, one persistent nagging issue has been the generally under-powered hardware for users who really push their machines - once you have a dozen or so tabs open with a half dozen extensions, many Chromebooks can start to slow down noticeably. Until now, the only option available has been the $1000 Pixel which is a beautiful PC but way beyond the budget for this kind of device.\n\nAcer has identified the Chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin, metal, almost Mac-like build, armed with 4GB of RAM, a full 14\" HD display and a Quad-core CPU. Even the touchpad and keyboard perform as well as the very best Chromebooks currently available (which, until now, I would have said were built by Dell and Samsung). The performance never lags, it meets the 10-12 hour battery life promise in my usage tests, and it's quickly become my go-to computer for both home and work.\n\nIf you're new to Chromebooks, here's what to expect from this Acer machine and the O.S. generally - these are genuinely 'instant-on' machines, highly secure and tightly integrated into Google's suite of apps and tools. Anything that runs in a Chrome browser on a desktop or laptop will run on a Chromebook, and there are novel app-like extensions for almost anything else (calculator apps, command lines, etc.) For an office, you can give everyone a Chromebook and their environment becomes available on login and disappears when they sign-out, and the machines can also be remotely managed if you're a Google Apps customer.\n\nFor home users, these cheap machines fit many use cases from casual browsing and two-screening, to watching videos and calling family. They're ideal for elderly parents and in-laws who might other spam their own machines with malware since Chromebooks are much harder to break than a Windows 7/8/10 PC. For students and road warriors, the extended battery life and automatic cloud integration makes sync-ing a breeze, especially if you hotspot from your phone. And as with many other Chromebooks, this Acer also comes with some additional freebies such as 100GB of Drive space, Google Music and a dozen in-air Gogo passes (worth over $100 alone).\n\nAs a 5-year Chromebook veteran, I've been waiting for this machine. It takes the basic premise of the simplicity and security of the Chrome O.S and matches it with high quality hardware at a value price. From the camera and audio quality through to the build styling, every aspect of this PC has been meticulously considered and it represents the best Chromebook that has been delivered to date"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "Docking and undocking my work PC is a PITA, it never recovers correctly so I often have to reboot, and it's a little bulky.  I was going to go with a iPad or similar to have portablility back for meetings and such but didn't want to drop the cash and also wanted something with more of a keyboard.  After looking around I decided I wanted to try a chromebook with 4Gb/32Gb combo for $200 or less.  I couldn't find that anywhere and most models were 768 resolution,I was about to give up on chromebooks.  Then this guy showed up with ram and storage I was looking for, 1080 screen and aluminum slim chassis was a huge plus in my opinion which convinced me to bump my budget $50.  I was looking at Dells offerings and they were thick plastic, to get what I wanted kept pushing me to $300+ plus range, and had trouble finding a screen better than 768.  The Acer was a no brainer for me.  When I unboxed it, I noticed it had more bulk than I was expecting, nothing terrible, weight seems to be toward the hinge, must be where the battery is located.  The aluminum is cold to the skin at first touch, but much better conductor for cooling I would imagine than plastic.  I am a guy with no patience for slow PCs so I was leary about what I was getting myself into with a chrome book.  It is surprisingly quick to boot and sleep/awaken, something Windows still struggles with.  Google play store has all the apps I use in Windows and I have only had for a few days so I am still honeymooning with it but so far I like it a lot.  I spent quite some time streaming Youtube with its first full charge and I had at least a full 8 hours out of it, I would suspect if I was just browsing and didn't have the display cranked I could have gotten more.  I was also impressed with the sound quality that it had while watching videos.  I have a strange new obsession watching train crossings live on youtube lately and the trains look clear and the horns sounded authentic, I had to turn it down so I didn't anger the wife watching TV.  The display is crisp and has a wide viewing angle, it doesn't have that funky LCD color fade if the screen is tilted the wrong direction slightly and is somewhat matte to reduce glare.  The keyboard has shallow keys that take a little getting used to and the mouse pad takes a little more pressure than I think it should need to click so sometimes I need to take an extra half second to realize I need to push harder.  I have converted to tapping the pad instead of clicking because it easier, right clicking is accomplished with using a two finger tap.  Only thing I really wish it had was illuminated keyboard, but that can be remedied with a USB light for $10 which will likely affect battery life, it's kind of cheesy solution but for the price point I think I am asking a lot.  I have recommended this to people I know and I would also to you, I don't think you will find anything better than this for the price today.  Just remember it is a Chromebook and not a full PC it has some limitations but I have been impressed with its performance.  I loaded Hearthstone just to see how it would run, it had long load times but once I was into the game the motion was fluid, the audio clear and I began to forget I was on a chromebook.  I have an Alienware 15r2 at home, comparing the two I was impressed that the chromebook was able to keep up.  Certainly it had lower frame rates, less visual effects and much longer load times, but the game was still good looking, smooth and playable.  I wouldn't run anything crazy on this but for what it is I was impressed.  If you are on the fence, give a shot, I think you'll like it.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "Our first experience with Acer (but not our first Chromebooks), and so far, it's a good one.\n\nFit and finish\n\nThe aluminum case feels quite a bit sturdier and more rigid than our previous Chromebooks having molded plastic cases. There is a slight wire-edge along one side of the lower case of one of the two units we ordered, thankfully not sharp enough to cause cuts, but slightly annoying in normal use.  Beyond that, however, the case is nicely constructed. The hinge appears to be nearly full-length design, a plus over the small hinges used on some laptops.\n\nThe display is sharp and bright, colors appear reasonably accurate. Native resolution appears to be 1536 x 864.\n\nKeyboard is your standard \"chiclet\" type.\n\nFeatures\n\nThere are two USB3 ports and an HDMI port on the left side. Power and charging LEDs, headphone jack, and charging connection are on the right side. Speakers are downward firing, which means the sound performance is highly influenced by the surface on which the machine is used. The touch-pad is quite large and adequately responsive. There's also a camera and mic located in the top screen bezel.\n\nI'd have preferred three USB ports being available, as that would allow for an external wired keyboard and mouse while still leaving a port free for things like a USB-to-Ethernet adapter and/or a USB stick. This is an especially notable lack, when one also notices that there is no SD card slot, thus making the machine's larger 32GB SSD that much more important.\n\nThe charging connector and charger I found disappointing. The charging connector is tiny and might therefore be quite fragile for such a constantly used item. Coupled (often literally) with that is a large, clunky, right-angle molded connector, separated by only about an inch and a half from a molded-in ferrite choke. In actual use, this means the the charging cord is awkward. Setting the Chromebook down to charge results in the cord's choke often ending up under the machine. The short section of cord from connection to choke often ends up being bent at quite an acute angle, which I suspect may cause premature failure of the cord. The charger has a separate AC cord, which, depending on one's preferences, might be either a pro or a con. I have noticed that the charger gets quite hot under initial charging when the battery is quite low.\n\nPerformance\n\nMost of the items I have noted above are really quite minor, and many are highly dependent on one's use case or preference. The Chromebook performs just fine, start up is typically fast, and I noticed no significant slow-downs when having a fair number of tabs open. This Chromebook supports Android applications, so the range of available Apps is broad. I had occasion to test out my USB-connected Wacom tablet with Adobe's Photoshop Sketch Android app and found it to work very well. The Acer detected and activated the tablet without any input from me required.\n\nOverall, I recommend this Chromebook. It's reasonably priced, and pleasant to use. For most people, it should be a more-than-adequate choice."}

My Macbook finally bit the dust, so I was in the market for something more affordable now that I'm not in college anymore.. so I purchased this, for 1/6 the price what I paid on my souped up Macbook. The keyboard/trackpad took NO adjustment, because they're every bit as smooth and easy to use as the Macbook. The set-up was as easy as turning it on, entering my google ID, and DONE. The interface is clean and crisp, display is gorgeous, and I have ZERO complaints with how quickly I got everything up and running. The lack of hard-drive space is jarring, but the Google Drive storage is more than enough for me. I feel GREAT now that I'm free from the nightmare of iTunes. I regret nothing about this $225 purchase. This has EVERYTHING that the average non-gamer adult needs."}

I spend a good deal of time muttering under my breath because the cursor jumps all over the place and I accidentally close programs with an errant pinky. I still had some of those kinds of mishaps with the Chromebook -- but not nearly as many.\n\nMy place of work uses Google for everything, so not having MSWord wasn't such a big deal. Plus, Google Docs has a way of saving things so that they're compatible with MSWord. The machine is great for streaming videos -- my wife and I use it regularly to watch things on Amazon Prime -- and the battery last quite a while.\n\nThe usual caveats apply: You need to have a Google account to set-up the Chromebook and you must have Internet access to use it."}

Otherwise you'll find out it is a pain the backside to do much of anything other then surfing the web and even then the browser isn't as good as one would expect from a internet search company either. Just buy a Windows based system, there are comparably priced machines, because eventually you'll wish you did, or at least I do almost every time I use this laptop."}

When comparing it to my $2,400 macbook pro 15\", it's hard to justify that the macbook is even worth it.  Then again, I do video editing/music recording which macbook is superior in.\n\nIf you're looking for a machine to be productive and browser/read/study, this is it.  One of the best laptops I've ever owned.\nThings I like:\n-Keyboard is better than my macbook.  The keys are easy to press, have just the right amount of travel and are quiet.  The macbook is the opposite of this so anytime I'll be typing (like for this review), my go to is this Acer machine.\n-Screen quality is amazing.  With 1080p IPS display, it looks great.\n-Battery life, I've never run low, even after a full day of use.  I get over 10 hours of use out of this easy.\n-Construction is good and it feels like and is a quality machine.\n-Touchpad, it's decent.  Much better than any other windows machines I've bought, but not up to par with macbooks magic trackpads (Which the new trackpad is $170) so almost the price of this computer for an external trackpad....\n\nI think from here on out I'm going to save this computer so I can rebuy it if mine ever breaks.  And this computer has given me a little more trust in Acer which I was never planning on buying."}

The speakers are on the bottom of the computer, which is kind of awkward, but they get pretty loud. It comes with a long charge chord, and I haven't had any mechanical problems so far.

As soon as you have a local LAN at home or a NAS for storing data, the Chromebook performs poorly.  Accessing a local share on a NAS is unreliable and causes unstable peformance and lock ups.  Seems to be meant for Internet use.  We still use it and deal with the workarounds by usng another laptop with windows os as it has no problem with network shares, etc.  Had high hopes, maybe pass it along to our kids..."}

Instructions sent to me to recover and reinstall the OS have failed due to some hardware failure.  I don't know what happened, but six weeks of this garbage is enough.\n\nAs a power user who is familiar with Mac, Windows and Linux, the Chrome OS is incredibly frustrating.  I have more control over my android phone than I do with this laptop.  My laptop worked a total of 6 days before I ran into a huge problem with the login credentials.  The OS comes with google's app suite such as Play, Books, Music, etc.  For some reason, those apps on day 6 decided to shut me out.  I can't get into any of my data without logging into the web app.  The reason for the poor rating, is there's nearly NO tech support.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "First off the chromebook itself is excellent, one of the few budget models with 1080P and a long battery life. It arrived in \"as new\" condition despite being a refurbished (likely a return). It is a steal at $179 and worth a 5 star rating for the previous reasons.\n\nHowever, if you are someone who is very particular or sensitive to (minor) bait & switch internet sales tactics you should be aware of a possible issue when buying a refurbished model. There are two iterations of this chromebook the C5EX and the C5FM. The advertised model is the C5FM. You may, as I did, recieve the C5EX instead with a newly printed label slapped over the older C5EX label on the box (chromebook itself retains proper C5EX badging).\n\nThis may sour some buyer's experience; however, there is only one functional difference between the two models. C5FM (the advertised model has an SSD) and the C5EX (model I recieved has eMMC). Yes, SSDs do have faster read/write times, as well as, better and upgradeable firmeare than eMMC - so there IS a difference between the two models. But, honesty, for the intended use case of a budget chromebook (youtube, bill paying, amazon prime watching machine) this difference is negligible. If you plan to use this as a portable productivity device... perhaps look elsewhere."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I have had owned this Chromebook for more than 1 year and 7 months...or 590 days to be exact.\n\nI'm a heavy, heavy user - starting each morning when I first wake up and on and off throughout the day and then at night before I go to bed.  Every day!  I get about 6 hours battery life every time - but I keep the screen brightness turned all the way up.  I recharge the unit almost ever afternoon.  The few times I've lowered the brightness when curious about battery life, I've measured over 8 hours duration.\n\nThis Chromebook goes almost everywhere with me.  Work, trips, vacations, overseas, etc.  It is truly a workhorse - and has been rock-solid reliable.  I think this is my fourth Chromebook - others have been from HP and Asus.  This Acer is by far the best of the Chromebooks I've experienced.\n\nSo considering 590 days of ownership and usage - and considering that I charge it twice most days, I would estimate that it has been charged 1000 times.  I find it remarkable that the batteries have lasted through so many cycles.  I know the batteries have a finite life and number of cycles - and I would have thought I would have reached that point already considering my heavy usage.\n\nMy only complaint - if I could dig one up - would be that the charging jack is a little loose.  Not that it causes a problem, but I would prefer a more reassuring connection.\n\nSo all things considered, if this Chromebook were to break in half tomorrow, I'd still feel like I received a tremendous value.  And I'd order a replacement as quickly as possible - and that would be the exact same model."}

Heavy use (games etc) I get around 6. Has all the features you expect from a Chromebook (super fast boot, great battery life, lightweight, etc), and has a solid feel to it.\n\nThe screen is great, but keep in mind many streaming video services do not support the Chrome OS, so they won't take advantage of the screen.

Second issue - the headphone jack doesn't work properly, because this is a low quality product with a hardware defect.

The performance is reasonably quick for most things, and it plays videos, YouTube and Netflix without problem.  The speakers are also quite good.  The build quality, while generally good, does in my case have one minor flaw.  The metal bezel around the monitor keeps lifting up.  I have already returned my machine once to have this repaired, and now within a week of its return, the bezel is again lifting up in a corner.  I don't know if others are having this issue, and while it does not effect the functionality of the device, its is very annoying.  The one thing that definitely makes this an outstanding machine is that it has Chrome OS on it, and not that god awful Windows 10.  This means its stable, reliable, and not affected by the multitude of Windows problems, including all the update failures and screw ups Win 10 is now so famous for.

I hover over an item to click and it clicks something else (literally) 2 inches away from my click target. I expect a lot more from Google. On the other hand I am not surprised in some ways being that I have had a horrible experience with ACER machines in the past 10 years. I figured that once they teamed up with Google that the research and due-dillgence had been done to provide a good quality product and to stand by it. This this is useless now and I will stop at nothing to get my money back. DO NOT BUY this product!!!!!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I've owned this chromebook for 1.5 years. As other reviewers have pointed out, the powercord doesn't stay in the decide due to the way the interface is made. So if you have it on any unsteady surface (like a bed) it may stop charging with a little movement. It is also very heavy due to the metal casing. Overall, I was fairly satisfied with this device until it fell off my bed (about 2 feet) on to the carpet. Due to poor powercord interface, it bent accepting part of the power supply (the part inside) and now can no longer be charged. I contacted Acer to schedule a repair of the power inlet. They said their minimum charge is $150. At that price, no reason to repair it. I have an Asus that lasted a little over 6 years, was lighter, and had a much better powercord interace. I won't be buying another Acer, mainly due to the excessive repair fee."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "For a long distance trip I decided to buy a small computer since I wanted to be able to do some web browsing, use Skype, and transfer video files from my camcorder to a travel drive. I was originally looking at getting a PC stick or mini-PC, but ultimately chose this Chromebook since it has a screen, webcam, and keyboard, and is powerful enough to play 4K video files cleanly without stuttering (though de-rezzed to 1080). There are a number of things to like and some things to quibble about.\n\nPROS\n====\nLightning fast start up and shut down\nDecent powerful CPU\nExcellent battery life; quick recharge\nRuns android apps\nLight weight\nGood picture\nThin profile\nEasy to adjust brightness\n\nCONS\n====\nNo SD card slot*\nNo Ethernet port*\nLimited functionality\nVery limited storage\nNo disc writing capability\nHeavily dependent on net connectivity\n\nFirst the good - for basic general usage this Chromebook more than satisfies. It turns on ready almost like a light switch and while my actual battery usage was closer to 8-10 hours than 12, it still is mighty impressive and great for a long haul flight. It's also quite light and extremely thin - much better than any Windows laptop I've worked with over 20 years. I picked this model because it is sufficiently powerful - yes, everything is doomed to becoming a dinosaur over time, but I didn't want it to be next year with this thing, and it runs pretty swiftly for what it can do. It's also very easy to adjust the brightness - just push a button on the keyboard - good luck trying that easily on some Windows laptop.\n\nNow the not so good - and some of this is just Chrome in general while others are specific to this model. First, I wish to God it had an SD card slot like a tablet. It would make it so much better in so many ways, and not need to make it really more expensive. Its 32 GB of memory after the OS and everything is just over 20 GB to store things on. And yes, you can use an SD card reader on one of the USB ports (at least they're USB 3), but you only have 2 ports on the device. Next, there is no Ethernet port. And again, you can get a USB to Ethernet port adapter rather cheaply, but as above, you are using up one of the USB ports. Which comes to the next point - the ports are too close together. If you use a card reader, it's unlikely you can put anything into the other USB port because it's obstructed. Finally after looking around, I found a card reader with a cord that lets me use both ports again, but I didn't need all this frustration. And you can try to use a port hub, as long as you don't run into any device conflicts. Overall it would have been nicer to have one port on each side, and actually, 3 ports total, not 2.\nThen there's the fact that you can't burn a DVD or Blu-Ray with this. I would prefer to back up my data this way instead of risk losing it on a card or drive.\nFinally though for me there is the issue that Chromebooks are heavily dependent on a good net connection - yet even then, for large files it can be cumbersome or inadequate. Trying to upload large video files to your cloud storage is simply impossible unless you have a killer connection...and still could take hours and hours. It does run Android apps and some of them are pretty nice. But it still doesn't come close to all the windows programs there are, so it is quite limiting. For some programs, there are substitutes, but for others you are up the creek. It isn't meant to be a full blown laptop though and for its price it does a pretty nice job in spite of some limitations."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "Worked fine for a few months, then this morning it wouldn't charge and it showed a battery with exclamation mark. Called Acer after kicking around for online solutions. Their hard reset advice didn't work. By using Ctrl D, I found the OS was damaged. Acer wants me to Fedex across the country to Texas at my cost to repair this piece of junk. They will not provide packaging but reserve the right to deny repair costs due to shipping damage. I'll never buy Acer again. I will price the cost to ship Fedex, but I don't want to throw good money after bad. Save yourself the hassle and buy with a company that stands behind its product."}

She keeps it chair-side in the living room and prefers it to her desktop computer because it's much faster - nearly instant on. Works well with wireless mouse; WiFi is fast. Solid state components make it fast. Chromebooks make things easier in many ways because of the integrated approach of Google - her email is available on her Chromebook as well as an Android phone. Downsides: won't work with our USB-connected printer - wireless printer required. No \"delete\" key so one is required to do a non-intuitive backspace to dump a selection to the trash."}

I realized I needed to update the Chromebook and so I went into system setttings and searched for the last eat update. It found it, downloaded it and installed it. Then it just rebooted without prompt. It did not come back up and the screen has been flashing with the system light flickering as well.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "Updated 3/24/2018 (four months later):\nGreat laptop despite many product and service limitations of Google itself. I am currently chatting with an Acer rep for a warranty repair, as I have had issues with a flickering or outright black screen. This is 99% my fault, as I played hour-long meditation videos non-stop a LOT. I will update this review again with info on how my experience with Acer customer service was. Be sure to get another outside warranty just to be on the safe side.\n\nFIRST REVIEW:\nFirst day, first two/three hours with product:\nThe hardware is very sleek and elegant for the price! The all-metal build feels sturdy, isn't prone to fingerprints (as far as I can tell. I watched one of my fingerprints actually disappear on the body before my eyes.), the keys have nice travel, the screen is great, and I can find no defects yet! I bought mine brand new so I would hope nothing is wrong with the hardware (or software)! Since it's metal, it's prone to grow very cold if you leave it be in a cold house/during the winter time. But it's metal, so it's to be expected and it's a lot better alternative to an overheating device! There's no fan so you won't have to worry about that anyway.\n\nAs for Chrome OS, I had a Chromebook once before (from another manufacturer whose name also starts with an 'A') sometime in 2016 and the experience was less than pleasant, mostly due to the hardware rather than Chrome OS. But actually NOW I have noticed some things in the OS I don't like compared to the 2016 version I'd had! After an update or two your Acer CB14 WILL update to allow the Android-based apps Google Play Store to be installed on it....But it's faulty and has a long way to go before even the stock Google apps are optimized for Chromebooks! The Play Store app itself has more than a few design and functionality flaws that make it difficult for any consumers who is familiar with the Android Store to ignore or get used to. It's hard for me to explain and I do not want to make along first review, but they are there and hopefully will be updated in future update packs. I recently spoke with an online buddy who has the Acer CB15 who also noticed the lack of optimization Chrome OS's Play Store has...\n\nA lot of the stock shortcuts (for Chrome [Browser], GMail, Docs, YouTube, etc.) are still just hyperlink shortcuts (they take you to a website instead of opening an app) rather than the actual apps, and this is really disappointing, but once you update your CB you can just install the Android app versions, \"unpin\" the stock hyperlink shortcuts and go from there.\n\nI'll try to be a bit more lenient with this device in my future updates, because access to the Play Store on Chrome OS is still very new, but believe me when I say I am grateful I'm not one of the people shelling out over $300 (and up to about $1700) for a Chromebook because it is truly not worth it. They have a ways to go before those price tags are warranted in any way."}

I still have some basic questions on Docs, but that is on me -- I need to do some research.\n\nScreen quality and size are excellent.  Fantastic deal for this price.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I decided to jump on the chromebook bandwagon since so many people were raving about it. I will say that if you're used to having a Windows laptop and expect this to feel the same, you will be very disappointed. Sure you can check your email, browse the web or watch YouTube, but that's as far as it goes. It's capabilities won't really go past that. I wanted to Skype, and I could... If I went to their site each time and used their web extention. No option to download the app to make Skype just one click away. The same happened when I wanted to get a torrent downloader. None work with chromebook, and extentions that might have were a hassle to figure out. I didn't have a fresh goat or virgin to sacrifice on hand to make this task seamless. Not being able to download popular apps for all of my favorite things was the ultimate deal breaker for me. Some people will say you can do anything on a chromebook you can do on a windows or Mac laptop, but who wants to spend their day finding loop holes in a new system. I want simple with an easy user interface.\n\nThe good side; if you don't want all the fancy bells and whistles and just feel like browsing the web and checking your email, this will be perfect for you. If you have a Gmail account, you'll love it even more with the way it integrates your account with everything made by Google. Just don't try to watch a dvd or listen to a CD since thus has no disk drive. But hey, the battery does last an awful long time."}

This machine is very good for what it does, the price and spec ratio is perfect for light development using crouton (xfce linux).  In the ChromeOS I was able to quickly and easily swap the ctrl/alt keys since I find the Mac keyboard layout is far superior (use your thumb and c/v for copy/paste).\n\nThe only thing I've noticed (besides all the annoying details of a linux box) is the upper half of the bottom shell isn't completely flush on the edges.  It makes for a scratchy edge as the top overlaps the bottom.  I'm tempted to take a file to it.\n\nThe machine is generally snappy and works well.  No fan does worry me a bit figuring that some websites (google hangouts) turn my Macbook into a hot toaster.  I'll see how that turns out soon enough."}

It's bright and resolution is not grainy like other 14 inch chromebooks at this price point. It gets good battery life. It's lightweight and has a nice aluminum quality construction. Some of the standard windows keys are missing off the keyboard like page down/up, home/end, del and caps lock but you are going to find that on every chromebook out there. You have to learn some new keyboard shortcuts as they are unique to chrome and are different from mac or windows. It's completely silent (no fan noise). I have mostly apple products but I bought this chromebook because it feels like a macbook air at 1/5 of the price. The only draw back is you might find some web based chrome apps are lacking in the full functionality compared to the standard mac or windows version. I really think this is where the future of computing is anyway, so might as well get used to it."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I was pretty excited about Chromebooks. They're like a little-known gem, practically unknown in my area, where Macs still rule. I borrowed a Chromebook before, and I was impressed with its speed and simplicity.\n\nI have mixed feelings about this Acer Chromebook. Like the other one I borrowed, this one feels streamlined and easy to use. It seems more intuitive than Macs or Windows. I like how it's so simple, without so much clutter and complexity. It's easy find and delete pics and files you've downloaded. Things don't get lost as easily, and you don't have to dig around for stuff as much as on a Mac or Windows computer.\n\nThe keyboard and touchpad are awful on this Chromebook. Like other budget laptops, the keys feel cheap and uncomfortable. They have a low-quality, hard plastic feel and a weird textured grain to them. I wouldn't want to do any extensive typing on it. The touchpad is hard and clunky. Even using it a bit makes my hands/wrist uncomfortable. This would be best used with a mouse.\n\nDoing general internet surfing is a breeze on this laptop. Overall, it works well and is easy to use. If you're mainly on YouTube or reading stuff online, this Chromebook functions well for that purpose.\n\nI still haven't figured out Google Cloud Print. I've Googled, but still haven't found an easy way to print. I've learned that most external devices, like printers and cameras, work best with Windows computers. With Macs and Chromebooks, you might run into a lot of problems and bugs.\n\nIt's all integrated with your Google account, but I'd prefer to not have that. I suppose you can sign in without using your Google account, but I haven't tried that yet.\n\nBelieve it or not, the webcam on this laptop DOES NOT have a video function! You can only take still pics with it. You can't Skype, video chat, or record video on this. Acer really tried to cut corners to keep this a budget laptop, and surprisingly, they decided to not have a video function on the webcam. This seems like almost a deal breaker for me, but I'm keeping this as a backup or additional laptop. There are extensions that have video, but I haven't found one yet that works well and can function as a typical laptop webcam. The video extensions tend to be productivity apps that you integrate with work-related stuff, with the video as one of the many functions on it.\n\nThere's no easy and obvious way to use different browsers on this. There are extensions for IE and Safari, but then, they've failed to download on this Chromebook. I think they're blocking you from using other browsers. The extension industry seems to be very limited and subpar for Chromebooks. They are still a pretty small percentage of the computer market, so developers aren't spending the time or expense to develop good, usable Chromebook extensions for obvious things.\n\nI'm still keeping this as a backup or additional laptop because of its cheap price. It's still good for basic internet usage.\n\nPROS: Streamlined and simple; easy to use overall; easy to find/delete pics & files; good price; looks nice from the outside, with the lid down; good 14\" screen size that's surprisingly hard to find\n\nCONS: Webcam doesn't have video - only takes pics; awful, uncomfortable keyboard & trackpad; Chromebook extensions are lacking and don't address/make up for the limitations of this Chromebook; a bit heavy and clunky; hard to figure out Google Cloud print"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I've been using this constantly since I bought it, it is so much better than the inexpensive one I had first. It is serving me well in every way, but I don't have any technical knowledge, so I can't \"speak that language\". All I can say is that I was surprised at how heavy it seemed after using my old (smaller by at least 1\") Samsung. Also there is a little 'rim' on the bottom edge created by the top of the keyboard fitting into the bottom of the case. It is uncomfortable when I use the chromebook on my lap, in bed, which I do rather frequently as I am often bed-bound by necessity. It is just an annoyance, not really a problem. And I assume the heavier weight is due to :)  (Much more powerful hardware in there?) or a sturdier case and of course that extra inch of screen size. I am loving this machine.. Oh, and the HD screen? It's a pleasure watching streaming video.\nBig gripe about Chromebook OS.... it is not pairing with my bluetooth speaker made by \"iHome\". I read on the net that this is a fault in OS software for chromebook, though I haven't explored other options with tech support. Good luck to any other buyer with this issue. The speaker in the machine is typical of laptop speakers, in other words, sucks. Thus the missing star in my review. I can use my iHome speaker hardwired with the Chromebook so that is an option. Good Luck"}

If you buy an Acer product, turn it on and run into a problem, Acer will require a Credit Card number to charge, just to talk to you.

From my Toshiba chrome book I looked up and called the support phone number, \"Acer help site | (866) 695-2237\".  After navigating through their IVR menus I made it to a customer service rep.  Before he would even talk to me, he told me that Acer requires a credit card number to charge for the help.

I'm using it for college, and using it to stream from my desktop PC when more horsepower is needed. The display and construction are better than expected for this price point, and the keyboard is satisfying to type on. The space bar however, does not always actuate if hit on the far right, but using your left hand to actuate it fixes the issue, or hitting it with sufficient force with your right thumb. It's enough for medium productivity work, with 802.11ac wifi, so is able to do medium browsing (the Celeron n3160 can't support much more than 10 tabs). The tracpad is passable, and my only complaint with it is the lack of pinch-to-scroll, which is a limitation of chromeOS rather than the device. I also wish that the AC adapter was a bit thicker and robust, as it is fairly thin and looks flimsy. Finally, an addition of an SD reader would make this device much more versatile- 32GB of flash memory is not much to work with between music, pictures, and other documents."}

But it's not all aluminum. The keyboard surface is plastic and made to look like aluminum. By contrast, another Chromebook I have (the ASUS Chromebook Flip 10.1-Inch Convertible) is truly all aluminium. Also, the Acer 14's metal chassis comes with a cost: Weight. This slim laptop still weighs 2.6 lbs. That's in the territory of a more versatile Windows 10 laptop that can also run Chrome. For testing comparison, I compared the Acer 14 also with an Asus C202SA-YS02 11.6\" rugged and water-resistant Chromebook. It was 2.6 lbs. The Asus Flip 10.1\" was only 2lbs. Now, you're getting more screen with the Acer 14 and I realize that, but the screen isn't that great.\n\nThe Acer 14's screen is matte (something I like) and it's full 1080 HD (something I also like), but it's a bit dim. The screen on the Asus Flip is much brighter (although it's as glossy as a mirror, and that's very annoying). To my eyes, the Acer 14 screen is a mixed bag. Yes, it's on the larger side from Chromebooks. But it's a bit dim and that's really a disappointment.\n\nAs for processor performance, the Acer 14 didn't score as well on the Octane 2.0 online benchmark test as I expected. It beat the Asus Flip, and the Asus C202SA-YS02 11.6\" but not by much. Obviously most Chromebook users aren't looking for power, but I like to be able to stream music and videos while working on Google Docs, and apparently the Dell 13 (a Chromebook I did not have for comparison testing purposes) scored much better than the Acer 14.\n\nKeyboards are subjective and everyone has different preferences. I like quiet, low-profile keyboards myself. The Acer 14 keyboard has nice chicklet keys, but they feel a little too spaced out, if that makes sense. It's a subtle feeling, but it just feels like the keys are a little far apart.\n\nThe sound on the Acer 14 is excellent. I don't know what kind of speakers they put in or how, but the sound is really great. Of the three Chromebooks I tested, it had hands-down the best sound.\n\nOverall, I think the Acer 14 is a Chromebook trying to look like a Mac Book Pro, and I resent that marketing ploy. As a professional who prefers metal-cased laptops, I would still rather have a Chromebook made of polymer with a super-bright and clear screen and fast processor than to have a heavy Chromebook that's made of of a mixture of aluminum and plastic, with a mediocre processor and screen. The Acer 14 is a case of fashion over function and, for me, it's a no-go. I'll be returning it, and sticking with my Asus Flip 10.1 for now. If anyone has a recommendation for a Chromebook with a larger screen, please let me know if the comments section. Cheers."}

The aluminum frame has proved to be exceptionally rugged, the screen hinges feel brand new, and the keyboard and trackpad are still operating at peak. This Chromebook has been used heavily, stuffed in backpacks, carried around the home and campus, and still looks and works like new.]\n\nBeautiful laptop. I've been using Chromebooks for years as my primary systems. This Acer Chromebook 14 is noticeably higher quality than most Chromebooks, with a beautiful aluminum shell, a great screen, and a nice integrated trackpad. It has a much classier feel than most Chromebooks, and the price is a relatively small premium over its all-plastic brethren. The shaping/sculpting of the chassis is very Mac-like; it looks good and slips easily into a backpack. I've been using this system for about a month, and it's a joy to use.\n\nMy other current favorite Chromebook is also an Acer, the Acer 15.6\" HD model. The extra inch and a half of screen is really nice, but it's also quite a bit bulkier and heavier, so it's best as a computer that lives on a desk most of the time.\n\nBoth of my HP 14 Chromebooks died in just over a year (just after the warranties expired). One one the fan is shot; on the other (which is fanless), the keyboard died. I'm fed up with the poor build quality of HP Chromebooks and have been much happier with the quality of the Acer models."}

However, be prepared to restart your computer every couple of days to reset it because some function has randomly stopped working. So far, the PDF viewer and the internal file app are the two that give me the most trouble. The latter is awful because when this freezes, not only does it prevent you from viewing all of your files directly, but you also cannot upload it as an attachment or to share on any site. Sometimes, when you leave your browser open, you will find that all of your tabs have crashed and need to be reloaded.

By far the best OS I've ever run....well I've never owned a Apple so can't compare to them...\n\nI bought this to replace a Asus 13.3 which was my first Chromebook....had it for a couple years, never slowed down like Windows, but something went wrong with the screen....Tried replacing the screen, but something in it wasn't right, like a loose wire or something...So I gave up on fixing it and ordered this Acer...\n\nI've seen some reviewers not liking the keyboard, but I really like it!! The battery is awesome! Only thing was this don't have a SD slot...but I had a card reader that plugs into the USB port....uploaded some pictures to Google Photo's and noticed that by using the card reader in the USB port the pictures upload much faster....so it turned out for the best!!\n\nOnly time will tell how well this laptop will hold up!

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "As other reviews have mentioned - its a bit heavier than expected for such a slim frame. That being said - this is VERY slim! Love that part while still having a good number of ports. Specially having HDMI to be able to connect audio/visual on the go for presentations (or movies!) is great! The chrome finish has a sleek and high quality feel to it which is nice. Seemless integration with my google apps & easy to download any other extensions/apps needed for quick access. If you're anywhere near comfortable with Google apps/products then transitioning to a chromebook should be very easy.\n\nMy only wish is that it were a little more quick/less laggy given it is a chromebook - but for the price point its a great buy. Thinking of possibly googling how to make a chromebook faster is a bit of a disappointment considering I didn't get a full computer to avoid those types of hassles.\n\nOverall, I'm definitely satisfied, I bought it wanting a well built laptop on the larger end (which is why I ultimately went with the 14 inch) with a solid material/frame."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "This chromebook is everything I hoped it would be, and I like it well, but it's got one major problem.\n\nThe good part: Since I almost everything I do is online, a chromebook works well for me. I already had a smaller, cheaper one that was okay, but limited by the small screen size. This model is big enough to use for working on graphic design and watching reasonable-sized videos. Everything about it is easy to use and learn. In fact, if you're used to using Google products, there's practically nothing to learn at all.\n\nThat major problem: This machine has an incredible sensitive touchpad, which makes it easy to click on something you didn't mean to click on. So far all that's happened with this is that I've been taken to some ads I had no interested in, but I have to be really careful. Otherwise I could be trying to scroll down a page and have it accidentally click on an unintended \"buy\" button or an \"add as friend\" button."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "First off I am typing this review on my Acer Chromebook 14 laptop. I have had this laptop for 3 days and so far I love it. It is exactly what I wanted for the price. I already used google for docs, and drive, so I thought a Chromebook would be a good cheap portable substitute to a real full laptop computer. I was not disappointed. It does everything I expected of it. It can handle multiple browser windows at once without slowing down. It boots up almost instantaneously, and it was very easy and quick to set up. Probably took 20 minutes to link all my online accounts to this computer and personalize it.  The operating system design is very simple and reminds me of a simplified version of linux or apple ios. I like how easy it is to link to your google accounts. If you don't mind google being all up in your business this is the os  for you. I mean it is incredibly convenient and very light and portable on the physical side. Plus I just love the light and airy aesthetic of most chromebooks. The 1080p screen of this model is nice, not perfect but great for a light general use laptop. I wouldn't watch high def big picture movies on it, but that is what chromecast is for. However it is great for youtube and short tv shows or videos on tumblr, facebook or twitter/vine or whatever. It's speakers are a little lacking but acceptable. Works perfectly well with my steel series wireless headset I use for gaming on my pc and ps4. The battery life is great. I test ran it dry and lasted for as long as it says.\n\nI'd say this chromebook is perfect for college use considering the access to docs and sheets. Plus it is cheap, only around $280, and does pretty much everything you would need for a undergraduate college experience unless you are in programming or animation. For the price I absolutely love it. very much worth the 280 I spent on it. Should get me through my masters degree program just fine.\n\nPros: easy to set up, long battery life, light, sleek aluminum casing, enough processing power for multitasking\nCons: Shallow Keyboard (consider a wireless one for long typing), The screen is a little lackluster for real immersive HD, no SD card reader, which isn't that bad unless you frequently use a digital camera. (And even then they have adapters)\n\nMiddle ground: speakers are okay not great, camera is good for skype and video chat but not great for photography. ]\n\nOverall if you are on a budget and need a good sturdy computer to get by I would get this one. For the price this thing is great. I am very happy with my purchase."}

First off, the keys are remarkably shallow, and take a good deal of pressure to initiate. What's infuriating though, is I've had this laptop for for just under three months, and half the keys now stick. If I hit the \"n\" key, and don't absolutely slam my finger down, it's 50/50 as to whether or not my keystroke will be input.

Fast, easy to use, relatively inexpensive (especially compared to traditional laptops), and long battery life. I would give 5 stars...\nIt is now less than 7 months later and both stopped working properly. On one, the left side of the keyboard works intermittently and one vertical column of keys not at all, the other machine will not turn on. The screen stays black. Yes it's fully charged, and we checked the contrast. No noise, no screen, no nothing. This happened within 2-3 weeks of each other, I am mailing these back this week for repair (they're still under warranty) and we will see what is done. I will update this review after seeing how it is handled.\nUPDATE: Shipping was free for both, but I had to pay @$20 for the boxing/packing at UPS. Received both machines back w/in 2 weeks. 1 needed a new motherboard, the other they replaced the whole upper half of the case. Both are working great again. These are excellent machines for the price. Will keep the rating at 3 stars due to both having a problem in such a short time period from purchase."}

I'm a Mac user, so I was a bit hesitant not knowing a lot about this brand of computers.  After about a month, the screen started shorting out and just continued to get worse to the point where the screen wouldn't stay on for more then a second at a time.  I called Acer's customer support, and of course spoke with an off-shore representative.  There was definitely a language barrier, he put the problem description in as system won't boot.  The system was on and working if you could actually see the screen.  I just received the computer back from repairs and it worked for about 2 days and the same problem started happening again.  I once again called customer service and they said that the LCD was replaced.  Clearly it's not the LCD and some sort of short in the wiring between the screen and computer.  I was unable to be transferred to an on-shore representative, so hopefully this time the repair will work."}

I liked the idea of a chromebook - no Windows, no Microsoft Office - just a simple, streamlined device that I would mostly use to surf the net, post on Facebook, and watch the occasional video. Unfortunately this chromebook is very sluggish. Many videos won't play at all, and others are constantly \"buffering\" so that it gets frustrating and I quit watching. We don't have the greatest wifi connection, which doesn't help, but my partner's inexpensive old laptop works a lot better than my new chromebook. I've tried a couple of \"fixes\" but nothing has really helped.

It was a great choice so far..no heavy operating system in your way starting up and shutting down which I love. I'm so sick of updates with Windows! I had tried windows 10 on another machine that my mom owns and just thought that operating system is so redundant and layered IMHO. This is simple and gets the job done for me! The 14\" screen is the perfect size and Google docs - sheets - spreads work perfect. People have commented about the screen quality and key board but for me.... and given the PRICE POINT..it can't be beat IMHO.

Ignore anything you hear or read anywhere about all Chromebooks being able to run Android apps.

Not even if you switch to the developer channel. Not even if you run all the various workarounds that are supposed to provide this or other Chromebooks with access. Nope. This is an enormous disadvantage, now that many other existing Chromebooks are getting that support, and with all new Chromebooks getting that support. That renders this machine inferior to competitors in a big way. Yes, it's perfectly fine as a Chrome-only laptop. But even if you think that's all you want, why would you give away the opportunity to run Android apps when you could get a decent Chromebook for roughly the same price that also gives you access to the world of Android apps?\nUPDATE: A few days after receiving this machine, I discovered the microphone doesn't work. Checked and rechecked all settings and permissions, researched all fixes, tested multiple ways, powerwashed (which means reset all software to as new)--no question, it's just a hardware problem.

There are a few kinks in the operating system that need to be ironed out but I only have one REAL complaint - connecting the printer is a pain and it keeps disconnecting from printer! This is a known issue with chromebooks and I do not understand why it hasn't been resolved yet. I did not understand this when I purchased this chromebook for myself. YOU MUST HAVE ANOTHER COMPUTER TO CONNECT TO PRINTER, and if I had another Mac or Windows computer, why would I have purchased this?? But it isn't like you just use your old junky burnt out computer to connect you to your printer and you are good to go... no... because if you don't use it constantly, your printer will \"go offline\" even though it isn't actually offline and it will fail to print. Ive seen it happen in as little as 3 hours. I run a business from my home and I have to keep using my husbands macbook to get back on chrome and connect my account to the printer so I can print something, which is very inconvenient since he travels a lot and if my printer goes offline while hes gone, Im screwed! I have read the work-arounds online and I have tried them all and its useless and very frustrating. So NOW I MUST go purchase a cloud-ready printer so I do not keep running into this issue. Way to go Google... you win. (But Acer, your laptop is very nice.)"}

While the form factor and feel is similar, this is _not_ a substitute for an Air, no matter what the other reviewers say. This is a ChromeBook with all of the benefits and hindrances they bring (I'm pretty set in the Google ecosystem so it works for me). One problem with this model is as of this date you can't use Google Play applications, so you're limited to Chrome extensions. There are plenty of good ones that solve a lot of use cases but in order to get most of the functionality I need I'm using 26 different extensions. An update is expected sometime this year that will provide Play store functionality, but until then keep in mind the limitation. It does make a difference."}

The battery light was flashing amber and nothing we did made a difference.  Some online research and we came up with the EC (?) reset; reset + power buttons.  This did the trick.  Tonight, with a full battery charge, it just switched off whilst being used.  The blue \"activity\" light is off and no amount of resetting will get it on again.  It's showing that it's fully charged, but simply won't switch on, no matter what.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I've been using this Chromebook for about half a year now, and I can say with absolute certainty that it's one of the best, if not the best, Chromebook in the market today. Even after this many months, the Acer Chromebook 14 (CB3-431) is still holding its ground against the newer devices. This is, in fact, due, in my opinion, to the following PROs:\n\n- Neat aluminum fan-less design that is simple and classy (partly because it's inspired by that of the Macbook Air)\n- Amazing battery life that will easily get you through a day's worth of work with no need to recharge (which is a major advantage of Chromebooks in general)\n- Very bright and very sharp 1080p display with a hinge that goes all the way down (not that you're going to use that for anything, but it's a safety measure)\n- Enough ports to get you up and running with most accessories you might want to use with it (2 USB 3.0 and a Full-sized HDMI)\n- Great keyboard with a chiclet layout and sufficient key travel\n- Large trackpad that supports multi-finger gestures and does not pick up oil or dust\n- Small sized portable charge in case you need it\n- Great webcam with a relatively wide angle\n\nHowever, like any computer product, the Acer Chromebook 14 has few CONs where it might fall short of the expectations of the consumer:\n\n- No SD Card slot (which also means no expansion of the 32 GB storage)\n- CPU not as fast as benchmarked, in certain occasions, it can show so lag or the entire OS might crash (it also has to do with RAM and ChromeOS itself)\n- Battery life will not remain in the advertised 13h range. After a couple of months, it's decreased significantly to below 8 hours.\n\nObviously, there are the few inherent disadvantages that come with ChromeOS as compared to its rivals. But, if you are a student, like myself, or simply looking to browse the web without the need for any specific software, this platform, and specifically this laptop is for you. Even if you need the occasional photo-tuning software of else, these days everything can be done online through a web app or simply a website. Most importantly, with the upcoming release of Android apps compatibility with ChromeOS (and this Chromebook is on the list), I doubt anyone would not find that compelling.\n\nThe reason why I am writing this exhaustive review is because I waited quite some time to get my hands on the perfect Chromebook. I believe Acer got closer to that standard with their Chromebook 14 (CB3-431) than any other manufacturer."}

Sliver thin and sturdy.  Nicely designed. Seems to hold a charge forever. Boots up so fast that you basically open the case and it's on.  We have tablets, smart phones, a new tower running Windows 10 and an old laptop running windows Vista.  For our world, the Google/Chrome universe is simpler to work in.  We never use Microsoft Office.  Google Docs and Sheets is sufficient.  May not be the case for everyone.\n\nOne design suggestion would be to move the headphone jack from the right side of the case to the left.  Most headphones have the cord coming off the left side of the headphones and most people are right handed.  The jack would be better located on the left side to keep the wire out of the way. Small concern in an overall outstanding design.\n\nWe purchased on Amazon Prime.  Showed up in two days.  Amazing service."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "Update 1/7/2017: I found and solved the problem. It was not a clear cut problem, but the unit now works, and except for the dimmer than expected screen, it works fine, so now 4 stars.\n\nThe fix: After power washing the unit several times and setting it up again, to no avail, I finally was led by some web postings to the idea that some browser add-ons and extensions might be causing it to crash on the new computer, but not on my older chromebook. I finally logged on to my browser on another chromebook and disabled/cleared the extensions using the sequence: Settings->advanced settings->reset settings. Then, after a power wash on this unit, and setting it up again, it started working properly.\n\nIts nice to have a larger screen. I'll comment later on the unit after some experience.\n\nI am still a little worried about the comments here on failues.\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nIf the unit was not defective I'd probably give this 4 stars, not 5, subtracting one for the dim screen.\n\nPrefacing my review I'd like to say I love chromebooks in general, and have an Acer 11 inch I bought 2 years ago and have used continually, even do stuff inside a chroot Ubuntu environment. It has never given me a minutes trouble and I have really loved the chromebook experience, and no longer even use WIndows unless forced to.\n\nWanting a little bigger/better screen, I bought this from another vendor, Best Buy through a Uchoose VIsa card awards program. It seemed not to power up normally, but after plugging in the charger it came up, with 90% charge. That was the first clue something was amiss.\n\nWhen it came up I logged in to my google account to get it synced, and after that the browser kept rebooting: shutting down, then coming back. I never got any further with it and am trying to return it.\n\nI think the form factor for a 14\" chromebook is fine, a little heavier and larger then the 11\", but I expected that. But, the screen was much dimmer than I expected, and makes me rethink larger, low cost chromebooks. I will look at more in stores before I buy another."}

After a couple of days it would act funny sometimes, I may have had to restart it after freezing like once or twice, but I just thought it was a fluke and I still really enjoyed it. After a month I opened it one day and the screen went white with the error \"chromeOS is missing or damaged\". I followed all of the directions and did everything to try to recover it but when I tried for recovery mode it just said \"unexpected error has occurred\" or something like that. It bricked on me.\n\nOk, I got a bad one, that's alright, it happens, I love my other samsung chromebook that I've had for a few years so I'll try this again. Got a replacement shipped and sent the broken one back.\n\nThe replacement comes in a box that's all messed up, like maybe it had been thrown around. I open it and the new replacement chromebook doesn't work fresh out of the box, but it didn't look visibly damaged.\n\nAfter having received two brand new acer chromebooks that were broken, I decided I don't have time to mess around with this so I'll be buying a different brand. Maybe the first one was just a defect and the second one really was damaged because of something outside of acer's control, but I'll never know and I can't be without a laptop long enough to order a third and find out."}

I knew I was not getting a traditional PC to install applications on. But was anticipating being able to install from the Play Store once the OS was updated to 55. OS updated but still not able to access the Play Store apps. Basically this is a tablet with a keyboard.\n\nI learned a lot though about Cloud computing and using the Google Drive and Apps. I was skeptical about it in regards to usability but found it was OK.\n\nWhat I like:\nQuick startup - open the lid and the screen is on and off you go to do what you can.\nAdequate screen.\nIt \"feels\" solid.\n\nDisappointments:\nKeyboard:\nKeys are a bit thin and have an odd feel to them. Takes a bit of getting used to before you can type quickly.\nNo \"delete\" or \"home, end\" buttons.\n\nChrome OS/Chrome browser:\nCannot access Google Earth web access even though it's a Google product.\nCannot stream from DirecTV Now even though Chrome is a supported browser - but not on Chrome OS.\n\nIf I knew what I know now I would not have purchased a Chromebook. I would go with a cheap Windows 10 laptop.\n\n***Update April 1, 2017***\nStill no access to Play Store apps.

The track pad is spacious, allowing freedom of movement. The keyboard isn't my favorite; not backlit and not as tactile and clicky as I would like it. It's quiet, muted, and doesn't have a lot of travel. It's ideal for those who prefer a low profile laptop without the added noise. The screen is full 1080 HD, very clear, and can get very bright, or extremely dim. The stated battery life is 12 hours, but after charging it up to 100%, it said there was roughly 10 hours left. If on the lowest brightness levels, you could probably push 12-13 hours no problem.\n\nINTERIOR: Although the stated processing speed is around a modest 1.6 Ghz, topping off at 2.24 Ghz, it manages to deliver a slick and speedy experience.

My original is about 4 years old and I have had no problems. The new 14 inch, which I promise, I got for my husband, has a very clear picture and much better sound. These Chromebooks are great for everything we do on a computer. Take it out of the box and plug it in. No software or virus protection to buy. The sound is very good, it's fast even with multiple tabs open, and the price is great. Many of our friends have laptops and tablets that cost 5 x what this cost and use their expensive toys the very same way we use our Chromebooks-paying bills, social media, email, shopping, surfing the net."}

It performs really well and I use it for just about everything. It occasionally forgets to start upon opening - something that my old one did as well. And it flickers every once in a while, but I've read that is a problem with the OS and I'm not motivated to take the steps to change it. I'm very happy with the Chromebook OS - I get the Google Office and Google Drive cloud storage. It takes a little while to get used to something that's not Windows but I'm really happy I did!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I gave this computer a five-star rating because I thought it deserved 4.5 or better and it was only at 4.2. This rating is in no way, touchy, feely but derived from my estimate of the value of the system. The computer is a solid and attractive package and if 'only average' as another reviewer has claimed average is very good for a computer that cost me $229. at Amazon on Black Friday. It deserves a 5-star rating when measured against other systems in its price range.\n  This is my first Chromebook and I want to begin with my impressions of the Chromebook experience. It streams Netflix with no problem. I can write on Google docs offline, which is very nice when covering long meetings. I have experienced problems changing the default brightness and font size but that doesn't mean that it can't be done. Google voice is lovely and helpful and addicting. I hope they expand the use of it soon.\n  The computer has one major flaw which is endemic in current laptop design. The large touchpad is just an accident waiting to happen when you are typing. The screen is brilliant and very sharp. Sound is adequate. I had a set of small inexpensive external speakers and added them for a great improvement in the movie experience. This computer is vastly better than what has been available to people who have to seek out value in their purchases. I can fully understand why they want to compare it with laptops costing $1,000 more. It has a truly long lasting battery and you will never have to pay to update an operating system. Whats not to love for anyone who is seeking serious value rather the subtle hint of citrius in the prolonged finish."}

Stating that, because Chrome OS/Browser incompatibilities, issues, etc are common enough during standard use that you'll need at least a spare PC laying around to compensate for them.  Don't think so?  How about, I can't login to my bank's website because the Chrome Browser throws (simplified) a security error.  Yea...kind of important.\n\nSecond, the build quality isn't great.  It's built with nice materials.  But there's varying production/processing defects (as witnessed in other reviews).  One day in, the frame (bottom) started to bend/peel away from the bottom of the screen.  And the brushed aluminium chassis is wavy in a couple places.\n\nGot mine 5 months ago from Best Buy.

Plug the HDMI into your TV and you have a giant screen.  I never even have to touch the chromebook or open the lid.  I keep the charger plugged in and on a timer to give it a 30 minute charge once a day.  It stays inside a wooden trunk 24/7 and the wireless keyboard and mouse easily connect quickly.  It's an excellent set up for helping kids with schooling and any other types of learning while the whole family can see it all together on a jumbo screen.  You can pass the keyboard and mouse around the room to anybody while never having to touch the laptop or worry about dropping it, spilling anything on it, or tripping on cords.  It also connects to your phone so you can text through your TV, just download Mighty Text on your phone and chromebook.  It's pretty cool.  It doesn't have a CD drive, but if you need one then just get a laptop and use the same configuration.  Acer seems to make great products.  It is very thin and light weight as well.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "So I wanted a new laptop to replace my 11-year-old laptop that is so outdated it can't even load modern websites, and since I pretty much only use(d) my laptop for the web, I figured a Chromebook would be ideal.  It would also save me several hundred dollars relative to a Windows machine or Macbook.\n\nI was unsure whether I wanted this Chromebook or the 15\" model with upward-facing speakers, and ended up going with this one largely for aesthetic reasons: the aluminum case is not only lightweight and fanless, it also is attractive and could be confused for a Macbook.  The downward-facing speakers sound good, although as with all down-facing speakers how they sound depends what surface you put it on: on my kitchen counter, loud and clear; on my couch, still clear but much quieter.  This is mostly just fine.  The screen is bright and sharp, the keyboard has a comfortable feel to it, and although I have a wireless mouse, the multi-touch trackpad is effective enough that I don't need to use it.  I also get about 8-10 hours of battery life from my typical use of one tab of YouTube and a dozen tabs of social media, Wikipedia, and miscellaneous websites.\n\nThe only negative things I have to say: the processor is a bit slow under some loads (although I am willing to put up with this for not having a fan), the power plug feels somewhat loose and fragile, and Chrome apps tend to be somewhat underwhelming compared to their rich client counterparts.  Overall it was worth it for me. 8)\n\nUpdate: After a month, the touchpad has started working only intermittently.  Sometimes it works like normal, sometimes it requires a bigger imprint than the tip of my finger provides, sometimes it does nothing (although a physical press for a left button click always works).  It seems to get worse when it's cold.  Although I'm sure Amazon would make it right if I returned/replaced it, I'm lazier than that, and I'm mostly okay using a wireless mouse on my laptop.  Still, -1 star for build quality."}

The aluminum body is very stiff and premium, the keyboard and track-pad work perfectly. As long as you shut the computer down every time you are done using it (which is not a hassle given that it reboots in seconds) then the battery will last you about 3-4 of general use. I took mine on vacation and watched Netflix every night for about an hour only having to recharge once. The speed is great. As long as you are connected to good internet, then this thing is very speedy. Integration with google docs is amazing. My classmates are loosing 14 page papers due to Microsoft program issues and I never have to worry about that problem. Google office is the future of business. For the price, I am certain that there is no better laptop. Also, the screen folds completely flat which is a great feature for reading PDF books.

It has so far black screened on me one more time in another 4 hours of use. From my research it looks like the issue I experienced was a chrome 54 bug that only affects this model chromebook. Who's fault is that then? I updated to the beta channel to ensure I'm on 55 so hopefully it's smooth sailing from here.\n\nI purchased this chromebook as an upgrade over my old Acer c720. I went with Acer again because I had a really great experience with my old chromebook, that thing survived 2 years of heavy use and I never had an issue with it.\n\nI used the 14 for about a half hour when it arrived and then set it aside for a couple days. When I opened it up I entered my chrome password to sync my bookmarks the chromebook started crashing. It would load the browser, and couple extensions, and then black screen. Rinse and repeat.\n\nI went online and found out there's a utility that creates a recovery disk you can restore chromebooks from. So i tried it with an old external hard drive, and I got \"an unexpected error\". I tried it with a usb stick and got the same error. I've looked all over forums and have tried everything I can find and I'm finally tearing apart my house for an ancient usb 2.0 drive not made by sandisk because that's the last troubleshooting step I can find.

The aluminum case really is impressive and feels very nice compared to most plastic bodied laptops.\n\nThe problem is that I received a defective unit that will not charge and will not stay powered on when unplugged from the charging cable.  After a bit of research on Google (search \"Chromebook battery 1%\" - yikes!), it sounds like there may be a fix for this of getting into the guts of the Chromebook and unplugging the battery, booting up, and then turning everything off and reconnect the battery.  I am not going to attempt that with my brand new Chromebook, but I do find it troubling that so many others have had this problem.\n\nWith the Chromebook plugged it, everything seems to perform beautifully.  I am used to typing on a laptop that also has a number pad on the right hand side, so I find myself usually one letter off when trying to type.  I am sure it is just a muscle memory thing that I will adjust to, but it was something I found interesting when using this new Chromebook.\n\nThe 1080p screen is beautiful and HD video does look very nice.  I watched some football on the TimeWarner streaming site and it was clear and crisp and motion was generally very smooth.\n\nFrom the other reviews, it looks like Acer may have some quality control issues with this Chromebook with others also receiving their brand new laptops DOA or with other serious issues.\n\nI have replacement on the way from Amazon (thank you Amazon!) and will adjust my review accordingly when the new one arrives.  It may be a 5 star product if I had received a working unit, but I have a problem giving a product 5 stars when I have such a frustrating experience from the start.\n\nUPDATE 12/27/16\n\nI received the replacement from Amazon (thanks Amazon!) and have been using it for about 3 weeks now.  I am typing this update from my new Chromebook now.  Everything is now working properly and it is a nice little computer.\n\nI only have a few complaints.\n-The first is that the keyboard is not lighted, which would be a challenge to have in a laptop in this price range.\n-The second is that the space bar does not seem to be responsive unless you hit it directly in the center with your thumb.  I have found myself missing about half of my spaces when my thumb presses the space bar on the far right hand side.\n-Finally, the power button is placed just barely above the backspace key, so I have found myself accidentally pressing the power button when I get a little too aggressive with the backspace key.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with the computer for what it is.

However, having been out of school for several years now, the viability of purchasing a mac (particularly as they are increasing in price) no longer seems viable. With this in mind, I did extensive research to find this computer. I was hesitant at first because of the price, but I have to say that this is honestly an amazing machine. First of all, the battery life on it is insane. Twelve continuous hours with full use is unbeatable. Secondly, this is a really aesthetically pleasing machine. It is thin, lightweight, and very elegant looking. Third, I am really excited for the eventual android apps that will become available early 2017. There are, as with everything, several growth opportunities for this model. First, it is hard to run more than 10 tabs open at any given time. It just slows down the machine. Secondly, the trackpad feels a bit delicate. Having said this, there are very concrete steps you can take to counteract these issues. You can get a wireless mouse (Amazon Basics has one for $9 that is honestly unbelievable), and you can just limit the number of tabs you keep open.\n\nMake the purchase. Go for it.

I selected this device specifically because it has a 1920x1080 display, is a good size, has a decent amount of RAM and disk space, and has a quad-core x86_64 processor (I develop for x86 platforms, so ARM would have been cumbersome to work with). I'm using it as an in-house web server and an on-the-go development system, and after a bit of setup it's absolutely delightful! I wiped the factory OS and installed Arch Linux, but before doing so I played around with ChromeOS, and it felt responsive, well-polished, and very user-friendly.\n\nPros:\n-Great battery life!\n-Good display.\n-For a Chromebook, it has a pretty decent amount of RAM and disk space.\n-Quad-core processor\n-Uses x86_64 CPU architecture\n\nCons:\nMy complaints are either not unique to this specific device (ie, related to ChromeOS), or they're only issues because I'm using the device in a way it wasn't intended to be used. These complaints mostly only apply if you're intending to wipe the factory OS and install a different OS, so if you don't know what I'm talking about for any of these items, you're not going to have to worry about that item and can disregard it.\n\n1: The first time I started the device and logged into my google account it sat at a screen saying \"syncing your preferences\" for several hours. Ultimately I restarted, it informed me there was an error communicating to the server, and it logged me in in less than a second. This seems to be an OS issue, and nothing to do with this specific device.\n\n2: When enabling developer mode, the first time I rebooted in recovery mode I was greeted with a screen informing me that the operating system was corrupt and I needed to insert a restore drive to proceed. I reset the computer, tried again, and everything worked okay. Again--this seems like an OS issue and not really specific to this device.\n\n3: I couldn't locate any proper documentation on which of the two large silver screws on the motherboard is acting as the ROM write-protect jumper. In case the information is useful to anyone: the screw I removed before successfully flashing the ROM was the large silver screw on the motherboard which is closest to the center of the device (there are only two large silver screws on the motherboard and one is near the front of the device).\n\n4: I really can't pin this on this specific device because I'm doing something unsupported. After flashing the ROM with the latest from John Lewis's site, I was able to access SeaBIOS but while GRUB does load, the screen freezes as the display is trying to transition from the SeaBIOS display to the GRUB display resulting in not being able to see GRUB and GRUB only seems to want to load the first boot option available (after compiling a new kernel I couldn't boot into the new kernel until I made it the default option for GRUB). Again, I can't hold it against this device--just something to be aware of.\n\nObviously it's not going to push modern gaming graphics, but if you're looking for a portable word processing machine, a thin-client for remoting into a workstation, or a cheap system to use as a screw-around system or an in-house server, the Acer Chromebook 14 is brilliant!"}

I also have Linux and Windows workstations on my network and access them via SSH, VNC, and RDP.  I'm been quite pleased at how well the Chromebook has worked for all these tasks.  The free SSH client from the web store works to logon to my Linux machines and can even do public key authentication and port forwarding, enabling me to tunnel my VNC connections through SSH.  The Chrome RDP app also works well, connecting to my Windows machines with good performance, and I can access files on my NAS using Network File Shares  After using the Chromebook for the last couple of weeks, I'd confidently recommend one for everything but gaming and special purpose applications.\n\nThe quality of this unit exceeds my expectations, and if feels solidly built while still very thin and light.  The keyboard and track pad are both quite good, although I always use a real mouse.  Battery life is excellent, and I can get several days use before needing to plug in.  With a solid CPU and 4GB of memory I can run a dozen or more open tabs with good performance.  I'm not sure just how many things I need to open to notice performance degrade because I haven't hit that point.  Saving the best for last, the full HD screen is one of the  primary reasons I chose this Chromebook, and it is wonderful.  Scaling works nicely when needed using either Ctrl with mouse wheel to scale just the browser contents or using Ctrl, Shift, +/- to scale the resolution of the entire screen.  I've shopped around for Windows laptops with higher resolution screens and they are all well beyond this price point.  To me, this Chromebook is a great value."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "Great so far. Outstanding Black Friday price. I did have one issue when I first booted up that I wanted to describe in case others find similar situation.\n\nAfter the quick initial setup I log into my profile and the browser opens, and fails. The screen turns off and on repeatedly then eventually brings me back to the profile login screen.  At first I thought a faulty display, but then noticed that the screen only went black - turning off and on - when I had logged in and open a browser.  My hunch was that there was a chrome plugin I was using which had a compatibility problem with whatever version had come preinstalled. Most likely the plugin is the one I used to prevent chromebooks from turning the screen off after a period of time. I use the chromebook to display presentations and need it to be showing for hours at a time.\n\nSure enough when I tried 'guest' mode everything worked fine. From there I went into settings and opted to check for the latest version of ChromeOS.  That downloaded and then restarted. From then on everything has worked exactly as expected."}

It's got an exquisite all-metal body that makes it look like it's at the level of Macbooks and Pixels. Keyboard looks good and feels nice. Although on the track-pad side, it's not as smooth as the high-end laptops, but it's almost there. The 1080P screen rocks and has really nice, true colors, but it could be brighter. The speakers are also pretty decent. Battery life also lasts ~9 at normal usage. All in all, this laptop is so worth it!

Everything is amazing, love the look and everything about it until now. Today I got to my apartment and decided to see how the computer fares with multiple monitors. Plugged it in, and all I see is purple on the second screen. Tried to change to difference monitors and different HDMI cables... same problem. What this tells me is that the HDMI port on my chromebook is defective. Will be sending this back for a replacement.\n\nI read a lot about people getting DOA versions of this product from the reviews and thought I got a pretty good one until now. Manufactures need to quality check their products before sending them out. Having these issues is very frustrating.\n\nEdit: Added a picture for the purple screen. The issue is not constant, after restart the HDMI port would work properly for an hour or so before returning to this purple screen. Either way, for a new product, this is a defective part sold by the manufacture.\n\nEdit 2: Received my replacement two days ago and finally opened it today. DoA. After logging in to the replacement, the screen flashes black every fives seconds and restart the chrome browser. Very disappointed. Added the video to show the problem.  Will be sending it back in for another replacement. I am very tempted to get a full refund as this point but the tiny book is used so much for work right now."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "***UPDATE*** (with a second unit, the replacement)\nI really gave this Chromebook a chance only because it is really beautiful. And NO, it is not worth it. It crashes at least once every 2 days. Sometimes the flickering issues can be solved just by closing and opening the laptop, but sometimes it takes more than 5 minutes to work again. The mouse pad and the space key never worked the way they were supposed to, and writing on this chromebook (which was the whole purpose of buying it) was just a pain. I finally returned the item and wanted to try a third product for the last time. It had so many good reviews, that I thought that maybe was just bad luck. But then the seller decided that my only option was a refund, and refused my replacement order. Then Acer (the seller here) tried to charge me $59.00 for a Restocking Fee. Thankfully, the Amazon Customer representatives assisted me, and I got my full refund.\nIf you read carefully the reviews, even the ones with more than 3 stars complain about the same issues, mentioning the fact that they just got used to a chromebook that randomly shuts down or freezes. This is not a quality chromebook. Save your money and your time.\n\n------Original review:\nI have mixed thoughts about this Chromebook. I had the ASUS Chromebook C201PA-DS02 for a little bit more than a year and I loved it until it started to give in. The system was amazing and it gave me exactly what I needed to keep writing my dissertation everywhere I went. However, the shiny plastic seemed flimsy since day one, and it always had a cheap made look. But how could I complain when I could have more than 20 tabs on 3 different windows open with all my dissertation sources and documents, while still being able to stream a movie on Netflix without an issue?! My great relationship with that ASUS made me leaning toward a second Chromebook.\n\nAfter extensive research, I found the aluminum making of this model so attractive, enough for me to ignore the complaints regarding the functionality. The first model I received started to shut down randomly every 1-2 hours the very first day. Then it was more like every 30-40 minutes. If I dared to open more than 8 windows it slowed down so much that it was becoming quite complicated to navigate through pages, or to keep on writing on Google Docs. I ordered a replacement. Then... I had the same issue: this model also shuts down randomly every 1-3 hours (just as I write this review it happened for the third time today). Sometimes I just have to close it and open it again, but when I have to log in and open my documents and pages all over again, I find hard to keep loving the prettiness of this Chromebook. Because indeed it is very pretty, it is the best looking Chromebook on the market... but I think I will have to say good bye to it.\nFurthermore, even though this model does not collapse when I open more than 15 tabs, the keyboard is not as responsive as the first model I received (the space key especially doesn't seem to work as it should). The mouse pad is also not as responsive as the one on the first model. It is a shame, I had high expectations on this Chromebook due to the reviews and the fine making of this aluminium model... but even my now crappy ASUS works better than this brand new Chromebook."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I bought this a week ago. I had never used Chrome OS before but I have always been a google fanboy. The build quality is great and the screen is awesome, blacks are really black. Checking it out at the store I was worried that the text was too small for my eyes. With a little searching I found it was easy to change those setting with a ctrl-shift+ key stroke. This brings in the resolution but viewing pics and viewing videos will still be at 1080p.\n\nI'm not a fan of google docs because of incompatibility issues. You can use office online if you have a 365 subscription, If MS office is a must have, get a windows device. Editing office documents can be done, but it can be a pain sometimes. But it loses one star on this.\n\nNow, the real reason I bought this was the promise of Andoid apps. Well, I'm kinda geeky and I was able to load android apps in developer mode and I must say, the future for this product is awesome. Lots of the apps worked great. Even chatheads works. They are still working on issues such as resolution and screen resizing. But it will be nice to have apps like gmail, google contacts, mx video and many others. A lot of these apps work offline, such as Smart News (well you can read later), Mint, practically most games. It's gonna be awesome I tell ya. They will probably release it sometime early next year based on my observation of current bugs.\n\nAs for the hardware on this. Like I said, great screen (best I've ever had), Keyboard is great, so is the trackpad.  All aluminum body for $269. Can't beat it.\n\nOne big con: The power cord. It's too big and looks easy to break. You spoiled and almost perfect product with a crappy power cord."}

I played Amazon Videos, worked great. Games, great. MS Word Online and Google Docs, great.\n\nThe aluminum chassis is nice, not quite as cool as my wife's Macbook Air, but it is 4x the cost. The hinged cover is not as cool as the chassis, and I would prefer not to have the ACER insignia protruding from the top cover. But, hey...\n\nI think $300 is too much to spend on a Chromebook, but I would do it again in a heartbeat."}

If you want to boot some other OS it has some serious downsides. It is not well supported although that is improving.\n\nI bought this intending to boot Linux on it and use it as a portable workstation for coding. However booting off the eMMC is not yet supported by the available ROM images out there. I am currently working on this issue. Also you must use a Linux kernel that is compiled with the config parameter CONFIG_PINCTRL_CHERRYVIEW=y if you want the internal keyboard to work. Most distros are now using kernels with this parameter though so it is not as much of an issue as when I bought it.\n\nI'm looking forward to it being a functional computer."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "A month or so ago, the screen on my Toshiba Chrome 2 was broken (no fault of the computer, just someone slamming it shut in anger), necessitating its replacement. This Acer is the third computer that I bought in replacement, so I feel I'm in a pretty good position to judge where it stands relative to what else it out there right now.\n\nI'm a Chrome OS early adopter, having bought one of the early Chromebox's that were given out at the Google I/O off of eBay, and having bought my Toshiba Chromebook a couple of years ago. I'm somewhat sold on Chrome, the feature I like best about them is that the continuous updating and cleaning up of the OS. My Chromebox is about four years old and it works better now than when I bought it, and that's with zero attention paid to updating/upgrading/virus protection/etc. ever. It \"just works\" and it doesn't stop just working.\n\nSo my first choice was the SUS C300SA-DS02 Chromebook 13.3\" HD, which sells for about $225 on Amazon. It wasn't a horrible computer, but it looks and feels very cheap and underpowered. So I sent it back and instead ordered an ASUS ZenBook UX305UA 13.3-inch. It was of course much nicer, and I was looking forward to putting Windows Office on it so that I could get some more work functionality out of it. But I was amazed to learn that ASUS Windows laptops, apparently all of them, lock the function keys in such a way that you have to simultaneously press the function key in order to perform their non-function functions (i.e. if you press \"F12\" by itself you get the developer's code window rather than volume up), and it cannot be changed. It's hardwired into the computer, not even opening the BIOS can change it. That was a plain non-starter for me, I'm constantly fiddling with volume and brightness controls on my laptops, so having that as a two-hand operation . . . no way.\n\nSo . . . reconsidering also the extremely marginal functionality of native Windows Office as opposed to Google Docs/Office Online, I decided to go back to another Chromebook, but this time the Acer Chromebook 14. Boy am I glad I did! This computer looks and feels like a $1000 laptop. It's a beautiful, solid all-metal device, with a nice, wide great looking screen. The trackpad works well, and the internals seem to be very quick, I haven't noticed any stuttering on anything as of yet. My only quibble might be with the keyboard, which is a bit shallow for my tastes, but it's decent enough. At $300 even, you'd be crazy to settle for one of the $200+ Chromebook when a vastly better machine can be had for just a little bit more. If you're looking for a computer in the range of this size and price and functionality, I would recommend this one."}

Great decision!\n\nCan't beat the price for the features.\nFast startup compared to any Windows machine I've ever used.\nLong battery life - I've had it on for as much as 9hrs\nVery lightweight. I take this everywhere because it just doesn't seem to weigh anything. This is similar to a MacBook Air in weight.\n\nThe learning curve for this Chromebook is very shallow. I had a friend that visited and who knows nothing about computers and is a MacBook user.\nThe friend needed a computer for an emergency.

To me this was strong validation that the Chromebook concept is great for most computer needs.\n\nI also watch a ton of online TV shows. The sites I use for TV shows from all over the world unfortunately have lots of popup ads and try often to hijack my browsers so virus protections must be up to date and VPNs turned on when I use a Windows computer.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "TL;DR version: this computer is great! It does everything I could ever want a mobile device to do without replacing my desktop! fantastic pricetag too!\n\nI spent many months of painstaking research and so much shopping to find a mobile computer that i could actually like and love.. i was so afraid of buying the wrong device and having it turn into nothing but a waste of space in some junk drawer like my last laptop..\nI do think I finally found the solution but i had to try a chrome book for a while first before i finally decided to buy one because i was a bit afraid that i wouldn't find it useful. boy is chrome OS useful.. in fact i think it's the future. for all computers including desktops\nthings i love about it and are important to me:\n---1080p screen.\n---light weight feels good in my hands\n---14 inch screen. i would have been fine with 13 inch but 14 is a bonus!\n---touch pad works great! i don't have issues with accidental moving or accidental clicking..\n---$300 price tag!!!!!\n---looks freaking beautiful.. as high quality looking as a macbook pro or something.. I love using it.. and it complements my work and home desktop without replacing my desktops. I still like using desktops but now I have this to supplement without replacing the desktop for gaming and serious office work. I never want to use a laptop for serious work or gaming.\n---the chrome os works better than windows in reliability and mobile functionality than windows 10. specifically, when browsing i can navigate forward and backward with a two finger swipe left/right. i can also go between tabs by 3 finger swipe left/right. both of these features are amazing and are not available on any laptop that runs windows 10. Furthermore. windows 10 is way too complicated and takes a lot of work to set up. WIth chrome OS. everything is easy to set up. there are not a million settings to mess with and i like that because it's just a mobile device! i don't want to have to spend tooo much time with it.\n---the selfie cam is wide angle so i can easily have up to 3 people in frame shoulder to shoulder.\n---the mic is good and people hear me well when using video chat.\n---i can use chrome web apps to do most anything.. office 365.. netflix/youtube, hangouts is a good chat app wish more people would use it like they love apple chat so much... i can download movies and watch without internet. google office can be used offline. gmail may be used offline. google keep is awesome. I like how cloud apps sync to the file folder.\n\nthings that might make it better..\n---if it was made of solid single piece aluminum or titanium construction. the touchpad doesn't have a very crisp satisfying click..\n---I think if the CPU was faster, i could load up google slide presentations faster.. there is so much lag when i go from one slide to the next that google slides is essentially not usable on this laptop. I don't recommend this device to anyone who wants to make/edit presentations or read a lot of pptx files. The CPU is just slow for this task. I haven't experience any problems at all for cruising facebook or playing videos.. So I for one find it very strange that reading pptx files on google slides would be so slow.. it's probably a intensive task to convert the slides.. It is also a little slow to load pages on onenote.com. I'm not sure if onenote.com is slow because of internet loading speeds or slow because of CPU though.\n---if it had  a touch screen and ability to flip into a tablet (without the sacrifice of the dell inspiron 7000 series which are really ugly computers in my opinion.)\n---if the speakers were upward facing towards me they would sound less muffled sometimes. generally the speakers aren't very high quality.. but headphone jack is fine.\n---if it had an sd card slot for expandable memory\n---if the hard disk was larger than 32 gigs to store more downloaded movies.\n---a setting to change text size of everything would be nice.. hard to use the device lying down as the text is a bit small when my eyes are 3-4 feet away as they generally are when i try to use a laptop lying down. i can zoom a little in chrome so that can help but it doesn't work with the apps in chrome os. only chrome browser.\n---a back-lit keyboard might be nice\n---maybe if it had a mini display port that would be cool i don't know..."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "This piece of hardware definitely deserves 4+ Stars.  I really like the aluminum cover, the quad core processor loads webpages quickly, and the HD display is crystal clear!  At the time of purchase (Sep 2016) the majority of the chromebooks on the market have dual core processors.  My decision on choosing this model was based primarily on the quad core processor.  My time is valuable, and I don't want to wait for web pages to load.\n\nThe Cons:  No SD card slot, The charging port would be better if it was USB instead of the A/C adapter (the whole point of this thing is mobility, so why have to carry a special charging adapter???), and my final dislike is price.  I think at $300 this chromebook costs more than it's worth (more to follow).\n\nNeither Pros nor Cons:  Size:  this has a 14.1\" screen.  I personally wanted something a little smaller and lighter.  Yes the large screen can be nice, and the keyboard size is great, but there are 11.6\" models with large keyboards and decent displays (every model seems to have a different physical appearance and it's worth looking at these at an electronics retailer).  I was very tempted by an 11.6\" model that weighed in at 2.5 pounds.  At 3.4\" this model is still light compared to the ol' laptop, but still not as portable as some of the smaller units.  Again, I went with this unit because of the quad core processor.\n\nSo WHY woudln't I buy it again???\nI really am displeased with the whole Chromebook platform.  For Web Browsing, this is great, but I didn't do enough research before making this purchase.  I knew that the OS was Chrome, but I didn't know what that really meant.  I assumed that all of my Google apps would transfer to this device like they do on my phone and tablet.  NOPE.  That is completely wrong.  It's funny that my Android phone and tablet have Chrome installed on them, but those millions of Android apps won't run on this device.  The list of Chrome apps is outright LAME.  Be sure to browse the Chrome web store before you make this purchase.  I don't, for the life of me, understand why Google has two platforms for mobile devices.  Software and Hardware developers aren't going to want to create apps for two platforms.  And Android is king.  It makes no sense why Google has these Chromebooks, instead of an 'Androidbook'.  I think if Google wants to sell Chrome as an OS, they need to make it so apps can run on either.\n\nI would consider buying this device again if the cost was lower.  I saw a quad core 13.3\" model, weighing in at 3 lbs, that was in the $230 range, but I didn't buy it because it ran Windows 10, and I really wanted to try something other than Microsoft (I think Chrome is a superior browser to Edge).  I just feel that at this price, I made a lot of compromises.  In hindsight, I think the smaller, Windows 10 device would have been better for me.\n\nI gave a 4-Star rating, because the hardware appears to be well built, and the web pages do load fast.  I like that a lot.  I also like that it boots up in seconds.  I highly recommend looking at these devices at a retailer with lots of options.  I bought this at a big-box store that sold it at the same price as amazon."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "As I write this review I am really torn as to what rating to give the device.  Its kinda like a runner who does not quite hit the finish line.  The hardware was amazing but the Chrome OS had some very annoying shortcomings which were deal breakers.\n\nThe intended use for the Chromebook was one of my homeschool kids.  It was to be used for web surfing, document editing, and videos.  I wanted something that would easily work when I was not at home.\n\nPros:\n- Amazing hardware\n- Great Keyboard, Display and trackpad\n- Amazing battery life\n\nCons:\n- Google Cloud Print\n- Really designed for you to read and write .gdoc files (see below)\n\nHARDWARE: I was amazed at the quality of the hardware for $269.  I liked everything about the hardware.  Keyboard: Great.  Touchpad: Great.  Display: Great.  Battery Life: Amazing.  On the battery life the specs say 12 hours and they are not joking.  I streamed Netflix videos and found that 1 hour of streaming used about 10% of the battery.\n\nSOFTWARE: Ultimately the software is where the device fell short for me.  Though the Chrome OS was easy to use, it had some quirks that were deal breakers for me.\n\nThe Chromebook has 32GB of storage and I was hoping to use it to shadow the Cloud drive.  Like what you do with Dropbox or MS Onedrive.  The issue is that you had to manually select which files would be available offline.  It would not allow you to flag an entire folder for offline access.  If a file was flagged as available for offline there was not real way of knowing which files would be available offline.  When offline unavalible files were grayed out.  (Like I said almost to the finish line but not quite)\n\nThe next issue was with how Google Drive works.  If you open a DOCX file from the cloud it makes a copy as a gdoc file and edits that file instead.  If you edit the file from the local drive then it will read and write DOCX.  (Almost to the finish line but not quite)\n\nThe deal breaker for me was printing.  I don't like how Google implemented printing.  Chrome OS does not print using a driver like you would on Linux, MS, or Mac.  You print to a server.  It could be a Google Cloud ready printer, dedicated Google Cloud print server or PC with chrome up and running.  I own a Cannon MF6160dw which is Google Cloud print ready.  The printer connected to the cloud but I could never print a document.  I never figured out what was wrong.  I did not want to try to set up a print server.  So I was left with the last option.  If you have PC on with google chrome up, then the Chromebook somehow uses the PC as a print server.  (turn the PC off and no printing).  I did not want to leave a PC up in some closet for just printer.\n\nIf you are going to purchase a chromebook and you want to print, I suggest you figure this out in advance.  If you have a Google Cloud ready printer you can try to print to the printer from inside of a Chrome browser.  The review page will not let me post links.  So here are some search where the first his is a good page on Chromebook printing:\n\nsearch: chromebook guide how to print from your chromebook introduction\nsearch: The hitchhiker's guide to chromebook printing"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I didn't feel like paying an arm and a leg when my 9-year old macbook finally bit the dust so I was looking for a cheaper alternative to basically just surf the web on. After reading a lot of reviews I decided to go with this Acer Chromebook. I've had it for about 3 months now and have been very happy with the purchase. It was a very easy switch from a macbook to this chromebook as this is very user friendly. There are a few things to have to get use to (aka not having a hard drive), but it's been great for my needs. The only flaw I've noticed saw far is that when my sound is on mute (which is about 95% of the time) and I click on a website that automatically has a video or sound playing it makes this weird type of electrical screeching/squeaking noise. I've tried to research and see if anyone else has had this issue but haven't seen anything else about it. It doesn't effect the performance, just annoying I suppose."}

I received this Chromebook today and have operated it for at least 8 hours straight and it is not even warm to the touch! It has no internal fan because it will never overheat! That is one less thing you will have to replace a few years down the line. It is very fast, quiet and efficient. I can honestly say that I may never purchase another Windows laptop. No viruses or spyware, instant bootup, no upgrades...Just sheer performance. Having worked in the IT field for 15 years, I think I know a little bit about laptop quality. 8 hours in and I STILL can't put this thing down! Do yourself a favor and buy this thing. You won't regret it!"}

Google docs is all you need, although I have also tried Office 365/Online (Not so good). The screen is a matte IPS and has great viewing angles. There is a gasket around the display that protects it when it closes, which I admire (would not want the top and bottom metal chassis scratching against each other.\n\nKeyboard feels great, it has less key travel than a larger laptop, since it's so thin, but slightly more than the Macbook 2015. Chromebook removes the delete button (ctrl+backspace to delete) and replaces it with a power button that you have to hold to turn on and off, so no accidental loss of productivity.\n\nThe only downside is that the speakers face... well down. Sound is great on the table, but discerning on your lap or couch. But I have bluetooth speakers that work great with this device.\n\nI give 5 stars because I got everything I was expecting and for a great price. It's not a full PC, but it's the cleanest PC you'll get at this price. Better than anything up to about the $700 range I would think."}

I almost bought the Toshiba but a few comments about the terrible customer service made me decide ultimately on the Acer.\nSo far I am very happy but I have not yet used Google Docs nor have I streamed any video.  One think I don't like is that there is no \"delete\" key on the keyboard.  The font is also a bit too small and even though I have changed the settings it doesn't always seem to work.  And I wasn't very happy that Amazon lowered the price from $299 to $269 a few days after I ordered it.  It's great, though, to open the laptop and not have to wait for things to load.  Overall, I would definitely recommend."}

There are Chromebooks with faster processors/better screens/more bells and whistles, but they are usually either compromised by cheap, plastic-y casings and dreadful keyboards OR cost as much if not more than rather nice Windows PCs. If you use your laptop mostly to surf the web and do word processing, and/or you're heavily embedded in the Google ecosystem (esp. Google Drive), then you'll probably enjoy using this thing. I don't yet know if this machine is built to last (although it seems to be so), but at this price point, it doesn't have to run for years and years to be well worth the value."}

A few callouts...\n1-I was hesitant to buy a Chromebook without a touchscreen.  Be sure to consider this when shopping.  Personally, I don't think I would use a touchscreen that much (and haven't missed it thus far).\n2-There are some reviews which mention a poor quality keyboard/key feedback.  While the keys certainly don't have the feedback that a high quality desktop keyboard has, I think the keyboard is just fine and operates quietly.\n3-I listen to a lot of music and the fact that the speakers are on the bottom of the device muffle the sound a lot.  If you don't have it sitting on a desk/flat surface, you'll likely need to use headphones as the speakers are worthless if they're sitting on your lap.\n4-No SD card slot.  A minor issue (it IS a Chromebook, afterall) but, like the touchscreen, should be factored into your decision making process.\n5-The display is pretty awesome but I have noticed a small amount of lag when watching very high-quality videos.  For Netflix, basic Youtube videos, etc, there shouldn't be an issue unless you have a lot of other stuff running.\n\nIn all, I'm happy with the purchase.  The device is lightweight, feels high quality with the aluminum body, and serves the purpose that a Chromebook is intended to serve."}

After a week of use no problems with it, but, there is something wrong with the metal body. For some weird reason, it does not stay flat on a flat surface. Every time I type it gets annoying I have to put some paper under one of the rubber foots. I did the crouton mod and works awesome!!  I have some issues with the trackpad but, since I use an external mouse is not a problem. The trackpad works awesome on the ChromeOS side. I will recommend this laptop for anyone on a budget looking to do office and study work. If you do Rendering Video or some other CPU demanding task stay away from it. By the way, Linux runs super snappy on it."}

No charging light or anything.  I'm an 8-year TV and computer repair technician, so I opened it up and re-seated all the connections (everything looked fine), and after reassembly, still nothing.\n\nI called Acer and explained the problem, we of course tried the key combinations I had already tried.  I told them I had re-seated all the cable connections as well (technically, voiding the warranty), and they offered 7-10 business days for a fix on that unit.\nI explained that this was an evaluation model for my company, looking to purchase 200 units, and that 7-10 business days for a fix on a brand new unit was not OK.  There was nothing to be done about it with the support rep I talked to.  He gave me a case number and mentioned I could return it to the seller (Amazon) if that might meet my needs faster.  He asked if there was anything else he could do for me and I said, \"Unless a manager would like to reconsider this issue and possibly send me a new unit to trade out right away for the sake of my evaluation on which model to purchase a large lot of, then, no.\"  He said that wouldn't happen and no managers would consider it, so that ended that.\n\nI returned the unit to Amazon for full refund as defective and ordered an HP 14-ak050nr (very similar specs, just plastic, not aluminum body).  I'm happy with that one and it has a better reputation.\n\nAs for my review of this actual unit, the look and feel is really nice.  The touchpad is smooth and doesn't sound/feel like hollow plastic (like MOST chromebooks I've used).  Keys feel good and the screen is very pretty.  It's too nice for the price, and Acer's reputation SHOULD have stopped me from trying to get something too good to be true... So anyway, I'm glad I got one of the lemons before I purchased a lot of them and had to deal with all those problems!  What an embarrassment."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "Review of November 2016\nAfter having this Chromebook for three months the charging connection keeps falling out. It is an odd very thin pin charger like maybe 1/6 inch by 3/8. It now fits very loose and literally falls out. I might have to tape it into the charging port. Very disappointed. I like the Chromebook but would not buy this one again and would advise others to think twice about it.\n\nReview of September 2016\nThis is my second Chromebook. I also have a chrome box and bought a Chromebook for my wife. I guess you could say I like Chromebooks. They are really a no-brainer for most people's needs. I love that i do not have to worry about viruses or updates. I also do not need to worry about hardware failure. In my experience, these guys are pretty bulletproof. The book runs plenty fast. For me, there are far more pros than cons to the Chromebook.\n\nSo here are my cons with all chrome books.\nNot enough apps.\nDoes bot run oracle software so I have a financial program I cannot use on my Chromebook. That keeps me still tied to Microsoft.\nI think the point is to get off Microsoft so I wish google would address this and get oracle integrated into the operating system.\n\nHere is my cons with this particular Chromebook.\nI read somewhere that it had a backlit keyboard. Not so.\nIt has glow in the dark letters which are not much of an improvement over normal keyboards.\nIf this had a backlit keyboard I would give it a 5 star. I would happily sacrifice battery time for a lit keyboard or even a few key ltters and numbers lit to index my hand.\nThe keys take a bit heavier stroke than my HP Chromebook so I often find I type the key but it does not register on the screen. I am slowly adopting a more powerful keystroke to make sure I actually get the letters down. It has slowed me down a bit.\n\nAll in all I love my Chromebook but it could easily be better and for three hundred I really think it should be. Also for as long as the chrome operating system has been out it should be better. I think it is one of googles best products yet they have not seemed to invest in advancing the operating system to really compete head to head with Microsoft. In truth, it is a very good e-machine. But for 90 percent of my stuff that is enough."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "Let's start this review with a couple of caveats.  If you are looking for a laptop to do serious gaming on, this is not it, but then no sub $500 laptop will work for you.  If you are a big time photoshop editor, you probably aren't looking at sub $500 laptops either.\n\nNow if you are looking for a good looking laptop to take to the coffee shop to surf the web and edit some documents for work/school/fun, this is it.  It is a little more expensive than your average Chromebook, but the fit and finish of this machine is well worth it.  The aluminum body is good looking and feels great.  Is it a MacBook Air?  No, but close.  It feels substantial, in a good way, in your hands while you hold it.\n\nThe laptop hinges don't wobble and the body sits nicely on a table or your lap.  The keyboard travel is a little shallow, but I like it.  The keys have a nice positive feedback.  The keyboard also doesn't feel cramped and is easy to type on for extended periods of time.  I never miss the space bar and the trackpad is good at ignoring random brushes from my hands as I type.\n\nIf you use Chrome Browsers already then the Chromebook is the perfect extension of that.  Everything gets synced across, between your desktops, laptops, Android Phone, etc.  You can almost pick up where you left off.  Google Docs and Sheets (Word and Excel) work great and are a great sub for the Microsoft versions.\n\nThe screen on this laptop is beautiful and is a pleasure to use, the HD is crisp and the colors are accurate.\n\nGrab this laptop while you can, it is a flagship level Chromebook without the cost of the Dell Chromebook 13 or the Pixel, which are the standard bearers of the family."}

I finally settled on a Chromebook because I have a desktop system that handles the heavier computing applications (adobe suite, editing, pdf file creations).\n\nChromebook seems like the kind of device that you review after a few weeks, and by the time anything happens to it that affects use, the replacement will be just as much or cheaper, twice as powerful, and come with \"Angry Birds\" installed by default.\n\nThe system is quick, and used for browsing, and basic notes. The screen is nice, bright, and at times, almost too big. The keyboard gives a satisfying audible response to being used, and the mouse is nice. Modeled similar to the Mac Book Pro mouse, gestures with multiple digits allow you to navigate windows, tabs, and options.\n\nI'd recommend the following programs:\nCaret - A text editor with configurable settings, syntax highlighting for programming, and an easy to use interface. (similar to Sublime)\nSecure Shell - terminal like plugin for your browser to access remote systems over SSH.\nVNC Viewer- Remote desktop application for remote GUI access.\nDraw.io - Flowchart based program\nVLC - Video media, it'll play everything\n\nRecommended plugins:\nUBlock Origin\nScript Block"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "Great laptop for $300, it feels and looks like it should be $1000. The screen has a matte finish and is full hd which is absolutely gorgeous. For $300 you get a solidly built chassis and a good enough processor to run multiple tabs in chrome along with some word processing. This is a light duty laptop designed for web browsing and word processing tasks, perfect for the average college student. If your college's email system is through Google, this would be a no brainier as you could sign into your school gmail account on this laptop and get desktop and push notifications directly from it. And if you have an android device you can sync them together and you could really stay organized. I was disappointed with the order process, as the laptop was listed as $270 and my order was cancelled for some reason. I had to re-order it for the full $300 price which still isn't bad at all; just wished I could have gotten an even better deal."}

I finally decided on this!\n\n1 Star - Awesome look. I would never say it is MacBook-level design, but it looks great for being a $300 laptop.\n2 Stars - Speed. I am pretty impressed with the speed of this device. I know it is basically just a hyped web browser... but it is exactly what I need. I can do all the heavy lifting on my work laptop.\n3 Stars - The screen is great. Some people think it is too dark. I can see why they would say that. I kind of like darker screens (better for reading).\n4 Stars - Great speakers. Love the keyboard. Excellent battery life.\n\nMinus 1 Star - Setting up my ChromeOS was a bit rocky. I use chrome on other computers and some of the extensions REALLY slowed down my new laptop. Simple web pages were refusing to load. I got rid of the problematic extensions and it sped right up. Also, the size of text and items on the screen was a little strange to me. I adjusted some systems and it looks fine now, but I can see how that might be frustrating to people who just want to open up a laptop and start using."}

I dropped this on a hard floor yesterday and it still performs perfectly.\n  Large screen- This screen is big enough to have 2 functional windows open at one time.\n  Power- I can have multiple tabs open at once with no lag\n  Keyboard- The keys are very responsive and easy to type with.\n  Weight- Lightweight enough to keep on my lap and not feel uncomfortable.\n  Cool to touch- no uncomfortable heat when you have it in your lap.\n  Battery- While I don't get near the stated battery life, it charges very quickly.\n\nCons- Screen- Too dark even at the brightest setting. Also, there is a marked difference in how bright the screen is when it is charging vs unplugged\n  Sound- The speakers aren't loud enough if there is any other noise in the room.\n  Bluetooth- Technically, this has Bluetooth, but it's not very functional. This is my biggest complaint. I like to have a movie on when I'm  working in the kitchen. It's impossible to hear dialog when the fan is on or the dishwasher is running. When I use the Bluetooth headphones that worked perfectly fine with my Samsung Chromebook, the sound starts to sputter even if I'm standing right next to the computer.\n  Jack and USB placement- I wish everything was on the left side, or at least on the same side. I looked at getting a wireless headset, but they are all designed to have the headphone jack and USB ports next to each other.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with this purchase. This is probably the most functional and durable Chromebook for under $300."}

My fault, I should have done my homework and do not blindly trust the Google brand behind ChomeOS.\n- Skype does not work on Chrome OS at the moment of this writing (only text chat is supported). I did not realize it was possible in 2016. Skype was working on my $50 Nokia phone 15 years ago but does not work on ChromeOS? There is no excuse for that, even if Microsoft was unwilling to cooperate. They could have made Android version working on Chromebooks, at least. There are ways to run an Android app on ChomeOS using ARChon Packager, but all latest versions of Skype crash soon after start for me.\n- Ok, they suggest using Hangouts instead. Have you ever tried to explain a non-engineer how to use Hangouts? This is the most underwhelming social/voice product ever. There is almost no way to know someone is calling you and the whole UI is counterintuitive for a non-tech person.\n- You cannot increase the size of shelf icons/notification area, nor Chrome controls size. No matter which font size you choose, these UI elements will not scale. If you lower the screen resolution, the entire picture quality will suffer due to interpolation. I know how much effort Google spends on making their products accessible, how come my mum has to use a magnifying glass to find a bookmark or a Mail icon? Web pages scale well and look just fine, it is only the controls that stay tiny.\n- Webcam quality is OK but not nearly as great compared to macbooks. I realize that macbook is 5 times more expensive than Acer but webcam is not a very costly component and is the only thing that actually matters to many people, why not make it perfect.\n- \"Ok, Google\" voice search works about half of the time. It recognizes what I am saying correctly and displays the search phrase but does not start a Google search for some reason.\n\nWould have been a nice laptop otherwise, just need to wait a few more years perhaps for Chromebooks to mature."}

When Google announced that this Acer Chromebook 14 would be upgraded to use the Google Play apps, I decided to take the plunge on a new one. Relatively speaking, this ain't your grandfather's Chromebook! Much faster response, terrific wifi reception, and amazingly clear screen resolution make this one fine product. One deficiency is the lack of a microSD or an SD slot, but with two USB 3.0 inputs, you can use a thumb-drive style adapter to read microSD cards. I have a device that reads SD and microSD cards and sends the data by wifi, but the trade-off is slower reading speeds. Nonetheless, I am already deeply in love with this new Chromebook and am looking for a good home for my older used model. Oh, I had subscribed for 100GB of cloud storage at Google Drive some weeks before this purchase at about $25 a year. Buying the new Chromebook gave me two years of 100GB cloud storage for free, so canceled the subscription and reduced the price of the new Chromebook by $50. Not bad!"}

The Acer 14 is fast and boots in seconds. It's a little less zippy on web pages with a lot of advertisements but all together it performs well for the price. I was able to go back and forth between Chrome OS and Ubuntu without any problems. I personally enjoy the shallower keyboard but not everyone is a fan. As long as you know how to type properly the lack of a backlit keyboard shouldn't be a big deal but some people find it hard to live without. The trackpad kind of sucks but I prefer using a mouse anyways so this isn't a big problem for me. Build quality is very solid and does not feel cheap. The Toshiba Chromebook 2 may be faster but the last of them are being bought up as you read this. It is increasingly harder to find new Toshiba's and this Acer 14 is the next best thing. I personally believe this laptop is for everyone. Save yourself some money and make the switch to a chromebook. They are the future of consumer laptops."}

I love everything Google, including the browser, OS, and apps.  The improvements in the Chromebook 14 are significant:\n-- The IPS screen is awesome!  It took me a little getting use to the smaller type and higher resolution, but after adjusting I wouldn't go back.  The screen is MUCH brigher, too.\n-- With the other laptops and only 2GB RAM, it seemed slow at times.  The Chromebook 11, especially, needed to be restarted every several hours, likely due to a memory leak.  The new laptop and 4GB RAM has no such problems.  It always seems as fast as the internet connection allows.\n-- The build quality is excellent.  I love the aluminum.\n-- Battery life is excellent.  I get all-day use even with the brightness cranked.\n-- I was a bit worried about the size compared to the ~12\" Chromebook.  The 14\" is a bit larger and only a bit heavier, but it is still very manageable.  Does not bother me at all, and I find it just as portable for my needs.\n\nThe only drawback I found is the lack of an SD Card port.  I have a nice SLR digital camera, and now I'll need to carry an external USB adapter to download my pics.  Not a huge deal as I'm taking more and more pics with my phone, anyways.\n\nBuy it.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "This is my first Chromebook, so I am writing the review as a new Chrome OS user. The Acer Chromebook 14 has great build quality. The metal construction looks very nice and feels solid. Mine has a tiny rough spot on one edge, but I didn't even notice it until I had been using the Chromebook for weeks. My trackpad is very sensitive and very quick. I have had no issues with the trackpad or the screen or anything else. Chrome OS works fine for basic tasks. I don't use Photoshop or any real technical programs, so I have been able to do everything that I want on the Chromebook. The performance of the machine has been very good. I have not experienced any crashes or any unreasonable wait times opening up web pages....etc.\n\nThe screen is a bit dim if you don't turn it up to full or near full brightness. But, the screen is sharp and I prefer the matte screen finish. Some reviewers have stated that the 1080p resolution makes things to small on the screen. In the Chrome OS settings, you can increase font size or put a zoom on the whole screen. It is really not an issue if you put 20 seconds of effort into adjusting the screen.\n\nI use mine regularly hooked up to a TV via an HDMI cable. I have had no problems or lags or anything streaming movies. Also, this Chromebook works with my external hard drive and all of my thumb drives with no setup steps. So, storage is not a problem. The battery life has been excellent. I have never timed it, but it goes on and on and on.\n\nMy only complaints are very minor: I don't really like the web version of Microsoft Office. But, the full Android app store is coming to the Acer Chromebook 14 later this year, so that will solve the problem. I already use the Android Word app on a tablet, so I know that I like that experience more. In fact, since the Android apps are coming, I am even considering buying a smaller Chromebook for traveling and getting rid of the tablet all together. My other complaint is that it lacks a physical \"delete\" key. It only has a \"backspace\" key like on a MacBook. To delete something, you must push \"alt+backspace.\" Google designed the Chrome OS that way, so it is not Acer's fault. It took a little getting used to, but it is not a big deal.\n\nI would definitely buy it again."}

One must consider this is a $300 unit--for a $300 unit, it really is quite amazing. Is it as productive/fancy as a $1,000 computer? No, but for what a lot of people do on a computer (surf the internet, play casual games, watch videos) it's awesome.

Don't listen to someone who says you will not be able to use this for anything other than surfing, or that it won't work when you are offline. It does work offline just like a normal computer and for 99% of users it will do everything you need it to do. And it will do it faster. I would highly recommend. I think chromebooks are a steal, this one in particular."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "Chromebooks have come a long way in a short few years of existence. The first few versions (and most models even now) looked like plastic toy computers with limited capabilities. One of the exceptions was the Google Pixel Chromebook in an all metal chassis, but you had to dish out about $1100 for one. Well all that has changed with this Acer Chromebook 14, that I recently picked up (note: I wouldve bought from Amazon but it wasn't available for shipment and I couldn't wait).\n\nAs I got close to a decision, the final 2 models in my matrix were the Acer Chromebook 14, and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Toshiba-Chromebook-2-2015-Edition-CB35-C3300-Full-HD-Backlit-Keyboard/dp/B015806LMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Toshiba Chromebook 2 - 2015 Edition (CB35-C3300) Full HD, Backlit Keyboard</a>, as both are worthy competitors. After looking at all the specs side by side, here is my net summary.\n\nProcessor: The Acer has the Celeron N3160 vs. the Celeron 3215U in the Toshiba. Both are comparable processors but the N3160 has a slight edge, due to the 2MB L2 cache, and a little faster GPU (320MHz vs. 300MHz). But most importantly, the N3160 is a quad-core processor vs. the 3215U, which is a dual-core. EDGE: ACER.\n\nChassis: The Acer Chromebook definitely has an edge here with the all-metal aluminum chassis that is sleek and thin. Need I say, it looks remarkably similar to a non-chromebook with a model call Air. The Tosh has a plastic chassis in silver color that is also nice to look at, but is not metal and doesnt quite look as premium. EDGE: ACER.\n\nScreen: The Tosh has a 13.3 Full HD IPS screen with 1920x1080 resolution with Intel HD graphics. The Acer has a slightly larger 14 display, that is also Full HD IPS screen with 1920x1080 resolution and Intel HD graphics. EDGE: ACER.\n\nMemory/RAM: Both chromebooks come with 4GB DDR3 SDRAM. EDGE: TIE\n\nStorage: Acer has 32GB onboard storage vs. the 16GB on the Toshiba. Note that this storage will be available for downloading and storing offline content. But the beauty of the Chromebook is that all your data is in the cloud. Still the larger memory size is useful in case you need it for offline content. EDGE: ACER\n\nSD Slot: Given the small onboard storage, the expandable SD slot is a great feature. The Tosh has this slot and you can add Mini/Micro SD cards with content, or for storage. EDGE: Toshiba\n\nSpeakers: Im afraid I cant provide a good comparison of the speakers since I don't have the Tosh unit. But the Acer does have (2) downward firing speakers which sounds very good when the unit is sitting on a hard surface, like a table top. However, if you're web surfing in bed with the chromebook on your lap on a blanket underneath, the speakers do tend to get muffled. Overall though, the sounds quality is good, considering it's coming from some very small speakers. Since I cant compare the two, Ill give this a tie. EDGE: TIE\n\nBattery: Acer claims that their Chromebook gets up to 12 hours, while the Tosh claim is up to 8.5 hours. I didn't try out the Tosh but in regular usage at home, I'm getting about ~8 hours on the Acer with most web browsing and some youtube and/or Netflix streaming. I cant give an edge to either since I haven't tested the Toshiba.\n\nWeight: The Acer Chromebook weighs in at 3.4 pounds, and the Toshiba clocks in at 2.9 pounds. However, keeping in mind that the Tosh has a smaller screen, the weight difference may be justified. EDGE: TIE\n\nPorts: Acer has two USB 3.0 ports, and one HDMI port, while the Tosh has one USB 2.0, one USB 3.0, and one HDMI port. Given that all devices and USB sticks etc don't fully utilize the USB 3.0 standard, the benefit here is marginal.  EDGE: ACER (slightly)\n\nKeyboard: Both keyboards are full size and nice to use. I'm not a keyboard snob, and so Ill reserve the in-depth analysis with key travel specs, etc. However, the Toshiba has a backlit keyboard, which is a great feature if you're surfing at night in bed (can you tell I do this often?), while your spouse is sleeping with the lights out. The Acer does not have a backlit keyboard. EDGE: TOSHIBA\n\nAll other features, such as WiFi, Bluetooth, webcam, and other perks (100GB Google drive, Free Gogo in-flight access passes, etc) were equivalent or comparable so I didn't include them in the review.\n\nSUMMARY: After careful consideration, I chose the Acer because of the larger screen (14 vs 13.3), larger onboard storage (32GB vs 16GB) and most importantly, a gorgeous chassis design that looks and feels very premium."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I have been incredibly satisfied with this purchase. It's everything I would like from a Chromebook. I love the thinness, the aluminum build, and the screen. The battery life is great, and I love the simplicity and reliability of Chrome OS.\n\nI had looked into getting the Toshiba Chromebook 2, but was put off by the quality issues and the lack of responsiveness from customer service others had experienced. I settled on this Chromebook because of the positive reviews, and the quality of the build and features.\n\nWhat some say have been cons vs my experience:\n-Some have said that the quality and brightness of the screen are not great, but I am very happy with the range of brightness and almost never use it at its max brightness. I use it inside but have natural light in the room.\n-Some dislike the lack of a back-lit keyboard, but I think the value was put into other areas of the computer. A back-lit keyboard would have bumped up the price. I don't find it necessary for the way I use it, as I have lights on in my home, and I can type without looking down as well.\n-Lack of SD card, I don't miss at the moment. If I need more storage I will use a USB stick or connect a hard drive. But I haven't needed it, and I don't think I will, as I store everything on the cloud.\n\nWhatever other hangups others have experienced, I can say have not affected me at all. If you can get over the cons others have mentioned, I highly recommend this machine! To me, it's all \"pros,\" no \"cons,\" and a really great value for what you are getting. Do look into Chrome OS first, to ensure it is a good fit for how you plan to use the computer. For the average computer user, it is all you need."}

Using my iPad, I chatted with Acer and Google support on a flight from Nashville to Los Angeles - the entire way!  Acer suggested reinstalling the OS, which I did.  When that didn't work they had no other suggestion. Also, given I reinstalled the OS mid-flight, I had to wait until I was on the ground and had a secure connection to access my account info all over again. I then chatted with Google support.

Scalling down resolution to 1536x864 would make most of the windows blurry. You have to see this how bad it is. Its probably chrome os problem but still forget about changing resolution it will look only ok at standart size.\n\nScreen: this is the worst part, the screen is not holding strong, if you place laptop on your lap and set screen to 60 degreen angle you expect the screen drop drop flat down.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "Finally arrived.  I actually ordered from another vendor because it was $30 cheaper.  Very nice little laptop.  I've never used the ChromeOS before, but I'm actually very impressed.  It manages to do a heck of a lot through the browser.  Being a longtime windows user I found myself trying to do stuff I couldn't.  I'll eventually learn that it's simply an internet appliance, nothing more.  The screen is very nice, smokes my HP laptop.  The case is slick.  It feels like it costs a lot more.  I can't believe that they couldn't throw in an extra few $'s to backlight the screen.  I'd pay $50 more for that.  It's not a deal breaker, but it prevents this beautiful device from being perfect.  UPS didn't deliver until after 9 p.m. so I unboxed this in the dark of my living room.  Fired it up and find you can't see the screen.  I was aware of this before I ordered, but didn't think it would be that big of a deal.  It's not that big of an issue to return the device.  If you can live without the backlight, this is the lappy for you.  If you cannot (like me), the pluses will probably overwhelm this omission.\nUpdated...Still bothered by lack of backlit keys.  Keyboard is okay.  I really like the Chrome OS setup.  It's relatively easy to move files around and I won't lose anything since it's stored in the cloud.  Laptop is fast enough.  The screen looks great, but I can see why people are griping about the font sizes on the display (you have to zoom unless the screen is right up in your face).  Wireless speed is snappy.  I have an AC router, but most of my devices at home are N class.  Didn't think there would be a difference, but the wireless meets the speeds of my wired devices.  I popped in a 128 gig Sandisk thumbdrive for added storage.  Purchased to access work functions while I'm away.  This lappy handles this well.  Still 4 stars.  Fix the keyboard and it'll warrant a 5 rating.\n\nStill going strong after a couple of months.  Really grows on you.  Only recent gripe was due to an issue with a wireless mouse and keyboard combo.  Logitech combo acts flakey when connected.  Mouse intermittently works, keyboard kinda janky.  Works no problem on my Hp Envy.  Not a huge deal."}

First, Chromebooks should be the only type of computer anyone should buy... especially if being used by your older parents or anyone who's sick and tired of computers that store everything locally, viruses, crashing computers, etc., etc.  The build quality is amazing for the price, pretty close to a MacBook Air - not quite, but pretty close.  The IPS display is amazing and it's non-reflective which is another great bonus.  The speakers on this system are unbelievably good.\n\nWhile not as fast as the Chromebook Pixel (I have two of them, btw it's the best laptop out there with the highest resolution screen of any laptop on the market, including any MacBook out there, by far), it's a snappy computer.  By changing the default download directory to your google drive 'downloads' directory, you'll never worry about losing files, losing your computer, or having something go wrong when the system crashes.  Now that tethering is free from your phone, you can have internet anywhere you go.  I have both a Project Fi Google Nexus 6P phone (the bill averages out to about $20/mo, no matter where I travel in the world), and a Verizon Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, so I just tether Chromebooks to my phone when not in range of Wi-Fi... even works great at 200mph on the Japanese bullet trains!\n\nI'm an early adopter, someone who buys pretty much anything and tests it out, and spend around $180K a year on Amazon alone... I could go and get the most expensive computers out there, but trust me, you'll be very happy with this computer, and like I said, it's like being paid to buy this thing so the risk is low.  You'll love it, and once you go Chromebook you'll never go back.  Google really is fantastic and knows what they doing here.  Ah, and again, you'll never get malware, spyware, viruses, etc. on this thing.\n\nMy suggestion as soon as you buy this, or any Chromebook, is to change your downloads directory to your Google Drive downloads folder... set up Google Photos (free unlimited storage of photos, great searching capabilities, and deletes photos from your phone with one click as soon as they're backed up in the cloud), and set up \"Open these tabs automatically\" under settings so that you have all your tabs open automatically as soon as you start your computer... for me, I autostart Google Keep, Google Calendar, Google Voice, MightyText, MixMax, Hangouts, Facebook, Google Inbox, Google News, QuickBooks Online, Feedly, Weather Channel 10 day forecast, Nest (for home thermostats and cameras and smoke/carbon monoxide), Rachio (my sprinkler control system that saved 80% on my water bill), and a few other tabs.\n\nEnjoy this computer... you'll be totally impressed.  Ah, and the keyboard is one of the best in the market.  Wouldn't change a thing except for having USB-C quick-charging."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "How times change... 'Chromebooks' to me used to mean paying 'about $200' for a decent pad that supported 90%+ of my not work related computing activities. And we still have many such Chromebooks in our house and we are still very happy with them but, it turns out, Acer managed for an extra 50% more dollars to make what I would call a 'high end' Chromebook. It is, in turns out, good enough for one of our college-bound kids to make it his main computer. So, let me explain why I believe that this Chromebook is worth its high price.\n\nMIND-BLOWING:\n- The display: yes, it's a true 1920x1080. I was and I still am happy with the standard 1366x768 found on most Chromebooks so the better resolution makes me... more than happy? But it's not just resolution. The picture is crisp, brilliant, color rich and that's shouldn't be a surprise. Acer, after all, is one big monitor maker. The viewing angle is close to the perfect 180 degrees. It's probably 160 degrees but, you get the idea. This Chromebook's display is beautiful.\n- Speed: a 2.24 GHz, quad-core Intel Celeron is not the fastest Intel has ever made but on a Chromebook, because of its natively low overhead it translates into satisfyingly 'fast'. It simply runs rings around most other Chromebooks we keep in the house, a good speed match for our Toshiba Chromebook 2.\n\nGREAT:\n- 802.11ac: if 300Mbps is not fast enough then... 802.11ac can get a little faster, to about 450Mbps. This is our second Chromebook that supports 802.11ac standard and, thanks to the faster processor, it can take better advantage of it.\n- 14\" screen: (vs. 11.6\" for 'classic' Chromebooks) bigger is not always better but, in this case, given the excellent resolution and display quality, it's just great.\n- Skin: it's aluminum, makes it look high end  and super-cool. Also easy to keep clean.\n\nAS EXPECTED:\n- 4GB or RAM: it's okay and Chromebooks work well with this amount of memory. I will not go for a 2GB Chromebook ever again.\n- I/O: 2 x USB 3.0, HDMI out, headphone jack, memory card reader. No complaints whatsoever.\n- Keyboard: as expected. Good for doing emails, probably not good enough if you are planning to write a 300-page novel.\n- Trackpad: is good. Most Chromebooks have good trackpads.\n- Battery life: 12 hours claimed, more like 5-6 hours in my 'real life' tests and that's good enough for me.\n- Camera, internal stereo mic: good, no complaints.\n- Bluetooth: doesn't everybody?\n- Weight: at 3.4 lbs is where a 14\" Chromebook is expected to be, given the aluminum.\n\nDISAPPOINTING:\n- Backlit keyboard... not. Toshiba's Chromebook 2 has them and I just love the feature. All Chromebooks should come with backlit keyboards.\n- Dedicated charger: I am still spoiled by that HP Chromebook 11 of a couple of years ago that could be charged through a USB port which, by the way, my wife is still using and she just loves it. This Toshiba, like most other Chromebooks comes with its own, dedicated (little) power brick so it's a small disappointment.\n\nAs far as my experience with the product, the first adjective that comes to mind is 'flawless'. I didn't time it but I'm sure it took less than 5 minutes between pressing the power button, connecting to Wi-Fi and entering my email address and password for the Chromebook to be activated, fully updated to the latest Chrome OS version and to have all my extensions and shortcuts loaded and ready to go, giving me my full, familiar Chromebook interface, only faster and brighter in this case. It is able to handle Netflix, Youtube and some streaming news channel and it's like is asking for more. The keyboard is what it is: chiclets but well made and the backlit makes all the difference in the world.\n\nWithout a doubt in my mind, Google's own Pixel aside (which is way overdone) this is one of best Chromebook I've ever experienced.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nTHOUGHTS ON CHROMEBOOKS\n\nThose who already use Chromebooks probably don't need to read this but for anyone new to Chromebooks, please be aware that this is NOT a Windows laptop. It's probably worth Googling (or Binging) 'Chromebook' before deciding on getting one but, here are some of my thoughts on the matter. Also, jusb because it's made by Google, it does not mean that it's going to run all of Android's apps even though Google does plan to make this possible in the near future.\n\nWhy a Chromebook?\n\nThere's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about a not so expensive device here because, yes, anything that costs 3-4-5 times as much should do SOMETHING better or very few of us would pay more for such devices.\n\n' My Chromebooks is by far my most used computers in the house excluding work hours and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.\n' They are malware, spyware, adware-free. Since nothing is really 'installed' on a Chromebook and not much is physically stored on it, it would be very hard for one to be infected. It is now my habit to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs on Chromebooks only, never on a phone, laptop or tablet.\n' Extremely safe OS. I don't know if this is common knowledge but Google is constantly challenging hackers to crack their OS. As far as I know, Chrome OS wasn't cracked yet.\n' Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns of compromising privacy. If you have a Google account, you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment in seconds and it all goes away once you sign out or turn your Chromebook off.\n' Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chrome OS every few weeks and I found my Chromebooks actually getting better all the time rather than slowly fall into obsolescence.\n' Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while, they tend to get very busy once I turn them back on, downloading and installing various patches, updates and upgrades. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place they don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.\n' The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.\n' Chrome OS is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.\n' Chrome OS being such a streamlined one, browsing and running apps on a Chromebook is faster than off a PC/laptop/tablet of equivalent specs.\n' Relatively low price,  excellent display and lightweight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.\n\nWhy not a Chromebook?\n\nYes, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, Chromebooks are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video for a living or do some hard-core gaming. There are other machines and devices better suited for such tasks. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful and versatile but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one I most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'."}

But for now, I can't recommend it.\n\nUpdate 06/03: The new one arrived and the screen issue is definitely gone! That makes me so happy. So I changed my review from 2 stars to 4 stars. Keep up the good work Acer!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "This is my first Chromebook computer, and I have to say, I am quite pleased with it.  Previous computers I have owned in this price range were netbooks and were a bit small.  This one has a screen and keyboard that are large enough to be comfortable and the screen is bright and sharp.\n\nThe HDMI output is a very nice, up to date feature, giving much better quality video and sound than the old VGA outputs.  I also like the fact that it has two USB3 ports.  The other output is a plug for headphones and microphone.  This is really about all that I need.\n\nI noticed that one reviewer was not pleased with the build quality, but I found it to be very good quality.  Especially considering the price range of this system!\n\nI am still getting used to the Chrome OS system.  It is very different and much simpler than Windows,mbut seems to do just about anything that I need right now.  It is more similar to the iPad IOS than it is to Windows in ease of operation.  It just will not run Windows software, but does about anything else that most users need.  There are lots of apps available at very low cost, although not as many as for IOS.\n\nOne thing that I did not like compared to the iPad was that the mail app is only for Gmail, but can be set up with different email inboxes as long as the email service uses POP protocol.  The Chrome Email app will not handle IMAP protocol.  I finally figured out that, that even IPAM services can be set up to forward their email to an inbox that can be used by the Chrome email system.  So,meow I have essentially the same functionality as in my iPad.\n\nOne other useful capability is that for those who want a tried desktop operating system, it is possible to set this Chromebook up to run Ljnux alongside of the Chrome OSmand you can quickly switch back and forth between the two operating systems.  So, if you are a Linux fan (which I am) you can have a Linux/Chrome laptop!\n\nAll in all, I am very impressed with the power and capabilities built into such an inexpensive laptop.  Easily comparable to systems costing two or three times as much as this system does.  Excellent blend of power and value!"}

I had the Chromebook for about 2 weeks and it was fine.  I plugged it in overnight to charge and then when I tried to start it next morning nothing happened.  I contacted support and they had me try various resets to no avail - no power lights or charging lights.  Support told me I had to send it in at my expense.  I had to pay for it myself on a new device that I've only had for a few weeks and was just released by Acer.  I'd like the same opportunity to be reimbursed for my shipping as the other person got for my faulty Acer Chromebook 14.  Please be aware that there seems to be some manufacturing problems with this laptop.\n\n--------\n\nUpdate: My Chromebook has been sitting in an \"under repair\" status since June 1st.  I contacted Acer a few days ago and apparently they are waiting for repair parts.  I could not believe a brand new model has no spare parts in stock for repairs at a company the size of Acer and they won't simply replace mine with a new one.\n\n---------\nUpdate: Just received unit back.  They had to replace the system board which had fried.  The bad thing was there was a delay because they had no spare parts in stock so repair took quite a while.  So far it appears to be working fine but I have not tried charging it yet which is when the system board fried."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I bought the Chromebook 14 directly from Acer since Amazon is sold out at the present time. I wanted a device which I thought would get the new Google Play integration relatively soon. This laptop is a beast all the way around and its a beautiful device. Some of the pluses I have seen are the amazing build quality and its \"fit and finish\", the battery life is superb, its 4gb of memory and 32gb storage means I can load Linux through Crouton on it and perhaps get a full Linux desktop instead of the CLI tools. Some have commented on the lack of a backlit keyboard as a minus. To be honest, this has not been a major factor for me. Another thing which does take some getting used to is the physical size of the thing. Its bigger than the other chromebooks I've had and the first few days I was more aware of this. I don't know either of these things are negatives though. What I think they are is the evolution of the species called chromebook. Chromebooks are gonna change significantly through this year as the Android apps become available. I think that this is one of the first of a new wave of devices which will leverage the unique aspects of both Chrome OS and Android and we will see devices which tip the scales of build quality, use, and function. The Acer 14 is the first such device to me. This also seems to sound the death knell for tablets across the board. We read that to be productivity devices we need a few functions which a chromebook already does by default. Combine with excellent and evolving panels, keyboards, touchpads, decent networking; it means the whole reason to buy a tablet changes. We'll see where it goes next. What I know now is that this chromebook is a great deal for the price point. You will get the play store on it if that matters. To me it does."}

The machine features 2 USB Superspeed (3.0) ports, full size HDMI, power and audio as well as a Kensington lock port.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "Edit 5/27/2016 to below...\n\nAfter writing this review, Acer contacted me and got me in touch with a real support contact. We briefly discussed the issue and they decided I definitely should send it in for repair (a battery replacement). They gave me a prepaid FedEx label and contacted me when the Chromebook arrived at their repair facility in Temple, TX. So far, I'm happier with the support experience. I'll add a star for this.\n\nAfter I get the computer back (and have the opportunity to actually use it), I'll update this to a product review vs. a service review. I won't knock the device because I think it's reasonable to expect *some* units to have manufacturing issues... it happens!\n\n------------------\nWell we had the thing 10 days and it's dead. Worked out of the box, charged it to full.\n\nThen, unplugged it for a day or so without really using it. Battery got down to 20% roughly so I just turned it off.\n\n2 days later, I tried to plug it in.... dead. No charging indicator (it's supposed to light up blue near power port while charging), cannot turn the device on.\n\nHere's the worst part: contacted Acer support by phone. The first rep seemed to be somewhat helpful, and put me on hold to make notes. We got disconnected so I called back and got a different person named \"Manuel\"... who was NOT helpful.\n\nEssentially he told me to buy another AC adapter at a \"computer store\" or take it to a big box store and try to plug it in. I found this to be a ridiculous response.\n\nI pressed the issue and said it needs to be looked at and repaired/replaced.... it's 10 days old for crying out loud!\n\nHe gave in and created a ticket and sent a return instruction email.... but I'm supposed to pay return shipping. This isn't my idea of how a warranty on a brand new product should work."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "This Chromebook is an absolute pleasure to use.  I enjoy how quiet it is. The track pad is nice. It registers light taps, smooth gesturing, and a nice click. Drag and drop could be smoother, but that's just nitpicking. The keys function very well and I've had no issues with typing.\n\nThe screen is lovely. I've watched 1080p videos and they look crisp and move fluidly. The speakers give a nice sound at \"normal\" listening levels. You will get distortion at 100%, but that's expected.\n\nFor what I use a Chromebook for, the absence of a SD card slot doesn't bother me. Since that's a matter of preference and Acer's decision not to include one, there's no need to dock points. The USB 3.0 slots work just fine. I don't see myself maxing the 32gb onboard storage for what I use a Chromebook for.\n\nAnd that is what it is, a Chromebook. It's irrelevant to compare it to anything else. If ChromeOS works for you, then it simply works. The Google family of apps and extensions (as well as third-party apps and extensions) work for me. The addition of the Play Store in the future will only enhance the experience. Great things to come.\n\nFinally, it's a stunning piece of hardware. It begs you to keep it clean and be responsible. Quality craftsmanship and even the hinge folds flat. There's a nice weight to it. Definitely portable. Expect a few nods of approval from your spectators. Certainly enjoy this Chromebook for years to come.\n\n*Note: For those wondering about battery life, it is excellent! <see photo>"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "Heres my impression of the fifth Chromebook in my life.\n\nChrome OS - I love Chrome OS, but the only issue is printing. To print from it you need a cloud ready printer or sync up to a computer connected to a printer via the google cloud print settings.\n\nBuild/Materials - The aluminum body makes it feel like a premium product. It feels solid in hands and relatively lightweight. This is probably the biggest reason why people purchased this. Its beautiful compared to the plastic chromebooks that we are all used to.\n\nScreen - The 14\" display makes it easier to see pages when its on your lap compared to smaller chromebooks. I love having more screen real estate than the 11.6 inch that I am used from my Acer C740. Colors are on the warm side, but everything looks beautiful, I really like this screen. Brightness is satisfying and sufficient, no issues. The matte screen is not as crisp as a glossy screen, but you won't notice it unless you have them side by side. Viewing angles are better than any TN panel screen, haha. You'll love the screen.\n\nTrackpad - Large, easy to use, firmly held in place (not like the loose pads of the C720s and C740s). Some people say it lags, but I have not had any issues with the precision of the trackpad nor have I noticed any lag that impacts my productivity.\n\nKeyboard - Key travel may be shallow compared to others, but it is negligible to me and it is comfortable to type on. This keyboard is definitely an upgrade compared to other Chromebooks. Theres no backlit keyboard, but this only an issue when using number keys and the row above it in a room with no lighting. Overall keyboard is great, I really enjoy typing on it.\n\nSpeakers - Sound is balanced between highs and lows, but I wish it was louder at its max, but that might lead to sound distortion. The speakers are underneath and facing down so the sound gets smothered when its sitting on your lap and you may find yourself increasing the volume. When its on a desk the sound is nice and sufficient. Speakers are acceptable, they will not blow you away, if you're an audiophile they will leave something to be desired.\n\nStorage - There's no SD card slot on this chromebook, if thats a problem get a USB memory card reader ($6 on amazon).  I only used the SD card slot for one use on my C740 - to reload the OS after upgrading the hard disk size. You cant upgrade the hard disk due to being the soldered type, which is a huge disappointment because it doesnt have an SD card to expand storage... really Acer!!! 32GB is sufficient for my needs but I can see this being an issue for others.\n\nPerformance - Performance is acceptable but will not impress you if you have used other chromebooks....and may even be a disappointment for some. If constantly surfing from page to page, it may feel sluggish compared to the Acer C720 & C740 and Toshiba Chromebook 2 2015. Once pages are loaded working within them is no issue, its the load times that will annoy you if you're spoiled from fast chromebooks. Its really noticeable on graphic/content rich sites like amazon, so It does get annoying because I do lots of shopping on amazon - the pages show up quickly, but doesnt complete loading until several seconds, so you have to wait to hover over pics to view them (Its not a bandwidth issue as this is not an issue on my C740). Having multiple tabs open isn't an issue because the 4GB of RAM helps with multitasking. Video streaming - runs 1080p Youtube videos just fine. I have Chromecast and I've streamed pages with videos from this computer and found that watching videos and surfing the web really hampers the performance, that's another disappointment. Fanless processor - no noise, love it. At first I was disappointed with the performance (coming from a Acer C740), but after a week of only using this chromebook it has grown on me...unfortunately every time I use the Acer C740 I am reminded of the performance flaws of this one. I plan to do some chrome flags tweaks to get pages rendering faster (hopefully). Battery Life was my primary motivator in getting this one over the Toshiba Chromebook 2 2015. Its estimated at 12hrs but real world performance varies by usage (videos will drain it faster). Octane scores are 7,900 or so, the Toshiba Chromebook 2 2015 (with Celeron) gets Octane scores of 17,000 or so.\n\nPrice - The chromebook is definitely worth the $300 it is priced for. Its a lot of bang for your buck.\n\nTHOUGHTS - If you're looking for the best screen on a chromebook with more pep in performance get the Toshiba Chromebook 2 2015 (the only downside is the plastic materials and battery life at 8-9hrs. If you want the longer battery life (12hrs), aluminum body, and more screen real estate, with moderate performance, get this one. If you're looking for the fastest processor with the most battery life (12hrs), and a great display, get the Dell Chromebook 13.  Acer will be releasing the Chromebook 14 for Work which will give you the backlit keyboard, the SD card slot and all the performance you'll ever need (i-series processors), and up to 13 hours of battery life - yes, a beast and everything you want in a chromebook. Unfortunately the release date is unknown at this moment."}

But it does have some rough edges.\n\nThe stand out feature, by far, is the screen. An excellent 14\" IPS display at a full 1080p resolution on the version I reviewed. It's bright, clear, and just a pleasure to look at. It will also fold all the way flat to the surface of a desk or table so it is very adjustable. Quite nice especially given the price tag.\n\nBut it's not perfect. I was surprised to see it lack an SD Card slot. On Chromebooks that slot can be very useful as a means of augmenting its limited onboard storage for playing back media, etc. The trackpad is not as precise as it could be and doesn't register smoothly when dragging windows around on screen. The keyboard is nice with its large well spaced keys but the travel distance could be a little bit better on them. I also have not yet been able to get anywhere near the advertised 12 hours of battery life - so far I've been able to get around 8-10 hours.\n\nPerformance is good for most web browsing tasks. Sites with a heavy amount of advertising and javascript might take a little longer to load but overall the basic browsing experience is good. It would be nice to see faster processors being offered in this form factor.\n\nThose issues aside it's actually a great computer for the price - especially with that gorgeous 14\" display. Be sure to do your research on ChromeOS before buying, it's a very different experience if you're moving over from a Windows PC."}

It is full HD and the colors / angles are great.\n\nIf you are in the market for a chromebook, I simply don't see another version with this construction combined with these specs to match it.

Initially it is only coming to 3 CB's in mid-June but it will roll out later in 2016 to many others. Acer CB3-431 series was on the Google Chrome support site as one of those. I can't wait! This really changes what Chromebook is capable of.\n\nUpdate 5-20: I asked Alexa when I would get my order and she replied that it would be \"Tuesday, July 5th\". I certainly hope she is wrong! '\n\nUpdate 5-24: It arrived today and in I had it set up within a couple of minutes! As Google knows all my bookmarks and passwords it was a breeze to get started. I'll just have to learn some new shortcuts and commands. I LOVE the keyboard. I'm a typist pre-computer days and I don't look at the keys when I type so back lighting is not an issue (but I am sort in a darker room right now and the light from the screen would seem to be enough illumination anyway). The track pad is fine, too -- I don't understand how it is not slick or smooth enough. At any rate, Day 1 and I am very happy. This is replacing my iMac as my main computer and for $800 less and I can definitely say this is just as good of a product. Thank you, Acer and Google for a stellar job!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I've been contemplating the jump to Chrome OS for a while. I do 95% of my computer work on a Chrome browser anyway, so I couldn't see why this would be limiting. And in the end, my initial though was right- I am not really missing anything. For any \"heavy-duty\" work, I still have my overclocked Win 10 desktop.\n\nThis Chromebook is zippy and runs smoothly and quietly (there is no fan). The build is definitely nice, not Macbook nice, but a huge step over your typical plastic-y laptop. The 14\" screen is not too big at all and it seems to be the right mix of screen vs size/weight.\n\nI do have two criticisms- first the downward speakers sound a little muffled, but then again, it's a laptop so I wasn't expecting too much. Then secondly, the screen could use a boost in brightness. The colors seem to be pretty accurate, and the sharpness is good, but I find myself at around 70% brightness and up. I can usually dip below 50% on a Macbook without issue...but this isn't too big of an issue as I hardly use a laptop in an outdoor/very bright environment.\n\nSome reviews knock the keyboard on this Chromebook. I can see why, as the key travel is a little shallow. But it isn't horrible- definitely usable.\n\nOverall, this is worth the $299 MSRP (sad that I pre-ordered and had it shipped, only to see this drop to $273! It's a steal at that price)."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "This is a very preliminary review of the Acer Chromebook 14 . The Chromebook was very easy to set up , but as the whole OS, the keyboard ,mousepad and browser are new to me it is still a pretty steep learning curve. The initial terms were in such tiny print that I can only hope that bI have not signed away any major organ. I did find out how to make the font size larger  so I can read the screen now . I am old, myopic and arthritic so younhgr people will probably find it a lot easier to master than I am. I tried to write this review with the Chromebook but had to switch to the Kindle Fire as I have not gotten the hang of it yet.  The mousepad requires quite a bit of pressure to click on and is painful to operate. Anyway I will be back in a few days when I have had a chance to check out some apps  and get more familliar with the Chromebook and also give the kids and grand kid a chance to try it out as they adapt to new yrch faster than I do."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I ordered the first one and out of the box the computer looks amazing. However, at the bottom of the screen you could see a bit of glue and upon inspection the bezel wanted to separate a tiny bit revealing more glue that appeared to not be dry. I returned the first and now to the second one. There is no glue on the screen but the bezel separation revealing what seems to be wet glue is there again. I am going to deal with this and I hope it doesn't cause problems later. Other than that screen is amazing, keyboard incredible, and the touchpad is wonderfully sensitive.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "The initial feel for this chromebook is superb.\n\nBut they didn't make it $300 by wasting money, there are compromises. So far I think they made very good choices.\n\nThe 1080P display is very sharp. You can watch 1080P video on it and it looks great. There are 1080P dispays that\nare brighter and have a wider range of colors displayed. But unless you prepare color ads for a living you probably\nwill not notice the difference. I find the picture more watchable than my TV. I can see where my LG V10's display is\nslightly sharper. brighter, etc. - but I'll be watching movies on the 14\" display rather than on my phone.\n\nThe audio is great. I don't use headphones to watch movies or listen to music.\n\nThe keyboard is good, on par with other HP and Acer laptops I've had, and only slightly below my MacBook Pro.\n\nThey did sacrifice the SD card slot, but you have 2 USB 3.0 ports that support bus-powered drives without a problem.\n\nThe Quad-core Celeron N3160 gets a respectable near-8000 Octane score. There are chromebooks that have higher\nscores in the same price range. But the 4 GB of RAM makes the things you use a chromebook for work without delay.\nIn my evaluation the main time you'd notice that this is slower than the Toshiba Chromebook 2 is when you are running Octane.\n\nWhere they didn't sacrifice is on build quality. This is a solid, well-balanced design. The all-aluminum design is the one\narea where they went all in."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I bought this as an upgrade from my Acer C720 Chromebook because of the 1080p IPS panel and the aluminium chassis (the TN panel on the C720 had horrible viewing angles and was 768p). I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is. It is effectively better than the C720 in every way for me.  The aluminium chassis is a perfect balance of structural integrity and lightness. This Acer Chromebook 14 is by far the best Chromebook 300 dollars can buy. It might only be beaten by the Chromebook Pixel in terms of built quality, but even that is put to shame by the price-performance ratio of this Chromebook 14.\nAs for software, ChromeOS is a decent thin-client operating system which can do more than most people think. With Chrome Remote Desktop I am able to play turn-based video games such as Hearthstone or Civ 5 while miles away from the computer actually running them. It is also very GNU+Linux friendly if you want to replace the OS entirely.\nOverall this Chromebook is perfect for my current use-case and would recommend it to anyone in the Chromebook market with 300 dollars to spare."}

I had to wait a long month to get it after I preordered but it was well worth the wait. In response to some of the complaints I've seen online for this Chromebook; I don't really have any use for a backlit keyboard so that's a non-issue for me, I never used an SD card on my old Acer so the lack of an SD card slot on this one isn't a problem (it has 2 USB 3 ports and I use flash drives anyway), I always felt the screen brightness on the 15 was a bit much, I always had to turn it down 5 or 6 clicks every time I booted it up, I still turn the screen down 3 or 4 clicks on the 14 so while it is not as bright as the 15, it's not as bad as you may think. But on the other hand, I do notice it isn't quite as fast as my old Acer 15. That's not a deal breaker for me but keep in mind it is a noticeable difference even on light duty tasks. On the other hand, it is the perfect size for me. It is much more comfortable to sit in my lap while I'm in bed watching TV and the charger is a lot smaller too so it is easier to find a sleeve or pouch you can fit the charger in. Not that you'll really need it, this one has much better battery life than the 15. Over all if you want something larger than the 11\" and 13\" models and you think the 15\" is just a bit too large, this is a great compromise. I highly recommended it."}

The Chromebook is built well but doesn't really come close to the Macbook Air which is built out of a solid piece of aluminum, unlike the Chromebook. But for $300 it is likely the best you can get. For a bit more, however, I bet the Dell Chromebook 13 is better, though I haven't used it to really say.\n\nWhile Chromebook's screen is really nice--bright and high res. I found the text to be a little small--but that can be adjusted. The keyboard felt pretty good too, and the speakers sounded decent (they are placed on the underside). The only downsides to the machine is that it lacks an SD (microSD) card slot, so you're stuck with 32GB and whatever you can plug in to the USB. The storage is also non-upgradeable emmc unfortunately, and I don't think anything, even the battery, can be replaced if needed. That's one reason I went with the Chromebook 15 which has a user-upgradeable m. 2 SSD and battery."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "The Acer Chromebook 14 packs a lot of value into a small package. For some background: our household has a couple Macbook Pros and a decent gaming computer. Even with the higher end laptops, this could definitely replace the 13\" Macbook Pro for us (which is primarily used for web browsing) at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe aesthetics of the machine are quite pleasing. It is very thin (comparable to a Macbook Air) and quite light. The screen resolution and quality is very nice (even outside the price point)-- if the icons/ web browsing is too small for older eyes, you can easily change the resolution or change the magnification in the browser; both work quite well. There are some stickers on the device which can be removed (and it looks much nicer with them taken off).\n\nDespite its slim body, it still feels sturdy-- definitely has a premium feel to it. The keys don't have much action (which is preferable for me, but some may not like it). The aluminum body is much more pleasing both in feel and in appearance than its mostly plastic counterparts.\n\nAs for the OS, it is quite snappy. The main component I was concerned about the Celeron processor in this machine, but it has greatly exceeded my expectations. Even demanding or heavy websites load quite quickly and are very smooth to interact with. There are a plethora of Google apps which can be used on the machine (photo editors like Pixlr, remote desktop clients, offline versions of Google apps like Docs, Plex, etc). You can take a look at what else it available for it on the Chrome Web Store, but I would look at these apps as gravy: the prime experience here is having a magic internet box which boots up almost instantly (about 6 seconds by my count) and just works.\n\nWhether you are using this for home web browsing or purchasing for a less tech-savvy relative, I would definitely recommend this whole-heartedly. This machine is cheap in price only-- definitely looks and feels high quality."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I have been using both the Acer 14 and Toshiba 2 2015 for the past few weeks.  There are some trade offs but in the end,  I kept the Toshiba 2 2015 because it has a 30% better display,  better speakers, and a faster cpu.  The Toshiba's fan was a turn off at first but I can live with the low humming sound.\n\nI still have my working Windows HP Pavilion dv9000 laptop that is more than 10 years old and wanted a new media consumption device for e-mailing, youtube, researching, and streaming movies. For battery health, I will keep my chromebook plugged-in most of the time and use a few cycles (about 300%) every month to keep the battery cycles down to prolong battery life. It's recommended to use the battery every now and then but don't let it go under 20%. I charge it often at levels of 50%, 70%, or 90%.  Both laptops get about 9 hrs of battery life if use both at 45% screen brightness.  Hopefully this battery can last me for 10 years.\n\nI usually keep the display for the Toshiba at 50% screen brightness for videos and 40% for browsing. For the Acer 14, screen brightness at 60% which is equivalent to Toshiba's 50% brightness.  The display image, contrast, and colors are more vibrant on the Toshiba.  The Toshiba has a better horizontal viewing angle, at about 90 degrees, so two people can watch a movie side by side. The Acer has a smaller horizontal viewing angle of about 50 degrees for just one person to watch a movie and beyond that, the display becomes too dark to view. The Acer's N3160 cpu is adequate and loads webpages as fast as the Toshiba's 3215U cpu.  Some HD videos ran glitchy on the Acer and smoother on the Toshiba.\n\nAcer pros:\n- less heat under the laptop whereas the Toshiba was alot hotter on my lap (feels 15 degrees cooler)\n- fanless, Love the quiet laptop,  but love the Toshiba more bc of the DISPLAY, CPU, AND SPEAKERS\n- larger display with anti-glare for comfortable viewing\n- great for watching sports (whites are more accurate on this screen)\n- keyboard better spaced out than the Toshiba, I type more accurate on the Acer\n- camera is 3 times better than the Toshiba camera where as you can barely see yourself with the Toshiba's camera\n- aluminum case seem more durable\n\nToshiba pros:\n- better color gamut display\n- display is sharper and clearer, the Acer has about 70% of Toshiba's picture quality\n- faster cpu (loads advertisements faster)\n- about a 90 degrees horizontal viewing angle compared to Acer's 50 degrees viewing angle\n- touchpad is more accurate and does not slip out of place like the Acer\n- AC adapter cord built stronger and is longer than the Acer's AC adapter cord\n- audio speakers are clearer with better highs and lows\n- hdmi connection more reliable than acers (acers hdmi connection has screen blackout often on my hdtv)\n- 1/2 lb lighter than Acer\n- smaller dimensions makes it more portable (more easy to carry around)\n\nImprovements I would like to see in future chromebooks:\n- UHD display price at $299 and below for a nice chromebook\n- fanless design for quiet operation\n- wider horizontal viewing angles over 120 degrees so 2 people can watch movies side by side in bed\n- no heat on the underside of the laptop to place on the lap (design cpu towards topside)\n- faster cpu with octane score with at least 15,000 and up\n- 100% color gamut/sRGB display (1080p is adequate for now)\n- a much clearer and sharper display with anti-glare like the Sony Bravia HDTV\n- audio speakers facing upwards not down into my lap\n- audio speakers with better highs and lows\n- lighter in weight like 2.2 lbs max\n- a 15 ft or longer AC Adapter cord\n\nThank you Acer for building a good chromebook but the Toshiba 2015 is still better."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I received this device on Friday, as promised. I fully charged during first use and despite the fact I've been running it on and off to write, to watch videos, to surf the internet, and to check my email, it's Sunday evening and I have over 71% battery life remaining. So confident in the product, I brought it out with me without bringing the power cord. I love this Chromebook. The screen is wonderful and though I believed the brightness might be an issue, I was able to write outside without any trouble. It was a bright, sunny day here today. I opened a doc and wrote for about twenty minutes and I didn't even have to bump up the brightness, which is set at about 55-60%. Since I was outside and away from a wireless signal, I turned off the wi-fi at this time. I've been leaving the wireless on and haven't plugged in the Chromebook since it reach a full charge on Friday.\n\nI never had a MacBook Air and I'm not in IT (though I had majored in Information Systems for a few semesters before changing over to Organizational Management.) That being said, I've seen a few reviews on here from people who have had MacBooks. I understand this is a Chromebook and only costs $299 but I feel this is a tremendous value. I can't see how it actually compares to the MacBook but since it costs considerably less, I don't have any expectations that this is a superior device. I have had no complaints, I've seen no imperfections in my device, no creaking or flexing anywhere, it has a solid aluminum construction, it runs silent as it is fanless (which means I can type in bed while my wife sleeps), and I find it has an excellent keyboard. Would I have liked a back-lit keyboard? Yes. Do I regret my decision? Not a chance and I don't think that omission warrants a star deduction, not even a half star. I knew what I was getting when I ordered it and I'm pleased to say, it's even better than expected. It runs quickly without experiencing lag (I've had up to 8 tabs open, with Netflix playing in one of the tabs and Google+ open in another.) I don't typically have that many tabs open at one time so if it can handle that, I'm confident it will work great for my use. I'm ready to start removing the stickers from the unit and will throw away the box it came in when I get back home, as I don't plan on returning it. I plan on using this Chromebook daily and give my enthusiastic recommendation! Oh, by the way, I thought I'd miss the SD card slot but really I hardly ever used it and since it has two USB 3.0 ports, if I need to transfer data to my Chromebook, I can always use a flash (thumb) drive, an external hard drive, or share data through Google Drive from another computer.  Guess not having that slot doesn't impact me as much as I thought. If you need this slot, or prefer a backlit keyboard, I would suggest you buy something else. For everyone else, I honestly think you'll love it as much as I do."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "For 299 you seriously can't beat this chromebook.  Is it perfect? Almost. The only thing missing in my opinion is a backlit keyboard but I guess they had to skimp on something to make this available at this price point.  I also purchased the new Toshiba 13\" chromebook and had these two side by side. The Toshiba has a slight edge in screen quality.  The colors seem to pop more in general and it has a slightly warmer tone to it.  The Acer has more of a matte screen and a \"cooler\" color tone but I really felt the Acer being easier on the eyes.  Performance wise they seemed the same to me with general use.  The keyboard on the Toshiba also is slightly better with a better typing feel and of course the backlit keyboard.\n\nIn the end I decided to keep the Acer based on a few reasons.  First the overall feel and construction of the Acer makes the Toshiba feel like a toy.  I had a macbook pro before this and I can honestly say the Acer feels pretty damn close in overall feel and quality.  That's just crazy for something at this price-point.  The Toshiba really felt cheap. The plastic body almost felt like cardboard.  Kind of a shame really considering everything else on it shined.  Last but not least the touchpad.  I don't use a mouse so I need to have a good touchpad experience.  The touchpad on the Acer feels close to the macbook pro I had which needless to say is fantastic. The Toshiba touchpad felt cheap and gave too much friction on your fingers.  Big letdown.\n\nOh one more thing.  I noticed the Acer connects to wifi a lot quicker coming out of sleepmode compared to the Toshiba. At times I had to wait a good 30 seconds for the Toshiba to connect which got annoying.  The Acer connects a lot quicker.\n\nWell there you have it.  This Chromebook is insanely good for the price and if you are looking for one at this price-point you owe it to yourself to give it a try. It really feels like an expensive high end machine.  Kudos to Acer for making something like this possible for under 300 bucks."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "As I write this, the Acer Chromebook 14 is sitting with 13 reviews, all of which are 5 stars... and I do feel a little bit bad here breaking up the perfect game, but after using this Chromebook for a few days, I feel I have an obligation to point out both its strengths and its drawbacks. Even writing that, I can't say I'm completely surprised by all of the 5 star reviews, as there are a lot of things that this Chromebook gets right.\n\nThere are five key things worth highlighting here.\n\nFirst: the screen. Many of Acer's Chromebooks have, historically, been hampered by their poor displays. Thankfully, this time, Acer has gotten that part right. The Chromebook 14 has a 1080p IPS display with fantastic viewing angles and excellent brightness. I keep it at about 60-70% and it looks fantastic. It feels wonderful to finally say that about an Acer display.\n\nSecond: the build materials. Chromebooks have generally been budget-friendly devices, but recently we've started to see some that are either mid-range and high quality (like the Dell 13) or are upper-low end budget devices that still use more premium build materials, like the Asus C100P \"Flip\" and now, the Acer Chromebook 14. Note that I said build materials, and not build quality.\n\nThird: 4GB RAM, 32GB local storage. A more recent trend among Chrome OS devices is the inclusion of 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, instead of the 2GB/16GB to which we've become accustomed. For a lot of users, the local storage limitation isn't a big deal, as without applications, local storage isn't that critical... but it is nice for people who like to locally store music, photos, and movies, or who intent to install Crouton (or are looking ahead to the possibility of Android apps). The extra RAM, however, is great for everyone, as it makes this device more capable of running many tabs, or handling higher demand tasks like streaming content, without tabs crashing out or caching/reloading.\n\nFourth: Intel N3160 quad-core processor. This processor isn't exactly going to light the world on fire, but for most of what folks do with a Chromebook, it is going to be adequate, and it provides a user experience that feels significantly faster and more responsive than the N3050 on Windows 10 or Chrome OS, and is also more responsive in Chrome here than the x5-Z8300 is in Windows 10 (such as you'd see in the Intel Compute Stick or Asus E200HA).\n\nFifth: $299. When you stack up all these strengths and offer them at a price of $299, you're getting a fairly impressive value proposition here with this Chromebook. The screen is great, for both media consumption and general computing/web browsing; it offers a nice amount of local storage and solid performance via the Intel processor and 4GB of RAM, and it looks sharp, thanks to modern design queues and aluminum build materials.\n\nWhat's not to love here, right?\n\nWell........ I hate to be \"that\" guy, but there's a few things to pick at here.\n\nI keep reading comments along the lines of: \"Forget the Dell Chromebook 13 / Toshiba Chromebook 2 2015, this is the Chromebook to get!\" And for a lot of people, that's likely true, but I certainly won't say that's true as a blanket statement.\n\nLet's start with the Dell Chromebook 13. It has a smaller screen footprint, but is thicker and about the same weight, with a similar screen quality (and a tendency for backlight bleed); however, it packs a much more solid construction and a significantly more premium \"feel\" throughout, including its trackpad, keyboard, and overall feel in hand. It also has much better performance, including an easily upgraded M.2 SSD that has faster read/write speeds and much more flexibility for those looking to install Crouton (to use Linux). That last part is a small subset of users, but it is still worth noting; however, the performance and build quality gap are very real and will be notable to all users. And, of course, the Dell can be purchased with an even faster Intel Core i3 or i5, and can also be upgraded to a touchscreen, which again may be significant if Android apps come to Chrome OS.\n\nWhat about the Toshiba Chromebook 2 2015? Things are less clear here; the Toshiba again has better performance, and uses a real SSD, but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen, still the nicest of these three.\n\nI think that a lot of Toshiba customers should probably consider the Acer, but those who were aboard the Dell train for its build quality and performance will likely still want to move forward with that device instead of this one; if I had to choose between the two, I'd likely go Dell... but then again, budget isn't my number one concern. At $300, this is a great purchase...\n\n...which leads me to my next point, the omnipresent comments about \"This feels like a $1000 computer!\" or \"This is just like a MacBook Air for $300!\" The problem is that neither of those statements are close to accurate, and have to be chalked up to pure enthusiasm and excitement.\n\nFor instance, the $799 Dell XPS 13 feels remarkably better to use than this Acer does, as it has smaller bezels, a much nicer trackpad, a much better (backlit) keyboard, and far faster web browsing and general performance. And while the Acer does resemble a MacBook Air 13 from a distance, when you compare them in-hand, any talk of them being similar will disappear. The Acer is very nice, to be sure, especially considering the price or $299, but tapping the trackpad results in a hollow response compared to the MacBook's assured sturdiness, and the keyboard lacks the superb feel and response you find in a MacBook keyboard. The Acer may copy the MacBook's style, but it doesn't approach it's premium feel when you actually use it.\n\nThis isn't say the Acer is bad in the abstract; far from it. It has a nice, oversize trackpad that - like pretty much all Chromebooks - is responsive and a pleasure to use. And, its keyboard is comfortable if unremarkable. It also has pretty decent I/O with two USB 3.0 ports, HDMI, and also 802.11ac WiFi. It does unfortunately lack an SD or Micro-SD card slot, however.\n\nI can't help but feel that people are also slightly exaggerating the performance offered by the N3160. It is solid, and does a decent job rendering pages, and paired with the extra RAM here, it adequately handles streaming content in the background - such as YouTube or Spotify - and still maintains a decent browsing experience across eight to ten additional tabs; but realistically speaking, this Chromebook offers slower performance than the $199 Acer C720 from late 2013. Octane 2.0 benchmarks I ran in Guest mode scored around 8,000 to 8,200 which, again, is not horrible, but isn't much more impressive than budget devices using the Rockchip 3288 from last year (like the $149 Hisense Chromebook). I only mention this because, in my opinion, you're getting about $300 worth of performance here; anyone telling you this device runs like a $500 or $800 computer is exaggerating. My Dell i3 Chromebook is much faster at loading tabs in general, especially busy ones like CNN.com, as is my MacBook Air 2014. There's a very real performance gap here when compared to more expensive devices, but also when compared to Chromebooks running on the Intel 2955U or 3205U/3215U, which in the case of the latter Broadwell chips can churn out Octane scores nearly double what the Acer 14 offers.\n\nNone of this means the Acer Chromebook 14 is a bad Chromebook; on the contrary, it is an excellent Chromebook! I led with those first five points for a reason: being able to purchase a decently-performing Chromebook with aluminum build, a 1080p IPS display, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of local storage, and an Intel quad-core processor for $299 is basically what the entirely of the ChromeOS subreddit has been asking for over the past few years; as such I have to tip my had to Acer and commend them on building a very nice Chromebook for the consumer space, one which should do a great job converting people to the idea of Chrome OS.\n\nThat doesn't mean that I can't be disappointed in the lack of an SD card slot, the hollow feel and sound of the trackpad, the quite average keyboard, the feeling that the \"premium\" build quality is really just a nice \"coat of paint\" so to speak, the solidly average performance which is exceeded by devices 2.5 years old or matched by Chromebooks at half the price, the absence of a touchscreen upgrade, or the use of slower eMMC storage instead of a real M.2 SSD.\n\nThese are all valid points that probably make this more of a 4.5 star device than a true 5 stars. Worth buying? Heck yes! But perfect? Not so much.\n\nAnd please, everyone, stop saying this is a $300 Chromebook that is nicer and faster than a $1000 MacBook or PC, because if you've really used those devices, you know it isn't true... even if it sounds great in a review."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I have purchased four Chromebooks in as many years. I love the quick boot up, maintenance free operating system, but the poor choice in hardware was a bit irritating. Previous to the release of this Chromebook Chromebooks either suffered with a slow CPU (Samsung Chromebook and Toshiba Chromebook 2 First Edition), horrible screen quality (HP Chromebook and Samsung Chromebook), or a case so flimsy it would warp while handling (Toshiba Chromebook 2 First Edition). My previous computer was the Acer Chromebook 13 with a Tegra K1 processor and TN display. I liked the quality of build, but the processor was not that impressive, sometimes glitchy, and the display color washed out at the slightest angle.\nIt appears Acer is listening to the Voice of the Customer with the Chromebook 14. Ive been typing on this device for the last couple of days and using it to write this review. Honestly, this device seems to have a build quality way above the price point. Amazing, aluminum/sturdy housing much like a Macbook Air, and looks like one as well. A sharp (Full HD), well lit screen, with a decent brightness with great viewing angles due to the IPS screen. Sound is adequate, a responsive trackpad, and descent travel to the keys make this probably the first complete Chromebook at a $300 price point.\n\nI took the time to run a speed test (Jetstream 1.1) on three of my Chromebooks (higher score is better) and achieved the following results HP Chromebook 14 - Scored 74, Acer Chromebook 13 - Scored 45 and Acer Chromebook 14 - 46.7.\n\nI ran this same test on my Mac Mini Computer with an Intel I-7 processor and scored 146 for a comparison.\n\nI opened five tabs on the Chromebooks, streamed two videos from Youtube, while running (Jetstream 1.1) and achieved the following results HP Chromebook 14 - Scored 60 (-18.9%), Acer Chromebook 13-Scored 37.9 (-15.7%), and Acer Chromebook 14-Scored 44.5 (-4.7%).  Acer Chromebook 14 dropped the least amount due to the quad core processor.\n\nThere have been reviews referring to the slow processor, but this is a quad core processor.  I owned a Toshiba Chromebook 2 first edition and was frustrated with the lag of the processor.  To my surprise the octane score of the Toshiba Chromebook 2 first edition was similar to the performance of the Acer Chromebook 14.  I've been using this Acer Chromebook 14 for over a week and that frustrating lag does not exist.  This processor may not have a stellar octane score, but the quad core processor, and four gigs of ram, can handle anything a typical user can throw at it with very little lag."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "The new Acer Chromebook 14 feels like the beginning of a new generation for Chromebooks.  I have owned an HP Chromebook 14 for a couple of years now, so I'll be making comparisons to that device in this review.  I love my HP Chromebook, but there were two reasons it kept me from considering it as a 5-star worthy computer.  Screen resolution and fan noise.  The Acer Chromebook 14 fixes both of those by providing a 1080p IPS display and fanless design for complete silence.\n\nI set up both Chromebooks side by side and started with a screen quality comparison.  While my HP screen had a narrow \"sweet spot\" where the angle and position to the screen looked its best, the Acer looks good at any angle, and fantastic from a straight on viewpoint.  IPS technology is to thank for this.  Both devices appear to obtain similar maximum brightness output, while the Acer does offer more fine-tuning of the lower brightness spectrum.  I was pleased to find that the screen on the Acer Chromebook can open up greater than a 180 angle.  The HP didn't even come close.\n\nWhile using these Chromebooks in tandem I noticed that while changing the wallpaper on the new Acer it would also change it to match on the HP just next to it within a couple of seconds.  It was really cool to see how quickly the Google account updated in the cloud and copied settings over to other Chrome devices.  This made it very easy to compare the image quality as I perused many different images on each device.  The new IPS display on the Acer really does shine when compared to an inferior product.  The colors are much more natural and the clarity of the higher pixel count is easily apparent.\n\nMy next test was on the keyboards and touchpad.  Honestly, the keyboards and touchpads on each seem to be extremely similar.  It was hard to notice any real difference.  I loved the keyboard/touchpad combo on the HP, so I'm glad the Acer Chromebook 14 provides the same experience.  The Acer's touchpad does appear to be slightly larger, which is always nice.\n\nMy final comparison test involved the speakers.  The Acer has bottom mounted speakers just like my HP.  They're probably extremely similar in design, and they sound very similar as well.  I played identical YouTube videos on each one, pausing after every few lines to compare one after the other, and both sound good and get plenty loud at max volume.  I can't say one was an improvement over the other.  I believe the only way to improve the speaker design would be to implement a top-mount design, perhaps above the keyboard.\n\nMy only real complaint with Acer's new Chromebook 14 would be the power supply/cable.  The cable length is shorter than my HP's, so placement in certain situations where you need a charge could be an issue.  Thankfully the battery life is so good that if you charge it before you go anywhere you should make it through your day without needing to top it off.  The other thing to note is that Acer really skimped on the quality of the power supply cable.  It's twice as thin as the HP's and I'm worried about the durability of it.  I have dreadful visions of another company whose power cables are often much too thin and began to crack and fray.  Here's to hoping that is never an issue!\n\nIn the end this Chromebook fully deserves a 5-star rating.  You get a fast web-browsing device with a full HD display, great keyboard and touchpad combination, and amazing battery life that exceeds other Chromebooks that are in its price range.  It's hard to argue that it would benefit from anything else, except perhaps a backlit keyboard."}

See (How to Install Linux on a Chromebook and Unlock Its Full Potential on Lifehacker) If you are on the market for a 14 inch laptop, look no further...\n\nThis item was purchased, I did not receive any discount, promotion or free merchandise to review this item."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "I find this to be a fairly useless product. Freezes constantly. Can't seem to keep up with itself. Up and down keys are frequently locked or frozen so have to restart. Keyboard jumps while tying. Should have sent back"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "This is a alright laptop, did not really expect much. Just use it to watch videos and complete assignments. That's about to the extent that I use it."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "Everything about it is fine. But the keyboard stinks. The keys habe almost no travel so it is very easy for a key to not register."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "Nothing wrong with this Chromebook as I believe it is a great value.  My issue is with Chromebooks in general in that it's hard to get them to print wirelessly.  Even with cloud print capability from the printer.  Until Google fixes that I can't give a Chromebook five stars."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B01CVOLVPA", "review": "This chromebook is great if you have realistic expectations. This is good for watching movies and browsing the web. It uses Kodi. Its great for writing emails and writing small documents. This is NOT good for Wordpress, web design, working with long documents (even on google docs/sheets) or any sort of image editing whatsoever. The long battery life and low price is appealing but keep in mind, if you need a better processor, you are simply not going to find it at this price point.\n\nThat being said this chromebook is dope."}
