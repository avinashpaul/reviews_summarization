It doesn't stay charged long and the tablet and charger get hot easily. But we don't use it very often so it's okay. It keeps my son busy for short periods of time when we have to go somewhere and I know he'll be bored. The most awkward thing is he has to take the corner out of the case to plug in his headphones. And the pre-installed apps that you can't remove take up the majority of space so you can only add a few games/apps of your own. My son has about six or seven games. He can only get another when he deletes something. Which is also fine because he's not on it much."}

This is is not kid friendly as there is all the preinstalled apps and settings is easily accessible from the main screen. The screen is horrible to look at,, literally hurts our eyes.

I looked at lot of different  \"kids\" tablets before coming across the Orbo Jr and couldn't be happier!  Like other reviews have said, it's a full functional tablet dressed up like a kids device.  Right now I just needed it to run YouTube Kids and play some loaded videos.  I was able to reload the same apps he used on his sister's device in minutes and he picked it up running!  No tricks or hacks needed to get to the Google Play store.  As he gets older we'll start adding learning apps just for him.  It's a bit slower than the ipad mini (as expected) but very easy to use,  you can download apps from the Google Play store with no problem (comes preloaded) and it's the perfect size for little hands."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "This product was not up to my satisfaction. I returned it. First we had trouble connecting to Netflix which was the main reason my child got the tablet. It would give us an error message 95% of the time saying it was unable to connect to Netflix at this time try again later. Then on day 1 we noticed the battery life was rediculous. My child was able to watch one-two shows and it would go from 100% down to 36%. Day 2 we uploaded educational apps for him to see maybe the Netflix glitch was temporary (which it wasn't) while he was playing on a app, the battery dropped from 100% down to 69% in 10 minutes. We had the tablet two days and returned it on the third. I had read the reviews but figured let's try it out since some electronics do have defects maybe these customers just got a defected item. I saw quite a few positive reviews so I went against my gut instinct. I learned my lesson and wouldn't reccomned this tablet. We are purchasing a slightly more expensive one by Samsung."}

I had anticipated a tablet that would withstand the trials of being handled by a toddler, yet had the functionality necessary to keep the boy occupied for a few minutes here and there so I could get work done around the house. Instead, what I have is a tablet that is slow to boot up, slow to load the applications, and constantly crashes so my son is incessantly seeking my attention for the thing. To make it worse, I cannot get it to factory reset so I can attempt to solve the problems.\n\nThis was, without a doubt, the worst $50 I could have spent on something for my child. I would love to recoup my loss, but I cannot in good conscience sell this to anyone else."}

We thought that these tablets would be great for them but they didn't meet 5 year old standards and certainly not tech critic standards like mine. The back light bleed is unbearable in this tablet. The LED back light bleeds out so much, it makes black look like grey. Speaking of black, lets talk about color accuracy, everything is cold. Even if the picture/video you are viewing is the warmest photo ever, this tablet will make it look colder than the winter in Alaska. I was playing fruit ninja to test it out. The game's background, a brown wall, for starting levels is very warm on my iPad Air. However, on the Orbo Jr. the picture was so cold that it made me shiver while playing. The tablet is very unresponsive. I pressed the game ABC's for Kids once, expecting it to immediately open the app I was surprised when the app didn't open for ten seconds. When it finally did open I was hit with \"ABC's for Kids is not responding. Would you like to close the app?\" Terrible. This product has one great feature however. It charges quickly. That's it. DO NOT by any means spend your hard earned dollars on this failure of a tablet.\nThank You"}

We even bought a SIM card to expand the storage, but after downloading 2 games (and not big games) to the device, it was completely full.  We even moved the games to the storage card and because the game needed space on the device to merely run, it wouldn't work.  No matter what we did to erase unused programs (and there were a\nTON of them) it locked up and refused to play anything due to no storage space on the device.  There was literally no work around.  There are thumb drives that have more storage space than this piece of junk.  Strongly suggest no buying this device... you will just be paying an additional $12 in return shipping."}

We ended up returning them because our daughter was not using hers like we thought she would, and our son's was the one with the battery issues.  Overall, I'd likely purchase these again because they were a good unit for the money.  Just ended up not being what we thought our kids would use.  (Kids are 6 years old)."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "I aim to write positive reviews only - however, I have to be completely honest with this product. Despite reading multiple negative reviews prior to purchasing this (actually bought 3 of them in different colors for our children), I figured I'd give the product the \"benefit of the doubt\" as I feel all too often people tend to be negative in general. Price wise it was fantastic. We purchased these as Christmas gifts for our three children. Aged 11, 7, & 2. Mind you these tablets are heavily advertised as small children's tablets. They come with vibrantly colored, very nice rubber covers or \"cases\" which are the only thing we really liked about them. Within three days of opening these tablets we were extremely displeased with their performance. We charged product as directed - yet, after only an hour or so of use and even though there were multiple periods of inactivity the battery drained completely to the point of turning off. Two, out of the three chargers we received broke within the first two days of use. I mean the insert basically just fell off while trying to plug it into device. The screens are blurry and hard to read and view with use. The device runs extremely slow if using more than one application or program (games, etc). Downloading games are a chore and seemingly take forever. So, as I mentioned before the product is said to be perfect for smaller children. We were utterly shocked and completely displeased when we were driving, our child dropped, not threw, but dropped his tablet by mistake on the car floor; with a rubber mat no less --- and the screen cracked. It completely cracked! This was day three of use. Our children are well behaved with the usage of tablets. We have a family Nexus and they use it constantly without any damage or concern even with the few times it has accidentally been dropped - between the five of us, it works well and has never become damaged. We simply wanted our kids' to each have his/her own while road tripping, etc. Needless to say, we chose to return all of the tablets for a refund. The concept is great. The product not so great.\nSkip it! Better off investing in the 'real deal' --- terrible quality and performance."}

I purchased this for my son for a trip on a long plane ride and I love that I can download any app that a regular android product could have access to. I is practically an android tablet. I added a 16GB memory card for holding more apps for my son so I love that you can have that. the volume works great so you can make it go decently loud if your wanting to listen to music. I never put any card information on this so there will never be any accidental charges. I love the silicone case as far as it getting dropped but I hate how it collects every piece of dirt or hair it touches. I would recommend purchasing a screen protector so if it gets dropped that is there to protect it. The battery life is not the greatest but It did last me a day of traveling. I of course had the charger with me and charged it between layovers, I would recommend buying a fast charging usb plug so you can fast charge it if needed (best purchase ive ever made is that fast charging cord). When I purchased this I was a little concerned due to other reviews but I figured its worth the shot since its for a child. I would happily purchase this for any future children I may have."}

This is horrible that this happened on Christmas. I gave it two stars because the return process was easy. Now we're awaiting the iRulu tablet. I will not recommend this tablet.

So out of the box you have to spend the time formatting the tablet for kid safety.  None of the \"Numerous Apps Preinstalled\" were installed.  Should have clued in on the poor use of grammar with \"Preinstalled\".\n\nRubber protective sleeve has a horrible chemical smell that lingers in whatever room the tablet is in.\n\nPros:\nCheap and works.\n\nTips:\nRemove the rubber protective sleeve, reseal it in the amazon box, and handily walk it out to the curb trash can.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "While this tablet comes with a silicone protective case, is attractive and thin, and fully equipped to access the play store and download apps, it has many downfalls.\n1) The charging cord is very poorly made. My child's broke the first time she used it and the 2nd child's fell apart within a month.\n2) The battery life is a joke. Seriously. On a good day, it lasted 3 hours or so. It spent more time being charged than being used. Even while not being used, the battery drains faster than it should. For example, if it were fully charged at night and we left it off the charger, it'd be dead in the morning.\n3) The screen isn't bright. The material that makes up the screen is probably shatter proof (good) but not scratch resistant. My 4 year old's case is so scratched up that it affects the viewing. We have had it since September and it's not even Christmas yet.\n4) THEY DON'T LAST. It's dead. Won't charge anymore.\n5) While it did last, it froze. A lot. Hulu app won't open despite several restarts and reinstalls on one of my Orbo Jrs.\n6) It's only 4GB. And, adding a micro SD card will do NOTHING. It isn't designed to allow you to install apps on an external SD card. I even researched it and tried hacking it, but the system wasn't compatible. This thing fills up ridiculously fast because most of the space is already filled up with the operating system."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "I bought 3 of these for my first grade classroom, mostly because the looked durable and child-friendly, and the price was ok.  The tablets are simply terrible. My students frequently have issues with using apps.  When they close out of an app, it visually goes away, but the music and noise does not shut off.  I have to either turn the entire tablet off and on again or go into settings and fiddle around for a while until I figure out how to end the app.  My students are constantly coming and interrupting my small groups because they are unable to switch between apps.\n\nThe rubber case around it is really thick, which I thought would be a good thing for small hands, but the holes for the headphones are so narrow that unless you have a very thin headphone plug, you can't actually plug in headphones.  If you have a thin enough one, like for most earbuds you can plug it in if you push hard enough to squeeze through the thick rubber.  Most of my students  are not strong/coordinated enough for this.  However one of my first-graders, after having observed me successfully 'push hard' to get one on, decided to try herself with headphones that had a wider plastic bit, and now I have a snapped off headphone piece inside my headphone jack.  (My students plug headphones in successfully to the computers in the computer lab and in the classroom and have never in 9 years of teaching had a problem, so I know it is due to the  poorly-made case, and not because my students are unable to handle headphones properly.)\n\nOne of the three  tablets I bought came with a charger that had a loose connection, and would not actually charge the tablet half the time.  It took weeks of trying to figure out 'who wasn't plugging in the tablets' before I realized it was actually the charger, not the students.  I bought a new one for $6, so that was an easy fix.  However one of the other cases had a problem where the hole through the rubber was not big enough to accommodate the charger that came with it.  I have since hacked larger holes into all of the cases with an exacto knife.  So now my cases are ugly but functional.  This has been more of a headache than anything else in the classroom though.  A very, very expensive mistake."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "The people posting five star reviews after owning this for a week should be ashamed.  This is a 2-3 star product at best.\n\nAdvertised at 199 and then an absurd percentage \"off\" is misleading. It is a $60 tablet selling for $55-60. I got a lightning deal last thanksgiving and at $47 i wish i had returned it. But i kept running into issues with the cord not plugging in all the way so it wouldnt charge and it has sat forgotten for multiple stretches of weeks.  Finally figured out you need to peel the cover back to get a good connection, which means the cover should have had a slightly bigger hole.  It takes about 6-8 hours to charge and lasts about 2-3 hours, way less if you have wifi on. So if downloading something, plug it in first. And don't download two things at once, or try and play and download at the same time. It says dual core but my guess is it is sporting some old processor and a cheap battery.\n\nIf you have the patience for downloading slowly and one at a time, and want to limit tablet time to a few hours, and need an inexpensive tablet with a very sturdy rubber case, this is not a bad deal. So it gets 2-3 stars. But anyone giving it more than that is stretching the truth. Or have kids breaking their $100-200 tablets...\n\nA perfect example, charged overnight, son played it this morning while trying to update two apps and download two games, so with wireless on battery was at 9%. After having to redownload one and find the other after a frustrating search to figure out where it downloaded to but didn't install. Charging for an hour now, its at 17% and that is with wireless off..."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "First and foremost, ignore the crossed out $199 price tag that Amazon is for some reason letting these crooks display on their website.  This tablet has never and will never be a $200 quality tablet.\n\nYou basically get what you pay for here, which is a $60 tablet that functions like you would expect from a $60 tablet...  And that's not good.  Especially when these are clearly advertised for you to buy for your child.  If your child is under the age of say 3, this might be an appropriate first tablet.  Children older than 3, or ones smart enough to know a piece of junk when they see it, will likely just hate you for being so cheap.\n\nThe battery life is abysmal.  If your child gets 2-3 hours of play before it dies, they will be lucky.  Similarly, the amount of time the battery takes to charge just as terrible, if not worse.\n\nIt has virtually no storage space, so you'll spend most of your time trying to convince your child that they have to erase games they have no interest in erasing.  And chances are once you get something new installed, it's going to run so slow that it's virtually unplayable.\n\nThe only reason I gave it a second star is because it hasn't entirely died as of yet, and because miraculously it's reasonably sturdy when it comes to being dropped/abused in ways that most young children handle their toys.\n\nSo again, you're basically getting exactly what you pay for.  A cheap tablet at a cheap price.  If you are generally trying to buy something for a child you actually care about, spend another $40 and get them a legitimate tablet.  These people posting 4/5 star reviews must really dislike their kids."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "Bought these off a different website, but it wasn't me who insisted on getting these. As soon as I read TFT I said \"NO WAY!\" but my SO is clueless when it comes to buying things like this and likes to spend money on cheap crap and insisted on these because they were \"just for the kids\" instead of saving up for better ones which I wanted to do (I work in IT so I know stuff about this kind of stuff).\n\nFirst off, when you pull these out of the box you might notice that some of the \"packaging\" is missing. These are most likely refurbished or made in a factory in China.\n\nMine had Japanese apps on them for \"some reason\". I disabled some of the apps that keep an eye on cleaning it and battery life etc which seemed to speed things up quite a bit, but definitely didn't extend battery life. Some useless apps come with this thing. Uninstalled everything I could because they have an app on it I can't get rid of that takes care of some other apps that are preinstalled and I don't want, nor do the kids need.\n\nThe screen is absolute garbage. If you turn it vertical you get that \"can't view from an angle\" effect from the TFT screen which the older LCD monitors used to use before LED was used. It gave me a headache and I couldn't look at it for more than about 10 minutes or even less.\n\nThese came with android OS 4.1, updated to 4.2 when I got it and even though 4.4 is available now, will not recognize that there is an update in the OS even though I checked it again yesterday.\n\nThe cables and chargers that came with them went straight to the garbage and I used my phone charger instead since these use micro USB cables. The cables and chargers are of the worst quality and not even worth your time. They take no less than 8hrs to charge and even then they might not be fully charged and will definitely damage the cheap battery used in these things. The phone charger takes about 2hrs or less to charge them fully and they do not last longer than 2-3hrs at BEST. I just finished replacing the digitizer (the screen on top of the monitor to detect touch input) yesterday, and after the tablet was fully charged for the 3rd or even 4th time today already, it literally JUST died in less than an hour, from my daughter playing a game, as I was writing this so I think it might be dead now so that was probably a waste spending another ~$40 on the digitizer.\n\nThe cases these are in are really flimsy (not the silicone cover). One of them was left on the couch, sat on and cracked the screen which is why I just finished replacing the digitizer. It wasn't jumped on either and they are not *that* heavy (approximately 80lb child). A quality tablet would not have cracked under minimal stress like that.\n\nOn top of the garbage I mentioned above, I also bought 2, 16GB micro SD cards for these and just noticed today that one of the tablets isn't reading one of them. I still have to do some testing to see if it's either the tablet or the card, but I'm willing to put money on the tablet being at fault.\n\nOverall I give these 0 stars, but not possible on Amazon so I have to settle giving them a rating at all. Extremely disappointed and a definite BUYER BEWARE!\n\nOne last note, A4C is the website I bought mine from. I made a similar review on their website but they didn't post it. After doing some digging, they don't seem to allow anything less than 3 stars with a half decent review in their favor in order to boost sales it seems."}

I wish I just spent the extra $0.54 - $40 and got the older version of the Kindle Fire for my son.\n\nMy family has 2 Kindles, one for me and one for my husband.

I have tried on multiple occasions on different days and I have not been able to get this tablet to handle playing a song from Amazon music to date.  It immediately gives me a warning about the tablet overheating EVERY time an app is opened.  Please note this is when ONE SINGLE app is opened.  Not when multiple apps are opened.  This happens with Skype, ABCMouse.com, even when I open the alarm clock app to set up an alarm!!!  This is a huge con and I am knocking down 3 stars for this.\n- Toddlers (4 yr old) can not easily charge the tablet with the case on the tablet.  The case makes it so you have to wiggle the USB charger into the case.\n- Little Battery Life.  This thing will only last about 45 mins before it has to be charged.\n\nOF NOTE:\nA USB cord and wall adapter charger is included.  But, chargers are included with all tablets.  I am leaving 2 stars on this product since it is still useable for about 45 mins.  This is annoying on trips.  I suppose it could be a good thing when we are at home because the tablet limits my son's screen time for me.\n\nThank you for reading.  I hope this review was helpful for you."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "I've now had this product for 8 months roughly, of which I've now had plenty of time to get to know the product and write an accurate review. My first orbo tablet I bought for my daughter was a defect, as the connection from the charger to the tablet literally smoked when it was plugged in, causing the tablet to no longer work (it was brand new and not used yet). I returned it to amazon and was issued a new tablet. Interestingly enough, this orbo jr had a different charger. I have had nothing but problems with it since. The connection gets very lose over time and eventually stops working. Thus causing you to be unable to charge the tablet and use it. I've bought several chargers since, still same issue. It is not a well made product. I personally would have saved my money and bought something else had I known I'd have these issues. The case is frustrating b/c we'd have to take it off everytime to plug it in b/c the hole they created didn't fit the charger properly to actually stay in. This was the case with both orbo jr's I had.\nAs far as the product itself being something your child will like, my daughter absolutely loved it. Obviously you can't download much on it, but she loved being able to use netflix and play games on it. It's user friendly and pretty intuitive with figuring out how to use. It would be nice if they had a lot less of the preloaded apps on it that your child won't use. It takes up a lot of space which is a downside. The quality of the picture isn't bad, good enough for a kid to be happy. It's a shame it's not a better made product, but - you get what you pay for now a days I guess. Even spending $60, you can't seem to have a product that lasts longer than a year. I can't get the charger connection into the tablet to work anymore, so unfortunately I have to now look at buying a new tablet - this time it will be a different tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "The tablet is a nice little replacement for my son's old one that died. So far I have been impressed with new tablet features that include a \"cool down\" mode and an indicator when it is getting to warm. This is a very nice component since the thick bumper can lead to overheating (happened to a phone I owned too). My son is 10 and can watch for the indicator, but I could see younger children being able to use it as it turns red when hot and is a standard blue when normal. The tablet has a battery indicator in the menu also that uses the same color scheme (blue when good and red when low), so kids don't have a lot to remember on the warning lights. Good memory, pretty standard for tablets. Battery life is pretty good, at least 4 hours and more typically 7-8. The tablet can even optimize the battery (adult required) so it gets extended life and you can check how many \"hours\" are left which makes deciding whether or not to charge easy. We like this offering and would purchase again."}

Something with the rooting of the program went wrong to where the virus protection that I out on there thought that the google app was a virus that needed to be deleted. There are programs that are rooted permantly that otherwise would be able to delete on any other Android tablet. The battery runs down after 30 minutes.

When we got up the next morning we went to turn it on and all we got was the red/white \"ORBO\" title screen, that flashed on and off. I looked at the poor excuse for a manual to see what it suggested and it said to charge for 10 minutes and then hold the power button down to do a reset on the device. No change. I understand it's not a high end device and shouldn't expect too much but I thought we'd get more use than two days out of it!  Not only am I disappointed but the kids are sad that I'm taking the tablet away from them!  Way to go ORBO!  Then I thought I would just exchange it for a new one and that wasn't even an option!  Refund only...guess I learned if it sounds too good to be true it probably is..."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "So I only spent an HOUR with this tablet, and I wish I had that hour back. I read all the negative reviews but there were just as many if not more that were glowing. First I will give the positives. The rubber bumper is nice, thick and durable, and its the best thing about this item. These rest however is pure junk. I got the BLUE March 2014 version but I would not trust any version of this substandard product. The software is like a tracfone phone build running android and there are a lot of apps like skype, hangouts, dialer, data usage, maps etc that are not appropriate for a tablet (I doubt this thing could even run skype). I turned this on with 100% battery and it said 10hours of battery life, I turned it off after an hour of light use (never got anything to actually run) and it had less than 50% battery. What a JOKE. I got a CPU high temp warning within the first 15 minutes of BASIC operations. The screen resolution is horrid, ALL glare, you cannot view at ANY angle but straight on. It looks like there is a thick slab of plastic over the screen which is recessed farther back. I never got chrome or google play store to actually open before or after the updates. However their MOBI brand store opened fine (think tracfone graphics) and their substandard browser opened fine. From there it was a buggy, laggy, slow spinning circle nightmare. I was finally able to download plants vs zombies from the mobi app store but it never opened just error messages and ads for other things.  I had a $15 virgin mobile phone running android that I gave my young son for just apps/games that worked better than this \"tablet\". There are good tablets in the $50-75 range from reputable brands that function/look like an ipad compared to this. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. I am just glad that I got this out to look at before I gave to my son who would have been extremely disappointed and frustrated. I got this at a discount (free would have been too much) for an HONEST opinion."}

Everything else is up to date, it comes with Netflix, and Skype downloaded on it, and it is Android operated so you can download anything you want from the play store on it! The only complaint I have is the the one I received has a mark on the screen where it appears somebody pushed it a little to hard, and it needs a screen protector for sure, other than that, I now have a really cool tablet (my first one) and when my son gets older he can use it too! If anything may arrise, I will update my review, however as far as right now I am more than satisfied with my new orbo jr tablet."}

I thought I was getting a tablet that was going to be just equipped with kids games. What I got was a tablet for any person in the family. You use google play store and you can download any app available. I loved that this tablet works for all ages and it a reasonable price. We got it for our daughter and she loves it. She can play games and watch videos on it as well. The case for the tablet is amazing too. Within a hour of playing with it, my daughter already dropped the tablet. Well, you would even realize she did. it just bounced off the floor. Nothing else happened. The case really protected it , Which makes it even better for kids. If you are looking for something to buy you child a tablet but don't want to spend the 100's of dollars for the tablets that are out there i would highly recommend buying this. It really is a good tablet and is protects by a great case."}

Plenty of space on it already, but I was able to pop a micro SD card from an old phone in it, so now it holds a TON. We have plenty of videos and pictures on it, so this is a restaurant must.

This was one of my favorite thing's about it.. it actually gave it the kid look so it wasn't just a \"tablet\"\n**The individual colors. Makes it easy to tell the difference if you have more than one tablet.\n\nCons-\n**The batter life really does stink. I understand when apps are running they will drain the battery quick.. but I feel like this one is always dying.\n**The flimsiness. Every time I pick it up it cracks and creeks, the tablet is poorly manufactured, meaning it won't last long, especially with kids.\n**You have to remove the silicone case to charge it.\n**Runs awfully slow, but my kids didn't pay it no mind.\n\nHonestly... you're better off spending another $30-$40 to get something that will last longer than a few weeks, if it even lasts that long.\nI do want you to know that it did come fully functional though, It does everything it's supposed to do and it keeps the kids occupied."}

No big deal......, except it just kept doing that over, and over, and over, and over......turning it off and back on has zero effect. We let the battery drain completely and recharged it. Now, it is stuck on the android screen and won't load any farther. My child is very upset and wants her tablet, and I am upset that I spent money on a product that only lasted three days!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "The case seems nice and durable, but this tablet is so incredibly slow that it has trouble running the built-in web browser and Netflix app.  The screen has a pretty narrow viewing angle, which isn't always a bad thing, but if the tablet is targeted toward youngsters and it is incapable of running basic applications - let alone games - then it is really a tablet that satisfies no target audience.  I cannot stress this enough - this tablet works worse than a mid-range smartphone from several years ago.  Avoid the headaches and the frustration - avoid this product at all costs."}

After that, it worked great, and the sound is great. The battery was going down fast, but that is going to happen the first time you use it. After you fully charge it later, it should stay full for longer. It is small, and it is very thin.

My three year old played on it maybe 2x a months for less than 25 minutes each time.  I tried to download my Square App thinking I might take it to a trade show with me at the end of May.  The device jammed while downloading and would only go to a \"default\" screen.  I let the tablet battery sit completely dead for a little more than a week hoping to reset the device.  After that I fully recharged the battery but was unable to get the tablet to even boot up.  When I contacted Seller1ON1 for assistance with this issue they would not help in any way.  I was even asking for suggestions on how to get the device to boot up.  Seller1ON1 would simply refer me to Amazon's 30 day return policy due to that fact that \"Amazon shipped it\".  I will be watching to make sure I do not purchase anything else from Seller1On1, not a company I am comfortable doing business with."}

And i like that it doesnt just play kid games. He can watch netflix and other things.\nThe bad- Even on a full charge it lasts about 45 mins to an hour before dying. The camera is very poor quality. And even when commected to wifi with great signal strength it runs very slowly. It's definately not for games like hillclimb racing or Turbo Fast. It lags very badly.\nSomething to keep in mind is that it also doesnt have the sensors which tell position. So you cant play games by motion of the tablet.\n\nAs far as price goes, you get what you pay for. If you're looking for something for your kid to play a few games on, maybe watch a movie, and not spend $800 like some other tablets, this does the job. But, i wish we would've spent a little more for a better one."}

The first couple weeks it worked alright. A bit slow but wasn't a big concern sense it was for a toddler, he didn't need the top of the line tablets. Well it only got worse from there. It started to freeze and run a bit slower. There wasn't much on the tablet aside from about 5 apps so there was no reason for it to be so sluggish. I made sure to clear data on the apps to help it run better, but that did not work. I would not purchase this again even for a toddler. The screen is also a very low quality, some what strains the eyes. Even with only 5 apps the storage was almost full.\n The frustration in trying to get the tablet to run or not force close every little kid app was bad. Next time we will spend a bit more to get something that will work longer then a couple of weeks."}

It's fine to play a few simple games, but you can't install firmware to keep your kid from exiting the game (hitting the back button) and that was the buzz killer for us - she can't play games on it because she touches the screen and it constantly exits the game - so she just watches films on it when we go to restaurants.

Some Ideas\n\nJuke box - make a juke box and place this in for the interface control. theres free software to do this or you can use pandora\n\nDoor bell. - you could easily use this for interaction at your door with an arduino tie in application since this has a camera on front and back\n\nHome automation interface - use this on a wall to make in a control hub for your automated home.\n\nSecurity - since this has a camera, audio, and wifi in one package you could easily just use it for streaming your home to your phone through vox or some other type of app.\n\nJust for the price alone I would use this instead  of other home automation products out there......it doesn't have to be a kids tablet"}

The battery does Not last long. if you're looking for something that you can take on long trips, traveling, to baby sitter's etc - this is not for you. After fully charging he only gets a few hours of use before it completely dies. For the price I paid, I can't complain too much (if we figure out how to use it properly) - but I wouldnt buy this again if given the option. You get what you pay for & clearly I should have spent the extra money to get a better quality tablet."}

It's a bit slower than I prefer, but is just fine for a kid. The internal space is just not worth it though. Other than the apps it came with, after downloading Netflix and 4 games, it says it's out of storage space. I'm hoping I can buy him an sd card for this tablet and solve this problem. For the money, just spend an extra $25. And get a kindle fire. The cheapest one is 6\" display with 8g of internal space. I have the kindle fire hdx and I LOVE it. My grandmother just bought the kindle 6\"/8g, and it is really about the same. A great tablet."}

Includes a cheap charger with a short wire, that nevertheless works and can easily be replaced with a better one. Works perfectly. Screen appearance is not the absolute brightest, but it's clear. I loaded his favorite game and educational apps (free) and deleted what he doesn't need (i.e. FaceBook). Can't beat the price. Just buy it.\n\nIf you're trying to decide between this and a LeapFrog, as I was; the difference is that LeapFrog will ultimately cost you a heck of a lot more than just the cost of the tablet because their apps are not free and cost an average of $7.99-$35 (see http://www.leapfrog.com/en-us/app-center/c)."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "We purchased this as an Amazon daily deal and it seemed like a good idea: $45 for a kid's tablet. I didn't really expect much, but I wanted to give my kindergartener a tablet of \"his own\" to play a few apps and do his Reading Eggs. Really, at that price point, I didn't expect a great resolution screen and super fast processing - just something basic and resilient that my little boy could have for himself. (Because we are not the 'I'm going to buy my kindergartener an Ipad kind of family'.)\n\nSo, we received it and opened it up. Instructions are pretty minimal. We got it all charged up and my husband tried to add some apps. Amazon apps seemed to work ok at first, but then would crash when it started to download. My husband had to resort to using the Orbo proprietary app store if he wanted to download something. This was definitely a negative as we didn't want to add another place to purchase apps besides Google Play and the Amazon App Store (especially since we had purchased full copies from these aforementioned e-stores.)\n\nSo, he managed to get two of the free versions of Angry BIrds apps from THEIR store. And then it was full. Seriously, two apps put it at 99% memory full. Really?!\n\nWe let our son play for a few minutes, then it was dinner time and he put it away. The next day, I decided to reward him and let him play for a little while. He picked it up and told me it wouldn't turn on. What? Okay, maybe he never powered it off and the juice ran out. I plugged it in and got it charged. When I noticed that the battery was full later that evening, I unplugged it. The next day, I handed it to him and told him that I charged it and that he could play with it now. He took it to the family room and played for a little while. A very little while. Around 10 minutes, maybe less? And came in and told me that it turned off. I took a look at it, tried to turn it on and then plugged it in AGAIN. Yes, the battery was dead after a few minutes of use. That was the last straw and I returned it to Amazon. Fortunately, they are easy to work with.\n\nOnce again, I didn't have high expectations, but I did expect it to have a battery that could take a few hours of use and enough space to add more than two apps. What we received was JUNK and ended up with a very disappointed little boy."}

I went to put a new screen saver on it, which I have done many times to other devices, and the screen cracked!  This screen is not made well at all, its definately not for a child.  You cannot put any pressure on it at all!  I am returning for a refund."}

The screen still turns on but you can't use it because the touch screen part is broken.  I would have thought since it is a kids tablet and it comes with a silicone cover it would have held up a little better then that.  I got it for his birthday and he didn't even have it a whole month.  I would not recommend."}

Company paid for return shipping although replacement took over a week to get here.  Now if I pay for Prime and get 2 day shipping;  why didn't it come 2 day the second time?  New model Orbo even came upgraded. Looks and has a completely different feel to it.  As a tablet for a 7 year old, it is very nice for the price.  Get the warranty though for your own peace of mind for under $15.  Might give it 5 stars had it arrived the first time like this.  Something needs to be addressed. Update 11/15. Glass has cracked. Unit dead. Worst feature;  you might get 2 hours off battery. Horrible battery."}

These were purchased with the intention that they would only be playing games on and not using other apps.\n\nThis is a decent tablet for kids.  Yes, the battery doesn't last long, but a little kid shouldn't be glued to electronics all day, so charging the battery forces them to take a break.  I purchased three of these from the same seller (seems like the only seller of these on amazon), one red, one blue, one pink.  These aren't the highest quality tablets, and don't have a whole lot of memory, but a memory card is cheap and the quality is fine for a kid.  Screen is good and tablet starts up faster than my Nexus 7 does.  I actually had to return the blue tablet because I couldn't connect with Google Play and the screen wasn't as responsive as the other two colors I'd purchased with it.  Seller was quick to give a full refund after I returned it. I didn't have the option of ordering a replacement instead just returning, which was a bummer since I had to order the second blue one for more money.  The second blue sometimes has a hard time turning on (i.e you have to hold the power button down for 5-10 second until the \"Orbo\" screen comes on). The pink and red tablets have no problems turning on.\n\nIf it weren't for the difficulties with the blue tablet(s), I'd give FOUR Stars."}

It's 50 something dollars and the Nabi is 100 and something dollars. So, you get a small, small,small fraction of the NABI. Honestly I did not purchase this item expecting it to be just as efficient, but because I wanted my child to get use to the idea of having a tablet before I purchase the \"real thing.\" My son is only 4 and a little rambunctious. I am actually surprised that Android allowed a company use their name to produce such as inferior product. Other buyer mentioned that the ORBO  does not keep a charge. I've experienced the same thing, and it takes several of hours (9-12 hrs.)  to fully charge (more hours to charge than play time). Most of all, the camera absolutely sucks and the picture is terrible. The picture is actually like staring a negatives. I think that too people purchased this product expecting it to perform just as well as other products; if this you, you will be very unhappy with this product. Anyone saying that this product is great, is just flat out lying!!!! You literally get what you've paid for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}

My main complaint about it is that all the free toddler apps have so many ads in them it is very hard for a toddler to even play them.  The ads are all over the games so that it is too easy to hit an ad and it will close the game and take you to a different screen to try to get you to buy it.  Very frustrating for a toddler just trying to play a game.  Also, you have to take the rubber case off of it every time you plug it in because the plug won't fit with the cover on."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "We bough this for my granddaughter as a Christmas gift - she likes it.  However we have a few concerns.  1. The parental control/usability/restrictions are NOT easy to do, or even to figure out. There are so many pre-loaded apps or software programs with no real explanation of what they are or what they do. Our daughter (who is very technically skilled on devices like this) has been going through it as she can, but as a general rule, it would be better if the company provided parental control options in an easier format. Especially since they're targeting the device for children.\n2. The battery life is short, about 30 minutes. If they forget to plug-it-in at the end of a play session it is useless the next time she picks it up.\n3. The usability isn't great. Maybe because her parents are coming from something so friendly (a Mac/Apple environment) - the learning process is a bit awkward.\n\nThere aren't really any how-tos out there on the web either. No You-Tube videos, or tutorials. IT's kinda weird!\n\nEven though she likes it, a lot, our granddaughter just doesn't use it a-lot (electronic devices in general) I'm glad it wasn't expensive, her parents would feel guilty! :)"}

For a table that has geared itself towards children, it is terrible. The charger fits loosely into the tablet and seems flimsy and easy to break. I bought 3, and one of them is already having an issue connecting to the charger cable to where it plugs into the tablet (after only 6 days of use). It is SLOW, doesn't have much memory, and it has issues running many of the larger games out there like Deer Hunt 2014. I have had to install/uninstall many apps in the hopes of getting them to work without freezing the tablet or the app shutting itself down. The battery doesn't last long. We have so many issues getting them to play games that my kids have set them aside and ask to play on my iPad. Unfortunately, they wrote their names on the rubber cover making returning them difficult - if I could return them I would."}

It doesn't have a great battery life, but that helps us with limiting his time on it anyway.

If we do, I'll come back and update my review.\n\nUpdated 4/29/2015 - We've had this for about 5 months now, and it's overheated a few times. It freezes up and even has trouble running some apps I would deem basic. The biggest problem we've had though is that when starting it up, it takes FOREVER to load and goes through a bunch of \"updates\" every single time, even if it was just restarted not long before. 3 year olds aren't patient... he's learning to be more patient because of this, so I guess that's a bonus? Oh and the battery? Say I charge it Saturday with the intention of giving it to him the next day, but I forget until Monday... it's dead. From sitting and doing nothing."}

I had to reason with my children to let the battery charge for 6-8 hrs. so that they can have a chance of enjoying it. As soon as I placed the tablets on the charger, it looked as if the battery was draining more than charging. 4 (yes I said 4) hours later, an empty battery image with an triangle popped up and it started making these weird static/popping noises. I unplugged all three tablets and tried to look online for troubleshooting tips in which there were NONE!!! Unfortunately since I ordered these tablets back in September (I do all Christmas shopping early) I cannot return these faulty, false-advertising pieces of trash that I wasted $180.00. This is what I get for being cheap, and not getting the Samsung Galaxy S3 tablet I wanted to get for my little ones.

This was purchased for my 22 month old, who loves to listen to The Wheels on the bus video's etc. He has navigated our IPAD mini with ease since the age of 18 months, and we thought this would be great for him, and would free up our IPAD. Being that he was so little, I was glad to see that there was a \"protective\" case already included on this tablet, as he has both dropped and thrown our IPAD in the past, in which there was absolutely no damage done at all. However, upon setting this tablet up, I was disappointed in the protective case, it is a flimsy silicone that can be removed, and there is no screen protection at all. In my opinion it does not provide adequate protection for a \"toddler JR tablet\". After just 2 days, the screen is cracked, and I am not sure how it happened exactly, as he was using it sitting down on the sofa at the time, and no one heard him drop or throw it. I was considering returning the item due to very poor battery life, as it would die after just 2 hours of use, however now I am even more disappointed in the weakness of the product.

It didn't matter if I tried the existing or new account it kept opening a screen that said Google Play Store unfortunately has stopped and never let me log in either way.  Then I got a pop up window that said the Google Play Store is not supported on this device!! What??? The icon is there but I am not allowed to use it?? Seriously? ? When I would use the game store it came with it wouldn't allow me to download anything. It said this device is set to Block certain apps. So after I figured out how to clear that up I was finally able to download the game. However we couldn't hear It. The sound doesn't work. When we wanted to do something by touching the screen it wouldn't work.  It kept freezing or the touch screen is just terrible.  I was very let down considering everything it is said to have.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "The screen has poor resolution, colors, and viewing angle. The sound was barely audible. The processor and memory provide poor performance. But I expected all of those deficiencies given the price, and would have been satisfied with the product for my intended purpose of a media viewer for Netflix and YouTube. However, the tablet crashed every time I tried to load Google Play Store, which rendered it useless in my mind. I returned it and am trying the Chromo now, which is similarly priced and featured, but actually seems to work so far.\n\nOn the plus side, the case is nice. It has a soft feel and seems protective and of decent quality. Still, I don't see the use for a kid's case without a stand."}

I went on Google app store and downloaded the apps and games for his age that were educational (which is what I purchased it for). The resolution is good for a toddler. The Rubber cover is thick. Haven't had a chance to see what the battery life will be, won't know until after Christmas. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Perfect price and quality for child's play!!!"}

I played some of the games to check speed and no problems there. The batteries on one of the two seemed to drain a bit quickly, but I'm not sure it was plugged in as long as the other so will have to keep an eye on that.  I think the boys will love them!  I did receive two blue ones instead of blue and red as ordered, but it is close to the holiday so I decided just to keep what was received.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "My husband and I purchased this tablet during a flash sale for about $45. This was intended for our son to use on our upcoming 16+ hour drive to see family during the holidays. The packaging was wonderful and easy to get the product out of. The tablet was easy to start up and use right out of the box, and the bumper seemed to protect it very well. There is also a slot for an external SD card. While that's all well and good, the tablet fails in every other way.\n\nThe screen is very difficult to look at and seems to change brightness and clarity as you tilt the tablet. Remember the changing pictures on sports cards or stickers we used to all get as kids? That's exactly what this feels like. I'm only able to properly see what's on the screen from one very specific angle. It's very hard on the eyes and my son will only use it for a few minutes. Not only is the screen terrible, but this tablet is the slowest piece of technology I've ever seen or handled. Movies are pretty much un-watchable, and forget trying to play a game or download an app even if you're connected to WiFi.\n\nIf you're looking for a cheap tablet because you fear your children might destroy it - this may be the way to go. If you need something functional that can be used for long periods of time, look elsewhere. I did give this product two stars, solely because of the great packaging, ease of set-up, and how sturdy it seems. You get what you pay for, and so I am returning this and ordering something different for my son."}

Also, the price was more than pleasing to our wallet (less than $100 for both).\nThese tablets are truly nice looking, light and child-color friendly, and fun to hold. For kids (or adults) that have not used a tablet before such as kindle, this will be a very good start and initiation into the world of tablets. Aesthetics aside, they're slow to boot and process pretty much any app on it very slowly. Some apps that are compatible with the any android are not supported by Orbo which makes it very frustrating (e.g. Amazon).\nThe content colors are dim even at the highest settings (they look blurry). Their app market is not as responsive either as the Kindle or Play Store, the navigation process is complex for novices like my family.\nIf they could just improve the processor, improve on color appearance/scheme, make it easy to navigate and find apps including from the android world (and also support them), and finally, make the Orbos faster even on wifi setting, then I would highly recommend the tablets. BUT FOR NOW, and am not an electronics whiz, the little I know to operate and navigate small gadgets and use them to surf the web, play games, watch movies, use interactive learning games for children, Orbo falls far short. Because of that, For now, am sorry, I do no recommend Orbo. It is a good start though, assuming this is their (Orbo's) first trial at tablet making. We were too frustrated using and navigating the Orbos that we returned both the following day after a few hours of wanting to find a reason to keep them."}

When it went on sale we thought this was a great deal. Then after getting it to finally hold a 36% battery charge once we started using it we noticed the issues it came with. First off.....this is NOT a kids tablet. It does NOT come kid ready. We had to manually create it and download apps that were kid lock savvy to make it that way. The relay from the touch screen is delayed, video footage is very choppy and certain settings wouldn't stay in place. It's a shame because it is a great size and weight and has a fun case but the technology isn't there behind it. Being returned immediately and canceling the one we purchased as a gift for our nephew. Super bummed!"}

I just finished setting up a Venue 7 for my son, and this for my youngest. It is already headed back. With KitKat on the 7 you can create a restricted user, no YouYube, no Browser...whatever you want. The capability is not there on this, there is not even an app by the manufacturer to accomplish any parental controls for a child user. Why would you make a child's tablet and give it free range to the ether? You may argue that I should be monitoring what they're doing, that's not why we buy these. We buy them to keep kids busy so they are not bothering us and we can focus on other things. I can hand the Venue to my son and know without a doubt, there is no chance of him being exposed to anything or buying crap. BAD product."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "I really tried to like this tablet for the 2 months that it lived.  The price was amazing.  The outer shell seemed sturdy.  We were going to use it as a back-up tablet for our son.  But, that's where I stop liking it.\n\n- The battery lasted at most 3 hours.  After the battery reached 50% it could no longer remain connected to our WI-FI network.\n- The screen had a weird glare on it or something that it just wasn't all clear at any particular angle.  Even when you looked at straight on, it was like the outer edges of the screen or certain spots seemed to black out a bit.  I kept trying to ignore it, and my son didn't seem to mind it, but I was worried about the effect it would have on his eyes.\n- It was somewhat slow in touch response.  That wasn't a big deal for us, as we don't play any speed games, but for others who do, that would drive you bonkers.\n\nWell, my son stepped on it in his room, and that was it.  I was almost relieved it was dead.\n\nI went out and bought another MEMO PAD 7.  Our old one that he used lasted a year with brutal toddler beatings and NO protective case.  It was the tablet that kept on chugging.  What finally killed it, after innumerable tantrum drops and stomps, was he took it in the bath with him.  It died, but only after I took it out from under the running water.  This time, I got a cover and screen protector film for his new one, and that battery lasts from 6AM to about 4PM, as he tends to leave it on around the house, and it stays connected the whole time to WI-FI.  It is very responsive to touch, and the screen is crystal clear for us.  I recommend that one."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "If you're looking for an inexpensive tablet your kids can use this is a pretty decent effort. It's dirt cheap, even the hardware you get.\n\nDon't expect a the performance of a full blown iPad or even a Nexus 7, but those cost at least 5.5 times the price of this. It runs most apps smoothly enough and basic games that you kids oughta enjoy. Also, since it only has 4GB of storage (even less is available for use), buying a fast SD card is a must.\n\nMy only complaints are with the battery and provided charger, you run out of juice really fast and the wall adapter is ridiculously weak, it charges really really slow, but just use a different one and you're settled.\n\nOverall, I think the price and pros beat the cons, so if you're looking for an inexpensive disposable tablet for children this will do."}

This item was purchased mainly for my 2yr old son to view videos, while viewing a video the entire thing just went silent. Now this tablet has not fallen and has not been mistreated as my son handles it with care, surprisingly. The audio issues are intermittent, sometimes it would work and sometimes its just silent. After seeing the joy on my son's face when I gave this to him, it hurts that I have to sent it back. However I would not be purchasing another one of its kind."}

The silicone case comes up a bit more than the actual screen of the tablet so the screen is protected from drops (assuming the screen doesn't hit the corner of a table on the way down), which is what was the selling point for us, as our son accidentally dropped his old tablet and the screen cracked. He has a great time playing games and learning on his Orbo Jr.\n\nMake sure you also purchase an SD card. My only complaint about this device is not enough internal storage space."}

I gave the product 3 stars because they are good quality with nice screens and they all functioned properly except for they don't keep charge for very long. I gave all of them two nights worth of charging. And tested them the two days and timed how long on the second day the batteries lasted with 100% charge. Two of the three tablets lasted only 1 1/2  hours of game play. The other tablet lasted appx. 2 hours. I expect a lot longer battery life for these. I don't want too always have to have my kids plug the tablets in especially if we are on long car rides. I think the internal batteries have been around for a while and they are going bad to have all 3 effected or they just have crappy batteries. If you don't mind plugging them in all the time then these are ok. Even if you break game play up like I do they just are annoying to charge."}

The app allows for a pin based control of what apps are available for the kids.\n\nStreaming apps like Pandora and Netflix work great after updating. Netflix does overpower the speaker with popping noise, but is perfectly clear with decent headphones. With every android device I've owned, I recommend moving all apps to the SD card to save memory.

It works fine on my network and my son loves it. My only issues with it are the extremely low battery life, three hours or less, long recharge time, and low screen resolution. I'm sure these are why the price is so low, but if I had realized how low res the screen was I would have looked elsewhere. Still, it gets the job done. I took off one star for those issues, and one star because the seller kept harassing me by email to post a review."}

The touch screen works well, a few times I have had to tap multiple times or more forcefully to make it recognize what I want to click.

It does it's job to keep the children from ripping the flesh off my face with their too-long fingernails when I'm trying to have a phone conversation. There is not a huge amount of space available for apps but again, zombie tablet. If your children are anything like mine, even one app on a tablet is enough to keep them thoroughly incapacitated for at least an hour, enough time to escape. I intend to purchase a second one for my other child simply because it provides the entertainment for a relatively low price and I can already see the tell-tale signs of zombification coming on. If you're not too picky about storage space and technical doohickeys, you just need something that is durable, lightweight, and entertaining for toddlers and children, then this is the tablet for you. Simply turn it on, launch it at the little flesh eating monsters and head for the hills."}

My son is obsessed with my iPhone which has the watch Disney jr app, so I was very disappointed when I was unable to download this app on the Orbo because its not compatible, which i didn't know at the time of purchase and I would not have bought it for that reason. Aside from that the tablet has a poor picture quality and sound which is okay for my 2 year old but it's also very slow and freezes frequently. My 2 year old gets frustrated because its so slow and he doesn't understand that he has to wait. Obviously for the price I got what I paid for but if I had to do all over again I would have went with the nubi or Samsung."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "I read through most of the reviews before I decided this would be the best product for my 3 yo sons birthday.  I purchased this in July 2014. I received it on time maybe a day early. The size is good. I was worried he would have a hard time holding and navigating through it 1 handed. He proved that to be an easy task. I checked out all the basics right away.\n\nPICTURE/VIDEO:The resolution is horrible. Unless you're sitting outside in direct sunlight you're just not going to be able to see much. It's grainy and just a mess.  But what does a 3 year old really need with a great camera anyway right?  So that isn't a big deal breaker. If you're looking for a tablet for awesome pictures look elsewhere. Nonetheless I taught him to use the camera. He loves taking pictures of himself and baby brother. Or screen grabs of his drawings.\n\nWIFI/SETTINGS: when I first purchased the tablet there was no issue getting connected. Recently when turning on the device it simply will not connect. My husband and I tired troubleshooting for a while freebie we decided to  power down and turn the device back on. After that it connects. But who wants to keep restarting it? The time on the device has also changed a few times. It's almost as If the settings I put it on just don't stay.\n\nI downloaded a lot of games and books, education friendly of course from the play store and amazon alike. They run like a dream. I have no stalling issues, or slow Internet speeds. It's just a as fast as using my galaxy and faster than my husband's laptop.\n\nThe battery life at first was about an hour. I thought I was going to lose my mind. Then I realized when I turned down the screens brightness it lasts about 4 hours. Which isn't bad. My son doesn't sit for 4 continuous hours.  So it lasts all day.\n\nOverall I would say it's a great little LEARNERS TABLET.  Great for teaching my son how to use apps, and learning to navigate through the tablet. Also responsibility.  He puts it away himself knows when to tell me it needs to be charged. He can whip through it with ease. I haven't tested it's durability though it did survive baby bros epic teething weeks!\n\nBottom line: I would buy more. They serve their purpose. I still consider them kiddie tablets or starter tablets."}

This device is rooted and won't play Ultraviolet movies. There is limited memory but it can be expanded with a micro SD card. The resolution is poor. The bumper is easily torn. The power button is difficult to access through the bumper.\n\nAll in all, I'm sort of satisfied. If it played Ultraviolet movies, I would rate it 3 stars. It does play Google Play movies and we were able to play those from the SD card. I was going to purchase one for my 4 year old daughter, but I will be looking for something different  for her."}

I never gave it to them and ended up returning it for a refund.\n\nCons:  The tablet would not charge by the MicroUSB port.  The user manual said it would, I tried contacting the manufacture, but they did not respond.\n\nThe display has a pretty narrow viewing angle.  It would have been difficult for both of my girls to watch something together and both be able to view the screen.\n\nThe battery is terrible.  I read the reviews and didn't think it would be a big deal...it is...it lost 30% of the charge in 4 hours without even being used.  There are some options to overcome this, but without being able to charge through the MicroUSB port, you are a little limited.\n\nPros:  Inexpensive, The Android platform allows you to put whatever Apps you want on it."}

I have a Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 and I expected it to be WAY worse than that because of the difference in price. I was definitely mistaken. Other than just a few drawbacks, I felt it worked really well for a kid (as intended) or for an adult as well. Sharp looking tablet underneath that rubber case! \nPros-\nClear picture (but also see cons below) and found it enjoyable to watch a Netflix movie on\nCan add extra external space up to 32gb\nRan all the apps I tried (sans 1  see cons below) perfectly fine.\nGreat for playing music, good sound\nRubber case really works (yes we dropped it) and even using it as an adult didn't find it so obtrusive that I minded using it with it on\nCons-\nNeeds more internal space.\nCould use a longer battery life  almost need to use it always plugged in.\nPicture is AMAZING, but only if you hold it in a certain position. Screen clarity greatly affected by slight movements.\nMy kids are addicted to Minecraft, which is a really resource intensive game. This tablet was not up to the task of running MInecraft sadly. So laggy it was almost unplayable. However absolutely every other kids app we tried seemed to work fine."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "I'm writing this review as an IT Professional who has a Samsung smartphone and who has an 8 year old with a Nexus 7 tablet.  So I'll make some comparisons to those items during this review.\n\nUpon initial purchase with a price tag under $60.00 I didn't have high hopes of getting something that would be usable....  So far we've had the tablet for a few weeks and absolutely LOVE IT.  Out of the box, it charged quickly and was easy to get used to using.  I LOVE the silcone cover which makes the device easy to handle, less likely to drop and much less likely to break if it is dropped.  My son's Nexus 7 has been replaced 3 times in 6 months due to the screen breaking (he has a cover on it but not a silcone one - it's a leather portfolio-type case).  Thankfully I purchased the protection plan for the Nexus, so it's been replaced each time - but I've also had to pay more to buy the protection plans each time it's been replaced than I had to pay for this entire tablet!  You can use the Play Store on this tablet, which I've found is unavailable on some other lower-end tablets, which is great.  I've downloaded Facebook and some of the light games my son and I play (Bingo Blitz, Minecraft, etc.) without issue.  Yeah, the tablet's a little slower than the Nexus but I've never had a problem playing these games.  The only app I've tried to download thus far that isn't compatible is the ABC News app.  However, seeing as this is marketed as a kids tablet.....not sure most kids would be put-off by this.... :)  I'm sure there are some other incompatible apps but I've yet to find another that I generally use.  The only true disappointment is the lack of a rear facing camera.  Now, once again, I'm not expecting some high-quality photos from the device but my kids tried to take a picture of our dog the other day and it was a little cumbersome trying to do that with only a forward facing camera.\n\nI would DEFINITELY buy this again - as a matter of fact, I probably WILL buy another one so that I can use this at home instead of my MUCH smaller smart phone.....  OH YEAH, speaking of which....this connects to my home Wifi BETTER than my Samsung smart phone - which was TOTALLY unexpected!\n\nFor the money spent, I would highly recommend this tablet as what it is marketed as - a KIDS Tablet.  I wish I'd seen this tablet before spending the money to purchase the Nexus 7.  The other bonus this tablet offers that the Nexus doesn't is an microSD slot!\n\nPros\nInexpensive\nBreak resistant silcone case\nInexpensive\neasy to use\nAndroid OS instead of some off the wall OS\nGood wireless connection\nInexpensive\nCharge via power cord OR universal USB charger - which we have at least 7 of - two of which are in the car\n\nCons\nSlower than the Nexus and my smart phone\nnot a multi-tasking device - it'll do it but VERY slowly\nNo rear-facing camera\nlow quality images from camera - but what do you really expect from a $60 tablet?"}

That was not an option and the reviews were decent for this item so I went and ahead and ordered it for his birthday.  We drained the battery like it said, charged fully, and after that the battery only lasted for around 40 minutes.  We charged again,  battery only lasted 30 minutes.  After trying to charge it yet AGAIN,  it won't even charge.  Extremely disappointed because I read all the reviews and thought it would be perfect for him.  He was excited when he opened it but very disappointed when it was dead within 40 minutes.  Sending back and buying something else.  This is one of those \"you get what you pay for\" deals.  Don't expect to get a good tablet for this price.  My kindle fire that is 3 years old still holds a charge for 3-4 hours of solid use.  I was expecting at least an hour or more with this.  No such luck.  Save your money!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "To begin, I would like to echo other reviewers' observations. This is not a kid-tablet. It is a normal 7 inch low-end tablet slipped into a rubber case.  Specifically, it is the Chromo Inc. 7 inch table that you can find also on amazon here: http://www.amazon.com/Chromo-Inc%C2%AE-Android-Capacitive-Multi-Touch/dp/B009W49ALA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1405528129&sr=8-1&keywords=chromo#productDetails\n\nEven the model numbers match up.  We ordered a Pink Orbo and a Blue Orbo. We received a Pink Chromo (model 2543A) in pink case and a White Chromo (model 2419A) in a blue case.\n\nSo I guess the real question is whether you want to pay an extra $9 for the rubber case? The case does seem to add a level of drop protection, but it also makes the tablet more difficult to use.  While the rubber (or maybe silicone) case has apertures for many of the tablets features, it does not for all of them. I had to cut a notch into the top right corner to provide access to the headphone jack.  Also the case makes it difficult for little hands to use the power button and the volume rockers. Probably my next step will be to butcher the case further to allow access to those controls.\n\nI find myself regularly removing the tablet from the case frequently, as do my children.  So unless you plan on doing significant case modifications, and are in a situation where kids are likely to drop the tablet onto hard surfaces, I really have to question the utility of a case that ups the cost by 20%.\n\nAll that said the tablets were very useful for us on last week's road-trip.  The onboard memory will support games and a movie or two.  The specs here indicate the memory is expandable by microSD cards.  When I opened the packages the tables are marked TFflash. They are acutally the same thing and you can use your microSD card to expand memory.\n\nMy single biggest beef with these tablets is the recharge issue.  Off a full charge, you'll get maybe 3 hours of tablet life. That's fine. But when I went to charge them via the miniUSB port, they don't work.  Tablets ship with a AC to DC (5v) charger that fits into a tiny port on top of the tablet. That's fine for overnight charging at home. But not every car has AC outlets. Fortunately we have a 12v adapter that plugs into our cigarette outlet into which we could plug the chargers.  However, the chargers are cheap. If your kids are using the tablets while they are plugged into the charger, there is a good chance they will bend the charge plug.\n\nAlso, when I first looked at the tablet page here on Amazon, I thought it had specified a rear-facing camera. This is not the case and only a front (user facing) camera is included.\n\nThe hardware is a little finicky. I've not experienced the quick battery depletion, or random shutdown that other users have experienced.  However, sometimes the tablets do not want to turn on, and may require a couple restarts. And though the two models should have the same OS (Android 4.2) they act just a little differently.  Screens are of comparable color saturation and brightness. The screens do have a limited optimum viewing angle, and a slight tilt the wrong direction makes it hard to see. So two siblings trying to look at the same screen while one is holding it may impact the quality of experience.\n\nKnowing what I know now, I would not bother buying this tablet under the Orbo Jr. name.  I'd just buy the Chromo version and save the $9.."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "This is an inexpensive yet durable tablet that keeps the little one busy. He has dropped it about a dozen times on the hardwood floors. As others have stated it is a full blown android tablet. The battery does goes quick, however if you turn off the WiFi when there is no need for it; it does extend the battery. At first, it was a bit of trick to download games but it was my new router that was not playing well with the tablet, after resolving this its perfectly fine. It streams Netflix fine but under load you will see some lag, just make sure you close apps and you can avoid this problem (be aware you need patience when things get locked up). My only take away is the max volume level---it really isn't too great (unless you have headphones). I am happy with it and so is the little guy."}

The screen is really hard to see and almost seems like its supposed to be 3-D. I have no problem seeing it if I hold it at an angle. It also takes a long time to power on.\n\nWith the case on its really hard to find the power and on/off buttons. However, the case is very durable. The camera is decent for a tablet but there's no flash so you have to have really good lighting in order to get a decent picture.\n\nI do like that its an android. It's really easy to download games or surf the web. And since my smart phone is an android I was very familiar with the lay out and could find my way around it very easily. I like that there's a screenshot button right on  the screen instead of having to hold down two separate buttons simultaneously. I was also able to access my google+ account and redeem pictures from there which was a nice feature.\n\nThis tablet charges fast but the battery runs down really fast too. My kids couldn't watch a full length movie without the battery dying.\n\nOverall this tablet is okay for little kids as long as you keep it charged regularly."}

Shipping could have been faster I ordered on the 11th and got it on the 24th.\nupdate. still having issues with this tablet! contacted amazon about this!\n\nhavent had it long. some days it works, others it doesnt. it either freezes or won't load at all. it never is drained of battery. there is no way to factory reset once it freezes like most decent android tablets so this is basically useless! have contacted amazon and hope to get my money back b/c id rather go spend a few extra bucks on a real android tablet that has better guarantee and trustworthy."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "I expected a dumbed down tablet type system in a bulky hard case. What I got was a 7\" android tablet in a soft slip on silicon type cover. The tablet isn't a \"kids edition\" type device. It is a fully functional WiFi tablet. It is up to the parent to put the kid apps on it. It has the Google play store like any Android phone or tablet. YouTube, internet explorer, user facing camera,email, and other basic tablet apps. The silicon case stays on the device very well and the buttons are easy to operate through the case. This device is great for anyone, not just a kid. For the price, you can't beat it. My 3 & 7 yr old will be fighting over it for a while. It does get bogged down when trying to do a lot if tasks at once but so does my Samsung tablet. This seems to be a quality item, just be prepared to spend some time adding the kid friendly apps yourself when the item arrives."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "I'm not sure, really, what  I was expecting with this tablet.  I figured, something minimal that little ones could play with,  What it is - a full featured tablet that is worlds better than my FIRST tablet.\n\nPROS:  It is quick and responsive, lightweight, good graphics, expandable storage (microSD slot), runs off of Android (not some off the wall, proprietary OS), the rubber bumper DOES come off, so an adult could easily get one of these for themselves.  It will charge off of the USB port, so you don't need a special car adapter, and if you are transferring files from your 'main' computer, it is also charging the battery.\n\nIt is about the size of a Kindle Fire (without the rubber bumper) - so the cases made for the Kindle should fit it.\n\nCONS:  It can only do one thing at a time - if you are downloading applications, wait until one is completely finished downloading before attempting another download or you are doomed to frustration.  WiFi only goes to 'g', not 'n', so you trade off a little speed there, but nothing noticeable The camera is elementary, and the pictures it takes reflect this.  Would be fine for Skype, but don't expect good photos from it.\n\nOverall - yes, a good little tablet and worth the price - either for little ones OR an adult."}

Setup was major easy and I've already downloaded several free games through the play store.\n\nThis is a birthday gift for my grandson and I can't wait to see his face when he opens it!\n\nI just ordered another one for my other grandson, I'm sure he'll be excited too. The only problem is color choice, blue or pink, and since they're both boys and siblings, blue was the only appropriate choice, so well have to use markers and put their names on the back.\n\nInitial review is good. Will update AFTER the boys start using them.  Thank you!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "For the price of this tablet, it is a great deal.\n\nThe body is made of plastic, just like many tablets on the market. This keeps the device strong and light at the same time. Due to the small form factor it is great for little hands. Also, there is a silicone sleeve that serves as a bumper, to protect the tablet if dropped.\n\nFrom an adult standpoint, the device works great. You get the stock Android, which is easier to learn. I played with it, and was able to carry out the same task as I would on my \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-2-10-1/dp/B007M50PTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1</a>\".\n\nFrom my sons point of view, who has a \"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Nabi-Jr/dp/B008DBI5RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Nabi Jr.</a>\", and he loved it. I set it down and left the room, what a big mistake. I returned and it was glued to his little hands all night.\n\nThis is not to say this tablet is the same as the Nabi Jr., but for the price it can't be beat considering it is one third the price. Also, there are multiple android apps that can be downloaded to give more of a Nabi like experience, if that is what you are trying to mimic."}

There was no stoping my son from taking it with us. To my amazement this little tablet held up great. It was dropped tossed around in tents back packs. Now that we are back home I'm running if through its passes and I'm very impressed.\nI'd recommend this to anyone want a first tablet for a  child."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "Tablet is durable and the outside case that comes with it is very comfortable to hold and fits well in my child's hands. Although he is just a toddler the screen responded very well to his little fingers. As far as surfing the internet the tablet is fast and it renders games and videos great! Would have been five stars if only the battery lasted longer."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00K0S2J1A", "review": "Tablet is a great product. It's big screen has great quality and very clear. It would be great as a starter tablet for anybody, not just kids. I got it for my daughter, and I have just as much fun on it as she does. The tablet does get pretty hot if being used for a long period of time, and it does seem to lag a bit. In the middle of an app, if the low battery warning comes on, or if I put the tablet down for a minute and the backlight gets turned off, it'll say the app isn't responding and forces it to shut down."}

I am contacting the company tomorrow."}

Not only is the tablet easy to use and quite accessible, but the rubber case on the outside makes it that much more amazing. I am not concerned (as much) when it gets dropped because the case on the outside seems to soak up all of the shock. Its a fun color and gives the littles a more than just visual stimulation."}
