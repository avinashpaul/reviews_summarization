{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJDS", "review": "**REVIEW UPDATED ON 7/30/13 - Updated speakers, \"other features\", battery life, gripes**\n\nFor anyone on the fence, and especially for those frustrated by the performance slowdown issues with the original Nexus 7 tablet, don't let that scare you off from buying the second generation model.\n\nGoogle made all of the right improvements to the product, and the result is a significantly improved product for a marginally higher cost. Only time will tell if this unit suffers the same performance fate as the original model (for those not familiar, over time, the first generation tablets tended to quickly slow down and struggle to perform even basic tasks like browsing the internet). However, Android 4.3 feels ultra-smooth so far, and I am hoping that Google and Asus learned from their original mistakes.\n\nSCREEN: The new screen is absolutely stunning. Some people argue that the resolution of 323 pixels per inch is unnecessary, but you can really see the difference when you use it in person. Text is significantly sharper and a little easier on the eye to read. Using the tablet to watch videos and see pictures produces a stunning result.\n\nPROCESSOR: This is the #1 reason I'd recommend this new, upgraded Nexus 7 over the older version. The speed upgrade is unquestionably immense, and to those who have used the older and newest model Nexus 7, you will notice and appreciate this immediately. Apps load instantly; the internet browsing experience is smooth and a very welcome upgrade over past performance. It's strange; a few days ago I was satisfied with the decent albeit declining performance of my 1st Gen Nexus 7. Now that I have this new one, I use them both side by side and the older model feels like a dinosaur. This alone is reason enough to upgrade.\n\nSIZE/WEIGHT: The reduced thickness and weight of the tablet is very noticeable. I often times used my old Nexus 7 tablet while sitting in bed, to check email and browse the web prior to going to sleep. Holding the old Nexus in one hand, and the new one in the other, the differences in size and weight are VERY noticeable. No doubt will provide a more comfortable long term usage experience, especially for extended sessions while on flights or the subway.\n\nBATTERY LIFE: After a couple days of using this new Nexus 7, I can confidently say that the battery life has been significantly improved over the original model. My previous session of about 2 hours straight of use (screen on, using apps that draw semi-frequent data over wi-fi) drained only 20% of the battery life. If I project this out, it would tell me that I could get 10 hours of constant use on one full charge. I haven't run through an entire charge yet from 100% down to 0% (I've been recharging after each use), but I'll try to get to that sometime this week and report back on my total real-world battery life.\n\nCAMERAS: Google added a rear-facing Camera on this new second gen Nexus. While I typically wouldn't use my tablet as a camera, I have tried it out and it takes excellent pictures. Focuses quickly, the images are sharp and the low light performance, while not great, is better than I would have expected. The front-facing camera gets more use for me (I use my tablets to Skype with family). The new front facing camera is noticeably sharper and better in lower light situations than the original Nexus 7 camera was. In low light, the old model was almost unusable. The 2nd gen Nexus 7 low light performance is very acceptable.\n\nSPEAKERS: I've now spent some time using this second-gen Nexus 7 side by side with my original Nexus 7. Separately, they both sound very acceptable for speakers from small tablets. Using them side by side, the improvements to the Nexus 7 are very noticeable, and the sound is more clear even at high volumes. I'd say that this new model sounds far less \"tinny\" than the original Nexus did. Personally, I don't use the built-in speakers often (I'm normally either listening with headphones, or using bluetooth audio to my Logitech Boombox). But for people who do use the built-in speakers to play music or watch movies, you will appreciate the improvement in the speakers.\n\nOTHER FEATURES: Last night, I realized that this tablet is compatible with Qi Wireless Charging, a discovery which made me VERY happy. I use a Nexus 4 cell phone, and I keep it on my nightstand on the Google Nexus Charging Orb. I attempted to use the orb with this new Nexus 7 tablet, and it worked perfectly. You have to sit the tablet landscape, with the orb centered on the tablet, and it synced up and began charging instantly.\n\nCOMPARISONS: I will update this section shortly with my comparison review between this 2nd Gen Nexus 7, the iPad Mini, and the Kindle Fire HD, as soon as I've had more time to test them all side by side.\n\nGRIPES AND COMPLAINTS: Here, I'll list any gripes that I have about the tablet. My first major gripe is that I am not a huge fan of the texture/material used on the back of the tablet. It's a slightly rubberized feeling coating, which I assume they did to create additional grip. However, I've been finding that after holding with one hand for a few minutes, I notice the tablet starting to slide a little bit in my hand. I think this is a combination of the new texture plus the fact that it's thinner than it used to be. I'm probably going to be purchasing a case for it shortly, which should alleviate this problem, but it is still worth noting. This is just a personal preference things (if you normally hold it landscape w/ two hands, you'll probably prefer this new texture over the old one).\n\nAll in all, I am VERY impressed with how much faster this tablet is than my original Nexus 7 tablet. As long as this model doesn't suffer the performance slowdown issue of the original Nexus 7, I don't anticipate moving this away from a 5 star product anytime soon, but only time will tell I guess. I will keep this review updated as I go, and add thoughts on more features once I test them out further (the speakers, longer term battery life tests, performance slowdown, etc). If you have anything else you want me to address, please let me know in the comments section and I will be glad to address it."}

The screen is crisp, responsive, stereo speakers are great. And the thin body frame makes it a breeze to hold. It is a huge improvement over previous model. It leaves a lot to be desired from other manufacturers. But the big question as of now is its reliability. So far it looks and feels great, no flaws uncovered yet. But my last year's Nexus 7 experience left a lot to be desired.

I'd suggest getting a $250-300 hd smartphone with a 5\" or bigger screen instead since most will have better hardware and performance for the price.\n\nPro: The Nexus 7 has a simple and easy to use UI.\nCon: No MicroSD expansion is a big deal breaker.

Replacing the battery is really hard (difficult to pry open the case), so I'm glad it wasn't the battery.  I still would recommend the Nexus 7 for its features and screen resolution, but it does has a software issue."}

It was finally time to treat myself to a gadget and because I can't get all the gear I want I did a lot of research and picked out the Nexus 7. Our family has 2 kindle fires--one is my husband's and the other is the kindle I used to have which I gave my son.  I knew I wanted an android tablet and I have been very pleased with the Nexus 7.  I do so many things with it from playing games (from the Google Play Store) to looking up recipes, listening to music (the speakers are okay or I use ear buds), to watching online video.  I think this was a good purchase.  I do have a bit of a problem sometimes hitting the buttons on the side and shutting it off instead of lowering the volume (both buttons sit on the side).  It has not frozen up on me very much nor does it re-start like the kindle did."}

Many people didn't like the bezels, I love them, 'cause they allowed me to grab my tablet and not cover the screen with my fingers.

It is an excellent alternative to my iPad 9.7 Pro for reading Kindle books and the daily newspaper. The 7\" screen is too small--relative to my eyesight--to really enjoy magazines from Zinio or Texture. Performance is smooth and efficient. Since I don't use the device everyday, it tends to take a while to boot as there almost always seems to be more than a few apps awaiting to be downloaded/upgraded. I suppose that is a good thing that apps are far more frequently updated than on iOS and I am fully aware that I don't have to download apps the second I turn the device on. I do wish that it was iTunes compatible but that is no fault of Asus. For my intended purpose, the Asus Nexus 7 16 GB is a great tablet. Just confirm whether or not Google is still supporting the latest Android OS. They may have stopped with the last version."}

For the price, the \"retina\" display, processing package and android updates, it cannot be beat. It's 2016 now and this tablet is still running strong. The build quality helps it age very well. However, the battery size has decreased which led to this new model to become more thin, and I wouldn't say that it was a good thing. Although the smaller battery can still easily get me though the day, the thinness along with less grippier backing compared to the previous model makes it a bit harder to hold. But that is all nit-picking. I can't wait for the next release!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJDS", "review": "Best Android tablet for the price, that I've seen. Excellent display, fast processor, ok sound. This is the 4th one I've purchased. I bought the 2012 model for my 12 year-old son, when they first came out. He liked it so much (so did I), that I bought my husband and myself each a Nexus, the following year. I didn't even realize at the time, that there had been so many changes made, for the 2013 model. All for the better! I actually felt guilty, because as good as my son's 2012 model was....this 2013 model knocked it flat! The only con we've seen, with either model, is that over time the charging port becomes very loose, and you have to become innovative with how you get the charger to stay plugged in and charging. We didn't encounter this problem til well after a year, though. I just ordered our 4th 2013 tablet, as another gift. 16gb has been more than enough room for my husband and I. Of that 16gb, you actually get around 12gb of storage. My husband and I each have a few game apps, and some sports, news, weather apps, and Facebook. We mostly just surf the web, and look up music on youtube. We've each only used about 8gb. However, my son downloads whole movies/videos, and has a ton of game apps and music, too, and he has had to delete stuff to free up storage for new stuff. If you plan on keeping movies or videos on your device, go with the 32gb, for sure."}

I accidentally turn it off all the time, while I was actually trying to lower the volume. Battery life isn't stelar either, but it could be that I'm using it all the time.\nIf you're on a budget and looking for a tablet that is good and won't break the bank this it it.

The first couple of days it is constantly asking if you want to update, because it goes through each version of Android.  Once it is done, the updates become part of the factory reset so the OS does not need to update again until a new version is released.\n\nThe display is quite nice, to me.  Note that I generally don't buy high-end devices so if you are coming from one, your opinion may differ.\n\nReasons that I did not give five stars:\n- No micro SD slot.  The 16GB is large enough for day-to-day use, but I was working on a short-term project where more space would have been nice.\n- Occasionally the screen becomes less responsive and I have to touch it a few times before it will respond.  A restart fixes this issue.\n- The auto-brightness setting does not work as well as Id like.  Sometimes it is too bright for conditions and other times too dim, so I manually adjust it.

Using it for the drone FPV, it is a bit laggy at times and skips occasionally (probably a half dozen times in 3 hours of flight), which isn't a big deal for me. Bottom line - it works great, is super fast, has GPS ( GLONASS as well), Bluetooth, Wifi, everything you need in a tablet and one more thing: it's super light. I'm able to fly with this attached to the remote for an hour with my arms not even feeling it at all. It's really light, and I love that for the purposes I bought it for. This is an awesome tablet, and the price cannot be beat for the specs (go ahead, compare them yourself to 2016 tablets specs)."}

The Nexus 7 (2013) has been a fantastic small tablet, but the screen spontaneously cracks.  My first lasted a couple years, but it broke, and with replacements I've had 3 break in the bast 6 months, 2 of them in the past 3.  I don't know if this is a question of materials deteriorating over time since whatever you buy now has been sitting in a warehouse since they stopped making them a couple years ago, or what.  But I set it down, and pick it up a couple hours later and find the screen spontaneously cracked which, because the touchscreen digitizer is fused to the glass, renders the tablet useless."}

The charging port is an industry standard, cheap part, but it's the weak link in all these refurbished tablets.  My real complaint is with the 3rd party seller (BuyFromUs2012) but you can only leave seller feedback for 90 days after purchase, so I'm posting a warning to any potential customers here:  Don't buy from these guys!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJDS", "review": "I think it's good to find reviews that are a little further out from just a couple weeks from purchase. So here is one a couple years from purchase.\n\nThere are many aspects about this tablet that I received as a Christmas gift in 2013. Portability. Great size. Clarity. Ease of use. Great GPS access. Accessibility to file storage missing on Apple Tablets, and much more.\n\nHowever, there have been a number of disappointments along the way.\n\nFirst, the device rebooted at random, incessantly, at the start. As new releases of Android rolled out, this happened with far less regularity. But it still happens. I am happier that it is less frequent now. This was very common when I bought this.\n\nSecond, the headphone jack stopped producing stereo some time ago. That is disappointing for good effect when watching videos with headphones. Bluetooth is the only way to obtain stereo with the right speakers.\n\nThird, I find that blue tooth has a hard time connecting to devices. A Christmas present I received this past year was a wireless speaker cube. I had been unsuccessful pairing the device until I recently completed a factory reset on the tablet. Keeping my fingers crossed that this will continue to work.\n\nFourth, the accelerometer appears to have failed. Google Sky no longer works. Compass apps and levels (such as Bubble) no longer work. I was told this is a rare occurrence for this tablet, but it's a downer none the less. I wonder if this doesn't effect auto-tilt, which isn't always responsive.\n\nWith all these issues, I would rate the tablet with 1 or 2 stars, if I didn't still love what it can do so much."}

If it wasn't for the battery issues, this could've easily been 4 stars."}

This probably saved this device and me some money."}

But nothing, in my humble opinion, compares to this tablet for its price point. I use it daily and have had zero issues with it. Because it's a pure Android device (Google), it is not loaded with bloatware from the manufacturer like all of the other tablets. Recently I purchased one of the latest greatest Samsung Galaxy Pro tablets with a faster processor and 3 gigs of ram (1 more gig than the Nexus).  But with having numerous tabs open and playing games, it ran slower!  All the \"junk\" that came installed on that tablet was using 1.5 to 2.0 gigs of ram! So back it went.\n\nMine has only storage for 16 gigs and I haven't had any storage issues. Probably because I use my phone for pictures and Facebook. And various clouds.\n\nI've never had a screen protector. I just clean the screen when necessary with a micro fiber cloth or cotton diapers. I spray a solution of 50% rubbing alcohol and 50% water and wipe off. The same thing I use on my HDTV's.  I did order from Amazon a black Poetic case cover as it fit perfectly, is light, and when you close the cover, it automatically turns the tablet off due to a thin magnet inside of the cover. I also purchased a SlimPort HDMI adapter (display port) so I can just plug a regular HDMI cord into it and the TV to watch movies, YouTube, etc.\n\nFinally, I just ordered a new one, that also comes with the official tablet cover, from Groupon for $119. I normally get everything from Amazon but the price has been going up recently. That in itself tells you how popular this tablet is!!!\n\nI hope this helps. It truly is a nice, snappy, smooth tablet."}

I also have touch screen issues every once in a while, the screen adds crazy symbols and letters that I did not touch, once again I power it down and back up and it works fine. I do wish it had a USB connection for multiple reasons but it is what it is, I will try to down load some movies for the plane ride when we go on vacation and let you all know how that goes.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJDS", "review": "If you are a college student, and you want an inexpensive tablet that can help you study, entertain and update news, then Nexus 7 from Google is an ideal candidate. It costs only about $150. This medium-sized tablet is very handy, lightweight, portable and has two standout features that people will love: Android Lollipop and great display.\n\nAndroid Lollipop\nAndroid Lollipop is the latest version of the Android operating system made by Google. This version brings the screen experience to the next level when your every interaction is animated. Basically every time you touch, swipe or zoom in or out, the operating system brings something to the screen; so you know exactly what just happens and where things are going. There are a lot of helpful animations enabled throughout different applications. For example, when you text your friend by typing on the virtual keyboard, there is always a small wave coming out from the center of the button you touch; it not only gives you the experience of pressing an actual button but also makes sure you hit the correct one. All the transitions or transposes are running on consistently high frame rate of 60 frames per second, which brings the smooth, intuitive and responsive interactions. A cheap table that is able to run Lollipop will bring college students both monetary satisfaction and user experience contentment.\n\nDisplay\nI love the Nexus 7 display. It is a 1200 by 1920 pixel panel, which give a pixel density of 320 pixels per inch. That is one of the sharpest pixel density values on the market of tablets right now, and any college student would love to Netflix and chill on this screen. Nexus 7 also has a very bright display, coming in handy with the auto-brightness feature, which is doing a great job adjusting your surrounding environment. Those high resolution and auto-brightness features give a great reading experience. You can easily bring this portable device to school and read on it without having to carry your heavy textbooks. The device size aspect of 16:9 fits perfectly with almost all the videos, from watching university lectures on Coursera to referencing tutorials on Youtube. This handy mobile device helps you a lot with studying, especially when there are a ton of flash card or tutorial applications on Google Play Store for you to download.\n\nNexus 7 is a very thin device, which leads to its drawback of having short battery life. However, the thinness gives us a very lightweight device at about only 0.64 pounds. Even though it has short battery life, it still lasts for about a day, which is good enough for you to do your work in school.\nI highly recommend college students to try out this economical but effective mobile device. It helps you studying or relaxing anytime you need. Especially, like me, if you want to get involved in developing applications for Android, this medium-size device proves to be very useful for testing."}

We've been using them daily since early December and they have never been mishandled from the time we received them. One of the tablets is working fine. The other one started having touchscreen issues right out of the box; at first it was bearable and just barely noticeable. After a couple of months it is now extremely aggravating to use. Touch recognition just flickers all over the screen with every tap and long-press is all but impossible. Trying to type, it has started producing random triples of any keystroke and registers input from places up to an inch away from the location of the touch.

The 1 major problem I'm having with it is that the GPS is not nearly as accurate as my iPhone.\nThe GPS is set to high accuracy in the Location settings but it still shows me to be about 80-90ft from where I really am. Even when I use other GPS apps, other than just Google Maps, and input the Lat/Long into at satellite map on the desktop/website it still shows the wrong place.\nBeing 10ft I could almost deal with but 90ft with a drone set to follow or orbit me is a bad thing.\nThe other problem with the GPS is not only is 90ft most of the time it also likes to drift a lot or jump the blue dot even further away and back again. And this is after letting the Map app sit for about 5-10 even 20 or 30 mins. Mean while compared to my iPhone that's also using Google Map app the blue dot hasn't moved and if it has it's barely anything at all.\nI may have to get a bluetooth GPS receiver and hope that helps.\n\nSpeaking of the GPS, it'll suck the hell out of your battery. So keep that in mind.\n\nI also don't know if this normal for the Nexus 7 or what but the one I got the battery was completely dead. I've never had this happen on a brand new, unopened, device until now. I own a lot of tech gadgets and they've mostly all had a charge on the better. Unless the device has a NiCd battery, then it makes sense when the battery is empty. But with a Li-ion battery there should always be at least a 50-80% charge on new devices other wise it could actually hurt the battery. So I had to let it sit and charge for about 20-30mins before it would come up. Plus it didn't help when I looked into what the 5 flashing light meant on the Nexus and see a bunch of stories of people not having their Nexus not working any more or having to do some voodoo to make it work after they have let the battery completely drain, it can be a bit of a fright.\n\nNow this isn't a point against the Nexus itself but more against Google, which is why I didn't knock any stars off. The Nexus 7 comes with Android 4.2 (or was it 4.3, I forget, not that it matters in this case) but to update to the latest version of Android (6.01) you have to install every little update between them first. So first I had to go through all of the 4.4.x, then the 5.x and then finally 6 to get 6.01. I don't understand why they could just make the update go straight from \"old\" version to \"latest\" version.\nI have yet to see anyone talk about this type of thing and it's just something I have to get out there."}

Definitely buy the 2013 version if you want a Nexus 7.\n\nWhat's great:\n- Screen is bright enough to be seen in outdoors weather when needed\n- Comparable battery life to your phone/other tablet. I use mine heavily for productivity purposes (not video) and it lasts 2 days on a charge.\n- Loud sound with built-in speakers.\n- Rear camera has decent quality; front camera sucks but you really only use it for Skyping.\n- Feels structurally solid.\n- Has a notification LED (was missing in previous version).\n\nNot so great:\n- No external SD card slot\n- With the Poetic case, the microphone picks up a lot of extra noise if you handle the device while recording or Skyping. Microphone is on the side, where you can cover it with your hand if you're not careful. Set it down on a flat surface and it picks up sound well, though."}

Took this tablet on a cross country train trip a couple of years ago and it was awesome for music, reading, entertainment and messaging friends. It's just well made, plenty fast enough, great display, and just feels good in your hand.\n\nI love it so much that this is my 4th Nexus 7. I lost one, broke 2. After #3 I decided not to get another one, but I really missed having it for reading my blogs and magazines at the end of the day.  #3 is sitting in a drawer with a cracked screen which I recently unsuccessfully tried to repair. Even though the repair failed ( my fault) it still fired up broken and that's when I saw that it was going to update all the way to the latest version of Android, Marshmallow (6.0.1).\n\nFor the price it was a no brainer to get another one and I couldn't be happier.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice, quality Android tablet with a great display that will update to Marshmallow, you can't go wrong with this ASUS. 2-3 years after it's initial release it still stands up well against other, newer tablets of this size, specs and price range. Actually I haven't seen one better.\nASUS  hit it out of the park."}

While fast, the Nexus 7 keeps dropping Internet connection for no apparent reason - something that is not happening with other mobile devices using the same wifi network.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJDS", "review": "This is an excellent android tablet.  I have purchased my children other tablets and I am often annoyed at how laggy they are.  Also, they constantly have to uninstall apps to install new apps.  That is also a major annoyance.  My last complaint with most tablets is that the micro usb is a fragile port.  I say that b/c most people I know, adults and children, break them!  I have not personally broken any, but this happens A LOT.  This tablet fixes all of those complaints.  Because it is stock android, it is zippy.  No lag what-so-ever, even after updating to marshmallow.  It has 16 gb and that is plenty for installing apps.  She has installed way more apps than she could on her last tablet and she still has many GB's left.  Lastly, we charge it wirelessly.  No worry about breaking the micro-usb port.  It isn't the newest tablet on the market, but for me, it is one of the best, and it runs the newest android os with no issues.  Worth every penny!"}

Overall very easy to use, incredibly versatile. Highly recommended for anyone."}

I bought my wife a Nexus 7 back in 2013, and the device is still going strong and she uses it every day. This past Christmas, I bought my kids the same device and they love it. I was a little concerned in purchasing with all of the reviews about the upgrade to lollipop 1.1, but these devices came with jellybean and upgraded in the first boot to marshmallow, no issues after update. Great product!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJDS", "review": "Excellent tablet ... 5 stars.  Sold back my 2012 version to Amazon for some credit and upgraded to the 2013 version which is still being made as of October 2015 (the date on my new one).  I purchased it from Amazon directly as it seems they are selling recently made versions.  It had a holiday special sale price, so for a little over hundred dollars (after sell back credit) I was able to essentially upgrade my older tablet to a brand new one after 3 years of use and hopefully get another 3 years.  This version is a tremendous price/performance value in and of itself right now, but for me, I look at it that for $325 ($200 originally paid for 2012 version plus the 2013 upgrade cost) I essentially am getting use of an amazing piece of computing power that is consistently relevant for the times - for 6 total years.  That sounds like superb value when one looks at the alternatives.  I say consistently relevant above because 1) Google is very good with releasing timely Android updates to this device and 2) it is 2016 and this device pretty much has the same hardware as from 2013 and yet it is just as competitive now in terms of performance as it was three years ago.  There's not much other tablets are doing better if arguably anything.  Although I enjoyed the earlier one, this version is much improved over the 2012 version and I highly recommend it.  It is buttery smooth with the faster processor and the 2gb of ram.  The Google ecosystem of products/services is terrific.  When combined with Android (and some excellent tablet hardware like this) one could not ask for more.  I also own a Chromebook and between Chrome OS on the chromebook, Chrome browser on windows, and Android on tablet, things just work very seamlessly across all devices.  The upgrade to Marshmallow went smoothly as device was already preloaded either Jellybean or Kitkat with two to three restarts thereafter to upgrade to Marshallow.  One restart to upgrade to Lollipop (Android v5) then another to upgrade to Marshmallow.  Also highly recommend the devicewear ridge case to go with it.  Hopefully Google continues to keep this 7-inch form factor that is the Nexus 7 product going forward in future iterations as it is clearly a winner."}

If your getting this to replace a Nexus 7 2012, I suggest you root the old unit and put Kit Kat back in as it will perform just as fast as Marshmallow in the 2013 unit and works fine. All you need to root it is a Mac, Win 8.1 PC or a linux the Java 7 SDK and the proper OS. Download it anyhow as Jave/Oracle is going to stop giving it away except for the simply non developmental Java.  Rooting allows you to pick exactly what Operating System goes in and you can remove pesky Android and Verizon or ATT programs. This is the 2013 model for bwifi only. Runs great price is rite.

It might not have the latest or the greatest hardware but it's a Nexus device so you can upgrade to Marshmallow right away which means you'll have Google's latest software shortly after opening the package. If your a power user and need the newest and the best technology then this tablet might not be for you but if your an average person looking for a great tablet that won't break the bank then this tablet has more than enough power and features to keep you happy. The screen is bright and beautiful. The battery life and speakers are very good. The is processor is very quick and snappy with little to no lag and 2GB's of RAM means you'll be able to do plenty of multitasking. There are many similarly priced tablets but most only have 1GB of RAM. That 2nd GB or RAM definitely makes a difference.\n\nThere are some cons with this tablet. The camera is not that great but most camera's on tablets aren't. It also does not have a slot for an SD card so there is no expandable storage but these are things I can easily live with. If you look at all the specs you get for the price it's easy to see this tablet is an amazing value and an excellent buy."}

The cases all have magnets that render apps which need GPS, including compass, and astronomy apps, useless. Still hoping I can find a case that will work and, in any event, this is more a complaint about the cases than the Nexus. The other problem is about the microphone. It is far too easy to overdrive and distort the microphone, and there is apparently no way to adjust the gain even with third party apps. Also, there is no microphone input so there is no easy way to use an external mic, although I've seen some schemes where it may be possible to jerry rig an ext. mic thru the usb input. This is a major problem for me since I am a music teacher. I hope google is working on a solution for this. The iphones I've worked with have far superior microphones."}

I have previously owned Asus products, including the aging Transformer TF300T, which this tablet was purchased to replace. Overall, Asus knew what they were doing.\n\nOnce I received this tablet, right out of the gate I installed Kali Linux Nethunter (which has native images for this tablet - this was part of the reason I chose the 7 - the other being it was pure Android and fairly compact) - after about a day or so of finagling with a number of root toolkits and image flashing, I finally got Kali working on it. After a little more testing, I discovered the Nexus 7's wireless adapter does not support monitor mode or injection, however, since the Lollipop-based Kali kernel natively supports both USB OTG and Y-Cables, I just grabbed a cheap TP-LINK TL-WN722N to connect externally for wireless penetration testing. While the adapter hasn't arrived yet, I'm confident it will work very well.\n\nPlus, I won't be using it for this all of the time, so it's really not a big deal to have an external adapter.\n\nThis is really not enough to dock a star, as it's something most people won't even bother with - and for everything else I use it for (mobile gaming, web browsing, social networking), the Nexus 7 is miles ahead of the competition, as well as my old TF300T. I highly recommend this tablet for anyone, especially the tech-savvy like me. It's small, powerful, and fits my hands perfectly.\n\nBasically, if you're looking for a 7-inch tablet for just about any purpose, your search has ended here :)"}

I was really annoyed with not being able to move the \"recent google play items will appear here\" thing until I found out... I could.  Lawls once I got used to this thing I loved it.\n\nThings I like about the Nexus 7 (2013+ model):\nNo crashing/freezing\nResponsive - Apps populate and screens switch rapidly.\nDesktop Customization - Google has a few things preloaded, but I could move or remove anything I wanted from the home screen.\nDesign - The front is pretty much solid glass, so there is no indentation for the screen like on some ereaders and tablets.  The back has a soft rubberized feel that I personally like.\n\nThings that I didn't like:\nSpeakers - Issued at mid and higher volumes.\nClosing Programs - As I am new to android it was not immediately clear if programs where closing when I went back to home screen or staying up in the background and using resources.  I wish there was more clarity on this, but perhaps there is a task list I have not found yet.  Either way this is more android then Nexus, but in all fairness Nexus is running android... so yeah.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nThe reason I decided to buy the 2013 Nexus 7 is that bases on reviews it appeared some of the other newer, and more expensive tablets tend to hang or freeze while the 2013 Nexus 7 seemed from the reviews to be stable.  I owned two kobo glo's that had this problem and found it frustrating.  I built my own computer and am a bit spoiled when it comes to responsive technology.  In this regard I have not been disappointed by the Nexus 7 at all.  Unless you need the hardware for gaming, or a larger screen size, the Nexus 7 very likely will be all you need or want in a tablet and then some.\n\nBy biggest complaint is that the speakers tend to distort/buzz a little at medium and higher volume levels.  This is very noticeable when playing Netflix movies and often plug in $5 earbuds to \"improve\" the sound experience. I likely have a bad Nexus and plan to talk to a customer service on this soon."}

So i called the customer service and refered to my case opened in June and what i'm told now is that my repair only have 90days warranty so if i want my tablet to be fixed i will have to pay for it ! i find this atttitude unacceptable: Either the repair was poorly done or there is a reccurent issue with such tablet, but in any case ASUS should acknowledge that something is wrong with their support and reliability.\nI will trash this tablet only after a year (and 2 months: i got the message, ASUS that my tablet is joust out of warranty now...) and will buy a Samsung instead. never ASUS again ! poor quality, execrable and stubborn customer service !\n\nPS: an email was sent after the repair to answer a quality survey about my experience, i can't even submit it, the web page is throwing an error !!!"}

I decided to finally break down and buy an android product to give me the apps I want and need, will supplement of existing devices, and to top it off not break the bank.\n\nASUS has always been my go-to tablet and netbook company. It's a perfectly functional tablet, it's sturdy and feels like solid technology without being too heavy. The Nexus 7 is a good weight for reading, casual typing, and surfing the web. This review itself was written using the tablet; the digital keyboard is highly responsive, the screen easily viewable.\n\nThe camera is not incredible; I would reserve the selfies and \"artsy photographer\" photos to actual cameras or phones with powerful cameras, and let the Nexus do quick shots as needed. I have yet to test Skype capabilities.\n\nWe have 2 Nexus 7s in our household, and one of our tablets had issues installing android updates, but that's almost a norm for android to sometimes have bugs.\n\nOverall I'm highly pleased with this tablet. It has the apps I was missing from my life, it has a good screen for Kindle and OverDrive reading apps, and it's a perfect size to be portable yet functional!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJDS", "review": "Quick Update: Had 2 new Nexus 7's come in, and both had quality issues as well...  One had a strong patch of light bleed in the corner, and had grounding issues; The other had pretty strong light bleed around the entire screen, and line bleeding on 1/4 of the screen, visible in darker colors, or darker scenes of videos.  This is just upsetting...  Going to try to see if I can pick the best one of the lot, don't want the accessories to go to waste...\n\nStarting off with the problems:\n\nThe used Nexus 7 I bought that was intended for myself had pretty bad light bleed, a small screen discoloration, and every now and then, a blue pixel or 2 liked to get stuck.  Did not test this tablet any further to figure out any other flaws,  this Nexus 7 is going to be returned.\n\nThe Nexus 7 I bought for my mom as a gift did not have any problems with the screen, besides very little light bleed that would be unnoticable in normal usage, but it has another issue that has cursed a lot of Nexus 7 owners, some might be unaware of this issue on their own Nexus 7  Grounding issues  If you suffer from horrible grounding issue, the Nexus 7 will have a tough time detecting those quick single finger touches if the tablet is on a table, bed, or a case, however if you are holding the tablet in your palms, or have multiple fingers touching it, this issue will go unnoticed.\n\nNow, as of right now, the positives are overshadowed for the Nexus 7, but here they are anyways:\n\nNow, if you don't have any screen defects, this is heck of a display, crisp and clear. The screen resolution of 1920x1080(323 ppi) is great for the price, and works great on a 7 inch tablet, the colors are pretty nice, although, I find the display to be just a touch on the greener side, and sadly, the only way to properly adjust the screen color is being rooted, and running a custom kernel.\n\nThe performance of the tablet is very smooth, after updating it to Android Marshmallow, browsing through apps, web pages, and u.i. was very smooth.  The Snapdragon S4 pro, along with the Adreno 320 should still be plenty of power for those who use the tablet for media consumption, web browsing, and most games, although power might be a little lacking for most recent major app games, but who cares, who does hardcore gaming on a general tablet?\n\nThe build quality and looks of this tablet are really nice, it feels solid in the hands, and doesnt feel like its going to break in your hands.  For the looks, it depends on your taste though, but I think it looks sharp, and simple.  Compared to the original Nexus 7, I felt like this Nexus 7 was not as comfortable to hold, it felt sharper on the edges, and less curved, however, its not as heavy for those long periods of usage.\n\nCommon issues people have had around the web, and other reviews regarding the Nexus 7:\n\nHorrible light bleeding, stuck pixels, grounding issues, multi touch issues, phantom touches, softbricked from OEM software updates.\n\nPersonal opinion:\n\nAs of right now, I have a sour taste with Asus products, and the Nexus program currently.  The original Nexus 7 I have is still carrying on, but those had a good amount of issues as well  Asus has proven that their quality, and control of products have been rocky at best; from tablets, to phones, to GPU aftermarket designs, to motherboards, they make hit and miss products, which is pretty disheartening as they are a major supplier for electronics in the current world.  Hopefully the Nexus 7 in the mail will be free of issues, and make use of the few accessories I have for it, so my mum could have a nice Christmas present...\n\nTLDR: Could be a nice tablet, if it didn't have major issues."}

I first had purchased a cheap $40 7\" tablet here on Amazon and was very disappointed. So I sent it back and bought a new Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite. It was okay but it was a little sluggish. So then I researched more and when I read the specs on the Nexus 7 I just had to try it. I am extremely happy with the speed of the Nexus 7 and the much higher screen resolution. Everything about this tablet is what I wanted from a 7\" tablet. The higher screen resolution allows me to put more app icons on the home screens. The speed rivals what I'm used to on my desktop and laptop computers. Assuming this tablet doesn't die or slow down significantly over time, I'm glad I chose this one."}

The Nexus 7 (2013) is a solid performer with an excellent display. I have had zero issues with it. Some newer tablets in 2015 are coming with slower processors than what this has and 1GB of ram. Stay away from any device with only 1GB of ram! Unless you want a laggy, buggy experience of course.\n\nPros:\nThe 7\" 1920x1200 IPS Display looks Awesome.\nQuad Core Processor with 2GB of ram.\nDual Speakers sound Nice.\nBuilt in WiFi connects to 2.4G OR 5G Networks.\nNice sized battery.\nSimple and minimal design, sleek.\n\nCons:\nBattery life could be a little better.\n\nOther Thoughts:\nI really like this tablet. It is super quick and snappy. I never thought I really had use for a tablet. I currently own a Nexus 6 smartphone. Now that I have the Nexus 7 (2013) my phone gets a break, improving its longevity. When I get home I put my phone down and pick up my Nexus 7. I use to browse around on / use my phone when sitting on the couch and laying in bed. Now, I have a device with a larger display that is much more user friendly due to its size for that. It was worth it in my opinion.\n\nALSO, keep in mind that a lot of these negative reviews are quite old. The Nexus 7 (2013) was known to have various issues with grounding, the touch sensitivity and issues with the display, as well as others. These issues were more so with earlier produced models. The model I received on 11/28/2015 had a manufacture date of 09/2015. I have had ZERO issues and everything works flawlessly!!!"}

The Android 6.0 Marshmallow release on my Nexus 7 (2013) tablet convinced me that I was wrong about that, and that the extra testing and slow, incremental rollouts of updates from my carrier (Verizon) has probably saved my GS5 from the kind of problems that I'm experiencing with the 6.0 Marshmallow release on the Nexus 7. From extreme battery draining issues to the inability to stream any video in any way, it might as well have bricked the device since it has killed most of my reasons to use it. Google seems to think its customers are moving forward at the pace of new-device-adoption it has set, as in \"What? You're still using that tablet from two years ago?

The Nexus 7 is a perfect size and weight for me, I bought a good case for it and can take it everywhere in my purse.  I did not pay for it because it was a gift but did some research and found that it was very affordable.  It does everything an I pad does that I would use, is quick, is small, and has enough space for me to download all of the apps I would ever want.  Would recommend for anyone!"}

The performance of the Gen 2 tablet against my older Gen 1 is like night and day!  I am about to toss my Gen 1 tablet because its performance is awful as the Android versions got updated. Don't buy a Gen 1 no matter what the price! The Gen 2 version is thinner and the bezel is narrower - so the Gen 2 tablet is slightly smaller than the original version. When buying accessories such as covers, be sure to get one for the correct version -- the Gen 2 version has a back camera and the front camera is offset to the right (the front camera on the Gen 1 is in the center of the top bezel)."}

The recent (Nov 2015) Marshmallow operating system update sent out by Google crashed my tablet.  Google's help desk was no help; they could not revive the tablet.  The install had errored out and after that it would not re-boot.  I let the battery totally drain (as recommended by Google) but that did not help.  Even the Factory Reset option failed.  Google referred me to ASUS (the manufacturer) who said there isn't a re-flash option for this model that I could do myself and so if I wanted it fixed, I have to send it to them for repair.  The rep couldn't tell me how much this would cost me.  This is nonsense - Google's software kills my Google tablet and now it's MY responsibility to pay for it's repair??\n\nI had a problem with this Nexus 7 soon after I bought the tablet in 2013.  The camera stopped focusing and I had to mail it to ASUS twice before they eventually repaired the faulty component.  I think ASUS has a quality control problem and the Google/ASUS partnership apparently can't rollout an update without damaging their customer's property."}

We've only had this one 3 months, but so far so good.\nOur old Nexus experience:\nThe first nexus we bought survived my sons' toddlerhood very well!.  My husband bought it two and a half years ago for reading in bed.  Our son had just turned two.  And within days, the boy had claimed it as his own.  In those 2.5 years, my son dropped the tablet upwards of a dozen times a day.  Not exaggerating.  And he's 'a rough' kid too and it only had a cheap case to protecting it.  But eventually, the outdated software caused too many problems with the latest apps, frustrating both our son and me.  So we decided it was time for a new one for our son, who was now 4 and a half years old.  My husband wiped the old Nexus clean and it did help speed it up quite a bit... so it is now perfect for our 18month old daughter, since toddler apps don't require much space or the latest software.  She can't really \"play\" any of the apps yet.  All she really can do at this age is \"color\" on it.... but she's had the old one for three months and beats the ever loving cr*p out of it on a daily basis... and it's still going strong.  There isn't a scratch on the screen.  IDK, I'm just very impressed with Nexus, seeing as how every time one of my adult friends drop their iPhone, I see them ranting on facebook about how it shattered instantly."}

More recently I got my hands on one of as friends and started using it and found that it's actually not bad at all for quick browsing, e-reading, and playing most games. It was good enough that when Newegg and Amazon had a sale on bran dnew ones (which are generally hard to come by) I snapped one up. They are easy to unlock and relatively easy to root, so you can install a custom version of Android and run whatever apps you want if that's your thing, or you can stick with stock Android, and you still get to enjoy the latest Google has to offer as they've released Lollipop for the Nexus 7.\n\nThe only real downside I see is the limited storage space. Having only 16GB means you can't store a lot of larger files, so if you have a lot of apps, use emulators, and/or like to have a lot of music, the Nexus 7 will hamper you a bit."}

I find myself constantly dealing with glitchy interface and lag in transition from apps. The OS is constantly poorly optimized for the tablet.\nMy biggest issue is the cheapness of the screen. This is poorly mentioned by users of the tablet even when i have noticed this within only a couple months of using it. The screen glass is cheap and will break very easily. I don't know how to describe this but some parts of the screen wear off and looks like its peeling, losing its glossyness, leaving splotches of wear all over the screen that look like they can be cleaned off. I decided to write this review because i recently broke my screen but just from carrying it in my pocket. I did not bump it on anything but just simple small pressures in the right areas cracked it. Very weak glass. Also, it was a small crack but the touch screen did not work well anymore to the point that i could not use it at all.\n\nI had very good uses for this tablet and even considering what i disliked about it i still used it almost everyday. The only reason why i have such a problem with it is because of the price and well liking of the public of this tablet. It does not live up to its standards and the price is not considered cheap anymore for this quality. I believe there are much better tablets that could be bought with this price range. Please just don't look at the good reviews of a product, and compare between products yourself to check specific details such as the type of screen glass and the overall wear over time. The overall satisfaction of users will not tell you the issues you might face along the road."}

My son dropped it and put a very small crack in the LCD but yet the tablet still worked.  Eventually the tablet stopped charging.  This is when I contacted ASUS support and they informed me that I could mail the tablet back to their factory to have it fixed since it is still under their one year manufacturers warranty.  They received the tablet and immediately sent me an invoice for $205.00 to repair it.  They said that although it is still under the manufacturers warranty they cannot proceed to fix the charging port because the LCD was cracked.  I disputed the invoice and over and over they told me that they would not fix the charging port until they received payment to fix the LCD.  I explained to them that I did not want the LCD fixed, I only wanted the charge port fixed.  No where in their warranty does it state that they have to fix the LCD prior to fixing a warranted part.  ASUS is terrible with customer service and I now have a tablet that is less than a year old that is worthless.  Not only would they NOT fix the warranted part, but they wanted $205.00 to repair a tablet that only cost $179.00 originally.  I wonder if there are people out there that would actually pay that amount to get a tablet fixed when they could get a new one for less?  I'm not the one!"}

(As a side note, I purchased my wife a Kindle Fire HD 7 at the same time and her's still works great)  The Nexus 7 worked ok for a while and then about a year ago there was a system software upgrade.  It began to run slow, freeze up frequently, wouldn't play videos on some news sites and generally became frustrating to use.  I reviewed the issue, called tech support and of course my warranty was out.  They offered some suggestions and said the best course of action would be to wait for the next system update that would correct many of my issues.  An update did occur but the operation of my tablet never improved and progressively got worse.  I could send it back to the factory and it could potentially cost more that a new one for repairs.  The next phase was when You Tube crashes every time I opened it.  (I thought Google owned You Tube?)  It literally took 10 to 15 minutes for the tablet to go from sleep mode to barely operating every time I tried to use it.\n\nI'm speaking in past tense because now it has become a paperweight.  After charging it a couple days ago, it would not go past the screen saver page.  I tried restarting and it would work for about 10 minutes then blank out.  I even Reset it to factory conditions, hoping maybe I could salvage it.  But alas nothing has helped the paperweight. As I type I'm watching the Tablet try to start but it just keep spinning colored dots over and over again."}

Only time will tell if this unit suffers the same performance fate as the original model (for those not familiar, over time, the first generation tablets tended to quickly slow down and struggle to perform even basic tasks like browsing the internet).

For those, it had worked reasonably well until the battery wouldn't hold charge about 3 days ago (after the 5.1.1 update).  Hoping there is an easy fix, I called product support.\n\n1. I first called Google tech support as it was the number provided on the device.  On a Saturday evening, my call was answered promptly.  Kudos to Google.\n2. The Google rep was courteous.  We spent at least 20 minutes trying to figure out the serials number.  I got the sense the rep didn't believe  the serial number wasn't on the setting page, nor was it on the back of the device.  It turned out, I had to hold both the volume button and the power button down to go to the recovery mode to see the serial # buried in a list of things that made no sense to most common folks.\n3. The google rep then advised me that I had to contact ASUS because the device wasn't bought from Google.\n4. All in all, I spent 10 minutes waiting for ASUS to respond to the call and another one hour to restart the device.  This ASUS tech also didn't believe me when I told him  the serial # wasn't on the back of the device.  To be honest, if I didn't physically look at it, I wouldn't believe  gogole/auss would not put the serial # on the back of the device either.\n5.at the end, both the ASUS tech and me were tired.  He put me on hold, then came back and said I needed to send it in to be fixed.  The estimated cost is $300.  Well, thank you but no thanks.  I can get a new Nexus 7 for $149 on Amazon.  I could get a Nexus 9 for less than $400.  Not to mention the original cost of my Nexus 7 was less than $230  :-)))\n\nUntil the battery charging problem, I was actually thinking about upgrading to Nexus 9.

Long story short, six weeks after purchasing the tablet it is in a non-working state with no way to return it, being outside of the 30 day return policy.

Although this tablet is 2 years old, it's still better picture quality than any new tablet in this price range. (I got this for $149)\n\nIt's a great size for my daughter and she has no issues navigating around it, turning it on and off or with the volume buttons. I'm very happy with this and so is she. Hopefully this will last her a few years."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJDS", "review": "Let me preface this by saying that the Nexus 7, when working, is an OK tablet. The screen image is crisp, it is slick and thin, and the apps load quickly. There are some problems with apps crashing, and the screen is not always responsive to finger touch, however, this is not my main complaint.\n\nI have owned two Nexus 7 tablets over the course of just over two years. I bought the original Nexus 7 tablet for work and after about 6 months I started to have frequent freezes during the boot screen which, according to forums online, was a common problem for many users. I called ASUS since it was still under warranty and, although there was no external damage, they refused to honor the warranty without extravagant repair fees. I found some workarounds online which required forcing a reset on the tablet to get it working again temporarily. Eventually after about 8 more months and several more of these forced resets, the tablet stopped turning on altogether and I decided it was easier to just buy a new one instead of trying to repair the old tablet any longer.\n\nI got the new version of the Nexus 7 in September 2014, about 10 months ago. I use the tablet exclusively at work for reference apps and email and am extremely careful with it as a delicate piece of hardware. At work recently, the screen cracked with NO DAMAGE to the tablet just from carrying it in a loose pocket about 200 feet to my car. Although I did not drop it, bump it, or otherwise cause any significant trauma, there was a crack in the screen which prevented the screen from registering touch any longer. I read online that this has happened to many people besides myself. Again I called ASUS and the customer service was completely unwilling to help and offered an insulting repair cost of $350 for a tablet which I purchased originally for $200.\n\nAlthough the Nexus 7 is a cheap tablet with great specs, there are obviously shortcuts being taken with the integrity of its construction. I will never buy another ASUS tablet again because of their lackadaisical approach to customer service. I would warn people who are considering this tablet that, despite the price, you get what you pay for. These tablets seem built to last 8-12 months, even with minimal use and careful handling."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJDS", "review": "I bought this to essentially replace my old laptop with something smaller and lighter, but still bigger than a smartphone and stronger. For the price, this is a stellar buy. I've been using mine daily at work (I work graveyard shift). It is a fast and reliable device that has respectable battery life, even when running power intensive apps like Hearthstone. It's nicer than my smartphone in that it can switch between apps that are running at the same time very efficiently. The screen is crystal clear, nicer than my Galaxy 3, and worlds nicer than Nintendo 3DS. Perfect for watching Netflix or Crunchyroll or Youtube. I am very impressed by the speakers as well, it can get quite loud and doesn't distort the music by doing so. If you already have an android device and google account, you will be able to get used to using this device in minutes. Mine updated to the latest version of Android right away and I love it.\n\nThe only negative things I can say about it are nitpicks really. I wish the home button was a physical button on the screen that I could press to wake the screen up. When the screen goes dark you only have the lock/power button. Not a big deal, just something I don't care for.\n\nIf you want an affordable tablet that can run most every app, but you don't want to drop 500+ on the latest model, this is an excellent choice."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJDS", "review": "No issues with this until recently and today called ASUS suppprt it is 3 months off warranty. I have been using ASUS products in my computer builds for ages. You would think like other companies I have dealt with in the past they would show appreciation to a loyal customer and stand behind their products only 3 months off 1 year warranty and make an exception and repair but they refused. Heck in the past with other companies they have repaired something off of warranty and I had only bought one thing from them.\n\nQuoted a repair cost of 80 dollars which would be silly to spend on a Nexus 7 repair. Just my opinion but if you are spending more than 50% of the cost to replace an electronic device to repair stop doing that unless it holds some emotional attachment in which case stop getting emotionally attached to your electronics! Buy a new one and have a new warranty and sell the broken or fix it yourself which is what I will probably do.\n\nI then mentioned I am in the planning stages of a new computer build just waiting to see what the release of Skylake does to prices. I asked if they could provide a discount code to one of their vendors and was refused. I really don't think asking a percent off coupon as a show of good will was asking too much given the circumstances and that I am a loyal customer who has bought thousands of dollars of ASUS products in the past and was looking at spending almost another thousand in a new ASUS motherboard and graphics card for next build.\n\nI wanted them to do at least something to keep me as a customer but they would not so I did let them know I will not be buying any further ASUS products. I have not had any major issues with my ASUS computer components and is why I have used them in my past computer builds but this tablet which had issue after 15 months and lack of customer service means I will no longer spend my money with them and recommend to others to look at other manufactures since ASUS doesnt stand behind their products nor appreciate their loyal customers."}

I use chromes remote desktop app to remotely access windows machines when traveling. The screen is perfect, and I couldn't be happier. It is the best purchase I have made in a long time.  I had an uptime of over 4 or so months before I had to reboot it for an OS upgrade, if that tells you anything about stability.\n\nBattery life with normal use reading comic books throughout the day runs about 8 to 12 hours before needing a charge. My only advice is to keep the screen brightness at the lowest acceptable setting to conserve battery life. Turning off bluetooth, and wifi when not being used also help out greatly in conserving battery life. Of course, those things are pretty common knowledge.\n\nGetting a spare portable ankher battery for it when traveling really helps out too if you use the device constantly like I do. I don't mean to sound like i am  criticizing the battery life, I just use this device very heavily. Even though the battery is not user serviceable you can buy a replacement from amazon for like $30 and replace it with a flathead eyeglass screwdriver if your battery ever wears out. (Mine has not.)

Have decreased to 1 star for the following reasons:\n\nI only use this for one application, so cannot comment on most of the google features of this. But with very little use, this product already feels 10 years old.\n\n1) Battery life is so bad the product is virtually useless. Even when turned off it does not retain charge for a day\n2) Constant autoupdating of bloatware uses up memory, battery.\n3) Painfully slow rponse within aps. Lots of crashing.\n\nReturning it and trying Samsung next.\n\n*******\n\nWe purchased this device because we needed something running Android for data collection tools we are developing at work. It definitely meets those needs, despite many annoying errors when you need to have multiple users and accounts linked to one device.\n\nWe also have an IPad, so I'll leave a couple comments for those folks who might be wondering which to buy for home use.  I find the IPad much more user friendly, and less cluttered with aps you'll never use. Settings are not easy to navigate on the nexus, and it's especially hard to find those settings Which place some limits on the data Google collects and stores on your internet usage. If you need secure email, I'm not sure this device is a good choice as it probably opens your other (non gmail) accounts to goggle data mining if you route through their gmail Ap, but I'm just assuming this. Same for storage of things on their cloud (Google drive), so read their privacy policies carefully if you are using this for work and be careful what you enable on the device. The IPad is miles ahead with regard to screen resolution and camera. I only use this for work, so have not tried out any of the steaming services, third party aps, etc, so cannot comment on those.  Buttons (on/off and volume) are somewhat hard to press, and become more difficult when the device is placed in a case. Downloading updates and installing seemed really slow compared to IOS. Overall,  this device seems quite clunky in comparison to the IPad."}

Except... it freezes and restarts between five and fifty times a day - no warning, no (observable) reason - it just stops.\n\nI've tried everything to get it to stop that. I've reset it to factory settings/etc., I've deleted all apps, I've tried using it with only one app open... and it still freezes and restarts. For anyone who might think I must be using some crazy app that's taking up memory/processing space: the app I have open most often when it freezes is either Google's HangOut or Google's gDocs. For a day or two, I thought maybe interaction with my home wi-fi was the issue, but then this morning it was on my office wi-fi and it froze and restarted.\n\nI've Googled the issue, but Google itself seems to be of no help. The search brings up forums where folks discuss this issue and, like me, they've tried everything (those forums are where I learned how to reset to factory settings, stop it from automatically downloading app upgrades, etc.). The consensus on the forums seems to be that the 16GB version of the Nexus has a hardware issue that causes this. Not every single one of the version - just random individual devices have the problem. I got a dud, it seems.\n\nI'm returning it to Amazon - they've said they'll issue a full refund. So, here's hoping! I'm unsure whether I'm going to risk going with another 32GB Nexus 7 or move on to some other maker's tablet.\n\nThis device, though, has just been so disappointing."}

I first worked on my 2012 model and after some issue using the flashall.bat, I was able to get it restored to 4.4.4.  So I then started on my 2013 model. After a whole day of trying to get it to boot using 4.4.4, I was about to give up when I found an article that said there is an issue with certain models recently manufactured and the boot.img which prevents it from being restored to 4.4.4.  There is hacked fix for this, but it is not certified, so I did not want to use it. So I went back to the official Google site that has the factory images and noticed there was a brand new 5.1.1. image. I was able to get my 2013 tablet restored to it.  Now the strangest thing is so far the 2013 tablet has not reboot or frozen since restored to the new 5.1.1 image.  A couple times on a few sites Chrome would start to freeze, but then after a second or two would continue.  All that said and reported there still seems to be a very huge issue with Nexus 2013 tablets and Android 5. XX.  Just do a search for Nexus 7 2013 bricked and read all of the posts.\n\nThe design is great and the features are great, but with Android 5.xx it is useless. The tablet freezes several times a day and reboots even if it is just sitting there with no app active. I ordered this one expecting it would come with Android 4.4, because my 2012 one became useless when upgraded to Android 5.0.  This 2013 version came with Android 5.0 and immediately wanted to upgrade to 5.1.  I gave it a try and sure enough it started freezing up and rebooting as well.  I have tried the clear cache routine several times and also remove any app that is not ready for Android 5.0. One of the apps that freezes more than any is Chrome.\n\nAlso had problems with the GPS which I did not have with the 2012 version.  I have the Samsung S4 smartphone which now wants to be upgraded to Android 5.0 which is not going to happen if I can help it."}

Nexus offers NO customer service. I am in communication with about 100 Nexus users, having the same issue, through their customer support blog. Some have even tried to go back to the retailer that they made the original purchase only to find the cost to even submit it for repair averages $200 and there's no guarantee it can be fixed.\n\nThe customer service for Nexus Tablets is disappointing to say the least, so before you buy any Nexus product, keep in mind the parts warranty is for 1 year and if you have a problem with your Nexus product after that, you're pretty much at a loss, or as one of the users says, it becomes an expensive paperweight.\n\nIt has been the most disappointing purchases I've made after being so happy with my Nexus 7 Tablet for almost 2 years.\n\nAfter checking with Office Depot and Best Buy for repair options, Office Depot informed me they are no longer offering Nexus products due to issues with the tablet and Best Buy recommended \"ANY TABLET, BEFORE CONSIDERING A NEXUS TABLET\"."}

We have three of these (one for each kid) and so far we have sent back one of them 3 times for the charging port and the other one 2 times for the charging port. The third one is great. No problems after a year and a half. If you need to return it for warranty repairs they do not cover shipping. You must pay to ship and insure it yourself. Also, after the repair you have 3 months warranty and then it is over. One of ours went back and they lost it. It took well over a month to get it back. Then the charging port broke 3 1/2 months after we got it back and they refused to cover it. So, again, I have sent it back and now I wait for them to repair it and I have to pay for the repair myself. So, my best advice is to buy this device but also buy a QI compatible wireless charger for it. Then I can give it 5 stars."}

I have had it for over six months and severely disappointed in this tablet. The amount of time takes to load up on games is absured and while it is doing so I hope it doesn't crash, if I am lucky only the game crashes, if not,  the system UI will too. Sometimes the tablet just gives up and restarts. Chrome is extremely risky to use, it lags, crashes, or just doesn't load up. Safest bet to avoid this is to close all tabs before closing out chrome to avoid this issue on next browsing session, but it doesn't always work. I think one of the biggest problems some of this occurs from is from overheating.  I can feel the tablet get hot from the outside, can't imagine how hot on the inside. I have a tablet I bought four or so years ago, a Samsung one, and it is more reliable than my Nexus. Games run smoother,  don't crash, and I have the same games as the Nexus. Also the brower runs as expected.  I had hope for a good tablet replacement,  expected better from Asus and Google, still use it, but sometimes I am tempted give it a \"fax machine\" treatment.  Have tried a few things to get it to operate better but to no avail."}

My experience with the tablet and ASUS has been anything but positive.  I will say that the tablet worked fine for all of 6 months!  At that time the cheap charging port broke on the tablet.  I had the exact same thing happen on a $60 Coby tablet I had bought years earlier.  I thought for the extra money I was buying something constructed better - obviously I was mistaken.  So I thought no problem I will send it to ASUS and they can repair the charging port under warranty.  After getting the run around for a couple of weeks they tell me that the battery, some board in the tablet, and the charging port are all bad and they can repair it for $75.  Said none of it is covered due to customer caused damage!  First, the tablet had never been dropped and second when is the last time a drop would break a battery?  This is a real clever trick to just make everything out to be customer caused damage and they never have to take responsibility for their cheaply made tablet.  If you can guarantee that nothing is going to break it might be worth the chance otherwise I would steer clear of this product."}

Nexus said that along with Google, they had nothing to do with the manufacturing of this product, even though there name was clearly imprinted on the back.\nThey gave me the number to ASUS who is the actual manufacturer.  After doing some trouble shooting, ASUS determined that I was having the same issue others Nexus 7 Tablet users were having.

After learning this, I went back to the big box retailer I purchased it from and learned that sending it in was my only option. They offered to pay for the shipping however the cost of the new motherboard was up to me.  I asked how they knew it was the motherboard, I was told,  \"that's usually the problems with that tablet.  He couldn't count how many they had to send back and of course when they called the customer to tell them the approximate cost of the repair,  he didn't know of a single customer that accepted that.\nOf course I said no.

If I didn't know something (which is often because I'm not tech savy at all) I could easily google what I needed to do and there was a lot of great information that helped me out.  I am only giving it 4 stars rather than 5 because the first step towards set up is connecting to the internet.

As this is now my issue (and a near wasted $180), I would just point out to ASUS/Google:\n- My $30 music player has expandable storage - really how much did this save the company, $3?\n- Now I can't use this for a library of music and movies - Aps will eat the 10GB quickly.\n\nLesson learned: Yup, got to get a new pair of glasses... oh and don't buy a Nexus!"}

I have used it in my CEH courses as well as for forensics, watching moves and games and it is really good to use.\n\nThe only things I can see improving on are the keyboard (hands are too big) and the buttons."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJDS", "review": "Probably one of the finest computers ever made.  A pity they discontinued it.  It has blinding speed, and an incredibly dense screen (1920 x 1200 resolution and 323 ppi pixel density).  THE BEST part of it is that it apparently has 12 GB for apps, not just 2 GB as you would think since its RAM is only 2 GB!  THERE IS A LOT of nonsense on the Web about how the lack of an SD card is a problem.  It isn't.  You just substitute a flash drive.  You just plug the tablet into a PC through the USB micro to USB cord supplied, and you can connect to the flash drive through the PC!  (Or you can just use the PC for extra storage.)  The critics also complain of the camera's poor light sensitivity.  Actually, you can use the \"Fill Light\" function in Picasa or other photo editor to adjust the light level after the fact.  As to the supposedly grainy texture of the photos from the rear camera, I suppose that is the case, based on limited testing.  However, I independently bought a $25 camera that is as good as any tablet camera out there.  Therefore I don't mind.  Yet another good point is that it charges while it is connected to the USB on your PC.  (Many tablets don't.)  The only thing I have not liked so far after using it for about 4 days is that the cord, which is used for charging and for USB connection, is flimsy.  Mine lasted only 4 days.  A replacement, USB A male to micro USB B male, is a standard type, and can be bought inexpensively.  If you don't trust your cord, it is a good idea to keep a replacement cord handy."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJDS", "review": "I originally got the 1st generation of this tablet as a present back in 2012 as a gift, and loved it. However as newer version came out and new updates were added my old 1st gen outdated tablet had more and more issues. I did some shopping around as well as inquiring of others who I know personally about the tablets they own. The only one that seemed to come close in my opinion was the Kindle Fire and yet my co-worker had SO many issues with his I decided to play it safe and get the newer upgraded version of my Nexus 7. I like the new slightly thinner, yet longer model, though I did have to buy new cases as the older 1st gen cases do not fit on this new model. Some of the functions I did not like on the original they have updated and fixed, such as putting speakers on both ends instead of one in the back, as I felt like my 1st gen model was always too quiet. It is definitely more sleek and less bulky too which is nice. Not only does it do the exact same things that you would be able to do on an IPAD, but it is MUCH cheaper too! I am so glad I did! I love this tablet. And even though I bought mine used I have had no issues with it. As this model eventually becomes outdated I will probably upgrade to the new verson of this same tablet again if I have the chance. I definitely recommend it to anyone!"}

It works great and is convenient when a laptop is too cumbersome and heavy and  is also nice to have since I don't have/need a smart phone.\n\nThe tablet edges are ridged though, not flat, and are uncomfortable on my fingers, but I bought a case for it which is smoother.  The case also makes a stand for watching shows and movies. The picture is so very crisp and beautiful.\n\nI have dropped this tablet or it has fallen (on the carpet) many times but nothing has happened so far, it still works well.  The screen is scratch resistant which I didn't know before I bought it so I have a package of screen protectors lying around I have never used.\n\nSince the tablet is from Google it is very convenient to use with a google account and everything works together.  It comes with an email app that allows me to have all my email accounts on one app.\n\nI find for my needs there is plenty of storage space with 16 GB.  At one point I had installed more apps than were necessary or than I was actually using and had to uninstall some of them and delete some unimportant downloads so there was enough space for the OS to upgrade to a higher version, and it was no big deal.\n\nThe only thing is I wish the camera had zoom, or if it does I haven't been able to find it, and it seems like I am needing it all the time (I don't have a regular camera).  The camera can take panoramas though and also has a neat feature called photo sphere that can take a 360 degree picture you can then view as a video.  Pretty cool.  I haven't been able to find out how to share it with anyone though.\n\nI use this tablet quite a lot for many things everyday and am real happy with it.\n\nUpdate:  Well, I figured out how to zoom when using the camera.  Just have to stretch the screen like when you zoom a webpage and pinch again to pan back.  Still learning, ha."}

I was well within the warranty period, so I contacted ASUS to see what they could do. They basically told me that if the screen breaks, they automatically assume that it's your fault, and won't repair it unless you pay in full.

Google's reason given is the instability of Flash player. No options are given. That \"problem\" was not given in the specs details; doesn't stop other companies from using the Flash player! Also, BTW, recently Google has stopped supporting YouTube on devices older than 2013. So if, for example you have a Sony blue-ray player, 2012 or older, your SOL.

So far, they all seemed to be wrong.\n\nAfter powering up and connecting to Wi-Fi, I was prompted to upgrade to Lollipop 5.0 which was a slow process, but seemed to work okay.  When using basic functions like looking at Facebook or websites, the device would  regularly freeze up and sometimes reboot itself.  Other times it would also freeze up for over a minute and do nothing.  I pressed and held down the power button, and it then rebooted, so I'm not sure if that was from me holding down the power button or if it just happened itself.  One of my IT friends suggested that I needed to upgrade to Lollipop 5.1.  That night the tablet prompted me to do so.  Unfortunately, after the upgrade, the tablet still had the freezing issues at least once or twice a day -- and I only use it for an hour or so each day.\n\nAlso on one hand, I like the compact size and light weight, but on the other hand the device seems very flimsy and cheap.\n\nAt this point, I am still pretty disappointed and will likely return it through Amazon."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJDS", "review": "I've only had this tablet for a week, but I'm already in love with it. I had a Kindle Fire previously, and it stopped working after less than 2 years (charging port issue). After reading reviews on the newer Kindles, I decided they were too glitchy so I opted for the Nexus 7 (2013). I was able to download my Kindle Reading App, and also all of my games I had on my Kindle with the Kindle Store app. I can do so much more with this tablet than I ever could with my Kindle, and for the price, it's amazing how much it does."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJDS", "review": "This is my third Nexus 7, the first was great but I wanted the, 2013 refresh, which I used every day for a year and a half till the battery would not hold a charge. I looked at the competition in this price range, but it far well below what the Nexus 7 offered, so I bought my third. I would recommend buying one soon, since Google has replaced it with the Nexus 9,which seems to be an inferior device, and the 7 is being discontinued. Buy one today before they're gone for good."}

They are easy to use, work well, have decent battery life, and are decently portable. I have had no issues with these tablets working in very harsh conditions - so they do have a bit of ruggedness to them, and the price point is very good despite being a bit older product overall."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJDS", "review": "I love this tablet! I got it as a Christmas gift in 2013 and immediately started personalizing the background and icons with LineDeco. I downloaded several apps (44 right now!) for work and play and they work great with no low-storage problem- good since this tablet doesn't have a microsd slot.  Netflix looks fine to me and I like that I can cast the entire screen to my tv direct from the drop down menu.  The size is perfect for ebooks- even my small hands can hold it one-handed, as long as the case is off.  The camera takes great pictures.\n\nI have had trouble with the touchscreen sensitivity where the tablet doesn't always register my swiping, but that could just be me.  About year 3 the charging port stopped working but I bought a wireless charging pad and that has worked fairly well although not with the case on and it sometimes loses 'connection' when I'm charging overnight and it won't be fully charged in the morning.. Now I'm in year 5 and the tablet is definitely showing it's age (although so am I!). It lags when switching between apps and is slow loading updates on Facebook.  Occasionally it will freeze completely and then restart itself.\n\nWish Google had kept this line going! I tried Samsung Galaxy Tab A 7 and it was not worthy. Now I'm looking for something decent to replace this guy."}
