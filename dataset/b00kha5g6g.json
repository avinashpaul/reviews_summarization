Battery life (and charging) is not as good as iPad or for that matter, for a device that costs 500 bucks. A few issues with Android as well (but then I have my own gripes with IOS as well). The microSD slot was hard to use. I use a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Transcend-32GB-MicroSDHC-Class10-UHS-1-Memory-Card-with-Adapter-45-MB-s-TS32GUSDU1E/dp/B00CES44EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Transcend 32GB MicroSDHC Class10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter 45 MB/s (TS32GUSDU1E)</a>, but it is quite difficult to insert and keep it locked; had to use a tool (I used the microsd adapter!) to push the card in. This card does get recognized and I can use it well.\n\nOld Review:\nMy iPad 2 broke and I was looking to buy an (a second one in the household) ipad air; got this at the right time, and am in tablet heaven...\nI did try a Dell Venue 8\" - my first android tab - a while ago and it was a disaster (turns out there are display and hardware issues with that model). So when I got this, I was a bit skeptical - only for the first 10 minutes, though!\nLet us get to details then...\nSummary of differences with ipad:\n1. MicroSD slot! (up to 128Gb capacity)\n2. Better and bigger display\n3. 3GB memory for running applications (compared to 1GB)\n4. Camera 8MP compared to 5MP\n5. Fingerprint sensor!\n\nSize and handling: At 10.5, it is bigger than ipad air. Even thinner than iPad at 0.26 inches; smooth surfaces, and as with iPad Air, it is a bad idea to handle this beauty without a case; it is quite easy to drop these, and they are not made to hold in hand for long hours without a cover, either. So, please buy a good cover to go with this.\n\nDisplay: At 2560x1600 it is about 25+% more than iPad air in terms of resolution (287ppi compared to 264ppi) - and it shows! Beautiful Super AMOLED display beats out the LED displays. It is reported that AMOLED displays are usually not bright enough, but on this model, it is more than enough - even in bright outdoors. The settings entry for brightness has an 'auto' mode, but that doesn't seem to work fully well (an android issue or Samsung issue), and it is still bright in the night. I had to turn off auto and reduce the brightness manuallly for night time viewing! The display is gorgeous, to say the least, and the best part of this tablet.\n\nBattery and charging: Battery life is quite adequate at about 8+ hours ( I did run through several episodes of burn notice with netflix streaming on one charge). Charging with the included charger does take longer than I expected - several hours for full charge. In addition, there is ultra power saving mode you can turn on from 'settings -> General' menu - this mode takes you to a black and white screen mode and allows basic web surfing, email and a few application that you can choose to add.  In this mode, it can last quite a few hours with just 10% charge remaining.\n\nBloatware: Contrary to some review, there is some bloatware that is pre-installed but not much. There are two boxes that show up in the second screen - Galaxy essentials and galaxy gifts. If you go in to this, you get to choose what bloatware you want :) But there are some good ones such as wall street journal or Economist 3 month subscriptions for free, GQ and other free issues, as well as some free games.\nThere are 2 apps - Samsung Level (for the soon-to-be-released Samsung headphones - to compete with Beats..) and Samsung Gear - pre-installed.\n\nCamera: 8MP for the back camera with a flash compared to just 5 MP in iPad - seems good. But this is the only feature that was ordinary in Samsung tablet. The pictures in auto mode doesn't look as good as a normal (cheapo) 8MP digital camera photos in auto mode - even to an untrained eye. (I put a Canon EOS 7D to good use and I can spot a good camera when I see one; sadly this is not one of those..), but it is adequate; so is the front camera at 2 MP.\n\nWIFI - comparable; both support a/b/g/n dual band MIMO, but Samsung also supports 'ac'. Quite easy to setup/connect to home networks. So far there is not one hiccup with the wireless access. Excellent performance.\n\nCPU - While iPad only has A7 ARM cores, Samsung has 4 A7 cores and 4 A15 cores; it claims it switches the cores depending on the need/usage/power requirements. For all practical purposes, it is fast; there is some lag but not serious lag in using multiple apps and notifications and background tasks going on.\n\nFingerprint sensor: It is all how you train (give samples) the sensor! It takes 8 samples to setup, and so use your finger in slightly different angles - tilting your finger a little from left to right before each sample. Settings screen and fingerprint setup also allows you to setup an alternate password in case you can't get through with your fingerprint. In addition you can always unlock with your google account. I am able to use the finger sensor almost without any failure so far and found this this to be way better than the one I have on my Dell Lattitude notebooks.\n\nAudio: has 2 speakers one on each side (unlike ipad air), and the audio is decent for this price, though I prefer to use earbuds for better sound.\n\nWatch On app and the IR capability: while new for Samsung, the app is still not ready; has several issues. It let me add my Denon receiver, dish receiver, sony bluray and panasonic tv etc., but I can't turn off or control all devices individually (no selection for device). Only volume, channel change etc work! Power button asks what device you want to power off - again didn't list bluray or receiver - only my TV and Dish. I hope this will get fixed as the app improves. But basic IR facility is great - worked from a distance of 20+ ft across the room.\n\nI absolutely love this. In terms of hardware, it scores a 10/10; fit and finish is great and I would expect this to last at least another 6 to 8 years (unless the technology obsoletes this hardware - which it will...); Apple has been trounced from the tablet throne with this entry."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "For that and this is my toy that lets me do what I want.  I or my wife own I pads and Kindle HD and a galaxy tab pro and nothing beats the pleasure of watching movies on this (for a tablet-not that 60 inch curved tv at Magnolia). There is detail and depth and color. I use any content apps I want- Hulu, Netflix, Xfinity, it looks fantastic.  Amazon prime music app now let's you listen and download for offline listening if you have prime. I don't believe that prime video is supported on this device or any Android tablet. Not through a nonexistent app or the Chrome browser.\n  The micro SD slot is important to me if I'm looking at photos I take with a separate camera and don't wish to use a computer to put them onto the cloud just to see them or jump through other hoops  or hurdles to look at my content.\n\n  Speaking of pictures I worried that this display would over saturate the ones I took and give me a false representation or candy colors. I like to see how I'm doing on a larger screen and take a tablet along with me frequently and Samsung uses an adaptive display for your various content that tones things down depending on what your doing.  My photos look pretty  natural, but  very detailed.  I love this thing for a lot of reasons. There are plenty of things to customize and make your own. It will have been a good purchase."}

I had the very 1st generation iPad, but other than that I've never had a tablet before.\n\nThe first thing you notice when you turn on the tablet and play the sample video clip that comes on the tablet is how astonishing the screen brightness and clarity is! The video is so crisp and clear.  I was going to buy the Note 10.1 refurbished model because it was hundreds cheaper, but when I found out this tablet is Super Amoled display and all the tech sites said this is the best tablet on the market right now, I decided to fork up the extra money and get it. I'm sure glad I did!\n\nI showed my friend at work who has an iPad, and the first thing he said \"that blows my iPad out of the water!\"\n\nThe finger scanner works flawlessly! The tablet asks you to scan your finger 8 times, and I've never had it fail me once and I've unlocked the screen 30+ times today.\n\nThe bezel around the screen is the smallest we've seen yet in a tablet and I love it! For instance, if you compare this tablet to the Nexus 10, the Nexus 10 looks so outdated because of the THICK bezel going around the edge of the tablet. You do NOT get that unappealing look with this tablet. This tablet is the sexiest one on the market right now!\n\nSamsung, I love you!!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "This is basically the first electronic item I've ever bought day one. I've had my smartphone for 3 years now and that was the first one I ever bought. I didn't get my first tablet until last year. This gives you an idea about how excited I was to buy this tablet. I was ready for an upgrade when Samsung announced this was coming and I preordered the same day. I've played around with for about 8 hours now and falling even deeper in love with it. I'll go over a few of the pros and cons I've found so far.\n\nPro:\nThe screen. In only word I can think to describe it is perfection. It is flat out amazes and there isn't a product on the market that can stand up to it. Anything you compare it to will come out lacking.\n\nSize. Big 10.5 inch screen but weighs less than many paperback books. Easy to hold in one hand. Thinner than it has any right to be.\n\nThe UI. I have a custom interface on my phone and older tablet. I don't feel the need to replace the Samsung UI. Feels smooth, feels right.\n\nPerformance. No slowdowns, no stuttering, no lag. Apps open instantly, switch instantly. Everything flows flawlessly. Nothing I threw at it slowed it down. It was easily able to play full HD movies while I switched back and forth between the movie, chrome, and even word documents.\n\nCons:\n\nBattery. Takes a lot longer to charge than I would expect for a device that came out in 2014 with a price tag the Tab S commands. And for how long it takes to charge the battery should hold a charge much longer. Watching a movie the battery didn't seem to budge, but if I spent a couple hours browsing the web it seemed like I could watch the battery drain.\n\nSize. I know I put this under pro and it really is, but there is a negative side to how thin it is. I don't have a cover for it right now and maybe it's my hands but it feels like it could slip right out of my grip at any moment. I will feel a lot less nervous once I get a cover for it. This is more of a personal thing.\n\nIf I was going to use this only for business where I might be away from a charger for long extended periods at a time this wouldn't be the tablet for me.  But I plan to use this for a mix of business and entertainment and will never be more than 5 or 6 hours away from a charger. For anyone who wants a premium tablet experience this is the way to go. You'll be drooling over the screen just like I still am."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "Let's review the specs.  For $500 you get a 10.5 inch screen, ultra thin body with high resolution screen, a stated 9 hour battery runtime, around 10 ounces in weight and 3GB RAM.\n\nThe new iPad?  Nope, it's the new entry from Samsung, the Galaxy Tab S 10.5.\n\nBut let's be realistic -- it's designed to compete with the iPad in an attempt to topple the latter from its throne so comparisons must be made in that respect.\n\nAs compared to the iPad Air, this unit has a slightly larger screen and maybe weighs a bit more, but otherwise they are nearly identical in these areas.  Both also sport robust construction although a few I know that compared this to the iPad state the Apple version has the sleek aluminum structure; however, there is no faulting the Samsung.\n\nUnfortunately, both do share a similar trait -- forgo a case and you also forgo grip.  Both are so light and thin they are literally a drop accident waiting to happen.\n\nAnd while both tip the financial scales at identical pricing, the Samsung has a few upgrades.  First, you get 3GB RAM instead of the usual 1 for the iPad, then you'll notice the rear camera has a flash and an 8MP rating as opposed to the lower resolution iPad version (with no flash), and, finally, you get a micro-SD card slot (something Apple has been ignoring for years).\n\nHowever, it's the screen that will amaze.  AMOLED technology means colors are bright and blacks are, well, eerily black (almost new car, shiny black).  This is quite a contrast from the iPad's more sedate screen, although both are still amazing considering the technology from the earlier tablets, but the truth remains that side-by-side, the Samsung's screen really stands out.\n\nIn fact, after a short while I had to tone down the brightness some as this unit will actually light up a room.  Nighttime discreet is not in the cards here.\n\nPerformance-wise the Samsung gets the newer Android 4.4 OS which has a bevy of improvements over previous versions, too many to mention here.  Let it suffice to say that speed is not a problem here and I enjoy the interface over iOS versions which don't allow main screen widgets and much in the way of related animations.  In short, if you desire an OS that allows for streaming news and interactive widgets, this is the puppy for you.\n\nHowever, there are some quirks here.  Android allows for folders to be created on the screen to house multiple apps and this is done by either moving apps on top of each other (ala' Apple) which creates a new folder or by holding a finger on the screen to bring up a submenu to create a folder; however, Samsung tweaked this procedure and has made it so the only way to create desktop folders is by holding an icon until a menu appears on top of the screen and then scooting the icon to that area to create a folder.  Time consuming and somewhat unnecessary.\n\nSamsung added one perk to the mix, though -- a fingerprint scanner.  Swipe your fingerprint at the center bottom of the screen when prompted and it'll open the  OS as if you entered a password (word of caution -- remember the password in case your finger doesn't pass muster).  Although initially impressed, it some became apparent it had about a 40% success rate and is not for the impatient since it requires a slow, methodical swiping of the finger.\n\nSound reproduction is an ongoing problem with any tablet unless you opt for the headphones but Samsung hit it here.  Sound reproduction is great.\n\nPerformance, unfortunately, does come at a cost, though.  Although rated at 9 hours of battery life (down from an original estimate by some of closer to 11), those ignoring the battery saver functions built in will find themselves seeking an outlet at closer to 7, as in my case.  To be fair, I was running videos and jumping all over the internet so your mileage may vary.  For those that sometimes ignore the battery warnings, there is a power mode that turns the screen from color to B&W and shuts down all but the essential apps.  Hopefully you don't have to use this mode much since you're getting down to the critical stage by that time but you can technically turn it on any time.\n\nOn that power topic, I really couldn't find much that would cause this unit to lock up or slow down.  Even higher end, memory eating, games didn't seem to bother it much nor did forgetting to shut down the last 15 apps I opened while hammering away at another.  Guess that 3GB RAM does help a lot.\n\nSo, are there any downsides here?  As with any tablet, including the vaunted iPad, there are faults:\n\n* Price is steep and encroaches on Apple territory.  Given the option of the Apple or Samsung at the same price, the vast majority chose the former.\n\n* Accessories?  What accessories? Few companies are producing cases and the like at this time and you can easily dump anywhere from $40 on up at Samsung's site to get cases which, oddly enough, seem to be lagging behind the release date of the tablet itself (although I may has misread that).  Because of the odd screen size (larger than the industry standard of 10.1\") you chance of making one of these fit into a generic tablet holder is about nil.\n\n* No 4G (or 3G for that matter) yet and capable models will not be out until later this year.  Oops, that's a biggie.\n\n* 16GB for main memory?  Really?  Yes, the Samsung does have a card slot that can accept up to 128GB, but not everything transfers to these cards (especially some apps) and transfer rates from these cards are still slower than the included drive.  Offer options here, folks.\n\n* Bloatware galore, and gimmicky stuff at that.  Fortunately, most of it just sits there and does nothing until you command differently; however, I was hoping those days were gone when tablets came out.  Problem is, some of that 16GB onboard is occupied with this stuff but I do have to commend Samsung for leaving what appears to be the majority on their website for download if desired.\n\nAnd, finally, there is the processor.  Instead of opting for the Intel Atom tablet series, Samsung opted to stay with the newest Enyxos quadcore version.  While wholly capable and probably just as appropriate as the Atom, the Intel name does carry cache over what was chosen.\n\nHowever, all things considered, Samsung could have a hit here, especially with those users not quite accustomed to Apple's version of \"take it or leave it\" iOS and lack of SD card support.  For the same price as a base Apple unit, Samsung buyers get more RAM, an SD card reader, the Android OS, and cameras with flash and better MP ratings.\n\nUpdate:  There have been a couple pesky little items that have cropped up that don't necessarily merit a drop in rating but should be kept in mind:\n\n*  The charger is just as bad as the old Apple iPad pre-Lightning version; however, it's even smaller and more fragile.  Mine is already starting to show signs of fatigue and there's no way of gingerly putting one in.  I can see this as an accident waiting to happen.\n\n*  Email notification is nothing short of lacking.  I have it on push yet this model is always behind my Apple  by at least a good couple minutes.  In addition, I'll delete an email only to have it suddenly reappear in my inbox.  Hmmm, something isn't right here.  Had to finally ignore the installed Samsung app and put in another."}

The battery was replaced recently and it works like brand new. I installed a 128GM SD Card and realized it was almost useless if you don know how.\nFirst the USB C power plug is a weak, point and many people replaced it and the circuit, by opening the tablet.\nSo the first thing I installed a right leg USB C male to USB A female, and I plug the power, or USB memory stick at USB A female. If anything goes wrong I have to replace this $7 adaptor without touching the tablet.\nSecond - The volume of tablet is low, but I accept and understand why. Samsung is able to put 3 WAT Speakers, but this will drain the battery in 2 hours.\nso for personal use I bought a \"Edifier H180 Hi-Fi Stereo Earbuds Headphone - Classic Earbud Style Headphones - Black\" for about $13.\nIf 2 or more people need to listen I bought a \"TIVDIO L-218 Portable AM/FM Transistor Radio with Mp3 Music Player Speaker Support Micro IF Card (Gold)\" for about $13 ( with very clear sound).\nYou can stream at TV in your home too. So the volume isn't an ISSUE if you KNO HOW.\nRegarding the software, unfortunately there are limitations, and to overcome them it is beyond of general Public.\nTo give step by step everything I have to Write A 100 pages book but here are some tips.\nTo use efficiently all 128GB external memory it was easy to say, but hard to accomplish.\nIt isn't so simple because:\nApp Manager III works much better if your tablet is rooted. I was finally able to root my Samsung tablet after many...  many attempts. Anyone who says rooting your tablet is a piece of cake then is not a beginner. You have to have some experience. Experience is gained by failing. I was worried about bricking my tablet.\nSo after rooting my tablet the first thing I did is Grant app manager III Super user access, which you can only Grant if you have rooted your tablet.\nAnd this is the first step, but you have to make more steps to be able to use efficiently the 128GB SD CARD storage.\nBut did you got AOSP (Android Open Source Project) 6.0.1 ROM, as I did on my SM-T800, and that let's you format your micro SD card as internal storage.\noh there are more things to do, and unfortunately, Samsung doesn't provide you much detailed information.\nIf you are using a 128GB SD Card, as Ii do, did you partitioned your SD Card?\nYou backup your files to the pc. After you have partitioned your SD Card, put the files back on it. When you insert the card back in it will ask you which script, ext. 2, 3 ,4 etc.. Then you can link apps to the system partitions.\noh did you installed link2sd?\nThe potential is as big, as the time and pain, to make it working properly."}

Other uses, such as browsing websites or simply reading online or downloaded books, manga, comics, etc. does not work as well due the unfortunate placement of the capacitive buttons. You simply cannot hold this tablet in vertical format without accidentally hitting the capacitive buttons, whether your are right or left handed. I did a web search on this issue and found a vid explaining how to install \"soft\" buttons (which are the typical back, home, and recent apps buttons) wherever you want on the screen and then using another app to disable the capacitive buttons. having done this allows me to use the tablet in a vertical format so I can now read all the books, manga, and comics I want without accidentally activating the wrong button just by holding the tablet in a comfortable way.\nI bought this tablet to replace my trusty Xperia Z2 which has those buttons on the short side. It actually did not even occur to me that the new tablet would need apps to allow me to continue holding the tablet vertically without always hitting the wrong button."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "First and foremost, I will say right off the bat that if you are considering this tablet, absolutely find a used or refurbished one. For the near $500 price tag of a brand new Galaxy Tab S, you can find a better device to suit your needs. That being said, this is a great choice for anyone who is not a power user. I am a college student who simply wanted a lightweight device for media consumption and productivity purposes, and this device suits my needs very well.\n\nThe device is decently fast, although there can be some noticeable sluggishness at times. I have never been a fan of the Samsung user experience, and my distaste is reinforced in this device. I opted to use Nova Launcher over Samsung's Touchwiz skin in order to obtain a cleaner user experience. Touchwiz is a notoriously heavy Android skin, and this device is riddled with Samsung \"improvements\" (which include a variety of Samsung apps that cannot be disabled, which is slightly irritating).\n\nThere are many good things to say about this tablet as well. Samsung makes some of the most amazing screens for mobile devices, and this one is no exception. It is incredibly bright, crisp, and vibrant. In addition the tablet is fantastically sleek. Even with a keyboard case attached, the combined thickness that of your average magazine. The tablet feels premium in its build, and features such as the fingerprint sensor make the user experience much more enjoyable.\n\nAll other things aside, this tablet has become my daily driver. I would highly recommend this product for a casual user who is looking for a partner for their laptop, or simply a larger screen than their phone to watch Netflix."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "(This review has an update at bottom)\n\nMy one-star rating evaluates the overall product experience:  purchase, use and reliability.  The irony?  The tablet is the best I've seen.  There aren't enough adjectives.  Clear, bright, versatile, flexible, long battery life, and stylish.\n\nThe worst part of my wife's tablet became clear when the device wouldn't charge fully to 100% in less than 36 hours after about 150 charges, a relatively short use of battery.  I purchased this for my her and ignored her when she complained about long charge times after just three months of use.  After the warranty expired, and she kept complaining the charges were taking longer, I ran tests to isolate the problem to the device and not the charging cord or the AC wall adapter.  After days-long charging attempts, I finally resigned myself to the fact either the charging port, battery or motherboard was defective and made contact with Samsung for repair.  That experience earned half the bad rating.  If you have a tablet and it develops a problem needing repair, It may be instructive for me to explain the morass of dealing with Samsung repairs.\n\nFirst, the repair center is a Samsung contractor, CVE, and it has a firewall from customer contact through use of :\"call centers\".  These folks know nothing about electronics and interface with customers to begin the administrative steps to get the device sent to the repair center.  A repair ticket number is assigned and emailed to you, but expires in 14-days.  A label is sent to you for UPS to return the device, and in my case, the call  center rep said it was pre-paid, but in fact, UPS charged me for the pickup.  After receiving the repair center device, I received an email stating \"no defects found\".  Mind you, this after I took a week to troubleshoot every variable.  Changing cable connections, replacing adapters, etc. I even did a factory reset with Samsung embedded apps only.  Still charged in no less than 20-24 hours. I replied to the email by asking them to describe troubleshooting methods and if the adapter and charging cord supplied were tested with the device to replicate exactly what I had experienced for a week of troubleshooting prior to shipping, and my wife had been experiencing for a year or more. I asked iof they read my bulletized list of problems I experienced in my tests, with my phone number added. No response.\n\nSo, I called the number listed for the repair center online only to get..a call center rep.  She couldn't explain why I was told no defect was found.  I asked what the status was now.  She looked at her computer screen and said, \"it has been submitted for re-evaluation\".  That would have only happened if I hadn't sent the email asking for answers. Days later, I received a call from..a call center rep.  They wanted a credit card to charge me for repairs and return.  I explained I had not received a diagnosis, or details of defects/parts.  She explained she was only authorized to take my credit card.  \"May I speak to someone about the repairs needed\".  Then began a series of back and forth call center fun and games.  Finally, one informed me that she would call the repair center for details.  She placed me on hold then came back to say her number wasn't working.  I was not surprised.  The good news, she said, is that the motherboard and battery would be replaced and needed my credit card number to begin repairs.  I said, how did we go from a diagnosis of \"no defects found\" to EVERYTHING internally would need to be replaced?  She had no answers.  I asked ot speak to a higher level manager.  She said it wold take 2-3 business days.\n\nThree days later, someone called and asked for my payment to begin the  repairs.  I asked of he was higher-level management.  He said yes.  I asked why did we go from nothing to everything is wrong.  He had no answers.  He admitted he was just a rep from..you got it, a call center.  Finally, under pressure, he provided my with the holy grail..the repair center's number, or so he said.  I was skeptical and asked him repeatedly, is this REALLY the repair center's number?  Oh, yes, \"Donald\" assured me.  Meanwhile, I'm now receiving automatically generated messages to send in my device for repair.  Today, 2/22/2017, I called the number and got on the line....a rep from A CALL CENTER, who wanted my credit card.  I explained what had transpired and why I was getting very annoyed.  Exasperated she said her options for me included returning the tablet unrepaired, taking payment to begin the repair, or, upon my request, getting a return call from a \"higher-level\" manager.  Skeptical, I said, I was told that last time and it was a call center rep.  How can I trust that it will be REAL executive who can help resolve this very simple question\"  \"why did my  tablet diagnosis go from noting is defective to all is defective, and cost isn't just the repair shops way to end the issue by replacing the motherboard and battery?  And, in my head, I'm asking, \"will they actually replace anything\"?  She promised it will be a manager.  Bet it will be a call center rep looking for payment or a decision.\n\nBottom line.  If you need repairs on a tablet (it's possible CVE repairs all Samsung devices) and are accustomed to the industry standard of returning the product for repairs, waiting for a diagnostic examination and a report, usually in a call, explanation identifying the problem and what needs  repairing, fuggeddaboutit.  Now, I understand why so many people lodge complaints about Samsung poor customer service experience.  The irony?  I have half-dozen Samsung flat-screen TVs, the tablet, and have my wife and I have owned every cell phone beginning with the Galaxy 4 to my Galaxy S7 Edge.. Stay tuned.  My tablet saga continues.\n\nUPDATE:  3/72017\nApparently, Samsung corporate noted this review, and if so, it should encourage buyers that manufactures patrol reviews to leanr customer feedback and experiences.\n\nFinally, Angela K, Samsung Executive Customer Relations specialist called me.  She seemed genuinely concerned that I had suffered this dizzying experience with the repair service and put the burden completely on Samsung.  She made short work of it, had my  tablet repaired and shipped out in a day.  She even provided an email address for follow-up, a sure sign of remediation attempt.\n\nDid the repairs work?  Absolutely.  Upon return, the tablet charged in 5 hours to 100%, and in every test of using it until the battery discharges to about 26%, it charges up reliability every-time to full capacity. It also was returned with the charging port making a very tight connection. This makes for a perfect fit and charging process.\n\nWhat am to conclude?  That when purchased, the tablet was a lemon.  This isn't uncommon as there is an industry failure rate or \"exposure rate\": out of 10,000 made, there is a slight numerical incidence of failures.  This places even great importance on the manufacturer's repair service to operate a top-drawer service with excellent customer service.\n\nBottom Line:  SAMSUNG NEEDS TO PERFORM A SYSTEMIC REVIEW TO ENSURE ITS GREAT PRODUCTS ARE MATCHED IN REPAIR SERVICE EXCELLENCE FOR THE SAKE OF ITS CONSUMER REPUTATION.\n\nThen, everyone wins.  And, fair is fair.  Although the one-star rating was deserved, now changing and raising it by two-more stars is deserved for finally \"getting it right\".  The tablet's performance  and value was never in question."}

However it's very limited to whom someone that like the more PC platform and the way they work\nCons: Battery life is lacking.  I use mine on and off all day, not at full brightness but bright enough.  I do email, Internet surfing, and some high graphic games.  Battery will last 4-6 hours set up that way. I often have to charge it throughout the day.  For example, i have used it 11.5 hours today but I had 20 percent battery left so i slapped it on charge about 2 hours ago.

ITs good to have high end tech but Samsung should support it.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "I bought my Titanium Bronze Galaxy Tab S 10.5 back in November 2014, just over 2 years ago, and I still love it.  The Super AMOLED 2560x1600 display is simply stunning - STILL one of  the best tablet screens available.  It came with a hi-rez landscapes video demo that I keep around because it still amazes me showing off the Tab S's sharpness, color and detail.\n\nWe mainly use the Tab S 10.5 for web surfing, music (with a bluetooth speaker), and watching streaming video (Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, etc), which it excels at.  It was my lifeline to sanity during a lengthy hospital stay (thank god for free wi-fi!).  Sound quality of the built-in speakers is fine but headphones or a bluetooth speaker will do better.\n\nIn my 2+ years of ownership, I've had no problems with my Tab S 10.5.  I keep it in a slim leather-ish case/cover and it's survived a few drops from bed or table height with no damage.  Battery life is decent, giving 6-10 hours of mixed surfing and video watching.  It has a microSD card slot to provide extra storage space for music, video, etc. files up to 128GB.\n\nThe most inexplicable thing is that the price went up over $200 since I bought mine.  Yeah, limited availability is probably part of that, but the 9.7\" Tab S2 isn't that much cheaper (or better, for that matter).  I've started being very careful with my Tab S now since replacing it won't be an option.  The tablet wars are apparently over, unfortunately."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "I purchased this tablet in January of 2015. Originally I just loved this Android wifi tablet and the Android 5 Lollipop OS.\n\nOn, or around, September of 2016, I received an Over the Air (OTA) update of the Android operating system to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Since that update, the tablet will often restart itself. I was using the tablet as part of the control system for Phantom 4 quadcopter. As you might imagine, when the tablet reboots itself while flying, it creates a major safety hazard. Had to purchase a different tablet for use with the Phantom.\n\nI contacted Samsung support. Of course the tablet is out of warranty. They claim this is not a know issue, though it is all over the internet when you do a Google search. They requested that I do a factory reset. Did so and had to reload all my apps. No improvement. So I emailed them again and told them just wanted to send it in and have them downgrade the OS back to Lollipop. Told them I would pay the service charge. I received an email response saying they couldn't do that. C'mon now. What they mean is they wouldn't do it. I'm going to have to find a local source who can do this for me.\n\nThis evening, the tablet rebooted itself three times.\n\nMy wife and I currently have Samsung phones and tablets. But, I will NEVER buy another Samsung product. They did a huge disservice when they automatically updated the OS and my wonderful tablet is now a piece of garbage."}

Next  time you charge, drain the battery down to zero until the device turns off (increasing brightness and screen-on time helps)\nb.) charge battery to 100% -- then use the tablet as you normally would\nc.) this should be repeated a few times when new, and then every couple months thereafter\nTry these steps to see if that helps with your battery charging/cycle life.\n\n10-30-17\nSo the 10.5 is the bee's knee's - rooting helped but if anyone ever thought getting Windows to run smooth well, try one of these bloatware-filled Samsung tablets.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "Hands-down the best electronics purchase I've ever made. This tablet is incredible. The screen is what you expect from Samsung OLED : black is absolutely black and the colors are truly vibrant. The 16:9 aspect ratio is the way to go. I still don't know why Samsung reverted to the 4:3 ratio for later versions. For web browsing, YouTube/movies, and email, the widescreen format is exactly what you need. 16GB may seem too small for storage nuts, but the microSD slot can easily (and cheaply) boost your storage.\n\nI'm indifferent about the bronze-ish color scheme. I immediately slapped a folding protective cover on, which I recommend for anyone who does not want to test the Tab S build quality against the inevitable drop off of the sofa or table. If you're put off by the color scheme, remember that you're not paying to look at the back of it; what you should care about is that gorgeous screen, which is more than worth the money."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "I purchased this Galaxy Tab S 10.5\" tablet to replace an aging Galaxy Tab 3 8.0\" tablet that has a dying battery. I could have replaced that battery, but decided that I really wanted the larger high-res screen of the Tab S. I have used the new tablet for a week, and will start this initial review with a list of first impressions presented as bullet points.\n\n1. What separates this tablet from most others in the 8\" to 10\" size range is obviously the display. At 25601600 pixels, with a screen resolution of 288 pixels per inch, the Super AMOLED display is superb for viewing small print text, still photos, or HD video. The dual quad-core processors really make a difference when viewing videos: this tablet plays videos noticeably smoother than the same video file played on my Galaxy Tab 3 8.0\".\n\n2. For such a large tablet, the weight is not bad. It weighs only about 15% more than my 8\" Galaxy Tab 3, despite being much larger.\n\n3. This tablet, Samsung model number SM-T800, is officially supported by CyanogenMod, which currently has a build of CM version 12 available. CyanogenMod v. 12 uses the Android v. 5 \"Lolipop\" kernal, so flashing the tablet with this ROM not only gets rid of all the useless Samsung and Google bloatware, it also updates the tablet from KitKat to Lolipop. I installed CM-12 on the tablet right out of the box (voiding my warranty, I know, but that's another issue), and it worked perfectly, first time. A few taps to enable Developer Options and Root Access, and the tablet is now fully \"mine\", and operates the way I need it to, and not the way Google thinks it should. Unfortunately, the stupid restriction that Google put on Kit Kat, of not allowing Apps to write to the external SD card, was carried over into Lolipop, and thus also into this build of CyanogenMod, so you have to do the well-known hack on the \"platform.xml\" file to remove the restriction, but it's easy to do since CyanogenMod has root access. There's another cool feature in this CyanogenMod build: Mass Storage Mode is back! Unfortunately, it's only for the external SD card, and not for the Internal Storage, but it's better than not having UMS at all. Of course, there's always the MTP-Alternative app, which gives \"drive letter access\" to both the Internal and External storage, but MTP-Alternative has a few quirks of it's own; since it's a TCP/IP based interface, it's speed is considerably slower than UMS, and it may choke when asked to transfer really big files like videos. NOTE: If you want to use MTP-Alternative to write files from your Windows PC to your Android device, the device has to be rooted and the \"platform.xml\" hack has to be in place. Since this tablet is being officially supported by the CyanogenMod development organization, there is a good possibility that CM version 13 will become available for it, which would update the tablet to Android v. 6 \"Marshmallow\". This would bring to the Tab S the ability to integrate an external SD card of up to 128 gB as \"Adoptable\" storage, expanding the space available for Apps and App data by a factor of at least 10x over the slightly less than 11 gB of internal storage available to the user now.\n\n4. If you don't have the desire to run a custom firmware ROM like CyanogenMod, the stock KitKat operating system the tablet comes with is okay, except for the horrible restriction of apps not being able to write to the external SD card. To work around this, the tablet has to be \"rooted\", which immediately voids your warranty, so that you can make two small edits in the /system/etc/permissions/platform.xml file. You have to root the tablet to even be able to \"see\" this file, otherwise, the system will not allow your file manager or any text editor to access the file even for reading, let alone editing. If you're going to have to root the tablet to get rid of the write restriction on the external SD card, you might as well just replace the stock KitKat OS with CyanogenMod 12.1.\n\n5. Form factor: This tablet is unbelievably thin and light (16.4 ounces, or 465 grams). It's hard to believe there's a 7900 mAH battery in there. The buttons are on the long side of the tablet, rather than the short side, which is what I am used to on Samsung devices, but I'll get used to it, I suppose. Becuse this tablet is so large and so thin, and the bezel is so small, don't even think for a moment that you will be using this thing \"naked\", the way it comes out of it's factory packaging. You absolutely have to buy a case for it: order one on Amazon when you order the tablet. There are many cases available, in prices ranging from $9 for a basic one, to $40 for a fancy one. I have the $9 ProCase, and have also used a $12 MoKo case on my 8\" tablet. They're cheap, but they do protect the tablet from most damages, and make it much easier to hold.\n\n6. Included software: The usual mix of software, ranging from functional apps that you need to play music or video files, or look at photos, read text, and do email, to \"bloatware\" with almost no conceivable use. There's hundreds of megabytes of this junk, and you can't delete it unless you root the tablet. And in some respects, it's risky to delete software on an Android device unless you really are sure what you're doing. There's a lot of cross-linking of Android software, and deleting something could have unforeseen adverse consequences. For example, on my old Galaxy Tab 3, I deleted a certain system file while trying to disable the oh-so-annoying Google pop-up that always asks if you want to use WiFi to increase accuracy when doing GPS navigation. BTW, this is one of the stupidest pop-ups I've ever seen - how could the programmer at Google who wrote that prompt have even thought that someone driving a motor vehicle would even HAVE access to WiFi?. Anyway, I deleted the file, and doing so did indeed get rid of the annoying pop-up, but only later did I discover that deleting that file permanently broke several other Google apps, including Gmail and the Play Store. I had to re-install the operating system completely to fix this \"oops\", which nuked all my App data. Shortly after that, I installed CyanogenMod on that tablet, which took care of the problem. For what it's worth, almost all of the Samsung and Google software that comes bundled can be replaced with third-party apps that are at least as good, if not better, from the Play Store. These include Office productivity suites, Music and Video players, Games, text editors, Calculator emulators, Keyboard emulators (I like The Hacker's Keyboard), Internet Browsers (the tablet comes with Chrome, which I immediately replaced with Firefox), tons of Clock widgets, E-book readers (I like FBReader), File and Task Managers (ES File Manager/Task Manager), etc. etc. With something like a half-million apps on the Play Store, I'm sure you can find enough apps with which to fritter your whole life away.\n\n7. Camera: The 8 mpx built-in camera is pretty basic. It shoots JPEG's that are about 1.5 megabyte file size, so they're rather heavily compressed. The camera lens can be zoomed a little, maybe 3x, and light sensitivity is pretty low, as you would expect from a camera lens and sensor this small. It really only works well in full daylight. There is a built-in LED flash that helps a little, but it's range is limited, maybe 3 to 4 feet. I guess if you are trying to take photos indoors at a kid's birthday party or something similar, the LED light is better than nothing. But I'd rather have a real camera in the first place for something as important as my kid's or grandkid's birthday. Remarkably, the camera has a HUGE range of focus, from infinity down to just an inch or two, which I was not expecting. The front camera is very low resolution, 1.2 mpx, which I guess is enough for VOIP services like Skype (I haven't tried it myself). Bottom line is that this camera isn't very good - even the bottom of the line Canon and Nikon pocket cameras take better photos. Don't buy this tablet for the camera.\n\nNOTE: If you do decide to go with CyanogenMod, the Camera applet that comes with it is not as feature rich as the Samsung OEM Camera app, but with the tablet boasting only a modest 8 megapixel camera, I suggest that the slightly less capable camera app should not stop you from at least considering CyanogenMod, at least after the 1 year warranty expires and you've got nothing to lose by flashing a non-Samsung ROM. BTW, if you flash CyanogenMod v12.1 and decide you don't like it, you can easily restore the tablet back to it's original state by re-flashing it with the OEM operating system (currently Android v 4.4.2 Kit Kat). This is a 1.8 gigabyte file, named [XAR-T800XXU1ANFB-20140707180849.zip] available from several sources on the Internet. You use the \"ODIN\" program on your PC to \"sideload\" this file back onto the tablet in \"download\" mode. NOTE: This ZIP file has a \"tar\" file inside it, and it's this \"tar\" file that you actually sideload with ODIN.\n\nNegatives: All of the above should be considered this tablet's \"positive\" attributes. That said, there is at least one \"negative\", and that's the speakers. Playing MP3 or Video files, they only sound acceptable (actually they're quite good) up to about 50% of full volume. From 50% to 75%, there's an ever-increasing amount of distortion and clipping, and above 75% the distortion is horrible. This distortion is definitely in the speakers, and not in the tablet's audio processing hardware: using headphones, music sounds great all the way to 100% volume. This issue is mostly noticeable when using the tablet as an alarm clock, with a music file as the alarm tone. In alarm clock mode, you're probably going to have the volume cranked up high, unless you're a light sleeper, and waking up in the morning to a favorite song being mangled by overdrive distortion through inadequate speakers isn't my idea of the start of a wonderful day. I guess you can work around this by using one of those portable speakers, bypassing the built-in ones, but then that's another gadget you have to carry.\n\nSummary: If you want a tablet that really offers the most screen space and resolution possible, but a 12\" or larger tablet is simply too large or too expensive, this Tab S 10.5\" tablet is arguably the \"ultimate\" tablet in Samsung's model lineup. The new Tab S2 models are a little less expensive, but that's because they are \"downgraded\": they are using a 4:3 aspect ratio screen, with a lower overall resolution, and a smaller capacity battery, rather than the 16:10 screen of the Tab S 10.5, which makes them a little less pleasing for watching wide-screen movies or playing certain games designed for 16:10 tablets. If you are also a \"power user\", this tablet is officially supported by the CyanogenMod Project, and CyanogenMod-12.1 (Android v5 \"Lolipop\") is available now, with possibly CM-13 (Android v6 \"Marshmallow\") coming sooner or later. I will be updating this review from time to time, or if any problems crop up with the tablet. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nLAST WORD: This is a WiFi ONLY Tablet! It DOES NOT have Cell Phone capability! I can't believe how many people ask the question \"can this tablet access GSM towers?\"\n\nUPDATE December 29, 2016 - Two problems have appeared with my tablet. The first is that the battery charge capacity seems to be declining noticeably, and much sooner than I would have expected. The tablet is only a few months old, yet the battery charge drops at a rate more like that of a tablet that's 3 or 4 years old. This could be simply a manufacturing defect in the battery, or perhaps the very large, very high resolution of the screen makes this tablet more of a power hog than what I was used to with my 8\" Galaxy Tab 3 that this 10.5\" Tab S replaced.  The second problem is also charging related: the MicroUSB connector has developed a problem, in that it has become very finicky about which charging cables I can use with the tablet. I own 4 or 5 chargers, both 120vAC and 12vDC, and a half-dozen or more cables, and the one one that still charges this tablet is one that originally came with my LG-840G cell phone. The strange thing is that the Tablet's charge indicator shows that the tablet is charging, but only the LG cell phone charger and cable actually push charge into the tablet. The various other chargers and MicroUSB cables that are not working properly with this tablet all do work properly to charge my old 8\" Samsung Tab 3, and my cell phone. So the problem seems to be in the Tab S connector, or maybe it's battery. I am going to order a new charger and cable and see if this solves the problem."}

If this is the first tablet you have ever owned or if you are a complete android user this might make sense for you.  BUT....if you currently own or have ever owned an ipad this tablet will leave you wanting.  It has a lot of apps preloaded that take up your memory and you cannot remove them.  They are permanent whether you ever use them or not.  It is slower than the ipad and less intuitive.  One other thing that annoys me all the time is it does not charge well on any cord other than a Samsung and will not charge at all on 95% of the cords you have for other USB charging stations.  Since I have two kids in the house I have a dozen cords around and have to hide my samsung cord or it just becomes a useless piece of electronics until I track down the correct charge cord.  If you have always been a droid fan, then this is probably a good choice as you know what to expect from them.  After a year of using this tablet I still find myself looking at my ipad and knowing I am soon going back to it and putting the Samsung on moth balls.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "I am extremely disappointed with this tablet. For starters, using the touch screen for typing is hell. I'm not typing essays or anything but I have a difficult time typing the little text that I do type. You can also throw in the fact that you may need a stylus pen in order for the tablet to accurately do as you wish. You can tap one part of the screen and it may do something completely different. Secondly, the lag is unbearable. Some have said that the bloatware is to blame and I'm leaning towards that conclusion as well. The frequency at which this thing freezes is also a major con. The battery life is also another huge setback for this tablet. Usually when I purchase a new device, one of the first things I do is look for ways to preserve battery life. I tried to preserve the battery life of this tablet by eliminating a lot of useless,  resource draining processes but the battery life is still poor. I can read a book or maybe browse the Web for 20 minutes and the battery will decline by 10%! Nothing that I did could stop the battery from draining extremely fast. Not only is the battery life poor, this thing charges extremely slow as well. I had to purchase a high-powered charger from a third party in order to get this tablet to charge in the time that it should. Before then, I'd be lucky if it charged 7% in an hour.\n\nI'm going to go back to iPad if I ever want a tablet. This tablet has ruined the Samsung experience for me."}

A couple of months ago the device developed a green line on the screen (near the bottom in portrait mode) that would not go away. While the device was still in warranty, I called Samsung service. The agent walked me through a factory reset, determined that there was indeed a problem, and emailed me a prepaid UPS label. The entire phone conversation, from connection to hangup, took 16 minutes. I packed up the device and took it to my local UPS store .... and it was back, fixed, in 48 hours. For what it is worth, I live in Dutchess County, NY and the service center was in New Jersey."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "Loved it at first.  It's been less than a year and the battery won't charge.  Out of the box I had to buy an SD card because of all the garbage bloatware that couldn't be uninstalled.  Even with that, a lot of the programs can't be moved to the SD card or they automatically move back to the internal storage every time there is an update so I'm constantly shuffling things around to make space.  But the real killer is the aforementioned battery.  I almost exclusively use it while it's plugged in and it still won't hold a charge.  I charged it all night and woke up to find it at 66%.  At least with a laptop you can totally take the battery out and use it with 120VAC power plugged in but this thing actually loses charge as I go.  I'll make sure my next one has a replaceable battery or can function solely off outlet power."}

Now, it seems there is not one independent repair shop who can get access to the part. You are forced to go though Samsung support, do almost all the legwork yourself, and wait 10 days to get quoted over $250 for a simple glass repair. Not economical. The response included the denial of a warranty repair since warranty does not apply to glass repairs. I am not surprised. Why did the phone support not tell me this?\n\nSo, if you are looking for a beautiful tablet you can actually risk using as a mobile device, I suggest you purchase a cheaper Android tablet that allows for economic repairs from an independent shop. Or just do yourself a favor and get an iPad. My 2011 iPad is still going strong. Very sturdy and reliable.\n\nSamsung - with this one you shot yourself in the foot."}

I've googled it, and MANY people with all types of Galaxy tabs are having the same issue.  I've tried every \"fix\" suggested, tried Best Buy tech support as well as Samsung--no one knows whats wrong or how to fix it, and the end solution from Samsung Tech support was \"Buy our latest Tablet to replace it\".  If I would have know I was purchasing a tablet with a 1 year life span, I would have just bought a cheap tablet, not a $600 tablet. I'm even regretting not going with an Apple Device, even though I prefer android over Apple. Buyer Beware!"}

It is thin, light, and the screen is incredible!\n\nI figured I'd focus on the two issues I have with the tablet.\n\n1) Although you can dim the screen it seems to be very dark at the lower end, then about 1/10th of the way toward bright it just steps up noticeably, and then it gets much brighter right at the end.  It's too bad there is not more darkness gradient at the lower end of the slider, it's just very dark to kind of bright very rapidly.\n\n2) No matter the brightness of the screen, every time you touch the screen the back button and window button (on either side of the physical button under the screen) light up full brightness.  This can be annoying if you're reading in bed in the dark for instance, with the brightness the whole way down, but it keeps flashing you with bright light every time you scroll!\n\nOverall this tablet is spectacular and I don't think there is a better tablet available elsewhere, but that doesn't mean this one has no room for improvement.  Also, make sure to get a case, I really like the Samsung one that snaps into the two button holes in the back!"}

The annoyance of Sammy apps you can't remove, like the Hancom apps that INSIST on updating fonts even if you are not on WiFi (which means delays and 4G $$$) would have taken away a star.  Eleven months into ownership, the battery performance of my Tab S began to fail... as in 1% decrease every 2 minutes while surfing the Web.  One week after the warranty expired, Bluetooth failed.  The next week, WiFi failed.  Also, the Tab S has an incredible amount of adhesive securing the system board to the housing... don't believe the \"you can replace your battery with a spudger\" videos.  The planned obsolescence of Samsung tablets after the Notepad 10.5 and 12.2 has become obvious, even more so in the Tab S2 (smaller battery, higher clock rate SOC).

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "This is probably the best tablet on the market right now, bar none.  The 10.5\" 2560x1600 screen is vividly bright and sharp, the eight-core Exynos processor cleverly combines high performance with power efficiency, and battery life is good  it'll go all day on a full charge, even watching videos.\n\nThe smartest thing about this tablet is its processor.  It's really two four-core processors in one  an efficient one, and a high-performance one.  When it's idling or doing un-demanding tasks like, say, displaying an e-book, it runs on the four low-power CPU cores to maximize its battery life.  Ask it to do something demanding like play a game or a high-defniition movie, and it seamlessly switches to the four high-performance cores.  You won't even know it's done it.\n\nThere are larger screens available, like Samsung's 12.1\" Galaxy Tab Pro.  However, they come burdened down with a lot of faux-business applications that you probably don't want, and they're not enough bigger to justify their price premium.  The Galaxy Tab S has a big enough and sharp enough screen to make it a superb e-reader, while still slipping into a jacket pocket.  Granted, there's some bloatware on the Tab S as well, starting with \"My Magazine\" aka Flipboard, the Samsung bloatware app that 90% of Samsung owners learn to love to hate, but which Samsung won't let us remove.  But it's not bad, and Flipboard can at least be locked out.\n\nTo be fair, there is one downside to the Galaxy Tab S, and that is its fingerprint scanner ... which, bluntly, is utterly worthless.  It has to scan your fingertip nine or ten times to \"learn\" it, and every time you swipe it, you have to have the angle, and the pressure, and the speed all just right, or it won't recognize your print.  Hand's sweaty?  So sorry, try again.  And even when you do get it working, it can only recognize one fingertip per user.  I tried the fingerprint authentication for about a week, before I gave up on it after the \"cool factor\" wore out next to the \"swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe slower, a bit to the left, slower, now straighter, make sure you swipe the entire fingertip...\"  ....oh, forget it, it's easier to just type a password.  Sorry, Samsung, but this is a terrible fingerprint-scanner implementation that isn't likely to accomplish anything but souring users on fingerprint authentication.\n\nNow my Barska biometric safe, by comparison, could show Samsung how it's done.  But I digress...\n\nAnother shortcoming specific to this model is ... look, OK, just spring for the 32GB internal storage, OK?  16GB really isn't enough.  It SHOULD be enough; but unfortunately, Android is atrociously bad at managing storage.  You SHOULD be able to tell Android \"Use the SD card slot for everything possible, use the internal storage only when you have to.\"  But you can't.  And that's a shame, because Android, based on Linux, should be able to do much better.  This is not a hard problem.\n\nBut this is really Android's fault, not Samsung's.\n\nSamsung has recently released their new Galaxy Tab S2, but it's not clear to me yet what the technical improvements in it are, and it's not available in a 10.5\" screen (yet) anyway.  If you're looking for a 10\"-range touchscreen tablet, look no further.  This is the one to buy."}

Even when fresh out of the box, it was difficult to get the charger to plug in.  It fit ok if you wiggled it around.  So, about 3 months after purchase it stopped charging and was soon dead. It was too late for an Amazon return so I contacted Samsung Support and was issued a shipping label to ship it in.  I had it back within a week and all seemed well.  3 months later, same thing, same process, except this time they claim I caused the so called 'Damage\" to the unit and want $80 to fix it.  I\"m not sure what they are talking about as there isn't any that I could see, the unit just won't charge.  The USB charging port is poorly attached and too fragile for everyday use.\n\nEverything else with the unit is wonderful: the screen, the UI, the apps, the sound.  It just doesn't work because it can't charge.  Poor design, probably in pursuit of \"thin\".  Not well made and I told them to ship it back, at least I can use it as a $600 paperweight.  I'll get an Ipad Air.  Guess I won't be buying that Galaxy s6 to go with this since it won't work.  Oh, and that new 75\" Flat screen I'm thinking about?

However, with 3 years behind the wheel, my Asus was giving up and I was in the market looking for a replacement. Decided to get this over a fire tab.\n\nPros:\n1. 3 GB RAM - one of the most important features to ensure your tab does not lag. Only tab in the market with this size screen and this much RAM\n2. Octa core processor - one of the fastest in the market\n3. Android 5\n4. Thin and light - lighter than Ipad Air\n5. Fingerprint sensor for authentication\n\nCons:\n1. Too much bloatware - you can, of course, disable apps, but cannot remove them without rooting\n\nIn the same price range as the fire HDX, IMHO, this is a better deal and a value for money.\n\nRecommended."}

BUT there are a few big problems.\n\nThe worst problem is the battery/charging issue.  I've already had to replace the charging port once because it broke internally.  After it was replaced it worked fine for about a month.  But now it's barely charging at all despite having no signs of damage.\n\nThe other problem is the SD cards that it chews up and spits out.  For some reason it decides it doesn't like the SD card and it corrupts it.  It's destroyed 3 cards already (including 2 Samsung cards). I am not replacing the SD card again.\n\nSo, although I love the tablet, these two things have made me wish I never bought it.  Unfortunately, I am well past the exchange/return date.  So I'm stuck with it.  It's very depressing."}

The other Android tablets were all second rate compared to this Galaxy Tab S 10.5.  The iPads are nice but they don't have nearly as many free apps available as Android tablets do and I don't find their speed and quality to be any better than this tablet.\n\nI was careless with my first Galaxy Tab S 10.5 and it was stolen.  I guess the thief knew quality when he saw it.  This Galaxy Tab is simply the best one available and I didn't hesitate to buy exactly the same model as a replacement.\n\nThe screen resolution and color is outstanding.  The cameras are good.  The touch screen is extremely responsive and the two quad-core processors don't leave you tapping your foot waiting for you apps to start.\n\nI elected to get the 16GB model.  You can get the 32GB model but it is more expensive.  Since this tablet takes MicroSD cards up to 128GB, that is definitely a much more frugal way to add some storage.\n\nThe only tablets I've seen that might be as good are also Samsungs.  They are both 12.2\" screens and that was a bit large for me.  I'm satisfied with the 10.5\".\n\nI have no intention of letting this one get stolen.  If I was stupid enough to let this one get stolen, I'd buy the same thing again."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "First, I love this tablet.  I have an 8\" Dell Venue with a Microsoft Operating System and this beats it hands down -- easier to use, fantastic screen resolution (and I can actually read without having to use a magnifying glass), great sound (but will connect to external speakers when needed), very decent battery life, expandable memory, Android (love Android), I could go on and on.  Microsoft is finally offering Android for Office, so there is no need for any other tablet.  Android offers more apps -- a big plus over Microsoft.  After you do your homework, I think you will find that this tablet beats Apple and Microsoft feature for feature, and in price.\n  Second, Amazon is working with Android again.  All of the issues playing Prime video have been resolved and an app is available at the Google store.  It works.\n  Third, sometimes electronics go South.  Mine did after 10 months of daily use.  The WiFi and Bluetooth just stopped working and wouldn't load.  Pressing the icon to turn it on did nothing.  The words \"Turning on...\" were the only thing I saw in the Wi-Fi setting.  In WiFi and Bluetooth, no potential systems to connect to were displayed.  The first thing I did was an internet search for the problem -- it has happened to others.  I tried a \"soft\" reboot (involves the Home, Power, and Sound up button) which did not work.  As the product was still under the 12 month Warranty, I logged onto Samsung.com and started to research.  They had NOTHING about this specific issue, so I used Live Chat thru the Samsung website and communicated thru typing with a Samsung Representative.  We went thru the script that must be used when this problems occurs.  Bottom line, I had done everything I could to resolve it and the final process, a factory re-set (which wipes out all of your data), was requested.  We did it.  During the reboot the screen to connect to WiFi came up and we never got past it -- my WiFi would not turn on.  Next I was linked over to \"Request Repair\".  I spent the next hour repeating all that had been done and was told that I would be contacted by Samsung over the telephone.  True to their word, I was and spent the next 15 minutes repeating all that had been done.  Next I was emailed a shipping label for UPS.  So my unit is on its way for repair and I will be spending hours of set-up when it comes back to me.  Is it worth it, YES!!!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "Straight out the box, this thing refuses to connect to my wi-fi. Every other wireless device that has ever entered my house has been able to connect but his thing \"fails to obtain an ip address\" and displays the message \"AP currently not in use. Internet connection slow\". I've tried every suggested solution I can find but the only one that sort of works is for me to manually input my ip address into the tablet. *(how-to below)\nThe problem with this method is that it's only effective at home. I can't get the ip addresses of places like public hotspots.\n\nAlso the tablet - currently running Android 4.2.2 - refuses to update to Lolipop. It'll download just fine but on reboot, the percentage stays around the 25%-30% mark, restarts, tries again, then shows an error message. Infuriating since it is suggested that updating the tablet would solve the wi-fi issue. I tried updating using Samsung's Kies program but nothing happens.\n\nBesides these problem, the tablet is pretty good. The screen is very pretty, the audio is loud-ish and the battery life is impressive, though the charging takes forever (about 6 hours). I could have done without all the bloatware though, most of which cannot be un-installed, only hidden.\n\nFor a $350+ tablet, I am very disappointed with what I got. More so because Samsung has failed to provide a simple online solution. I've bought far cheaper tablets that connect as soon as I input my wi-fi password. It has been suggested that the problem lies with Samsung meddling with the Android os and seeing as this is a Samsung exclusive problem, I'm inclined to agree.\n\n*In the Wi-fi settings, select your internet and click \"Forget\". Then select again, type in your password, select both boxes below (1. Show PW and 2. Show advanced options), scroll down and change IP settings from DHCP to Static and then type in your IP address (google how to) then press connect."}

I paid $399 and it really was worth it. also some of  my games can go on the sd card. I brought a 32gb card, since I spent $399 on the tab that was all I could afford.

But an update came down corrupted the firmware and the tablet ran real slow and many apps and network didn't work. Tried all troubleshooting things including resetting the tablet to original settings still no go.  Called Samsung and they said it needed to be repaired.  They expect you to go around and find suitable packaging material that fits their requirements like keep 4 inches of head room around all sides in the box, use peanuts and a suitable internal covering, ETC ETC.  It cost $20 just to get all the shipping supplies.\nMy problem is not that the tablet broke, hey it happens.  My problem is they way they fix it.  First off they should send a new one and not repair the old. For what they cost they can do it. If the firmware got corrupted once it probably will again, likely when the warranty is over. Also we aren't waiting forever for the repair and we can send back the broke one in the packaging that was sent with the new one.  Makes life easier.  Not to mention its been 8 days and i still don't have the tablet.  IT only took them one day to fix and they sent it back 7 days ago but they sent it ground.  What, couldn't send it 2 days at least?  As much as I hate apple your better off with them if you have a local store.  At least you can bring it there and pick it up there without the shipping hassle and chances are they can fix it on site anyway.  Samsung and apple are close on the price point now so its time samsung steps up.  Last thing i actually got a call today from Samsung support asking me how my service went and wanted me to take a survey.  I told them its been 8 days and still don't have the tablet and started to tell them what I thought (respectfully)  THEY HUNG UP ON ME!!  They shouldn't of asked if they didn't want to know..."}

This is my first tablet and I use a desktop most of the time so I was really happy with how fast this tablet is. The low score is for how Samsung stands behind this tablet. I have not had the tablet long, it's only had to be recharged 3 times since I bought it. I actually bought it to take with me and my family on vacation. I was using it one morning for maybe 30 minutes and put it on the bed to take a walk on the beach with my family and it was fine when I left it, but when I returned I went to turn it back on and in the middle of the bottom part of the screen it looked like a spider web of cracks towards the outside edges of the screen. It was in a leather carrying case and it had not been dropped or handled rough in any way. When I contacted Samsung about it when I got home they said that the screen was not covered by the warranty and I would have to pay to have it fixed, and from there authorized repair department they wanted $255.60 to replace just the glass screen. Everything on it still works fine just the glass is cracked. I have since read on forums of other people having the exact same problem and Samsung refusing to stand behind there tablets. I guess this was a expensive lesson for me to not buy Samsung products because they don't stand behind them. The only reason that I can figure for the screen cracking the way it did was that the glass was to tight of a fit for the tablet and it was in a bind. To me this is there design flaw and they should stand behind it. Live and learn."}

I read research by professional techies, pored over recommendations at blog sites, and asked many others what they enjoy using for a tablet.  The overwhelming response was the Apple brand.  That said, the next best choice was the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 Tablet.\n\nSince I use an Android phone and don't have Apple products, it seemed pointless to buy a Tablet that would not seamlessly sync with my other electronics.  If you are an Apple user, you would probably be wise to choose one of this brands products.\n\nI love my Samsung tablet!  It was quite easy to learn how to use it.  The size and light weight make it a pleasure to use and carry.  The color is vivid; the clarity is sharp, with a resolution of 2560 x 1600.  Samsung lets the user determine the screens brightness.  As a result, it can be used both indoors and out with ease.\n\nThe sound is sharp and I find no problems with it.  Watching a movie and hearing its content is a pleasure.  There is no sense of muffled sound at all.\n\nThe tablet connects to my WiFi at home.  If I take it out, I can connect via my phone.  And battery life is remarkably long lasting.  After doing emails, reading, and practicing how to use it, my battery power (after three days) is a strong 56%.\n\nI like the touch screen technology and when writing emails, it has the ability to learn my writing style; often offering words before Ive even fully typed or selected them.\n\nI initially wanted to use my tablet to take pictures while on a trip.  It has more pixels (8 front facing) than my older Canon camera.  My phone can take a comparable picture, too, as compared to the tablet.  Money had to be considered, also.  So, I had a choice; I could buy a camera or a tablet.  I opted for the tablet, choosing to take pictures with my phone.  The Samsung Galaxy allows me so much more than a camera.  I can do emails, read my Kindle books, watch movies, listen to music, play games, and write.  Yes, it would be nice to have an extremely good camera, but this was the best choice overall.\nWhether this is your first tablet purchase, or you're replacing one, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 Tablet is one you can select with confidence."}

Great for taking my movie collection with me when deploying. I even have the ability to hook this up to my tv via HDMI with a $10 cable. Accessories for this are so much cheaper. I might be swapping all of my stuff over to android soon!"}

I grew tired of trying to use my smartphone as a mini productivity platform so I started looking at tablets.  After reading many, many...many reviews I chose the Galaxy Tab S 10.5 and am very satisfied with the purchase.  Vibrant screen (makes my laptop look dim and bland), fast enough for my needs, and very versatile.  Love the dual window function also.  Allows me to tap into a Wi-Fi hotspot and answer email, shop, read, watch videos, and access all of my work-related websites.  I take it everywhere.  I also bought a MoKo key board case from Amazon for a lot (LOT) less than the keyboard cases offered in the big box stores - it's a must have."}

My previous tablet was an Asus Transformer of which I purchased from the self same dealer.  The reason for the purchase was be able to have an enormous amount of reference material with out the bulk.\n\nThe Transformer was a terrific little machine but seemed sluggish and slow to wake up so I went shopping. Afer much reserch I settled for Samsung.  Not only was it responsive, but the display was something to behold.  Storage was lacking but was advertised to be expandable by 128 GB.  So purchased a 64 GB SD card thinking I could move data from the main storage to the SD card.  Well guess what,  turns the  SD card drive is read only - inexplicable.\n\nToday I took my machine back to my dealer thinking that I simply wasn't following the procedure correctly.  Well my dealer did essentially the same thing I did and it didn't work for him either.  After researching the Internet, and trying the things that they suggested, he reported that the SD card drive was read only.  Had it been anyone but him, I would have thought I was being lied to.  I  still have a hard time thinking as to how this could have happened - and with Samsung.  Seems to me that the FTC should have something to say about it, but then, me being the niev person that I am, only I  would think that our government would care about it's citizens being ripped off.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "My biggest complaint is that the tablet comes with lots of bloatware which cannot be removed by the user. These useless programs take up significant space on your installed memory (16 GB). The free magazine subscriptions require that you give out your credit card number. Don't do it. The magazines hope you forget to cancel when the free period ends at which time they will charge your card. A Chinese consumer protection group is suing Samsung over the bloatware issue.\n\nThe quality of the pictures is great and the sound is better than what I can get from a MagicBox speaker.\n\nI bought a 128 GB micro card to store videos and pictures. I also got a case and a stylus pen.\n\nDon't expect to do any heavy duty work on the tablet. Think of it as a toy or an entertainment gadget and you won't be disappointed.\n\nUpdate June 10, 2016\n\nMy Samsung tablet still works but the company never did anything about the bloatware and it has not updated the Android OS to the latest version. Mine still says version 5.0.2 (Lollipop) even though the Marshmallow version of Android has been available for months. I got a Bose SoundLink Mini to improve the sound when I listen to Spotify. Spotify has become my \"killer app\". I don't think the tablet is secure enough to use for any financial transactions. The tablet works well with the 128 GB SD card I bought and plays many different types of video files. It also works well with my Spotify enabled Yamaha receiver."}

But, I added a 32GB microSD card and I got better at moving pictures, etc. to the cloud.\n\nThe only glitch I've ever had was following a software update.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "6-20-2015\n\nThe first one arrived yesterday but there was a severe defect. I am returning it today. I ordered another one with the 2 year warranty that is not from Samsung.\n\nPros\n- Amazing display\n\nCons\n- I bought this to replace my 10.1 Note that was 1.5 years old. The screen suddenly went black. When I received this the screen would intermittently turn on and off. By slightly moving the tablet it would get better or worse so I think it is probably a problem with the connection of the screen to the rest of the tablet. I see in the 1 star reviews that others had this problem as well as other screen problems such as the screen just going dark. After researching this, I believe that Samsung has a design, manufacturing, or quality control issue with the connection of the screen to the rest of the tablet.\n\n- The micro USB connector was moved from bottom (on my Note) to the right side. This is a significant problem as I have a couple of apps that I use a lot that do not rotate. They place the USB connector on the bottom. This makes it hard to use the device while charging. I hope Samsung returns the USB connector back to the bottom in future models.\n\n- After reading the negative reviews, it seems Samsung has poor customer support. I wish Samsung would improve this. When I re-ordered the tablet today, I also ordered the 2 year warranty from another company.\n\n8-6-2015 Update\n\nThe 16 GB of memory is now full. Most of the free memory is taken up by apps. When trying to move the apps to the memory card many cannot be moved or when they can be moved, most of the app stays on the device memory. I am very unhappy with this. Samsung should start supplying their equipment with a minimum of 32 GB of internal memory and have 64 and 128 GB options available. I am lowering my rating from 4 to 3 stars.\n\n9-9-2015\n\nThis is an additional update. I am downgrading this to 1 star. 15 GB of internal memory is not enough. I am now totally out of memory. I tried to move the apps to the external 64 GB memory card but only a portion of the apps will move. This is insane. In addition, the device comes loaded with apps that I do not want but cannot remove.\n\nIn addition, moving the micro USB connector to the side is very problematic. There are a number of apps including FaceBook pictures that require setting the device in portrait mode on the side where the micro USB connector is. It is not possible to use the device like this with the micro USB connector plugged in.\n\nI am beginning to hate this device. My suggestion to Samsung is to make future devices with 32-128 GB of internal memory and to move the micro USB connector on the side where the home and other icons are."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "(As of 6/12/15 fully updated to Lollipop 5.0.2 and paired with a 32GB Samsung Pro MicroSD)\n\nI really want to love my Galaxy Tab S 10.5, but it is more like a friend with benefits in that some things just bug me enough not to use it as much as I should.  Despite having 3GB of ram to cache more running processes and applications, the slower CPU really shows itself when loading apps or switching from anything CPU intensive.  Compared to the relatively snappy performance of the quad core 2.5ghz in my S5, screen lag and general responsiveness can be sluggish and downright laggy.  Samsung chose to use 4@1.9ghz and 4@1.3ghz for what is technically 8 cores.  I think the overall faster quad core with less RAM is showing better performance than the slower octa setup and given that they both have separate GPU's, I do not know if the higher resolution graphics @ 2560x1600 over 1920x1080 is a factor in this.  I also know that optimizations can make up for speed and core differences but I don't think that is at play here.\n\nNow, let me say that this is still a fine piece of equipment.  Using my S5 as a mobile hotspot, my Tab 10.5 has the ability to have internet access anywhere I can use my S5 directly.  Normally though, I keep it in my store on wi-fi (5ghz) as a reference tool for databases.  Video looks phenomenal and streaming to other Samsung HDTV's works flawlessly.  Multiple user profiles make it easy to manage additional users although performance is a little more sluggish than usual with more than one profile active.  Quick connect let me setup streaming to my Samsung HDTV easily, but then my S5 (Verizon with 5.0) and wife's Note 4 do as well, not to mention her old off network Sprint Note 2 which is essentially a dedicated video streamer now, using a web interface I wrote for media sharing off my file server. (Seriously, they all work brilliantly at it)\n\nWhat doesn't work is direct media sharing.  There is no NFC (near field communication) and none of the other direct sharing options reliably work.  With every combination I can think of involving \"Nearby Devices\", wi-fi and Bluetooth, Android Beam, Quick Connect, nothing works as all transfers wind up timing out usually after a couple megs.  I have gotten 1 solitary picture to successfully transfer via Wi-Fi direct. I have tried distances from touching to across the room, both on 2.4ghz, then 5ghz and then 1 each WiFi frequencies through the router and still they time out.  NFC works great between my S5 and her Note4.  I can't even connect my S5 directly to the Tab 10.5 with a USB/USBOTG cable because it recognizes the S5 as a \"High Power Device\" and immediately shuts down access.  I imagine I could get a powered hub but at that point using my PC or something like Drive/Dropbox as a go between is simpler. It is things like this that have caused Samsung innovations to be abandoned and revert to iPhone clones...... S6 I am looking at you.\n\nBattery drain in \"standby\" mode with the screen off is almost nil due to having few application that actively sync in the background.  Keep in mind, I have stopped or uninstalled as much bloatware as I can without rooting.  I do not use either Power Saver mode and generally keep bluetooth off unless using a keyboard.  I keep the screen at full brightness.  Depending on the bandwidth involved, battery life seems to be about 10% per hour of usage.  I have yet to get it below 58% in a day yet and that was during all my failed video transfer attempts.\n\nI cannot speak much on it's comfort as a stand alone device meaning I have it in a rather bulky folder/stand/keyboard combo that should protect it quite a bit.  The screen stays relatively smudge free in that they aren't usually noticeable when in use.  The Gorilla Glass 3 screen should hold up very well like my S5 which has been scratch free for almost a year with no screen protector.\n\nSo this might have seemed overly critical but probably because I am comparing it to my darling S5, a device released before the Tab 5.  I know, supposedly different purposes, but other than cellular service, not really.  Tablet wise, with the price drop I jumped on, it is overall a very nice piece of equipment.  I hope I can get a couple years usage out of it.  It is the first time I have allowed myself to buy a higher end device without a user replaceable battery."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "This is a great little tablet. I needed something light because of a limiting disability and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 \"fit the bill.\" The only draw back (which really has nothing to do with the tablet's quality), after purchasing, I realized that Samsung had a new Galaxy available, the 12.2. ALSO. Had I known the different between the TAB and the NOTE, I would have definitely purchased the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2. The difference in the two tablets: the TAB S 10.5 DOES NOT use a stylist (pen), but the NOTE Pro does use a stylist. I asked Samsung if they had an \"after market\" stylist for the Tab S 10.5 and they responded no. So if you want a stylist with your tablet, definitely go with the Note Pro. Other than that, it's a great tablet and an outstanding picture quality and easy to use interface (although do expect a short learning curve if you're going from a PC to a tablet). I also added on the Samsung tablet keyboard (separate purchase) which I really like."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "I suppose I have mixed feelings on this tablet....first the good:: brillant screen and resolution, colors are vibrant, and it is brisk and quick with lots of memory....as well as micro SD slot to add more. It feels substantial in my hands and with a case, easy to hold. I do not like the placement of the \"back\" button and folders button.....it is too easy to accidentally hit it when using the Kindle reading app. No good way to hold it in the portrait position while reading. I have had one dreaded moment after owning it a bit over a month, opened it and it was dead !!  Wouldn't come on, zilch, zero. And it had been on charger all night, tried different charger, different plug, everything. My hubby is more of tech person and he had to repeatedly do a reset [holding down the power and volume buttons repeatedly trying many different ways, figuring we had nothing to lose]  One hour later and Finally......the tablet booted up......home screen and it appears that a software update [didn't say what kind other than it was a Samsung Software update] was ready to install. I clicked Install and now the tablet operates as normal. But now I no longer trust it. I lost an Asus transformer in this same way.....woke up one day and it was dead to the world, and has never breathed since. So I will be reluctant to trust it without constantly backing up photos etc. and probably will not use it with confidence now. That's just my experience. If I will to purchase again, I think I would go with something that doesn't have so much of this happening.....I would go with an Ipad Air."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "I currently own a 2nd generation Ipad which is getting old and slow and I hoped to replace it with the Samsung Galaxy. he tablet arrived quickly thanks to Amazon's great shipping and the first thing I examined was the build quality. While it doesn't have the aluminum case like the ipad I was still impressed with the overall build and feel of the tablet. When I powered it up the display was awesome!. After connecting to my network the tablet requested to download an update and that took about 3-4 minutes to complete and lo and behold it was now running Android Lollipop! I now had a chance to run the tablet thru it's paces and the first thing I noticed was the lag! I was replacing my old ipad because of the lag and here I am with a brand new tablet which had more lag than what my ipad 2 had! I tried surfing the internet using chrome , firefox and Samsung's own browser and the experience was not good, a lot of jitter and hesitation. Touchwiz which is Samsung's own overlay just plain stinks in my opinion and uses up way to much of the systems resources and seems to be designed more for advertising Samsung's products than providing the user with a good experience. Overall other than the beautiful display I was not impressed with this tablet at all and even with the price markdown I don't think it was worth the money so I returned it after one day. I'm back using my old ipad and to be honest even though I'd love to buy an android tablet I don't see any of them that can compete with the overall horsepower and user experience of the ipad. The Nexus 9 has build issues and Samsung seems to be more interested in locking the user in to a power hungry overlay called touchwiz, if I wanted that type of experience I would have bought the Amazon fire tablet, the whole purpose of buying an android tablet was to have the ability to change things not be locked in with a bunch of useless apps you can't delete, or a overlay like touchwiz that slows everything down.

It keeps powering off by itself, despite a 60% charge. Tried a factory reset, still turns off. The battery gauge seems to jump around too. One minute it's 100%, then immediately 20%, reset the device and it lists 96%, then after 10 minutes down to 7%.\n\nMaybe if it had a longer lifespan, I'd give more stars.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "I purchased this as an upgrade from my Motorola Xoom 2 10\" tablet. I decided on this tablet after recently purchasing the Galaxy S5 phone. Both the S5 and Tab S share the Lollipop Android operating system and I was happy with it (mostly) on the phone, so .... The Xoom 2 is (STILL) an awesome, bulletproof tablet and I would have stayed with Motorola but they no longer make tablets.\n\nSpecs are available everywhere so I won't go into them except for what I really like - or don't.\n\nPros:\n\nGorilla Glass face - just like the Xoom 2 and extremely durable.\n\nDual quad-core processors and 3GB of memory - neither Google nor any of the app developers are EVER going to learn to program efficiently so progressively more bloated resource sucking apps and operating systems is just a fact of life. This is BTW the ONLY reason I retired my Xoom 2. :(\n\nSuper Amoled Display - amazing, absolutely amazing. I do digital photo processing so I'm used to quality display hardware. This is pretty impressive for a tablet or phone.\n\nPower save/ultra power save - actually works (somewhat of a surprise). The Tab S has two CPUs - one is 1.9Ghz and the other is 1.3Ghz. Both modes switch down to only the 1.3Ghz CPU - which makes a significant difference in power consumption. A side note: the 1.3Ghz CPU is still pretty robust. There's almost no difference in performance for me between normal power and power saving modes.\n\nBattery life span - pretty decent for a tablet with this much horsepower and screen.\n\nRecharge time - is really good compared to my Xoom 2. Not as fast as the S6 phone, but just as fast as the S5.\n\nmicroSD card - which the S5 and Tab S still have a slot for. Both the 64GB Samsung and Lexar ultra cards I use worked great.\n\nCons:\n\nThe built in, 'hard', buttons - hate them. I like the Xoom 2 'buttons' that were displayed by the OS in the bottom right of screen and followed the orientation of the tablet. So, what if I'm left handed and want it in portrait mode? Or what if some retarded developer decides the 'top' of my tablet is the opposite of the way I want to hold it? This is a big fail for Samsung IMHO. The positioning of the 'buttons' also makes it awkward and irritating to use in portrait orientation.\n\nBloat-ware - which Samsung is notorious for on their devices. I agree with many reviewers - very nice device overall, almost ruined by the ton of useless crap installed at the factory. Some of it is removable by the user, some can be 'disabled', but some you're just stuck with.\n\n5Ghz wireless - busted. In all fairness, this is an Android problem I believe and not Samsung. Lollipop 5.0 has issues in this area. It'll work for some people and not for others and it might work one time and not another. Interestingly it worked perfectly after upgrading from 4.x.x until I rebooted the Tab S. If you really want/need 5Ghz DON'T upgrade to Lollipop until they get this fixed. 5Ghz Hot Spot worked flawlessly on 4.x.x.\n\nSSL/TLS security in Lollipop - used to created encrypted connections between the host and client, such as HTTPS, secure SMTP and IMAP. I won't get into the stupidity involved here. Be aware if you are connecting to older mail servers using secure SMTP and/or IMAP that protocols have been removed from the Android operating system - the factory email client WILL NOT work. There are tons of posts from people trying to figure out why they no longer can connect to their mail (\"Cannot connect to server\") - this is why. There is really only one solution if you're connecting to really old mail servers - don't upgrade to Lollipop. 4.x.x doesn't have this issue. If you're connecting to moderately old mail servers, the K9 mail app will work as it uses its own libraries apparently, and not the OS libraries. Something to note: if you're using a web browser to access old 'out of band' equipment (like HP RILOs), old broad band routers, etc. via HTTPS, removal of 'insecure' protocols will make the devices inaccessible.\n\nAndroid's increasingly obscure system menus - Episode V. Lollipop. Again, not entirely a Samsung issue. If there is ANY way to make it more difficult to find something, it seems Google and Samsung will do it and excel. Can't wait for Episode VI. :(\n\n16GB internal storage AND Lollipop 'save/move to microSD' changes - so its great that it'll accept big microSD cards especially since the 32GB Tab S is insanely expensive. EXCEPT - changes in Lollipop restrict moving a lot of data from internal storage to the microSD card making it almost useless unless you just want a place to put your music, videos and photos. IMHO, nothing but a way to make you pay an inflated price for extra internal memory you otherwise wouldn't need. Hmmmm. Can anyone say S6? On a fresh device with the half a dozen apps I use regularly + Navigon w/ three states, no music, video or pictures, I was down to about 3GB of internal storage. After moving every app I could to the microSD, it was up to just slightly less than 5GB of free storage. Storage aside, this change also affects how apps can store data on the microSD - such as, they can't, or only some, and what happens to that data if the app is uninstalled - in the case of one of my apps, you loose all your saved data if the app is uninstalled. Note: A very large chunk of the internal memory is sucked up by Samsung's bloat-ware.\n\nTouchWiz launcher - I figured this out before I read all the complaints on the forums. Resource sucking pig. There are better written, faster and more useful launchers on Play Store and that is a good thing because this one is pretty sad.\n\nEnd of the day, the physical device is very, very nice. The Lollipop operating system, however, is largely more of a pain in the rear end than its worth. Battery life and performance are MODERATELY better under Lollipop but those are the ONLY two upsides to this OS. I would strongly recommend sticking with 4.x.x unless there were pressing reasons to upgrade.\n\nFor those much more technical, one positive of the Tab S: since this is such a popular device, there's a lot of documentation on 'rooting' the device and the process is simple and relatively painless. While I REALLY had hoped not to have to go through this on another tablet, it turned out to be the only way to get rid of all of Samsung's and Google's bloat-ware and free up internal storage.\n\nIt took about three weeks of rebuilding, reloading, restoring, uninstalling, installing, a generous amount of rubber chicken waving and a lot of cursing, but what I ended up with as a clean, very fast, very nice tablet that I enjoy using. Which is what Samsung SHOULD have released in the first place. I really WANTED to give this tablet five stars, but there is NO WAY I should have had to go through this much time and effort to finally get a useable product. I gave this four stars because the hardware really is VERY, VERY nice and well worth four stars and went quite a way in making up for - at best - the questionable OS and software."}

The screen is so incredibly gorgeous that it makes my Tab 2's screen look totally washed out. It's also a ton more responsive thanks to the increased processing power and built in RAM. From a performance and display standpoint, there's nothing not to like about this tablet.\n\nAlthough the soft home button took up screen space on the Tab 2, I do miss it somewhat as the Tab S buttons occasionally get in the way. I've had to train myself to hold my new tablet in the correct orientation when holding it vertically to prevent accidentally touching the home buttons. It's a minor annoyance but some people might find this frustrating.\n\nAlthough it's nothing to complain about, it does feel like my Tab S runs through it's battery slightly faster than my Tab 2 in most situations (I keep both in power savings mode, and the screen dimmed to about 40%). This is despite having a 12.8% larger rated battery (7000 vs. 7900 mAh). What I *am* sure about, however is that the Tab S takes noticably longer to recharge thanks to this larger battery. I do have to take into account that my Tab 2 battery is at least a couple years old, but my Tab S only charges ~80% capacity over an 8 hour night whereas my Tab 2 charges completely.\n\nReally, that's it when it comes down to it - the Tab S is simply a higher performing tablet with the most gorgeous screen imaginable, which fulfills the primary purpose of wanting a tablet. I suggest you test drive all the options out there, but for me, this was the one."}

Never dropped, no spills, not even much use because of constant problems.  Today it won't recover after trying every tip, hard reset, and speaking to customer support.  The sheer number of internet complants with this tab proves to me that there was a problem from the build.  I've read so many poor reviews for Samsung customer service and repair that I'm afraid I'm out $600.00.  The picture quality remains best in the industry.  Unfortunately you only get to see the screen on occasions when it's working properly. Don't waste your money. The best quality amoled screen images in the world of tablets as far as I'm concerned.  The picture and video playback images seem to POP off the screen in stunning detail.  Having said that I do admit I've had problems.  The battery life is short, I've had issues with the tab freezing, issues with turning it off after it freezes (reaserch proved that simultaneously hard pressing both the on/off switch and volume control at the same time did work to power off the tab), and on 2 occasions the display was unstable, blinking on and off insesently which once again required powering off using both the power off button and volume buttons simultaneously.

I have used android phones for a number of years but was worried that the tablets were no match for their ios counterparts. I had used a nexus 7 briefly but was not to certain that I was a fan of android due to the nexus having a small battery and screen I could not get the same apples for apples experience.\n\nI am pleased to report that these fears were not justified; the Samsung galaxy tab S 10.1 not only met but exceeded my expectations!\n\nThe screen is absolutely fantastic, even in the sunlight it still performed well. Battery life easily got me through the day, and matched my ipad when it came to how long it could last when watching videos.\n\nThe android tablets definitely make life easier than the ipad when it came to putting files onto the tablet such as videos, music etc. No need to make use of itunes. Just simply plug it in and drag and paste like a flash drive."}

I would recommend this along with any android type device over apple any day. along with the fact the you can upgrade/change out you memory with microcard SD where as apple you pay 100$ for every 16GB(basically nothing) you want and not upgradable after the fact. hope other find this info helpful in choice of tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "The screen is bright and crisp. I haven't used the fingerprint reader so far as I fear it will not read my fingerprint properly and I won't be able to open it (My skin is very dry and sometimes my fingerprint ridges get messed up) so I can't say how good it is. The tablet seems to have plenty of zip as I've opened multiple windows/apps with no problems so far. I purchased the 10.5 inch because I read a lot of PDFs and wanted to be able to pretty much read the whole page without having to zoom in and scroll around. I also do photography and felt a nice big screen would be a wonderful way to share and show off my photographs. The colorful bright screen should show off my photos very nicely. In fact I was a bit concerned it might be a bit too colorful and bright and not color accurate, but I think it will be fine for the most part and most electronic devices like my smartphone won't totally be color accurate anyway. Speaker sound is very good which is a big plus for me as I love to listen to music and audiobooks. I want to use it for typing brief documents so we'll see how the on-screen keyboard stacks up against a regular keyboard. If I don't care for it I can always purchase a bluetooth keyboard so no worries as far as I'm concerned. For it's size is it's very light. I have to say I think it probably weighs a bit less than my old kindle keyboard which is about half the size. I will be able to hold it up without worrying about arm and hand fatigue after only a short time. The bronze color is very nice and I'm glad I purchased this color. I'm not trying to look like I'm using an iPod. Proud to own this Samsung, thank you. I've only just gotten the tablet so we will see how things stack up over time and if I have any problems I will update this review. Overall for the price I have very few complaints thus far.\n\nAnd now for the few quibbles:\n1. It seemed to take awhile to completely charge the 1st plug in, but then I was also familiarizing myself with it and so I was using power as I was charging it.\n2. The SD card insertion was not easy. It's a very narrow slot and you need to push that mini SD card way in. I used a blunted round toothpick to do the job as my finger, which is pretty small as I'm a petite woman, just couldn't do it.\n3. Not a biggie, but wasn't impressed with the available apps in the Samsung store nor many of the free apps that came with my tablet. Maybe this will improve with time and there's always Google.\n\nI wish they wouldn't load up these devices with apps we can't remove which just eats up valuable memory.\n\nOccasionally I see someone who wants to stick in a larger SD card and see if it will work. Well I tested a nice new 128GB Samsung mini SD card in it and no go so don't go above the 64GB mini SD card. The tablet was able to read it had a 128GB card in it, but it wouldn't write anything to it so it won't work as far as I can tell."}

Many of the apps that come preinstalled are not able to be removed and some prove to be useless since users wish to use other programs that do the same thing as the reinstalled apps.  The preinstalled apps also suck up some of the memory space and unless you go in and manually tell them not to update, they will update and continue to take up more space. Overall, a fantastic product!  I wish I could afford to buy a second one for my hubby!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "I love this tablet and, if it weren't for the battery life and how long it takes to recharge, I would give it 5 stars.  The tablet itself is beautiful, thin, lightweight and works beautifully. I have had mine since the beginning of September 2014, and I have only had to reboot it twice since then (due to errors, I mean). The display is beautiful. The sound is quite good, for a tablet. And now that Samsung has allowed it to upgrade to Lollipop, I can run most of my new apps from my 32 gb SD Card and this leaves me a lot less nervous about running out of memory. Though, I still find the 16 GB HD a bit on the tight side overall.\n\nMy previous tablet was a Toshiba Excite AT305T16. It was my first tablet, but I still could tell how slow it was. And it constantly needed to be rebooted. Everything kept getting bound up on it. Not so with this Samsung. It is quick, it stays fresh, and it just plain performs. Which is all we ask for, right? I will be buying more Samsung products in the future, I think. Those guys really know and deliver quality. Now, if they could just improve the battery and be a bit more generous with the on-board memory.\n\nUPDATE: I have downgraded my review by one star. I have owned this tablet since August of 2014. And, although I still enjoy it, I am now running out of memory and, even though I have a 64gb sd card attached, I am finding it increasingly challenging and frustrating to manage the remaining space. While many of the apps can be moved to the SD card, most of them can't. And the apps themselves are becoming larger and larger overall. And, to make matters worse, suddenly, I can no longer update many of my apps residing on the SD card, unless I move them back to the internal storage first. This is too laborious and time consuming and I haven't found a fix for it yet. Also, suddenly I can no longer move PDF files onto the SD card either. Other types of files can be moved as before, but not the PDF files. Wondering if the tablet performed some sort of automatic system upgrade that may have triggered these issues. When I \"upgraded\" (and I use that term lightly, with tongue in cheek) from Kitkat to Lollipop, the tablet lost some very useful functions. So now I have to wonder why these problems are suddenly cropping up?"}

I switched from an iPad 2 which was over 3 years old and was bogging down for even simple tasks like Gmail. I have not noticed any lag while using it. UPDATE : Some lag when playing high use games\n\nSo far really good. Do get a case of some type."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "I have had this tablet for about a month now and I must say, I ABSOLUTELY THINK IT IS THA BOMB.COM YO! Seriously, this Galaxy tab S 10.5 is so freaking awesome. I have a problem with tablets, my problem is that, in the past, I can never keep one for more than a couple weeks before selling it. I've had iPad airs, google nexus, Sony z tab, dell venue, etc. Every time I get one, I always sell it or return it because I always seem to think of something else I would rather use the money for. Not with this Tab S though. it is so so thin and light. It looks and feels high quality and I'm constantly getting compliments on it at my University where I am a full time student. (And I'm also a 37 year old attractive young looking late bloomer). Any who, I am a total gadget buff and I know my Sh*t. build quality on this Tab S is far superior to that of the tab 4 10.1 and in my opinion, the tab 4 10.1 doesn't even come close to the caliber of this Tab S 10.5. This Tab S 10.5 has an amazing AMOLED screen on it. It blows the IPad retina display out of the water. The colors are so vivid and every time I think k about it I start grinning from ear to ear. Battery life is outstanding as well. I also am so thrilled with all the free Apps and subscriptions and galaxy apps you get with the tab s. This thing is FAST too. I got the Titanium Bronze color and since it orig I wS purchased at Best Buy originally then I was able to get the 32 GB model which is only sold at Best Buy. I also put an additional 32 GB Samsung class 10 micro SD card in my Tab s so now I have a total of 64 GB. I have discovered\nthough that if you use Samsung's Web browser then it is much faster than using Google Chrome browser, don't get me wrong,  home is still fast but the Samsung Web browser is LIGHTNING fast!!! I also bought the Samsung book cover  case for it and I have to admit, I love it! so well put together and the book cover is thin also but protects everything nicely and puts the Tab S to sleep when closed and wakes it up when opened. I also bought the Samsung keyboard case too. it was costly but is so so Divine. The keyboard case is super thin and covers the screen nicely when closed. It's\nalso rechargeable. I also purchased a matte screen protector from Amazon and it was nice but the screen on the tab s 10.5 is too nice to have a matte screen protector on it so I decided to take it off and I then ordered the Skinomi Tech Glass tempered class cystal clear screen protect here on Amazon for my Tab Sand it is freaking beautiful! All I can honestly say about the Galaxy Tab S 10.5 is that, it is AMAZING, I couldn't ask for a better tablet. I'm literally speechless. The only downside about having this Galax Tab S 10.5 is that the girl I'm dating hates it because it gets more attention than she does from me and frankly, I could care less. I would dump her ass in a heart beat before I ever get rid of this tablet. That's how much I like this thing. And that's the truth. Also, the side sync feature on the tab s which pairs with my S5 phone is da bomb. My phone pairs with the Tab S and all the sudden I see my phone screen pop up on the tablet. I can answer phone calls from the tab, text, play music, do pretty much anything on my virtual phone screen on the tab while I am doing other stuff on the tab. LOVE IT"}

Firstly the screen is beautiful it absolutely is the best looking and vivid colored screen I've ever used.\nThe performance is pretty solid too, just a few hiccups with samsungs touch wiz which leads me too the cons about this tablet. It's all about the bloat ware. Samsung sadly has bundled this with crap you cannot remove or disable. Sure you can root but I'm not interested in that. But I can say the bloatware does hit the battery life a bit too much.\nGranted I run it with just the basics enabled but I could see a full power user who wants everything on live widgets while syncing a lot would not be too happy about that battery use being wasted on apps you'll never use.\n\nOverall I'm happy with my first android tab"}

Just remember Samsung has a history of not updating their tablets and they release tablets almost every day.  Good support from XDA developers on custom roms to keep devices base OS updated.\n\nMost pro reviewers don't think there is a need for multi tasking (watching vids and surfing net at same time) on tablet.  I disagree and love that you are able to watch a movie and surf the net at the same time.\n\nI also had a Surface Pro 128Gb tablet.  The surface pro had benefits of an i5 processor but on the tablet form factor it was lacking.  It was thick, ran hot, and the fans were loud.  Pro's on the surface pro is you can watch the free version of Hulu, watch network videos on their website, etc.\n\nI highly recommend this device.  2K video playback is wow!  You have to see it for yourself.\n___\n4/11/15 Update:\nI notice the iPad Air sleep function utilizes much less battery power than the Galaxy Tab S.  Will see if there is a WiFi setting on the Tab S to minimize power loss.  Maybe the iPad sleep function turns off WiFi or something."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "If you haven't seen the screen on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5-Inch Tablet, you're really missing out. It's incredibly vivid, pixel-dense, colorful, and downright gorgeous. Apple's very best displays pale in comparison to this stunning technological wonder.  The pixel density is greater than that of the top-of-the-line iPad Air, and the huge boost in pixel density finally brought the sort of pixel density and Super AMOLED screen to the full-size tablet market that the then-groundbreaking Samsung Galaxy S3 introduced to the smartphone world back in 2012. Just as the Samsung Galaxy S3 wowed the world and crushed iPhone 4S sales, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5\" Tablet is clearly superior to the Apple equivalent. This sweet tablet is thinner, lighter, more sleek & attractive, more pixel-dense, and has a brighter, more vivid, better-looking screen than its Apple equivalent.\n\nThe only thing Apple's iPad Air does better is satisfy die-hard Apple fanboys who would prefer to pay way too much for an inferior product. You heard me, Apple worshipers (Yes, I know many angry Apple fanboys will give me one star for my opinion. Says more about them than it does about my review).\n\nWhile I was a late adopter, buying mine in March of 2015, I do not in any way regret my decision to purchase this incredible tablet. It will clearly be a good purchase even after the next-generation tablets are released, presumably later in 2015. This tablet is a definite keeper. It is blazingly fast, it looks incredible, it is light, sleek, and the display is second-to-none. And since it accepts 128GB microSD cards, its 16GB internal storage isn't really an issue. And now that Amazon is selling it for $50 less than I paid (at the moment of this writing), if you can afford a tablet costing over $300, you'd be a fool to choose anything else over this, unless you REALLY need a 12\" Galaxy Note Pro, or you're smaller, and prefer the smaller-scale Galaxy Tab S 8.4\" Tablet.\n\nYou won't regret this purchase, unless you buy into the 'Apple is better even though it's inferior and costs more' hype. Samsung does smartphones AND tablets better than Apple, looks better doing it, and uses their technological superiority to expose Apple's rotten core."}

It has a beautiful screen. My one issue with it is the placement of the buttons. I read a lot on it and even after months I still accidentally hit the buttons and either exit out of my book or pull up the menu when I'm using it vertically to read. On my old tablet the Samsung galaxy tab 1 the bottoms were on the screen and flipped to the bottom when I was reading. That was much better. Other than the button placement I love the tablet.\nUpdate: I've had this tablet over a year now. Everything still runs great and quickly. The battery still lasts a really long time. The screen still looks great and has not scratched even though I have no screen cover. I do have a case though.

I thought I has found Valhalla.  So when I knocked my note off my bed, and bent it in such a way, that I could no longer push the volume rocker, or power buttons, I was really in a question.  Should I buy another note, even though it is an OLD technology now, or get this tablet.  This one won the contest, and I am so glad that I HAD to buy this.  Because I would have waited for the next note, if I could have.\nBut the 10.5 AMOLED display, is just breathtakingly beautiful.  And the fact that it does not have a backlight, makes where you could turn up the brightness.  And still not use as much power.  That is, if you wanted to.  The display is SO very vivid, that any more brightness hurts.\nAnd as far as the stylus goes.  It was the whole reason I has this dilemma to begin with.  The dilemma, about whether to buy this tab, or a note.  It turns out that the Wacom Gen. 3 Bamboo Stylus Solo, is a rubber tipped stylus, which is as slidy as a micro fiber.  I think it is great.\nOh, and as of this date April 1, 2015, I have already gotten the lollipop update.  And boy, it has made the little stutter disappear.  Sure, it might have only been a couple hundred micro seconds, but now it is gone, completely.  And battery life is great.\nSo, this is my favorite tablet yet.  I got this, and an otter box, so that broken tablet thing will not happen again.  Great stuff."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "Very much a mixed bag. I've long used an iPad, and for most purposes, the Samsung Galaxy is markedly inferior. Web rendering is remarkably terrible -- basically useless for surfing graphics heavy pages. I read the newspaperwith the iPad, which is quick and responsive; on the Samsung, by contrast, page loads are slow and labored to the point that its just an irritation. This is true both of Chrome and Firefox browsers.  Wifi eats battery particularly when signal is poor. Samsung crapware makes for a decidedly shoddy feel compared with an iPad.\n\nFor one purpose -- the reason I bought it -- its better. I use it at the gym to watch videos, and for this purpose, its better than the iPad. The screen is beautiful, extraordinarily saturated and bright, and with VLC player (not available on iPad), it can play a much wider range of videos compared with the iPad-- MKVs, AVIs, stuff that on my iPad I had to transcode with Handbrake. With cheap expandable storage, you can more cheaply assemble a nice media library, and you don't have to go through Apple's awkward iTunes interface to get files onto the tablet.\n\nSo: very good at one thing, but an unpolished and inferior experience in other respects."}

It was so beautiful right at the time when I opened the box.\nPro:\n1. Gorgeous display, watching movies on this is awesome and the ipad air is no match for this.\n2. Compact design and good build quality. I was so surprised at how light weight this tablet is. The build quality is exceptional for a plastic tablet.\n3. Multi windows and Side sync work great.\n4. Decent camera\nCon:\n1. Lag and stutters appear frequently. The GPU has a hard time catching up with that monstrous display.\n2. Long charging time. It usually takes 4-5 hours or more to charge.\n3. Lack of tablet optimized apps (Not Samsung 's fault. .ask developers and Google for that)\n4. The price\n5. Outdated SOC\n6. No firmware update at this time...I mean Lollipop.\nHaha..it seems like a lot of cons but most android tablets out there all have these problems. But still of you are so tired of the ipad, this tablet is the best Android can offer."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "Five stars for looks. I'm suprised to find myself the old guy telling you it might not be for you.\n\nWell, I finally bought it.  And I ended up taking it back in < 30 days. He asked me if there was anything wrong with it and I said no. He asked if there was anything I didn't like about it and I said \"We aint got that kinda time.\"\n\nI'm in my 50s going on 30s and work on PCs all day long. Not office stuff but nuts and bolts applications and database programming.  Electronics is my thing and shopping for the best tablet was my goal. This could be it, but I could not make it any further.\n\nI've been brought to 2010 by my Samsung smart phone. Many apps and still more available.  Quick access to webmail if I need it and internet if I\nreally, really need it. I draw the line at texting. If I had the Galaxy Tab S I could find the killer app for me. Link it to the phone and I'm cooking with gas.\n\nAt the current discount and with the insurance I got away for just over $600. Then it starts.\nFree magazines!  No thanks.\nNo, it's Free!  No thanks, really.\nHere take some, it's really free!  Get away from me!\n\nGot a coupon for Wall Street Journal, free for a couple months, see if you like it. Thanks, I will.\nNo, Wait, first you have to subscribe for a year to get the free part. No thanks, the same deal is available elsewhere.\nWSJ is not the only one. Everything you click on takes you off to spend money.\n\nLet's link to the phone.  Oh, you don't have the latest model. Here why don't you order one.\nI like my current phone, there must be another way to link.\nNo, perhaps you can tether it, if you had the tether cord, let's order that.\nCordless tether, from the Google play? other problems.\n\nRead a book! Now you're talking. Sit on the train and skim through a giant book using a slim tablet. Magic Mountain is terrific, a classic. Got the\nPDF as a sample for the app. Then just as I'm getting into it I find typos, words are wrong now and then. An alternate translation?\nNo, I'm informed that PDFs of books now-a-days are not made with much care. I should not expect much accuracy since they are not making any money on old books, just new ones. How silly of me, 16GB, Bluetooth, world satelite calibrated goodness and I'm expecting accuracy.\n\nStumble into a hot spot outside of home and it starts again. More selling, intruding, persuading. I just need to check this and that, not hit the\nmall. And the apps! Could not find serious tools to do more than hold a pajama party (virtual!). The nice tight phone apps look cartoonish in this\nsize. Fischer Price applications at Bang Olufsen prices.\n\nAfter another $150 for the screen protection, manicure tools and miniature keyboard I'm typing into a beautiful screen that is trying to be a laptop. I'm sorry, you are not. It has apps just like MS Office! No! They are nearly like it. And what work could I really get done on a sub minature laptop.\n\nWent to see about writing better apps.  Read all about the programming environment for Android. Went to download it and - News Flash - The system is new now. None of what you read applies anymore, all gone, all new environment and ideas. Not even Microsoft does that (often). So go on and Root the device, be a man. Take it down to the very core processors. For what? Once I void the warrenty then I'll find an app to make it useful?\n\nReality Check: I have friends who show houses and sell what they can't carry around using tablets and that's great. Me, I work in an office at a desk with the important parts in my head. At home I type on real keys at a desk into a real screen. The work is in my head. This thing would have been a ball when I was a kid, wasting my time in front of the TV, but that's all it is, kid's stuff.\n\nSo, I'm too old to spend money everytime I turn a page. Too old or busy to endlessly configure useless toys. And way too tired of ads\nunder every last rock. It felt like I was overdosing on Amazon with every breath, except there was more advertising.\n\nI'm sure those reading will respond with the many apps, ideas and recommendations that will make me wish I'd kept this (beautiful) thing. Please do! And no, I wasn't ticked there were no coupons for catheters. One day I may get one more powerful for half the price (next month) but for now I've just plane had it up to my gums with this advertising machine, its fashionable toy accessories and the endless parade of ever fleeting drival that it demands I endure."}

Response is oftentimes similar to my high end tower pc when surfing and switching between screens.  I wed this unit with the Logitech keyboard case and they work seamlessly together.  Printing remotely via Bluetooth is easy.  Arranging of similar app icons is a nice feature.  I have also used the tablet to cast movies to my large flat screen tv using Chromecast.  Very easily done.  The tablet comes with Hancom apps that allow you to use docs and spreadsheets as if it were in Microsoft Office.  As far as email is concerned it works seamlessly for multiple accounts.  The only frustration is not being able to save emails by separate folders (e.g., family, friends, etc.).  However, that same limitation exists with my Galaxy S4 telephone.  Being able to set up folders may be possible, but I haven't found a way yet.  There is no USB port, but I knew that when I purchased the tablet.  However, there are other ways to transfer files. Overall, the tablet is a wonderful choice and tool."}

One thing to know, though, is that since the resolution is so high, some games that haven't been updated to work with such a large capacity screen will look a bit 'thin' due to this. You'll love watching videos on this tablet and the sound quality is really good as well for a tablet.\n\nHaving Samsung move the charge port to the side allows it to charge much easier. The battery life is superb due to the massive size of it! It does take a while to charge if you aren't using a 2.1 amp or higher charger it will take a while."}

The only minor complaint I have with the device is that the orientation some times lags and I suspect it is due to the slower processing power compared to comparable version of the ipad. It's still very minor and only something you'd notice having spent time with both devices.  Even so, if given the choice again between the two I'd still probably end up picking this."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "After months of research, I landed on this tablet as the android tablet with the best reviews. As an iOS user (but not some crazy fanatic) I decided to give android a try to see what it was like to be unburdened by the iOS. If I had reviewed this two weeks ago, I would have told you I *REALLY* liked it, and I would have given it another star. Five stars? No. It simply comes with way too much bloatware for that (2-3 web browsers, two email apps, etc.).\n\nThe three stars comes in because of this: In the last two weeks the thing has become wacky. If I run stitcher, or any other audio driven app (hangouts, skype), and then close the app from the home button with a swipe, it still runs. I can still hear my podcast, my call, etc. I have to literally go into the backend and manually force stop the application. The workaround is to ensure I stop the podcast/end the video call, etc. before closing the app, which sometimes helps. On my iPhone however, I can just swipe to end these with no issues. The other issue we've run into is the internet has started getting clunky and slow - regardless of the browser we use. I thought it was our wireless at first, but all other devices in the house run fast (two regular non-apple laptops, my husbands android phone, and my iPhone). To be clear - we do not have a ton of apps weighing own the tablet. It's actually pretty light-duty.\n\nThese two things do not totally kill the experience for me. Truth be told, electronics have pro's and con's. I was simply led to believe by massive research that this had fewer con's than others. It's more frustrating than anything else. For what we use the tablet for, and the price we were able to get it at (cheaper because of an amazon promotion we had), we're likely going to keep it.\n\nOverall:\nFor light-duty tablet users: You should be okay. Just be aware it might get a little wonky sometimes for no discernible reason.\nFor heavy-duty tablet users with lots of tablets or constant streaming/gaming: You might get a lot more frustrated with these quirks.\n\nEDIT: We ended up sending this back within the return time frame. We bought an IPad and played with both for about a couple weeks. We ended up staying with the iPad and have no regrets. The tablet just kept getting wonkier as time went on and Samsung customer service wasn't super helpful."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "I purposely waited for 4 months to post my review. It's easy to love a new purchase. It's later that you start to notice the flaws in a product. Fortunately I can say that this product is nearly flawless. I use my tablet everyday and it has not exhibited any problems. The display is truly beautiful and its networking is excellent. It never fails to connect o my network. I would like to address the charging issue that some reviewers complained about. It does charge slowly when connected to a USB port BUT if you use the supplied charger it only takes a couple of hours to reach 100% charge. Charging has never been an issue and I find that I can use my tablet for about 2-3 days of light use before I need to put it on the charger. I added a SanDisk 64GB SD card to my tablet. The ability to add this huge additional storage is one of the reasons I went with Samsung. The other reason is the beautiful display. I also am able to back up my storage locally by simply connecting to my Windows computer. The tablet appears as two storage devices, one for internal tablet memory and one for the SD card.\nIt is sad that I almost did not buy this tablet because of misplaced bad reviews. I have not had screen/operation lag problems. I have not had charging problems. I have not had any networking issues. Mechanically the tablet is stiff and the fit and finish are better than almost any tablet I looked at. I am not bothered by the bloat ware because I have the extra 64GB of storage. I did not buy Apple because I did not want a closed and controlled product. Android gives the user more flexibility. Also I do suggest that the 10.1\" display is the way to go. I never find myself wishing that my tablet was smaller. I am very satisfied with my Samsung Tab S."}

It's fast, no lag with multiple apps running. If you've used a Samsung before you can easily disable and hide all of the \"bloatware\" that other reviews complain about.  And between Google Play, Samsung Apps and Amazon Apps there is little gap between the apps available between the Samsung  and Apple.  Everything works as advertised, the battery is fantastic. My wife is an avid Apple fan and she can't keep her hands off this tab.  She loves it."}

In terms of sheer performance, however,  it runs beautifully and continuously validates my decision not to run with ios. Not sure why there are so many reviews indicating that Chromecast constantly misbehaves... thus far everything is running as it was designed to."}

I was leery about moving the person from an Apple iPad to an Android tablet, but the issues were minimal, mainly because e-mail had a different look.  She primarily uses YouTube, Netflix, and e-mail.  This tablet was one heck of an upgrade.  So, why didn't I get her another iPad?  GPS.  WTF is wrong with Apple to exclude a GPS in it's tablets when there are so many location-based services nowadays?  Sure, I could pay extra for the cellular iPad model, but why? And storage expansion.  I moved All of her photos and videos to a flash card and put it into the tablet, which included all of the photos that couldn't fit on the iPad.  Here's some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- GPS\n- external storage slot\n- thin, light, beautiful looking tablet\n- vivid screen\n- wireless AC\n- Android is very customizable\n\nCons:\n- Samsung crap-ware is installed\n- need to replace Apps if migrating from Apple\n- other people want to use the tablet too\n\nThis tablet was an awesome upgrade and gift for an elderly parent who easily adapted to the new operating system.

However, I would not recommend this tablet, or any other android tablet with similar storage capacity, to anyone that wishes to purchase multiple large apps. Android does not currently allow you to move an app completely onto the sd card. It will move some types of data, but will leave a large portion of some apps on the device memory and will not allow the removal of some apps that come with it. This lead the tablet storage to fill up too quickly and I was unable to install all the apps I wanted. I actually ended up returning it and purchasing an ipad instead with a larger capacity. Great tablet for streaming movies, browsing the web, listening to music, and other basic functions. Runs apps perfectly, just lacks storage management capability."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "When my aging Nexus 7 (2012) started to lag, I decided it was time for an upgrade. I really wanted the Nexus 9 but after receiving four defective units. I thought, maybe, I'll try something else out. I went with the Samsung Tab S 10.5 because of the hardware and brand. I ended up buying one on eBay because it was cheaper.\n\nScreen: (5/5) 2560x1600 Super AMOLED display is by far the best looking display I've seen on any tablet. Blacks are deep and rich. Whites are bright white. The colors have been said to be over saturated and exaggerated giving it a real pop effect, but that's what I like about it. If you don't like the over saturated look, there are other display modes available. I can't stress enough how much I love the display. No back light bleed at all. The different modes are as follow:\n\nAdaptive display - the tablet will automatically adjust the color depending on the situation\nAMOLED cinema - the most saturated of the displays\nAMOLED photo - slightly less saturated but still has a nice pop effect\nBasic - no pop effect here but colors are accurate and clear\n\nBattery: (4.5/5) In mix use of gaming, web browsing, checking emails, youtube and netflix - I can get between 7-8 hours of use and that's with brightness cranked at about 80%. The battery is solid.\n\nSoftware: (4/5) Android KitKat with TouchWiz (Magazing UX) overlay on top. There is the occassional hiccup now and then but nothing to get alarm about. I don't particular care for the added bloatware Samsung has preinstalled on the tablet. You can't uninstall them. You can only disable them so they are not taking up additional resources in the background.\n\nHardware: (5/5) Build Quality is top notch. The back is a hard rubberized plastic with a dimple look. It is easy to hold for long periods of time due to being so light. And it's so thin, too. It's just amazing how they managed to pull it off.\n\nSpeakers: (3/5) There are dual side firing speakers adorn this tablet. It's great that the sound is in stereo but the quality and volume isn't the best.\n\nOverall: (4/5)\n\nIn conclusion, Samsung has done an excellent job of creating a premium tablet that really is capable of competing on the same level with Apple's Ipad. If you are in the market for a high end premium Android tablet, look no further. You won't be disappointed."}

I'm honestly looking for something bad to say about this tablet, but I can't. So much features I don't know where to start.\n\nI'll give you a basic run down of this tablet:\n16G of memory - and you can extend it with a micro SD card.\nDual task screen - basically, you can have two apps open at the same time and multitask between the windows.  Right now, I'm listening to Bruno Mars on YouTube as well as typing this review. Purely amazing. However, you can only multitask with the apps they allow: e.g. youtube, Google Chrome, Internet browser, email, Gmail, the gallery and music, Google maps, Evernote, and a few more. You can't play a game or watch Netflix while using the multitask function.\nThe pull down notifications bar is super handy. You can see your notifications as well as alter the brightness of the screen and the volume of byte tablet as well as some other tablet features. If you really want a more detailed description of what you can do on this tablet I suggest you youtube it.\nIt's super light so my hand never gets tired holding it... but not light enough where I feel like I'll break it.\nLike the Samsung s5,  this tablet has a fingerprint detection security feature.  So awesome !!! I have all of my right hand scanned.\nSuper vivid screen,  and the speakers are good quality.\nspeaking of good quality, the  cameras are also high quality.\nI bought mines for about $400 with tax, and I have to say I have no regrets for buying this yet. I Can tell that this tablet was a great investment. Good job Samsung!"}

The virtual keyboard works much better than any of my other touchscreen devices, and not just because the keys are larger.  The response just seems to be very smooth.  After a couple of months of use, the only (very minor) dislikes are that the charge drops quickly and recharging seems slow which might just be the way it is for tablets of this size and capability, and the fact that I keep accidentally hit the revert selection on the bezel while reading pdf files which then dumps me out and loses my place.  Wish it was possible to temporarily inactivate that (virtual) button."}

It was always underpowered, I had to keep clearing apps off to keep it from getting too sluggish to use. I tended to like the smaller 7\" size, but decided I wanted to upgrade to a 10\" tablet. I compared stats to some of the others, and decided to stick with Samsung.\n\nThis is an awesome tablet! Plenty of power, amazing display, but most of all it takes a micro SD card, up to 128gb. so many devices any more don't offer an SD card option, which is a shame, and one reason (of several) I'd never choose an Apple tablet.\n\nUnfortunately, the version of the Android OS at the time didn't allow apps to write to the SD card (meaning they couldn't create or delete files expect in their specific installation folder.) They're supposedly going to backtrack on that in 5.0 Lollipop, I hope so, it was a pretty bad idea in the first place. But that wasn't the fault of Samsung, so no stars taken away for that.\n\nOverall I'm very happy with the tablet. Highly recommended!"}

Beautiful screen, rich and vibrant colors. It is very thin and stylish.\nHowever there were serious negatives. The lag is unbearable on this tablet. I owned an iPad Air prior to Galaxy Tab S and in comparison, the iPad user interface is more responsive and you feel in control of the tablet. While using Galaxy Tab S, the user interface feels almost rubbery. There is notable delay in everything you do on this tablet. This was the killer... There was also an issue with losing Wifi connection while Bluetooth was enabled. I had to dig in Android user forums to realize that this was a Samsung software bug that involved the Sidesync feature. When Sidesync was enabled, and bluetooth was enabled, Wifi connection would drop and reconnect, and would drop again. This made the tablet unusable. I called Samsung tech support that was based out of Philippines and was told that there was no such problem reported with the tablet, even after I pointed the tech to the Android forum post that described the issue. My case was escalated and several days later I received a phone call from a Samsung engineer stating that this was not a known issue and the recommendation was to do a hard reset of the tablet.\nI kept the tablet longer than expected, trying to like the device, and when I tried to return it, Amazon third party seller refused to take it back. The tablet was sold on eBay...\nSamsung... Make the lag go away. Fix the software bug with Sidesync. Make your customer service people and tech more responsive to clear evidence of software defects..."}

You can't do that with an iPad.  You have to buy a new one.  The one thing that I absolutely LOVE is how brilliantly sharp and colorful the screen is.  Nothing can compare to it.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 phone and it automatically links with it with the SideSync app.  We also have a Samsung smart TV and I was told that it will link up to that as well.

I didn't love it because it didn't provide all that much utility and the screen was good but not great.  The Amazon app store was way more limited than the Play store.  Fewer apps worked on it than my android phone.  I had to side load a lot of stuff I really wanted (which all worked fine BTW).  I hadn't touched another tablet since.  Until I picked up this Tab S on black Friday.\n\nAll I gotta say is WOW.  I went from model A to Ferrari.  This thing is so fast, fun, amazing, beautiful, capable etc. etc.  I stream my TV to it with a Vulkano device, I surf the internet with a Google Chrome browser, I watch movies from my NAS, I take full advantage of Amazon Prime video.  It does everything I want and it does it well.  I could not be happier.  That is my happy emotional take on the product.

I could not be happier, best tablet out there. Best thing gone with the IPad is the junky keyboard layout. That is just the tip of the iceberg as far as what makes this a better tablet. I can't see what people see in Apple products I purchased my wife an IPad then one for myself should have got a Samsung then, if I only had known and not listened to the hype. The OS on the Samsung is so far superior you can't put it in words. Transferring files using I tunes is awkward and time consuming. There is no need for this with this tablet OS and you can transfer files to the SD card. All the operations are easier and more user friendly. Oh did I say how happy I was with this great Tablet?\nThe build quality is second to none and very attractive. Samsung should put the effort into accessories like Apple does for the IPad that is my only complaint. The battery life is excellent better than my IPad was.\nI guess all I can say after reading some of the major reviews is I can't find anything worth saying is bad. Some reviews say this or that is not customizable,  and I scratch my head, have they EVER even used an IPad which let's you change or customize NOTHING. An IPad compared to this tab looks like it belongs in preschool just compare for yourself. And as I type this review I am reminded how superior this keyboard is to an Apple keyboard, it's nice to once again have all the features on the keyboard oh how I missed the simple little backspace key which is not available on the Ipad.\nIf you want to impress the Apple geeks get an IPAD if you want a GREAT tablet get the Tab S 10.5 you won't go wrong with the Samsung.\nOne more comment, and it's about user friendliness the Samsung is hands down more user friendly than an IPad."}

The screen on this one (the AMOLED) is nothing short of fantastic. Some people are a bit put off by its being so vivid, but I consider this a plus. It is remarkably light and runs all day on a charge.\n\nI have not found any problems with it at all. Some have complained about the fingerprint reader being to finicky, but this is a trade-off for security - and you can always leave it off or just use a password. The audio sounds good for such a thin box, but since I use bluetooth headphones, it would not be an issue in any case.\n\nBottom line - I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this one - particularly if you can pick it up on sale..."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "The S 10.5 is better overall than the iPad Air and costs a lot less. I had an iPad 3 32GB for 2 1/2 years which I sold.\n\nThe display is better than the iPad Air's. I put a 64GB Samsung micro SD card in it. Try doing that in an iPad. The \"Recent Apps\" and the \"Back\" buttons make it much easier to use than any iOS device. I can connect it to any Windows PC, it shows up as a USB mass storage device. No more being a slave to iTunes or the few independent Windows programs that allow you to move files but still need iTunes running in the background. There are some apps that are iOS-only but there are actually superior, free Apps on the Google Play store. A free calendar app in the Play Store has the same features as a $20 in the App Store. There are a number of free apps that can access the internal features and sensors in the S 10.5 that are forbidden to iPad and iPhone app deveopers by Apple.\n\nThose complaining about battery life and performance: Turn off all the Apps you don't need that can be disabled; Turn off all unnecessary notifications that can be turned off; If you have lots of Apps see which ones can be transferred to the SD card; Enable \"Developer options\" in \"Settings\" (Google it) and disable the three \"Animation\" settings; Disable S-Voice and Google Voice. I charge the battery every three days or so, it seems to use about 16-17% per day with heavy use. The batteyr life seems to be very similar to that of my old iPad 3.\n\nOne negative is that the Samsung Simple and Book covers do not totally disable WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth when the cover is closed unlike the iPad. Although this turns off the display and put the device into standby the three functions are using battery power.  So I just disable the three functions in the \"Quick settings\" bar when I put the device away each night."}

It runs all of the apps I like, without getting bogged down & stopping or lagging.  I love the fact that you can use two apps at one time (can't tell you how handy that has been!).  I have enjoyed some of Samsung's past tablets, but this one is the best yet (IMHO)!  With the combination of great speakers & a bright & clear display, it makes watching Netflix and Hulu better than watching TV.  I can't tell you how many family, friends, & coworkers who have asked me to let them play with it, and they then say that they want one.  I have been using the tablet at home & at work, and it does everything that I have needed it to do.  And the battery life is pretty good!  I am SO happy with this purchase!

When you factor in tax, my Amazon purchase was $44 cheaper than Best Buy ((big grin)).  Overall, I love Sammy! (That's what I named it...don't judge).  I'm a Note 3 user so the learning curve for me was very low.  The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because I get annoyed that the menu buttons don't work the same as my phone.  To me, it's not as easy to maneuver between applications. Secondly, the Samsung Rep told me that the word processing application on it was as good as Microsoft (maybe I haven't figured it all out yet...but so far...not so much.  It opens the document but the formatting is a mess.). Overall, it's a very good product!  Great battery life. BEAUTIFUL display. I have conserved so much of my cell phone battery by using the tablet instead to surf, scroll on social media, and play Words with Friends :)  So, if you are like me... meaning you just want to be cool and get a tablet like everybody else--you want good performance but will basically just use it leisurely b/c you have a PC/laptop AND cell phone w/ data--you don't wanna spend a fortune--but you also don't wanna to be cheap about it...then get this tablet :-)  It satisfied all of that for me."}

I like Samsung products generally and have a Note 4 and a Nexus 10.  I was hoping this would be my uber upgrade for the latter.  The screen is the best I have seen on any tablet and I have tried all of the better tabs.  But even with its high-end specs, both of the Tab S tablets have lag and stuttering performance almost constantly.  I got in the habit of killing all background apps frequently, but the performance is just not smooth.  I don't know whether it is the hardware/screen interaction or a software issue, but it gets annoying after a while.  I hope they get it worked out next year because I would love to have a tablet with this quality screen.  But for this iteration, I think three stars is fair.\nEdit:  I grab another on sale.

I can drag and drop files from my desktop, and view/delete files on the tablet.  I installed a 128GB Micro SDXC card and have tons of storage.

My biggest complaint is the battery life. I play clash of clans and it doesn't out last my wife's 2 year old iPad or her sisters iPad mini. Guess you can't win them all. However the charging cord is way longer than the iPad's so I can plug in with ease and I still get a kick out of watching my wife plug in drop cords when her iPad runs low a few hours later. I'm also not a huge fan of the keyboard so I'll probably be downloading another one soon. The device is so awesomely wide that it's awkward to reach the middle keys with my thumbs and I've got pretty large hands as well as other parts of my anatomy. It would have been nice if it included the split keyboard option that I used on the ipad. The Google voice features are the best I've ever used, the iPad had the same thing but it wasn't quite good enough for me to get into the habit of actuality using.\n\nThis was pretty much my first order from amazon and all and all shopping at amazon was a great experience however this tablet was poorly labiled. I wanted to buy a tablet that could be setup on my at&t data plan so I would have to survive off wifi. However nothing I could find in the product details said anything about it. I called amazon customer service after i placed my order and the nice lady I spoke with also couldn't tell for sure if it would work with at&t, but she assumed it would work with any carrier since it didn't say. I figured she was probably right since at&t sells them... but we were wrong and it only has wifi. I'll probably spend a little more and shop somewhere that I can make sure I'm getting what I want next time I buy expensive electronics or if I have the patience take advantage of their return program, I'm sure amazon would let me swap it out if I went through the trouble."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "This tablet uses the SAMOLED display which is used on GalaxyS phones so the viewing angle, colour and efficiency is inherited. To understand you have to see it yourself. In the dark, you won't even be able to see the screen where it is black, this is because amoled screens don't use any backlight, and you could read alot of ebooks on this thing if you switch to white on black background since all the black pixels is essentially OFF.\n\nNow, the Exynos Octa is not a true Octal-core cpu, infact it's two seperate cpus, one at 1.9ghz and another at 1.3ghz, but only one can run at a time. This is supposed to translate into power effeciency. Although technically this specific Exynos 5420 can support HMP where all 8 cores can be assigned something to do, it is not enabled on these tabs. The LTE version uses a different chipset, the Snapdragon which beats the Exynos model in many ways especially GPU performance where the Adreno 330 outshines the Mali-T628MP6 by a good margin. So if you plan to play games on this thing or want a faster model, then the LTE one is the way to go. So far though, I haven't seen any 32GB in LTE, only Wi-Fi and exclusively only from Bestbuy which is where I got my 32GB Wi-Fi model from. It's also worth noting the LTE version carries a heftier price tag, so you may or may not want to go for that model.\n\nI have rooted mine and installed custom firmware and overclocked and undervolted both the CPU and GPU but it still cannot come close to the LTE one in terms of GPU horsepower. 2.1 GHz on the A15 cpu up from 1.9GHz and the GPU from 480Mhz to 667 Mhz. The boost was very noticable in some games for the GPU, but keeping the CPU at top speeds for long is not really possible even with DVFS disabler and wanam exposed installed to mitigate the downclocking features. My antutu score for this device has reached 40,000 points up from the stock 35,000 or so.\n\nI recommend nova launcher to speed things up too. Also worth noting is that internal memory is significantly faster than memory cards, so you'll want to install your most frequently used apps or games on the internal 16 or 32gb and only put media like videos, mp3 or other things on the SD card. When I checked internal memory was about 64MB/s write vs only 15MB/s write for the external sd card (Samsung 64GB Pro).\n\nIt does get quite warm when gaming though, right by the camera in the back. It also takes a while to charge, and uses the smaller USB2.0 connector instead of USB3.0 like some other tablets. There is also a darker colour scheme under the name Charcoal Grey instead of Titanium Bronze available in some markets."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "I absolutely love this tablet. I have been looking into getting a tablet for some time so that I can save my laptop for strictly school stuff. I did a lot of research and looking around before I decided on a Samsung, which was a front runner choice from the get go because I have had a Samsung phone for years and I absolutely love those as well. Originally I was looking into a different Samsung tablet and my significant other and I were in store comparing a couple of different ones when we saw this one for the first time and WOW, we were blown away by the display, we were sold on it right then and there. After reading some of the reviews posted here I had some concerns but we purchased it anyway because it had everything I was looking for. The option of being able to expand the memory was a huge selling point for me. The sound is much better than I was anticipating and after having watched a few shows on the tablet I am more than pleased with it, not only for the sound but the picture and the smoothness of it, it loads video's effortlessly, unlike other devices I've used in the past. After having the tablet for more than a week now I can say that I absolutely love it.\n\nSome of the concerns I had such as the battery life have proven to be unwarranted concerns. Some prior reviewers made comments about the battery life leaving something to be desired but it holds battery better than I was anticipating. In all reality it's like any other electronic device, if you're going to be using it all day long, expect to have to plug it in, it's no different than a smart phone or a laptop, I actually have to plug the tablet in way less often than my phone or my laptop and I have been using all of them considerably. When I received my tablet it had 64% battery life and I used it a lot the first two days to mess with setting and get everything how I wanted it and it took almost 2 full days to die. While in standby mode overnight it didn't lose any battery percentage and it charges pretty quick.\n\nAnother concern were the haptic touch keys as some reviewers found they got in the way. Personally, I haven't had that issue. I have a samsung smart phone so I am used to those keys, perhaps that's why I have not had an issue with them. In all reality, if you know where they are and you're paying attention to what you are doing, they won't pose any issues for you."}

I finally migrated from an iPad 1.\nSuper fast\nScreen is its differentiating factor. The colors and clarity are amazing. I watched a movie and could see the pores on someones skin in one shot.\nWafer thin, almost like a cracker. Makes one feel like it should be handled delicately its so thin.\nSamsung's UX interface won't let you opt out to run the stock Android interface but I got used to it. If you start deleting all the home pages its OK. It will force you to have one. Otherwise its seems like some Windows 8 tiled BS that can give you a headache sorting it all out.\nI learned after purchase the 10.5 version does not have a proximity sensor so you cannot wake it without using the home button. But there are apps to remedy that.\nBattery life is good given the power hungry screen.\nHowever, the charge cycle is slower than expected. If you have a Note 3 etc. don't expect the same charge cycle with this tablet as its slower.\nI use this for productivity and work i.e. reading when I don't want to sit at a desk, Going through 10 to 15 PPT slide decks a day etc. Entertainment is secondary. This will serve your needs for both."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "I am writing the review on it right now.  It's a beautiful device.  It runs well and you can watch amazon prime movies on it.  You do have to go through a bit of searching to figure it out.  It doesn't run on kitkat without the amazon apps that you do want to get from Amazon.  They  are  free.  Also you can use flash players but you do have to get the apps for that as well, also free.  I did my research before buying so I knew this was the top of the line tablet, including  processing speed and a 3 gig ram (fastest of all tablets)  to be honest,  I am waiting for the android programmers to write a rooting program so that I can store it away.  It is such a great computer and I use go launcher ex on it so it does whatever I want it to.  I have no intention of rooting it for a couple of years when it will still be a great computer but will want to play with other operating systems. Oh and with dolphin browser you can set up a desktop version instead of a mobile browser which makes it accessible for websites not set up for it.  My sons both have Linux computers,  we'll I made them that way. Android is my favorite operating system and look forward to all of apps that come out.  My only complaint is that you have to agree to all licencing in one place.  I do not want Google Drive and can not refuse it.  One reason to root it.  Google Drive does not allow alternative sites of  applications because of the contract.  I like to see what is out there besides Google play.\nI changed the rating for two reasons. The first is there is no v way to actually repair the screen without paying close to getting a new one. The glass and the LCD are both offered separately but you have to buy it assembled no matter  how minimal the damage. To fix mine  would cost over $300. It is only cracked glass but it is sealed to the digitizer. So I have a broken tablet that cost about the same to replace. I would have never bought it if I would have known that\nThe other is that it doesn't have the ability to use a digital stylus. Great screen, perfect for pdfs but you can not annotate. That was the only feature I felt it was lacking before I couldn't repair the screen."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "Overall this device is worth the money. However, the specs are not the best for a tablet of 2014. The specs can be looked up in the item description. I currently use this tablet with a smart case, but I believe the tablet can be given software updates to better improve the battery life. From my use, the tablet uses the light sensor as well as the smart cover detector to detect when the cover is opened, this probably uses a good amount of power.\n\nThe device comes with many amazing features that are worth the money. Upon receiving the tablet and installing it:\n100gb of DropBox for 1 year\n1 Year of Evernote Pro\nSplit Screen\n\nThose are the main features that this tablet is best for. The screen is also very nice and appealing to the eye, however this tablet comes with no stylus or anything other than just the tablet plug accessories. I give this table 4 stars due to Samsung's excess programs installed on the device, most cannot be removed and the lack of updates to fix minor bugs found throughout. Hopefully, this device will support Android 5.0 Lollipop and the overall use will be better."}

I've bought cheaper tablets in the past where I've had to be careful to hold it on the edges, lest the screen begin to flex.

It is also very fast and responsive most of the time, i downloaded two games that would \"challenge\" the tablet and there was no lag or slow down. A few other pros worth mentioning is battery, wifi range, a few stock apps actually useful(MyFiles app to write to sd card until lollipop) Multi Window(works with some third party apps like Dolphin browser) and Fingerprint scanner which was a surprise because many reviewers complained it was inconsistant.\n\nA few negatives is bloatware(i turn them off so I atleast don't have to see them) which leads to the second con, memory, 11gb is usable after preinstall software. I'm getting a 128g micrd card for it though so the internal can be used for apps.

It's superior to WQXGA display in color saturation, depth of black color and overall brightness, which make the tablet best suited for watching blu-ray/HD quality movies. Initially Super Amoled was widely used in Samsung smartphones rather than tablet. The first Samsung tablet uses Super Amoled was tab 7.7. I wrote a review on that one when it came out. Unfortunately, the tab 7.7 had very limited release in the US. Using Super Amoled display on tab S model, a full size tablet, provides highest level of viewing pleasure to tablet users if their main usage is to watch movies.

Was told, \"Oh yeah, you can save your documents to the micro SD card.....\"  W R O N G ! ! !\nI spent the money buying a 64g external SD card, try to save my work, and SCREEEETCH, get error message:  \"list of files saved in external storage may not be displayed due to Android write restriction.  to display the list of all files, select all options under the settings menu.\"  So then I can't find the danget setting to see if i could do something to allow storage to external SD, so out of frustration from not finding setting I go to the local electronics store.  Guess what I'm told?  That the word processing program from Samsung doesn't allow storage to the micro SD card, that there have been complaints about it, and maybe in the future Samsung will get the message and allow their program to save word files in the micro SD card.  WWWHHAAT!!!  If someone has figured out how to save word files to their micro SD in their Samsung Tab S,  PPP-leeez let me know!\n\nEverything else about the Samsung Tab S is awesome, but this one thing erks the heck out of me, especially cause I was told prior to purchase, \"Oh yeah, you can save your work in the external SD....\".

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "What sets this tablet (and Tab S 8.4) apart from the rest is the AMOLED display. While it looks amazing, there is a quirk concerning its power consumption. Simply put, it will consume a lot more power on a white background, and will consume very little on a black background. This is why a lot of you will experience the battery drain a lot faster while browsing the web (which tends to have white backgrounds) and will see the battery drain a lot slower when watching movies (which tends to have darker backgrounds).\n\nOne way to save the battery life dramatically while browsing the web is to turn on some kind of night viewing mode, in which you change the background to black and turn texts to white. Below I outline a way to do this using FireFox and applying a global color theme through an add-on.\n\n1. Download FireFox from the Google play store and install\n\n2. Run FireFox, click menu->Tools->Add-ons, and select Browse all Firefox Add-ons\n\n3. In 'Search for add-ons', type 'Stylish' and select the first item (Stylish). Click 'Add to Firefox'. Select 'Restart'.\n\n4. In FireFox, go to menu->Tools->Add-ons and select 'Stylish', and click 'Manage Styles'. Click on 'userstyles.org'. This is where you choose a color theme that suits your needs.\n\n5. There are many themes that you can choose from. Search for 'global' for instance and you should see some themes that darken the background. Some themes that seem to work well are 'myfavolours - global custom color scheme', 'Midnight Surfing - Global Dark Style' and 'Global Style - Pitch Black Firefox'. Select a theme and click 'Install with Stylish'.\n\n6. To manage the themes you installed, in Firefox go to menu->Tools->Add-ons->Stylish and click 'Manage styles'. Here you can disable or enable the themes you installed. You probably don't want to enable multiple themes at the same time.\n\n7. After a theme is enabled, go to any website and notice how the colors have changed. Because the add-on is making custom changes to every website you visit, it may look a little weird depending on the website and the theme you are using. You can experiment with different themes to see which suits you best."}

It is a compliment to Samsung that this tablet so quickly integrated into my home full of various Samsung, LG and Sony appliances that it was actually a non-event. The graphics capabilities are incredible and though others may complain regarding Samsung's overlay of programs and 'bloatware,'  it actually compliments the selection of software that came on my Samsung Note 4 phone.  The tablet is super-light in comparison to the Kindle 7' that it is replacing.  So far, I've been able to go nearly a full day on battery and that's just crazy when you see how thin and light this tablet is, and think about the size of the screen.  Finally, 'you really cant beat the price for what you're getting.  I got mine for a little over $300, which was over $100 less than the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 that I nearly purchased.  Galaxy Tabs have been getting critical praise since they were introduced and this tablet is an example of why that is so.  Hats off to Samsung."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "I have owned several Asus/Samsung tablets before this one, and this is by far the best Android tablet to date.  My usage is about 10% web/email, 10% reading ebooks, 40% watching movies and 40% gaming.\n\nScreen:  This is it's best feature by far, 25% more resolution than any iPad, and the ability to use it in the sun, which is not even possible on a ipad, or for that matter 90% of other android tablets. Absolute gorgeous screen that typically has people peering over my shoulder asking which tablet I am using.  Movies simply look awesome on it.\n\nPower/speed: Probably not as snappy as an iPad Air, but it's really close.  I know some users have complained it's a bit laggy for certain things, but it's barely noticeable for me.  Maybe I have just gotten used to it.  But compared to any other Asus/Samsung tablets, it is noticeably faster.\n\nBattery:  Very good when compared with most other android tablets.  I get about 10 hours on 30% brightness just using it for email and web.  When gaming I get about 5-6 hours on the same brightness.  Charging is not the best, it does take about 4 hours to fully charge from about 10%, and you can't use other cables, only the one it came with.\n\nBonus:  Love the freebies they threw in, specifically 1 year of free GoGo internet in-flight and 50GB dropbox space."}

I read a few mediocre reviews when it first came out so I decided to wait because the price didn't seem to match up with the features. That was until Amazon had a $50 off deal for the 16 GB version last weekend, I jumped on that instantly. I read a bunch of reviews afterwards and realized I made a mistake, I canceled within an hour.\nThe screen (the most important part for me) wasn't great, light bleed, bad color.. and 4:3???? Not enough storage, and no SD.. or OTG. That makes no sense. Poor build quality. No extra features beyond the awesome processor and Lollipop.\n I read post after post from disappointed Nexus fans like me, they had returned their Nexus 9 within days and bought the Tab S 10.5 and couldn't be happier! I've never owned a Samsung product. TouchWiz turned me off instantly. I hate bloat, I always root my devices and flash custom roms so I don't have to deal with it. But strangely I feel no need to do anything with this tablet. It's been fast and smooth for the 3 days I've owned it and I've tried to push it hard.\nThe screen is absolutely amazing! Best I have ever seen. I find myself using it over my laptop just because the screen is so nice to look at. I mostly watch videos and read stuff on the Web with my tablet and the screen is perfect for that. Build quality of the Tab S is also top notch. It feels good in my hands, light, thin, and the back is nice and grippy. Then you add in features like the fingerprint scanner, the IR blaster, SD card, and the amazing battery life, and you've got yourself an amazing freaking tablet! So happy with my purchase!"}

While I am still getting into using more of the Tab's capabilities, I'm liking it more with each use I find for it. I've just begun using the Hanscom Office apps (calc and documents) and find the learning process a bit bumpy - I keep looking for the mouse cursor. However, I do believe I will be able to satisfy my limited needs with this and a few of the other apps. I'm not so much into the social and music stuff but I do find it very satisfying as a Netflix or other video tool. Nice screen size and real decent speakers.\n\nAll in all, I am very please with the device, from its size, performance, features and appearance. The only gripe I might make is the battery sorta needs charging daily. I use it typically 3-5 hours a day and have had it warn me once the second day of very low battery. It is not a big thing for me and I did read that the battery was a less than stellar feature before I purchased it.\n\nI bought it with the IVSO keyboard and think the combo is a great match. I would have to say I would purchase it again knowing what I do after having used both for several weeks. So in the short form -  I would recommend it to anyone.\n\nWhen I feel totally comfortable with my learning experience I would probably give it a 5-star rating except for the battery issue. Still, I feel it is an excellent Tablet."}

This disappointment revolves around one key point: Battery life.  This little baby has all of the great features that are touted with this version of android, fingerprint scanner, etc.  And the display is soo beautiful.  But don't expect anything less than maybe a few hours of battery life no matter what you do.  I watched mine go from %51 to %39 in 3 minutes while sitting on the desktop, bluetooth on, wireless on, adaptive brightness and doing nothing else.  No background download or application download.  This was a factory reset system with just my google account logged in.\n\nso I contacted Samsung and they said that this was normal behavior and sent the tablet back to me.\n\nThank you Samsung.  You have made it easy for me to completely boycott your products despite my long-time use of them and recommend that no one use any of your devices after this service experience.  DON\"T BUY THIS TABLET!  You will be disappointed just like I was.\n\nitamazonian at gee mail dot com.\n\nP.S.

Right out the box you notice how light the tablet is which is great. The titanium finish goes over nicely as well. Next the speed of the tablet. Super fast to connect to wifi and download speeds are fast as well, but the biggest selling point of the Tablet are the Screen, Battery Life and overall Fuctionality. From watching movies, surfing the internet and playing games rest assured that the tablet handles it beautifully. All of your favorite features come over to the tablet as well.

Then I purchased iPad Air, which was a lot better, at least at first. Then when the iOS 8 update came, it was terrible... apps lagged, WiFi connections dropped all the time, and it ended up being a really frustrating experience (not something I'd expect from Apple).\n\nI thought I should give Galaxy Tab S a try. Glad I did. This is a really great tablet, and my initial fears that only some of the apps that are available for iOS will be available for Android were unwarranted - I was able to find the Android versions for almost all of my apps.\n\nThe screen is absolutely stunning, mercy, it is gorgeous. I'd say it's better than the Air's. It's an AMOLED screen, which means incredible colors, contrast, and it's definitely not lacking backlight at all.\n\nNow does the tablet lag? Not really. Well, okay, it does sometimes. But when it starts to stutter a bit, all I do is reboot it and it's fine again.\n\nI use this tablet for playing games, watching YouTube, browsing the web, and reading old comics and books.\n\nIf you can't decide between iPad Air and Tab S, I'd say get the Tab S. Definitely recommended."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "I purchased the Galaxy tab S with the intention of trying it and comparing it to my iPad air.  My thoughts was that if it didn't impress me I would return it.  Upon arrival,  and after package removal, my first impression was positive.  The device itself is much thinner and lighter than the Air.  Upon startup I was impressed with how quickly it became operable.  Initial setup is a breeze, and it seemlessly restored the apps I was using on a Samsung Galaxy Note.  The molex screen is incredibly bright.  The device manages memory well, using approximately 90% so apps load quickly and without hesitation. The finger print scanner works flawlessly,  it's a nice feature.  Android has always been very customizable,  so it beats the iPad there. Having the option of adding storage via SD card is unbeatable,  and that's where Samsung beats apple again. It aggravates me to no end that Apple forces you to upgrade the device if you need more storage.  Svoice has finally matched Siri.  The only area that this tablet didn't beat the iPad is in battery life.  I have to charge this device more often.  It has a power saving mode, and an ultra power saving mode.  The ultra mode puts the screen into monochrome and gives you Internet and email access. This extends battery life tremendously.  If you are somewhere without the ability to charge and need to use it, it's a great feature.  I use it while the device is charging,  and it cuts down on the time it takes to reach full charge.  Multitasking is easy with Android.  If you're using the email app and you click on a link, it divides the screen in half giving you both the browser and the email, this is a really nice feature.  The device has better sound when using the speakers as well.  Placement of the speakers let's you hear stereo separation better.  The cameras, both front and back are a touch sharper than the iPad. If you have a galaxy s4, you can connect it to this device for seemlessly integration.  So I have decided to keep the device and since it's arrival I have yet to use my iPad Air."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "After destroying my laptop with a cup of water in the spring I have been debating on the decision to buy a tablet or to buy a new laptop. Given the price of this tablet I could have easily bought a core i-5 laptop with much more memory and a huge hard drive and video capability. I also own a Galaxy S4 and so I wanted a tablet that was at least as good in the hardware spec department, and that really limited my choices.  Since the S4 has an 8 core processor and 2gb memory, the only tablet that fit the bill of being better in performance for me was the Tab S. (or the 12.1, but for that much scratch I would have bought a core i-7 laptop instead)\n\nI found what I would consider a good price at a membership club starting with a C. When I unboxed it, I was surpirsed at how thin and light it actually felt, because when you check these things out in the stores they have all sorts of security wires attached, making the tablet feel like it weighs 5 pounds instead of 1 pound. The color is really really nice considering everyone else is only black or white. The rear of the tablet also has a textured pattern and some sort of coating that gives it an anti slip feel. The button layout is where you would expect them to be, but the speaker placement leaves something to be desired. Yes, there are two of them but they are in the sides vs the front, and they really aren't that loud, at least in my experience so far.\n\nI had been used to the HTC Sense OS from previous smartphones, but really like the user interface of my S4. the Tab S is not only as good as my S4 but even better as it has more customization as far as what appears on the home screens. Upates, widgets, etc are all there for you to touch away at. Setup was a breeze and the tablet even started importing apps for me when I logged into my google account. Within a half hour almost every single app and contact that I had was now on the tablet. Everything, including my calendar sync'd perfect. the tablet recognized both my 2.4 and 5ghz wifi bands as well.\n\nOnce I started using it I was blown away. The screen resolution and color was absolutely amazing, even at 50% brightness. WiFi streaming my television shows from the Time Warner app was seamless and they appeared just as they do on my 50\" HD plasma.  the Samsung remote control tv app was equally impressive, allowing me to control the tv and cable box with the tablet as well as giving me a full color tv guide to review what I wanted to watch. Apps start quickly and operate like you would expect. One thing that a tablet has an advantage of, besides screen size is the ability to better show and display web pages. I am experiencing more laptop like viewing and performance of web pages than I do with my phone, which makes it really nice while sitting on the couch. I will say I dislike Facebook because the tablet wants to upsize every photo to fit the screen and it looks crappy on the HD screen. I also dislike the fact that I am having connectivity issues trying to connect my phone to the tablet, even though they both have the same OS and are of the same mfg.\n\nThere are a few games I started playing now that I have the tablet. Rollercoaster Tycoon 4 is one and has given me some issues, but i think it has to do with the app and not the tablet. I mention this because I also play Battlefield 4 commander on the tablet and have had ZERO issues, whether playing at home or even sitting at McDonalds while at lunch and using their wifi.\n\nOverall I give the tablet 4 stars so far and here is a quick rundown why;\n\nPros\n-8 core processor which provides great speed, though not as fast as the new S5 processor. Go figure.\n-Screen resolution and brightness is amazing\n-3 gb memory easily handles the applications you have running\n-Finger print swipe to open works well\n-Included applications work well for the most part.\n-Tablet is light and thin and can handle an extra 128gb of micro SD memory.\n-Battery life so far is great for me\n-Gorgeous and different bronze color\n\nCons\n-Side facing speakers instead of front facing\n-16gb of built in memory. Seriously, only 16? Memory is super cheap these days. Just charge us the extra twenty bucks and include 64 in a five hundred dollar tablet.\n-Included cover is garbage (my tablet came with a Samsung screen cover which is absolute garbage)\n-Only an 8mp camera, where my old model S4 has a 13mp.\n-Hard to hold with big hands\n\nThe cons are minor complaints overall and I included most only because the tablet was origionally in the five hundred plus msrp. One would think for that kind of scratch you would get specs on par with the newer samsung S5 phone. I would also expect that for the price you get more built in memory and better overall hardware, with the camera being one example. My generation older camera has better resolution. Also, because the tablet is so light and thin I am finding that there is only one way for me to hold it with my large hands. that is, with my hand on the Upper left corner with my thumb wrapped around the front top. if I try to hold it any other way, my thumb will ALWAYS wind up touching some part of the screen, which results in something happening which I did not want to happen. For this reason I am ordering a thicker silicone case protector. I do appreciate how thin and light new products are becoming, but at some point ergonomics does become an issue."}

The Amoled screen is amazing, it's fast, and pretty user friendly, if you're at all used to Android.  The battery life is OK, not as good as the Apple IPad (which is what I replaced this with), but still, not bad.  I first tried an Asus tablet for 3 weeks, but the battery drained so fast, I was constantly looking at the battery meter.  There were also a few other things that I didn't like about the Asus tablet, so I returned that and got this, and I am glad I did.  I'm still tweaking it every day to get it exactly how I want,  but I just wanted to write and say how much I enjoy this so far!"}

I love the Android OS (though I did change the launcher to a simple tablet theme), it has SD card slot where I can store tons of movies/shows (for very little extra cost), the blacks are unbelievable (LED's turn off pixels to display black instead of dimming them), the screen resolution going from the iPad's 4:3 to a 16:10 shows so much less black bars on movies and shows, the dual speakers (one on each side) is super nice for showing friends Youtube clips as well. It's exactly what I was hoping for in a tablet, I was not disappointed."}

Do it at slightly different angles and you will have good recognition later on.\n\nIt is expensive, but you get what you paid for. Recommended!!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "It's a fantastic tech tool.\n I'm a veteran IT professional who works for a Health IT company. I picked up this tablet with the sole purpose of replacing the laptop I use for work. Having to do IT work in doctors offices and surgery centers means little space to work in very hectic environment. I needed something less cumbersome than my Dell 15\" laptop. At first I was a bit nervous going from a MS windows OS to Android. Turns out this tablet works out better than my laptop for everything I need it to do and more.\n We can talk about how great the screen and sound are, or how awesome games play. There's no surprise there. What I don't see getting mentioned in these reviews are the abilities of the Tab S with a few small accessories. Like purchase a Micro USB to standard USB adapter and now you're able to access any thumb drive or portable HDD.\n My favorite attachment though is the USB Ethernet adapter. The tablet let's you hardwire a network connection. That ability with the right apps, has allowed me to do all kinds of network troubleshooting and mapping, even cable testing.\n I've seen a bunch of reviews and comments that talk about the battery life, I can honestly say I have absolutely no complaints about the life of the device. I'm able to sit with my S5 in sync with the pad speak through the mic and speakers on the pad, while running remote connections through logmein, and split screening my company's ticketing app. As well as slide in a couple min between tickets to play some games. And at the end of an ordinary 10-11 hr day my Tab S is still rocking around 35/40% juice. I have to admit I am a stickler for app management though, I don't let apps just run in the back ground. The Tab S makes app management ridiculously simple to!\n And it never changes temperature, it's the weirdest thing. I can feel my phone get hot after use, but this thing never gets warm! like even slightly. I've joked about it being \"Alien Tech\", but it is a very \"cool\" (Ba dum cha) feature.\n In my line of work I get to see plenty of Apple, Microsoft, and Android products in use. And between the networking, VPN, and EMR software compatibility issues from the MS Surface line. And the countless compatibility issues Apple has being forced to play in the Microsoft sandbox of the business/professional world. I have been very pleased by the performance, capabilities, and compatibility of my Tab S."}

The interface is smooth, screen is amazing, and extra ram all combine to provide a great user experience. The Samsung apps are quite good, and security is acceptable for business use.\nI was initially concerned that the 16GB internal storage, but it has not proven to be a problem. The only thing I can add (and it is a small issue) is that you cannot format your SD cards as NTFS as they will not be recognized. FAT and ExFAT are fine. This is a minor annoyance as I like to use the cards in my Vizio and Samsung Smart TVs, and neither of them recognize ExFAT so if you are dealing with files larger than ~4GB, you will need to have more than one card.\nIMHO, Samsung finally hit a homerun with this Tablet!"}

I bought a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard to use with it and it has been fantastic all around.\n\nIt runs quite quickly, especially after decreasing the animation time in the developer options.  Even with multiple apps running or with multiple windows up it remains quick enough for me to do whatever I want whenever I want.\n\nAs has been said by many, the screen is simply fabulous.  I love watching movies and netflix on it.  Also, my textbooks look fabulous on it and are easy to read.\n\nMost of the games that I have played on it have run smoothly.  This includes games like Bard's Tale and Final Fantasy.\n\nThere really is only one thing that subtracts from the greatness of this tablet.  Whenever I use Sidesync, I run into a wifi problem that simply will not go away without a factory reset.  The Wifi connections would continually go in and out of range, and it would be unable to connect to them.  A  wifi only tablet is useless without the ability to connect to wifi.  It took  me a few weeks to discover that it was sidesync that caused it.\n\nAll in all it is everything I expected it to be and I foresee using it for the next couple of years.  I just won't use sidesync.\n\nUPDATE:  I have had the tablet for about 9 months and it is still great! I use it on and off everyday and charge it every 2 to 3 days.  The update to Android 5.0 went smoothly although it changed hardly anything.  I am still able to recommend this tablet."}

I've spent several hours with both netflix and Samsung support  doing the same ineffective remedies - force start,reload ,power off , reconnect wireless-without effective resolution.

(The Pro 16,32, & 64gb micro SD cards have the faster transfer rates. The 128gb is slower) Large photos stored on the sd card come up very fast.\n\nI have to say I absolutely love this thing.  My home office consists of a Linksys WRT 1900AC, an HP wireless 5510 scanner/printer, an HP LaserJet Pro 400 m401dw, and a backup drive connected to the router.\n\nAll the printers are accessible from the tablet including the scanning function of the 5510.  Utilizing the app ES File Explorer, I can access the router back up hard disk, download and upload files and photos. Using \"nearby devices\", we can transfer files and photos, between my TabS, my Wife's TabS, my Galaxy phone, and my Son's Tab4.\n\nI deleted the Hancom office \"viewer\" apps, and through Samsung's free app store, downloaded the full versions of Hancom word, spreadsheet, and power pt. for free.  They seem to function very well reading and writing to Microsoft Office files.  My documents are fairly simple, so I can't speak for complex word docs, and excel spreadsheets.\n\nThis TabS has replaced an Asus Netbook running windows, and can do everything I did on the netbook, only better and faster.\n\nI have nothing to compare battery life to, but I find turning down the brightness, turn off location and bluetooth can save battery.\nThe keyboard is a chick-let type keyboard, and is the same size as the netbook keyboard but more comfortable and solid.  It also folds up and acts as the cover.\n\nOver all, I really like this TabS and the accompanying keyboard.  I have nothing bad to say about it."}

The AMOLED screen on this thing is large, has excellent color, incredible contrast, simply great.\n\nThe frame is also nice. it doesn't have the unnecessary \"chamfered\" edges like Apple or HTC products. It is smooth metal. The cover is nifty as well.\n\nIt can be expanded with an sd card.\n\nThe rest of the tablet is not so great.\n\nMy biggest problems with this tablet come down to Samsung's OS design and placement of capacitive buttons.\n\nSamsung always finds a way to bloat down stock android. The result is that Android is actually pretty laggy here. More so than my Moto X phone. This is probably because of the high resolution screen as well, but it is still slow.\n\nThe worst problem are the capactive buttons. They are right beside the home button, and they are very sensitive. What this means is that you can be using the tablet, and you'll accidentally hit one of the buttons. When I use this tablet I end up doing this many many times. There is no way to disable this \"feature\" in the settings without rooting it, which is another like 3 hours of effort.\n\nLastly, there's an annoying Samsung logo on the face of the tablet which is quite visible while watching movies in a dark room. Minor issue, but one that only Samsung manages to have."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "Many of the reviews here have thoroughly covered both the positive and negative points of the Tab S. I would agree that its features and especially the screen resolution are phenomenal. I noticed a couple of problems, one minor and one major, that I'll comment on in. The minor point is that the manual shows the charger/USB port to be at the bottom of the tablet when in fact it is on the right side as you're facing the horizontally-oriented front of it. The second more problematic issue which I spent several unsuccessful hours trying to solve with tech support is that the fingerprint scanner is inoperable if there is a Microsoft Outlook e-mail account installed on the tablet. Looking through the internet, this seems to be a common problem with some Galaxy phones as well. Apparently, current work-arounds are difficult to implement and may sacrifice security. Come on, Samsung, address the problem. The fingerprint scanner works on the iPhone with Outlook installed."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "Long time iPad user who has slowly been migrating over to Android products the last few years. Decided to give this tablet a shot with an iPad 2 on its last legs.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is how great the screen looks. I've never seen anything like it on a tablet before. The colors really pop and it's almost worth the price alone. The overall design is average.. I've heard some griping over the \"plastic backing\" but I have a case on always so it's never been an issue. It's lightweight and the bronze trim gives it a classier look. Having speakers on each side is nice for streaming media. My main gripe with the design is with the home button being set on the bottom of landscape view. I use my tablets in portrait most of the time and prefer it setup in that manner. It's something I'll get used to but I do tend to accidentally hit the back key frequently. This is personal preference more than anything.\n\nFunctionality wise, it has met expectations. The tablet is fast and responsive. It comes with TouchWiz which I understand has it's critics, but I think they've worked out the bugs in that interface from earlier versions. Regardless, I ran some other launchers and they worked great. Adding an SD card is easy and offers up a ton of extra space for apps and media. The camera is fine for a tablet. I'm still waiting for a company to really put their efforts into the front facing camera for better face to face chats.\n\nI have some minor complaints that drop the score to a 4. First is the bloatware which there is a lot of. Samsung seems insistent on using their apps which often have better alternatives on the market. As well as partnering with companies for many apps that you'll never use. This wouldn't be an issue if I could uninstall them, but they don't let you do that. You can disable them, but they'll still reside on your tablet eating up space. This is really minor in the grand scheme of things, but it's a pet peeve of mine and I wish companies would stop doing it.\n\nThe lack of USB 3.0 is confusing considering how they've thrown everything else at this tablet from a hardware perspective. While I find the battery life to be good, it would be great to have a more powerful option. I guess I'm a little spoiled by the charging and transfer rates I'm getting on the S5 with this functionality.\n\nOverall it really is a powerful tablet. Perfect for those who consume media or play games. I still think there is a learning curve for Android tablets and would recommend someone be a little tech savvy before purchasing one. And there are still some popular apps that aren't designed for Android tablets and look off. That's not the fault of this tablet, but it's something to keep in mind when purchasing. It's a solid 4.5 stars in my book. Just a few minor issues from this being a perfect tablet."}

It was INSTANT love.\n\nAs much as I love Amazon way more, I had to buy it there because they do not offer the 32GB model anywhere else, as that one is a Best Buy Exclusive only. The system storage uses at least 6GB already, you'll only be left with 10 GB or so with the 16GB model; and Android KitKat has some annoying issues with not being able to write apps onto external storage.\n\nSamsung has way too many models out there, but I'm glad I waited because the \"TAB S\" (S must also stand for SUPERIOR!) model is the top-of-the-line LAMBORGHINI of tablets.\n\nIt is fast, but the SCREEN is what completely separates this tablet from all other tablets -- it is ABSOLUTELY MINDBLOWING GORGEOUS. All the tablet screens are put to shame compared to the Galaxy Tab S.\n\nThe Galaxy Note models may have an S-Pen (my Note 3 phone has it), but I will trade that pen ANY DAY to keep this GORGEOUS screen. It blows all other tablets away. Anyone with good eyes seeing the display of this screen will be extremely impressed and be envious. iPad's \"RETINA\" display? Puh-lease!!! That is child's play.\n\nYou can see the pixels and fine detail and the CONTRAST and DEEP BLACKS are stunning. Yes, the blacks are truly black and the colors SERIOUSLY pop. I'm sure you've heard people say that about other LED HDTV or monitors, but this is a whole new level -- when I say the colors really pop and the blacks are super black on this, this is the REAL deal.\n\nIf I had to knit-pick, I would say there isn't much holding area sides, so you may end up touching the display when you don't intend on it (My Nexus 10 has much more holding area); then again, it makes the screen look bigger and keeping the look slim and sexy. Also, it is just a micro-USB port; not USB 3 like the Samsung Note 3.\n\nDon't forget to remove the ugly, distracting white serial number sticker on the back of the Tab S; it almost looks like it shouldn't be removed (I actually wasn't sure myself and kept it on for awhile because I thought that was the only way to identify the model), but it's actually stuck on there so that you can peel it off easily, starting from the right side. The serial number is written on the bottom of the tablet, anyway.\n\nI also recommend getting the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-S-Action-Bluetooth-Mouse/dp/B00N241Y0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung S Action Bluetooth Mouse</a>&nbsp;along with this for more productivity!\n\nI own a Samsung Note 3 phone, so I was already familiar with the multi-window feature; however, it is more useful on this with a bigger, gorgeous screen and I can see myself using it more with this device. Google Maps also looks fantastic as the colors and font is much easier to read and distinguish - I love using this tablet in my car as a navigation! It totally blows away all those expensive cars with built-in navigations.\n\nI am so happy this has a microSD port - with 64 and 128GB microSD cards available now, you can carry A LOT of videos and view them anytime on this GORGEOUS screen. Did I mention how gorgeous the screen on this device is?\n\nThis is the ULTIMATE tablet if you're currently looking for the best. Hands down the best screen out there - no competition. Best tablet for viewing videos/games. This is the BEST tablet."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "I purchased this from Best Buy because I found out I could trade my Samsung Galaxy Note 8. The screen on this tablet is a beauty. I wasn't sure of the landscape form factor because of the buttons at the bottom, but since the power input is on the right side, it makes it easier to handle when charging. The finger print scanner does not work on the first try EVER. It usually takes about three times before I get it. The margin for error is very specific, you can't go to fast/slow and must be dead center when swiping. I'm trying to get used to it, to see if I can get better at it, but my patience is wearing thin.\n\nThe display is AWESOME! The 4K videos on YouTube look amazing, you don't have to turn the brightness high to see everything, everything pops. I feel like I have a 4k screen in the palms of my hand.\n\nThe downside is dealing with some bloatware. Samsung gives you the option of what bloatware to load, but it still comes with more than a few apps. Also, I got the 32GB because I love downloading apps from the Playstore and was running out of room on my 16GB Note 8. Samsung takes up around 6 GB in software, so keep that in mind.\n\nIt does not use the 3.0 USB, it takes a long time to recharge from 0 percent."}

The TAB S does come with a bunch of preloaded software that many people will not want. Getting rid of them is easy, which frees up memory and reduces screen clutter. For those of you familiar with Android, the learning curve is almost zero.  The control buttons are mostly out of the way from accidental pressing, but it does take a few times using the tablet to train yourself to avoid the buttons.  The BIG thing about this tablet is the super bright high-resolution screen. The battery life is excellent. Watching a movie seems to cost less than 10% of the battery life. My preference is not to have the screen at maximum brightness, especially when using the tablet as an excellent reader."}

I bought into all the hype and commercials and was looking for the \"next big thing\" and all I got was a great big headache! The tablet is really slow for a tablet with an eight-core processor (eight brains in one). Maybe they should give at least one of those brains to Samsung because it obviously needs one to figure out how to not make this junk so slow!\n\nThe tablet makes all my pictures look over saturated and cartoony, it make me sick, I don't want cartoon pictures, I want photos of my family and friends that look real and with real skin tones and hair color.\n\nIt's useless trying to use it portrait mode, the buttons get pressed accidentally most of the time and there's very little apps that even support the full screen, facebook? No, facebook messenger? No, FAIL!\n\nI thought I could at least use more google apps by default since this is an android but Samsung has all their apps set to default and you can't delete them! What a waste of space!\n\nThe battery was okay but doesn't last as long as they say (10 hrs), it lasts about 6-7 hours on the web reading and watching netflix. With my iPad Air I get 10 easy even up to 15 -18 hrs if I push it.\n\nI couldn't get the SD cards to work for some reason, not all apps can be saved to the sd card and this tablet only comes with a few GBs.\n\nOverall, the only nice thing I have to say is the screen was bright and the tablet was thin. But my iPad Air was already thin so this tablet was a bad choice.\n\nI learned my lesson, stick to the iPad, I'll get better quality and people who actually thought about the way I use the tablet, even if I have to pay a little more to get it right!!!"}

Initially it was for me until I came to my senses.  Apple's iPad performance reaches a level of quality that Android tablets are held back from by the OS.  Still, the writing's on the wall.  Purchasing this has proved to be money well spent - something I was never quite convinced of with Apple.\n\nI am now enjoying my tablet experience ten-fold over the iPad Air.  It took such a tablet as the Tab S to provide to make me realize that was possible.  iOS may always best Android in terms of quality, but Android delivers the more \"fun\" experience - especially when paired with an incredible tablet such as this."}

I ended up pulling the trigger and was so in love with the tablets screen and quickness that I ended up purchasing another one because I would never see anything like this ever again.  Even better, it was AC technology and my internet is super fast and it makes it more enjoyable.

Many times they left packages in the rain and come later than it is expected.\nOk, now the tablet. I think its fantastic if you like doing photography as the OLED screen is the most beautiful I have ever seen period. No laptop, no TV, no phone looks as good as this tablets screen. Even brighter than my Galaxy Note 3.\nThe finger ID was finicky until I learned a little trick. Dry fingers have a hard time registering and hardly worked for me. Then I licked my finger to get it damp and then it worked ALMOST everytime. So keep that in mind if your fingerprints don't register.\nThe speed is fair for the tablet. Its not a fluid as an Ipad.

Also it plays them in 1080p and that is really great.\n\nOverall in usage don't heat a lot but once you start some 3D game it gets pretty hot.\n\nBattery lasts around 7-9 hours at about half display brightness and mostly web surfing and video playback.\nBattery charges kind of slow around 4 and a half 5 hours.\n\nMulti tasking is almost useless as you can only do that with just few fixed apps.\n\nThere are pretty few pre installed useful apps.\nNot even a simple notepad  i was also  looking for sound recorder but didn't find any.\n\nOn promotion side best things are they give you a free 50 gb Dropbox space for 2 years.\n\nAlso 3-months of Marvel Unlimited but to use that it require a credit card registration.\n\nI can have lived with the some of the performance issues but there is no way can stand all the issues i have with that screen and it's the only reason i really get that tablet.\n\nThere was an software update  after installing it colors get a bit richer but for some reason video playback is not anymore  as fluid as it was before so one of the few things i liked is now gone.\n\nBeing a long time Samsung phones user  i'm very disappointed by this product."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "This is my 4th tablet and by far the best I've owned to date. I've been in the Android ecosystem for a while now, but I do get the opportunity to play with other devices as well and I'm tech savvy. Quite simply, nothing else compares. I bought this mainly for reading, writing, coding, netflix/youtube, and a few games here and there.\n\nThe first thing that has to be pointed out is just how amazing the screen looks. All the colors are bright and crisp with no discernible pixels, no back-light bleed, no dead pixels, and all the blacks are truly black. Absolutely gorgeous in every respect, it's still stunning me every time I turn it on. Everything I've come to expect from an AMOLED screen. The auto-brightness function works well, it's not blinding at night with the lights off and it's plenty bright during the day. Also, the bezel is a bit smaller than my last tablet (Nexus 10) leading to the Tab S having a larger screen but being smaller overall. I have no troubles holding it without touching the screen, so this change is a welcome one.\n\nBattery life has been excellent, far exceeding all my previous tablets. I've got 6 hours of screen on time in the past 6 days and I'm at 34% battery. As with all OLED screens, darker backgrounds and images will increase battery life; I made it a few days with a black background but the gorgeous display looks so much better with a nice vibrant HD wallpaper. Charge times are also quite acceptable. I haven't quite decided if the ultra-power savings mode is a gimmick or actually useful like on the phones. The apps you can use in ultra-power savings mode are very limited, and it's unlikely to be used to contact someone in a real emergency. Only mild amounts of warmth emanate during gaming sessions, the system doesn't seem overworked at all.\n\nThankfully the \"Titanium Bronze\" color I chose is not garish or gaudy. I would have preferred a black or even gunmetal option, but I was pleasantly surprised by the appearance. Also the tablet feels really nice in my hand. The back is the same texture as the GS 5 phone, grippy enough to keep any accidental drops from happening but not sticky or unpleasant. The weight is also pleasing, light enough to not cause strain after hours of use, but not so light as to invite accidents. Though I wouldn't complain if they had tacked on a bit bigger battery at the cost of more weight.\n\nThere are a few minor annoyances, depending on your viewpoint. Samsung does not make the best software, luckily being an Android system these problems can be fixed. I read quite a few reports of TouchWiz causing problems, so the first thing I did was install a different launcher (Nova). Because of this I have experienced no lag at all, except some browser lag on some websites which you will see in every single tablet on the market. Every action is snappy and responsive, everything you would expect for a tablet of this price.  The menu button is now a recent apps list which I find annoying, yes you can hold it and get the menu button but that only creates confusion with my brand new GS 5 having a menu button and my brand new Tab S having a recent apps button.\n\nThere is a little bit of bloatware that comes with the tablet, it would be nice if manufacturers would stop including useless apps that are difficult to uninstall, however they have kept it at a minimum compared to a modern smartphone and you can turn most of them off so they stop using system resources. As a quick example, the NY Times app used 5% of my battery and I never opened it once. You will want to clean up the bloat if you want to maximize your battery life.\n\nOverall, I can easily recommend this to anyone wanting the best of the best."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "Magnificent... OK let me start with my first observation,  and the thing that separates this from every other Android device: BATTERY AND CHARGING.  The battery does not seem to last 10 hours as advertised,  but it lasts long enough about 8 to make this very useful.  Having said thatm considering the display and quad plus one core cpu, 8 hours is awesome.  It's light, it's well thought out with no sharp edges, corners or buttons protruding to catch on clothing etc.  I bought a few excellent cases from amazon for about 10$ each and a 5 pack of screen protectors for same price so I'm very well prepared.  The tab 4 10.1 inch for just under 300 is the bargain as this is still a bit pricey to basically get a souped up screen resolution for 200$ more.  Yes you get a slightly faster cpu and another core but I have not noticed any difference and yes I have both.  How ever when one realizes that class 10 sdxc card is 40$ and adding the up to 128 gig sd card makes the storage larger as one larger disk vs how my phone is where the phone storage is separate from the sd card.  That means I have a faster, higher resolution display, more affordable tablet than air pad and all of it including cases, memory and tax was under 500$.  A 64 gig air pad is 700 plus tax and I can still put up to 128 gig in this where apple has ZERO upgrade or enhancement capability.  This is a beautiful and very fast tablet that will serve anyone welll.  There are untold hundreds of aftermarket accessories for this and Samsung is just getting started.

Without this higher capacity card your limited to the hard to find SDHC 64GB cards I think.\n\nSecond, I really just want vanilla android. I wish Samsung would have an option of removing their bloatware and custom menus.  Just let me install base Android, without the apps I do not want.\n\nOtherwise form factor, screen resolution, and build quality are excellent.  This tablet is better than the IPAD in these respects, and if I could solve the previous two problems it would be perfect."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "This is my first android tablet. I have used iPads extensively for work before, but I have always liked the Samsung Galaxy Note series of phones. All I can say is that this tablet is awesome.\n\nI absolutely love the slidesync feature. Being able to mirror the screen of my note 3 on the screen of my tablet is surprisingly very useful. I also use the teamviewer app fairly frequently, and it works very smoothly.\n\nThis tablet is very light and thin. The speakers are very good, especially when compared to my Galaxy Note 3's sound.\n\nI don't have any complaints. I haven't had it freeze up on me. I have tried to find graphic intensive games, and so far it is perfectly smooth. I would say that the graphics rival an Xbox 360.\n\nUnlike my iPad, the my Tab S never gets hot, not even warm. I have done a video Google hangout for over 2 hours straight, and it was still cool to the touch.\n\nThe battery life on this is amazing, I only charge it about every 2 days with heavy use. The screen is amazing, and the camera is sufficient for snapchat and video chat. I don't use the cameras for anything else, but they are more than sufficient for my needs.\n\nI have used about 65GB of data so far on this thing in less than a month. I barely use my laptop anymore with all of the Google drive apps. Just hook a keyboard and mouse to the Tab S, and you have a little laptop.\n\nI have recommended this tablet to my friends and family."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "This is a fantastic tablet with its super AMOLED display and 2560x1600 resolution.\nI bought this tablet mainly for media consumption, and because Samsung boasted it with a superior display quality that outshines any Android and Apple devices out there.\nAfter I received the tablet, I tried some video comparison with my Ipad 3, Sony Xperia Z1, and my Asus gaming laptop.\nThe result proves that the Tab S is indeed a better device at displaying almost everything. With its higher pixel density (you get a higher pixel density if you bought the 8.4 inch version) and SUPER AMOLED display, its colors were more rich, more flourished, and more toned.\n\nI almost have nothing against this tablet, except for the fact that I think the battery life could do better.\nThe Tab S comes in with a 7,900 mAh battery, which should be a power house compared to most of the other Android tablets currently in the market.\nBut with about 50% brightness and power saving mode, my battery was down from 90% to 50% in 3 hours. Calculating at this rate, the battery will only last a little more than 6 hours going down from 100%. This is much less than the 10 hours of video playback that Samsung boasted.\nI also test the tablet with games. The result was also not satisfactory. The tablet was set on about 25% brightness and 60% battery but it was down to about 20% in a little more than 2 hours.\nI know this result should be understandable because the SUPER AMOLED and the higher resolution should have placed a great burden on the battery. But I wished that Samsung could have done better with their battery optimization so that it could last at least one hour longer. The battery problem especially pains me when I compare it with my Ipad.\nI know in this case the comparison wouldn't be fair because my Ipad features a larger battery, but it is just sometimes annoying when I see the Ipad could last me more than a day and the Tab S is dead by the afternoon.\nHigher brightness on the Tab S really kills the battery.\nOther than the battery problem, I think the Tab S is a great buy and the SUPER AMOLED will not disappoint you."}

I can look at my magazines, read a book, watch movies (for those long 8 hr. drives to the university).  It fits in my purse and does what I wanted it to do.  My husband has it talking to our  computer but he is an elec. engineer and so I would expect that from him. The apps are good, I just wish that I could get rid of the ones I don't want ( like the wall street news) and I don't mean move them to another page. I wish someone would make a case that would also store head phones (the type of slide over the ear and not those stupid buds) and the SD cards that they are all together with the tablet.  Customer service is awesome!!! Got a guy right away ---after my teens had been on it and had \"changed things for the better mom I was told\"---I didn't like what they had done so Samsung helped me change it back.  As a mom who really doesn't like computers because I think to many people over share or say things they would not say in person I really like this tablet!  Oh and the camera is fantastic.

I returned my newly purchased Galaxy Note Pro - which was too heavy and clumsy - to buy this one.\n\nWonderful aesthetics, with a finishing that is second to none. The iPad is a distant second to this. Along with the bronze book cover, this device is astonishing.  I am actually writing this review from the device and typing is so easy with the wonderful keyboard. The bronze colour is a knockout and I would recommend this.\n\nI am holding on to 1star, because I find that's some apps only open in portrait and appears unnaturally stretched. Sometimes you also see some poor colour resolution on the apps and some wallpapers. I hope samsung can correct these with an update soon.\n\nI also wish this came as a Note, to show off all the fancy tricks one can do with the Note devices.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "Android is a very capable operating system. With it, Google accomplished the unthinkable -- widespread Linux use by average home users. Linus Torvalds popularized his kernel with nerds and the enterprise, but the search giant made it accessible for all. Here's the thing though -- the fact that Android is powered by Linux doesn't matter. No, to the average consumer, all that matters is the experience. What lies beneath is inconsequential.\n\nSamsung recently released the Galaxy Tab S 10.5, its newest flagship tablet. The device's closest competitor is the iPad Air -- which is a tablet I love. Besides Apple's tablet, there is really no other product to consider at the $500 price point. So, if you are considering a $500 general-use tablet, the only question that must be asked is -- is it better than the iPad Air?\n\nBoy, what a tough question to answer -- tough, but not impossible. I've been using them both, side by side, for some time now and I have some definitive thoughts.\n\nGalaxy Tab S 10.5 Specs\n\nNetwork -- Wi-Fi Only\nProcessor -- Exynos 5 Octa (1.9 GHz QuadCore  1.3 GHz QuadCore)\nDisplay -- 10.5-inch WQXGA (2560x1600) Super AMOLED, 287ppi\nOS -- Android 4.4 (KitKat)\nCamera -- Rear: 8.0 Megapixel Auto Focus Camera with LED Flash, Front: 2.1 Megapixel\nConnectivity -- Dual-Band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac MIMO, BT v4.0, USB 2.0\nMemory 3GB RAM, 16GB Internal Memory, microSD (Up to 128GB)\nBattery -- Li-ion 7,900mAh (10.5)\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe first thing you notice upon taking the Tab S from the box is just how thin and light it is. Shockingly, at 6.6mm and 465 grams, it is even thinner and lighter than the iPad Air. This makes it very easy to hold and reduces arm-fatigue. Of course, at this point, we are splitting hairs -- both tablets are really thin and light.\n\nIf you are in the market for a 10 inch tablet, the screen should be a huge factor in your decision. For a while, the iPad Air display was one of the best, if not the best. The retina display, while partly marketing-speak, produced beautiful and vivid images. While the display on Apple's tablet is still great, it can no longer be called the best.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab S 10.5 offers a 2560 x 1600 resolution, but that is only part of the allure. The real news is the Super AMOLED technology, that recreates the most beautiful colors and imagery. Some may argue that this technology over-saturates the colors -- I must disagree. True, colors are more vivid, but not to the point of creating a mockery by any means. No, it instead treats the user to a more life-like experience.\nWhere it really shines is in the sun (pun intended). In my backyard on a sunny day, the iPad Air is unusable. It is impossible to decipher what is on the screen, so I must head for shade. The display on the Galaxy Tab S, is a totally different story. Samsung's technologies allow the user to have a better experience under sunlight. This is achieved using sensors that adjust the display to your surroundings.\n\nMuch like its smartphones, Samsung has implemented its TouchWiz improvements to the otherwise boring Android interface. When compared to the stock experience of something like a Nexus 10, TouchWiz makes the user experience much more colorful and lively. Things get taken to a new level with this tablet though, as it takes advantage of a tablet-optimized \"magazine\" mode, which I rather like. Don't like it? Install Nova Launcher. It's not a big deal, guys. Android gives you the option to choose.\n\nThe iPad does not allow you to easily add additional memory. While you can jailbreak and access SD cards and flash drives, under normal usage that is not allowed outside of photo importing. Samsung's tablet offers a microSD slot, so you can add up to 128GB of additional storage on the cheap. While newer versions of Android are making it problematic for apps to use the card, it will work wonderfully for storing media, docs and any other file you want.\n\nThe rear camera on the Galaxy Tab S 10.5 is actually not bad. Should it become your dedicated camera? No. Still, for a tablet, it is quite capable. There is very little noise and shutter is quick. However, the front-facing camera is pretty bad. Pictures come out very grainy, but it serves its purpose as a video-chat camera for services like Hangouts and Skype.\n\nSound on the tablet is remarkable. While not front-facing like the class-leading Surface Pro 3, there are at least stereo speakers located on the sides, that lend to solid stereo separation. The user can actually make out right and left channels, something that can be lost when the speakers are positioned on the bottom or rear. Watching a movie on this tablet is a dream -- the combination of speakers and display make it the perfect Android-powered media tablet.\n\nUnfortunately, and strangely, the tablet uses USB 2.0 for connectivity. I understand that many people are moving towards the cloud and connecting to a PC is becoming a rarer occurrence. However, why implement USB 3.0 on the Galaxy S5 smartphone, but not on this flagship tablet? What is good for the goose, should be good for the gander, I say.\n\nThe Tab S 10.5 uses a mixture of capacitive buttons and a hardware button on the long end of the rectangular bezel. Capacitive buttons are OK on a smartphone, but fail on a tablet. In other words, the hardware home button is fine -- the capacitive ones are the hindrance.\n\nWhen holding the Tab S vertically, my thumb is constantly hitting these touch-sensitive buttons. It ruins the experience when doing something like reading, as you want to be immersed in the story. Very often, when I relax and get comfortable, my thumb wanders to those buttons and ruins it all. Could this just be a learning curve? Sure, maybe I can train myself not to hit those buttons, but that should not be necessary. You can see what I am talking about in the above photo.\n\nFor internet activity, it is a Wi-Fi only affair. This is fine, as I mostly use tablets in my home. If it does leave the house, I simply tether using my phone. The wireless chip in the Tab S is top-notch though, offering 802.11AC. When connecting to my Apple Airport Extreme, the 5GHz band was visible, it connected quickly and was super-fast. Nice!\n\nThe iPad Air is a class-leader in battery life, but the Tab S is no slouch. While I did have to charge it more often than the iPad with equal usage, it still outperformed any other Android tablet I have used. On average, I would say it achieved about 10 hours of use between recharges, which for my usage, meant it would be charged about every three days. It would be in standby when not in use.\n\nMy favorite aspect of the Samsung Galaxy S5 is the fingerprint reader. I am happy to say that it is equally accurate on the Tab S. However, I find it a bit awkward to use on a 10 inch tablet, when located on the middle of the bottom-horizontal bezel. I would prefer it to be located on the top right of the face, so I can easily slide my finger. This means the fingerprint reader and the button should be separated on tablets. Do I appreciate having it? Yes. Do I use it often? Yes. Is it ideally located? No.\n\nAll in all, this tablet is incredible and should be bought although there are some things that holds it back from beating the iPad\n\nPlease rate if you found this helpful"}

The only thing I can possibly complain about are the speakers. They are very small and not very loud, but it has bluetooth so I am going to buy a wireless speaker. LOVE THIS TABLET. Get the \"book cover\" for it. It is a must have with this tablet. It protects it and lets you view it in three angles.\n\nUPDATE: This tablet just keeps getting better. The GPS chip in the Tab S is unbelievably accurate. When I pull up my location it shows a blue dot sitting not only on top of my house, but in the right room. I have now also (very happily) learned I can print from it to my wifi printer AND the newest version of Android (Kit Kat 4.4) is just simply incredible. I turned off the fingerprint scanner because I don't need it. I didn't even test it out. The camera was of little importance to me, but I do like how you can use your voice to capture an image. It takes surprisingly good pictures because of that feature since there isn't any camera shake from pressing a shutter button. You can also use the GPS to add location tags to your photos which I think is very cool.\n\nI bought the 32gb version in Titanium Bronze and put a 64gb, class 10 microSD card in it. It now has plenty of storage. LOVE THIS TABLET.\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S-10-5-Inch-Tablet-16-GB-Titanium-Bronze/dp/B00KHA5G6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5-Inch Tablet (16 GB, Titanium Bronze)</a>\n\nUPDATE: (now owned for a month). The bluetooth on this tablet is flawless. I am able to play music to my bluetooth stereo from rooms other than where my stereo is. Even from my patio! And as stated before, GET THE SNAP ON \"BOOK COVER\". It protects the tablet and makes using it very easy. It actually snaps onto the back of the tablet so there aren't any silly straps or anything holding it on. I don't plan on ever taking the book cover off. LOVE THIS TABLET."}

Spotify is still king of music applications.\n\nAll in all, a very easy buying recommendation for me. I feel like I still have a few months to grow into this tablet with so many cool features. Bloatware has been reduced, and there are a lot of perks that I haven't even touched yet. I'm hoping for some better cases and perhaps a better charger, but very happy with the purchase overall.\n\nNote: I bought the 32 GB tablet from Best Buy. Even with the SD card, with most applications requiring disk storage, I'd spend the extra $50 and get the 32GB version. You will be using this for the next 3-4 years easily and you don't want to run out of storage!"}

You are much more likely to get stranded on android updates than if you had any sort of nexus device.  GPU performance isn't as strong compared to other tablets, due to the Exynos processor.

While its body is plastic, it does not feel cheap or flimsy.  It is both thinner and lighter than my first Acer tablet, but that was a 7\" model.  Also like the S5, the Tab S has the dimpled back.  The controls are well laid out, and it feels familiar.  To me, it lives up to its paper and has the feel of a premium tablet.\n\nSetup:  Unlike other tablets, Samsung does not specify a specific amount of time for the first charge of the Tab S.  I simply put it on the charger and waited for the battery level to reach 100%.  It was at about 90% after a couple of hours when I went to bed - note it was at about 65% when I plugged it in.  I left it charging overnight, but Im not sure how much longer it took to get to 100%.  There is a firmware update to install after initial setup, but I had no issues with it.  The tablet boots fairly quickly - 20 to 30 seconds.\n\nDisplay:  You may be wondering, Does the 2560 x 1600 resolution make that much difference?  In a word - yes!  Other than size, this is the biggest difference between the Tab S and the S5.  For a phone, the Galaxy S5 is no slouch by any means, but the Galaxy Tab S has eye-popping wow-factor.  I switched to the wallpaper to the one with the Ferris wheel, and it looks amazing.  Text is sharp and crisp, and web pages, Flipboard, email, and almost everything look great.\n\nVideo:  So whats the best way to take advantage of that magnificent display?  Moving watching is a sport.  And when it comes to movies, this is the tablet.  Netflix, YouTube, or your favorite app for watching your Ultraviolet collection are *the* way to showcase that screen.  You just might need to call in sick so that you can binge watch your favorite movies and shows.\n\nMusic:  While the Galaxy Tab S is not a boom box or stereo, its speakers are more than serviceable for private listening.  Headphones improve sound if youve invested in a good set.  If you are looking at a premium tablet, you probably have premium headphones to go with it.  Amazons Prime Music is a great way to consume your music, but it is one of a multitude of options.  When you have the ability to add up to 128GB of storage through microSD cards, you can source your music just about any way that fits your budget.  The good news is that you are covered.\n\nGames:  The Galaxy Tab S also has great support for games.  It has plenty of processor and memory to handle intensive games like Riptide GP2, and once again, the display shows off - it really cant help itself.  Are Plants vs. Zombies or Angry Birds more your speed?  These are here too with one exception.  There is an issue with Angry Birds Epic that seems to be unique to the Galaxy Tab S (and this is the only reason I still use my ASUS MeMO Pad FHD).  Other than that, it is game on!\n\nUsability:  As I mentioned in design, the controls of the Galaxy Tab S are well laid out and intuitive to use.  The user interface is almost identical to that of the Galaxy S5, and I know get why iPhone/iPad people are so locked in.  This is the first time that Ive had a phone and tablet that were so harmonious.  TouchWiz is a fine skin over stock Android.  It doesnt make me do backflips, but I don't hate it either.  Navigation and customization are smooth and straightforward.  The Galaxy Tab S is highly customizable, and it will delight power users looking to tweak everything to the nth degree.  The only thing I would have liked to be easier was switching the app sorting to alphabetical.  This was hard to find, and the default sorting drove me crazy.  Thats as close to a complaint as I can get.\n\nAccessories:  Samsung has distanced itself from the pack in the Android world, and there are benefits to going with the front-runner.  The first among them is the variety of accessories.  I bought a Samsung Book Cover designed for the tablet, but you have other options already.  Belkin I know has a case, but others will follow soon.  Accessory makers love the front-runner.  If you want a keyboard, Samsung makes a keyboard cover specifically for the Galaxy Tab S.  However, once again, there are other choices.  My generic Logitech keyboard for Honeycomb tablets works just fine, but even Logitech already has a keyboard case available.  I would even go so far as to say that the Galaxy S5 could be thought of as an accessory with the SideSync app.  It is a snap to mirror your Galaxy S5 on your Galaxy Tab S and have control over it.  If you are looking for other accessories, you should expect to find them for Samsung Tablets.\n\nOverall:  The Samsung Galaxy Tab S is a premium priced tablet that delivers a premium experience.  The classic question will be, Is this an iPad killer?  The think that is the wrong question.  My wife is an iPhone/iPad user, and I played with both of these devices before upgrading my Android devices to the Samsung line.  While both the iPad and Galaxy Tab S are both premium tablets, they delight users in different ways.  The iPad is for people looking for an easy it just works experience who also don't worry about high levels of customization.  Android tablets are about freedom and customization.  Both tablets have very similar core capabilities.  It really comes down to preference.  If you are sold on Android, don't fear the investment in the Samsung Galaxy Tab S.  It is simply worth it."}

It's light - weight, which makes it great for traveling, also, it's really great for working on while traveling. For the most part any app you'd like to download on there you can. He did find it easy to sync his phone calendar to the tablet. Menu layouts are easy to use. Sound is great, a speaker on each side. A movie was watched on it and the picture was amazingly clear.  I'm really pleased with this tablet, he loves it, and I'm am considering purchasing one for myself later on.\n\nMy only hold off with actually purchasing one is that AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THIS TABLET!!!!!!! SAY WHAT???? THAT'S CORRECT IT'S NOT. For me this was a huge let down and I did purchase the Kindle Fire and love it. However, I need something that I can use for entertainment and work while traveling. If traveling I don't want to pack my Kindle Fire and a tablet, just to access Amazon Instant Video.\n\nQUESTION FOR AMAZON: Why are all the other Amazon applications compatible and Instant Video is not? Are there any plans to make Amazon Instant Video compatible with this tablet?"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "Have only had it two weeks, may adjust up or down based on a few months of use.\n\nI am primarily writing this in reference to some of the negative reviews I have seen.\n\nThough I am a huge fan of Amazon, I bought this on launch day at BB because a) They were the only that had the 32GB in stock (no other sites/stores were even listing it), b) I have zero patience and wanted my instant gratification fix :); and c: BB had a really great deal where you could trade in any working device and get $100 ($50 off the tablet + a $50 gift card on the spot).\n\nI traded in a first gen Nexus 7 that had both some battery and wifi issues. I had been reasonably happy with it, but knew that I wanted a larger Android tablet.\n\nMy experience so far:\n\n- Battery life has been excellent. I have yet to take it on a trip or subject it to hours of movie watching. I have spent a few hours during a day browsing the net, watching streaming content, and using the Kindle app. Through all of those activities, the battery performance has been great.\n\n- I have not had any issues with app slow downs or pauses. The tablet seems quite speedy to me.\n\n- The fingerprint scanner works reasonably well (I have never used one before, so I don't have anything to compare it to). You do have to slide your finger just right, but I suppose that that's kind of a given. One thing I find a bit odd is that when you go to the lock screen settings it lists all of the ways you can secure your tablet, from least secure to most secure. Swipe to unlock is least secure (duh!) and password is most secure. Interestingly, fingerprint is rated in the middle . . . that seems odd because one's fingerprint is unique.\n\n- As all of the reviews have stated, the screen is gorgeous. I have yet to test it with any truly spectacular content (maybe I deleted the Samsung video a little too fast! lol), I'm certainly happy with what I have seen so far.\n\n- I think the weight is fine.\n\n - I purchased the bronze unit and think that it's rather handsome. I know that some pro reviewers think that it's chintzy that it's plastic masquerading as plastic, but I'm not that bothered by it. That said, I own a Galaxy S4 (my work provided phone) and a HTC One (my personal phone). When voting with my wallet, I'd go with the higher quality build . . . but, since a metal (or something other than plastic) wasn't available for this device or any of the android options I considered, I'm fine with the Samsung plastic.\n\n- I also liked that you could use a SD card. That said, this is one area where I had a few issues. The device would recognize the card every few minutes. ANNOYING! I took it out, re-seated it firmly, and the issue went away. Too early to tell if this is a design or user issue."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "This tablet with the actual Samsung OEM cover is fantastic.  Whatever praise has been heaped on the screen isn't nearly enough.  Bright, sharp, contrast, blacks, and whatever else can be said to be good about it certainly is.\n\nI love it all around so far and agree with all the positive comments.\n\nThe very few niggles I have already have been expressed by others.  Namely, there can be an occasional lag.  I don't know why.  In addition, the screen can be a little overly distracting because of all the non-icon stuff on there.  I prefer a screen with icons.  That's it.  It's a personal thing, but it seems to me that a reduction in clutter would be a welcome thing by anyone."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "I question every review over 3 Stars on the Galaxy Tab S as either premature or paid reviews because my experience can no way be isolated. I had my Tab S for 9 days and in that time I experienced why this tablet was years away from even a slight comparison to the iPad. To be clear, I am NOT a fan of Apple products.\n\nFirst, the screen is beautiful. The colors on images and videos pop right out. It's an eye catching experience just looking at the technology of an Amoled screen. Size and weight are also perfect but that is where the positive attributes end.\n\nFirst, I travel quite a bit and this tablet was for movies on the plane, reading books and magazines and catching up on email. You cannot access or play your Amazon Prime library as Amazon only supports Amazon tablets for downloading and playing movies. At least on the iPad you can play your Prime movies. Not on the Tab S, you are just dead in the water. You can however access Flickster movies and save them to Dropbox, which works well.\n\nAfter viewing movies, I noticed images and videos were blurred from frame to frame and the darks were very distorted. I tried changing the display setting but nothing worked. When reading web pages or books and magazines on the first few pages would be in view and others were blurry. Nothing seemed to correct this either. I brought my Tab S into Best Buy they were aware of this issue and had seen it on a few returns. So in other words, nothing you can do to correct it.\n\nThe camera is great and pics are crisp and clear. For me, a camera on a tablet is a bit useless but I was impressed with the clarity of images.\n\nNow to the big issue which caused me to return my Galaxy Tab S. Latency and Lag. If you are clicking on an app, using the back button or just navigating from task to task, you will find yourself waiting for the tablet to catch up to you. For has powerful as this thing is in terms of Specs, it is slow and locks up quite a bit. It is frustrating because it happens all the time and is not isolated from one area to another. This was the back breaker for me. Not to mention no access to Outlook for email when the Samsung email client will not sync Outlook sub-folders and is outdated. People told me to download 3rd party apps to make email work. That makes no sense. It works on the iPad, Surface, Google and Asus tablets without a 3rd party app so why is Samsung so far behind in technology?\n\nI almost forgot, Battery life is 6 to 7 hours in real time use. Where they are coming up with 9 to 10 is amazing.\n\nAll and all, the Galaxy Tab S is a huge disappointment. Sure the screen is nice but over a short period of time you start to realize that everything else is below par. I would not recommend this tablet to anyone especially with the huge price point."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "This is the best Android tablet I've ever owned. Thanks to beautiful AMOLED display, there's no horrific light bleed that I had with the Note 2014. Color is over-saturated but this can be evaded by changing display mode. However, out of the box performance was horrible. It came with tons of preinstalled bloatware which caused a major lag and waste of storage. For example, I don't use Netflix but it won't allow me to uninstall it without root. Fortunately, there's an option that allows me to disable most of the preinstalled apps and got rid of the lag issue. Well, lag and stutterness aren't completely gone but they were sure reduced by 99%. Although this won't free up more space, but if you want smooth, stutter-less experience, be sure disable the preinstall apps."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "This is my fourth Samsung 10 inch tablet Ive tried in the last couple of years. Ive always wanted to replace my iPad with an android tablet especially one made by Samsung. Almost all my electronics that I own are made by Samsung, except for my iPad Air and Apple TV 2. This tablet is an improvement over the Tab pro which was released just 6 short months ago. I kind of wish Samsung had just waited longer and released this tablet instead of the tab pro.\n\nWhats new and improved:\n\nThe tab s feels much better built over previous Samsung tablets Ive tried. The previous tablets had a much more plastic feel to them and make clicky sounds when holding them. This one feels nice in the hand with the nice grippy material and also looks more higher end.\n\nTouch wiz is more simplified and faster.\n\nThis tablet has 3gb of ram, which is 1gb more than the tab pro.  Its much faster now and multitasking is smoother. More apps can run in the background and fewer refreshes in apps and on webpages.\n\nImproved screen quality since the screen is now an AMOLED, its brighter and has better battery life. The screen is also larger now at 10.5\" when compared to the tab pro which was 10.1\".\n\nThis tablet has a built in finger print scanner. This is a very handy feature to have for added security without having to type in a PIN, password or pattern. Too bad this feature hardly works. I had to slide my finger a good two to three times for it to register and unlock the screen for me. No other tablet on the market has this feature currently including the iPad Air. I am glad samsung added this feature but it needs work.\n\nUltra power saving mode can greatly increase battery life especially when it's very low. Although it turns the screen into black and white and only allows you to use a few selected apps. I really don't see how this is that handy on a tablet, but, is super handy to have on your smartphone like it is on the s5. Still nice for samsung to include this.\n\nSide Sync is an built app that allows you to access your Samung Galaxy Smartphone remotely while on the same wifi network. You can take calls, read/reply to texts and transfer files from you tablet. This is very handy feature. I thought initially it only worked on the newer S5 but I was able to download the app on my S4. Sadly I couldn't get the feature to work with my s4.\n\nThe tab s also has a new private mode which allows you to hide files, pictures and videos. The private mode is also incorporated with finger print scanner so that the hidden files only show when using your finger to unlock the screen.\n\nWhat still needs improvement:\n\nThe placement of the menu and back capacitive buttons still comes in the way and gets accidentally pressed when using the tablet in portrait mode. I guess you could just use the tablet in landscape mode all the time.\n\nThe tablet ecosystem in the google play for 10\" tablets is very limited. There are still many apps that just don't take advantage of this tablets larger, higher resolution screen or aspect ratio. This is not the case with iPads and one of the main reasons why I still prefer my iPad Air. Some of the apps cant even run in landscape mode which is what this tablet is meant to be used in. Here is just a small list of the tablet apps that are not optimized yet: Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Yelp, Dropbox, Dictionary, Instagram, Epocrates, Medscape, WebMD, Zedge, Tapatalk.\n\nI still found there to be some lag from time to time. At times the tablet was just really fast and other times it was lagging for no apparent reason. I installed nova launcher and disabled many samsung and google unneeded apps to make it slightly better.\n\nI also found there to be issues with the network connection. The tablet always seemed to be connected to my router but from time to time I experienced issues with it loading pages or refreshing apps. I had no issues like this on any other device on my network. So I suspect it was the tablet only that this issue.\n\nThe screens responsiveness was not up to par with other touch screen devices I own and tried. At times I would have to press the screen muilitiple times before it would respond.\n\nThe watch on tv remote seemed to give me very odd and weird information. It would show me content that had nothing to do with my cable provider or the channels I selected. I took a look at the same app on my Samsung S4 and the information was totally different. The information on th s4 app was correct. Maybe a future update to the wach on app on the tab s will improve the results for me.\n\nAlthough battery life is much improved in this tablet. Its still not as good as what Im getting with my iPad Air. With the tab s I was getting about 8-10 hours of screen time mostly from surfing web pages and a little youtube streaming. With the brightness at about 30% and some notifications enabled. With my iPad Air I can easily get 15 hours with the same type of usage and settings. If I really push its limits I can get about 18 hours of screen time on my iPad Air.\n\nSamsung Tab S vs iPad Air\n\nThe tab s clearly has better hardware and specs. The screen is so much better than the iPad Air. The tab s has higher resolution screen and more pixels per inch than the iPad Air.  The iPad Air's 9.7\" screen is smaller than the tab s which is 10.5\". The screen also get much brighter is great for outdoor use. The screen also gets much dimmer which is better for night reading.\n\nThe placement of the speakers on the tab s is much better. When watching a video you get the nice stereo effect in landscape mode. With the iPad Air the speaker are not placed on either side of the screen, so you only get the stereo effect when using the tablet in portrait mode. I did find the speakers on the iPad Air to have more bass in them. Both tablets had just as loud speakers in my opinion.\n\nThe Tab s had micro sd slot so expanding storage is cheap and easy. It accepts cards up to 128gb. But the use of card is limited quite a bit now since the kitkat update. Not at appps can run and be stored on the sd card. Also apps iSyncr for example which is an app that allows you to transfer your music wirelessly from your PC to your tablet/phone, only works when connecting your devcie via usb to your pc. Or you have to root your device to gain full rights over your own sd card.\n\nThe tab s has only about 10gb of available storage out of the box. There is no 32b version available right now and also no choice of getting more storage. With an iPad you can get up to 128gb storage, but storage is expensive at $100 each step up.\n\nThe tab s has included gps. In order to get gps with an Ipad you have buy an LTE enabled model which is another $120.\n\nThe tab s can run two apps side by side at the same time. Not all apps are support with this feature, but its very handy when multitasking. The IPad Air cant do this.\n\nThe tab s has the watch on tv app and a built in IR blaster. Makes it easy to control your home entertainment system from your tablet. The iPAd AIr doesnt have this feature.\n\nOverall the tab s is nice improvement over the last version. My main reason in sticking with my Ipad Air is the app support. I also prefer the 4:3 ratio that the Ipad AIr has. It looks great in portrait mode for reading and browsing web pages. I don't like the tab s in portrait mode it just isn't functional that way. If you use your tablet mostly for watching videos and playing games, I would say the tab s is the better choice. Also if you use your tablet alot outdoors than the tab s is better since it gets brighter. But the Ipad does have better battery life, better support,higher resale value, Airplay, Multitasking Gestures and more accessories. Also the Ipad Air will updates much quicker. I have no idea how long the Tab s will take to get android L. Probably atleast a good 3-6 months once its publicly released. Where as the Ipad AIr will get iOS 8 the day it comes out. My only main gripe about my Ipad Air right now is the lack of ram, at 1gb it has to refresh apps and website frequently. The tab s is better for multitasking. You cant go wrong either way. They both are great tablets. But the tab s is more versatile and has better value.\n\nUpdate: Just wanted to add a few things I missed in my initial review. The tab s has the faster wireless which is ac when compared to the iPad Air which does not have ac wireless. This will only be an advantage if you have an ac wireless compatible router.\n\nThe tab s takes a little bit less than 7 hours to fully charge. Versus the iPad Air which takes a little bit over 4 hours to charge.\n\nAlso the tab s does not have NFC capability."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "After using a Galaxy S5 and experiencing the AMOLED screen, I couldn't wait to finally get it on a larger form factor Galaxy Tab S 10.5.  The screen is the main selling point for me more than any other feature and having microSD for extra storage just makes it even better to hold higher resolution pictures and video to utilize the display.\n\nThe screen quality just makes me wish more than Sony didn't switch to IPS on the latest PS Vita, and hopefully the Galaxy Tab S will encourage the other players especially Apple and Microsoft to offer the AMOLED option in future products.\n\nThere are some areas that could be improved, I had hoped it supported USB3.0 and high speed data transfer to the microSD, the built-in speakers could be better, better add-on software but overall it is still at par or slightly better than what is on the market today on the support features."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "i'm an artist painter and photographer, and i write poetry and stuff... so, here goes:\n\nso far, so good -- the screen image is very tight, very nice and the size makes webpage reading easy. the camera is only so-so on low light, but i have cameras for low light and i'm not selfies-izing my life anyway. very quick, noticeably from my galaxy 4 7.\n\nonly negative is that it's so large and i don't have a pocket for it and will have to carry a bag, i think. i'm looking today at the timbuk2 small classic messenger.\n\nI got this for an upcoming europe trip -- i should say that i don't and won't have a cell phone, so i'm strictly dependent on hot spots for connections when i'm not home. and, using this for reading a QR code at a bus stop in some town i might visit seems to me might be a little awkward; i guess i'm wondering how practical this really is. it's lighter and cheaper than a laptop, can do handwriting to font conversion in most text-input apps -- gmail for instance, and is big enough to watch movies on -- the resolution actually makes small-screen viewing sort of viable as movie --\n\nand, i suppose i'll get a bluetooth keyboard of some kind for writing essays and the stuff i do, when i'm travelling -- or, maybe even at home in bed... my expensive powerbook G4 mac broke at the electrical input so all i have is desktop pc these days... and, that would be a life-style changer: casual writing modes and how that would effect writing style. still, it's not like i'm going to be ( i hope ) burying my face in this machine every other moment, the way you see people doing now -- watching a screen while there's the most beautiful light out and the bus is driving past forests which look like they're out of disney.\n\nit's just the second day i've had this, though, and what do i know...? But, anyway, Amazon was great! I pre-ordered, and they said they'd send me an email when they could ship, and the next thing i know it's in my mailbox on the 27th -- just as i was wondering how long before they had it in stock.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KHA5G6G", "review": "Everyone knows all the pro's, so let's look at what they messed up:\n\nNot much.  Just the same pesky stuff they've been messing up for years (read engineers isolated in a vacuum lol).\n\nAn inherent design issue with these slab-tabs is grip.  Samsung chose to ship this without a cover, and they make it extremely hard to get one in the first 30 days.  They also did this on all of their high end phones such as the Note series.  Without a cover, it's a slip/drop accident in the making.  Yes, you'll drop it, and yes you'll have finger prints all over the screen trying to hold on.\n\nIMHO the 3rd party warranties that are being pushed are another accident in the making.  Never hear too many good outcomes about these guys, and plan to be without your Tab for a while.  I noticed in the reviews that most owners just get their old one back in the same condition, but now officially certified broken.\n\nRemember this thing has no cellular radios.  Not that I really want one.  If I need wifi while on the road etc, I just mobile hotspot my cell (free with ATT nowadays @ 20GB it's about time).  They also ignored texting with this device, but there's a few downloads I'm going to try.\n\nA lot of apps are not ready for this amount of hi-res screen real estate.  But they're getting there.  Some just look sloppy, and a few will core/quit.\n\nThe multi-window thing is not much more than work in progress.  It only works with a few apps, and then it seems silly.  I'd rather the tab itself speed up foreground application switching, through cache etc. than a failed attempt at true windowing.\n\nButtons.  Menu isn't menu.  The home is now on the side when you use it up/down.  And without a case or a grip, you'll always be hitting some button that will take you into some other part of the world.  Get used to using your left hand for back, home, and get used to using your fingernails to hang on.\n\nThe fingerprint reader is not all that hot.  It doesn't work half the time, and will time you out for a full 30 secs after 3-4 failed tries.  I just turned it off.  That was one feature I really thought I'd like and could use, but in practice it's just not that useful.  A old-timey screen swipe is still king of the unlocks.\n\nPerformance is ok, but it won't knock you off your chair.  But ok is good enough in this case.  Not sure if the 8 core processors that are being used for the non-US units perform any better, but I would imagine they would.  Main issue you'll experience is a small lag from one screen or app to another.  Sometimes it can be a second or so.  Not much really, but do it 30x and you'll find yourself waiting a surprising amount of time overall.\n\nSamsung/Google STILL does not have resizable icons - even on Android 4.x.  The icons are circa-2008 and are huge.  The screen is so hi-res, you could shrink your icons down to 25% of their concreted-size and still be very visible and useful.  So if you want to really customize your UI, you'll have to go with another launcher.  I use Go-Launcher (have for years).  Now I've got 10 icons across, and about 15 rows down.  With text.  And the hot-icons at the bottom are also customizable.\n\nIn fact while I'm at it, this whole stupid touchwiz thing has just got to go.  It's a static, pre-configured UI and not even worthy of a tab of this caliber.  Look guys, put your development efforts into making Android a full blown OS rather than re-arranging the icons every release for each device then calling it \"the new TouchWiz\".  Team up with one of the launcher guys and make it useful.  Windows and IOS are kicking your butt here.\n\nSome of the *free* software like Dropbox is surprisingly useful.  But to get dropbox to work, you'll have to refer 5 friends, install it on 2 other computers and the like.  More fine print.  And read it carefully if you're making your purchasing decision based on free s/w as they all have some little kink like that.\n\nNow charging and batteries.  First you MUST use the included charger and cable.  It will not charge with a 3rd party micro USB cable, or a longer one.  It will not charge with another USB port.  It will charge while connected to my iMac, but not a Thinkpad.  And it still takes forever to charge - like 4-5 hours at the shortest.  Now in all fairness since it's new I'm banging it pretty hard, and killing the battery in about 5-6 hours of use time.  The sleep mode keeps all the wifi/BT stuff alive, not sure how to put them to sleep also but maybe you can.  Not sure it matters as that huge screen is the highest power drainer.\n\nAnd no, you can't swap out the batteries like you can on the Notes or S3-4-5.  And you've never been able to swap batteries on any Apple IOS product.  Heck, iPad/iPhone still don't have a memory card slot after 10 years of incessant screaming from their customers.  Actually since Steve died they haven't had much of anything new have they - but that's another story.\n\nOk, if you've read this far you know all the annoying stuff that's still not fixed or well conceived.  Believe me - none of this annoying stuff is a show stopper for this unit.\n\nWhy?  Because the ONE thing that we use the most, and the one thing we've tossed the most rocks at Samsung about - the screen - is by far the best display of about any device out there.  And it's better than almost all computers sans the new 4k displays.  From our incessant screaming for years for 1) replaceable battery 2) stereo speakers 3) memory card slot 4) a super-hi res screen 5) fingerprint login and 6) a thin bezel, out of the 6 they fixed 3 or 4 pretty well.  Not bad.  LG, Sony and Apple take note and turn up your hearing aid.  (Oh - yes there are two speakers on this thing left and right that somehow did not make the specs list).\n\nSamsung always waits to see sales figures before they make cases and keyboards.  So you'll wait as nobody else has them either.\n\nSo for the $$, I felt I really got what I paid for.  I reassure myself every time I turn it on and it jumps out at me.  And everyone around me hangs over my shoulders to see.  Yea, it's that good"}

With the original Android OS, it was OK, but once you update the OS all of a sudden the battery won't hold a charge no matter what your power saver settings are.  This tablet is too expensive to deal with charging it three times a day."}

I ordered a samsung Tab s 10.5 tablet before turning on tablet, the tablet had a big dent on the speaker side and when i tried turning it on the whole screen was green and what do you know the dent on the side cracked the screen as well. When I purchased the item it stated used 7.5-8 out of 10. I have never had any issues before but this is really bad business sending a broken item wasting time, now I have to go out of my way to resend an item that is damaged."}
