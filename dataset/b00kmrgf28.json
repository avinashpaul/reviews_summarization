{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "As of this writing, the price direct from Dell is much lower than at Amazon, especially if you opt for Dell's financing. A fully functional windows 8.1 15.6\" laptop costing in the low $200s is mind blowing. Part of the $ savings derives from the lack of an optical drive or touch screen.\n\nThere isn't much to say. I've had it for about 2 weeks, so I can't judge durability. The laptop is made from cheap plastic, but the screen is nice, the keyboard feels sturdy and comfortable, you have a full numeric keypad. The only negative is the trackpad, which is usable but not good. We prefer to use a mouse instead.\n\nWe only use it for basics, like web browsing, Office, printing, sending email. It's certainly fast enough for all that. It connects to the wifi network quickly, and web browsing is fine.\n\nI bought it from Dell and it came with a 1year home repair warranty. Really this is an outstanding value, if your computing needs are light.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI've had it 4 months. It runs the same as the day we got it.\n\nFYI, it doesn't come with recovery disks, but there is a built-in utility to burn your own disks. Since the pc doesn't have an optical drive, you'll need an external drive to burn them."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "This is no I7 laptop, let's just get that straight.  But, it makes a good second back up laptop for me.  I'm using it to write this review right now.  I ordered mine from dell, at the time it was cheaper than amazon, and dell had them in stock.  I did remove the hard drive and replaced it with an SSD I had laying around which helped speed it up considerably.  It is a bit laggy at times, but overall it is usable and better than I would have expected for this price range.\n\nHere are the pros as I see them:\n-The price, the price, the price\n-The weight is much lighter than my I7 high end laptop\n-Battery lasts 5-7.5 hours depending on use, many Windows laptops in this price range only last 3 hours so this is a huge advantage.\n-The battery is user replaceable, which you can't take for granted anymore in a laptop.  Press two buttons and it pops right out!\n-Many laptops recently make it very hard to get access to the RAM and Harddrive for upgrades.  Several dells require you to completely disassemble the entire laptop to get to the hard drive including removing the screen, motherboard, track pad etc.  Which is a huge pet peave of mine.  This laptop has an access panel on the bottom to access the RAM and HD which is great!\n-A large 15.6 inch screen for a great price\n-This CPU doesn't run hot at all and has decent performance for the price.\n-It runs so cool it doesn't even have a fan at all!\n-Keyboard has a number pad, many don't in this price range.\n-Keyboard feels nice and doesn't feel too cheap, we will see with time though how it holds up.\n-Trackpad works good, buttons are loud when clicked though.\n-Nice to have a Windows laptop for this price, I like chromebooks but I can't connect to my at home Samba server from a chromebook so I gravitate to Windows.\n\nCons:\n-There are the obvious ones like no USB 3, no Bluetooth, no wired ethernet, no CD/DVD Drive.  But in this price range I'm ok with that.  I have an external USB CD/DVD that I used to install Office on it so that wasn't an issue for me.\n-Windows 8.1, is better than 8.0 but if you have never used it before there is a learning curve for sure compared to Windows 7/Vista\n-Not blazing fast but you can't expect that from any pc in this price range.\n-Case feels cheap, it creaks and groans when I pick it up by a corner.\n-The quality of the video is pretty low, but once again it is usable for watching youtube, netflix videos, etc.  Just is less sharp than my high end laptop and can be a tad laggy occasionally.\n\nWould I recommend this???  Depends on your needs.  If you are on a tight budget and are a light PC user who wants to use it just for basic web surfing, Word Processing, and light youtube/netflix watching this will work fine for most people\n\nIf you are a high end, heavy user, I'd only use this as a backup laptop.  I would not be happy with this as my primary laptop personally since I'm a very heavy user.\n\nIf you are a gamer, you of course know enough to not even look at this laptop as an option.\n\nUpgrade possibilities:  If you know what you are doing upgrading the hard drive to an SSD will help it feel more useable.  Also, I have not done so yet, but my understanding is that you can upgrade this to 8GB of ram which could help too.  It only has one slot for ram so you will have to remove the stock 4gb and replace it with an 8GB.  Make sure to get the DDR3L (The L stands for low voltage).  You want the 1.35 volt not 1.5 it may work with the 1.5 but will run hotter and use more battery.  The laptop comes with 1333mhz ram, but I think 1600mhz will work and run faster.  Take this with a grain of salt as have not tried it yet, but I believe the following RAM will work, and this is the type I plan to try upgrading to someday.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Technology-1600MHz-PC3-12800-KVR16LS11/dp/B00CQ35HBQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1402328644&sr=8-2&keywords=8GB+DDR3+1600MHz+sodimm+DDR3L\n\nUpdate 6/23/14: I did buy and install the 8gb of Ram above.  It works great, but it does down clock the ram to 1333mhz as the CPU won't handle 1600mhz speeds.  But, the 1600mhz 1.35v ram does work great in here.  It feels even snappier now.  Between the SSD I installed and the 8gb of ram this computer is very usable and fairly snappy for most tasks.  The only time I see the video and cpu lagging a bit is if I am on a webpage with heavy adobe flash usage on it.  But, right now I have two browsers open and about 30 browser tabs open with now slowdown.  I'm still quite happy with this laptop for the money.  It is just important to throttle your expectations, this can't be compared to an Intel I7 CPU $1000 laptop, but it is good for basic web browsing!\n\nUpdate 8/22/14 I noticed several people that complained about the performance realized if they removed the demo anti virus and crapware that it runs better.  I reinstalled windows from scratch from my USB DVD when I put in the SSD so I effectively removed all of the crapware by reinstalling and only putting the essential drivers back on.  That is probably why mine runs much faster and better than some of the reviewers.  I would remove the anti virus and just use the built in windows 8.1 antivirus as that is less cpu and memory intensive.  Then uninstall of the other factory junk, like wild tangent games, toolbars etc.  If you don't want to do that manually in the past I used a free utility called PC Decrapifier that automated the cleanup and worked pretty good.  Also, you might need to change your power saving settings to be less restrictive so it is optimized more for speed.  Hope that helps..."}

Over time, I've become more sensitive to PC fan noise.  Since this laptop runs such a low power chipset, it is fanless and that's great.  I've upgraded to 8GB of RAM and to a 250GB SSD, which makes this laptop run much better than the stock setup.  The upgrade process for both was easy.  If you're looking for a low cost fanless laptop that is easy to upgrade (not a chromebook), this is a good choice.  By the way I run Ubuntu on this laptop with no issues."}

It has not had even one crash, bug, or glitch with it. Nothing in this laptop has been replaced or needs to be replaced yet. The fan runs very cool which prevents it from over heating. The hardware in this laptop is adequate for the price. It is used all day for gaming (bought it for a sister) and it runs smooth and fast without any noticeable decreases during the day. It has a very strong connection strength and can connect to the router - even from outside. This is an ideal laptop for children or for family."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "I bought this Dell back when it was on sale. It was a smart purchase!\n\nThere are many positives with this machine:\n\n1. It's not heavy like other laptops with this screen size.\n\n2. The processor coupled with the four gigs of ram makes the overall speed of the machine pretty decent for everyday tasks.\n\n3. The battery life is decent.\n\n4. Dell technical support did stand by their product after an issue developed with the stock internal hard drive. after contacting them, they immediately sent me a new hard drive under warranty. Installation was quite straight forward and although I've done this to many laptops over the years, it would be quite easy for a novice to do!\n\n5. The internal speakers are not bad! They have a bit more bass and volume than speakers on many smaller laptops.\n\n6. The keyboard is really comfortable to type on and it has the number pad! My biggest gripe with many laptops is that the keyboard is cramped but not so with this machine!\n\nAnd yes, there are some negatives:\n\n1. I would highly suggest swapping the stock hard drive for an ssd. The machine will be a lot more reliable as you won't need to worry about a rotating mechanical hd and the various issues that can come with one of those in a laptop computer.\n\n2. Windows 8/8.1 was and is a total dud. That being said, you can upgrade to Win 10 so that's not a big deal at this point.\n\n3. The case of the machine can dent and scratch easily. That being said, the machine does not feel flimsy and we've had no issues due to the design of this case.\n\n All in all, yes, I'd recommend this machine for general computing and lite entertainment."}

And granted, this is a low-end laptop/notebook, so I wasn't expecting much. I knew it was a stripped-down, bare bones good for email and web surfing sort of setup. However, I wasn't thrilled with it when I got it, largely because Windows 8.1 is a horrible beast of an OS, and the computer lagged more than I was used to when doing even the simplest things. It also seemed cheaply constructed - moreso than any other Dell laptop I've ever purchased. The screen quality was meh, there's no bluetooth or DVD drive - granted, I knew about the DVD drive when I purchased it, but I really wasn't expecting it not to have bluetooth.\n\nThe real killer for me was that the hard drive and motherboard completely crashed one month after the warranty expired, and the cost quoted to repair it was actually close to the price I paid for the computer. To get back the data I lost? Almost a grand. I did back up most everything critical, but frankly I lost a lot.\n\nSo a year later, I have found myself in the position of having to buy an all new PC.

What a bunch of crap.\n The way I found out was to go back to Amazon and check my old sells receipt and I saw where it says  under optical something is a No .Now who would know that the CD Rom player is called an optical/something . I will also complain to Amazon."}

A computer is not something you can try to get on the cheap or you just end up with a frustrating piece of garbage.  This machine constantly forces updates that take no less than an hour to complete.  The next obstacle is the infinite login.  It takes far too long to boot up.  Once it appears the login is complete and you are finally ready to roll, you're not.  It takes a solid ten minutes to get onto the internet, then the long delay between pages on websites.

This computer suits the bill, and for the price, can't beat it! The only problems I have had with it in two years are once every 2 months the mouse pad will freeze for couple minutes but has always come back, and one of my keys sticks a little bit.

There are no usb ports on the right side so if you like to have a wired mouse i hope your left handed or your cord is long. There is no ethernet input so if you don't have access to a good internet router the internet will be clunky.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "its not good but its also not considerably bad. I got this last Christmas and less than a year later it started to fall apart. I used for all purposes. Gaming, work, videos, streaming and if you go to the Dell website it even says that Inspirons could be used for all purposes, and it was working fine... for the first few months. After about 3 months of using it it started going considerably slow both in internet and other performance speed. there was also a panel on the bottom of the laptop that kept snapping out and i'm not kidding when I say I literally had to snap the panel back in. If that wasn't bad enough it would start to just turn off by itself both if left idle or I was actually doing something. I just shrugged this off as the computer just going slow because it was aging (even though it had only been a few months) I kept using it the way I was. About 7 months of having owned the computer the audio would just randomly cut off and no matter what I did i couldn't get it to come back on unless I completely shut down the computer, not even a restart would work. Now lets get onto the hardware of the laptop. Its very low on features all you get is a charging port, an HDMI port and two USB ports (which i also had problems with but I will get to later in this review). There is NO Ethernet port whatsoever and no microphone port either. Though these two components aren't required they're VERY useful to have and it's not as if without them the laptop will run faster it IS thick enough to put one on. Also there are only two USB ports? Most laptops have around three. Speaking of the USB ports THEY ENDING BREAKING OFF THE LAPTOP THEMSELVES. I was just using mouse one day and I take the mouse out and I pick up the laptop to take it to another room and and I hear  a faint little noise as if something fell onto the floor and i look around an find this little plastic USB part that is supposed to read what is inside the port just fell out the laptop. I tried to call Dell and see if there was anything I could do to fix it but the representative said that it was a \"wear and tear problem\" even though there is a one year warranty if bought new (which is how i bought it) and half the time of the call i'm pretty sure he didn't even know what he was talking about. He also said that to fix it, it was going to cost around $295 which at the time I bought it was more than what I paid for it, so I may as well have just bought a new one (as if i'm ever buying from Dell again). Now I know what you all are thinking \"well why don't you just use the mouspad\" well I am, it's very unresponsive and when it does work it just sorta does what it wants and when you try to click something with the mouspads buttons it takes a few times until the laptop actually processes what you want it to do and besides using a mouse is far easier than using any mouspad. Save your money with this hunk of junk and get an HP (or anything else really, a potato may serve you better) instead maybe THEY won't sell you a laptop that breaks down in less than a year."}

Explain to me other than fire or explosion how a battery is going to toast a motherboard, plus if so why didn't Dell replace it under warranty? Dell did not want to warrant their original repair, had to deal with them for 59 minutes and 34 seconds (actual phone time) to get them to do so. Asked them point-blank \"do you or don't you warrant your repair work?\" Was told \"no\" they do not.

I highly recommend you double check the power settings - disabling these helped this little machine a lot, a long with making sure Window's transparent and other settings were disabled.\n\nPersonally I wanted a nifty little machine that I could use to type on, maybe play some music or a video when I'm out of the house so that I wouldn't have to use and abuse my cell. It does the job very well for what I paid for it. The processor in mine is definitely on the \"very weak\" and can \"sort of\" stream a 1080 youtube video, though it does mostly okay with 720.\n\nAll in all for the price? Not bad.\n\nEdit: So even with Linux the machine still has problems running more than one webpage at a time.\nIf this had a slightly better processor I think this would be a very worthy 4/5 for the price. As is I feel that it's a 3/5 since it does about 3/5ths of my main machine's web browsing."}

I revise my previous opinion of this machine. All it needs is a RAM upgrade and it's just fine for the price. I suspect that an additional processor upgrade would make it great for the price.\n\nHands down this is the worst computer I've ever owned. It's barely fast enough to run Netflix videos, and if I don't restart it every couple hours, it will be too slow to use. On top of this, the Windows 8 operating system is extremely poorly designed. I recommend taking your $269 and going to a pawn shop. I can't imagine you'd do much worse than this machine."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "Like it a lot--best of all it has Windows 7--can't stand Window 8 and thereafter.  It's a big computer; it stays home.  For the price it is top-notch.  Please bear this review in mind with the price.  The screen-cover is thin and I'm always conscientious of this, so no heavy things on top; and because it's thin, it wobbles when you adjust the angle and when you move the laptop.  The sound is not back and loud enough for my purposes.  The DVD player is a bit flimsy but it has not failed and does the job.  After MS Vista you cannot buy to own MS Office apps: you RENT or buy the annual license to used MS Word/Office.  You'll be paying every year.  This is crap--one reason I am keeping my older laptops just so I don't have to keep buying the right to use Office Word or Excell or Access!!!  Anyone who uses the Cloud storage for important document is crazy--it's not your document if it's in some one else's home, is it!  Keep you own external storage drivers.  I would only keep downloaded music in any 'floating' storage facility--I wouldn't even keep pictures in any fluff storage.  The picture is sharp, color is true, but the screen is much wider than I'm used to: because of the thinner bezel you have more viewing screen--nothing is wrong with this; I just have to get used to it.  Not that crazy about the clear glossy screen; it does reflects too much back image but it does give the picture clear and truer color display; really great watching movies in the dark.  I'll be using this for the Internet and saving my older laptop for work.  For a couple of hundred bucks, this laptop is a great value.  Would have given it 5 stars if it the keyboard was backlit."}

Not too big a deal because installing the latest graphics driver off of Dell's website fixed the problem. At about the same time I discovered that the wireless card in this laptop (Dell Wireless 1506) is a piece of garbage. If you look at the top review for that wireless card here on Amazon, it talks about how with 802.11n you have to be sitting next to the router to get a good signal, which precisely describes my experience. Right now, I'm dealing with the fact that the display hurts my eyes.\n\nThe one bright side is that this computer isn't as slow as people make it out to be. I'm guessing the slowness that most people are experiencing is from the effects of the crappy wireless card.\n\nSo, yeah, this is the last time I buy a cheap laptop. Even if I overcome my current issue with this computer, it's been a hassle just to get this computer to run like it should out of the box.\n\nEdit: Bumping to from 2 to 3 stars. Turns out the screen is easier on the eyes after being in use for a while. I had a eye strain issue with a desktop I bought later on. I still think the wifi card is garb."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "I expect an inexpensive laptop to be slow, which this one certainly is, but I did not expect it to fall apart with normal use. One of my shift keys stopped functioning after I had owned the laptop for a couple months. Then the plastic casing that covers the hinge that opens the screen broke, then my comma key broke. Dell used to be a respected name in home computers, but I will never buy another Dell product. After the shift key broke, I requested a repair. Dell sent me a box in which to return the laptop to them for repair. A week or so later they sent me an email stating they had not received my laptop and were closing my case. When I contacted them, I was told I could send in the laptop anytime. Then I received another email that my case was closed. I'm concerned that if I send in the laptop, it will not be repaired and returned to me because they already notified me twice that I had taken too long to return the laptop and that my case was closed. October 2015 Update: I finally had to send the laptop in for repairs when it failed to power on. Dell has had my laptop for over a month now. After trying to check the status of the repair, I now get an email every few days that the repair status is still being sought. They cannot even tell me if the laptop is being repaired. They only know that they received it over a month ago."}

When we sent the computer back to them as Dell requested to be repaired or replaced per the warranty.  We were then told that it would cost $269.00 to repair because they believe the computer was dropped. The computer was taken care of very carefully and never dropped on our end. This is the first time I have ever seen a company not stand by their product warranty. The computer again was never dropped! Frustrated and will never buy a Dell product again. Buyer beware there is no warranty that they will stand by. The computer was sent to Texas but the only people you can talk to are in New Deli India (Prashant) the manager claims he is the top supervisor and the final word. We will not give up yet but are offended that Dell wants to blame this on us. Just another cost saving measure in my opinion. Offer a warranty that you never intend to honor."}

I strongly suggest if you're looking at this laptop, that you set aside some extra money for the Upgrades I mention.\n\nI first installed an SSD and a memory upgrade before I powered it on. I didn't even boot into Windows before installing Arch Linux, so I have only seen this laptop as a fast, lightweight, capable, everyday machine.\n\nThe memory upgrade I bought:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008LTBLLY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nThe SSD I bought:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OAJ5N6I/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nNow for the review. I really love this machine. My old laptop was a 6 and 1/2 year old gaming laptop that was finally on it's last legs. I needed something lighter and a bit simpler since I have another PC for gaming. After some research, this PC fit the bill. It's absolutely silent and is fairly cool for having no fans. While many reviews have said that this PC is dirt slow, I have to disagree. However, I installed Arch Linux on this PC right away, and it's made this Laptop the fastest PC in my house. To compare, my desktop has an i7, Xubuntu and 32GB of RAM. While I don't suggest newbies install Arch, I think that this PC should have shipped with Linux or should be installed to really appreciate how fast it is.\n\nI also wanted to answer a few questions I had about this machine.\n\nFirst, and most asked. No DVD/BD Drive. It has a Drive slot that I was planning on installing a caddy and second hard drive to, but the slot does not have a SATA connector. So, that means this PC will only ever have one Hard Drive and you cannot install a DVD/BD Drive inside.\n\nIt also has no Ethernet Port, not a dealbreaker, but sysadmins looking at this, may want a laptop with one.\nOnly 2 USB Ports, which is really only one if you need either a Ethernet connector or Optical drive."}

The machine is loaded with Windows 8.1 which acts as a funnel for adware regardless of the settings I use for popup blocking. The connection to the Internet uses a proxy server to connect. After diligent research I have tried every available method to remove the automatic proxy connection including changing the Registry, IE tools and settings in Chrome. The machine is slow, slow, slow and is basically useless. Shame on Dell. I know this is a cheap machine, but for one who only wanted to surf the Internet and check mail, it should suffice, but as I led in regrettably it is sadly lacking.

Kudos.\n\nthe limited number of USB ports,  is easy to overcome with a multiport USB adapter that works just fine.\n\nBasically the computer is a great value for the price.  Reviews about the computer were not bad. and the reviews suggested that it is fine for my needs. The processor is a Dual Core processor with 2ghz +/- speed! More than adequate for my needs\n\nIts an upgrade from my 8 year old Dell.

The first issue that we had was that although it was used-like new...it arrived with a substance on the back. I submitted a picture to Amazon Warehouse (AW) to see how it could be fixed and that issue was quickly resolved. THEN we noticed that there was an issue with the Intel SD Host Controller (code 10). Very lovely rep for Amazon offered 2 options and one was for a refund. I informed her that after chatting with the manufacturer...we would go from there. We were hoping it was an easy fix!!!\n\nI chatted with the manufacturer and was informed that they could not help me, because the computer was registered to someone else. The tech stated that he would see if there was any other way, but told me that he could not do anything for security reasons, which I completely understood. He then suggested that we contact Amazon to see who was the registered owner, but the only option according to Amazon is to just return it. Though, we could purchase another one...not at the same price...since it came from AW. My wife really likes the laptop, but the only option is to return it to Amazon, because it can't be registered to us at all. I wish that there was a way that AW could fix this, but I guess they can't."}

The laptop worked for a few months, and then the hard drive crashed.  Since it was still under warranty I contacted Dell and had to ship it off to be repaired. When it was returned I started it up and almost immediately the display failed. Once again I contacted Dell and shipped it back for repair.\n\nThis time Dell reused to repair it under warranty, claiming that I had damaged it in some way. This in spite of the fact that my sole interaction with it after it had been returned was taking out of the box and placing it on the desk.  They refused to even consider that it might have been damaged by one of their repair technicians or in shipping.\n\nThe customer service representatives were some of the most incompetent clueless individuals I have ever dealt with. For those of you familiar with Monty Pythons Dead Parrot sketch, I experienced this first hand in talking to one of these people.\nThis was my first Dell product I ever purchased and needless to say it will be my last. If you do decide to purchase this item and the display fails you are best sending it to a recycling center and putting the repair money towards another laptop.  It is apparently Dells policy that they do not replace laptop displays under warranty under any circumstances what so ever."}

On top of that it ran a total of about 20-30 hours and is now apparently unusable because it appears to have ransomeware on it and constantly loops with an audio message saying you must call this 888 number.  It is unusable and probably unfixable. I would use it for target practice before I would pay thieves to undo what they have done to its utility (which probably was marginal anyway given the piece of garbage goofy operating system which is 8.1).  Oddly, it started to exhibit the virus within days of being out of return period. Couldn't make a restore disk because it has no disk drive and most USB drives are too small to work. Worst purchase decision I have made in some time. Might have been OK with Windows 7 on it and a restoration USB drive - but only if you use computer primarily for social media."}

The 11 inch screen was too small for her eyes and it had XP preloaded. XP was even obsolete then, but that was what was available for the more simple models. That one wound up being pretty cheaply made with a host of problems popping up over the years. When that one gave out she tasked me with finding her a more suitable basic computer. This product turned out to be a great fit. Not the fastest, but works extremely well and is of very high quality for the price. It is a sturdy machine that should last for a lot longer than the last one. If you are not very advanced with computers and only use your computer for basic tasks like browsing the web or word processing this product will exceed your expectations. If you are a little more advanced and/or demanding in your usage this product should still deliver, especially if you have a tight budget. If you play games that require a lot of resources than this  might not be a good option for you, but great for students and other objective users."}

I've used it for some light gaming (FF7, Papers Please, Minecraft) and it runs fine. I also use it to listen to music and watch videos, which it does pretty well. Getting used to windows 8.1 is kind of difficult, since I'm coming from a machine running vista, but that's not a problem specific to this laptop, so I can't use that against it.\n\nThe keyboard takes some getting use to, but it's not too bad. It could definitely be more responsive though. The track pad and buttons are fine, pretty standard.\n\nThe screen is okay, I've found it's a bit bright for me, so I've been trying to find a good balance with it. I also use f.lux to dim the screen in the evening, which usually helps some. I am still trying to find the sweet spot though.\n\nOverall I would say that if you're looking for a cheap budget laptop that can be used for music, videos, browsing and light gaming, this is a good buy.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a laptop that has the quality of a $2,000 MacBook Pro, then this isn't for you, obviously. If you want $2,000 specs, expect to pay $2,000 instead of leaving a 1 star because you couldn't be bothered to read the product description, or had ridiculous expectations."}

This company is not what it used to be.\n\nI bought this laptop through amazon.com in November 2014 and two months later it stopped working. It won't start. I sent it to Dell for warranty (it expires in June 2016) and today they said the problem is the motherboard and that it's not covered by the warranty because it is a third party piece. &iquest;Third Party, you say? That machine was never opened (otherwise the warranty would be void. In the other hand, if somebody would have opened it they would have realized it by seeing the damaged screws). If the laptop has a third party motherboard they should look at their Chinese manufacturer whom put it in, and if so, Dell is responsible for not doing quality control. If you check the forums on the Internet you will see that the failure of this motherboard is a commonly reported problem. So what does Dell? It tells you that the warranty won't cover this replacement and I must pay $269 to replace the motherboard that THEY PUT ON MY $247 LAPTOP.\n\nI believe this is a scam. Dell USED TO BE a responsible company. Not anymore. Please do not buy neither this nor any Dell product assembled in China. They are crap and then the service is not responding.\nSTAY AWAY FROM DELL!!!"}

So I bought this PC mainly for Quicken. Price was great, there was a numeric keyboard, and it seemed like it would be more than adequate.\n\nTurned it on, set it up, checked for windows updates, got rid of McAfee and put on Avast free, got rid of Internet Explorer and put on Chrome, installed Quicken program, ok. But I noticed that the text on websites was hard to read. Seemed sort of gray. Brightness did not help. Went into display settings, tried to adjust resolution, not possible. Tried to calibrate, received an error message for my trouble. Went to google to ask why I couldn't calibrate, came up with a generic solution to download latest drivers. Went to Dell support site, let it do a system analysis, and voila, there were 13 \"recommended\" drivers, updates, and downloads to perform, almost all requiring a restart. Including the graphics drivers. There was even a bios update, which I downloaded, performed the analysis, and the result was... the new version after flash would be exactly the same as before the flash.\n\nThere was no way to just \"download all\" so I clicked download for each individually. The notes under the file name said \"This file will automatically self-install after downloading\" but that did not happen. I had to go to the downloads folder and click each .exe file individually.\nAfter the installs, and the restart, I found I now had the Intel HD Graphics Control Panel, which made it possible to calibrate, and adjust the display properties.\n\nIn short, the out of box experience left a lot to be desired. I would have thought that one would be able to turn on the computer for the first time and find everything that should be installed by the vendor, would be installed. Updates, ok, but at least install the programs. Lest I be accused of being a Mac fanboy, I easily set up my family's two Acer computers without having to search the Acer website to download drivers and updates just to make the PC function normally.\n\nI like this computer so far, but I think it's asking a lot of the user to have to figure out that he first needs to go to Dell to download and install drivers and updates, restart, just to get the thing to function normally."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "This computer is a basic laptop.  Out of the box the performance was poor.  At times it will appear to run perfectly and very fast.  Then in a slit second the screen will freeze or lag terribly.  This computer is VERY slow out of the box.  I am surprised at how this computer has received such high reviews.  For a basic computer it's ok if you don't mind waiting for things to run or the processer to catch up.  But given the lag out of the box I'm concerned about how much worse it will get after actually adding programs which I have not done yet.\n\nLooking into returning/upgrading this computer.  Dell support has not been much help at this point as there is nothing they can find wrong with this computer.  In the process of asking to return or upgrade it I was transferred 4 times and then was disconnected in the process of another transfer.\n\nIf returning is no longer an option I'll look into rebooting the computer and upgrading the RAM.  Although according to Dell, this computer only supports up to 4GB RAM and are unable to upgrade since there is only one slot even though I've seen other reviews here of people who have done it.\n\nIf buying this computer it would have to be for basic use and I wouldn't expect to add many programs or other items to it and have any performance/speed left."}

Had to send the first one back, it had a loose screw inside it, no problems there. The Thing is slower than I expected but is only used for typing and basic internet games, so suits the purpose it was bought for.\n\nMY main complaint is reserved for windows 8.1.

After a few hours I have to say I'm glad I got it.  No its not slow.  Websites have been quick to load.  I plugged in a thumb drive and it was recognized quickly.  Yes it has no cd/dvd drive but I can read and knew this prior to ordering.  I downloaded the Windows 7 files form Dell just in case I decide that Windows 8 is not for me.  You will need a Windows 7 64bit disc or you can download one as you already have a license for Windows 7.  So just borrow a disc from a friend.  But, give 8 some time, like I will, since it doesn't seen as horrible as some say.  I do ilke 7 better but 8 has done all I 've asked so far so I  might stick around awhile and see what happens.  I laughed at my wife for buying a laptop based on looks.  I bought this one based on the looks, I won't tell her this little tidbit, but I have to say my draw to how it looks aside, it's a fully functional laptop with a nice screen.  Kinda makes me wonder why I bought my new Dell Desktop and Monitor this Christmas.  I love them but this laptop might have worked for most of my needs just as well.\nEdit 1/9/2015 Still love this laptop.  It's like a big Netbook.  Had and ASUS 900HA before this and my aging eyes demanded something bigger.  This Dell continues to impress me even with Windows 8.1.\nEdit 3/14/15  Still rockin Windows 8.1 and love this laptop.  Just get one of the Start Menu replacements and you will forget you have Windows 8.1."}

I bought a laptop for the same price 7 years ago and it out performed this one by far. I don't like the windows 8 interface either. If you are getting it just for web browsing it will work OK but you would be better off with a tablet and if you are getting it for anything else spend more and get anything else."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "I knew the laptop would be slow due to the CPU and the price but is was slower than I expected and my expectations were low.  This is why I knocked off a star.  I will likely try to snag an SSD and/or 8GB RAM on sale to pep it up a bit.  As for the screen, the resolution is nothing outstanding but the screen overall was above my expectations.  For my lack of the proper technical term I will say the screen just \"pops\" and is quite bright.  Battery life is outstanding and the battery is removable which is rare for a laptop in this price range.  The external \"build quality\" is not mac-like but I found it rather impressive for the price.  A nice, slim and relatively light weight laptop.\n\nThe obvious negatives are clearly stated in the description:  No CD/DVD drive, USB 2.0 only and no bluetooth.  Also windows 8.1.\n\nWindows 8.1 (OS on this laptop):\nI really dislike windows 8.1.  I knew it came with 8.1 and I know the general consensus is that it was basically made for a touch screen.  I still wanted to try win 8.1 and I am deeply disappointed for many reasons.  One small reason is that there seems to be no other choice for scrolling than the \"two finger scroll\" or a mouse wheel.  The problem with two finger scroll is that if both fingers do not touch the touchpad at *exactly* the same time then it is interpreted as a single click.  So you are scrolling along and BAM you just clicked on something and off you go.  There is no driver that I could find for this touchpad that would allow me to \"one finger scroll\" aka \"edge scroll\" aka \"linear scroll\".  This is NOT the same as the \"edge swipe\" option that you will find in the touchpad options, that has nothing to do with scrolling.\n\nI did install \"Classic Shell\" which gives it a much more Windows 7 feel (just google it or use your search engine of choice)"}

It's great for the price and gets the job done for what I need it to do, but please be forewarned about a few things:\n\nFirst, if you're not used to Windows 8, this is terribly confusing and difficult to navigate. I'm figuring it out with time, however. Also, there is no CD/DVD drive (not that I needed one, but I've seen quite a few reviews where people returned the laptop for this particular reason, so keep that in mind if you need a drive). Lastly, it's noticeably quite slow. Searching for something on the internet sometimes takes forever, so be prepared to make some upgrades.\n\nWith that said, it's quite handy and useful for my simple needs such as writing, internet surfing, and watching videos. If you're trying to do anything more complicated than that, this is definitely not the laptop for you."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "The first Dell Inspiron shipped to me came had a very noticeable broken pixel right in the middle of the screen.  Thankfully, Amazon replaced that one quickly, free of charge.\n\nUnfortunately, the replacement Inspiron - while fully operational - has been very disappointing.  Despite having a flawless internet connection (as verified by my iPhone, tablet, xbox, etc.), my internet access via this computer is very slow.  It can barely play any video files, particularly streaming videos.  Several times, I have tried to stream a video (such as a Crackle episode) on this computer, only for it to appear extremely choppy and not synchronized with the audio.....then I will stream the same video on my iPhone, and it will stream perfectly.\n\nAlso, Dell consistently tries to get you to sign up for their annoying and unnecessary Face Recognition Password system and McAfee nonsense, even if you uninstall it from your computer.\n\nI've had this computer for a few months now, and it has been unsatisfactory in almost every way."}

It was thinner and large size screen with decent specifications. However, I found even with the faster 2.16 GHz compared to my old laptop at 1.4 GHz, the Dell laptop is unable to keep up with Windows 8 and the apps lag and even close out when it can't keep up. I can barely get any one program going well enough, much less multitask. Not a good laptop considering the OS in my opinion. I ended up selling it back after 2 weeks of trying to fix the speed issue."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "It's a very good laptop, light and easy to use. What I didn't like about it was that, it has no network port, no status lights to say when the hard drive might be busy or if it's powering up. And most of all Windows 8.1 kept crashing a lot, so I installed Windows 7 and it work well after. I think it's a laptop for kids rather than for a business person like myself."}

I thought it did because of the pictures but it doesn't. The processor is SLOW. It's constantly getting bogged down. Sometimes it freezes for a few seconds and decides to open the sidebar. It mistakes a right click for a left one, which is annoying when you want to open something in a new window. Changing between apps is SLOW and if you wanna watch a movie with a lot of action in Netflix, get ready for sketchy motion! What was I expecting, though? I bought it for two hundred. Never making that mistake again. Do yourself a favor and spend more on a better device."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "First of all, as many have said, this is not an I7 nor is it an I3 laptop. I own a Dell laptop with an I3 processor and it works well and of course is faster than this one running at 1.9 ghz. However, I bought this computer for my wife who is not into a lot of hard-core usage. Mainly light browsing, light gaming and emailing along with social networking. For those purposes, you'll be just fine. Please also understand that some modifications have to be made to the laptop as earlier reviewers have stated in reference to better performance. Remove all Dell bloatware including backup and recovery, digital delivery. You'll probably never use them, being that this features are built into the core OS. As far as the mouse goes, my wife and I are exclusively power users. I already knew that no CD drive nor ethernet port was present, but I was fine with that. My wife loves it."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "I went in for a cheap laptop this time because money is tight.  I wasn't expecting much given the price but am a little surprised that Dell put out a product of such poor quality.\n\nThe laptop runs very slow at times and it can get really aggravating.  Internet Explorer crashes and reloads constantly.  Made of cheap plastic, including very loud-clicking mouse buttons that annoyed my roommates in the first twenty minutes of use.  Then there's Windows 8.1 which I personally consider inferior to its predecessors.\n\nLet's discuss FastAccess.  Comes includes with the computer.  Uses the laptop's built-in camera to recognize your face any time you want to log into Windows or any website or program within Windows without having to enter a password.  I liked this concept at first but am ticked off about the execution.  First of all, if you intend to use the program much, it consumes a lot of the laptop's already limited RAM, substantially degrading performance.  Second, the light to my camera went on and off constantly, even when I wasn't trying to log into Windows or an Internet website.  When I tried using the computer's built in picture-taking \"app\" (the word they use now instead of \"program\"), I was not allowed to do so, apparently because of FastAccess.  That is to say, I thought I had uninstalled it successfully but found out later that the program had basically re-installed itself on my computer without even asking my permission.  In summary, the only reason I don't think I have this invasive malware product called FastAccess installed on my computer is because Dell chose to package it with the laptop.\n\nOn the plus side, the computer is able to run older generation PC games like Civ 3 without any trouble.  I'm not sure why it can do that but Internet Explorer has a seizure when I try running four or five tabs at the same time.  Also on the plus side, Microsoft gives you something called OneDrive which is a free cloud storage tool that automatically syncs to the Office products you use on your computer.  This is an awesome, integrated, multi-platform experience that is seamless and of course unbelievably convenient.  Apart from the cost of the Office products themselves, this OneDrive thing comes free with the computer.  A final plus is that it seems easy to download apps although I so far have not explored this option much as quite frankly I don't enjoy being on this laptop.\n\nI don't like to grumble but I have buyer's remorse about this product.  I realize in retrospect I made the purchase based in large part on my respect for Dell's name; I simply did not expect a world class company like Dell to put out a product like this.  I just don't get what the designers' thought process was regarding this computer.  I do have a functioning laptop and this isn't the worst thing that could happen but the disappointment does stick."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "While this is a great deal, there are reasons why it's so cheap. For example, there are only 2 USB ports, and they're all on the left side of the laptop. So if you're right-handed, it is an inconvenience, especially if you plug in a mouse like me. So I can plug in my mouse and my external hard-drive and anytime I want to hook up my iPod, stick flashdrive, or webcam, I have to unplug something. The software runs fast, but it can't handle programs like photoshop, a wacom tablet, or video editing programs. Basically anything heavy-duty is going to crash.\n\nThe biggest issue I have had with this laptop is connecting to the internet. I have only had the laptop for a little over 2 months and it has already had several instances in which it could not connect. At one point it even said that it was connected but then any program that needed internet access to run crashed. All my other devices were connected just fine but the Dell Inspiron is NOTORIOUS for having issues with internet connectivity. Just google \"dell Inspiron 15 won't connect to the internet\" and you will see others are having the same problems.\n\nOverall it runs fast, but I feel very limited to what I can do with this laptop. As a student who only works part-time, I needed something I could afford. Unfortunately, I also needed something that could keep up with my projects at school which require a more hardcore laptop I guess. Oh well, it's great for just ordinary home stuff like writing documents and browsing facebook. Battery life lasts about 4 hours."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "It's pretty basic but it was very inexpensive so for the price you get a decent size hard drive and a pretty nice screen . I want to be fair in my review but I'm having problems primarily because it has windows 8.1 which seems pretty buggy. The initial screen is just a bunch of ads and is completely unnecessary. I had an awful time figuring out how to get rid of it and still be able to access features like shutdown and find files - real complicated stuff. I've had to make several attempts to load normally quick loading pages like Amazon and Google in the last hour, but again, this is a Windows issue. So, for the most part, the computer is fine, it even has a numeric key pad. Unfortunately, I don't like it because I have to shift my hands too far to the left to type. I suppose I will get used to this, but I use this computer on my lap, so now it's off balance. My big surprise, (and I'm going to put this in all caps so other people don't miss it like I did) is: IT DOESN'T HAVE A CD/DVD/OPTICAL DRIVE -  NO DRIVE, NOTHING, JUST A HARD DRIVE. That's it. So I had to order one, which made this computer not quite as inexpensive as I thought. Oh, and get a mouse because if you're using the touch pad, a menu keeps flying out from the entire right side while simultaneously,an oversized time and date sign pops up from the bottom left of the screen almost every time you touch it. What were they thinking?"}

I purchased a USB DVD drive so I can install Windows 7 and other apps that are disk only.\n3) No documentation at all. Its OK for me but you can get the docs from the Dell website.\n4) No install CD's. All the apps and drivers are on the Dell website.\n5) No wired network connection.

Im writing this review on this device as it was shipped to me the only exception being that I am selfhosting Windows 10 technical preview.  That's right.  Not only will this device run Windows 8.1 as it ships with.  It will run Win10 TP just fine.  If you are looking for a super fast gaming device, this isn't your best choice.  If you are looking for a more traditional PC experience than you are getting from your tablet, then this can be a great boost.  It will run the programs you expect and give you a fair sized keyboard to work with.  The performance is generally good for browsing and reading/writing email, but does lag from time to time.  While Ive not analyzed the performance deeply, I know that the hard drive that ships with this device is likely to be the biggest bottleneck.  Many other reviewers, bloggers and vloggers agree with this statement, so you will find many examples of how you can upgrade this device to have a SSD or to increase the RAM.  Both are worthwhile upgrades, but I wanted to see what I would get with the default configuration, and generally Im pleased.  Thanks Dell and Amazon."}

After paying to have my laptop fixed, Dell ended up returning it to their warehouse instead of me.  Their solution was to provide me with a refurbished laptop.  My biggest concern to this was the fact that I had specifically asked for my hard drive not to be reformatted or a new operating system installed.  When I asked Farat Herman, Client Technical Support Specialist, why he could not track my laptop's location at the warehouse, his initial response was that it probably was re-issued to another customer.  However he had no work order or actual proof that it was not sent out with my personal information as well as confidential company information.  When I mentioned this, he then claimed it was probably tagged for destruction.  WHAT????  First it was sent to a customer and now it is tagged for destruction?!?!?!  He really had no idea what was happening with it and tried to placate me with any line he could think of.  In the end I finally said, fine send me a refurb laptop, but I want a refund since I did not get what I paid for since what I paid for was MY laptop back with all of MY information on it.  He said \"No, there is nothing else I can offer, and I speak on behalf of the President of Dell.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "I managed to get this for the \"perfect storm\" price of $179.99.  As usual, timing is everything when buying from Amazon.  I have only used it for a few hours, but so far it meets most of my needs.  The Celeron processor/RAM does show some limitations, such as I was playing a movie using the usually excellent VLC program and  the playback was stuttering and choppy.  Terrible.  I switched to another video program and it was fine.  It reminds me of taking a small 250CC motorcycle on the freeway when you are used to driving a sports car--yes, it will still work, but it is slower and you have to know your limits. For web surfing and word processing, it is totally adequate.  There are some other computers in the price range...HP Stream 11, for example, and I picked the Dell over them because you can expand the RAM to 8GB and it has a 500GB hard drive on the Dell.  The Steam 11 is stuck at 2GB and has a 32GB solid state drive.  Too, small, in my opinion, though you can throw in an SD card and double the storage space.  Also, I preferred the Dell's keyboard, felt less cheap, is full sized and has a 10 key.  I like how the battery is easily replaceable and there is easy access to update the RAM or hard drive.  Downsides?  The Dell feels big, not crazy big, but if all you want is a Starbuck's web surfer, a lighter, smaller 11 or 13 inch laptop would be a little easier to carry around. No DVD reader, but I rarely use them anymore.  No USB 3.0 ports, but as this price break, I can forgive.  And, as others, said, this is not a gaming computer, unless you like Nintendo emulators and that sort of thing.  I managed to run Minecraft and it was playable at lower settings, though the FPS would sometimes dip into the single digits.  I am not of fan of Windows 8.1, especially without a touchscreen...first world problems.  I am very happy to find this computer at under $200, would be less impressed at $250."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "A bit surprised... This machine (and probably all Dell's going forward) does not have a Windows 8.1 Product Key sticker. Instead, according to Dell, the product key is embedded in one of the machine's chip sets. I intended to downgrade two of these cheapo laptops to W7 but after talking to Dell, that doesn't appear to be a viable option. Good news - you never have to remember or keep track of your product key, as long as you make a recovery disc using the Dell Factory Backup bootable recovery disc process. Bad news - Dell won't support the machine until its returned to W8, the drivers are apparently embedded as well, meaning there's strong likelihood there will be conflicts even if you install the W7 drivers, etc. The Dell rep I talked to says their low end machines are all produced like this now, but other processors won't have the problem. I really hate Windows 8 so I guess I'm stuck with two machines that can never be downgraded. Might go ahead and try to see what happens on the non-Celeron machine, but after spending 30 minutes with the (very helpful) Dell rep, I'm not holding my breath.\n\nCouple of other thoughts. This particular model has a Celeron processor. Dell rep said it definitely will give me problems if you downgrade the Celeron-based machines. Picture shows 3 USB ports. Mine has two. There's apparently a bay for a CD/DVD but it's covered by a blank. Not sure if an internal drive can be added, but I bought a LG DVD writer on Amazon for about twenty bucks (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/LG-Electronics-External-Slim-DVDRW/dp/B00AWRTXVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">LG Electronics External Slim DVDRW</a>). Must have a lower powered USB buss as the external DVD drive requires a double Type A USB cable (consuming both USB ports) on this machine, but not on my Dell XPS or wife's higher end Dell laptop. No ethernet port. Bought a USB 3.0 hub/ethernet adapter on Amazon for about fifteen bucks (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/3-USB-3-0-1-Gigabit-Ethernet-Adapter-ZeroLemon-3-Ports-USB-3-0-Bus-Powered-Hub-with-RJ45-10-100-1000-Gigabit-Ethernet-Converter/dp/B00NSEPU46/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">[3*USB 3.0 + 1*Gigabit Ethernet Adapter] ZeroLemon 3 Ports USB 3.0 Bus-Powered Hub with RJ45 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet Converter</a>. The keyboard is not backlit - no surprise there, but it is comfortable and has good tactile response. Both machines came needing a BIOS upgrade. I'd recommend that. Since this machine is for guests and the other is for my garage, I'm ok with the performance. At the end of the day I probably should have spent the extra hundred bucks... But that's what you get these days for just under two-fifty. So, while it's cheap, it's not really a bargain..."}

As mentioned by other reviewers, there is a groove along the bottom edge of the keyboard that scrapes your palms as you use it. It isn't really painful, but it feels scratchy as you move your hands. I don't know why they didn't just smooth down the sharp edge.\n\nAlso, why isn't the touch pad centered on the keyboard?? It is offset to the left, and your finger naturally drifts to the right edge, where the scroll control is. For some reason, this causes the cursor to jump to the far right of the screen, and I find I am constantly having to drag it back to the center.\n\nIt does have a bit of a cheap, plastic feel about it, but I just needed something to make sure my programs work on Windows 8, so for me it was well worth the low price.

Nothing.  Tried taking out the battery and replacing it.  Nothing.  Tried turning it on without the charger plugged in.  NOTHING.  The computer would not start at all.  Just a dead, lifeless paper weight.  We called Dell customer service and they were of ZERO help.  The guy was barely understandable and did not even perform basic troubleshooting options to try and remedy the situation.  When we asked to speak to a supervisor about getting a refund or possibly an upgraded model, he was unresponsive and did not transfer us.\n\nAll in all, this computer is NOT AT ALL WORTH THE CHEAPER PRICE.

Anyway, it was a big deal for me for a bit because I needed my Wacom Bamboo Create tablet's cd to download so, I was freaking out. So, Wacom users fear not there is a wed site were you can have ur drawing tablet install and it will work. Wacom Bamboo tablet does work on the laptop!!!!

I am not a computer tech just throwing it out there so yeah.\nAnyway, the reason I give four stars bc windows 8 is a bit sucky.

I installed our Office 10 on it and runs without issue, no lagging at all. My 16 year old ended up taking over the machine and has had no complaints so far.\n\nBasic set up for the system is very basic, starting with the Celeron dual core processor.  These Celeron units run cool enough that it does not need a system fan which cuts down on vibration and noise.  There is NO cd-rom on these machines.  If you need one, pick up a USB 2.0 external drive.  The memory is a 4gig Single Channel DDR3 1600MHz chip and can be upgraded very easily to an 8gig Single Channel DDR3 1600MHz which will improve performance (this can be done by taking the back compartment off of the machine, there are youtube videos how to do it).  The wireless card is a Dell Wireless 1506 and is also an upgrade option, but in this case you have to take off the keyboard to upgrade it (there is also a youtube video on how to do this as well).  From my understanding the Intel 7260 H/T Dual Band 2x2 adapter will work in the machine (first download drivers from intel and store them on the machine before installing, drivers are not native). I will be testing the dual band wireless adapter as soon as it gets here.  The hard drive is an SATA II - 500gb 5600 RPM drive.  It can be upgraded to a 'slim SSD', or slim solid state drive, which will also speed up the system performance, although this is only recommended for those who know about cloning drives, or feel comfortable reinstalling windows.  The memory and wireless card upgrades are both easy and will make an improvement to the system performance.\n\nThe first system purchased on 8/4 is still going strong and I just picked up a second one from the Dell doorbuster sale for $200 after taxes.\n\nUpdate 12/15/2014 - the Intel 7260 H/T Dual Band 2x2 wireless network adapater works great, improves performance of the machine greatly as the stock card is basically a bottom of the barrel card.\n\nAnyone who wants to boost performance quite easily should look into the wireless neetwork card (roughly $30) and the memory upgrade (roughtly $70).  That extra $100 spent will make the machine perform like a much more expensive device."}

The fit and finish is more than solid in this price range...the build, sturdiness, and durability is excellent. Not cheaply made nor does it look cheap. Has a nice black corrugated finish to limit fingerprints. Very responsive when processing data. Keyboard is extremely well built and organized. No clicking of keys...very quiet as you type. Runs silent, no heat emitted. Hardware is basic (no optical drive) and very friendly to access. Battery time is 6 hours  +/- and charges fast. Touch pad gets some getting use to but it does come with a sensitivity touch control, There is the basic bloatware that you will want to delete. 8.1 windows is not difficult but fun. Many people continue to complain about 8.1 and I have no idea what they are talking about...I'm not a pc geek at all.  To me, Dell has made a very, very good laptop and a winner. I've looked at many laptops and this one is tops in just about everything. It would be a mistake not to purchase this model...for $250 you should stop looking now. Excellent all the way. LB"}

This maxed out the processor, which is too weak to be running Windows 8.1. I clocked how long it took to load this shopping website: more than 60 seconds to display all of the images. That's not malware or anything, that's just the combination of running Avira antivirus and Chrome at the same time, even with display properties set to maximize performance and bloatware removed. Lots of basic tasks, (installing Microsoft Office, running antivirus scans), time out and fail because the processor is so slow. It could be I got a sub-par processor shipped in mine, or maybe pre-installed Dell touchpad and sound software hog unacceptable resources, or (more likely) these laptop manufacturers should just stop trying to push Windows 8 on dual-core Celerons - the hardware just can't handle the software."}

I spent about a week looking at reviews and checking out different laptops, but what made the difference for me was ultimately, the price. When this laptop dropped $30 to $219, I decided it was worth the shot. I'm glad I did!\n\nI use the laptop for social networking, online schooling (which requires a ton of legal research), webcamming, and the general mom/student uses. I've been using it about a week now and haven't had a single problem with it. The battery lasts longer than any of the other iPads/laptops in my house. As a matter of fact, while I am almost constantly charging all of the other computers, I haven't had this one die on me yet. I charge it at night and whenever I'm not using it and haven't had a problem otherwise.\n\nThe size of the computer itself is awesome! It has a full keyboard, including a number keypad, and a large mouse pad that's simple to use. I also love that it is not a touchscreen, because when my 3 year old comes up trying to touch the screen, it's nice that it does not respond. It has 2 USB and 1 HDMI port, and no fan sound that I've been able to hear. I'm far from a computer whiz, but it definitely meets all of my needs!"}

It pretty much does what he needs but is lacking the bluetooth to use a portable bluetooth speaker.  I still am trying to find out from Dell just what \"bluetooth tied to the wireless\" means.  It seems to mean no bluetooth at all.  I build my own computers and use a macbook pro for a laptop myself so I'm pretty computer savvy.  I cleaned out all the extra garbage from the software and changed out the 4 gig RAM to 8 gigs.  I can't see adding an SSD drive at this price point but it would certainly speed things up.  If you really need a faster computer get one with a better processor before you spend extra money on too many upgrades for a cheaper laptop like this.  If you want Windows 7 it will cost you another $80 or more.  This is my first exposure to windows 8.1 and I have to say I'm really glad I have been putting only windows 7 on my computers (I built a high end PC this summer with windows 7).  It's every bit as bad as it's reputation as far as I'm concerned.\n\nYou will find reviews for this Dell all over the 1-5 star range.  Some people have higher expectations for a laptop and other people are just happy if they can get on the internet.  I would never be happy with this particular model myself as the case is cheap and feels like it won't last very long.  But if you are on a tight budget then you will get some decent functionality for your money.  If you plan to use the laptop for more than browsing and watching movies then you might consider it a waste of $250.  If you are less demanding this can be a good deal on an entry level laptop.\n\nI don't believe I would take this particular laptop and put in 8 gigs of RAM ($75), an SSD ($100), and Windows 7 ($80) for a total of $250 or more of upgrades.  It would make the laptop much faster but the processor, case and display are not what you can get in a better laptop for $500.  Just save yourself the work and get a nicer machine from the start."}

It is very fast and loads very quickly.\n\nThe screen quality is very good. For some videos and movies you can adjust to 1080p. The sound is very good and clear, it can be adjusted as well to music, movies, games, etc. Comes with preset for music and has an equalizer. To get this click on the audio icon found in the notification area. Or menu and/or search. It plays various different types of games in very good sound and quality. Good graphics. However, it might not be as good for heavier games such as for gamers.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "Don't expect anything speedy, but it works ok.  Still some noticeable delay when clicking on things, but I may be able to improve that by uninstalling some of the bloatware that came pre-installed.\n\nAlso, don't expect:\nA CD/DVD drive\nA port to plug your monitor into (unless you have an HDMI connection)\nMore than two USB ports\nA sturdy keyboard... this one feels like pretty cheap plastic\n\nOn the somewhat positive side, the battery that I received in the laptop would not charge, though the laptop would boot while I was plugged in.  I called Dell support, and talked to a very friendly technician who spoke perfect English (not something I expected from a tech support line).  The battery was on back order, but she has been keeping me updated on the progress and it looks like the battery was just shipped today.  So, I will be without a battery for about the first two weeks.  I can live with it for the price.  I'm not sure if this is a common problem with this model though."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "I bought this laptop, because I needed one and I didn't have the money to buy another 500 dollar model. I was concerned about the speed and whether it would be fast enough for what I did. I do play many old games like Big Fish or Shockwave type games. It works well enough for those. Sometimes it runs slow during web surfing but I think it is related to the webpage. I did set the computer to performance rather than energy saver which I believe improves it's speed. It can be upgraded with 8 gigs of ram. That is something other computers in the price range didn't allow. They also didn't allow other upgrades like changing the battery out of the hard drive.\nWhile this only has two USB connectors number 2, no ethernet connector, or ethernet port, I have those on my other computers and don't use them. One can get a hub for more connectors or to add an ethernet connector. It didn't come with a DVD drive. I will be getting an external one. I don't use my dvd drives very much, even on my other computer.\n\nSometimes we need a less expensive computer. What is great about this is you can have one, without going to Google Chrome to get one. And I am adapting to WIndows 8.1. I had to do some research to learn how to do things but after a while it becomes intuitive. And there are nice benefits to switching, such as having an alarm on the computer as an app, using your laptop to control your Roku Device, having a podcast App, or downloading games from the Microsoft store. I am liking this computer more and more and though it doesn't have what more expensive ones have, it is good when you are on a limited budget and you really need one. It is a nice computer with a great screen. It is comfortable to type on it. And it is very stable.\n\nAnother good function I have discovered with this, is that I can pair it with Youtube on my Smart TV, enabling me to watch Youtube videos from this lap top onto my TV. This is helpful because I do homeschool my children and they can watch educational videos if they need to have something explained, visually."}

If you are not on the road a lot or for a longer battery life, never ever touch the Celeron processor. There is nothing wrong with the computer. It is just too slow. You get what you pay for. I bought it after I saw very good consumer reviews. My old one was DELL Latitude D630 died. It was very fast. I will stay with DELL. But other models."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "Why does this computer have an HDMI output? I have no idea. Maybe if your only interest is the browse the web (and even then) this is a pretty useless computer. So, intel makes a few different types of integrated graphics (ex. intel hd 3000, intel hd 4000, etc). I own a laptop with intel HD 4000, which works very very well and can even play some decent older games (like skyrim). But, this comes with plain Intel HD (no number). I just wanted a media laptop to play movies (streaming and downloaded from amazon and such). I put this to play a 1080p and it just kept stuttering and stuttering, i looked it up and tried a few remedies such as setting the power to performance and setting graphics to max and all that, but it still stuttered. Streaming was worst. I figured anything would be able to play movies now a days, but i was very very wrong.\nI'm not sure what you would want this for, but i figure everybody probably wants to be able to play a movie, if that is your goal, look elsewhere, maybe if you are playing non-hd movies, but what is the fun in that?"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "(Updated) (Updated again) Let's start with answering the only question I had about this computer: \"Can I add an internal optical drive inside the plastic spacer, or even maybe a second HDD with a caddy?\". The answer is \"No, you can not! There is no SATA connector behind the spacer\".\n\nOn the other hand, it is very much upgrade-friendly. The minute I got it out of the box, I took out hard drive and cloned it onto SSD I have, so this machine runs with Crucial M500 SSD now. You can also upgrade to 8 Gb of RAM, but I wouldn't bother, really.\n\nI am blown by the quality of the product. Screen, trackpad and build quality are exceptional for $220 that I paid for this machine. $220 is a sweet price for this, and I think it blows away any competition, but read on!\n\nCase is plastic, but very pleasant to touch. Good keyboard, trackpad looks durable, screen is very decent, too. Not 180 degrees viewing angles, but very good anyway.\n\nPros:\n- Upgrade-friendly! HDD and RAM are easily accessible, and service manual is easy to get\n- Nice quiet keyboard\n- Quality screen\n- Good trackpad\n- Quite snappy\n- Build quality\n- Light\n- Quiet and cool (in fact, it's absolutely silent with SSD)\n\nCons:\n- No optical drive (keep that in mind)\n- Fingerprint magnet, but not too bad\n- Trackpad buttons make relatively loud \"click\"\n- You need to get rid of pre-installed antivirus, otherwise it's too slow (use standard Windows Defender instead)\n- Only 2 USB ports, and they are USB 2.0\n- I hate Dell trackpad driver! remember, FIRST thing you need to do is go into trackpad settings and disable one-finger gestures! Otherwise it's almost unusable.\n\nBut seriously, for sub-$250 laptop that is very good. I owned a Chromebook before, a few models, and this one beats them both in functionality, build quality and (some) price.\n\nIf you are looking at Chromebooks, look at this machine, too! It can run Skype and proper Windows applications, and easy to upgrade. HP Stream 11 and 13 may be decent alternatives, too, but if you are looking for classic black color, and classic big screen you can easily read, Dell is your choice.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nUpdate 1: Make sure you install a driver for card reader from Dell website. Out of the box it has a wrong driver, and reads cards quite slowly. After updating driver, it's up to decent speeds!\n\nUpdate 2: I am very, very pleased with the purchase! Completely silent and very fast with SSD! Copying photos from SD card - very quick! Editing and browsing in Google Picasa - amazingly quick. Plays 1080p without issues! And most surprisingly, even when CPU is 100% loaded, no noticeable degradation of performance, I don't know how they achieved this. Microsoft Office (Word, Excel) - very snappy.\n\nUpdate 3: For a couple of weeks now, this has been my multimedia centre! Connected via HDMI to my HD TV, watching TV series on-line. No issues whatsoever! Snappy, battery lasts forever, smooth and pleasant playback. Seriously thinking about selling my multimedia PC now :)\n\nSo once again, here's what you need to do to get the most out of this machine:\n- Uninstall McAffee software (enable Windows Defender instead)\n- Disable 1-finger gestures for the touchpad (review all other touchpad settings, too)\n- Get drivers for WiFi and card reader from Dell website, and install them\n- Create a factory backup flash drive in Dell Backup and Restore, and..\n- Upgrade to SSD if you can, it will make a huge difference! Laptop is upgrade-friendly.\n\nHope this is helpful!"}

There isn't even an option to roll back to an earlier version of windows as with most window based platforms and now windows makes you rent windows office suites either on a monthly or annual basis so you never really own your own software which is a RIP OFF in itself. The laptops speed is okay and I guess if all I was interested in was streaming movies or playing games it would fill the bill but I have real work to do and this purchase was a big disappointment in what I have come to expect from Dell and Windows products."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "So this was my first windows computer I have bought in a while. I was excited with the new version of windows that security was going to be less of an issue.  So after setting up all my software, uninstalling all the crap that Dell sticks on this machine ... I wanted to double check that the hard drive was encrypted, I had read that this is the default setting for Windows 8.1.  My main fear with a laptop is it gets stolen, and I want to make sure whoever steals it can't get at all the websites I use on daily basis.\n\nLow and behold the drive isn't encrypted, so I look around for Bitlocker so I can turn it on.  Whoops, Bitlocker doesn't come with the version of windows that is on this computer.  So in 2014 and using Microsofts latest OS I cannot encrypt my hard drive.  Digging a little deeper I find that its quite easy to get past the password security that windows uses on startup, so my computer is basically completely vulnerable.\n\nSo in a state of disbelief I realize I will have to upgrade my version of windows for $100.  I click on the new Windows screens that are supposed to make this really straight forward and I get a blue screen that says \"BUYING ONLINE IS NOT ACTIVE IN YOUR REGION, TRY GOING TO AN ELECTRONICS STORE\".  For the record my region is Seattle, where Microsoft's HQ is located.  So I look around some more and find lots of forums talking about people that tried to upgrade and paid the money but couldn't make it work.\n\nSo I look into 3rd party disk encryption and after trying one of the most popular open source ones out the computer is now unbootable.  Since Dell provided no bootable disks with this computer  I have now taken this computer and tossed it into the garbage.  On one hand I wasted $250 and a lot of time with a horribly designed OS ... but on the other hand I got the reminder I needed to never buy a Microsoft product for the remainder of my life.  So I think net net, this was a win."}

I like the way the desktop is set up, organized, important shortcuts show up right away.  I haven't used it much yet because I'm saving it for school.\n\nThe reason I gave it four stars instead of 5 is that it has no c.d. player and Microsoft office has to be downloaded onto it as an add-on, but I knew that when I bought the laptop.

I just don't have time to sit for hours to get something transitioned for me.  Having said that, I dreaded changing out my 5 yr old Dell netbook for this puppy, but the netbook had just had it, so I jumped in.  I also dreaded the Windows 8.1, since I had heard that it was pretty complex.  So, when I bought this pc, I also invested a couple bucks in a used 8.1 for Dummies book from Amazon.  To say I'm surprised and pleased is putting it mildly.  About one week later, the pc is running like a champ, I'm on my network easily and now so use to the 8.1 setup, I don't think I could go back.  And  I haven't opened the book yet.\nI still need to explore the Office works part..haven't had time or need.  I have AOL email, so I need to figure out if I just want to leave that on my iPhone 5C....right now is pretty convenient as is.  So I've set up all my Favorite websites and am off and running.  I like when I bring up the Start Up Screen and logon...so easy....and see the whole world on one screen...sports headlines, latest news (all with photos running), health/fitness news, recipes....awesome.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "I use it all the time. A great deal. But some warnings: (1) no vga output, hdmi. So to use your VGA monitor, get a HDMI to VGA adapter from amazon: VicTsing 1080P HDMI Male to VGA Female Video Converter Adapter Cable. Also, there are no conventional headset jacks, instead there is a versatile stereo jack. In order to use a standard headset microphone, you need to buy an adapter which on one end has a male stereo connector like you might use on your smartphone, and on the other end there are mono headphone and microphone jacks. I also found that when trying to use DOSBOX to I could run my old DOS text based applications, the Dell intercepted the function keys (like F4). There is a BIOS setting to allow the function keys to work without interception.... One problem I have not solved, I like to put Linux on a partition, and I made a partition, but I can not get the Dell to boot off a USB memory stick to install Linux in that partition. I really like dual boot with two operating systems.\n\nThe laptop works just fine, it is not heavy so I can carry it while traveling. It has a big screen and decent keyboard. However, the mouse pad \"jumps around a lot\" for me, so I always use an external mouse. I am now using it dual display, extending the desktop into the second display, using the aforementioned HDMI to VGA adapter. It works fine.\n\nTo adapt the audio jack to a headset microphone, use something like StarTech.com MUYHSMFF 3.5mm 4-Pin to 2x 3-Pin 3.5mm Headset Splitter Adapter - M/F"}

However, keep in mind that this computer does not come with a DVD tray or Ethernet port. At first, I was planning to get a tablet to surf the web, but tablets are very expensive for the few functions they provide. Although this computer is not powerful, it doesn't need to be. If you want a powerful computer, then go BUILD your own desktop. High performance laptops are a big waste of money, x4 the price of a desktop and x0.5 the power. If you need computing power, then build a $600 desktop for gaming and other heavy processing tasks. Back to the topic, I find this computer light and comfortable to carry (for a size reference it will not fit into the laptop holder of the NorthFace Recon and will likely be a tight fit in 15in laptop compartments). The screen of the laptop has decent pixel density (max 1366x768). It's not as good as my desktop monitor's resolution (1920x1080), but you will get used to it in a week. The battery life is around 3 - 4 hours during actual use (word processing, surfing the web, ect). The advertised battery life is probably taken at the lowest brightness, with no applications running, and with WiFi turned off. This computer is for people who want a computer for mobile word processing and web surfing. I use this laptop for taking notes in college; it works extremely well. I felt bad seeing other people wasting money on $800- $1500 laptops, you can get this computer and a powerful desktop for that much. Feel free to ask about anything else that I forgot to mention."}

If you want to buy this laptop for Linux Ubuntu and you know your way around Linux fairly well, then this computer may be great for you."}

You can use it to surf the web, see movies on netflix, youtube, write a paper, with no issues, and its fast for that kinds of stuff. For gaming it doesn't work at all since CPU delivers the graphics and it doesn't have enough firepower for that.  I thought that it wouldn't be able to open multiple programs at once and have a smooth experience or that it would be extremely sluggish, but it isn't slow at all, it does everything rather well.\n\nThe computer looks good, its thin and lightweight. It feels very rigid, not flimsy at all, and it doesn't feel cheap. If you didn't know the price you'd think it was a 500 or 600 dollar PC. The battery on this thing lasts forever. But it does come with a few issues, the number keys on the right fail to respond quite a lot. Maybe its my computer, but if you're an accountant or work a lot with numbers using the right side then you might have a problem if this is a general problem. Also I haven't been able to plug in an external hard drive successfully, it doesn't recognize it (I don't know if its a hardware or Windows 8 issue), but I plugged the same hard drive on a mac and it worked instantly. It reads thumb drives fine.\n\nThe 2 main issues I have with it is that it has Windows 8 (but all new PC's have Windows 8), and that it doesn't have a CD/DVD bay, but I knew that before I bought it. If you plan using this computer as a computer for normal web browsing, watching movies, listening to music, writing papers, or working in excel, then you shouldn't have any problems. I use LibreOffice and it works great, I don't have Microsoft Office so I'm not sure how it would run but I guess it should run great."}

The original reason I considered returning it was due to the lack of the responsiveness of the keyboard, however, I, like some other folks that bought this model, was frustrated with Windows 8. I will note that I have owned multiple Inspirons over the years both high end and low end and for the most part have been satisfied. I'm actually typing this review on an Inspiron N4110 that I picked up on sell at Best Buy about 3 years ago and have been satisfied with.\n\nAs I said, the main problem with this model is the keys just seem to have \"clunky\" feel. It seems to take more pressure to push them down than the keyboard I'm using now and I have noticed my typing speed is slower and I make more typos. As others have noted in their reviews of this item the cursor pad seems a bit sluggish and the buttons make an audible click that is distracting.\n\nAs noted in my original review I'm not familiar with Windows 8 having used Windows 7 for the past few years. That said, I found the transition to Windows 8 a bit difficult and the changes don't lend themselves to intuitive learning based on previous editions. Having all program and application icons, weather, email, etc. appear in random order of tiles of different sizes is just confusing and I much preferred the more organized tool bar that showed all programs and only popped up when you clicked it. I think this may have finally been the Windows straw that broke the camel's back (sorry for mixing my metaphors) and I think I am ready to make the leap to an Apple Mac now.\n\nI must add that I was very impressed with Amazon's responsiveness to my returning this item. I sent an email the day after I received it expressing my concerns and I received a response in a couple of hours. I was provided with instructions on how to return and also the customer service representative also extended my Prime membership by 1 month to make up for the inconvenience. I dropped the laptop off at UPS with the prepaid label that Amazon provided and by the time I got home about 20 minutes later Amazon had already refunded the money to my debit card!\n\nHope this is helpful\n\nMike"}

Yes one red pixel was stuck on the whole time. I tried a myriad of different strategies I found online to try to fix it and yet it wouldn't go away. So after about a day of different attempts and repeated failures I decided to return it.\n\nTry 2\nComputer comes on time. Works out of the box. Little sluggish as usual but tolerable and workable. Within a week the computer started having strange browser issues. The computer, despite having a working internet connection, wouldn't load webpages. Tried multiple browsers, same problem existed. The pages would just be in continual loading phase. Tried re-installing the wifi drivers to no avail. Tried installing windows updates, no help. Tried windows recovery to an earlier time, still nothing.\n\nOne lemon is a bad sign but a statistical inevitability. Two lemons in a row is a clear sign of crummy computers with poor construction and reliability.\n\nOther Notes: Even after the first use of the computer it is notable that the computer is a bit slow, even right out of the box. Now if you're buying a computer for under $300 you should fully expect this, but be sure to be able to gauge your tolerance for it. Once a few programs are running and every time you click you have to wait several seconds before anything happens at all. If you try to watch full screen videos on YouTube the computer gets a bit overwhelmed and will lag fairly often. It can start to wear on you pretty quickly. For this reason I think I'm going to get at least an i3 processor next time around.\nAlso this computer comes with a bit of spyware/malware that should be removed right off the bat. All in all, more trouble than it's worth.\n\nI depend on other consumers for their truthful and detailed experience so I don't have to go into trouble of having a product that is not adequate. So as always, if you found this review helpful, click and vote YES so, that others will know! It makes me happy to know, that I have helped somebody on their decision based on my review. Thank you and have a great day."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "As someone who has been in the technology field for 15+ years now, I'm always picky about hardware for myself. I was looking at this laptop for my wife and given that she doesn't use a computer all that often, I didn't want to break the bank for something that sits.\n\nAfter getting this & going through all the setup for it, I would say that if I were shopping for me, I'd have bought this same laptop. Unless you're using this for hardcore gaming, this machine has plenty of horsepower for everyday use. If you want it that much faster, I'd just swap a SSD in place of the current HD to get the extra speed. Otherwise, this is fine.\n\nI would recommend going through and uninstalling all the crap that PC manufacturers install these days, including the anti-virus software. McAfee slows things waaaay down and with this setup, you don't need that kind of hog. Once you uninstall it, Windows Defender is on and it will cover you just the same without using up more unnecessary resources.\n\nMicrosoft gives you SkyDrive space with a windows ID you can create during the setup of Win 8. You can add it to your iDevice as well, in order to sync your photos and everything between devices.\n\nOne major perk to this laptop is that it has a replaceable battery. Most low cost laptops I looked at did not, so when the battery had problems you were limited in just having a plugged in laptop, which cuts the usefulness of having a laptop to begin with.\n\nThere is no DVD drive, but that's also par for what current manufacturers are doing for laptops.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a great laptop for people who aren't looking to drop $500+ for a machine they won't use all that often. Also would be good for students, as it runs office & internet apps just fine."}

No other store had a better price! I also bought the 2-year accidental damage warranty for less than $50! I KNOW she's probably going to drop it at some point! And it came with Windows 8.1, a better version than Windows 8. ONE NOTE: It only comes with a 30-day TRIAL of the Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel, & Powerpoint). After the trial, you can buy the suite for $150.00. As an alternative, I found Apache OpenOffice that you can download for free with all the same functions! Of course it's not quite as good as Word, but I couldn't afford another $150 for a $250 laptop! Luckily my oldest daughter still had one free Word Suite installation left for her Microsoft Word 2007 Suite, so we installed that. And it turned out, that after all my extensive research, this Dell Inspiron 15 is the same laptop that my middle daughter has, and she loves it! But do read the reviews...some people had some very good suggestions to make this laptop fun faster."}

I was in the market for a great laptop and this one definitely fits the bill. This laptop is lightweight and thinner than previous versions of the Dell Inspiron. Once you boot up this device you will notice right away the sharp images this laptop can display. The screen is large (15.6\") and will allow you to do anything you could do on a desktop. The screen displays at 768p (1366x768) HD. This laptop is filled with many more great features. I have listed a few that I felt were important for you to know before making a purchase. They are as follows:\n\n* Processor: Intel Celeron N2830, 2.16 GHz\n* Display: LCD 15.6\" HD\n* Memory (RAM): 4 GB DDR3\n* Storage (hard drive): 500 GB Hard Drive (More than enough space)\n* Optical Drive: Tray load DVD Drive\n\nAgain I think you will love this laptop like I do and I would definitely recommend it.\n\nThank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "The perks of the system are as follows:\n\n1. Intuitive touch-pad functionality: The touch-pad can be difficult to work with, but with support for 4-finger macros with the included touch-pad software for multiple functions and macros. (Macros are shortcuts that can be toggled according to a configuration)\n\n2.  Low power consumption. Windows 8.1 has showed the battery life at 12 hours and 36 minutes countless numbers of time after reducing the maximum CPU load to 50% of the offered capability with the back-light panel set to 20% - 29% and idle. Ubuntu 14.04 LTS has shown between 5 to 6 hours on a full charge. (I'm not certain if Ubuntu just uses more resources along-side Compiz compositing and the Unity environment)\n\n3. The temperatures according to Almico Speedfan has showed between 29 Celsius and 50 Celsius depending on the load and the power settings. Ubuntu 14.04 LTS has pushed between 38 Celsius and 55 Celsius depending on the load and environment settings.\n\n4. The laptop comes with an expansion for adding in an optical drive, and it can support up to 8GB with a single 1033 MHz DDR3 SODIMM module. (It initially comes with a single 4GB 1033 MHz DDR3 SODIMM module that consumes a low amount of voltage)\n\nWhat I don't recommend you do with this laptop:\n\n1. Stream HD videos through Adobe Flash Player. (I recommend HTML5 if you have the option)\n\n2. Run Google Chrome with a few extensions. (It will eat up the processor's power and your RAM)\n\n3. Turn it into a hackintosh project. (It can support a few modified systems, but you'll end up with a bad overall experience as performance will drop significantly, it will take a long time to boot into OS X, and it will also eat up more battery power lowering the overall battery life to 3 hours and 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on the CPU load)\n\nFor the price, this isn't a bad laptop. There's plenty of functionality with a surprisingly nice touch-pad and wireless network capabilities.\n\nThe laptop loses a star for the lack of an Ethernet port, it would have helped me quite a bit when installing Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Niresh OS X 10.7.3."}

I would not buy this product again and it's too late to send it back.\n\nAfter spending more time with it, I think it's ok but just barely. The sound crackle is still there, but sometimes not. Lag problems persist, the swirly wheel is almost a constant companion. Unresponsive, explorer keeps getting stuck, closes, yet sometimes for a day or two it runs great. I maintain a well regarded anti virus program which I removed then reinstalled since there was no performance improvement. I'm not a gamer, have hardly any apps or programs other than office productivity stuff. I'm pretty good with computers, sometimes I build my own. Most of the difficulty seems point to the Fast Access face recognition software, which is neither. The hardware is inadequate to run this program, it's slooooow on this machine, the light is too tiny, almost never recognizes my face. It's a PIA, I removed it completely three times, came back each time in maybe a day or two thanks to Dell updates. The fourth time Dell tech took control of my computer and supposedly erased all registry files but FastAccess? ...yep, it reinstalled itself yet again. Keeps coming back like a bad penny.\n\nI think it's a combination of Windows 8 not being ideally suited for this machine, plus Dell keeps re-installing through 'updates' programs that the customer doesn't want. The lags and stutters and general unresponsiveness that comes and goes...Dell Detect made no difference, so who knows.\n\nI'd avoid this one."}

This was the deal-breaker for me and is the reason why I'll be returning mine.\n-1080p video (both streaming and local) is choppy to the point where I don't want to watch it, although I believe it only has 720 lines of resolution anyway. Content at 720p was borderlining on acceptable.\n-The trackpad is okay for simple pointing and clicking, but multi-touch gestures are mostly unusable.\n-The speakers are quiet and tinny.\n-It's a fingerprint magnet...although I do like the look of the casing otherwise!"}

I had windows installed on my mac via boot camp, but I found it convenient to hop back and forth between operating systems, and furthermore, boot camp was wasting precious hard drive space on my mac. The solution was this computer. It was a very basic, no frills, work machine and suits my purposes perfectly. I have no need to run any high end games or photo editing software. I merely needed this computer to run Microsoft office, financial software, and basic web browsing. For $250, it has been a steal! To turn it into a desktop, I hooked it up to a usb hub, with usb mouse and keyboard and an external monitor with a hdmi to vga adapter, and was able to replicate a dual monitor setup similar to the one I have a work as well.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "I really love how smooth and fast this laptop is. If I had my choice, I would have liked an operating system 7 instead though. I thought I would try this out because I'd never used the other before. I don't really care for the layout of it and I have some issues finding what I want. The track pad is nice and big, but the touch on it is so touchy I'm accidentally changing screens and opening windows when I don't want to. As for the overall computer, it's very fast, never gets hot and has an awesome battery life (at least 4 hours +)\nI also love the keyboard. Each key is sorta separated, instead of side by side, which I like a lot. It has a very sleek design and it's pretty light weight as well. I would recommend this laptop for anyone that just does basic stuff. I do not yet have any programs on here like photoshop, I'm sure it would run it, but I didn't want to bog it down. However, I have watched Netflix and it runs so smooth it's like a TV. Nothing lagged, never git hot on my lap and it didn't take a long time to load either. It doesn't have an optical drive, but that'd make the price go up more. You can always purchase one though because it does have a place for it on the side.\nSo, complaint wise, I don't love the operating system. Oh, and when start up came for the first time it took over an hour to get it working. It actually ended up locking up and a friend had to help me. He too had this issue when starting it for the first time. After that though it was smooth sailing."}

Way way lighter than the 8 year old Inspiron 1501 it replaced, it fires up fast, runs very quiet, doesn't get hot, and shuts down like right now. Is it stupid fast? No. It's not a 900 dollar computer. Can it stream videos like Netflix and Youtube? You bet. Can it hold, sort, and edit a bazillion photos and video files? No problem. Upload or download anything I need? Most certainly. What don't I like about it? Can't think of anything. Most of the negative reviews are coming from folks who expect way too much from a 250 dollar unit. If you want high performance, spend a lot more and buy a high performance laptop. But if you want an inexpensive, lightweight, super thin, all around surfing machine, this baby does the trick."}

Basically stating that if you are going to use this laptop to check your email, browse the internet and watch a couple of youtube videos, you should be fine.\n\nWell, I wasn't fine.  Not all webpages contain the same material.  Sometimes I have to download large pdf files or powerpoint presentations and this thing does not do the trick.  Also, youtube now has a lot of 1080p videos, not to mention 2k and 4K!  This laptop is sooooo slow!  and so heavy!!!\n\nIf you are planning to give this laptop to your recent college student, think again.  In order to become a recent laptop you would need to upgrade pretty much everything.  I remember when I started college (7 years ago) I got a really nice HP laptop from my parents.  Well, that laptop is still with me and works a lot faster than this Dell.  Unfortunately, it still operates Windows Vista and I wanted an upgrade too and I didn't want to spend the big bucks on a new laptop.\n\nInstead a got a great Lenovo i7, with SSD and 8gb of RAm for $750.  I am really pleased with this new laptop and streaming is amazing.\n\nUnfortunately, if you want decent things in life you are going to have to spend."}

I'm also not a fan of Windows 8, but fortunately I can install whatever I want on the laptop without issue.\n\nUpdate (1/15/2015) - I'm dropping my review to one star. The reason? After six months, the laptop is no longer able to charge its battery. After performing research online, I've learned that this is a common problem with this particular model. I do not recommend this laptop if you actually want something that will last. Amazon will not allow a return, so I'll need to send it off to Dell and wait for a replacement."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "I think this laptop is meh. I actually got it as a graduation gift for college, from my dad, which is one of the reasons I do like it. But, that being said I've only owned for a year and I've been taking good care of it, even bought a protector for it. Anyways, despite my precautions this thing is just bad built, physically speaking.. which I guess is to expect for the low price but wow. The little plugs that hold the screen together started getting loose only after maybe 2 months of me owning it, which led to the lcd screen one day breaking on me because I unintentionally grabbed the laptop by the screen and since it was loose because the plugs were sliding off, the lcd cracked on the inside. I had to send it to dell and they fixed the lcd but did not fix the loose plug problem. They just put glue and put it back together. So I still remain with loose plugs and a sticky frame around the screen from the plug glue gliding around, it's horrible. Lately I've noticed the air vent on the side, the frame around also breaking off piece by piece every time I pick up my laptop I have to be super careful because if not, then crack!.... Just now I noticed out of nowhere that the cap around the hinge that opens the screen also came off, I have no idea how, I have not even dropped this laptop once. So, honestly, I'd say save up and getting a better quality laptop from the start, because the cheap in the end is expensive. Right now I have to handle it like sensitive glass so that it won't break on me, because fixing is not cheap. The only pro I have for it, is that it does it's job, runs smooth, comes with windows 8 which isn't so bad once you get used to it.. but yea I'd skip on this one!"}

The normal speed I get though is at around 1.2GHZ-1.5GHz. Im okay with it but it does bother me sometimes when it lags. I would worry about that because like I said, this is not a high end gaming computer and is basically made for simple tasks and not heavy graphics. I play Dota 2 and Gmod on this along with some steam games and they perform quite well. Lags a BIT but if you play around with the game settings then you can get the perfect one to run it smoothly. I have all my settings on medium. Sometimes on high but then again. it lags very little for me. Just take care of your laptop and don't just download anything on it.

I built my own gaming pc with a intel i5-4590 in it and a gtx 760 so I know what crazy performance on a computer can come to. However, this laptop far exceeded my expectations when I bought it for college, I only use Malwarebytes and Microsoft Security Essentials, run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years. For $250, which is as much as my graphics card alone cost, this laptop is an incredible value. It is quite impressive at multitasking, which really surprised me. I can have tabs open while playing YouTube videos and it handles it impressively well.  BUT I should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen, it's certainly good enough for the average person, but if you're used to good screens this may bother you a bit, but it's certainly not unbearable by anyone's standards.  If you want to game, this thing can handle League of Legends on medium-low settings, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it for gaming.

I'd much rather bite the bullet and spend a little more for a product that actually meets minimum computing expectations for 2014.  I appreciate the effort to hit affordable pricing Dell but just not worth it."}

If you want a computer that plays games or any advanced tasks like editing video, this computer is NOT for you. Now when I say don't expect to play games on it, I mean it. Pretty much every major game save for Solitare won't even play on it due to the slower processor.\n\nIts also worth noting that there no bluetooth, no mircophone jack, no ethernet, no dvd/cd drive/burner, and no usb 3.0 ports. It DOES come with two usb 2.0 ports, a hdmi port, and a webcam. The webcam is nothing special, its there if you need it. Don't expect it to take good pictures or video.\n\nThe battery is pretty soild. It lasts up to 5-6 hours with normal use. The computer itself runs very quiet and is mostly cool to the touch. The only major negative to me is Windows 8.1 (though YMMV) and the Dell crapware installed. I would strongly recommend to remove it and install Windows 7 on it with a usb drive. The performance will improve on it. Trust me."}

If you know how to tweak the thing (and there's a review on here that can walk you through it if you don't) then it is a perfectly usable daily banger. It's not going to do CAD or any heavy graphic design because it's a $250 laptop. You can't expect top end performance. However, it handles browsing and Office just fine. My daughter can play Club Penguin without a problem. That's enough, really. The finish is odd, admittedly. It picks up absolutely every possible fingerprint and anything else that may be floating around but, that's not exactly a deal breaker. If you have the means and the wherewithal, I would suggest replacing the HD (like many others have said) with an SSD and, as always, more RAM is better but, again, this thing is just fine, as is, for most daily chores."}

If you remove windows 8 you have no cd/dvd disk to reinstall it later, bummer. The trackpad is good enough but holding me back from giving 5 stars.\n\nIf you are familiar with linux and don't mind figuring out a couple of things this laptop works great. To lose windows 8 you will need to change a bios setting and have a usb cd/dvd drive. I am still had trouble installing windows 7 on it, but I did only try once. I did install ubuntu linux and it worked fine. Finally installed linux mint 17 cinnamon 64bit and when you turn off the HDMI display in settings and make a few other minor adjustments everything works great.\n\nSo for the price of an iPod touch or an Android tablet you get a laptop that can run windows or linux and act as a chromebook."}

If you go to a \"heavy\" webpage that requires a lot of processing power, it will freeze for minutes sometimes.\nIt is not good at all and I wish I could return it or better ye, never bought it at all."}

The reviews at the time in late July 2014 were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost 4 star review...The first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus. Now the graphics are not HD...and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic (medium low grade) plastic. So if you don't have kids, or not in high school or don't accidently sit on it, it should be fine.  Now the speed is disappointing. Start up is fine  maybe 20 secs at most, but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times. Even for a 4GB RAM it barely chugs with 3 tabs open. I tried all the Window updates (this worked for a couple of HP laptops I7in that I bought later at BB) to see if it could remove the drag, it did not. Really at this point I am trying to confirm if the RAM can be upgraded to see if I can do that to help. Couple that with lack of inbuilt Bluetooth, dvd drive you are looking at a close tie (or even a loss) compared with the other laptops on sale in mid to late August 2014. The HP laptops 17in (with i3 core and AMD) I mentioned before from the other big electronic BB store smoked this one even before I updated windows and upped the RAM. But alas they were gifts...and what is a gift if not given?  All in all I wish I had waited a bit. But then again hindsight is 20/20. Bought a usb dvd rW drive but have not used it yet."}

Therefore, I wanted to clarify a few things to hopefully help everyone through this process.\n\n(IMPORTANT NOTE) Do not be confused by the nomenclature for this process as it goes by many names; i.e. migrate, copy, transfer, etc. This is *NOT* my video but it is very helpful. I've also reposted the video on how to remove the Dell HD and install the SSD. Here is the link.\n\nLast note: it does not matter which SSD you purchase, it will be up to each individuals preference (i.e. price, features, etc.). So if you do buy a SSD, make sure that:\n\n1) The SSD is a 2.5\" drive, SATA III\n2) Check to see if it comes with \"cloning\" (migration, transfer...) software.\n3) If it does not, there are several other cloning software programs available online that are free to download. But I wouldn't recommend this route if this is your first drive swap.\n4) Make sure you get a USB to SATA cable. This is the one I purchased. Buy it, use it, keep it or return it after your done. Your preference but you will need this.\n  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057UAB2K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nThat's all you need folks. Then follow these two videos and you will then reap the rewards of a faster laptop and the gratification of the successful install!\n\nSo, removing the HD & installing the SSD video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up5uGX1Bf4g\n\nAnd, the video to clone the drives:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfUe81ThddM\n\nHope this helps.\n\n***UPDATE 10/26/14 - Looks like the laptop is now shipping with an i3 CPU and an upgraded GPU (on board). I'd be interested to here reviews on this.\n\nAlso, here are some pros and cons after owning the laptop for 3 months.\n\nPROS:\n-High price-value ratio, decent hardware components and performance for the price\n-Extremely light weight and very thin\n-Easy to upgrade components, you can do this rather economically to keep the overall costs down\n-Full 10 key number pad and smooth key operation\n-Webcam, and photo verification for login (some may not be aware of this but the webcam also acts as a security measure)\n-Great for medium-heavy work loads, i.e. running multiple programs, playing music or videos, etc.\n-Solid construction, mine travels with me in my backpack and it takes a beating, haven't had any issues\n\nCONS:\n-Processor could be faster, however I mention below on how to increase the CPU's performance\n-Lack of RAM. The 4GB RAM is quite slow but I describe my experience below after upgrading the RAM to 8GB\n-Hard drive has plenty of storage but it's also slow. See below for SSD upgrade and comparison\n-With the factory components, the laptop struggles with heavy flash websites. You can alleviate this issue by upgrading the hard drive and RAM\n\n***UPDATE 10/24/14 - Putting this at the top since some have asked for instructions on how to replace the hard drive and RAM. Here are two (2) youtube videos (not mine) that will walk you through the process. NOTE: Pay close attention and follow his exact removal and re-install process of the cover on the underside of the laptop, otherwise you will break the plastic tabs.\n\nHard Drive removal and installing SSD\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up5uGX1Bf4g\n\nUpgrading RAM\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24kPq-xzwHc\n\nREVIEW:\n\nGreat budget laptop, especially for students. Keep in mind the price reflects the product.\n\nBefore deciding to move on to other brands, consider that there are many consumers who purchase laptops without possessing any rudimentary knowledge about computer software and components. Let alone there are buyers who show lack of consumer aptitude by writing comments like \"thought it came with a optical drive, 1 star.\"\n\nSo, quickly I'll highlight on a few things you can do to noticeably improve the performance of this laptop.\n\n-First, replace the HDD with a SSD. You will experience an immediate performance boost. You'll need a USB to SATA cable to clone the drive. It is very, very easy and basic. Samsung offers a great software to assist you in this process. Here is the drive I purchased.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E3W15P0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nHere is the cable.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057UAB2K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\n-Second, uninstall McAfee as it ties up many of your systems resources. Microsoft Defender comes pre-loaded, just turn this on. Also, uninstall all the Microsoft apps you do not use. Most of these run in the background tying up CPU resources.\n\n-Third, unlock the CPU's parked cores as this will allow the processor to operate at it's highest output. To do this, follow these directory series. Control Panel\\System and Security\\Power Options\\Edit Plan Settings. Then go to Advanced Power Settings. A new window opens, then scroll down to Processor Power Management and click to expand. You will see Minimum Processor State, click to expand. The default setting is 5%. Increase to 100%. You will notice that the Maximum Processor State is already at 100%. Apply the changes. Now you have a processor running at it's maximum performance capacity. You should see a overall noticeable performance increase in all areas.\n\n-Fourth, make sure you have the Power Saver mode OFF. This mode tells the CPU and other components to run at a minimum state, hindering performance.\n\n-Fifth, if you are comfortable with removing programs both in the control panel and in the registry, then remove all the unnecessary Dell software. You can use CCleaner to assist you.\n\n-Sixth, using CCleaner, go to the start-up programs which run in the background. Turn off all the programs and automatic updates that you won't use.\n\n**UPDATE: As of 9/23/14, I have updated the ram to 8GB. The performance increase was significant. It still travels with me to college 4 days a week and I have no issues with it. I wanted to make this clear, the laptop is considerably lighter and thinner than most others (excluding the Chromebooks, SurfacePro's, etc.). Although it doesn't contain \"powerhouse\" components, it does a fantastic job in handling medium-heavy work loads, i.e. multiple programs open, streaming, VPN programs (LogMeIn), student learning applications, and so on.\n\nHere is the ram I installed.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Crucial-PC3-12800-204-Pin-Notebook-CT102464BF160B/dp/B006YG8X9Y/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1411501025&sr=8-3&keywords=laptop+ram\n\nAnd like the above reviewer mentioned, if you are comfortable with wiping the drive clean, do so."}

I feel as if I would be asked to leave the quiet ride car if I was using this computer on a train.\n\nAside from that, even though I've only been messing around with the laptop for about an hour, there isn't too much to complain about (although the mouse pad buttons would be a big deterrent for me if I saw this in store). The sound the mouse pad makes, for me, decreases its actual monetary value. In store, I would not have paid $250 if I knew it sounded like this.\n\nMy main reason for purchasing is the price and I desperately needed a new laptop but I didn't want to spend like $550 bucks on the laptop I wanted. However, I would have spent money elsewhere if I knew a feature on the product I bought sounded God awful.\n\nAside from that, I am pleased with the keyboard. It is the only thing that saves it. I like the number pad feature and am happy with how my fingers glissfully slide across the keys. I do NOT like how the caps key lights up but the number lock key does not. There isn't either a feature on the screen, that I can see so far, which details the number feature is engaged.\n\nI did NOT like how it started up. When I got through set up, I expected the original desktop to show. When I saw all these apps, I thought I was connected into my phone and seriously contemplated if I had bought one of those app laptops by mistake.\n\nWith all the junk on that screen, I missed the 'desktop' application.\n\nThe computer feels fairly sturdy. I like its thinness, another plus quality; although the plastic surrounding the mouse pad and the mouse pad buttons is cheap, everything else seems of quality.\n\nYou get what you pay for. It's arguably worth the money however the mouse pad is pretty atrocious. I'm surprised how cheap it really is. I purchased a mouse so I'm not going to continually be annoyed at the sound. Still, my very first laptop, in 2003, which was a Dell Inspiron, the reason for buying this one, had a better set up."}

But the biggest selling point for me was the fanless design so that noise is minimal and you can even achieve 100% silence by throwing in SSD. The lack of DVD drive was a plus for me, since it helps reducing the weight. I don't remember the last time I used an optical disk. And the lack of network cable port is not a big deal since I can't remember the last time I used it either. Performance wise this is good enough for basic office/school use, web surfing, watching movies etc.\nSo you can have a pretty solid laptop for a cheap price... that is, if you're lucky enough to get a working battery. Mine had zero charge out of the box and after plugging in for hours it's still at zero percent. Laptop shuts down immediately if I pull out the charger and only works with the charger plugged in. I don't know the battery is defective or the power circuit inside the computer.\nI would give it 5/5 if everything worked out of the box.

I had a Dell Inspiron 15iRV in my wishlist for months, and was watching the price creep down steadily before I made my purchase. Then this little guy popped up in my 'You might be interested in!' Amazon feed for about a hundred less than the one in my wishlist. And at this point, I admit that I was dumb and cheap and TOTALLY purchased the wrong laptop. I received it at home, and was delighted with the weight, keyboard, display, and speed of service. I set it up with everything, and promptly forgot the password to it. I tried calling various support departments but nobody could help me reset the password. I took it to a friend's house who is in IT professionally but because it was locked there was little he could do. This was when he pointed out, 'Hey, did you notice this doesn't seem to even have a DVD drive?' And lo and behold, I went back to check the product description and no, it did not. I decided rather than fight with it more and purchase an external drive I would exchange it for the one in my actual wish list. The Amazon return service was EXCELLENT and UPS even picked up the package from my house. The charge was deducted from my return amount but that didn't even bother me.\nI stress again that this seemed like a reliable, sturdy, and good machine for the price, but it did not seem to have an actual drive. And it DOES say this in the product description, so that was all my mistake. Nor does it have Bluetooth, either."}

This laptop is great how ever I didn't receive the dual core but instead a single core. I was refunded and thank you amazon for the quick response.\n\nThis laptop is as simple as it gets. Windows 8.1 beautiful, easy to use and apps make life easier.\nThe screen is very still and I guess Dell bust have a pretty good reason why and I think that is better so things are kept in tact. However the screen is good but could have been better, then again what we pay for is what we get. I personally think that VGA and Internet should be a standard aspect in laptops and are vital from a technician point of view.  This laptop didn't have VGA nor Ethernet and just two USB and HDMI, yes HDMI is a hundred times better than VGA but I still think sometimes a VGA is needed also an Ethernet port.\n\nOverall this laptop is performing great, its sleep light and slim. A very stiff screen and no DVD drive. For the price is a great  deal with a Dual Core processor 4GB of RAM and 500GB HDD. No other complains on this machine. So far so good."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "Windows requires you to fill in some information right off the bat before you actually use this laptop. I could not connect to my network with this laptop during the first two or three tries. That was my first warning that this laptop wasn't right.\n\nI should have guessed that something would be wrong, given that Amazon shipped the laptop along with a printer in a gigantic box that was entirely too big with two sheets of brown paper and one flimsy strip of tape along the top that was already half ripped open.\n\nI have consistently had issues with this laptop randomly dropping off the network since I finally got it connected the first time.  My iPhone has not had any issues with the network and my old laptop running Ubuntu occasionally has issues with the network. Oddly the Ubuntu laptop and this Dell laptop never fall off the network at the same time. I have a wireless router acting as a repeater about fifteen feet behind me.\n\nI called Dell and the first gentleman told me that it sounded like a hardware issue and that I should probably just ship this laptop back to Amazon. The second gentleman wanted to take over the laptop remotely and do who knows what kind of troubleshooting. He spend two minutes trying to tell me where I should go to check something, which was two minutes too much since I was already on the screen I needed to be. He just automatically assumed I was a moron. I can't say I'm impressed with Dell's customer support and ultimately that may be why I'll never buy another Dell.\n\nI have had great difficulty rousing this laptop out of \"sleep.\" The screen will flash from black to white, then back to black again when I tap different keys or the power button. Occasionally I can see the login screen, but then the screen goes back to black.\n\nWindows 8 is just as bad as everyone's told you unless you are very much connected to Microsoft's offerings like Hotmail. It has a neat look, but it's a huge change from previous Windows versions. Classic Shell does bring back that old Start button you knew and loved, so I suggest installing that along with Google Chrome and Adblock Plus as soon as you get a laptop running Windows 8. This laptop does have a matte almost black plastic case that does feel very, very cheap and shows fingerprints like crazy. It's big, it's clunky and it doesn't seem like it would take much of a beating if it accidentally slipped out of your hands. It's a cheap laptop, so you are getting what you paid for. One thing I really hate is the targeted advertising you get while using this computer. Dell and McAfee popups selling services while I try to use the laptop are very, very annoying. I understand this is a cheap laptop, and perhaps part of that reason is because McAfee paid Dell to use the latter's captive audience. It's akin to seeing ads on a website- you're there for the content, but you can't escape the intrusive, annoying ads on the page you're trying to read. This laptop was not bought so that we could be advertised to, so if this is how laptops are these days, count me out.\n\nIf an item says it has certain features, those should work. I am sending this laptop back today. I'm not happy with Amazon's shoddy shipping (no signature required to receive the package to boot!) and the potentially defective hardware on this laptop. This should work right out of the box and it doesn't. I really don't have an infinite amount of time to play around and troubleshoot this laptop's issues. Lemons happen and I know that. Maybe this laptop worked before Amazon shipped it out. If you receive this laptop and the packaging looks inadequate and/or beat up, just have UPS/Fed Ex return it back to Amazon. It's not worth your hassle."}

I'm currently adding programs that I need for school to see if I really need to return this laptop.  I really want to keep it so I'm hoping for the best.  I'll update when I find out and hopefully change this review into a positive one.\n\nI received this laptop 2 days ago and I'm shipping it back.  After reading all the reviews, I thought it would meet all my needs.  I'm not a heavy laptop user and only need a functional laptop for school.  I was going to use this laptop for lectures, taking notes, going through power point slides, and watching youtube videos.\n\nThe first sign of trouble came when I noticed there was a lag time for what I was typing and what was appearing on the screen.  For a laptop that just came right out of the box, this was a really bad sign.  Projecting a couple months when I've actually put programs onto this laptop, I can't imagine how much slower it might be.\n\nThe second sign of trouble came when I tried to load multiple pages at once.  Either this computer is not powerful enough to perform this function or I received a lemon.  If I tried to load 2 pages at once, the first page I tried to load would stop loading.\n\nThe third sign of trouble came when I tried watching a youtube video.  The video was laggy and there was this annoying buzzing sound that would come from the video's audio due to the lag.  It was like a static sound.  This was especially noticeable when I tried to look through my email as the video was running or go to a different tab.  The video would freeze up more and create more of that annoying static sound.  This was the final deal breaker for me as I need to be able to watch lectures for school while running other programs like Power Point or Microsoft Word to take notes.  If this computer can't even handle a simple youtube video while I try to check emails, I can't imagine how it would function while I have other programs running.\n\nI tried talking to dell tech support about these issues of sound quality and the slow performance but they weren't able to help.  I'm sending this laptop back now.  I'm not sure how other people gave this thing such a high review.  Either I received a lemon or other users are happy using only 1 program at a time or 1 webpage at a time for this laptop.\n\nI tried watching a hulu video today without any other programs running and even the hulu video stops every couple of seconds.  This isn't due to my wireless as my other computers don't have this issue at home.\n\nWord of Warning: I would stay clear of this laptop and spend more money to get a better product. I have to ship this back now and will probably occur a restocking fee along with a shipping fee.\n\nI am really confused how this laptop got such a high review..."}

I see other reviews freaking out because there's not disk drive. Yes, it's stated right there there is none. Read better. Anyway, this has a decent amount of RAM. Windows 8.1 isn't nearly as bad as 8, if you install Start8 you can get your start bar back too. I also make it so the desktop shows and not the weird menu that 8 and 8.1 has. The graphics card isn't too bad for it being an integrated one. I can run the Sims 3 (all expansions too) with the graphics set to the lowest quality, no lag. Minecraft runs great, and so do games like Fallout 3 and NV if you turn the graphics all the way down. Processor speed is great too. For what I do with a computer/laptop this is the best for the prices. Webcam is decent too! I actually like the missing disk drive. I haven't used CD's in years. You can always get a USB CD/DVD drive or just make a bootable flash/usb stick like I normally do."}

The price is realized since there is no optical drive, touch screen, Bluetooth or wired Ethernet, but at this price that's OK.  You can use an external drive and WiFi for your connection needs.\n\nEven with the plastic feel it's been quite durable and easy to care for with storage in a case when not in use.  I also like to use a trackball instead of mouse or touch-pad, but the touch-pad is OK if you decide not go that route.  It is a fully functional system with a bright easy to read screen, that is perfect for web browsing, checking email, watching movies download to the hard drive and has fired right up even after sitting in my hot car for most of the day.\n\nIt is a bit sluggish with high performance software and that's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Overall, a really great system and one that will serve you well.  I suggest this a starter system for middle school age children that have the discipline to care for such items but don't need the high power and extras of a more expensive system.\n\nOutstanding value!"}

I found this model and the specs seemed adequate for my needs. Unfortunately I was completely wrong. Right out of the box it was the slowest computer I've handled in what must be years! The simplest tasks, whether it be open Microsoft Word or Internet Explorer would clock at about a minute. A full minute to just open the page to make a web search is impractical. Let alone actually make the search! I was able to bring up a speed test and use another fast computer on my home wifi and the other computer blazed and the speed test said I was getting 25 Mbps so there was no problem with wifi! I'm assuming it's the super low-end processor which just can't handle today's rudimentary tasks. **Don't let the price fool you! You really get what you pay for here..and maybe even less.**\n\nI purchased from the Microsoft Online Store and I'm pleased to say the Customer Service was very kind and attentive on the phone to help me return the item.\n\nPros: The screen is huge and nice for the price point. Battery is great too.\n\nCons: Everything else. I really mean it when I say SLOW. It's sad that a new product put into consumers hands can't handle the included operating system (Windows 8.1) and if it struggles just to open the Microsoft Office Suite I don't see how this machine could be worth anyone's time, unfortunately.\n\n**Again, please don't let the low price fool you.

Yesterday it randomly started working again, today it's not.\nIf it wasn't so buggy and frustrating 40% of the time I would give it a higher rating, but I have to take those things into account."}

It was collected by my boyfriend at home. I was sceptical about buying this product because he told me it may not be a good buy. suprisenly he kept raving about how thin and light it was after he collected it for me from the shipping company. i read a reveiew that said it did not come with an HDMI port and mine actually does. Can't wait to reach home and test it out. Will provide an update when I actually use the product."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "My wife and I were looking for notebooks for our kids (9 and 11 yrs old). DELL had a sale for $200.00 for this model, and we could not pass up the opportunity. All in all, this is an excellent laptop for kids or very basic laptop for a family.\n\nPROS:\n1. CHIP: Intel Celeron (dual core). This is a latest Celeron chip (N2830, Bay Trail - M) you will have. Being a dual core can handle most of the demands easily. Because it is a Bay Trail chip, it is quiet and not heavy on your resources. It is so quiet, you hardly hear the fan at all. So for your Web browsing, emails, YouTube viewing, MS Office, some gaming, and every day chores, this is a great basic laptop.\n2. BUILD. The black matte finish is not fancy but functional. Simple but sturdy. The keyboard has no flex, and comes with chiclet keyboard that is well designed and generously spaced. The screen is bright and resolution is normal for this price range.\n3. PRICE. Price differs from store to store, but if you get it in right time, you might get it for around $200.00. Even $250 is a good price. To give you a comparison: various Chromebooks are priced in this range but with less functions and memories. Additionally, you CANNOT install any Windows programs (such as, MS Office, etc), so while Chromebooks have their proper place, for those who need basic laptop for general use, this laptop might be a better fit in this price range.\n4. OS. Windows 8.1 is far, far better than Windows 8.0. If you already have 8.0, then you should update/upgrade it to 8.1. I love using it, and my kids love the tiles. PLUS, I love 8.1's Family Safety feature. I can control how much my kids can be on the computer and what days. Additionally you can also filter what kind of web they are browsing. MS also sends you (the parent) weekly report on the kids use of the computer. Love this feature! Easy to set up and monitor.\n\nCONS:\n1. No optical Drive (DVD/CD). But nowadays, this is not really needed anymore. But for those who need it, you might have to consider other models.\n2. No Bluetooth. The box says, \"Bluetooth\" but this is misprint. This model does NOT have Bluetooth.\n3. Only 2 USB (2.0) ports. I was hoping that it had another USB port.\n\nDespite the cons, considering its price, this is an excellent entry laptop for kids and those who just want sturdy, dependable laptop for every day general use. Highly, highly recommended!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "We bought this direct from Dell for $249. It was definitely a price thing. My wife's old laptop was dying and this met her criteria: 15.6 inch screen, a ten key number pad, and nearly everything else was negotiable. It does run the Celeron, but for Netflix, Hulu, amazon, facebook it works flawlessly. The only things I would say keeping ti from a 5star are the lack of a dvd drive (my wife doesn't care, but I find it a weird thing to miss) and the mouse keys. The pad works fine for normal taps, but the keys clikc with the loudest, cheapest tone I have ever heard from a trackpad. My wife also hates it, but unless you are dragging and dropping things (like when you rearrange tiles on windows 8 or set the system up) you can easily get by with just simple left clicks using the pad itself. Really overall a solid basic computer. If you really don't do much with disks or care so much about the mouse, then I would higher recommend it. I am not a huge fan of windows 8 so far, but now it has a traditional desktop view (I believe it is really 8.1) and we use that a lot. Anyways, good luck with the choosing."}

I am very pleased with it. It is not as good as the more expensive laptops, however for the price I consider it the best buy. The windows program is the same as on the other laptop I use but it operates different from what I am used to on the Dell (maybe that's because I deleted most of those extra apps). I would buy this laptop again and I would recommend anyone looking for an affordable laptop to use for work or school to buy this one. It does what you need it to. I use it for bible study, research, writing, facebook and watching various videos."}

I contacted Dell to request a refund or a new computer.  They refused.  I requested authorization to have it serviced locally.  They refused.  The ONLY option Dell gave me was to send it in for them to make the repairs.  It took almost a month to get it back.  When I did finally get it back at the end of June it started displaying the exact same errors as before.  Dell admitted in writing that they had replaced the hard drive and the motherboard using refurbished partsin essence selling me a used computer for the price of a new one.  They are now refusing to issue me a refund stating that they already replaced the computer.  I beg of you do not buy a Dell."}

I'm definitely going to do away with Windows 8 and see if that won't help speed it up a bit.\nI click on an email and it takes a couple of seconds to open.  Makes me wonder if I opened the email correctly to begin with,  that how slow it is.  And not having a CD drive doesn't help.  You can't download anything that might help troubleshoot what might be making it so slow"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00KMRGF28", "review": "It's got the new N2830 Baytrail processor. It's cheap, it's fast enough, and most importantly (to me) it's fanless. The marketing didn't even mention this. I couldn't even find out whether it had a fan or not without reading another amazon review (thank you reviewer).\n\nThere are a couple similar windows laptops being released by competing brands also with the N2830 processor. Toshiba's version only has 2GB memory. The Asus version looks great, but it's only 3 cell instead of the 4 on this one, and it's not even out yet.\n\nAsus also has a line of chromebooks that have this exact same processor, the C200, and C300s. These are smaller and more portable, but have small hard drives and Chrome OS, which can be hard to develop on.\n\nI ran windows once, and got the licence using the magical jelly bean keyfinder, and then quickly erased it, disabled uefi and installed linux mint xfce. Everything is going good. I get around 7000 score on octane benchmark. This is a very good score for a fanless. Dell's Venue tablets score in the 4000s. Samsungs fanless chromebook 2 gets around 6000 i believe. Basically I'm not aware of any fanless computer getting comparable performance that didn't have this processor. That said, your basic intel i3 cpu with a fan will get at least double this score. So while it's good for fanless, you get at least double the performance and likely more if you have a better cpu with a fan. You will not be able to play any serious games. I couldn't even get a solid 60fps playing counter-strike 1.6. I could play super meat boy without lag at 60fps. Fez and Bastion I was getting around 30 fps on average and dipping below.\n\nIf fanless cpu's are important to you, you should note that intel is planning on releasing a cpu line named Broadwell during the winter which will also have fanless variants and should be much more powerful. So It may be better to wait for these.\n\nOne thing to note is that the design has very obviously been recycled. There's a panel over where a cd drive would have been, and there's no fan in the area that there would have been. It's as though as soon as Dell got their hands on the new Processor they just whipped this together. And that's okay. Because I care more about getting this processor faster than getting a design tailored to this laptops capabilities.\n\nKeyboard is fine. Trackpad is nice and big and not sticky. Mouse clicks are brittle but loud. Layout is a little wonky. I prefer how ASUS laysout their keys with the page up and downs going down the side.\n\nMake sure you only pay $250 for this laptop. The price is what makes this amazing. The default payment option when I bought this laptop on amazon was $300 dollars. Don't fall for it!. Better yet just buy it directly from Dell."}
