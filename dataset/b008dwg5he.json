{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "This review is not intended to be technical. I'm sure you can find technical reviews on other websites or in Youtube. I purchased the galaxy Tab 2 exactly a month ago, but ended up returning it and waited for the Note. Wasn't that a smart move. The Tab just did not have it together. The screen was not very sensitive (compared to iPad and Asus brands), it was laggy, crashed several times, and the camera was laughable at best with no auto focus. PDF annotation was simply horrible. iPad and Asus tablets did a much better job annotating PDFs with the same capacitive pen than Tab.\n\nGalaxy Note on the other hand is a solid tablet. The screen is very responsive. The S-Pen is just perfect; although, I still haven't figured out how to use the back eraser. I was afraid that resting my hand on the screen while taking notes would produce artifacts, but it did not. One thing that I hadn't tried with the Tab was the Peel Remote feature. I had a lot of fun controlling my TV and DVR with this app. It's a very interactive and fun way to watch TV. You won't go back to the DVR remote if you give this app a try. I don't know if other tablets have the remote feature, but if they don't, this feature alone is worth getting the galaxy for.\n\nThe back camera is 5MP, has a flash, and can auto focus. The Adobe Photoshop touch comes with some nice filters and many of the tools found in the actual software (Gradient, Fill & Stroke, Wrap, Camera Fill, Round corners, B&W, Color Replacement, Curves, Shadows/Highlights, Noise Reduction, etc). The S note app allows you to take notes or even write math equations. You can write down anything from simple algebra to differential equations and it will solve it by Wolfarm Mathematica in a side window! Pretty amazing. Oh yes, and the side window...is great.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with this tablet. If you are deciding between this or the Tab or any other lower priced tablet, you should seriously consider the Note. It's indeed worth the extra $100."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I've been wanting an android based tablet (my wife has an ipad but it feels too limited for my use)to use for note taking for over a year now. I've tried a couple different tablets, acer a500/asus transformer and the capacative stylus just doesn't cut it. Heard about this at the beg. of the year and decided I'd get it, after a long delay which was to better the tablet, it came in yesterday. Though I know Windows Surface is supposed to be the end of Oct. and may be a game changer I've quite enjoyed my experience with android on mobile phones. Also, the app market being established and ease of sharing everything I have between devices is seamless.\n\nI will update this review in a couple weeks, this is just an initial glance.\n\nIf you're familiar with a Honeycomb or ICS tablet then the Galaxy Note 10.1 should feel very familiar. Nothing new or exciting to write home about, TouchWiz adds a couple different bells and whistles (literally, the notification chime is a whistle which I actually like) but most of which I will not use. I'm used to stock android, Galaxy Nexus, so the extra fodder that TouchWiz provides doesn't do much for me. The 1st thing I did was delete all the pre-loaded widgets. I noticed that before I did this there was a slight delay scrolling, afterwards it seems fairly fluid. I currently only have my minimalist calendar and beautiful weathers widget loaded. I still feel that if it were vanilla ICS or Jelly Bean (eventually???) it would be lightning fast. But even still it is the most responsive android (and possibly apple) device that I've used to date.\n\nThe build quality was a little better than I expected, yes its typical Samsung plastic but it feels decently and has a good weight to it. I really like the greyish color as opposed to black and though the back panel is plastic it has a brushed metal look. The screen is bright and clear, despite everyones complaints about screen resolution, and is at least readable in direct sunlight - though not ideal. The bezel is near about the perfect size for a \"writing\" tablet if held in either portrait or landscape and the speakers give it a distinct look along with being very functional since they are forward facing. The screen is a fingerprint magnet like any other touch device, so I'll be looking at a non invasive screen protector eventually. Overal I give the build quality a 7.5 out of 10. Oh, and for those of you that care - after pulling teeth chatting with Samsung online they finally said the screen is indeed Corning Gorilla Glass, but I couldn't find anything legit online to back that statement up.\n\nI've mainly been using the S Pen and am quite impressed. I think I'll finally have a writing solution instead of pen and paper. Nothing feels like ink to paper but this is pretty darned close. And being able to write small words, like I would on a pad, is great even though its hard to read my chicken scratch! But then again my penmanship is poor an paper....not much of a difference. The S Pen is the main selling point for this tablet and I think Samsung has a winner here. I give the S Pen a 9 out of 10\n\nI think things can only improve and have a feeling we'll see an update in a couple weeks; with the hopes of Jelly Bean by the end of the year - Samsung hasn't been good at keeping update promises though. I really think that if people can get away from \"screen resolution\" this is the tablet to buy regardless if you want the S Pen. Though TouchWiz isn't as intrusive as I've seen in the past I'd still like to root this device and have stock ICS or Jelly Bean - it would no doubt blaze past Apple and anything else Android currently on the market.\n\nI know this review was a little scattered and not detailed but I wanted to give a quick glimpse of what I thought, if you have any specific questions ask below and I'll check in periodically and answer them to the best of my knowledge.\n\nUPDATE: 2/20/2013\n\nOK - I've owned this tablet for about 6 months now, its time to give this review an update. I'll try to be as short and sweet as I can, but if anyone has any questions about something I left out please comment below or message me and I'll answer to the best of my ability.\n\nI've changed my review from a 4 star to a 5 star review, and until a tablet comes on the market that I feel is better than the Note 10.1 at around the same price point it will remain a 5 star review, especially now with the 4.1.2 update.\n\nThis device is completely solid and functional. It is not like the vast majority of tablets that now flood the market and feel like an overgrown smartphone. The software is well implemented, multi-tasking is great, and the multi-view capability bring it very close to the feel of using a PC. I use it daily in the workplace and also at home, in which I now rarely even use my personal PC. The build quality is solid, I've dropped it several times and there isn't a scratch on it. (Though I do have a screen protector on it AND its in a cheap poetic case) But after using it this long and the abuse I give it daily, sometimes just throwing it in the passenger seat of my truck - I think the people who say the tablet is \"cheap\" feeling b/c of the plastic build do so unwarranted. If it were cheaply built I think mine would have already broken, the body or the internals.\n\nIt doesn't really matter if you are an Android fanboy or an iSheep, the fact remains that this is the best sub $500 tablet out there to date. It has a true filing system, is fast, has true multi-tasking, great screen, great battery life, great software and a solid build. Throw in the S Pen capabilities to those that use it and it is light-years ahead of the competition. I truly believe that anyone who wants a tablet for anything more than a facebook/email machine would be unwise to choose something else. But again.....just my opinion after using it for 6 months!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I didn't buy mine from Amazon as I couldn't find it on Amazon. I ended up going to my local BestBuy to pick it up. The reviews online were mostly okay except for The Verge which said it was sluggish and basically was down beat on it.\n\nI decided to buy it and if I didn't like it I would be returning it. I picked it up around 5:30PM on the 16th of August which is the release date. The first thing I did was get rid of all the widgets that are on the home screens. I suspect those might slow it down. I kept only one widget which is the clock / weather widget. I then downloaded all my favorite apps and began to arrange and configure it the way I wanted it.\n\nIt comes with Polaris Office, which is better than QuickOffice if you plan to create and edit word docs, Polaris is easier. To view documents and complex excel sheets I find QuickOffice often does the better job. I ed up keep both installed just in case.\n\nI installed 14 games on it. All of which perform very well. There are my favorites, like FieldRunners, and newer ones like Final Fantasy, Ski Safari, Nova 3, Osmos HD, Amazing Alex and Zynga poker that I also really like. This quad core eats through anything with ease.\n\nGot the latest Google Maps, which is so fantastic on this. You can save a Map so it's available without a data connection. Perfect for these WiFi devices. I'm a fan of the new Google Play movies, music, books and Magazines too. But if you prefer Amazon or Nook, those are available as always. It comes with the B&N Nook Reader by default.\n\nThere are Galaxy Note 10.1 specific apps like Adobe's PS Touch. I've been using Photoshop since 1996 so I am going to carefully review the built in lessons for PS Touch, a mobile version of Photoshop and see how far I can take that. If you are a subscriber to Adobe's Cloud services you're supposed to be able to edit a PSD with PS Touch, save it to the cloud, and then continue to edit it with Photoshop the desktop app.\n\nThere is also S Note. S Note and PS Touch are geared to work well with the new Samsung Galaxy S Pen. This was a primary reason for me to be interested in this particular tablet. The S Pen is so accurate that you can hand write whole sheets of handwritten text with it. I didn't try to have it translated into actual text like type written text. I just left it as my handwriting. Really like it.\n\nNow this new Note 10.1 also has a new Muli-tasking feature. I should say that it doesn't multitask any app combo you want. Just a few apps blessed by Samsung which are: The base browser, not Chrome, their video player, Polaris Office, the picture gallery and their email app, not the GMail email app. Their email app can be used with POP, IMAP and Microsoft's Exchange via the built in Active Sync. So I tend to use that email client for work email and I use GMail as my personal email client.\n\nNow, according to The Verge, multitasking was horrible. Not so fast Verge. I don't know what you guys are doing but I multitask'd just about every way you can on this and it works surprising well. I wrote notes while playing video. I played video while scrolling up and down on a web page. I copied text from an email to S Note, which both apps loaded in the side by side both on the screen simultaneously method. I had no trouble at all.\n\nI bought Autodesk's Sketchpad Pro and can draw with that just fine. I also bought Adobe Ideas, but haven't yet played with that at all. Samsung also has their own kind of store and I am going to see if they have more S Pen specific apps. Really like the S Pen a lot. It's exactly like a typical Wacom Stylus. It's sharp, not that horrible eraser head large stylus you get stuck with if you want to use a stylus on the iPad. Although the iPad has Paper by 53, which I wish I had on here.\n\nI'm really just getting started. I'll have to update this review over the weekend. Only played with this new tab for about 4 to 6 hours now.\n\nCheck out Google's Currents for news, and Pocket for saving articles for future reading. Both are great on this tablet. I think all the bases are covered with this tablet. Movies, games, magazines, office and productivity, art creation and editing. It does everything. And since it is Android, you have a real file system which makes email a breeze. Love this thing so far."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Some quick first impressions of the Note 10.1 - This tablet is what the Transformer Prime should have been. I really don't see a ton of value in the S-Pen YET, but hopefully this feature will evolve and become a key strength.\n\nGeneral touch responsiveness - GOOD - scrolling home screens is much more responsive than the Galaxy Tab 2, very close to the responsiveness of the Transformer Prime.\n\nWeb Surfing - VERY GOOD - Page loads are very fast, much faster than the Galaxy Tab 2, very similar to ipad2 speeds. Scrolling is fast.\n\nScreen - FAIRLY GOOD - Same screen as Galaxy Tab 2. Similar to ipad 2. Not as nice as the new higher resolution tablets.\n\nI/O Performance - GREAT - RL Benchmark of 21 seconds... blows the doors off of ASUS & Nexus 7.\n\nThe Pen - UNDECIDED - For taking notes with OCR the S Note app does not seem like it will be able to keep up with a keyboard and Evernote. The app still seems a bit immature, hopefully will get better over time. Included S Pen does not have the eraser side seen in some online videos.\n\nGaming - VERY GOOD - Frame rates are fantastic, touch and accelerometer responsiveness seem great. HUGE improvement over G Tab 2.\n\nCompass - Worked great. Seems very accurate.\n\nWiFi - Seems to have strong reception and fast throughput throughout the house.\n\nGPS - Strong reception, quickly got accuracy to 20 feet indoors.\n\nSound Quality - VERY GOOD - The front speakers are really nice for a tablet. You should have not issues covering the speakers with your hands.\n\nBuild Quality - GOOD - Nice fit and finish, no loose parts, no surprises. Still feels a bit plasticy, not as nice as ipad.\n\nSoftware - Everything seems to run without any hiccups, more polished and less buggy than what I've seen on Asus tablets.\n\nLet me know if there are any other aspects you'd like to get feedback on to help you make your decision on this tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I've never purchased a tablet before, but as a grad student whose office had already been scolded for using too much toner (we're all first-semester Master's students as of Fall 2016) I figured that maybe it was time to invest in a product that would allow me to annotate my PDFs digitally. While I could probably do this with my computer, it's not the most portable device and I love the note-taking features my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 phone offers with its S pen, S Note, and Write on PDF features. Because I do a lot of reading, the phone's smaller screen wasn't suitable for a lot of late-night annotating, so when I went looking for tablets (on a budget, mind you, I certainly can't afford a Microsoft Surface Pro or anything), I knew that I essentially wanted a larger version of my Galaxy Note phone, and this tablet fits the bill perfectly, as the name would imply.\n\nBecause this version of the Samsung tablets is older, I couldn't download all the apps I have on my phone, namely the Microsoft Office Suite and Write on PDF functions, but I've found ways around both these obstacles. The tablet comes with its own suite of Microsoft Office-like products which I've found are passable for looking at (if not editing) Word Documents and because I mostly use Google Docs and Google Drive for writing papers and saving documents, this aspect hasn't really been an issue for me. The inability to install the Write on PDF app was a little more tricky to resolve because I use that app a lot on my phone, but ultimately after some searching I found an app that works even better: Xodo. This app lets you open multiple PDFs at the same time and switch between them with no problem, will read you passages out loud, lets you actually rotate weirdly scanned PDFs (all of which Write on PDF doesn't let you do), and does all the other things that the Write on PDF app does, so in some ways, I'm quite happy that I couldn't download my Write on PDF app.\n\nAll in all, while the tablet has the drawback of an older OS and an inability to download more recent versions of apps, it's a wonderful and affordable device (I bought mine for less than $200) and works fantastically for a grad student looking to take handwritten notes on it and watch Netflix. I would highly recommend this tablet and its S Pen to anyone looking for a tablet for note-taking or grad school purposes and who is on a budget."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I bought one 3 and a half years ago and it is still going strong, and is still my favorite tablet.  What makes it stand out?\n\n1)  Front facing stereo speakers IN THE RIGHT LOCATION (unlike other tablets with front facing speakers).  Very good sound.\n2)  Charging ports are the weakness of Android tablets/phones.  This is by far the most rugged and reliable charging port of any Android device I've used.  3.5 years without problems.  And I've been careful, but sometimes dropped it while charging.\n3)  I'm no expert, but I believe Android 4 was the peak version.  Later versions don't really add much.  I like the look, functionality, and simplicity of Android 4 the best by far.\n4)  The price now for this tablet refurbished is a steal.  Not worth the extra price for the 2014 version in my opinion.\n5)  Display is excellent.  Great vs. viewing angle.  Brightness and color are fantastic.\n6:  Good Samsung perks.  The Samsung keyboard is the best I've ever used.  Much better at predicting my next word than basic Android tablets.\n7)  It is also reliable and rugged.  Top of the line speed in 2012, but still plenty fast today.\n\nI bought another one a few days ago.  I've gone through a few other tablets in 3 and a half years, but this is by far my favorite."}

Having had issues with losing notes in the past when I loaned them to classmates, it was a huge relief to be able to just email them to someone without having to give them up. The tablet's always been on the slow side, but it's an older model and it is refurbished so I really didn't mind much.\nIt worked great for almost six months. However, over this past weekend, I didn't have time to study and left my tablet on my desk the entire weekend. No one touched it, no one dropped it (single girl with no kids, so I know), and when I picked it up today, the colorization of the screen had gone negative and most of my programs are now illegible and unusable. I did some troubleshooting on my own to no avail (and no, negative coloration is not turned on under settings in case you're wondering), not even a hard factory reset fixed the problem.\nI contacted Square Deals and was told that because I had gone past 90 days, they couldn't do anything. Not so much as a by your leave, or we're sorry, just a quick this is no longer under warranty email and that was that.\nRudeness aside, that's all well and good, I totally understand. But I spent over 200 dollars on a product that conked out on me in less than 6 months. If that's supposed to induce me to purchase another product from this company, they can think again. Ironically enough, I was actually planning on purchasing one of these tablets for my cousin's birthday as she is starting medical school soon. Still planning on it, but I am not going to buying one from Square Deals.\nBottom line: If you want to spend money on an electronic product that won't last, go for it. Otherwise, I'd stay clear and look elsewhere. Seriously."}

Hey, I'm still in my one year parts and labor so you eat the $50 and fix the problem, meantime unfortunally google search has stopped, they won't fix this problem as well.  other problem is when the keyboard would come up it would not type in certain numbers as well as n b c or t's. first person said just reboot and wipe out everything and restore origional settings. this did little other than loose all my files and pictures.  buyer beware, this was a total waste of hard earned money."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "..unless you are OK with being stuck at Android 4.1.2.  Samsung jerks promised a 4.4 version that will be out sometime in the spring of 2012.  Hmmm  Maybe they thought the Mayans were right and figured that since the planet would be destroyed why bother?\nIf you don't mind risking a heart attack you can install 4.4.2 Gnabo ROM that you can find online.  If you have never installed a ROM onto a tablet then this will be scary.  You spend 200+ dollars on this thing so you hope you don't 'brick' it.\n\nI suspect the main reason you are even reading this is because you want to know if it is worth the extra $$ to have one with a stylus.  YES!  Once you go stylus you don't go back.  It just makes everything so much easier.  And thats why you will want to buy a Samsung Note as your next phone.  Because you just love the stylus feature and Apple doesnt have a stylus for their products.  (Get with the 21st Century Apple!)\n\nCheck out the youtube online reviews and you will pretty much know how these work. Especially that 'rootgalaxynote' guy.  Hes VERY helpful with many Samsung devices.\nI would definitely recommend the Note series.  If you are one of those people that thinks  the NSA should not be looking over your shoulder 24/7 grab a Note 4 which allows you to remove the battery.  The note 5 still has the pen but does not allow you to remove the battery. Who knows, maybe the feds ordered them to make it so you cant remove the battery.  Otherwise the Note 6 is supposed to be out soon and I'm sure will be even cooler (if you are ok with having no privacy)  :)"}

As someone who is a long time iPad user, this will my last time fooling with an android devices, especially this one. Here's why:\n1. Not as easy & intuitive to use as an ipad\n2. Big time batter drainer.\n3. Can not use an sd card, thank to the KitKat update, so you basically stuck with your device internal memory.\n4. Android updates are so slow reaching, and not every device gets the update at the same time, unlike apple OS.\n5. Far less good apps.\n6. Very hard to manipulate files and folders, need separate apps.\n7. Bulky and heavy tablet\n\nI know there are many hardcore android users out there who will not agree with me, but just take any of the above cons and try to convince someone who is new to android. Why would anyone in their right mind settle for slow-coming updates that some get and other don't? Or Why would any one to buy a device that advertise the use of an sd card when it can't be used?\n\nI can go on and on, but these are just strong reasons not to buy this particular device, as well as all Android devices for those of you who are new to android.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Pros: It's light and feels good on the hands. The stylus is great with writing with the note app. it registers well with what you want to right and gives you the best ability to zoom and save space on each page you write on. Internet browsing is just like using your computer you just need to make sure you don't use the mobile websites and your set. Drawing is fun on here you can do so much with the photoshop and filters of the device. Camera is decent and has a good light adjustment function but that is it don't expect much out of it. the auto brightness function is awesome! It registers really well with your surroundings and helps save your battery life well. The batter life is amazing and gives you alot to work with when you are taking notes in class. If You have your WIFI off at all times your battery can last about three days without having to charge it. Keep this in mind though I had brightness below 50 percent and nothing running in the back ground of the device.\n\nCONS: writing can be your worst nightmare if you don't have a cleaning cloth large enough to have your palm of your hand to rest on. I mean when I wrote in class I tend to rest my hand on the pieces of paper that I right on it just feels comfortable, but when I do that on the tablet there goes the page shrinking or enlarging as I write because I rest my hand on the screen. And you would think with a auto-locking function on the screen that keeps your hands from registering on there that it would work for you hand it sadly doesn't. The device will mistaken it for you trying to pinch the screen and trying to either enlarge the window or zoom out.\n\nVerdict: 4/5 you get your money's worth if you use it for college work and you can really benefit from it actually being a ultra book like device which is really nice because you can almost do everything a computer can if you buy a keyboard. Losing the stylus means saying good bye to good note taking in class and spending 40 to 50 dollars on those little piece of turds. Be mindful that this is not a device to spend on for fun, if you want to get some solid work done like taking notes, reading slides, writing a word document , sending emails, or anything like making a planner then this will pay off greatly for you. If you want to look at cat videos or browse the internet of stupid things go spend your money somewhere else. I have been using this device on a daily basis and keep it well protected with a case. so keep in mind that a case is a must for this thing because it feels like i could step on it and break the thing in two."}

Samsung  makes quality products....I love the SPen....which is what made me decide to take the plunge into the Note...but I was  not interested in the 2014 version...so I did my research and found a very very good deal.....was amazed how well this tablet has retained its value over 2 years!!!\n\nOnce I received it...though I do like Jelly Bean....Im one of those who likes all the new bells and whistles with software....so I decided to Root my Note and then install a custom ROM  of Kit Kat which still retains the SPen capabilities and adds to them.....with no lack of speed....and I can utilize multi windows....up to 4 at one time.......as well as have the S4 slide out list......which to me just puts my Galaxy Note 10.1 N8013 over the top!!!!!\n\nWould highly recommend this tablet to anyone looking for  a very nice and solid tablet!!!!!\n\nAs a side note...if you are needing a charger or a cable for the Note 10.1 N8013.....the Tab chargers work with them....must be a 30pin and the charger must be 2A......."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I bought this because it was supposed to be better than the Tab2, 10.1 I already had, having a quad core processor and the stylus features. It came with ice cream sandwich os, and I ignored the update alerts for jellybean for a year or so while learning the features, but after reading the reviews and forums promising a \"smoother\" experience I gave in & allowed the update, the worst computing decision I ever made, and I'm so glad the tab2 still has the original ICS os, even tho it crashes regularly online, since at least it displays pictures well. Right after the Note update it was like a strange new environment of delays, pauses, glitches & problems. The Gallery ap was unrecognizable, and took forever to load, pictures moving in a circle is not worth waiting for. The latest problem is the my 32G micro SD is now unrecognized, so all my docs & pics are gone. I had a Samsung rep look at the Note & it took him 3 hours of tapping to free up a minimal amount of memory to eliminate the ever present low memory messages. I have no confidence in this machine and there being no way to revert to something that at least worked and I found useful, I'm now stuck with the industry standard never ending push toward planned obsolescence and the auto updating software Samsung/Google dictates I must sacrifice my memory for but never use. In my case progress is in the reverse direction and with no warranty remaining I now have essentially a $500 paperweight. I never attemped to root this machine or any other geeky stuff, all I wanted was a compact device to surf & do email.\n\nWould I buy another Samsung? Take a guess..."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "This is a decent 10\" tablet. It may be outdated at this point but still holds up for entertainment, games, and web browsing. The TFT display is almost as good as IPS, as Samsung knows how to make a good display. The front facing speakers provide excellent sound. It also has an active digitizer for added productivity. I bought one used for ~$225 dollars and I have no complaints, other than I learned that 8\" tablets are probably a much better form factor. 10\" is just too big.\n\nI would only recommend buying this if you can get it used or refurbished on the cheap. It is not worth paying $400-500 for, as there are certainly more state of the art options in that price range these days. That said, it's a completely adequate and serviceable 10\" tablet with the added benefit of a cool active digitizer stylus function."}

I bought both for my sons birthdays a year ago, and ordered two 8\" tablets this year since their 10.1\" notes worked out so well. I wish I had purchased the 32gb versions is the only regret. I spend a lot of time making room for new games at times. I rooted both tabs and run CM11 Unofficial for N8013. Using Philz Touch recovery. Cyanogenmod really makes use of the 2gb of ram by freeing it up for games instead of stock background processes. At 2gb Ram, these tabs still have more than most Android devices available. A funny thing is that even one year later, $180 each is still an excellent price! Hopefully the new tabs work out as well as these two have!\n\nA very VERY nice buy on two of these tablets. $180 each... No charger or s-pen. I just bought them separately lol. Tablets were listed 'good' condition, but one should have been 'Acceptable' really IMO. The other was closer to 'Very Good' though. This is based solely on scuffs on the sides and back of the tablet. I still would have bought both though, and neither had a smudge even on the screen and both have perfect functionality. The folio case cover cover all but the screen anyway... So who cares! I should have bought the third one the seller had for a spare/backup device for my kids. These two were for my sons, ages 5 & 6. They already have Galaxy S4's and Tab 3 8.0's each and wanted a big tablet like I got their sister. I flashed CWM Recovery the CyanogenMod 11.0 with Android 4.4.3 KitKat and used Titanium Back to move a bunch of games from their phones/tablets over to these so they wouldn't need to start from the beginning. Freed up a lot of storage and put in a 128gb microsd with vfat format and a lot of games for emulators... very happy kids this morning! Thanks for the awesome deals on the tablets to the seller. Highly recommend this seller!"}

My laptop crashed and I was faced with the expense of repair and or replacement and decided that I really didn't need the power of a laptop as much as I had thought and the number of apps available today for the tablet makes it a much more viable replacement computing device.  If you couple the size and weight issues in your decision process it is hard to say that the smaller unit is not the better choice.  As it turns out, the replacement of the HD for my laptop would cost as much as the Galaxy Note and I would still go through all the pains of reloading the computer. So I decided to give the unit a try, it has been great and I was right I hardly have missed the added power the laptop provides. I have access to all my files and the ability to bring them up, print them, or use them while in a meeting.  In many ways it is much more efficient even though less powerful. I did find, after the fact, that the note 10 does not support a SIMMs card and I was required to purchase a Hotspot in order to have an assured data link but that too has not been that great of an added cost and it is convenient.  My Samsung S5 has the wifi call option and now even in poor signal areas I just use the hotspot and all is well.  I have found the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 to be very efficient and a viable workaround for a laptop.  I would recommend it to a friend."}

You can write math equations into the note app and it'll solve them, same with chemistry symbols, and the pen feature works really well. Much better than I've found in a few others I tested out."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I really love my Galaxy Note, especially the S Pen function for taking notes is cool. I also use it to read at lot on the train, both pdfs for school and books on Kindle and I'm quite satisfied with the resolution, though the screen reflects quite a lot in strong sunlight. For me the two major drawbacks are that it takes very long to recharge the battery, about the same time as getting them empty, and while charging, you cannot use it. Or if you try to use it, it doesn't charge properly. The second drawback for me is (as I only have the Wifi model, so I can only access the internet via the hotspot on my mobile) that there is no USB port for quick download/upload of data for when I do not have a fast internet connection. When I first unwrapped it I could not believe it didn't have a USB port. You can buy an additional adapter but even so sometimes it would not recognize the device when I connected a USB stick. I don't want to be nit-picky, but for me these two drawbacks really detract from the otherwise great usability of the Galaxy Note"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "By now I've been using it for about a year and I love it. I use it mostly for entertainment - to play games and to read, and it satisfies my needs perfectly. I know people complain about resolution, but I didn't notice any problems with it, maybe because I don't have anything to compare it to. But really, if you need to hold two tablets next to each other to tell the difference, how would lower resolution matter?\n\nThe only reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is that I don't like the screen capture button location right at the commonly used/touch area at the bottom of the screen. I found myself hitting it by accident more times than needed resulting in many screen pictures I don't need. Screen capture isn't a common operation and it shouldn't be at the place where it could be easily touched by accident."}

As a result I would not reccomend Samsung products nor will I be purchasing any in the future."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I decided to give the opportunity to samsung instead of apple, and the truth is that I have not disappointed. What is certain is that for the ipad, there is a greater variety of applications for both writing and drawing, and taking notes. But I buy this tablet basically for the application of SNOTE. And well, after trying several apps, I must say that best for writing are: Quill, Write and Papyrus. (Write and Papyrus are free apps).\n\nHowever, for ipad , there are better apps for drawing in general. In my case, I stick with LayerPaintHD, and Sketchbook, that both works with layers, \"most important function\", if you are an artist or are looking for a tablet to draw. Well, if that's the case, I must say that this tablet, works great for painting and sketching, is excellent in these two applications. The sensitivity of the pencil in Sketchbook is instantaneous , almost like a normal tablet PC. In other applications, there is a delay too minimal to perceive during writing. For Quill, there is no delay in writing, the response is immediate. Quill is just like inking in OneNote, almost the same feeling. In the case of Snote, there is a minimum delay, but does not affect the sensitivity of the writing; feels quite natural and fluid stroke.\n\nI use Snote just for everything, but for the most, for sketch; It feels like a real writing paper. Also, you can change the background of the paper, for grid paper, school notebook paper etc.\n\nIn general, the tablet is fast. Navigation on internet is fast. Videos on youtube are just in amazing HD. The battery life is long if you adjust (power save on) and disables screen rotation, vibration, gps, bluetooth and wifi. Screen colors feels vivid and beautiful. You can change the screen mood to: dynamic, standard and movie. Also, you can change the screen to negative colors which i like a lot by the way.\n\nThe only thing I consider negative, it's the size and shape of the pen. If you're an artist, you will notice this, and later you will want to buy another larger stylus. The size of the spen it's about 4.6 inches, in comparison of a regular wacom tablet pen, of 6 inches. For me, the size is too short for my big hand, and sometimes, at several minutes of drawing, it may feels unconfortable, but it's not a big deal, it's just because i'm a maniac in this type of stuff. Also, the shape of the pen (isn't round) like the regular pens, it's an square shape.\n\nFinally, i recommend this tablet for any artist or hobbyist, that looks for a drawing tablet, or for school stuff, mathematics, just for everything you can imagine. This is the best tablet at these days. :D!!!"}

It comes with a pen, and it works pretty well.  A month in, it keeps crashing.  I would get error messages almost everytime I would be using an app.  I looked up how I could fix that.  And when I thought I had fixed it, a few days later, it was back to square one.  It's one thing to crash, and another thing to crash ALL THE TIME and preventing you from using other apps and having a good experience.\n\nSave your money.  Stick to the phones.  Much better."}

It came with a case that didn't really seem to fit properly so some cutting happened. Other than that the keyboard, mouse, and traveling case were great, works without flaws.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I am writing this review using the handwriting recognition tool. I like the fact that this tablet can convert My chicken scratch into text as quickly as I can write it down. I've had this tablet for 2 months so I've had plenty of time to explore it inside out.\n\nI've read other reviews that complained about the screen resolution. I'm a graphic artist and it is perfect for me. I've played with the updated 2014 version and while the display is brighter, and the interface is almost identical to the Note 3 (which I also own), this version is still a solid tablet, especially with the new lower price tag. So if you want to save a couple hundred dollars I would not count this tablet out.\n\nThe S pen is VERY Useful to me. It feels comfortable in my hand and is very responsive. I prefer its position at the bottom of the tablet to the upper right corner where the 2014 version has placed it. The s pen interface for this tablet is like the one Used in the Note 2. So if you own or have owned that phone, it will be very familiar to you.\n\nThe multi screen feature is ok, but I do prefer the 2014's updates which allows more programs. I have had several windows open at one time and noticed no visible lag. You can also resize the windows and move them around.\n\nTouch Wiz is on top of Android and Works Seamlessly with it. I love that you can fully customize this device and truly make it your own.\n\nThis tablet is geared toward people who want to do more with their device than browse the internet and Stream movies. while I would not call this a Computer replacement, it has made my job easier with Polaris Office and PhotoShop preinstalled. It comes with 16 Gb of native storage, but Can be expanded by 64GB with a micro Sd card.\n\nOne thing that I love about Android devices is you're not stuck with one music or movie player. I have several movies in .avi format and have found an app that plays them perfectly and with the big screen and front facing Speakers with great Sound, it's just a great experience.\n\nBottom line, I give this a glowing review. I have a Samsung Laptop, Note 3, and now the note 10.1. Iexen have a Samsung refrigerator. I'm not a brand loyalist, they just happen to make devices that cater to my needs and are reliable.\n\nOne thing I do hate to read about in these Reviews is when they compare this tablet to the iPad. They pander to two different audiences."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I got the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 a couple months ago for my girlfriend for Christmas 2013. About a month ago it basically started having seizures. The touchscreen keyboard goes nuts with ghost typing; it opens and closes programs, goes from one page to the other, and has acutally changed settings as well. It gets even WORSE when the tablet pen is pulled out, all of a sudden if freezes and then freaks out even more. It doesn't stop even long enough for me to hold down the power key and turn the device off completely.\nI have researched everything, and can not find anything on why it is doing this, or how to fix it! My girlfriend has taken video footage with her phone (an Apple phone, that she has never had a problem with she says) of this device freaking out for minutes on end. It has been doing this off and on for a month/month and half.\nI researched this tablet vs. the iPad for months, and this tablet came out on top! I am really upset at the lemon that I got. We can't do anything on it, we can't even get to the home screen without it going nuts. I rated it 3 stars, because I am sure it's an ok product, but the one we got is a HUGE disappointment, especially coming from Samsung!!!\nI have already emailed the company that I bought it from, hopefully they step up and help me out, because a lot of money was paid for a dud product!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Background on how I utilize this tablet:\nI am a student and utilize this mainly for school work. So I utilize this tablet as a textbook (digital copies), powerpoint reader, checking email, note taking, and very simple web browsing. I do also use it to view videos and movies from time to time.\n\nFor those who are not very tech savy, I warn that these tablets are not to be compared to a laptop as they do not have the same processing power or abilities that laptops have and the same way you cannot compare a laptop to the same standards of that of a desktop.\n\nBattery Power: 5/5\nWhen I first purchased this tablet and plugged it in, the battery charging indicator confused me. When charging the battery will show a red X that appears on battery icon on the lower right hand corner. I use this tablet about 5-6 hours a day and I can usually go about 2-3 days without having to charge it. I had this tablet on standby mode, (the tablet is on, but the screen is off) and battery life lasted about 5-6 days.\n\nSpeakers: 5/5\nRemember these are TABLET speakers they are not meant nor are they built to be able to project 7.1 dolby surround sound. Do NOT have extreme or ridiculous expectations from these speakers. However I give them 5/5 because they do project and the volume does go much higher then I suspected and are well designed for a tablet and it's intended purpose as a secondary media device.\n\nSoftware: 3/5\nThis is where I have to unfortunately drop some points, while Samsung did an extremely good job on the overall software there are some simple things that I do not approve of in regards to the software.\n\nMy main complaints are:\n- There is no sensitivity control for the S Pen. While the S Pen works well for me on S Note and whatever else, there is not way to actually control the sensitivity of what gets recorded, so often I run into the trouble of the S Pen recording marks that I do not intend especially when I am lifting the pen up.\n- There is no way to register personal penmanship characters, I write my 0's and 1's much differently then most people and I'm sure others have their own little penmanship quirks too. For a tablet that raves about penmanship recognition, Samsung should have implemented a way for the tablet to recognize individual handwriting and allow customization for each individual user's penmanship styles.\n- Inability to delete default apps. It is extremely annoying to me that it is not just only with this tablet but with most modern electronic devices that we purchase that all these ridiculous apps that I will never ever utilize have to take up memory space and I am not able to delete them.\n- S Note, I place my S Note complaint with software because it is part of the software that interested me to buy this product. S Note should have a continuous scroll for note taking rather then having to repeatedly having to recreate a new page once I am done with the previous.\n- Another S Note complaint is the inability to have the zoom option off, I often accidentally zoom in when I am utilizing this app and it is a pretty big annoyance.\n\nWhat Samsung got right for the software:\n- Pages, widgets, and apps are easy to create, move, and organize\n- S Pen removal pop up menu, although I wish that this was more customizable and not just the built in apps it does come handy.\n- Taskbar: The taskbar allows the user to maximize the functionality and usability of this tablet. The return icon allows users to quickly go back or undo previous actions, the homepage allows for quick access your main page of apps, and the task manager allows you to remove apps that are not being used quickly as well as allowing you to switch back and forth between apps. In addition the taskbar allows you to pin apps much like on a computer running windows OS yet neatly keeps them tucked away so that they don't interfere unless you actually need to open them. Quick setting options and full setting options are available to the bottom right of the tablet.\n\nScreen: 5/5\nIf you want to view something in extreme detail go use a good TV screen or a good computer screen. I have no complaints here, 480p looks great on here and HD 720p and 1080p of course looks better. The screen size is prefect for reading digital text books for me. Although the screen is a little bright for the lowest setting for me, it's not too much of a big deal to cause a problem.\n\nMemory:  5/5\n16GB is quite enough for myself, if I need to increase memory size I can always get more by getting a microSD card.\n\nOverall Performance: 5/5\nThere are no performance issues with this tablet. Apps run quickly and load quickly.\n\nI would/do recommend this tablet for anyone. This is a great purchase for students."}

There's a way to print via cloud but why make it so difficult  (I tried cloud printing BTW but what I have tried has not worked)?  I happen to hate farmville but, she plays it and you can't do (there is only a framville light app) what you can do with a pc based tablet.\n\nSo, I bit the bullet, bought the wife another laptop and gave this tablet to my 7 yr old son for his IXL (internet math and language art learning) excersizes.  Unfortunately it doesn't easily do all of functions of that website either.  It's asking I download Adobe flash player.  Which the Adobe website says is not supported by the Galaxy note.  I think this is the same issue that is causing farmville not to have full functionality.  Printing and Adobe flash player are basic functions!!!  This purchase was a mistake :("}

All because someone at Samsung figured it'd be a smart idea to place a task bar where most people rest their hands when writing.\n\n3) While using ANY app whatsoever, the tablet will periodically go into sleep mode and you have to unlock it again to wake it. This isn't caused by inactivity and appears to be a bug.\n\n4) While my tablet connects to wifi just fine when using Samsungs built in Web browser, NO other app can get a network connection. Dropbox,Play Store,Maps,Kindle,etc... Not app OTHER THAN Samsung's web browser gets connection, not even Samsungs own built in app store.\n\nNow since I managed to make it over 2 months with this, I can't return it to Amazon and have to return it to Samsung, which is probably going to result in them spending hours troubleshooting before they give me my refund.\n\nI relied on this tablet to take most of my notes for work and class since I've had it, so now I need to worry about transferring all of my docs and notes over somewhere else temporarily while this gets sorted out...And this will probably take awhile.."}

I left it charging overnight and the next day there was a message saying the battery was critically low. In other words, no matter how I try to charge the tablet, either through wall outlet or computer, it simply won't charge. It stays at 3% and won't let me do anything, even when I have it plugged in. I tried resetting it to factory, but that didn't work. I don't know if this is a common problem or not, but I can't recommend this product if this happens after just 2 months of light use."}

The Note had good reviews and I liked the fact that it had the stylus so I decided to take a chance on it. BEST DECISION EVER! This tablet is very powerful. I hardly ever use my laptop anymore. I can do everything on the Note. It's great for taking notes, watching Netflix, browsing the web, etc. Streaming Netflix was impossible from my last device and with this one it's no problem. I also have to read a lot of papers for school and it's easy for me to download the PDF and write my notes directly on the PDF and save them, allowing me to skip printing all together. It's fast and the battery life so far is great. I highly recommend this tablet."}

Great to take when traveling or finishing up a few quick things before bed!\n\nDownsides:\n- PS Touch is... weird? When I use the S-Pen on PS Touch my lines come out weirdly pixellated. I don't have this problem on any of the other art apps I installed. Sticking to Sketchbook, I think.\n- I can't copy large chunks of text from Polaris to other word processors, which is irritating when I'm writing.\n- The autocorrect doesn't... well, autocorrect.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I bought this on Black Friday for the upcoming semester because I wanted to try taking notes differently rather than using paper. So far it's been pretty reliable, I take my notes in class, upload it to Google Drive, and access the notes through any computer with internet access. The S-Pen is amazing, it not too hard to write with and my handwriting looks pretty much the same compared to my normal writing, although as expected it is a little worse. The battery life is pretty good, I am able to last a school day which is around 8 hours taking notes (I don't use the tablet the whole day). The apps are fine because it has Google Play, and I don't really play games on this so i wouldn't know if it lags. I will list some of my favorite pros and some of the things i do not like:\n\nPros:\n- Can Open two apps at once. THIS is extremely useful for students who want to take notes and access the calculator or Internet, or even the everyday person who wants to multitask. I think the iPad doesn't do this so it is at a huge disadvantage.\n- Google Play Store\n-S-pen. I see other college students type their notes on the iPad, which to me looks time-consuming and it's harder to draw pictures or formulas or write something that would be difficult with a keyboard.\n-Lightweight. It's 10 inches but it is still easy to carry.\n-Ability to upload notes to Google Drive. I love this because Google is so convenient and I can access my notes and print it out through a school printer.\n\nCons:\n-I wish I could write on pdf's or word documents. Maybe there is a way, but I didn't find out yet. SEE BELOW.\n-The screen froze on me once already. Hopefully it doesn't happen again but it's less than 4 months and it doesn't look good if that happens, especially when I need it during class.\n\nEDIT: I found that you can download PDF's and import them into S-Note, which is very useful because you can just write on the professor's PDF's, Word Docs or Powerpoints without making a seperate note. I really like that feature. Also another thing I did not mention is that when you write on the bottom of the screen, you are prone to touching the settings option by accident which happened to me numerous times. I'm not sure how to fix it but it get's annoying."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I was looking for a tablet to use for college as several of my classes either required or highly recommended a tablet over a laptop for note taking during clinical. My first thought was, as it is for most people, to look into the iPad. Since I have a galaxy phone, I figured it would probably be easier to stick with the same OS so as not to have to buy new apps and start all over. I was glad I did because I came across the Galaxy Note and couldn't be happier with it.\n\nWhy I love it:\n\n-The price: I got it during a lightning deal and paid WAY less than I thought I would for a tablet of this size and specs. As any college student will tell you, saving money wherever you can is a huge plus\n\n-The size: I love the 10.1\" display, the resolution is great and while it may not be quite as nice as the iPad Retina display, it looks great for movies, games, and of course school work. The tablet itself is pretty thin and easy to hold for extended use.\n\n-S Pen: My main use for this tablet is for taking notes and studying, and the S Pen makes this tablet perfect for that. Normal tablets use stylus that make your handwriting illegible because of the big eraser like tip, but the S Pen allows for fine, pressure sensitive writing that looks and feels just like writing on paper. It also works great for drawing/photo editing if you're into that.\n\n-Front Facing Speakers- Im not sure why, but a lot of tablet manufacturers **cough cough-Apple-cough cough** have really neglected peoples desire for front facing speakers. To me it just makes sense that when ever you listen to music or watch videos your looking at the screen so dual front facing speakers like the Galaxy Note's just seem to make sense.\n\n-The OS/Apps: Coming from a Galaxy phone I like the set up, but I also want to give a shout out to two included free apps, S Note and Photoshop Touch. S Note is great for taking notes and comes with tons of great features (really good for students) and Photoshop is a whole lot of fun to play around with, even is you have no experience with PS. Google Play has tons of apps to download or sideload so you'll be set with tons of options\n\nThe One (and only) Thing I Do Not like about it:\n\n-The charging cord: This version of the Note uses a proprietary  charging/data cord (included), but it would be nice if it used the standard micro usb as the galaxy phones and many other smart phones. On that note, I believe the 2014 version uses the micro usb cord.\n\nBottom word: Get this tablet! I use it everyday and have never regretted purchasing it. Its a great tablet for the price, a lot of fun, and great for school work, business use or just for fun. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have."}

I would not, however, pay $400 for it (I bought it on a lightning deal for around $340) for a few reasons.\n\nNo home button - I didn't think this would bother me. Turns out, it does, and I'm glad it's something they included with the 2014 edition. If the screen goes dead, you have to press the power button, and since I have a lock on my tablet, I have to go through that again. If an app freezes (which happens occasionally, but not often) you have to use the power button instead of having a button to return you to the home screen. This is my biggest issue with this tablet.\n\nS-Pen is lacking a feature I would have liked, which would be to turn off sensing my fingers/hands/skin. I bought this tablet for note taking and drawing, but it's almost a chore because the screen constantly skips around when I try to use the S-Pen with it because my hand or wrist rests on the tablet as well. It's annoying. I know some app's allow you to turn off the sensitivity, but I shouldn't have to pay $4.99 for something to do what my tablet should.\n\nNo swype. I know, I know. It's a tablet. But sometimes I just want to use swype when holding the tablet vertically. Swype isn't installed, and you have to buy the app. Doesn't work for me.\n\nThose are pretty much my only flaws.

Iv'e used an ipad in my job, and I much prefer the Note.  I also coach, and I use the video camera all the time to show athlete performance, keep record of attendance, use You Tube to show how to videos, communicate with parents.  At church, I use Planning Center Online and Music Stand - no more paper waste for music! The bible app is such a blessing!  I read books and watch videos, use for recipes. I always have my hands on it!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Since I've purchased this tablet I can't put it down.  I wear glasses so its the right size for me, yet its small enough to fit in my tote.  The S Note feature is definitely a plus and comes in handy at meetings and church for note taking.  There are so many apps that come with this tablet, too many to mention.  The battery lasts for the period stated, even with high usage. The tablet itself is sturdy, with great resolution.  The only reason I have this four stars was that the camera sometimes does not focus well if you are taking a photo of a room.  For photos of people (smile shot) it does a great job.\n\nThis has almost replaced my cell phone since I use apps for phone calls and messaging.  I even get clearer reception than my home phone when making long distance calls to US and Canada.  Because of the many features it has also almost replaced my digital camera. This is one of the best online purchases I have made and absolutely love it."}

This holiday season I decided I'd waited long enough but instead of an ipad I decided on galaxy note 10.1 16g, in large part because I now own a Samsung phone and decided to keep it all \"in the family.\" I decided on last year's model because I having never had a table I figured I wouldn't know what I was missing by the new 2013 model. I love my new tablet. I haven't yet tapped into all it can do but I am having fun exploring it and learning. One of the options I like about it is the handwriting ability and I plan to see how well it works for note taking in meetings once this new year begins. I find this table to be responsive and I'm glad I made the choice to purchase it. A note about purchase price - I still couldn't justify to myself spending $500 (for this model 16gb) for a new one so I took the leap to purchased a refurbished tablet and found one with a fantastic price.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I am currently a college student and have been looking for the perfect note taking tablet. I am currently very happy with my choice. The s note taking app is perfect because it allows me to handwrite, type my notes or even use it's handwriting recognition feature to jot down notes. Adding pictures to the notes is as simple as pushing an icon button in the top right hand corner. The s pen is comfortable and is obviously an extension of the tablet. The galaxy knows when the s pen leaves the tablet, giving you a notification and opening up a side bar full of apps they utilize the pen for quick note taking. It even knows when the pen is hovering over the screen. A tiny dot appears when hovering and when placed on top of icons, will give a description of the icons function. This little dot is also great for editing messages due to its precision. This tablet runs very smoothly and has access to the full droid app store.

Im pleased with it for the most part but there are things that really irritate me about this tablet. Here they are:\n\n1. The microphone for the tablet is located at the bottom where the charging port is. Very annoying. When I skype with friends and family they tell me that my voice sounds \"muffled\". The only way they can hear me clearly is if I hold the tablet, which brings me to my next problem.\n\n2. I bought a little case for the tablet which props it up so I don't have to hold it. I really love the case but when the tablet sits up right the microphone is covered. When it lays flat no one can see me. When I turn it sideways so it is in portrait mode the person in which I am skyping cuts in half. I don't know if that is a tablet thing or a skype app thing but the tablet doesnt adjust to the change. When it is upside down (camera at the bottom, microphone at the top) it works but then whoever im skyping with is practically looking up my nose. I don't like it.\n\n3. The battery runs down even when Im not using it. When I had my ipad I could turn it off and leave it for a couple of days and the battery would barely go down. This tablet acts more like a computer (I have to shut it down every night or when I'm not using it)\n\n4. The tablet comes preloaded with roughly 1GB of apps I DONT WANT!! There is no way to delete them unless you \"root\" your tablet (I looked on YouTube for how to do it and it's a process. Not to mention the damage that could be caused if a mistake is made)\n\n5. I specifically wanted this tablet because I thought it would be very useful for school (I'm a junior in college). I really like taking notes my tablet but I'm irritated by the lack of printing options. There aren't any! When I tried to print my boarding pass it gave me an error saying \"Can only print using a Samsung Printer\". Seriously??? This tablet brand new costs almost as much as a new ipad and I'm restricted to only using a Samsung printer? I'm very unhappy about that.\n\n6. When watching a review about the tablet I saw that you can hand gesture and the keyboard splits in half. I can't get mine to do it. I have tried over and over. It just doesn't work for me.\n\nIn the long run I like the tablet. I'm not a very picky person and I can look past these defects since it was a gift. I would have definitely given it 5 stars if it weren't for those tablet manufacturing errors. I personally wouldnt drop $400+ of my own money on it but since it was a gift Im okay with it."}

The primary uses for me are keeping a hand-written journal and use as a portable art pad, so having a wacom pen, the same technology I use at my desktop for professional graphics work, was a must. Then Wacom came out with their own pen for the Galaxy Note, the Bamboo Feel. It's full size, more responsive, looks and feels great in the hand, and I use it most of the time.\n\nI started the journal using Samsung's S-note app but had problems saving files--some files disappeared for reasons I still have not discovered, and I lost about six weeks of journal, hence the half star deduction from the rating. I solved that issue by exporting every day's entries to Dropbox as both .snb and PDF files. Eventually, I switched to using Papyrus, a vector based app that allows for a thinner pen line than S-note's thinnest .5mm. Papyrus also allows export to PDF, but because it's vector-based, it's a cleaner file that prints more crisply than S-note's jpg PDF export. I can also open a Papyrus PDF page in Adobe Illustrator on my desktop for further modification of the vectors beyond what can be done in Papyrus.\n\nFor artwork I like the Sketchbook Pro app best. It has an abundance of brushes and allows layers. It also can export a PSD file that keeps the layers intact so further work can be done in PhotoShop or Painter on my desktop.\n\nAt first I was concerned about the screen resolution, but it's very sharp and bright and has not been an issue. It's good to see that the new model has doubled the resolution, but this will do fine for a few years before upgrading.\n\nAll in all, I'm very pleased with this tablet. If your needs are similar to mine, I'm sure you will be too."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Let's get the cons out of the way b/c I'm sure that's #1 priority\n\nCons\n\n1) Icon text and system text are not clear. Also small text looks like they suffer massive pixel shortage (which is not true).\n\nBUT texts are incredibly clear and legible when reading books or watching caption on video, or viewing normal/large/larger text on the website. If you compare those activities with one of those $500 tablets like Ipad Air, Note 2014 or Lumia 2025, they all look the same.\n\n2) Awkward positions for control buttons.\n\nFor example, if you use a tablet case and lay your tablet horizontally, the volume, headphone input, and power buttons will be on the bottom. In other words, you can't use your headphone (unless u flip it the other way), adjust your volume, or turn off/on the screen unless you have to lift up your tablet.\n\n3) Proprietary charging/data sync cable. It is not the standard USB micro. It is the Samsung 30 pin or something cable.\n\nPros\n\n1) Battery life is longer than the Note 8. I was able to watch movies for more than 4 hours straight.\n\n2) Not heavy at all considering it weighs 650 grams.\n\n3) Responsive and fast for an old processor. I did not notice any lag when switching between apps or playing game, movies.\n\n4) S-Pen is great (don't use the S-pen apps, they are ineffective and inefficient at best). You have to buy the 8 PI S pen to truly appreciate the accuracy of the pen though. The included S-pen is only 6 pi.\n\n5) No real buttons. You navigate the tablet using the on-screen buttons. This is incredibly helpful when using with the S-pen and everything else. It really helps you when you are holding the tablet too.\n\nConclusion\n\n- I feel that this tablet has so much potential if it wasn't for Samsung failed on the S-pen app and the awkward positions of the volume, power, microphone input buttons. In addition, for some reason the text clarity of the system icon and small texts are garbled. This does not make a good impression on first time buyer especially when they they think a tablet is an Ipad."}

My only complaints are that 1) there is no USB drive (but of course it's too thin to have one) and 2) it can only print to Samsung printers. Thankfully there are ways to get around both of these: 1) You can purchase an adapter (like the OEM Samsung 30-Pin to USB Adapter for Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 / 10.v / 8.9) which will allow you to use USB-powered devices and 2) The Samsung people told me that you can download apps in the Play Store for your printer. I have downloaded an HP app but haven't had a chance to use it yet. Will update this review once I do."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I upgraded to the note 2 10.1 from the tab 2 10.1 as my previous tablet was damaged beyond repair. The old tablet had its issues with freezing up after the last update along with not enough ram. The note 2 10.1 has twice the ram as the tab model. The continual problems I have had with the note is that the left side of the touch screen lacks sensitivity when using the virtual keyboard. This is a pain when your typing and find out autocorrect won't predict words correctly because it didn't sense you touching the letter selected.\n\nMoving on to the S pen. The sensitivity of the pen continually changes. Some of the time it will select the link you are trying to open in a web browser and the other times it will select another link close to the tip because it's not tracking correctly. I have changed tips from the rubber tip to the hard nylon type tip due to the rubber tip wearing out. There are articles online about adjusting the sensitivity but evidently I have the only pen that doesn't respond to adjustments.\n\nSamsung hasn't been interested in providing solutions to screen sensitivity along with the pen issues. They said to return it back to sam's club, sam's club says to contact Samsung instead. The finger pointing isn't doing anything to fix the problem so my solution is to use it as a second paperweight and go buy a different brand tablet. I like Samsung and their features offered but customer service needs improvement if they plan to keep customers.\n\nAnyone have suggestions for a mid level Ipad that would function for work and personal use? I use my current note 2 10.1 for work and personal use daily. I need reliability and function. I know little about Apple products. Suggestions welcome."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Warning... Samsung tablets and phones do not allow you to store apps in the SD memory. I did not know this and now it has become a real problem. I bought this 16G tablet and installed a 16G SD card.  The internal memory is now almost full but my SD is still nearly empty because Samsung will not allow any apps to move to the SD card.  All you can put there are pictures, music, etc.  I have a cheap 7\" non Samsung tablet and I can move apps as I want.  The Android system permits it.  To tell the truth, I bought this tablet over an Apple because I did not want the rigid control Apple imposes on users.  Now I find out too late that Samsung is worse.  Samsung told me that the reason they want apps on the main memory is for speed of access.  It seems reasonable that it is the user who should determine if speed or memory space is more important.  Samsung's answer to my complaint was to tell me to delete some apps."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I had done a fair amount of research before actually buying this little device. I wanted something that really catered to artist, but didn't have the insane price tag that most tablets that I seen artists buying (Like PC tablets and so on). So, with that being said, the price for what you're able to get is great. The pen has a huge amount of sensitivity to it, allowing for some great lines, from light and sketchy to thick and bold without much effort. Of course, a lot of it depends on the actual program you use that utilizes what the Note is capable of.\n\nThat being said, there's not a TON of options for programs. I really wish there was something that was comparable to Photoshop, but of course, given that this is not a PC tablet, I shouldn't expect it to be able to run something that powerful. But, I've manage to find 3-4 programs that work pretty well for painting and sketching, so I can't ask for much more.\n\nEverything else? It's a tablet. I haven't had any real issues with any of the other functions. The side to side window is great for using references when drawing, but that's all I can really note.\n\nAll in all, I'm very happy with the purchase."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Although it is lighter than a laptop computer, and wakes up faster, it is slower to enter data and it lacks a USB port for a thumb/flash drive. My touch typing skills are useless without a keyboard - two-finger typing is slow as is the handwriting and recognition process. The screen seems very vulnerable to scratches without getting a third-party cover. It should have come with at least a basic sleeve to protect it. Clicking on a video file on my home \"cloud\" server will download the file, after which I can play it, but my android phone streams and plays it as it is downloading. The remote control function for a television is clever, however the software wants to upgrade to a version that includes control of my camera, which is an unacceptable privacy risk. Why would it need the camera? It should also come with an adjustable stand - it is inconvenient that it just lies flat on the table. The proprietary power plug does not conform with the USB standard that most phones now use- what was the justification for that? LIke I really needed another charger to keep track of. I love my Samsung printer, but this tablet is nothing I'd recommend."}

I like having the micro SD, but so far I haven't needed it.  However, I do not keep a lot of photos or music on board.\n\nThe touch keyboard works well, and has a selectable suggested words area rather than just changing your message directly which I like as well.\n\nAs for Android - this is pretty complete, but will never be \"done\" without a version of flash player.  So many videos use flash player, that it is really crippled without it."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I really wanted to like the Note - and don't get me wrong, it is a beautiful device, feels great to the touch and does anything your smartphone does on a bigger screen and a little bit more. It's easy to be swayed by the Note, but other than showing off and being happy about its entertainment value and beauty, it's a bit unnerving. Having to learn all its quirks and options (especially with the stylus) requires a long and steep learning curve, there are absolutely no instructions, so prepare for having to google for just about anything a bit more sophisticated you want to do. I had intended to use the Note for my office, to show movie clips to clients and to type notes. That's when things got complicated. While the calendar syncs with my Galaxy S3, Notes do not. And the pre-installed office app does not print to my Epson Workforce printer (it insists it can only print to a Samsung printer), requiring awkward work-arounds that got me really irritated. So, after I bought a 64 gig sd card and a Logitech bluetooth keyboard and a cover for the whole thing (we are now at almost $700), I suddenly realized that this is a lot of money for checking emails, watching Netflix and browsing the Internet. I returned the Note and all its accessories - for that kind of money, it needs to do more: offer a keyboard, a cover or sleeve, and allow to print to any printer (I believe since addressed with Android Kitkat). If you have money to spend and want a great looking toy with a brilliant screen and value entertainment over productivity, I say go for it. All others are better off with something else.\nPROS: Beautiful, brilliant screen, great sound, lots of features, long battery life, plain fun to use\nCONS: Hampered productivity, questionable usefulness of stylus, no instructions or manual, very expensive\nRECOMMEND: For entertainment purposes absolutely, anything else is a more of an expensive joke really."}

It can effectively take the plan of all the paper I forget to organize. the device is fast and it takes the place of most things I would do with an un plugged notebook.\n\nThat being said 4 stars means there is definite room for refinement.\n\nS-Pen\n*It fits in The device and its convenient. There are some uses for The button but not many. The scrapbooking app on the 2014 model should provide more functionality.\n* The S-Pen \"keyboard\" is an option of the standard (and capable) Samsung keyboard. The downfall d- This strategy is it you choose to use a different QWERTY keyboard such as Minuum. Then Handwriting entry is far away.\n* Speaking of Minuum, it has a feature that the Samsung script \"Keyboard\" could emulate. If you tap on any text, Minuum provides the same alternate words as when you typed. This is a very convenient editing feature given imperfect handwriting.\n\nS-NOTE\nThis app has VERY promising features in terms of handwriting recognition and more specifically its ability to recognize handwritten math and recognize standard Euclidian shapes. Having said that its abilities for post-processing are lacking.\n* far times when recording sheer speed of is necessary it would be nice for S-Note to record vectors and allow the user to go back later and do text recognition.\n* Integration of text and graphics is less than perfect. If I was using MS-Word I can specify graphics to be in line with text so subsequent edits would not \"reposition\" the relative position of text and graphics.\n* It's surprising that the Signature app for taking notes does not seem to take advantage of different pressure levels. Instead I have to thread through a popup menu to adjust par width and opacity. For that matter a menu be would be far more convenient with color choice as well.\n* Export formats are sorely limited. Handwritten or type written that is recognize cannot be exported to ubiquitous docx format. This is unforgiveable. I have taken many Notes using S-Nole and when I want to categorize some scripting I was left with two horrible choices: cut & paste or export to Graphical PDF. ... lame... And that cost the 10.1 1 star.\n* If Samsung would write drivers to make a note 10.1 work just like a Bamboo stylus tablet That would doubly justify the added cost of the Note. As of this writing someone has done just that ... for Linux. Stock capability would be nice for Windows and Mac.\n* The page Size and amount of text you can fit is fairly small. Templates with smaller or 2 to 1 ledger lines would be nice.\n* Finally S-Note would do well to take some organizational and input flow Cues from MS One note. Had windows mobile had any Significant app support I probably would have went in that direction despite owning a Note 2 which is jest a small version of the 10.1 with a phone.\n\nOverall ... functional with Lots of potential. However of your net planning on taking lots of handwritten notes or using the sketching apps that take advantage of The integrated WACOM digitizer, yatto stick to the TAB or a Kindle Fire model that are well priced."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I was looking for an ideal tablet to take notes & rid myself of the tons of printing and barrage of papers I'd have to deal with in my law classes, which have a lot of pdfs of cases, articles, etc. I wanted to be able to annotate pdfs clearly and with ease. After researching a bit, I knew the Ipad and most tablets under $400 were out. Heavy note taking needs tablets that support a pressure sensitive, active stylus.  A tablet using an active stylus has a higher price tag than the average tablet, and that narrowed it down to the surface & Note 10.1. The high price of v the Surface led me to the Note.\n\nOnce you find the right combo of note and annotating apps, you do not at all miss old fashioned paper or a laptop for those tasks. Some highlights:\n\n- S pen: the number one highlight of the Note is the S pen. It's like I'm practically writing with pen and paper.  I'm kind of a paper purist.  I had preferred writing my agenda in journals over Google calendar as of late,  but this is like the best of both worlds.  I get the freedom of blank pen and paper with the right note apps along with the advantages of digital storage so I'm not lugging around tons of papers and journals.\n\n  -Multi window: This allows me to treat my tablet like a textbook and notepad in one-I put my readings on one side of the screen and place the note pad on the other. To do this you need apps that support the multi window function. The best to me are the lecture notes PDF viewer and a note app called Write. I cannot overstate the importance of this for class note taking. Without multi window, it'd be like placing your textbook on top of your notebook instead of having the notebook next to it, and every single time you want to write something,having to get the notebook from under your text book. Switching between windows is a headache and a time waster, so multiwindow resolves that. The s pen and multiwindow alone set the Note leaps and bounds above any $600 or less tablet you can find.\n\n- handwriting to text function: though not perfect , it helps having a tablet that supports detailed handwriting as a replacement for keying in letters. I did some of this review with the handwrite to text feature, some with the stock swipe keyboard feature (which is superb) and the other with voice to text. It helps because I absolutely hate writing on virtual keyboards and these features do a pretty decent job with accuracy especially the swipe keyboard and voice to text.\n\n- the Android system: because I use Google for so many of my everyday internet needs including Google Drive,Gmail, Google Calendar, Keep, and for searching, I want a device that seamlessly syncs all of those accounts. My only apprehension with recommending the Note to everybody is that some people are really used to iOS. But the features are just miles ahead of iPads that I would recommend it anyway. Despite a possible steep learning curve, it's worth it."}

I use autodesk sketchbook pro *mobile edition* with my note, and it works pretty good with a few minor inconveniences.\nI was on the fence about buying a tablet for years, and now I wonder how I ever lived without one. Break time at work is a pleasure now, and the longer I have my tablet the more I learn to love it!\n\nWHAT IS THE NOTE 10.1, WHY BUY THIS TABLET AND NOT SOME OTHER?---\n\nI have since used several tablets and can honestly say this tablet is a rockstar for its price point and what it can do, but only if you care about the drawing or painting. The S-pen is not like buying a kindle fire and some 3rd party pen. That sucks compared to what the Galaxy note can do.\n\nTablets that were not built with Wacom digitizer technology can not use pens with small fine point tips like the galaxy notes can. Those other tablets have to use ugly thick point tips that use a fragile material that will crack and peel away, or other strange pens with flat silicon transparent tips. I have heard a lot of artists gripe about how lousy these solutions are on various art forums, and I can see why.\nWith the note you get a nice fine point tip, with incredible precision, and much more pen tip durability.\n\nTHE S-PEN---\n\nI use a Cintiq 22HD at home, and while obviously better for drawing, the note still holds up surprisingly well for drawing. The S pen isn't quite as good as an intuos and cintiq pen, but still the lines are extremely accurate on screen. The pressure sensitivity is decent though you may wish to adjust this. There is no cintiq\\intuous style tilt support, but there is pressure sensitivity, which can be adjusted but requires opening the pen with a screw driver in a sorta awkward kind of way.\n\nThe pen button is my personal biggest disappointment, as I can't set it to do what I want in drawing apps like swap to eraser or undo. The included pen also has no eraser on the end, you have to buy a different pen for that, which does not fit in this devices' pen slot, so you have to carry it separate which kinda goes against the whole portability of this tablet thing, so I just manage with the included pen.\n\nThe pen as I mentioned earlier has a small tip unlike all them other ugly 3rd party pens you get with most all other tablets. The tip is silicon though, which produces more drag when drawing then what you are used to if you use an intuos or cintiq. Instead of feeling like easy to slide plastic on plastic or glass, you get a rubber on abrasive plastic kind of feel, so it takes more muscle to move the pen. This lends well to do careful thoughtful lines, but not as well for loose sketches. Even so it isn't horrible or anything. There are just days when I am in the mood for this silicon grip feel, and then days when I just want to loosely flick my pen across the canvas. Some people might be very bothered by this.\n\n*EDIT*-- I have since learned that normally when you buy a note, they come with extra nibs. My refurbished note 10.1 only came with 1 nib that was in the stylus, and was the soft silicon type. I bought a stylus with an eraser to get the harder plastic nibs I really wanted and am now even happier with the S pen***\n\nTHE SCREEN---\n\nI wasn't sure I would want such a large screen before buying, but after using this I can say for drawing that I would have been disappointed with the smaller samsung models. I feel 10 inches is about perfect compromise between portability and canvas size. It's just small enough to fit in my wide winter coat inside pouches, though most jackets probably won't have wide enough pouches to do this.\n\nI have seen newer I-pads and such that have brilliant screens. The note clearly is not as high resolution, at least not this older model. The newer 2014 note 10.1's have a much improved resolution. Even so, these older and cheaper note 10.1's have \"imo\" a darn good screen that is more then high enough resolution for me. It still is a great looking screen compared to all the el' cheapo tablet brands.\nThe screen surface is very durable too, I haven't got a scratch yet after my months of use, whereas I've seen some cheap brand tablets with all kinds of screen damage.\n\nThe screen size is wonderful but you should know that you should ROOT this tablet! The navigation bar that is ALWAYS taking up screen space *even when it's not lit up, it's a black bar on the bottom hogging up screen space*, and ALWAYS getting in the way, because some genius decided to put it at the bottom instead of the top, and gave no options to move it is annoying. I would constantly hit this bar and do all sorts of things I didn't want to do, such as go back, or to the home page, or go into settings.\nRooting was easy but took a little reading up. There are plenty of free apps to let you remove the nav bar, or change how it works, or when it shows up. I personally use \"fullscreen!\".\nI should also note that the nav bar thing is a common problem on many tablets using older versions of android.\n\nTHE POWER---\nThe 4 cores give this thing a fair bit of power. Swapping back and forth between apps is very fast. This thing multitasks pretty well. I commonly have sketchbook pro, music, and reference pictures up at the same time, and it clicks along just fine *though I have crashed it once or twice doing this heh*.\n\nI can play 3d games like \"angry birds go\" very smoothly. I have yet to find a 3d game that my tablet can't handle, and very well too. There are more powerful tablets, but this thing is still playing the top of the line games available to tablets.\n\nspeaking of multitasking---\nSome programs like the gallery, internet, or pdf files can work in dual window mode *push the pin tack on the windows to make it stay put when drawing* which is very helpful, since I like to put ref on 1 half my screen and have canvas on the other half for drawing practice. But again rooting helps here too with plenty of programs that require your tablet to be rooted, but can allow ANY program to work with the multi-window mode.\n\nThis tablet will burn through the battery at a reasonable rate *like 5 hours or less* if you have the brightness cranked up to 100%, and using the pen. I like having the brightness at 25% or less at night, and more like 50% at day, and so it definitely can go a few more additional hours when used like this. If you are new to tablets, know that changing brightness can be done on the fly *just click on the clock on the nav bar, and adjust the slider that is right there on the pop up menu*.\n\nCONCLUSION--\nThis tablet is a blast. It runs 2d and 3d games very fluidly, and the large vibrant screen gives a good quality that will make just about any el cheapo tablet look bad, but won't impress your friends on newer more expensive tablets. The sound isn't half bad too with speakers on the front like all good tablets should have, but often don't. If you are not into drawing, I would probably recommend the galaxy tab 3 instead as a bargain tablet with power.\n\nFor people who like to draw or paint, I can't imagine anything being better except the two thousand dollar cintiq tablets. This is a wonderful entry level cintiq basically, and it is a computer too that you can take with you, that plays music, games, movies, open all them art books you should be studying from. There are a few days where I actually prefer my note for drawing over my cintiq, as it does have it's own unique, personal, and compact feel.\n\nThis tablet is not a joke for drawing, it's a wonderful draftsman's companion that feels like your own personal dairy and fully functional computer all in one, wonder device. Get sketchbook pro, it's like 5 bucks on mobile app stores, setup your double tap buttons on the corners for undo and clear canvas, put on some music, and have fun! The Galaxy Note 10.1 rocks!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I was one of those that scorned at the rising trend of tablets, thinking it unnecessary and show-off toys. But then my inner tech-geek started to yearn for one. They're small, they're easy to just stuff in your bag, brining with you loads of entertainment and utilities all the time. Being a university student I used to bring my Macbook to school for taking notes. It was heavy and clumsy.\n\nBringing the Note along is so easy and it doesn't weight anything. In fact, I never leave home without it now.\n\nThe primary use I had in mind for it was note-taking during lectures and classes. It offers a wide variety for doing so just with with the tools that is already installed on the tablet. You can freehand with the pen, you can have your handwriting translated into text, and you can write as if on a computer.\n\nA bonus is that it offers a variety of drawing apps for when I get dead bored in school. Doodling is more fun, and so easy with the tablet!\n\nIt has become my saviour during my all-in-all 2 hour trip to school and back home. It's easy to just dig it out from your bag and start watching films, the screen is nice with good colours and clarity, or read a book. There is apps out there that's really good both for films and reading. I started to read solely on this tablet, abandoning my Sony e-reader because the tablet had better app-utilities for reading (stuff that the new Kindle Paperwhite have so I'm going to give that one a try now).\n\nAll in all, I use it far more than I ever thought I would, and to do various tasks and for enjoyment. The battery life is good and quite normal. When using it sparsely it lasts for days. When using it more heavily it can lasts for about 2 days with no problem.\n\nIt has given me my money's worth and I'm pleased with it."}

But I think it's worthwhile.\nIt comes with photoshop touch, and a few other s pen apps for note taking or picture editing or drawing.\nIt works with a micro sd card, so I didn't feel the need to pay 50$ extra for 16 additional gb when I got a 32 gb sd card for 20$.\n\n(Update)\nI have had this tablet for a while now and for the longest time it sat unused, because note taking is better done by pen and paper. But when I was assigned online homework in calculus, this was pretty useful for it. I'm going to admit that my eyes did feel pretty tired after using it for a few hours, noticeably more than my phone or computer screen affects me. Since it is not a full fledged PC there was online coursework that I wish I could have used it for but I don't see the point in using a computer and a tablet when a pen and paper won't hurt my eyes after a long assignment. Overall I feel that the tablet doesn't compel me to use it for more than my calculus work."}

There are far easier and cheaper was to do this. The tablet itself is nice with some good\nfeatures. So if you want the note go for 32GB or you'll be sorry.

But, Alas! after plugging the charger in for a couple of hours and seeing a battery charge symbol on the screen I elected to turn in on and________---------________ Nothing! I held-in the start button for 10, 20, 30 seconds up to a couple of minutes and one time the screen came alive with some inverted yellow triangle flashing. It then went dead again. Left the charger on over-night and again, the screen with the yellow triangle. Unplugged the charger and the screen did come on for about three minutes until I tilted it upward from the table.  I am now assuming. the battery was defective. I called Amazon and within a few minutes I was connected to great rep and with Great empathy on his part (it was my birthday when this was delivered). we agreed to trade-up for a new 32 gig model. With overnight delivery my new Galaxy note arrived exactly on time with delivery charges paid by Amazon. The new one rocks and I am overwhelmed by all the apps and I can now draw without lugging around a box full of art supplies.\nMy major cons for the product is there should be a led indicator light when powering up like my Dell Laptop does.\nThe power connector even when using the tablet case/cover. is still pinched against the table since your connector is in the middle on the bottom when the tablet is in the vertical position.."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Liking it so far. Have the Note Phone and thought it would be basically the same functions, but the set up is quite different.  The Help section could definitely be better.  But they do give you a little manual. (I prefer reading than being stuck watching a 5 minute video instead of spending 15 seconds reading how to find a function.)\n\nThere is one drawback which, to me is quite problematic and could become huge over time.  I'll update this review if it does.\n\nThe power cord attachment is at the bottom of the tablet rather than the side.  So if you want to put it in a case that allows you to position it in an upright  or easel position  while charging, the Power attachment is scrunched against the desk or bottom surface, with the cord bent over.  I hope it won't ruin the connection over time and keep it from charging.\n\nThe case I bought has an opening for the charger, so that you can put it in easel position.  But if you try to just open the case, and go directly to easel position you risk bending the power attachment. To get it to work you have to detach the tablet from the cover then move it. (Separate Review).\n\nI had an iPad 2 before, where charger is at the side.  Hope the patent office didn't give Apple the rights to a side charge, as present set up does not make sense.  Hopefully someone will come up with a case to offset the problem."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "This was an early birthday gift from my husband, since I will be going abroad for work around that time.  I had told him I wanted it since we both have the Note 2 phones.  I love the S pen feature because I take a lot of notes for work and it's easier than using my finger tip and a lot cleaner.  I also tend to send a lot of letters to Taiwan, so using the S Note, I can easily write a note and pass email it.  Rather than taking days to get there, it only takes minutes.\n\nI like the wide range of keyboard options.  Using the English keyboard, Spanish words also pop up. It makes it easier rather than swapping between English and Spanish even though they both use a Romantic alphabet.  My biggest gripe with the language inputs are the Chinese pops up first the simplified characters.  I have to dig through characters to find the traditional characters.  There also is not a Japanese option available for download unless I go to the Play Store.  Of course, I can always use the S pen to write in the characters if I want to take a quick note, however if i wish to type, it's a little harder.\n\nThe camera is pretty good, both front and back.  My three year old loves to take pictures, so it's fun for him as well.\n\nUnlike the Note 2, the bottom of the screen has a little box to take a screen shot. It's easy, especially if you need to send someone instructions or an example.\n\nIt comes with Polaris Office downloaded, so if you do a lot with word documents, excel, or powerpoint, you can email them to yourself and edit from home or on the go.\n\nThe USB adapter for the wall is nice as it can easily separate.  The only thing I don't like is how short the cord is.  It's only about 2 feet long.\n\nThe front of the tablet has two speakers, so no having to lay it down to hear sounds.  If you're watching Youtube, you can hear it better than using your smartphone since the speakers are towards you.  The screen is also big, so you can see the videos better.  It's much easier to gather a crowd around this than your iPhone (if that's your style). I have 118 coworkers in my company, so we are constantly interacting and using this during meetings to take notes or reflect data is better than wasting paper.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this to anyone who inquires.  Better than Apple products."}

Could not make a better choice. I have been looking a device for productivity purposes (current College Student).\n\nThe best of this tablet is the note taking experience (Spen actually). Non-touch screen laptop misses quick graphic drawing and formula annotation, while other tablets are just meant for entertainment.\n\nI do not own a touch screen laptop because is beyond my budget, so I carry this 5.5 pounds (2.5kg) laptop + college/work luggage. So I have been looking for an option that allows me:\n-Excel\n-Internet browsing\n-PDF reading\n-Amazing note taking experience\n-Note searching and organization\n-Calendar that syncs between Andriod, PC and iOS\n-Comfortable screen size\n-Light weight and portability\n\nAbout portability, in my case I don't always manage to obtain e-books, so\n\nThe plus of being able to do most of the mentioned tasks on a dual screen is handy.

I just wanted to let those interested know where I bought mine.\n\nUPDATE: July 21\n\nIt's unfortunate, but my tablet is being returned.

I did do a master reset for the hell of it, but it didn't fix the problem. It was fulfilled by Amazon, so no worries because returning it is always hassle free and also free. I liked the tablet for its focus on productivity and the Spen is simply great. I still don't want to pay $488 (includes tax+fees) for something that came out almost a year ago and a newer model is likely due soon so I ordered another refurbished unit from the same seller, $300 (tax+fees free).

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "First a little bit of context, I work on software development and I usually have to attend client meetings to retrieve information about the systems and apps they want built, a lot of these meetings also entail showcasing beta versions of their requirements and/or the suite of apps I' ve already developed for other companies.\n\nThis tablet has dispensed me of the need to carry my 17 inch laptop everywhere since all I need to show my web applications is a weblink stored in the tablet (and a wifi connection of course). Also, I use both google calendar and Lotus Notes to schedule meetings and possible work at the clients' facilities and email messaging, both these services sync seamlessly with my smartphone (a samsung Galaxy Note 1) .\n\nSince I tend to write down a lot of notes during meetings, the stylus was a feature I was pumped for in this tablet, and I have to say it is the closest you can get to pen and paper without having to invest in more expensive wacom digitizers. Another great feature on this tablet is the fact that I can sync the notes I take using the S Note app with my smartphone instantly, so even if I leave the tablet at home I still carry all my meeting data with me.\n\nAs a media consumption/entertainment device the Note 10.1 is very good but not the greatest.\n\nOn the plus side, the Note10.1 comes with the PEEL remote app which lets you sync the tablet with your TV and DVR and it works as an universal remote. It has access to both google play video, google play music and samsung media hub right out of the box; it also supports DLNA.\n\nA great hardware feature found on this and all 10 inch samsung tablets is the placement of stereo speakers on both sides of the tablet facing the user, and not on the back like most vendors tend to place them, this makes harder for the user to block them while holding the device and projects the sound better.\n\nThe tablet also comes with a microSD expansion slot up to 32GB so you have a generous amount of space for music and HD video.\n\nWhat hampers this tablet media capabilities however: it's screen resolution (a weak 1280x800 versus the 1920x1200 of the Asus Transformer Prime, which also offers microSD expansion capabilities).\n\nSo, if you are looking for a solid 10 inch productivity tablet with a solid performance and good media consumption capabilities, this is a great choice, if you are, however, in the market for an entertainment tablet then the choice should go to either the Asus Transformer Prime or Nexus 10 on the Android side of things or the iPad Retina on the iOS side."}

The pen is such a cool stuff for taking notes, It helps u take out your creative side and play with it.\n\nI was a little bit worried about what people said about the screen, because everybody cries saying that 1200x800 px isn't good enough and that u can't see anything and that your eyes are gonna get hurt with that screen resolution. I say all that is ****. I lock at the screen closely and I can't find a single detail blurry or otherwise different that I would see it on my 1900x1200 laptop. Its all about marketing.\n\nI was between this and the nexus 10 which is a great tablet with a gorgeous screen but I decided to buy this one because It can do so muuch more than any other tablet in the market right now and that is much more important to me than a beautiful screen.

Also, it is fast as hell, don't let any fool make you think otherwise (specially the people that says that multitask makes the tablet lag).\n\nThis tablet is also very light (which is one of the biggest pros of a tablet), its also very well made (even though is plastic) and it feels great on your hands. The only thing that is not so cool about it is that you can't find easily a cover for it. There are not many places in Mexico [That's the reason for my bad English  - Srry ]  where you can buy it (I had to buy it online) but that is just the price of buying a not so popular item as the ipad.\n\nI hope this review helps someone to decide wether or not to buy this item as the way that  others reviews helped me to decide, there are a lot of marketing on the internet that may confuse you and sometimes is a cool thing to look at someone who bought the product and see how things went for him/her\n\nI freaking love it =)"}

I access the internet via wifi and it has worked flawlessly. The screen is bright and refreshingly HD quality viewing. The processor is very fast and opening multible apps on one screen is smooth and convenient. One issue I was concerned about was the ability to print to my HP printer. With HP ePrint, it is a breeze. I was even able to load all my favorites from IE and Firefox. Unless you are needing a gaming PC, desktops will be filed with the Edsel. Tablets are the future. This Samsung unit is an excellent choice."}

I have bought Samsung products over than 20 times since my twenty..from 2G cell phone, smart phone,desktop, laptop, smart TV...ect. I don't think Samsung works this way. Even in 1990's there's no dust under vinyl seal and that seal had no wrinkle.\nIf it's not Amazon's fault, I will leave this comment on Samsung website and user's blog too with pictures taken with my DSLR.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Pros: Great looking screen (wish it was higher res though). Beautifully calibrated/ functioning S-Pen. Haptic feedback is nice touch to this ipad user. IR good for tv remote which works great btw, no waiting to sync up each time app closes/reopens. GPS is fast. Included S- Note is a great app contrary to some other reviews calling it \"clunky\".\n\nCons: I'm having battery charging issues though! Using supplied Samung charger I plug in, go to bed, wake up and its at 26%? Battery icon shows it's charging. MANY people have this problem since update to JellyBean from ICS. As of now I must Hard shut down to get to full charge and sometimes that doesn't even do it. No confidence at all, many wasted minutes assuming charge was in progress. I cant just plug in and continue using, very frustrating! Apparent need to clear out tasks, memory, etc --much more maitenance than ipad.\nArtistic Apps are way behind on android than ios! Across several apps functions like zoom cause temporay blackout on screen during active scaling.  Also noteable is fact that top shelf art apps such as Layer Paint, Infinate painter have crashed several times since purchase (lucky ive only been screwing around). Brush lag in realtime stroke rendering has been unacceptable in many cases on android apps -compared to ipad apps(Paper 52) where i have been impressed and i'm using hardware inferior Ipad 2!\n\nFinal: I love the idea of this tablet and look forward with fingers crossed to better apps that utilize great hardware and superior S-pen!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Don't have a single regret on buying this device, well except for hoping that Samsung would one of these days use some steel and make a device with a premium finish!!\n\nPros:\n- Excellent performance: I've experienced no lag at all with this device. It runs even the latest app/game in the market without even a hitch. Multi-tasking works like a charm. Of course, you got to remember that when you run two apps side-by-side, you really can't expect the same level of smoothness as when running just a single app.\n- This device is amazingly versatile. The main reason I bought this specific device was due to the integration of the stylus. Using the stylus, this device adds multiple levels of additional productivity to most of the activities you could perform with the device.\n- Even after a year of having purchased this device, still I find it difficult to find a direct competitor to this device.\n\nCons:\n- I rally wish that Samsung would build at least some of their top-end devices with a more premium finish!! This also holds true for this device. Even though, the device does not feel fragile or cheap to the touch, still, the build of the device could have been much better.\n- Screen resolution. Wish the screen packed a bit more pixels to give it a higher resolution\n\nWould recommend for anyone looking for a good Android Tab. I would say that this is still one of THE BEST Android Tablets that are available at the moment."}

I was not disappointed, it does everything I wanted and more. It has very fast response time when surfing the net, charges quickly, the audio ain't too bad for the very small speakers it uses and the placement of the speakers give good stereo sound. I have to say I don't use the pen much because of what I do with the tablet dose not call for the use of the pen and because of the 10.1 screen you can use your finger when doing most tasks. I highly recommend it."}

It wasn't until I used a friend's Note that I realized this could actually be useful for business as well as theocratic purposes.  I've used it for both during meetings several times now, and taking notes on it is more than realistic, its just like paper!  With, of course, the added benefit of being able to keep all your notes electronic.  Besides note taking, its a great device for study, research and yes, even playing (it even controls my TV, too cool!)  I've had several geek outs over the last few days, and I'm delighted with this tablet.  I did go with the refurb model, and the tablet itself came just like new, no problems.  However, the company that fulfilled the order for Amazon sent the wrong charging cable.  I went on a 6 store quest to find the right one, finally getting one that worked at the corporate Verizon store.  Word to the wise, even if the charger fits and says its for Samsung tables, don't walk out of the store until you've tried plugging it in and charging the tablet!  I got a red X on the battery when I tried to use a charger from Best Buy, 'el cheapo!\n\nAs far as useful apps, here's a few I found:\n\nLecture Notes - use instead of the S Note app that comes with the Note, its worth the 5 bucks!\nezPDF Reader - great for studying literature and annotating\nDropBox - sync files between devices and your computer if you use with the tablet\n\nI highly recommend this tablet if you're in the market.  I haven't used iPad at all, but I know this has quite a few features that iPad does not, including the stylus, active touchscreen, multi-window support and easy access to the file system.  Oh yeah, and I installed FireFox and Adobe Flash for the full Internet experience... try that on an Apple device!"}

I was interested in buying a new one rather than using a repaired 7 inch tab !!\n\nSo, I thought of buying one more Galaxy tab, instead after seeing reviews on Note 10.1 inch, I went for it. This is the best product and my kid likes it very much. She watches a lot of cartoons and plays lot of puzzles in this one.\n\nBattery is not very bad, it comes approximately for 1.5 days when moderately used and under heavy usage not more than 1 day.

The main reason I bought this product over other brands was because I can always install and sd card for more memory,well I was wrong. I haven't  found yet one way to move my apps to the sd card as samsung disable that function. If you know a way let me know.\nThe reason #2 was because I have my prime membership and I like to watch movies,well that's not possible thanks to amazon...There's not amazon instant video app supporting android,not for this tablet and for a few others,so no matter if you installed flash player,it won't work because of this.\nTalking about flash player...Yes you can install flash player,how? Easy....\n\nFirst go to your tablet setting,click on security and allow Unknown Sources otherwise you won't be able to download anything....\n\nIf you're running android jelly bean all you have to do is...\ngo to the adobe archive page find the latest android apk...\nFlash player  for android  4.0 archives\nFlash player 11.1 for android 4.0 (11.1.115.54)\nDownload it directly to your tablet or phone\nDownload firefox browser from the play store\nOpen  adobe flash player with firefox and go to the setting,enable  plug in.\nAnd that's it.\n\nOne other thing I like is that I can use xbmc,perfect to watch all the movies I have on my computer without having to use the sd card. Please make sure not to download the official version as it won't work very well. Download the version for neon device as your galaxy note it's neon,you can find it in the xbmc page. It work like dime for me.\n\nOther than I can't move apps to the sd card I like everything about this tablet so if that doesn't bother you go for it as the battery it is also great.\nThanks for reading and please forgive my English."}

People talk about having to call into Samsung support over and over and over again, the flippant attitudes of the support people, and the unwillingness for Samsung to stand behind their product and provide a new unit when it's obvious a unit is defective.\n\nFor the complete lack of customer support and poor quality/design, I will not be buying ANY Samsung tablet.

I love my S3, so a Samsung tab was the logical choice.  Being a distaff dweeb, that would be the 10.1 Note.  I suffer from analysis paralysis,  so I had to look at all available, and there are some tempting choices in the market place. I own many Samsung products, and am delighted with all.  So, the Note it was to be.  Amazon offered a refurb on Prime.  A fabulous price, the color I wanted,  and two-day delivery!  Don't be hesitant about a refurb.  Mine was delivered in pristine condition.\n\nI view my Note as a Samsung Galaxy S3 on steroids without the cell function.  There is practically no learning curve, although in three days, I haven't explored everything it can do.\n\nOne caution:  When setting it up, it will ask for your location.  Don't use the swipe to select your country.  The screen is very sensitive.  I accidentally selected Kazakhstan, thought I could change it in the settings, and was wrong.  The device must be reset.  Use direct entry in the space at the top of the country list.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Note is absolutely awesome.  After I've had it a bit longer, and discover more about it, I'll add to the review."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I bought mine 5 months ago, and I was waiting to review it once I used it for a while to give a good review, but after 5 months I still have no cons.\n\nBattery life - even if you use it a lot, it lasts longer than my current phone. I have used it at school all day and still been able to play on it at home without charging. If you don't use it very much I have gone 5 days on one charge. (I have nothing on Push settings or the brightness us too high though). I typically charge every night and by the end of the day still have at least 10% and I use it a lot.\n\nDurability - I have not dropped it on the ground but I bring it everywhere with me in my bookbag where books and pencil bags knock into it and nothing has happened. Only scratch is the one it was shipped with (it was a refurbished model I bought and the scratch was only noticeable to me because I scoured it, when I asked everyone else no one found it until I pointed it out) I do have a cheap case on it too.\n\nUsefulness - I could go on for HOURS talking about how useful it is. The S note can record sound and record writing as you are taking notes. PERFECT for any college student or business person in a meeting. You can scroll through the sound clips after you save to find exactly what you are looking for. The multi-screen thing is BRILLANT! I can't even help but cap-lock on these things, I love this product so much. I used the multi screen for up to 4 things and it still ran fast. I opened everything I could open to test it and it still ran fast (that ran obviously a little slower than usually but still everything was so fast it surprised me I expected it to crash). I think it was like 20 things open with my Chrome having at least 15 tabs inside and it was still functional. Photoshop App that comes with it, totally rocks. You have the best features on the go and the stylus works so well with it. There is a mode that detects your eyes so when you watch a movie, it won't just turn off on you. This also helped while reading textbooks and taking notes because sometimes if you have it to auto turn off too soon it would have turned off by that but it notices your eyes with the front camera.\n\nI can't even go into detail about everything, but it is the best tablet on the market if you need it for art or school. Hands down. I saved up so long and I am so happy with it. Everything was taken into account on this tablet, so many small details that you just discover and think wow. The first 3 weeks I learned something more useful every day. There is a auto block feature so your emails won't come through when your sleeping. You can change the standard font. When you are asked in a app how do you want to view this picture (for example it happens differently too) you can click on the gallery and when the app leaves the page it is like the powerpoint slide shows it skews the bottom and scrolls off the page, so fricking cute! So the Jellybean and Note together work so well. Everyone in my family has Ipads, and every single person is jealous of this. I love it. I am always recommending it to everyone. If you have doubt go to a store and try it in stores (that is what I did) and you can see how you like it.\n\nAlso there is an aftermarket pen that is useful and more comfortable than the small stylus if you have bigger hands that still has pressure sensitivity."}

Packing a Exynos quadcore 1.4GHz processor and a Mali-400 graphics chipset, this tablet has horsepower to spare. But power isn't everything. 2013 is here and the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 still outshines newer model android tablets. It's no longer the fastest, most graphically impressing tablet on the market. That would arguably go to the Nexus 10, also made by Samsung, which has a better DPI than even the iPad 4. Getting back to the topic on hand, this tablet screams productivity. The multitasking aspect coupled with the ability of the S Pen makes this a students' and business mans' dream. It has all the features that come standard with Android's with some special apps from Samsung. At launch, the Note had some problems with slow downs when running android ICS. After the Jellybean update, the Note better utilizes its hardware and software creating a very smooth experience. No inconsistent lag / twitchyness and more apps can be put onto the screen instead of just 2 by using cascade mode. I found myself opening 4 apps, filling every corner of the screen. One for note taking, another for emails, another for video, and 1 more for internet browsing and this time more apps are allowed for multitasking instead of just factory installed apps. The features this tablet has to offer is its strongest selling point. Until other tablets can multi-window / multitask like the Note can, I'd say this tablet will be a terrific buy for busy bodies. Oh and it has an IR blaster which can control your cable box and tv. Just a little more frosting for the cake."}

It took 2 weeks for repairs.  Upon the return  my unit was sent to the wrong address...when  It finally arrived to me,  Packaging was horrendous!! my unit was placed inside an old/used sandwich-bag placed inside an oversize bent-up-box with no filler/stuffing thus, the unit was scuffed pretty good.\nIf that wasn't bad enough they left out the adapter... I've called Samsung over 50 times  To resolve my issues but I get no where!!! Today 4/23/13 a month later and i still haven't been able to use the unit because i still have no adapter!!!  I called again today and was told by a rep that I should look for the adapter cause maybe it's at the first address they sent it to....  wooooow really???\nok at this point  The curse-words started rolling off my tongue!!! so the rep tells me, she can order me a new adapter but it will take 5 business days and if I want it faster I can buy one.\n\n I wanted to send this unit back to Amazon.com but Samsung has held up the progress because of the adapter and my 30 days  return warranty has expired with Amazon.\n\nI would have never had this problem with Apple."}

Then I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.0 7 and it was great but not quite large enough to see the videos I wanted to view. I'm not as techy as some reviewers but I do know what's easy and what's a pain. I didn't get this on Amazon because I couldn't find it and finally purchased at Best Buy.  I'm in love, I pad eat your heart out.  This is a fantastic tablet.  It's productive and fun.  I have played with it for hours and actually have used it daily since I purchased it. I have only had it for a little over a week and I keep learning what it will do.  I installed drop box and now I have imported all my photos from my computers.  I'm overwhelmed at the quality.  Don't pass this one up.  It's everything in one sleek package  I do think that a case is in order as the top of the tablet, housing for the rear facing camera is a little wiggly.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I've used pretty much every portable tool... smart phones, net books, laptops, and several other tablets.\nThe thing that makes this tablet different is the S Pen digital stylus.  You can write and draw on this tablet as\nefficiently as you do on paper.  Unlike using a stylus on a capacitive screens, the S Pen tip glides smoothly\nand accurately on the glass ... like pen on paper.  So you can take notes or sketch out diagrams easily.  No\nother stylus-tablet combo worked for me.\n\nThe handwriting recognition (converting my chicken scratch to text type) works fabulously.  And a huge bonus is the ability\nto have multiple programs open at once... so I can read or watch video and take notes at the same time.\n\nCompare CPU specs and screen resolution all you want.  The Note works great for all the other things (like music,\nweb, video and books).  Maybe you can see the difference side by side in a store.... but no other tablet I tried works this\nwell for note taking or drawing.  My other 3 tablets are now collecting dust."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Bought it as a gift for my wife who was complaining that her first gen iPad is slow, apps keep crashing all the time and frankly it was really annoying. iPad 1 still works but it is slow (each OS update makes it slower and slower instead of faster because they don't optimize for this as a ploy to make you want a new iPad which'll appear faster).\nAlso wanted to get out of Apple ecosystem because although its products are well worth the money and spectacular and they are the true pioneers and innovators (who remembers buying a tablet before ipad or smartphone before iphone that was really smart), lately their marketing has been - screw the customers, we know whats best and we tell you what you need. It is also not innovating as much now and not giving people what they want - bigger screens and meaningful upgrades.\n\nSo I switched and got the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 because it was on sale for $50 off and I got it in 1 day shipping thanks to Amazon.\n\nThe unit is beautiful - light and the white is nice. It is actually too slick. So I bought a Poetic cover as well. There is an expansion slot (up to 32GB only) and I popped in the Sandisk 32GB card. I also upgraded the OS to 4.1.2 as of now (one thing to note is if you get an error - firmware was modified outside and so no updates will be possible, then you need to remove the SD card and retry and it will be fine. Bug in HW check coding).\n\nThe screen resolution is lower and it sometimes shows but it is more than adequate. The unit came charged thankfully. With moderate use, I lost about 24% a day - one netflix movie, browsing, emails etc. about 3 hours used.\nOn standby it seems to lose about 15% a day. So the battery life is more than adequate. We may need charging every 3 days or so.\n\nThe unit is blazing fast. The quad core really shows here. Everything is super zippy. With 2GB memory, you can easily launch like 10 apps at a time and also it can truly multitask (only approved apps) so you can have more apps running at same time if you choose.\n\nThe swype keyboard is brilliant as is the S-Voice. However, some output seems wrong. I asked \"how far is Canada from United States\" and it said \"1530 miles\" or something which is a head scratcher.\n\nThe S-pen is just brilliant. Handwriting to sketching to jotting notes. Simply brilliant. You will need to buy more apps to fully leverage its power though. The samsung store/play store is good as well.\n\nThe screen is crisp and clear but I can tell the iPad is sharper and crispier and seems more \"vibrant\" and HD sharp than this one.\n\nOverall, this seems like a much better buy than an iPad. However, if people would want an iPad, I would say it is still worth it for its better screen resolution and intuitiveness. (for. e.g. I couldn't figure out how to delete the accidentally created 7 home screens. Not easily intuitive. Also had to bing how to remove the \"Tap and hold to remove items\" wording on the screen.\n\nFinal rating : 9/10  (by contrast iPad would be 9.5/10)"}

For the latter, there really is no replacement for the Nexus series - Google will always make sure that they get the software updates first and that they don't have any restrictive bloatware like Amazon-based or other weird versions of Android. That said Samsung is getting a close 2nd in \"Android purity\" these days, and the Note 10.1 shows it off. Besides the fact I was able to get a great deal on an ultra-clean refurb'd device, I went with the Note 10.1 over the Nexus 10 because of the SD card slot. More memory = more media to take on plane rides/etc.\n\nThis is a great device. If you're in the market, it has to be near the top of your list."}

She typically doesn't need the full functionality of a typical PC or Laptop.  The display is definitely not on the same level as the iPad but it does the job.  Also, this tablet screen seems to collect more \"smudge\" marks than others.  I find the processor to be quick and efficient but some minor things like closing windows and navigation through different \"panes\" can be a challenge at first.  I find it annoying learning all of the little \"tricks\" that are needed to make this tablet as efficient as possible.  But as soon as we/she learns the operating system I'm sure it will be just fine.  Also,  there needs to be more cohesion between these developers.  Just to get this thing up and running we had to start a samsung account (which is useless) a google play account, just simplify this crap already ONE ACCOUNT makes life much easier."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "This is the first tablet I have bought,  I'm usually a computer guy,  but I also have many notebooks which I use for various projects.\nThis tablet is amazing, it took me a few hours to get use to it,  but once I did,  it had become an amazing tool.\nI'm actually writing this review from it,  & I have to say,  is the little things that make a huge difference.\nFor example:\nI like using the tablet in portrate mode,  so with 2 clicks,  I was able to turn off the \"auto rotation\", YET when I clicked to watch a video on YouTube,  I was able to simply rotate the tablet & bam, the video is in landscape. As soon as I exited the video,  it automatically sent back into portrate.\n\nThe S-Pen does take getting used to, if you haven't used a stylus on a tablet before,  it works great.  S-Note's idea pad is very useful,  allowing you to add images,  video,  as well as audio into the notes.\n\nThe battery life is great,  I was using it one day, then put it to sleep (one click on the post button), and did open it till the next day, and it was still in the same battery level as before, and yes the wifi was on.\n\nThe S Calender automatically sync with my Google account as soon as I logged into the tablet.\nThe dual screen experiance works fine.\nFor the keyboard it has the Swype feature,  which I find easier then typing,  it can be turned on our off.\n\nThe E mail app that comes with it allows you to add different emails from different providers, ie gmail, go daddy, ect. And has a \"combined view\" , that shows you all the emails from all those inboxes. Even the gMail app works great on the tablet.\n\nThis tablet is very slim too, light, and powerful.\nIt's perfect if your a creative person,  especially some kind of artist or musician,  a note taker, or a student.\nI would absolutely recommend this over the iPad without a second thought.\n\nEnjoy"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "This is kind of biased because I am anti Apple products however Android can be a terrible experience if you don't have the right specs in the tablet itself. I'm a spec stickler when it comes to the internal components of computers and stuff but I think this has all the right specs with its quad core processor and 2gb ram. I actually bought this tablet for $350 from the warehouse deals and received it a couple days later (Amazon Prime). The tablet, was in near perfect condition in the original box with everything its suppose to come with. All the peelable plastic was still on and the screen was blemish/scratch free. I managed to find a teeny tiny scratch in the corner of the gray plastic. Otherwise, near perfect condition as I said.\n\nHere are the great things about this tablet.\n-Samsung released android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) for this tablet which equals better performance and a few extra things here and there.\n-16gb storage space is sufficient. I don't recommend buying the 32gb version because this has a Micro SD slot for extra storage space up to 64gb. Unless you love downloading lots of apps and downloading movies or something. I just stream everything media related via Hulu+, Netflix, Youtube, or Spotify/Pandora. So I don't care much for the space.\n-The quad core processor runs everything quickly and smoothly. The tablet runs as smooth as butter. No Hiccups.\n-The 2 Gb of RAM lets you multitask very well and you will never feel like the tablet is slowing down.\n-Samsung has their overlay over the stock android interface. Personally I like it a bit better.\n-Samsung has their own app market and they pre-install some apps on your tablet. The good news is they aren't complete junk. I find them useful because I'm a student.\n-very responsive. The touch screen is great.\n-the tablet has an IR blaster so I can control my own TVs and other things with the tablet.\n-Smart Stay. Samsung has an option called Smart Stay. Normally with a smart phone or tablet you will be looking at something on the screen. Occasionally you have to keep touching it for the screen to remain on without defaulting to off. With Smart Stay, the front facing camera will look at you. It will recognize when you are looking at the screen or when you are not looking at it. If you are looking at the screen the device will remain on and you don't have to do those occasional touches to reassure your tablet that you are still using it and make sure it doesn't automatically turn off.\n-on screen keyboard is customizable. Someone would think that a 10 inch wide screen is hard to type on. The keyboard can be changed in 3 different ways. It can be a big keyboard, a small keyboard that you can drag anywhere on the screen, or a split up keyboard that has half of a keyboard on one side of the screen and the other half on the other side. It works well if you are holding it widescreen so you can type with just your thumbs and still maintain a good hold on the tablet.\n\nSomething to note is that this tablet can do certain apps side by side on the screen. I think that's a new thing coming out but this is the first tablet i know of to be able to run apps side by side on the same screen at the same time.\n\nBad things (I think)\n\n-The S pen will go in this category because I don't particularly think its all that useful. However, I do use it for taking notes on the note app. The S pen inserts right into the tablet and blends in seamlessly. You'd never know its there unless you're looking for it. Again, the S pen is a personal opinion. I like having it as an option but I don't use it 95% of the time. Vanity is vanity I will say.\n-The screen resolution. A lot of phones and tablets nowadays are making a big deal bout ppi (pixels per inch). I will say things like Apples retina display or the amoled screen that samsung is using now on newer phones/tablets and the crazy resolution displays on the nexus tablets will kick this tablet's butt. The 1280x800 resolution looks good but if you are comparing detailed photos or something with those things I mentioned; It will seem lame. Words and pictures can look pixel-ee at times.\n-Another thing to note about the screen. When you are at the home screens, there is like a literal inch on both the left and right sides of the screen where you cannot place apps or anything. I feel like that is space that can be used for placing more icons or something but when you touch the empty space the home screen will go the next screen over. Same in your app drawer. I haven't found an option that can turn that off or whatever but I should let you know that. If it matters you can fit 56 app icons on one home screen. I'm a widget fan so I don't have the Ipad look of pure apps on a screen.\n-The speakers can get loud which isn't bad but when you turn the tablet from widescreen to tall screen (as I call it) I just think the tablet looks a bit weird especially since the speakers will be top and bottom and slightly to the right or left. This tablet was certainly meant to be used in widescreen which I'm okay with.\n\nOverall this is a great tablet. It looks good when I don't have it in the case and I looks good with my cool case too. The side front facing speakers get loud. Honestly I cannot think of a feature that this tablet doesn't have. Besides maybe a super cool high resolution screen there's really nothing other tablets can do that this one cannot. If anything this tablet has more features and more potential. If Samsung were to upgrade this thing they should put in one of those nice new octa-core processors and a nice AmoLED screen. If you are looking for a 10 inch tablet I would say this is a great one to buy. If not, I would probably point you in the direction of the new 8 inch note tablet that Samsung is releasing or the Nexus 10. There is a new wave of tablets and phones coming out this year so it might also be beneficial to wait and see if something better comes along in the near future."}

It will only open the installed browser, Snote, their version of the Office suite, and the photo gallery at the same time. It would be nice if they would allow other applications to write in this functionality, esp since Microsoft is ahead of them in this. Oh and it doesn't support flash from any browser and none of the apps in the store will help with that either. So no Netflicks or Amazon instant video"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I absolutely LOVE my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1!! I'm a college student and this is SOOOOO much more compatible with taking notes for my classes! Most of my instructors post our notes online and I can download them as a pdf file and use them on the S Note app to highlight and add notes with my S pen. With the camera I can take pics of the diagrams my instructors draw OR draw them myself on my Note! ALSO, because I can run 2 apps at one time on my screen, multitasking is a breeze! This tablet keeps all my schoolwork and day to day life so organized. I also have my nook and amazon kindle apps so I can read books and magazines. If you're a student wanting more from a tablet than surfing the internet and playing games, THIS is the tablet for you! Another big PLUS and MAJOR reason I got the Note 10.1 is the expandable memory. If there are some files on my computer I need on my tablet I get my mini sd card to transfer the files and upload them on my tablet. Super easy!! This tablet is definitely worth the $$ and I don't think I'll be purchasing any other type of brand from here on out!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I bought this tablet mainly for taking notes digitally to avoid the mess of paper that results from taking notes with a pen/pencil.  I wanted something light and relatively inexpensive, with an active digitizer stylus and decent battery life.  This immediately ruled out any Apple or Microsoft products.  Based on reading various reviews, choosing the Galaxy Note 10.1 was an easy decision.  After a few weeks of use, however, this tablet leaves much to be desired.  I'll comment on the tablet feature by feature:\n\nS Pen Stylus. this is, without a doubt, the main reason to buy this tablet.  For those who do not know, there are basically two kinds of tablet styli: Capacitive styli, which act like a finger and use the tablets regular capacitive touch to write; and active styli, which uses a different technology to register pen strokes.  Active styli benefit from having smaller tips (so you can see what you are doing), input that is independent of the capacitive screen (so you can prevent your palm from being registered as the tip), and better all-around accuracy.  Capacitive styli benefit from being usable with any table, whereas active pens need tablets specifically designed for them.  The Galaxy Note comes with an active stylus.  Writing on the Note is very different from writing on paper, but it is very doable.  It's still not as precise as pen or pencil, so I must write bigger, but the experience is more than adequate.  The active stylus is the main benefit of the Galaxy Note over other Android tablets.\n\nS Pen Software.  The software is where this tablet starts falling short of expectations.  The default note-taking software is called S Note, and it gets the job done.  However, there are a few big issues with it.  The first is that, while S Note has a feature to turn ignore the capacitive input and only take S Pen input, it still detects your hand for navigation.  If you rest your hand on the tablet, as many would, you may end up unintentionally and sporadically zooming in.  This has happened to me countless times already, and it is quite annoying.  The software is also quite slow to turn pages, so if want to go back a page or two to reference something, you'll end up forgetting some of it by the time you get back to the correct page you are working on.  Lastly, there is no good option to copy/paste notes.  If you copy part of your notes, it will copy the background as well.  I take my notes with the graph paper background, so when I paste a bit of notes from one page onto another, the grid of the graph paper will most likely not line up, which looks bad and breaks the flow of the notes.\n\nOther Software.  Things are worse in other software that is not designed for the S Pen.  For example, I like to annotate PDFs, and nothing designed for the S Pen was satisfactory for me.  I ended up getting a standard app.  However, since the S Pen input looks identical to the touch screen for this app, I cannot rest my hand on the tablet while annotating.  Really, since the inputs are completely independent of each other, there should be a system option to turn off the capacitive input when the stylus is out, so that any application only sees then pen input.\n\nResponsiveness.  You would think that with a quad core processor and all, that the Note would be super responsive.  However, comparing the responsiveness of this tablet to, say, an iPad, the Note falls way short.  It's hard to quantify the difference, but everything just seems a little jerkier and slower on the Note.  This is not a huge deal, but there is a lot of room for improvement here.\n\nThe Screen.  The resolution on this device is very low for a modern tablet, coming in at 1280 x 800, about half the resolution of the newer iPad models.  Maybe I've just been spoiled with my Retina Display laptop and cell phone, but everything on this device appears pixellated.  Things are especially bad for reading.  I probably tend to read a little closer than I should, but small text that I wouldn't have any trouble reading normally all of the sudden becomes difficult on the Note.  The resolution is no deal-breaker, but it does make for a less enjoyable experience.\n\nA Pet Peeve.  Samsung describes this tablet as one for creation, not just consumption.  However, the design choices samsung has made do not seem to reflect this.  For example, the tablet is clearly designed to be used in landscape mode - everything is symmetrical if you look at it in landscape, but asymmetrical in portrait mode.  One big issue with this is that the cord comes out the long side, which is generally also where tablet cases have their hinge.  This means that for many tablet covers, you cannot charge while the case is closed.  For others, you can, but you cannot open/close the case while plugged in.  A Cord coming out the short side would have fixed these problems.\n\nGiven the limit choices for tablets with active digitizer pens, I would recommend this to anyone looking to take notes on a tablet.  However, be prepaired for the annoyances this tablet comes with.  Moreover, if you won't be taking copious notes on this device, I would probably recommend staying away."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I've had experiences with Ipads and other tablets in the past but never purchased one because they have little to no value for productivity. The Note 10.1 is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. This is the only tablet on the market with a Wacom digitizer for incredibly precise handwriting, highlighting etc.\n\nWriting on any other tablet is a joke. I use the Note for annotating PDF slides and making notes. S note can translate handwriting into typed notes and recognize shapes which is very handy. Writing in different colors and importing pics is a snap.\n\nThe one downside of the tablet is that the Wacom tech does not allow it to have the ultra high resolutions of say a Nexus 10 or Ipad, but the screen is still very good. I would trade a few extra pixels for the true ability to write any day. It still manages games and streaming video well.\n\nEvery note also comes with 50GB of dropbox storage for 2yrs. That's a really good value."}

Ps touch is more gimmicky than anything,any real world editing still to be done on desktop.

S Note\n - I can take notes and record lectures at the same time in class\n - I can export my notes to .pdf format and instantly upload the files to Dropbox\n - the \"Shape Match\" feature is useful for drawing lines and graphs\n - the \"Formula Match\" feature is useful for mathematical calculations and visual representation of graphs\n  (collaboration with Wolfram Alpha)\n\n2. Voice typing\n - It is very convenient to voice-type emails and other notes. We can also use this feature for G-talk as well.\n\n3. S voice (like \"Siri\" on iPhone)\n\n4. Voice Search\n - Like Siri on iPhone, we can use this feature to find out the nearest restaurants or gas stations\n\n5. Paper Artist\n - It is fun to play with photos using this feature.\n\nThere are other cool features like Group Play and PS Touch which I haven't had a chance to play with them yet. Samsung's strength lies in its collaboration with other leading companies such as Wacom (S pen), Wolfram Alpha (Formula Match), Adobe (PS Touch) and Dropbox (50 GB storage space for 2 years). It is very smart of Samsung to target the education sector with its productivity features. Now that Steve Jobs was gone, Apple seems to lack imagination and vision, expecting customers to upgrade their iPads on the virtue of \"retina\" display! Give me a break! If Apple doesn't want to lose out to Samsung in the long term, they need to examine what customers expect from a tablet and what they use it for by looking at most popular apps, and come up with creative \"needs\" which the customers themselves are not even aware of yet."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I had owned the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 for about a year, when we saw that Costco had this Note on sale. We decided to make the purchase and haven't been disappointed so far. It still has the basic great features of the Tab, but the added stylus and complementing apps are great. Photoshop touch has been a favorite with the stylus so far! It also makes taking hand written notes much easier, something I think would be a great plus for students. S Note also looks like it would be a great app for students or even people in business.\n\nOne of the biggest differences I've noticed between the Note and the Tab is the load speed. The Note starts up significantly faster than the Tab, I'm talking it's instantly on versus a pretty good wait time on the Tab.\n\nOne thing I would suggest is downloading a keyboard app as the keyboard that comes preloaded isn't the best. I was unable to find a way to get it to auto-correct and was making A LOT of typing mistakes because of the small screen (relative to your typical keyboard). There are many paid options, but I ended up going with the Jellybean keyboard.\n\nAll-in-all, great device, and especially a great option for those who don't want to spend their money on an Apple product!"}

I like the keyboard that has numbers at the top of the screen like a real keyboard so you don't have to toggle between numbers and letters.

I like the fact that you can swipe to other screens in one direction and they revolve around like a carousel so you don't have scroll back when you get to the end like some other devices.

The main layout is the full keyboard with numbers on top like I mentioned above. The second one is a split keyboard so half of the keyboard is on the left side of the screen and the other half is on the right side (iPad does this). The split keyboard allows you to hold the tablet with both hands and type with your thumbs. The third option is a small floating keyboard which can be re-positioned anywhere on the screen. The third option came in handy when the main keyboard was covering up something I needed to see on the screen while keying in something so I was able to move the small keyboard to the top right and get it out of the way."}

When she wasn't using it, I borrowed it and decided I wanted a tablet too, just not an Apple.\n\nWhile the Note is definitely thicker, that's because it fills bigger shoes. The way you touch it is a little different, and I'm still getting used to it. The Note responds to both finger touch and stylus. Sometimes when I need to make a choice, I have to actually push the button, not just touch it, and I'm still getting used to that. I love the wide array of gestures available. And although the camera quality leaves a lot to be desired, it's still miles ahead of the iPad AND! the the outward camera has flash! Even during video! How bout that!\n\nI was actually looking to give my younger son the old iPad and get my daughter a Note, but now I don't think I can do that. The android isn't very autism friendly, at least not to me. The Note, like the iPad, has built-in apps you can't delete, and there's no parental controls to turn off things like web browsing, camera use, or the iPad's Guided Access feature which restricts app use and touchable areas of the screen. If the Note had an option like that, I'd definitely get this for my daughter.\n\nThe S Pen is super sensitive. I love that I can hover above the screen to get tool tip displays. I just wish I could rest my hand on the screen while I draw without accidentally making brushstrokes with the back of my hand. Maybe I can use a glove to fix that, maybe not.\n\nI love that there's so many unlocking options and I love that you can put information about the owner on the lock screen.

I can only speak to what its like after the update, which is what anyone reading this would dealing with anyway.\n-The only other tablet I have owned was the original Kindle Fire.  (However, I am by no means a novice with technology, and I am very aware of the more popular products and their function.)\n\nWith that out of the way, The Samsung Galaxy note 10.1 is everything I was looking for and more.  I had originally just been looking for a cheap way to have my notes taken digitally, as I am a graduate student and cannot tell you how much time I havespent writing, rewriting, and losing notebooks.  Nothing in the \"cheap\" price range came close to what I really wanted from it (a simple tablet like thing I could write on, I wasn't even looking for any other features or a tablet per say.)\n\nI saw the Note 10.1 and it seemed to be too good to be true.  The videos showed it doing everything I wanted.  So, I dove into the \"professional\" reviewers.  As many here can attest (and have), those reviews were often less than glowing.  The screen wasn't good enough for the price, the build was flimsy, the multi tasking was flawed and lacking, and so on.  All these reviews painted a picture of a first generation attempt that needed serious improvement.  So, I kept looking around, hoping to find something else, with better reviews, to fit my needs.  In the course of that search I came across all the forums and customer reviews of the Note 10.1.  The users themselves LOVE the note.  You'll hear the same thing everywhere you look at customer reviews, forget the \"professionals\" this device is amazing, it is what you are looking for, and you won't regret it for a moment.\n\nThe exterior build itself is perhaps the most valid criticism.  There is some give around the back edges and it doesn't feel like a piece of metal you could use as a hammer.  If that's what you're looking for, then I'd suggest just that, you clearly don't want a tablet, you want a hammer.  I keep mine in a flip case, for protection and the stand, while it's in there all those previously mentioned (and VERY minor) details about the build disappear.  It's not flimsy, it's just not an actual rock.\n\nBattery life has been terrific for me.  I use this thing almost non stop every single day.  I will say, I don't watch a ton of video on it, but I do keep on Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, autosync, gps, etc.  I've had almost no need to take any steps to conserve the battery, because it lasts far longer than I've ever needed it to.  The only thing I did do was turn off auto screen brightness and put it at the level I liked, when auto was on, it kept changing the brightness when I didn't want to.  I'd suggest you do the same.\n\nThe screen.  It's well documented that the Note 10.1's screen is \"not as good as\" the other products in the same price range.  That's fair, it isn't \"as good.\"  That also begs the question, how good do you need it to be?  I don't look at my screen and notice any problems.  It's 10 inches.  Larger screens would suffer more from the specs, smaller screens it's almost irrelevant.  Again, how good does your screen need to be?  Are you just buying a tablet as something to watch movies on and you're extremely finicky about it?  Then go elsewhere, this isn't for you.  Here's a better point about the screen, what other tablets in the price range use the Wacom technology, the pressure sensitivity, etc?  How much do people pay for just a Wacom pad?\n\nWhich brings me to the Spen.  The pressure sensitivity.  The ability to hand write on whatever you're working with.  As I student, I have filled up volumes of notes.  I've spent countless hours rewriting work because it needed to be cleaned up for others.  I've filled up notebooks, then the next semester, they are gone and I'm starting over.  I cannot tell you how much time I've spent trying to find notes on some a particular item buried in with everything else.  The Note 10.1 has put an end to that.  My notes are in a file right from the start.  I upload them to dropbox and can get them anywhere I am.  I can email them.  I can reorganize them with the touch of a button.  It's been a life saver, a time saver, and a stress saver.\nYou can even use the S pen to cut and paste parts of the screen to another program.  It's as easy as holding the s pen button and\"circling\" a border around what you want.  I personally use it to grab items like graphs or HW questions from my pdf textbooks and drop them into my notes.\nThe Samsung apps that use the s Pen are all pretty good.  S note is nice, but it has some baffling flaws that almost make it seem like they made it, and then just didn't listen to any user feedback.  Lots of little things that I want to do when note taking (cut and paste (not screen shot), locked zoom, blank template, etc) you simply cannot do in S notes.  so THANK GOD FOR LECTURE NOTES.  Lecture notes is an app, that if you get the Note 10.1, it should be mandatory for you to download.  It's what S notes should be.  Without it, I'd still love my Note, but there would be those minor frustrations.  Lecture Notes does everything you could want and more.  It makes the Note 10.1 indispensable for a student.  I don't know what I'd do without it, and I cringe at the thought of going back to the way it used to be.\n\nI bought the 16gb version.  Apps can only be installed to the built in sd card.  For me, 16gb's there is more than enough.  I have a 32 gb card in the slot where I keep my textbooks, etc.  I don't know how people can use up the systems 16gb with apps.  What the hell are you people installing???\n\nMultitasking, (again, since the update) is great.  I keep open a notebook, and a textbook or powerpoint slides (which you can write directly on, as with pdf's etc) and just click through one while jotting down notes.  You can do it with the video player, youtube, etc as well.  Can you do it with every app?  No, but I do feel that the apps you can do it with cover such a broad range themselves that there really isn't much of anything missing.  And hey, if you want to use one program full screen, switching back and forth between a few things is extremely easy as well.  Even taking a partial screen shot with the pen, it makes it very easy to choose right then and there where you want to take that screen grab in other programs.\n\nI think I've covered everything I intended to, and then some.  Most tablets out there are effectively for passive media consumption.  Sure, you can take pictures, etc, but mostly you're just watching videos, looking at slides, and having access to what has previously been done.  With the Note 10.1 you can actually get things done.  To me, this is what a tablet should be.  It is small, portable, and makes me more productive, not less.\n\nIf that's what you're looking for, then this is what you want.  If you want a device that will allow you to get more done, and keep it all more organized, then here it is.  If you want to just stream videos and take pictures of food, you should go elsewhere, this isn't for you and you wouldn't even know what to do with it.\n\nI don't know when the next generation of this will come along, so I don't know when there will be a new and improved iteration of this, but don't put it off because you want them to work out bugs.  This is a well made machine that will be a productivity aid.  With the addition of the Lecture Notes app, any frustrations have disappeared."}

I had a first gen iPad and when it came time to shop for a new tablet I realized that I could replace it with anything since there wasn't anything Apple specific that I liked about the iPad.  The Note is very nice.  I think the best part was uninstalling iTunes from my PC.  It is so much easier loading photos, songs and ebooks to the tablet and I freed up a ton of space on my computer.  Its also nice having a choice of app stores.  I was primarily using the iPad for Flipboard, Skype and Netflicks and the experience is identical on the Galaxy Note.  The universal remote functionality works very well.  I do not have cable and all of my TVs have very bad channel guides.  It is a very nice replacement.\n\nThe only annoyances I have come across is that in some applications, when the keyboard comes up, there doesnt seem to be a way to make it go away.  It also took a while to find the task manager and its not as good as Apple at killing tasks and preventing things from running.  That is more of a software complaint and not a hardware complaint.  Hopefully it gets better as I customize the device.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with the device and would recommend it to my friends.\n\nOn a side note, when I ordered the tablet, I did not receive it even though the website said it had been delivered.  I later found out I had the wrong zip code on my Amazon profile.  Amazon did an exceptional job to get me a replacement without any hassle."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I was hesitating about buying a Tablet, but after very much research and comparing between the Ipad and Galaxy tablets, I decided for the Note 10.1. I've been using it for meetings and its utility has been marvelous. Besides the business use for emails, calendars, tasks, etc, the stylus is very responsive and there is a bunch of apps that would help you in letting out any artist that may be inside of you. I don't think there is a tablet that can do the things the Galaxy Note 10.1 can do. For that, I think the price is right on this tablet. I have read reviews talking about the screen resolution in comparison with the Ipads Retina and other tablets with higher resolutions. I'm very satisfied with the galaxy Note 10.1 resolution and its capabilities weighted more. It comes with Adobe Photshop Touch, great app. It has an IR transmitter, so you can use it as a remote controller for your TV, Sat or Cable box. Now, I browse the Internet, check emails, control my agenda, view Netflix and HBO Go in my Galaxy Note 10.1. I recommend to anyone looking for a tablet to compare reviews a Youtube videos before buying. Good luck."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Since the are already so many reviews on here for this item I thought I would add a specific angle. One that focuses on the use of the tablet as a graphics design tool mostly.\nI will also spend a moment discussing my other uses for the tablets I own and tell you what my experience is.\n\nBackground you can skip\nI am not necessarily an Apple fan. As a matter of fact, I was always the type of guy building PC's, creating FreeNAS servers, experimenting with software etc. more Microsoft than Apple.\nThe adoption of Apple into my household came when I started to buy computers for my Dad, nephews and nieces and MIL. Due to distance it became aggravating to get the calls where they were stuck with a blue screen or something else after downloading some virus or upgrading some driver. It was always something. So I decided that I would buy a tablet to see if my dad would be able to use that. That was e first Apple device into my home.\nI liked the usability, simplicity of the interface and the Apple-typical lack of buttons. All in all, I was pleased with how fast my 80+ year old dad was able to use it. No reboots, complex downloads or installs etc.\nthen cam iMacs and time machines and MacBooks.\nI found that I spent way less time fixing computers and instead was using them. I was a believer.\nI stuck with the iPads and am currently on the 4th gen. Since iPads are invading my workspace I find myself using it mostly and running into some of the limitations.\n\nHow I use the tablets\nI mostly use my tablet work wise for the development of graphics for presentations that outline complex solutions. We do not use standard PowerPoint stuff but have a philosophy of custom and hand drawn pictures that can, if necessary, be Peter live on a whiteboard.\nSince the ipad does not have any native pressure sensitivity I had to wait until someone came out with a pressure sensitive stylus. At this point there are a few on the market and after looking at reviews I settled for the Jot Not Touch. I mainly use it with Sketchbook Pro, Touchdraw and so on.\nHere are the limitations I have found:\n- the disk tip that is needed for precision on the ipad is still somewhat inaccurate and hard to handle. I often have to press screen buttons multiple times to get it to register.\n- the pressure sensitivity seems to go off and on. Sometimes I find myself pressuring harder and harder to get the same results. This makes for lots of time spent handling the stylus and ipad combo rather than thinking about the quality of my graphics design\n- the styluses for the ipad that have reassure sensitivity either have weird tips or are bulky to handle. I am 5'11\".\n\nI also use the ipad to communicate via iMessage with all my family all over the world. iMessage is so simple and effective and I get it everywhere.without ads and other nonsense.\n\nFinally,and this is quite important once your have the Apple drug in your house: I have connected my home with a series of Airports and time machines. The airports connect to various stereo systems and apple TV's and I can simply control. Everything from my ipad, or my wife from hers.it is supremely easy and connected at a fraction of the cost I would have had if I bought the Sony or Bose solutions for this.\n\nNow about the GN10.1\nI bought it because I was working on another graphics project and got fed up with the clumsy stylus and ipad combo. I even paid overnight rush shipping to get it. And you know what, the Samsung embedded pressure sensitive stylus is so much better than the solution needed with the ipad. The tip is precise, the stylus is the right size, perhaps a little too light and thin but better than what I had for the ipad.\nI have spent less time messing with the hardware and more time on my work, so great kudosto Samsung.\nAlso, the GN is fast, there is nothing to complain about with the 1.4 quad core compared to the ipad.\nThe screen, however, on the ipad, is visibly better when. Drawing thin lines. It doesn't brother me too much since I can simply zoom in and the pixelation disappears but I can't wait for the next GN gen to see if samsung is going to up the ante and increase screen resultion.\n\nI also noted that the battery of the GN seems to notably outlast the ipad battery. My guess is that it outlasts my ipad battery by an extra 30% or so. Maybe because the Bluetooth stylus on the ipad hogs battery? I dunno, but again, Samsung gets it right-er, erer...\n\nSo conclusion: as a graphics tablet solution the Samsung is hands down the winner. Ipad should not even be considered as a mature solution. The retina display is the only redeeming quality.\n\nWhen it comes to messaging etc... It's criminal what junk sits in the Google Play store. Everything seems invested with adware and when you buy versions with no ads you are looking at tons of different solutions... Which nes will your friends be willing to use? Now your friends have to start adding software to message you if you do not make the right pick. Especially when you have your friends and family spread over the globe.\nThat is what I feel is really needed: a native android version of iMessage that works between any and all androids. Bridging into iMessage is not androids responsibility but for crying out loud, I don't want to download and pay for tons of crappy messaging software that does not let me reach my friends and family.  Apple wins.\nI am using Skype on both,  but find myself more on the ipad with iMessage to stay in touch.\n\nFinally, the integration into my household with the airports and stereo links. Luckily my synology audio android software can speak.  Airport, so there is a solution albeit a little bit jerryrigged. This android audio app streams and controls music on any synology diskstation and can feed it into your apple network if need be.  Apple, since they have a vertical solution that you can expand with, is very well integrated. Apple wins.\n\nI love both tablets, am deeply impressed with the Samsung solution since its not a simple copy and steal solution and love the ipad for its simplicity. However, for what I use them for work wise I would part with my ipad and stick with the Samsung given the graphics execution. Apple needs to step up in that area or they will lose out in schools, hospitals etc as the stylus model for note taking comes way more natural than thumbing your comments and notes.\n\nSorry, for the avalanche of words. Hope there is some wisdom in here someone can still use.\n\nPs: the apple soft keyboard is nicer than that on the Samsung BUT the wider screen on the Samsung makes it more convenient and natural. hope Swype makes me a convert."}

I was looking for an android tablet that would help improve my college experience. This tablet has done just that. Samsung started impressing me first with the galaxy note smart phone. Now they have stepped up and offered an amazing tablet with similar but far superior abilities. The s-pen is great for taking notes and the with different apps, ebooks have been a great way to save money. With this product you also get a special app that allows ebooks and pdfs to be written in for taking notes. One of the best physical hardware features is the battery life(it can last over 1 week on stand by and several days with use of 5 hours + each day.)All the features are amazing on this tablet. This tablet would be perfect for any student, business person, or someone who is looking for the best tablet.\nWorth the money? EVERY PENNY!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I had this tablet now for about a week and i am very pleased with it.\n\nThis thing is super fast. It came with Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box. I used it for a couple of hours before noticing that the Jelly Bean update was available. There was a noticeable improvement in responsiveness and speed. Jelly Bean Rocks!!! :)\n\nThe tablet looks and feels very nice. It is considerably lighter than the Ipad 3. I honestly prefer reading books on a 7 inch tablet because they are lighter but when looking at pdf documents this tablet is much better. I decided to put a case on the tablet and it the weight went up quite a bit thought :(\n\nAs far as using the S-Pen and S-Note i can't really complain much. The S-Pen feels like a real pen when you are writing not like those gummy bear stylus tips that the other tablets use to write with. S-Note works pretty well for the most part. The shape match and formula match features are fantastic although they could use a little more refinement. As an engineer student i like the formula match feature a lot since i often have to write down a lot of long formulas. There are times when the program seems to get confused with some of the Greek letters used on the formulas and it can get a bit annoying at times. Like i said, it needs refinement.\n\nThe battery life is one of the first things i look at when buying a portable electronic device. Very pleased so far with its performance. Easily gets me through the day even after taking notes through out the day. I use the brightness at about a quarter and it is enough for me. Don't expect the battery to last the entire day if you have the brightness all the way up while playing HD movies all day. It is just not realistic. If you are indoor web browsing, taking notes, checking e-mail and watching a few videos it should last the entire days with no problems.\n\nThe tablet takes at least 4 hours to charge fully which is a bummer. The cable that comes with the tablet is pathetically short. I don't get why all of the manufacturers insist on giving us this 1 foot long cables to charge the electronics. I guess they don't want to spend a extra 10 cents on a another couple feet of wire. I ended buying a longer cable from Amazon.\n\nI have no problems with the display at all. It is more than adequate for reading and watching movies. The display on the Ipad 3 is better and you can certainly notice the difference when you look at them side buy side. But if you are working with it alone you will see that it is not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.\n\nThe camera is by far one of the weakest things in the tablet. I personally would never use a tablet to take pictures, but if i did, i would be very disappointed. The camera is very, very mediocre. My Samsung Galaxy S3 came out 6 months before and takes much better pictures.\n\nThe speaker's sound quality and the sd card slot for extra storage are big plus.\n\nwith this i want to wrap up my review. If you are a student and are thinking about purchasing a tablet then look no further. This is the ONE. Even if you are not a student i would recommend it. The tablet is not perfect, but then again, nothing in life is."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I absolutely love this tablet. I was a little nervous about it when reading the reviews, but decided to go with it because of the pen and my primary use would be taking notes in class. It took a good full day of using it to really get past those nerves as it did take some time to configure things how I needed them and how best to understand how it works. But I can say now that I would not trade it for anything.\n\nPros:\n- Battery time has been great, lasts a full day of school\n- Multi tasking - I LOVE being able to have multiple apps showing on the screen at the same time, I can have my notes up and ready while at the same time browsing facebook, writing emails browsing the web or texting on google voice. Probably one of the top features of this tablet.\n- The pen - I thought I would only use it for note taking only (which it is absolutely great for and very responsive). But with the 'swype' style keyboard option I can use the stylus to type faster then I can almost type on a computer or write by hand.\n- S-Note - great at organizing my notes by class/chapter. It is also easy to share my notes with other students. I love the different options for color/texture. Also the ability to write an equation and have it converted to a nice text of the equation, as well as auto shapes. I can also take my professors powerpoints or pdfs and import them and make notes directly on them which is great.\n\nCons:\n- S-Note - while it's in my list of pros for its awesome features, I find that it lacks in one major area. You can not select anything that you have already written down so you are unable to move or resize the content. This is a problem when taking notes and you realize you need more room in an area, there is no selecting and moving things around to make it fit. You would have to either erase and rewrite or take a screenshot and then paste it back into the page (quite tedious). This is basically my only gripe and not near enough for me to regret my purchase as I find it so superior to the competition for an in class tablet.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic choice for any student."}

Meetings, home visits etc. I now take my Galaxy Note 10.1 and take all notes on it. As I stated earlier, the writing recognition is perfect, but you can also turn your writing into type print! How awesome is that! Another nice feature for those of us who like to multi task is the feature to be able to split the screen to be able to view two programs at once. This tablet also just received the jellybean update and is lightning fast and runs smooth as butter. I own and have owned numerous tablets. Currently, besides the Note 10.1 I have an Acer Iconia A200 and a Nexus 7 tab. Both are good media consumption tablets; although, they fall short in the productivity department.

They make it hard, for example, to be able to pull up the menu to enlarge your page.  The worst is the keyboard.  When typing the keyboard it is very annoying that the keyboard is far too big for the tablet because it's the entire length of the tablet.  Sure you can split the keyboard or make it smaller; but, when I made it smaller, I had a hard time getting it back to size.

Less costly tablets have USB or HDMI ports for interfacing with projectors, TVs, and such. I think this device is really hamstrung by requiring expensive, proprietary hardware in order to interact with another device.\n\nThat much said, it's filled its purpose as a learning device for our 4-year-old pretty well, since the Android marketplace has a wealth of educational games.\n\nUPDATE: I've come to hate the proprietary plug that powers this tablet. Our 4-year-old watches videos on this and, with the case we have, it's not possible to stand the tablet up for watching while it's plugged in. The cable gets mashed on the bottom of the tablet. I love having tablets and intend to pick up another Android tablet sometime this year. But unless Samsung starts making more pragmatic devices, I'm going to look somewhere else.\n\nIn short - minus one star for only one port. Minus another for that port being for a proprietary power plug. Otherwise it's an excellent Android device."}

Have you???\n\nHope Samsung is reading these reviews cuz i have a few suggestions for the Note line of tablets-\n\n1.  App switching need to be more intuitive, an option to \"swipe from the side definitely '\n\n2.  A little brighter and higher res display sooner than later please!!! Brightness is good compared to other brands but be nice to crank up\n  on super sunny days here in Las Vegas\n\n3.  Couple size options\n\n4.  Coat the plastic casing like Samsung s3 and Note 2 for better scratch  resistance\n\n5.  Tell Google to start developing some better tablet apps\n\nNo better tablet if you need to get this done, period.\n\nSo that's it. i you want to walk around with a television then keep your current tablet.\nIf you need to get anything done get a Samsung Note 10.1 !!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I was comparing the Note 10.1 with the Nexus 10 and iPad. I decided on the Note because of the expandable memory and S Pen technology. This product would have received 5 stars from me if the resolution was up to the Nexus and iPad retina standards. Although it falls short in that department \"in listed specs\" I honestly do not think the resolution is bad at all. In fact, I find that the vivid saturated colors offer deep contrasts that make images \"pop.\" Still pixel density is still PPI no matter what and I'll bet that the next iteration of the Note 10.1 will get a boost in that department. Because, that's the only negative thing you can say about this tablet! It makes up for it in other features where the pros outweigh the cons by a long shot!\n\nWith the new \"project butter\" Jelly Bean OS update, my tablet has improved performance and functionality wise!\n\nOverall, however, I'm happy with my new tablet. Had it since Xmas and I can't put it down.\n\nA couple off things I do recommend though, download Chrome and the Swype keyboard! You have to go to the Swype website in order to download the software. You'll have to disable the setting that doesn't allow apps to be installed outside of the PlayStore. Just re-enable that after installation. Once you get the hang of Swyping (on the small keyboard setting), you'll be typing FAST!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I've had my Galaxy Note 10.1 for about a week in a half now, the packaging was in perfect condition. Yay.\n\nI am a current owner of a Samsung Galaxy SII, and I loved the freedom that Samsung proliferates in their technology and build. I like it so much that i knew immediately when i began searching for a tablet it would be from Samsung. They make some great stuff. I didn't buy the tablet for gaming or even for school since i am currently disabled and have problems learning as well as physically going and coming from school etc. I bought it for legal matters in the hopes that a larger screen would make what i was displaying on it more accurate and applicable, but it seems that it will get more use from entertaining me from heart rendering boredom as i take a long trip to somewhere i don't particularly want to go. but anyways...now for my opinion on the product...:)\n\nIf you are deciding between getting the IPAD or the Samsung note, let me help you out with your decision. GET the Samsung note. Why? you won't miss the IPAD, sure it has a better spec screen but trust me you won't miss it. The Samsung screen is bright and as beautiful as the dickens, trust me. It has this very soft and beautiful luminescence that makes you think \"now there's momma's baby\" when you turn it on. it is not annoyingly strikingly bright (sorry apple). Also i am not biased against apple since i have an IPOD Touch, but come' on apple your stuff is way too expensive to be so consumer limiting. Instead of calling their company apple they should have called it \"Yes, Dad.\" But yes... Buy the 16gb 10.1 note and just buy a 64gb SDHC card and save some money, I even wonder if this will take a 128gb SDHC card (it would be so awesome). knowing Samsung I'm sure it would.\n\nGorilla Glass! Don't leave home without it! I had to walk around with the Note unprotected in my purse (yeah i know i know) where there were house keys and pencils and pennies jiggling free inside for a couple of days and every time i pulled the note out it barely had any dust on it never mind scratches, so i don't advise anyone to buy any screen protection (this coming from a girl who wrapped her computer in glade wrap for fear of cosmetic damages) so that says Alot. Also people say that it messes with the functioning of the stylus, you'll want some smooth swiping for the great applications and games. a screen protector is not needed. but i would and do have a Decal Sticker covering every other exposed part on the note and it now has a little store bought case as well. and yes Samsung built the note with a plastic case but it doesn't look like or feel particularly like plastic, but i like the plastic. it won't dent when it drops to the floor and it also probably wouldn't break either (not because of the plastic but because of Samsung's solid build).\n  Speaking of the Stylus, Super Super Awesome! has a cute little cubby hole, slide out and slide in. the stylus also does not feel awkward in my hands. great for some games but old habits die hard and since i don't use this for writing or reading or anything i'm often using my hands..also because my numb little fingers makes it hard to hold a grip on the stylus.\n  The camera is nice but i doubt people will be using this for the camera, Samsung was just being thoughtful, since most everyone has phones with souped up cameras. When I'm trying to take a picture i go for my Samsung SII instead of my Note. also the note is sorta large to say that you want to take a cute little pic with it. what else...\n  The apps are really nice, again the screen picture quality is really nice so don't worry about the intergalactic level graphics that apple boasts about for the IPAD. you don't need those level of graphics for something so small, it would just be ridiculous and overkill. great bang for your buck. also i must congratulate amazon on getting the product to ME (ME ME ME and nobody else) safely and timely because i have been disappointed over the years. also i advise you to take out warranty, if warranty is there, take it because this can very easily be a laptop replacement and running around the house with it under your arm will be...in short...a mistake.\n- typed over the expanse of 100 hours of speech to text software (kidding...but not really)\n- never really wrote a product review but this product desires some accolades...also i don't feel so scared to be home now :)\n\nProduct Owned: HP Dv6 Touchscreen Laptop (custom made), Psp go (somewhere in the house...wait..no...i think it broke), Ps3 (collecting dust bought it in college tried to get another one for my undeserving brother but never got it. AMAZON!), Samsung Galaxy SII (I love it!), Samsung Galaxy note 10.1 16gb (I love it!), IPOD Touch 3rd generation 64gb ( love it but gonna replace it one day with a Samsung mp3 player)\n\nAge: 21\nSex: Female\nProfession: Certified Pharmacy Technician but became disabled a couple months ago\n\nI hope i was helpful and informative to all the little SAMMIES around the world.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I just bought the Galaxy Note 10.1, because I was unhappy with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 (currently listed for sale on eBay). There are already great, very detailed reviews listed, so I am not going to do the same, but I will tell you why this tablet outdoes the Fire.\n\nTrue Android OS- You get the full Google Play store. The Kindle app store is severely lacking in comparison. Additionally, apps in the Kindle store that worked for the older Fire still are not working on the Fire HD.\n\nWeb Browser- I liked the Fire's Silk browser a lot at first, and then it started closing for no reason at random times. This has not happened once on the Note, and the browser is smooth, and lag free.\n\nSpeakers- The Fire's speakers are nice, but the Note put the speakers on the front of the device which is much much better considering how and why we use speakers on a tablet.\n\nBattery Life- The Note's battery is simply superior.\n\nExpandable Memory- The Note has a microSD slot that can be expanded up to 64 GB, Fire does not.\n\nSplit Screen Option- The Note allows two programs opened side by side simultaneously. For example I can check my email and browse the web at the same time, or browse the web and take (handwritten, thanks to the S Pen) notes at the same time. This is not a capability of the Fire.\n\nSize/Weight- Fire is 20 oz, Note is 21 oz and you get a bigger screen.\n\nKeyboard- Even my smartphone has Swype mastered, and so does the Note, Fire has the WORST keyboard I have ever encountered, period. It is terrible.\n\nI'm sure I will find more things that I like better than the Fire the more I play with the Note. I just hope I can help someone from making the same mistake I did. In a year or so I think the Fire will be greatly improved, but right now it is very glitchy and overall I found the experience disappointing (especially considering my overwhelming love for all things Kindle eReader). The Note 10.1 has me giddy; I like it SO much better!"}

So no i am not an expert that is going to go into extreme detail about all the technical stuff but i do a lot of research on tablets and a lot of technology so yes im an average person but most people that will buy this are probably like me. So here is what i think:\n\nThis tablet is amazing at what it can do! I use it for school so ill try to limit it to that.  I use it mainly for notes which is great because the s pen is so precise and it has a lot of writing options: different colors, different writing utensils, different sizes. It is just great. It is also easy to organize notes because they save it in a format similar to a windows computer (folders, files, etc).  They also have a function to draw perfect shapes, to put in text, and others. But what i think is the coolest is the function one, you tap the icon then write a function and hit search and it will bring up multiscreen with the browser and give you all sorts of information on the function.(derivitaves, graphs, alternate forms, and a lot more). So this brings us up to multiscreen.\n\nThe multiscreen function is also great for school. People aren't very fond of the fact that there is only polaris office, email, gallery, video player, s note and browser to use but don't be so greedy because it is great! You can takes notes on something from the internet very quickly, once i get word documents on it i will use that to take notes, so it really comes in handy.\n\nI also would like to mention that my teachers sometimes give me printed off notes. This is a problem right?.... Nope! Download the app camscanner (its free!!) And you can take a picture of the paper and you can turn it into something that looks like a word document! It isn't perfect but usuable and readable, i truly am amazed by that app.\n\nSomething not school related, the smart remote feature is very very easy to set up and helpful, i won't go too far with it but it is definately a plus! Well there isn't much more i need to talk about because i love everything about it... except it does lag a little bit sometimes which i can deal with but  i know that when i get android 4.2 on it that it will be better so im not worried. And also i am making my friends jealous with this and now they want one (they also say its better than an ipad).\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis is an extremely productive tablet that could be used for school or a business or anything that involves paper and other places that need to be more productive. I highly recommend it to students for its ability to take notes, both given to you and hand written notes. It has an awesome function ability to help with upper level math. Also the smart remote is just one of the many other awesome features. Plus you could get a keyboard and use this to make a word document!"}

First the stylus... precision input is a beautiful feature.  The ability to point to a precise point on the screen smaller than my index finger is a must and once you have it you will never want to give it up (Sorry Apple the stylus is NOT dead).  the handwriting recognition is beast as well.  I can handwrite notes many many times faster than i can type on an onscreen keyboard giving this tablet a distinct advantage when you want to take quick notes of bang out long emails or reviews ;-).  then the ability to free write in SNote allows you to use shorthand, pictures and all manner of pictograms just like you are writing on a piece of paper.  Lastly the multiwindow capabilities are very welcome.  it is really nice to be able to scroll through a webpage or the bible in the left pane while taking handwritten notes in the right pane.  These key differentiators plus the power of a 1.4 Ghz Quad Core and 2 GB of RAM deciding to buy this tablet is a no brainer!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I tried a lot of tablets in the Amazon showroom (BB) and read a lot of reviews.  I almost bought the Nexus 10 to get the native Android experience, but I couldn't commit to a tablet that didn't have an expansion slot.  I manage and store all my media on an SD card so I'm not tethered to the cloud.  Storage expansion is a \"must-have\" feature.  I was concerned about the standard resolution of the Note screen, but the screen looks great.  Because the screen is a standard resolution, there are fewer pixels to push around (compared to the Nexus 10) which makes for a super smooth user experience.  It never lags, stutters or hangs and I'm using it with a live wallpaper.  The other consideration is the number of Android tablet apps.  While there are a lot good tablet apps, most aren't written to take advantage of a high resolution screen like the Nexus.  And the screen is bright.  I lowered it to 40% and it's still very bright for indoor use.\n\nThe Note is used mostly for media consumption, casual games, email and surfing...and I'm doing all this while \"watching\" TV.  The Peel IR remote feature is excellent and well implemented.  Since I'm multitasking, changing the channels is easy using the tablet.  I can search the guide, find a program, select the icon and the cable box responds and brings me my program.  Audio sounds great...for a tablet.  Having the speakers facing front is brilliant, if not common sense.\n\nI've only experimented with the S-pen a little bit and it works fine, even converting my poor handwriting to editable text, although I don't know how much I'll use it.  The S-pen would be great for business people or if you're an artist, I'm neither.  I purchased a slim leather case that fits perfect and provides basic protection for the tablet.\n\nCheck out the Note.  It's buttery smooth, great screen, IR remote, and expandable storage, everything I need."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "*edited note*: For some reason, my customer image for a sample sketch isn't showing up for this product.  You can see the quick study I did of \"Flaming June\" by Leighton on my user profile as my user photo (Sketchbook Pro app was used)\n\nI've been looking for a tablet to use while away from my desktop machine for sketching and jotting down ideas.  I've been carrying around a sketchbook and pencil forever, but it's frustrating to only be able to work in shades of gray (who wants to cart around a case of colored pencils or pastels to all places?) as well as having to scan and re-touch the scans of any sketches I make.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is what I ended up upgrading from a Nook Color.  It's fantastic!  Wacom penabled, the S Pen has \"good enough\" pressure sensitivity (probably on par with a Bamboo based on my own subjective feel/use) and is also great for note taking.  While S Note does a good job of OCRing handwritten text, I actually prefer saving documents in my own handwriting + diagrams.  No more struggling with a laptop to take notes especially when you REALLY want to circle, underline, change the color of, or otherwise add arrows, stars, hearts etc to your writing.\n\nIs it as good as the latest Wacom Intuos tablet?  Of course not.  You could buy a large version of one of those for the same price as this tablet.  But it *is good enough* for a daily-driver for sketching/doodling or even retouching images you've created on your desktop+wacom intuos combo.  I've done sketches on this tablet that I've synced to my desktop to finish up there at my leisure.\n\nI have not run into any lag issues (where the line you are drawing takes a while to render, or doesn't render correctly because the cpu is chugging to keep up) using Sketchbook Pro and LayerPaint, but I also do not make big sweeping motions on this tablet as I do on my Wacom large tablet + desktop.  You may notice a little lag with *very* large brush sizes.\n\nThe S Pen comes with a nib remover (metal circle) and extra nibs (default rubber tips + hard plastic white nibs).  I would recommend using the rubber nibbed for better traction if you're using a naked screen.  With a clear screen protector, I prefer the plastic nibs for next-to-no drag.  People who prefer a texture more similar to paper when writing or drawing may want to apply a matte screen protector.\n\nPeople can quibble about the (relatively) low resolution of the 10.1\" screen (1280x800) not being as high as other HD+ tablets.  Yes, you will notice the lower ppi if you look closely (~ half a foot away) at small text, but unless you're into pixel-peeping 90% of the time, you won't notice.  Colors are bright, text is crisp when viewed like you would normally, and 720p (HD) videos look fantastic.  Sure, you won't get the super-high 1080p clarity you might get with a different higher-res tablet, but who wants to waste SD card space on a video twice the size for a display that's not even close to a desktop monitor in size?  Save the 1080p videos for your large widescreen tvs.\n\nPlays MKVs natively, which is nice -- no more converting to mp4 because the default player supports container-type formats.\n\nThe twin speakers are okay. The stereo effect works well (e.g., the old \"car moving from one end of the screen to the other\" surround-sound effect) but the volume could be louder --- at max, there can be some distortion and you'd have a hard time hearing people speaking clearly at anything lower than mid-volume with any normal ambient noise in the room.\n\nBuild-wise, mine looks pretty sturdy.  I can hear a little creaking in certain parts of the back when pressed firmly on, which is not entirely unexpected since it's plastic.  Thinner and lighter than my old iPad 2, I prefer keeping it in a case to avoid any issues with dropping/dinging it.\n\nIn terms of peripherals - You can use up to a 64GB micro SD card with this tablet, which is one of the reasons I went with the 16GB instead of 32GB version (check the price difference between the extra GB edition vs microSD pricing).  Not very much yet out there in terms of other accessories, Samsung's previewed a keyboard dock, OTG hub (so you can plug in USB keyboards etc) and a slim magnetic case but it's hard to find them in stock.\n\nWith regards to using a case, I heard people having issues with strong magnets affecting S pen tracking, so I would recommend not using a magnetic case if you're very particular about how the S Pen functions (e.g., wanting to do a lot of fine detailed digital work)\n\nIn terms of negatives, mostly software-related:\n\n- Samsung's proprietary UI and apps.  Android OS fragmentation aside, I was eyeballing the Nexus 10 before purchasing the Note because I hate most android mods.  This one is no exception.  You cannot delete any apps that come with the tablet unless you decide to root the tablet.  Rooting the tablet, aside from the obvious warranty implications, can also affect DRM-sensing apps from working properly.  I really wish Samsung would let its users decide on whether or not they want apps like Crayon Physics, S Suggest, and Dropbox to remain on their tablet.\n\n- Apps can only install on default memory*.  You cannot use Apps2SD, for example, to move apps from the Note's built-in memory to an external SD card without *rooting the device.  While you get 16GB, this can get annoying if you are an app glutton (especially with app waistlines expanding to upwards of 50MB per app or more) or use apps that don't give you the option of saving files to the external SD card.\n\n- Proprietary 30-pin cable and non-removable battery.  The first is annoying but you can buy $6 cables on Amazon as extras (the one that comes with the charging hub is *extremely* short, ~3 feet at most) that work just fine.  If you attempt to charge this tablet via your computer, the tablet will show the battery icon as not charging.  In some cases (depending on the amount of juice it gets from the USB port) it will actually charge, but so slowly that it's practically useless.  The non-removable battery is annoying simply because batteries for these mobile devices just don't last more than a couple of years before losing charging capacity.\n\n- Slow OS updating.  Samsung has rolled out Jellybean (which is, from my experience on a rooted Nook Color, a massive upgrade in terms of responsiveness and general UI improvement over Ice Cream Sandwich) updates to other regions but has yet to update US/Canada versions of this tablet (N8013 model).  Not a big issue since the tablet is very responsive even while multi-windowing, but if you absolutely have to have Jellybean the only way to get it on a US model Note right now is by rooting/romming it.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWould I have bought this tablet if I didn't need/want the Wacom penabled S Pen?  Probably not, since other tablets out there have nicer screens (ipad with retina display, nexus 10 with high ppi also).  The Nexus 10 was next on my list because of the nice screen plus un-modified Android UI/OS/more regular updates.  I use a moderate selection of apps and am a light tablet gamer.  This has handled 3D games beautifully (see any youtube reviews) because of the powerful processor. I also read a lot, and while the 10.1\" format is a bit clunky for e-reading compared to my 7\" Nook Color (the large size makes it more awkward to hold even though it's actually lighter), it's adequate for the purpose.\n\nHowever, that's the beauty of android tablets -- there's sizes and types for everyone.  I would not, for example, recommend the same tablet for my mom as I would for myself --- it depends on how you want to use it.  Would you buy a Porsche for delivering newspapers?  The same basic idea goes for tablets.\n\nFor digital art work, there's currently nothing on the market right now that can match this without additional purchases (e.g. the Adonit Jot BT pen for iPad).  When the Surface Pro comes out, those who want full-fledged applications such as Photoshop may want to go that route, but they'll sacrifice for the power with a much smaller battery life.\n\n As far as iOS vs. Android, it's your own very personal platform preference -- apples to oranges and I would highly recommend trying out both types of tablets at your local brick-and-mortar if you can't decide which type to get."}

What sold me was the unique feature of the Galaxy Note: the writing stylus. It's not just any stylus, but an actual wacom-style digitizer, enabling pressure sensitivity. That kind of detail is the difference between sketching with a pencil and a ballpoint pen. I'm no artist, but it lets the software read your handwriting better than any other device. If you're sick of typing and want to just take notes, go to a brick&mortar store and give this tablet a whirl."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I use a laptop or (previously) an iPad in the field to review and edit numerous technical documents.  The iPad eventually took the place of the laptop due to ease of use and portability........well move over iPad.  I bought the Note after reading the many reviews here.  I bought it based on the reviews, the fact that I prefer the flexibility of the Android system, and the S pen technology.  I planned to take an iPad and the Note on a business trip that was going to involve a lot of PDF review and note taking.  I got the Note a week before the trip and within a few days decided the iPad could stay home.\n\nNot going to rehash all the details that so many previous reviewers spent a ton of time detailing (THANKS), let me just say that I use this more and more every day.  I used to take the iPad in the field with me on average 3-4 times a week.  The Note goes with me every time I'm out the door.  The iPad is nice, don't get me wrong.  This just works much better for me in a business environment.\n\nThe S pen takes a bit of getting used to but I find it becoming more and more instinctive to use.  Being a \"paper challenged\" person it it is great to have all my notes where I need them.  This device replaces the 3-4 spiral notebooks I used to carry in the field.\n\nThe camera is fine for my usage needs, I am using it much more than the one on my phone and it is proving a valuable tool for enhancing field notes.\n\nAll my Android apps from my phone work and installed automatically within a minute or so of activation.\n\nBattery life is comparable to my iPad.  The only downside is I have yet to find a really good protective case for the Note.  I'm sure time will cure that issue."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "My background is I'm on my desktop PC running WinXP and had a old low-end laptop which I no longer have, but had enjoyed the portability with. I got this tablet because I'm an amateur artist and I wanted to get a device that was good to draw on as well as had basic laptop functionality to replace my old one so I'm not as tied to my PC. I do not own any Apple or Android products, so I wasn't tied to either company. This made me favor the Android system, because it was more open.\n\nI did a LOT of research on tablets to see what fit my needs best, and I know there are even others that are more like a laptop, with a detachable keyboard, like the Transformer series. This one was as much as I wanted to spend, most of the others that were attractive were also higher-priced (for good reason). Ones like the Surface Pro, while really cool, were out of my price range. The other one I was more seriously looking at was the Nexus 10, but I wanted the better pen experience over the better resolution.\n\nOne thing I want to make clear about the S-pen is this is the ONLY tablet that currently uses Wacom technology, which is the best for artistic work. Other tablets support a stylus, but they all have a rounded rubber end or a clear plastic disc around the point if it is fine, because the touch technology works differently for those tablets. No other tablet has ACTUAL pressure sensitivity and a normal style of pen.\nHowever, the unfortunate drawback of it being an Android tablet is that iPad actually has a couple superb art apps that are not available for Android, which I find ironic :( But that doesn't mean we don't get good apps. The tablet comes with Adobe Touch, but frankly I don't think its the best one, even though its the most expensive on the app store normally. Adobe has sadly pretty much pulled out of the Android market altogether save for this app, and I wouldn't be surprised if it never sees a real update of new features. I feel a lot of bitterness towards Adobe for this. I was going to pick up Ideas even though I knew it was really limited, but it got pulled from the market before I got my tablet. The main reasons I don't recommend Touch are severe limitations in file saving and opening. Other apps can give you .psd support, layers, and S-pen support without as much hassle. Adobe only lets you save files on their Cloud.\nThe most recommended art apps are Sketchbook Pro and Layer Paint which I think weren't more than $3 each. They both seem solid and highly-reviewed but I havn't used them enough to offer a real opinion yet. There are of course a bunch of others, I grabbed ZenBrush to try it out since it was free. I was looking for something that supported layers and I could export to continue to work with in Photoshop CS on my desktop and those two seem to fit the bill.\n\nNow that I've got that out of the way, I have to say I love this tablet. I feel like every day it blows my mind how cool it is :D It has replaced everything I can do on my desktop PC save for extensive programs like full Photoshop or large games like Guild Wars 2. Web browsing, art files, documents, light games, music, videos, it does it all. This tablet is great on its own for regular functions, but having the S-pen makes it amazing.\nI'm looking forward to the Jelly Bean update, because I think this tablet will keep getting better. (The reason Jelly Bean takes longer for this than a Nexus is Samsung does tweaking for support of the S-pen and some other modifications, but it should be hitting really soon.)\nI honestly hope Samsung keeps this line of tablets going in the future, and while I am happy with how this tablet is, I see some ways they could continue to improve. I look forward to a Note 2 when the time comes, though I don't think it will be soon. I also hope more apps will continue to appear to support the S-pen.\n\nSo, here's a rundown of some features:\n\nI love that it had a micro SD expansion slot. The main thing I didn't like about the Nexus was the lack of memory expansion. This tablet has ample space for my needs after getting a micro SD card. I plugged the tablet into the computer and was able to move my files onto the tablet card as easy as moving them to a flash drive. It just can take a while for a large volume of files. I was able to move over my music, video files, and other docs I wanted access to and still have a good amount of space left.\nI also already use Dropbox and love it. I already had some extra space unlocked, but getting the huge chunk of free space for 2 years is awesome. This is great for files you want to be able to work on with several devices.\n\nI love how customize-able the screens are. I can make whatever mix of widgets and app icons wherever I want (you have 6 full screens you can lay out and swipe between, so I made themed ones- email, news, calendar, games, internet apps, and music/videos). I trashed most of the default layout pretty quickly. Some of the side bars from Samsung aren't that useful, but I just tweak or ignore them and they don't get in my way.\n\nSo far I've had no problems with the tablet's performance- no crashing or hanging or anything. It runs smoothly and quickly.\n\nIt finds and connects to wifi easily. Most settings are very quick to access and modify. It also supports Bluetooth.\n\nI was very impressed with the battery life. It generally lasts 2 days of pretty heavy use- I've never run out so far. I generally charge it every other day, though other electronics (like my phone) I charge every night.\n\nThe resolution may not be top of the line, but it looks great to me. I enjoy watching video files (which is supports a god range of) as well as apps like Netflix and Crunchy Roll.\nPolaris Office comes included and can handle Microsoft documents, so I was able to open whatever I needed! It also supports Adobe Reader for .pdfs.\n\nThe speakers are good, but I also love that it has a headphone port. I sometimes plug in some computer speakers and listen to music at work through it. The music stays on in the background if you're doing something else with the tablet.\n\nI figured out most stuff with the tablet quickly just by poking around, although Samsung for the most part tells you very little other than a brief feature overview booklet. But hey that's what Google is for. I generally just looked up any questions I had. I'd say only folks who aren't comfortable on computers may have some trouble diving in. I found it logical for the most part.\n\nThe app selection seems very good. You can always browse the Google Play store before buying the tablet to see if what you want is there (although not all apps are supported by all devices- I learned sadly the Popcap games there are not supported for this tablet). It also supports Nook and Kindle (and I'm sure others) so you can shop at other app stores too for your games, music, movies, books, etc, you are not tied just to Google.\nI think this tablet is a great size for reading, I generally tilt it sideways for browsing the web or reading. It just takes the tablet a second to orient in any direction.\n\nI've seen some people complain that the side-by-side feature for running a few select programs is kind of lackluster, and they have a valid point, but I didn't really mind. I read how the feature worked, but it wasn't something I really planning on using much. If this is a reason you're buying this tablet, keep in mind its limited to a handful of programs, and it does take a moment when switching for that program to activate. Its still a good feature if you don't have super high expectations.\n\nThe camera is adequate, but unimpressive. It seems required for any portable device to have a camera nowadays, and both front and back are there, but the photos aren't great. If I'm taking serious pictures, I'll stick to the digital camera I got. Its about equally as good as a normal cell phone for just taking a quick pic you want to post to Twitter. It has the weaknesses of most regular range digital cameras with low light, indoors, and motion. It does do video too and I can see it being good if you want to video chat on Skype or something. It gets the job done, its just not going to make amazing vacation photos.\n\nI believe you can get a Samsung or bluetooth keyboard for this separately, so you can get more of a laptop feel. I am a avid typer (can you tell by the length of my article?), but for typing I was satisfied with using the touch screen. I'd say you probably only need a keyboard attachment if you plan on typing a LOT, for instance writing a book or something and don't want to use the pen.\n\nOne thing that's been a concern with tablets is the lack of support for Flash. With the number of websites and such that use Flash, I thought it'd be a problem, but so far I havn't even noticed. Most extensive Flash or video sites (like Youtube) have an app to use instead.\n\nI'm currently waiting on a case to come- I'd like to keep it in my purse/bag, and while it seems solidly built, I don't want to worry about it rubbing against other things like my keys and getting scratched. I had a hard time deciding on a case, hopefully I picked a good one. I like that some of the cases offer folding options to function as a stand for your tablet, so I think a case is a good addition if you can find one you like. Be aware some do not have a slot cut for the pen!\n\nMy nitpicks about the tablet would be that its a little heavy to hold freehand over a period of time to read, watch video, or whatnot, but I don't have a problem resting it on my legs or something else. It doesn't get hot like a laptop at all.\nI also don't feel like the charger fits in the bottom well- it doesn't really click in, you just kinda wiggle and push it in and out. Over time I'm afraid it may have a tendency to get loose.\n\nWould I recommend this tablet for everyone? Not universally. You are paying extra for the Wacom screen technology and also sacrificing some resolution, so if you're not in love with the S-pen, then I'd look at other tablets. I don't think this tablet is for your average person who mostly wants some media and internet consumption- there are better tablets if the pen doesn't matter to you.\nFor a purchase like this, I recommend you do what I did- find a local store that has one on display to try. I went to Best Buy several times to poke at this tablet before deciding to buy. I also went to several office stores to try out other tablets. Poke around in S-note, see how you like the feel of the pen (though be aware it may have been abused and not work as well as it should.)\n\nShould you get the 16GB or 32GB internal memory? I did some reading and decided on the 16GB since the tablet has space for ample expansion, and you can get a far larger micro SD card for the $50 difference- I got the 64GB SanDisk class 10 one. I popped it in the small port not long after I got the tablet going for the first time and it recognized it no problem. 16+64= 80GB which is likely far more than I'll ever need. The only thing to be aware of is some things will only work or want to go on the internal memory, and like any storage drive, the number is a lie. You actually start with more like 11.6GB free space after the OS and whatnot, and 59.5GB on the card (I'm not sure why about that, I think it may have come with stuff on it). After getting any app that sounded interesting and filling up a chunk of my card with a large part of my music collection and videos, I'm at 9.3GB free on the system, and 30.2GB on my card, so I don't feel like I'm in any danger of running out of either.\n\nI've had it a couple weeks at this point so not really had time to test out all the details extensively, so I'll update this review later on."}

Although it's no iPad, it's perfect for my needs, and offers lots of features the iPad doesn't.\n\nI was shopping for a solution that could allow me to:\nDraw\nTake notes\nBrowse the net and consume media\nTake pictures and edit them and draw on them\nEasily sync to the cloud to share with my laptop\n\nThis does all of those things, and the included pressure-sensitive Wacom stylus and digitizer make drawing and note-taking a pleasure instead of a pain. The experience is very similar to that on tablet PC, but this tablet is much more portable, lighter, less expensive, and lasts for hours and hours on a single charge, unlike my tablet PC which lasts 2-4 hours max.\n\nIf you're looking for a pleasurable drawing and writing experience, and don't need to run Windows software, this is probably the tablet for you. You just have to make sure to explore all the apps available and choose the one you like best. Fortunately they're all $5 or less so it's not expensive to explore.\n\nIf you're interested, here's the apps I use on this tablet:\n\nFor note-taking and doodling:\nLectureNotes: it's got tons of settings you can adjust for just the right experience, and it can sync to any cloud drive or Evernote\nor S-Note for its integration into the OS and ability to easily sync to Google or Evernote, although its proprietary .snb file format makes it impossible to collaborate with non-Samsung devices\n\nFor drawing in earnest:\nSketchbook Pro, although this app is annoying because it forces you to hold the tablet in landscape format, which is the opposite of what a real sketchbook offers. Sketchbook Mobile lets you draw in portrait mode but has fewer features.\nor Photoshop Touch, although this has the same landscape-only irritation, and it's especially bad because it forces you to hold the tablet in only ONE position, which is upside down to how I'd like to hold it. On the other hand, it's got great image-manipulation tools which makes it easier to integrate photos and such into drawings.\n\nAll in all, a good investment for the price, and as more apps become available for stylus use, the experience should just keep improving."}

There is no lagging or glitching as I am used to with Android products and Samsung has out done themselves with their overlay.\n\nMy only caution is that you should get a portfolio for the tablet as, is the case with most electronics anymore, it isn't made of steel. That is to say it seems fragile enough to me that it won't break at a small drop but that you still want to be careful with it.\n\nThe camera is not the best for normal indoor lowlight situations, but turn up the lights and it works great. Be careful of the auto brightness option as it gets a little dark for me and strains my eyes some tryign to read with the brightness so low. Easy to fix though because you can adjust the brightness with ease.\n\nBuilt in programs are awesome, period.\n\nI couldn't ask for more."}

As far as I can tell there is no where to turn off pinch zooming.  Sometimes my wrist will cause this feature to activate when it is rested on the corner of the screen (I have palm resistance on).  Hopefully this will be updated whenever they plan on releasing Jelly Bean.\n\nJelly Bean is really what I am waiting for.  I like the idea of a calendar I can write on.\n\nBesides what I just mentioned, this is my first tablet and I really like it thus far."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "There are a million specs with tablets these days, but I got this tablet because Samsung made it sound like the pen would be the \"killer app\" feature.  You can use it to write wherever you can use the keyboard, but it's very inaccurate and erases your text as you go making it impossible to see the full word you type.  The note application has special features like shapes and formulas, but all are just for appearance.  The formulas don't work and the shapes don't have any particular dimension.  I hoped I might be able to type formulas direct into the spreadsheet app, but you have to constantly click the formula bar, type, and click it again.  The integration with the pen in most apps is poor at best.  The only benefit to this device per the pen might be the pressure sensitivity, but that hardly seems worth building a tablet around.  The pen also feels cheap.  This idea has potential, but this attempt is amateur hour."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I purchased the first galaxy tab when it was released over a year ago and was pretty happy with my purchase.  Was it the end all be all, no but it left not much to complain about.  This holiday season I had the opportunity to upgrade and holy smokes, let me tell you what a great idea it was.  This tablet is sexy and sleek.  The motions are so fluid and I haven't even received the new software update which is suppose to make it even more smoother.  The S Pen is very impressive.  Its lightweight with a small rounded tip that gives you crazy precision. The S Pen tucks away into the bottom right corner of the tablet and it was designed so carefully, you can barely tell it is even supposed to come out. It is by far the most precise pen/stylus I have used so far.  Very happy with that.  It also has a ton of new features I haven't even begun to unravel but the Photoshop Touch app was done smartly and I see myself getting a lot of use out of it.  One of the biggest bonuses is Micro SD slot allows me to never have to worry about running out of space again.  How sweet it is.  Oh I must say that the multiscreen feature was what I had been waiting for from a productivity standpoint for a long time and it delivered pretty well.  Its a little buggy when using Polaris Office and the web browser.  It continues to crash on me but all the other multiscreens work great.  S Note and S Planner are reasons to by the tablet by itself.  Talk about a seriously thought out integration of note taking with calendar planning and synchronization.  I have been able to sync my work, home and Google up with no problem at all.  Seeing everything in one place and to be able to jot notes and retrieve them when I need them, it has completely eliminated EverNote for me.\n\nAll in all, I think Samsung really out did themselves and this a pretty darn good product.  If you are considering this product, head over to:  [...].  Its a guide to help you get familiar with the tablet and was very informative.\n\nThe only reason this didn't receive 5 Stars from me is that I have yet to see an absolutely perfect gadget produced for the masses.  However this one comes pretty close.  If you buy this tablet, you will love it!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I've been using an iPad 2 for the past couple of years and have thoroughly enjoyed that.  No iPad bashing from me.  I've also been spending a bit of time on an Asus Vivo Tab RT, which is really a terrific tablet as well.  And I've been playing a bit with a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.0 7\" and a Kindle Fire HD 7\".  I love different things about all of these and believe they all have a place.  However, the device I am most likely to pick up first is the Samsung Note 10.1.  There is no doubt that lower resolution on this tablet is a slight disappointment, but this is really only an issue if you are heavily accustomed to working on a full HD+ tablet (iPad with Retina display, Nexus 10, etc.).\n\nPros:\n* Light (feels much lighter than my iPad 2), making it much more enjoyable to use\n* Gorgeous screen - bright with vivid colors\n* microSD card slot - a huge advantage over the iPad or Nexus 7\n* Fast - great quad-core processor offering speedy performance\n* Multitasking - this is limited, but is an awesome feature that no other Android tablets, or iPads, offer (Win 8 RT tablets like my Asus Vivo Tab RT offer very, very limited multitasking)\n* Speakers - clear, reasonably strong, and very well placed\n* Buttons - easy to use, very responsive (would be nice if the volume & power buttons were further separated, but this is similar to most other tablets, and you get used to it.\n* Keyboard - There are few keyboard configurations. I'm currently using the split keyboard which makes for quick & easy 2-handed typing.  I find the keyboard designs on the Note 10.1 to be much better than the iPad and Windows 8 tablets.\n* IR-blaster with Smart Remote app - not a critical feature, but the ability to use the tablet as a remote makes it all the more useful\n* S Pen - this, of course, is the most distinctive feature of the Note 10.1.  Sure you can use a stylus on other tablets, but this pen/tablet combo is pressure-sensitive and takes the tablet computing experience to a new level. For business/productivity as well as art & photography, this is a fantastic feature.\n\nCons:\n* Price - there is a huge jump in price from the 10\" Tab to the 10\" Note 10.1.  You are paying a premium for a better processor and the S Pen.  These features justify the higher price, but if you don't need them, look at the 10\" Tab.\n* Low-res screen - given the cost, it is definitely disappointing that Samsung didn't offer a better screen on the Note 10.1.\n* No Jelly Bean upgrade as of Dec 30, 2012 (released in Germany on Dec 12, so there is hope, but it is disappointing that the upgrades don't come faster - though this is true of other Android tablets).\n\nThis is not a perfect tablet, but then again, one doesn't exist yet.  A full HD screen would make this pretty close. If you're debating between this and an iPad, I think this is a clear winner unless you have a specific need for the iPad's breathtaking Retina display.  The S Pen makes it much more usable, the microSD slot allows you to expand the storage, and the price (currently as low as $399) are all benefits over the iPad.\n\nIf you can afford the added expense of the Note 10.1 over the 10\" Tab, then this is a fantastic deal.  I give it 5 starts not b/c it is perfect, but because it is a solid tablet that works well and offers an unbeatable combination of features.  Having said all of this, think about your needs.  Note that if you are considering a 7\" form factor, the Samsung Galaxy 7.7 is clearly the best tablet of its size on the market (hard to find, but Verizon is offering it for just $399 right now with 4G/LTE (no contract needed).  Or wait a little while longer as there are credible rumors that a 7\" Note is in the works.  That will presumably offer a display comparable to the Galaxy 7.7 but with the benefits of the Note line.  I find it easy to justify having both 7\" and 10\" tablets, but if I had to pick just one, I might opt for the Galaxy 7.7 (now - until the rumored 7\" Note appears)."}

There are many excellent detailed reviews already on Amazon, so I will just hit a few key points.\n\nThe screen is very bright and vibrant - watching Netflix on this device is a joy.  If you are concerned about the lower (than other tablets) screen resolution, don't.  It's only a 10\" screen, how many pixels do we really need - movies, games, etc all look great. This device is very zippy and web pages load quickly. The s pen and multiscreen functionality are neat features not included with other tablets. The pen is fun to play around with, but I haven't spent a lot of time with it yet. The multiscreen has limited aps that use the feature, but it's nice to be able to read email while surfing the web or watching a video.\n\nBottom line - I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this tablet."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I recently bought this tablet for my birthday. I had grand visions of using it to replace pen and paper/printouts for my university classes. It's definitely lacking in functionality that a student and even an average person would need in order to operate the tablet well. For example, converting .pdf files into the s-note application takes about 10 seconds per page. If you are converting a large file in order to write on it (say a .pdf deck of slides for class), then S-note takes 10-20 minutes easily just so you can use the fabled s-pen in an efficient way (not many apps take advantage of palm rejection, have smoothing, etc, only S-note does)\n\nIn my opinion (as an owner), poor functionality as anything other than a notepad/sketchpad (aka difficult to write on lecture slides, word docs, etc.) leads to a tablet that should have been, but isn't, great. There you go folks. Go buy something else!\n\nEDIT: The Note actually charges using more power than micro-USB provides. So it does seem reasonable to have a proprietary charger. I've edited the review and added a star accordingly.\n\nEDIT 2: The major problem with the Note now is that when you write in S-note with the palm on the screen, it thinks you are trying to resize the screen. So while palm reject effectively works, the resizing the screen problem is an extreme annoyance that happens every time you lift your palm to move down a line (which is often because the Note's screen isn't nearly as wide as a sheet of paper). Also, if you are writing on a flat surface (Which most of us are), your arm will hit the menu which will pop up again, when you move your palm. It's easy to close and resize, but after doing it a million times, you'd rather just use paper and scan it in. Serious design flaw that many users are having. Curious if anyone has found a fix for this issue.\n\nEDIT 3: LectureNotes by Acadoid does what S-note is supposed to do for students. Highly recommended, it will make the Note 10.1 functional enough to take high-quality notes in certain classes."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I bought the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 because I wanted something for:\n- Taking notes\n- Reading science papers. I hate printing papers in black and white only to have to go back online to look at colored figures. I also wanted to be able to write notes or make annotations in the margins or on the figures. I wanted to be able to keep all these papers organized in one place instead of carrying a stack wherever I went.\n\nI am someone who learns best by physically writing/drawing things; I don't retain as much when I type notes or take pictures of diagrams. I specifically bought the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 because it came with S Pen.\n\nBest Apps for my Purposes:\nSNote - For taking notes during chalktalks and classes, and brainstorming.\nAdobe PDF - For taking notes on powerpoints.\nEZPDF - Costs $ but better for writing in the margins, highlighting, underlining than Adobe PDF. You can also write smaller in the margins (can't change the pen thickness for Adobe PDF after a certain point).\nKingsoft Office/OfficeSuite - Polaris has \"not saved\" my work a couple of times even after I've clicked \"Save.\" You can see other reviews about the Polaris Bug here [...]. I'm not sure if it's still a problem, but it's the reason I have started using Kingsoft Office (which is free) as well as OfficeSuite (which costs $). I've bought a Bluetooth keyboard (from Logitech http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-920-003390-Tablet-Keyboard-Android/dp/B0054L8N7M).

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I had been using the  Thinkpad tablet by Lenovo.  The key feature for me is the stylus - Thinkpad also has one - so that I can take digital handwritten notes for my numerous meetings, tasks, thoughts, ideas, etc.  Thinkpad did all of this for me and I liked Thinkpad quite a bit, but it had a few problems: a) the battery life was terrible, especially since the android upgrade to jelly bean, b) it took way too long to recharge, c) it was a bit on the big side of the tablet market.  The Galaxy Note 10.1 is everything that Thinkpad could do vis-&agrave;-vis stylus handwriting with outstanding battery life, fairly quick recharge, and in a slim, stylish package. I find the Samsung S-Note application to be very good and on par with the Quill application I had been using on my Thinkpad - I could go back to  Quill anytime but I find the S-Note's ability to organize notes using subfolders to be superior to Quill's.  Multi-task screens are an important breakthrough.  I enjoy using Polaris office (pre-packaged on my Note) side-by-side with S-Note, or with the Internet browser.  I wish that the Note could place any application in multi-task mode (side-by-side on one screen), but it only works with some of the built-in applications.  I also wish it was easy to set another application as the default, but even though I prefer Dolphin browser and have set it as default, I always get asked which browser I want to use for certain system tasks...annoying. The pluses outweigh these minuses by about 10 to 1 and this table is my companion at work and at home.  A truly great innovation by Samsung."}

I own an original ipad, a Sony xperia, a Kindle 7\" and a Kindle 8.9\" and now the Galaxy note.  This by far is my favorite product. The ipad is boring to use, the xperia is a little bit better and the kindles are excellent for Amazon consumption and not alot more. The note can do so much more then all these products put together, and it's going to only get alot better once the jellybean operating system is released for the U.S.. Alot has been made about the screen not being a retina display, however the display pops with color and contrast that it looks better then the kindles higher rated resoloutions. The Galaxy has three viewing options, dynamic, normal, and movie, I prefer the dynamic but all 3 look excellent. Again I was at first very inpressed with the Kindles speakers, very loud and clear, however the Galaxy note has excellent speakers that deliver clear stereo or even virtual 7.1 surround sound from front firing speakers. The internet is very fast to load, the multiscreen function is excellent as is the use of the stylus with note,polaris, or photoshop preloaded are all plusses, especially since I am a teacher who needs a tablet for more than just fun.

I was hoping to purchase the tablet from Amazon but Costco was offering an unbeatable deal. Plus, their return policy is 90 days no questions asked whereas Amazon is 30 days unopened.\n\nInitially, I was interested in a 7\" tablet, because I thought it would be more convenient to carry around than a 10\" tablet. I bought the Samsung Galaxy 7\" Tab 2. It is a good quality product that can easily fit into a backpack or purse. However, a month later I tested the Note 10.1 and especially liked the S Pen, which is the stylus. Having been a long time Palm Pilot and Treo fan, the S Pen resurrected a familiar friend. By the way, Palm was ahead of its time. If only they had been on top of their strategic planning, Apple and Samsung would be playing catch up today. Anyway, before deciding on the Note10.1, I returned the 7\" Tab 2 and tested the iPad and Surface tablets. The iPad Retina display is a beauty and iOS is user-friendly. However, the iPad feels heavy and is over priced. Because I have an Android OS mobile phone, it would only make sense to keep streamlined with an Android OS tablet. The Surface is sweet. I love the cardboard thin Bluetooth keyboard that connects magnetically. However, the Surface is a bit pricey and I've learned the hard way not to buy any first generation Microsoft product. Although it was tempting especially with the new Nokia Lumia 920 as a pair, I was sold on Samsung's S Pen.\n\nIf you are seeking in depth research on specs and features, there are many great Amazon reviews with such details. I am a casual user and tech/gadget enthusiast. I will probably never tap into the deep potential of the Note 10.1, but that's okay. After several weeks exploring and loving the S Pen, the Samsung Galaxy  Note 10.1 is a definite keeper. I recently purchased an excellent MoKo Slim-Fit Folio Cover Case from Amazon for just $20. I'm glad I didn't buy one for $50 at BestBuy. If you are a student, the Note 10.1 is an excellent tool. I wish this product existed when I was in college. I just bought my wife the Samsung Galaxy Note II phablet. It is like a 5.5\" version of the 10.1 tablet. We are both very satisfied owners of the Samsung Galaxy Note family of products. Highly recommended! BTW, I composed this review with my Note 10.1."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Even the most devout fan of Android would have to concede that it has failed to repeat its smartphone success in the tablet arena. But in the second half of 2012 Google tried to change that. They updated Android to more competitive version 4.x and released their own tablet, Nexus. Which in 7\" version competes in price with Amazon Kindle and wipes price-wise iPad mini.\n\nBut the most prominent tablet released during this attack on iPad dominance and preemptive strike before the release of tablets with Windows 8, was actually Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 which was released in August 2012 with Android 4.0. Along with S-pen, the device has amazing quality of internal speakers and generally as a media consumption device it competes with iPad head-to-head. Apple felt the pain and promptly sued Samsung. Google maps are fantastic on this device :-). As for standard Android applications, B&N Nook Reader is available out of the box. Amazon Kindle needs to be installed. Adobe Acrobat also needs to be installed.\n\nThis tablet is more capable then iPad due to presence of Wacom active digitizer and S-pen. With S-pen, you can write notes as if you have a pen and a paper. That's an amazing feeling. Due to S-pen and Wacom active digitizer this tablet essentially wiped out as competitors all Android tablets without Wacom digitizer (including Google Nexus) and has main competition only among newer and more expensive Intel-based Windows 8 tablets such as Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T. Difference in price with Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T is approximately $150.\n\nI am using it as an expensive and super capable personal organizer and so far I am a satisfied customer. You can use it all day and recharge at night.\n\nIn other words, tablets with S-pen and Wacom digitizer are a new class of tablets, with new, important areas of use. But Intel-based Windows 8 tablets has the same advantages and more capable OS, so you need to decide what you want. If you use the tablet mainly as an organizer and media consumption device its OK. It you plan to double it as netbook or laptop, then Windows 8 tablets are preferable. So if you feel that you might need Bluetooth keyboard, it might be better to get Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T, otherwise this tablet is adequate and cheaper. Battery life is approximately the same.\n\nAnother advantage of this tablet is that you can rely on the huge amount of Linux-style Android applications such as SSH server and rsync (simplifies backups of your data), hacker keyboard, VNC etc. With SSH and VNC your laptop becomes external input device for the tablet.\n\nProvided default ecosystem is definitely closed Apple-style and you need to apply efforts to break the straitjacket you are put in. That why I put one star down. For example, you can download MP3 files from your desktop to the tablet via USB link using charging cable, and you can download them directly to the Samsung player Music directory. But this sucker does not list them. Still you can play them if you use file browser and click on the file. In this case there is a popup that proposes two players and you can choose any of them.\n\nIn summary, the main attractions of the tablet is S-pen which makes it possible to use it as a personal organizer as well as access to Linux applications ported to Android. Power users who know Linux well can benefit from this tablet by using proven and well known Linux applications ported to the Android platform. Those power users, who don't know Linux might be better served by Windows 8 Pro tablets with Intel CPUs. For example, if you plan to work with Office documents on the tablet get Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T -- a better tablet for power users who need keyboard with the tablet."}

When i received it there wasn't much to the packaging which is a surprise since amazon's shipped items are usually stuffed with bubble, paper wrapping etc. The tablet was ready right out of the box. Its pretty fast and the size is just right. I haven't played around with it quite extensively as yet, but so far so good. The only think that could have been improved is the resolution. At the $450+ price range the resolution should be 1920 X 1200 versus the 1280X800 it presents.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "This is an amazing tablet.  I was very worried about the resolution, so before I purchased it I went to the local Fry's to check it out in person.  The screen is great for what I use it for.  I mainly use it for writing notes and text editing, but videos do look great on it.  It took a few days to get used to the stylus, but now I love it.  I have played with the Photoshop that it comes with, and it seems decent, but I don't do much photo editing, so I have no idea how it compares to other products.  My only complaint is how lacking the Micros SD support is.  Even though it's there, it doesn't appear to be used very much, but I'm going to fix that by rooting it and swapping the internal 16Gb with a 64GB MicroSD card.\n\nIn the end, I would recommend this to anyone who would use the stylus often.  If you don't need the stylus, then there are better tablets in the same (and even lower) price range.  However, if you take a lot of notes, or have a good need for the stylus, you don't be disappointed in this tablet."}

It's just as slim and light as the ipad, it has awesome screen resolution, it has excellent battery life, it processes things quickly and smoothly, I can use the stylus for drawing, taking notes, etc.., I can use it to see what's on TV and control my home theater system (with no additional costs or equipment), and I can see flash player based applications on it.

However, I must admit, it is well built, feels good in your hands, looks crisp and runs super smooth.  Anyway, I decided to switch to an Android tablet given that all our phones use that OS and we're happy with it.  The choice came between the 10.1 Samsung Note and the Asus T700 Transformer.  Maybe I have more trust in the Samsung brand, I don't know, that was my first choice.  I returned it after 2 days.  It feels like a cheap piece of plastic in your hands.  No wonder BestBuy can get people to pay about 30% more just for a one year warranty addition.  They probably have to replace almost one out of every three sold, they are built so cheaply.\nIt runs ok, but Samsung would do well to educate the potential customers as to why that stylus of theirs is so great.  I didn't have the time and the patience to search the web to find out what sets this apart.  Couldn't find much educational stylus stuff in the tablet itself.\nThe Asus has better screen resolution(1,920 by 1,200 or (224ppi) vs. Samsung with 1,280 by 800 pixels or 149(ppi)), better processing power(1.6GHz vs 1.4GHz in the Ssamsung) and twice the memory right out of the box.  With the keyboard adapter it also has more battery, easy USB hookup and a full size SD card slot.  Not to mention the laptop form factor.  It is also built sturdy and with a nice aluminum back.  The only thing the Samsung has better is a pair of stereo front facing speakers and supposedly the stylus.  The Samsung was disappointing considering the choices at this price point"}

Although it would be probably helpful for an experienced user to root it so that you can get a better control on some of the software or at least try and split some of the program memory onto the external SD card, at 16GB, it's plenty of room for any user.  The screen and build quality is above par and it sure beats carrying a laptop unless you are doing some serious work.  Compared to others, the only other rival tablet in my opinion would be the Asus Infinity (TF700 series) with their slightly faster quad core.  Overall, I like the build on this.  My wife has the older Tab 10.1, so I was a little bias to continue using their propriatary connector-to-usb cord.

Ive had an iPhone for three or four years, and my initial inclination was to stick with the familiar, but I ultimately decided on the Samsung and couldn't be happier with my purchase. This is my first Android product and I must admit there was a learning curve as I was getting it all set up the way I wanted, but thats all behind me now.\n\nOne of the things I love is the flexibility of configuring screens with the various widgets that are available; it gives me so much more control over how the tablets looks and even works. Im also big on the memory card slot. I haven't used the S-pen a lot, but in the little experimentation Ive done, it works as advertised, and its high time someone developed a stylus with a fine point rather than those stupid, rubber-nosed things that are like writing with a clowns nose.\n\nOne of the magazine reviews I read criticized the Note for its plastic case, but Im finding I rather like it. Its very light for a large tablet, so I don't mind holding it for long stretches while reading or watching a movie. It also feels very secure in my hands. With the iPad, I felt as though I had to be extra cautious for fear of it slipping out my hands.\n\nOn the minus side are the location of the headphone jack and the Google Play store (formerly Android Market). The jack sits along the top of the tablet (if you're holding it in landscape mode). This is mostly a problem when watching videos, as I have to consciously move the headphone cord off to one side and hold it there so its not dangling across the screen. Putting on the jack on the side or bottom would have made more sense. Also, Id heard of the shortcomings regarding the Play store, but figured certainly Id have access to the apps I most wanted. By and large, this is true, but there are some apps I have on my phone that Id like to have on my tablet, however they aren't available for Android. Its more of an annoyance than an actual problem, but worth noting."}

I also tried the original Galaxy Note phone which also has a Wacom digitizer and walked away very unimpressed.\n\nBut that phone only had Android 2.3 and 256 levels of pressure, and I know that when I upgraded my own phone to Android 4.0, which the Note 10.1 ships with, my phone became much more responsive.  I also noticed that all the reviews only glanced over the S-Pen.  There were none written by any artist.  Since I would be using this 99.9% of the time for drawing, I decided to try it in the store... and I was sold.\n\nFast forward about three months, I still love this thing.  I can now draw while lounging at a cafe instead attempting to occupy the microscopic table w/ my laptop, Wacom tablet, and a full cup of coffee.  Photoshop Touch was a bit of a disappointment as it doesn't seem optimized for drawing w/ a precision pen and I can't seem to transfer files w/o Adobe Cloud, which I don't use.  That said, Layer Paint, Sketchbook Pro, and TV Paint more than serve my needs.  Battery lasts well past any reasonable time I'd feel like being out drawing.\n\nDo I wish it had Jelly Bean and the premium suite?  Sure.  But, it's responsive enough w/o.  I'll wait for them to do it right as the update will add alot more than just Android 4.1.\nDo I wish it had a higher res screen?  Sure.  But my eyes aren't that great, and the resolution is about the same as the ultra expensive Cintiq.. which you need to hook up to a laptop anyway.\nDo I wish it wasn't made of plastic and didn't creak? Sure.  But, I hardly notice, especially with the case.\nDo I wish it could freely copy/paste and open up any large Photoshop file w/ all my different adjustment layers?  Sure.  But, does any tablet do this?  Shrink the file into one or two layers w/o the fancy adjustment layers, and you'll be fine to open it in LayerPaint or TV Paint.\n\nAs an extra: I can copy and paste files to and from my laptop no problem.  No \"syncing\" necessary.  It'll only be a bigger pile of win when my microSD card arrives.  It also has no problems playing just about any video file I throw it at it: avi, mkv, wmv, whatever!\n\nThe mini-apps for now are not so useful to me, but if the videos of the leaked Jelly Bean roms are to be believed, they will be.  They will include mini-apps for the gallery and the browser to name a couple.\n\nIf you judge it as a tablet for the same purposes as an iPad or any other medium consumption device, the Note 10.1 is \"only\" on par.  If you judge it as a tool for productivity (and creativity), the Wacom S-pen on this thing really separate it from the pack (until more Windows tablets come out)."}

I'm a somewhat savvy computer user but am relatively new to the smartphone world and this is my first tablet, so keep that in mind.\n\nOut of the box there were very few instructions so I stumbled my way along and finally downloaded the online manual.  The display is nice and bright and battery life pretty good, nice sound from front-facing speakers, very fast. Pretty easy to customize home screens once I had instructions.\n\nI was really glad I purchased screen savers, a carrying case, and a 32 Gig MicroSD chip along with the tablet.  I put the Mini-guard matte anti-glare screen protector on right out of the box so there would be minimal chance for dust and that worked really well.  The protector looks great (little glare), works fine with the S-pen, and wasn't too hard to get on without bubbles. Haven't yet figured out how to put files onto the SD chip instead of the internal drive.\n\nThe tablet comes with a two year 50 Gig access to Dropbox (file storage).  After two years that will cost you...current price for 50 Gig is $10/month.  Free Dropbox storage is only 2 gig.  If you switch to SugarSync you could get 5 Gig for free. Dropbox also recently had a data breach, so that may be a consideration. I haven't decided yet whether to activate Dropbox or switch to SugarSync.\n\nI've had a few issues and was surprised to find Samsung Customer Support not very helpful.  The Accuweather widget was displaying the wrong time and I couldn't figure out why. Samsung didn't know either and could only suggest I reset the tablet and go back to factory specs, which I refused to do (didn't want to lose the apps I'd downloaded).  With some googling I discovered that I'd neglected to set the GMT time field. The main tablet clock display was correct; only the weather app was wrong.  Turns out that once I set the GMT to Eastern Std Time, the weather app sync'ed just fine. Glad I didn't reset.\n\nI also want to be able to charge my tablet from my car, and called Samsung to find out what the watt, volt and amp requirments would be for an inverter to charge the tablet. After being on hold for a few minutes I was told that only the design team has that information and they won't release it because they are protecting against someone reverse-engineering their design.  Sigh... I guess I will again have to hunt for myself to see if I can find specs.\n\nI don't know whether Samsung is inexperienced in the tablet world and their customer service isn't up to speed, or they are reacting to all the litigation issues with Apple, or both, but I'm disappointed that I'm having to figure things out myself.  Probably a good learning experience for me, but be forewarned if you're not really tech-savvy and wanting to venture into the tablet world....you won't get much help from Samsung.  I hope I don't have any warranty issues..."}

Although the new ipad is pretty and shinny, it lacks a lot of features that the Galaxy Note 10.1 has.  First off, I must say Samsung has come a LONG way within the past few years. They really stepped their game up.  I LOVE the pen. It is the best I have ever seen.  The tip has a more defined point as opposed to the old eraser head.  I love that I can open and edit word documents by free writing on the document (without it looking like I let a kindergartener grade my papers), or I can insert text boxes and include text.  I can also highlight documents. I can edit word documents and presentations.  It comes with POLARIS OFFICE pre installed for FREE! It has S Note which is a really cool app that lets you take notes and transform your hand writing to text.  Visually, the screen is beautiful and very appealing.  Although the ipad is just a tad more fluid when scrolling or sliding through apps, there isn't a huge difference.\n\nAll in all I chose this over the ipad. I feel that the ipad is just a bigger version of my phone.  The tablet is a really nice change and I love love love it. Very happy with my purchase as a student and a mother who lets her 15 month old son watch Netflix on her tablet.  Now I can let him watch while I am doing something completely different on the bottom half of the screen. Great job Samsung.  I cant wait to see what is next."}

Yes the Ipad 4 and Infinity both have high resolution screens, but having those screens doesn't make up for the abilities that the Note 10.1 has. I compared the screens when I was at Best Buy on Black Friday and honestly could not tell the difference. If your techie nit picker, then you'll be able to tell the difference but not to an everyday normal user. If you want bang for your buck, the Note 10.1 is just the device for that. The Note 10.1 has a much faster processor and more ram (2GB) than both the Ipad 4 and infinity. It just has more overall capabilities.\n\nOh yeah, and the plastic case that some people are complaining about is not even an issue. Its glossy so it makes it look nice and its ALOT lighter than the Ipad 4 and infinity. I'm coming from a galaxy tab 10.1 so was already used to the plastic casing.\n\nYou get 50gb of free storage with Dropbox which is an added PLUS. I am now able to synch a portion of my external drive of pictures that I can view across all my devices. Not to shabby!\n\nThe photoshop app that lets you modify/edit photos is awesome. I probably won't use that app alot but my wife loves it and will probably use it more than me."}

I played it at best buy for a while and I was drooling. I gave a few days for myself before put a purchase order. Why? It is pricey, isn't it? I did not want to regret for my decision.\nI take my Note with me to meetings. I jot down all the discussions during meetings, highlight with digital markers for certain things, add signatures, save my writings as pdf files, and send them to people. I just hate using laptop during meetings - the clicking sound from keyboard just distracts everyone and sometimes it can be quite annoying. Physical papers, nice but archiving it is just pain in the butt. Finally, I am using a digital paper!\nAlso, some apps allow me to take advantage of s-pen's pressure sensitive input. I occasionally sketch things, s-pen is quite responsive and its behavior is predictable although not perfect. Most of the issues arise from apps not the Note/s-pen.\nMy major gripe is lack of specially designed apps. There are just a few of them, mostly included with the Note. Adobe, are you guys working for illustrator for android? Please tell me you are working hard... Photoshop touch is nice but it ain't illustrator.\nI use Note pretty much indoors, so I am not in the position to tell people whether the screen is bright outside. But I feel it is quite bright, usually I put 30-40 % of maximum brightness.\n\nWhat was the reason to use 30 pin adapter instead of using microUSB? Anyone please explain me the real benefits of using proprietary interface? I am not an electronic engineer so please tell me, is it necessary to do that? I have about dozen microUSB cables in my house and my office, I could just use any of these as I do for my phone. There are only 2 small electronics using proprietary interface in my possession - Cowon J3 and Note 10.1. It is seriously not cool!\nWell, in my defense I simply could not ignore the quality of sound from J3 and decided to buy it. No regrets, but I hate it whenever I have to find the specific cable. Note 10.1, I got an additional cable... still not cool.\nOkay, I don't have to charge the Note that often so it is not too bad. But I am hoping the battery has long life.\n\nThese are my opinions about the Note 10.1 from about a few week long usage. I will update as I get more with my Note in the future.\n\nFYI: I am an expert in windows and linux. I do not care for mac and i things, do not agree with the rotten fruit company's policy (I am also fluent in mac os 7, 8, 9, and OSX). Just let you know about my background.\n\nBottom line: the ability of Note to let me write with s-pen and being android are great. Proprietary interface to charge, seriously not cool. Last thing, it is not the Note's fault. Adobe/Google what in the name of Gxx did you guys stop supporting flash in the browser? You guys don't even have backup yet. Can you bring that back? I would like to watch amazon prime videos like I do with my phone."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "This is my first tablet.... and i love it. Ive had it for about 2 months now. I always wanted a tablet, however i didn't want to be disappointed when i bought my first tablet. Ive had an ipod touch so i figured an ipad would be the same... and i used my aunts ipad and im glsd to say that i love this more, because it does so much more. Surprisingly i use the stylus often, whether its for online shopping and hovering over image previews, writing notes in class, or writing a note on a screen shot.\n\nI actually bought the samsung stylus with an eraser on ebay. Apparently samsung is way behind on its production in america. Like they still don't sell the keyboard dock, even though they have it in england, china, etc. So i bought the stylus pen on ebay and love that too, highly recommend! Its black btw andsold for around 25$. The white one thats $200 or so is the bluetooth stylus which can be used as a phone speaker just hold it up to your ear. I thought that was cool.... however a tad too pricey for me.\n\nI recommend getting a tpu case and possibly like a zippered sleeve to cover it. I bought one of the tri fold cases at bestbuy for temporary protection. Although i love having the built in stand on the go, writing with the stylus and bumping into the corners is annoying. I would usually just remove the case anyways because it was annoying. So with the tpu case, the edges are almost the same height as the screen, and plus you have back protection.\n\nIts very fast, and i love it because its faster than my infuse 4g in terms of wifi connection and regular speed going through apps and what not... thats to be expected. So i do prefer using my tablet over my phone in that aspect. However i hsve my eye set on the gnii that just came out. I love the note series!\n\nI also bought this sd converter on ebay, and i can view, edit, and copy pictures from the sd card. Also because of sandy and haven't used a flash drive in a few years... i was stuck without a way to transfer my school essays without internet. So putting them on my sd card and having the converter did help. I am a freelance photographer, so i wouldnt mind showing my clients their pictures onmy tablet in thefuture(havent done so yet.) Usually i use dropbox for school and file sharing.\n\nI also recommend the logitech bluetooth android keyboard. I use the built in case/stand to hold up my tablet. The keyboard is nice too, slightly lagged when you backspace and remove words, but its really nice. Im not even sure i want the official keyboard dock because this keyboard does the same exact thing imguessing for much cheaper.however the dock has its pros too.\n\nThe photoshop app thst came with this tablet is pretty nice, its really like photoshop on the go. However it is slightlymore frustrating to work with, but minor retouches i think come out just as good as the computer program.\n\nI do recommend getting lecturenotes because its good for taking down notes. Therss also a paid audio additiom to lecturenotes that lets u record audio. I have bought it but have only used it once as a test. Writing and recording just domt work as you hear the stylus sound. But this is a good app bc there are stylus options like only eriting with the stylus. So i love being able to rest my palm all over the screen and not affect my note taking. The only snnoyance is accidently hitting the notifications time button in the corner. But i love that it only writes with the stylus. And 2 clicks on the side of the stylus turns it into an eraser. Or if you bought the eraser black stylus, just flipping it 180 like a pencil will erase automatically. S notes i use more for like fun drawing or writing some type of diary entries.\n\nI use this for my college classes. However i must say that eventhough it is nice to carry less to class, i do like the feel of real paper as it cushions your hand. So i only use this for myhistory class 3hrs a week, because any longer then 1.30 in a day makes ur hand tired with constantly writing notes down.\n\nAnd just today i installed flash because i didn't know how. Just go into the. Adobe android archives for ics 4 and download the latest. I think my flash works now... i haven't really tested it, but one of the vids that required flash before now plays so i think its up and working.\n\nThe tablet is amazingly fast and fun to play with, good for gaming. Im actually looking into getting an android game controller to really make this tablet even more amazing.\n\nAlso as a side note, its expected that a tablet is not a laptop and shouldnt be a replacement. I do writd my essays on here with the logitech keyboard, however it is slightly frustrating to write papers when you have a backspace problem deleteing more words than just one. And i usually have to edit in word on the computer to fix the errors like thd 1in spacing on the sides and spelling errors, etc. So it is more time consuming than typing things on a laptop or regular computer. But for on the go use its fantastic, and helps me get things done for school.\n\nIm always using my tablet watching movies, youtube vids, you name it. I absolutely love this thing. I personally think it does and is worth so much more than an ipad. The battery lasts pretty well in my opinion. However i might not be the best person to talk about batteries since my infuse 4g phone battery lasts like 2 hours and i always carry backups with me. This tablet im guessing lasts like 6 hours, i haven't really checked. But i thino thats amazing (compared to my phone lol....)\n\nBtw the facebook app can use a lot of work, but using facebook in your app browser fixes a lot of the problems.."}

I've had cell phones since the original bag type that weighed more than my purse, trading in every two yrs or so.\n\nThe incredible size is what caught my eye.  This phone is AWESOME in every way.  Am continually finding more apps to download with the latest being a super bright flashlight.  It does everything an Ipad can do and more.  I purchased an extra 32 gig card and have downloaded tons of albums to play at work, and still have plenty of space for more.  Despite it's wonderful size, it still fits in the back pocket of my jeans.\n\nAnother feature I LOVE over my last phone (Iphone 3) is the back is removable so you can easily remove the battery & cards.  When I switched I was still using the Iphone as a music player.  However, a can of soda exploded in my bag and I couldn't EVER get it to properly dry out, despite watching the How-to videos on YouTube, so now that is just a paperweight!\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this phone to EVERONE who wants a computer that weighs ounces.  I've used the GPS a few times, have several books on it, check my e-mail - you name it!  I think you'll be as thrilled as I am with your purchase!  Another note - do NOT buy an expensive case, extra charging cord or any accessories at a retail or phone store!  You can get a decent ones right here on Amazon for pennies on the dollar."}

It's got PhotoShop preinstalled.\nThe flash player has to be downloaded manually by going to app store and search for adobe flash player installer. after installing the installer just hit download and install and enjoy the flash sites.\nThe adobe reader needs to be downloaded and it offers a great deal of features in it like highlight text in different colors, add stickies and notes into it and it is very smooth.\nThe games play very smooth like GTA3 vice city stories and some others.\nIt is a universal remote control that means it controls all kinds of tv's, dvd, blue ray players and dish network boxes and a lot more.\n\nOverall Its a great deal and worth spending $499.

The S-Pen makes this tablet the choice for me.  It increases productivity and gets rid of having notes everywhere and always carrying a planner.  Plus, of course syncing with you google-cal is great.  One note:  don't use Polaris office if you want your .docx documents to be formatted correctly when you reopen them in Word.  Get King Office instead, it is free doesn't mash up formatting.  Plus it's actually easier and better.  If you are looking to \"do\" things this is the right tablet to choose.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "After using a note 10.1 for 10 days now for college, I personally don't get it. The multitasking is little more than samsung showing you 2 apps at once; you still can only really do one useful thing at once. If you have a browser open and are downloading something, and have sNotes next to it, when you tap over to sNotes, the browser stops downloading. Why you may ask? Because in reality you just closed your browser, you just don't know it. Then, for the classes I'm taking the apps that do offer the multi-tasking are useless. I need to use the apps for my particular set of classes: Wolfram alpha, real calculator, greys anatomy for example(bioengineering/premed), as well as browsers like firefox, or chrome. Too bad they don't work in multiscreen because this is a samsung hack. It's gonna be a while before they do I suspect.\n\nThe mini apps at the bottom are also useless in quality and content to me and they are one more thing that gets pressed and opens when I hand my tablet to someone else. If I could put my apps (realcalc or some other graphing calculator) down there then maybe, but really, if I could turn off the mini app option I would. I hate it. Its almost as bad as taking notes and having your ability to write all of a sudden stop because you've activated either the notifications window or the mini apps by accident.\n\nPersonally, the customization of minute things in the OS are just not interesting to me and I've noticed that many of the settings that my HTC phone offers are just missing all together. However, androids always felt almost done, but not quite done to me any way. However, samsung then come along and really don't help the cause at all.\nCan any one tell me why I need multiple clocks or weather widgets all telling me the same thing over and over in multiple screens? Apparently, android developers see the need to offer me the ability to tinker with my OS settings multiple times a day. I don't have time for that and want it out of the way.\nI believe that many of the inadvertent activations of these various screens could have been prevented by putting this bottom Home/MiniApps/Notifications bar at the top of the screen like on many phones. Why put soft buttons where we hold the tablet or rest our palms?\n\nI've tried implementing the stylus pen into my math and science class note taking, but really, it just costs me time. if I need to grab a graph of some sort that I've drawn to move in my notes, forget it, it's only grabbing pieces of the drawing at a time. Every time you lift the pen, the tablet considers it a new drawing, instead of letting you choose an area of lines and deciding that everything in such area is your drawing in its entirety. I don't understand why it allows me to type right over the top of annotations I've made, and the write to text is just (for me) unreliable. The terminology is just not in the data base and my corrections would not stick.\n\nThe hardware sounded great on paper, and for the most part I've had no issues with lag or connections. In walking around in Bestbuy I see more responsive tablets. In the end, I think it was samsung that ruined it for me and I just feel this tablet is a little gimmicky.\nFor the money I expected a better app experience from samsung. I need a few apps that work, not 20 where half of them are crap and the other half half work with one or two stand outs. 18 credit hours this semester and this tablets cost me so much in wasted time I feel like billing samsung. I pull out the ultrabook and blaze through note taking, look up things like graphs and insert them into my notes infinitely better. I save and annotate pdf's just fine and all my school books are through kno.com. Personally, I just think tablets are for light stuff. I need to do more than a few things at once and I need all of my features at the same time."}

In class, I prop up the note with the wedge's cover, and with the keyboard I can normally catch most of what the professor says as he says it. I'd give this thing six stars if I could. A seriously overlooked android tablet that regularly outperforms my friends window's 8 machine.\n\nIt feels like it's from the future six months after I bought it.\n\nI bought this tablet for the quad core 1.4 processor and GPU, and the specs altogether, but it was the S Note application together with S Pen that inclined me to the write this glowing review.  Let me start by saying I had low expectations for the S Note app.  I expected a half-assed branded app, put out to brag about as a feature.  What Samsung has delivered here is instead something that can rival LaTex in final product: Neat, orderly notes.  Never mind the smooth, accurate, and responsive pen input, this tablet comes loaded with a pretty accurate function input tool, a shapes tool, and a writing-to-type input feature in it's productivity tools.  Hand write and equation as the professor spews his dirty intellectual filth on his white board, and I jot it down, poorly, and Samsung picks up the slack by turning into a neat formula. I hit \"insert\", size the object down a la MS word, and move it with a drag gesture to place it where I wish.  The take away here is this: If you're a student, don't buy and iPad, buy one of these.  If you're a writer or an engineer or anyone who actually wants neat documents made on the fly WITH YOUR HAND, pick one of these up.  The iPad just can't compete for productivity.  And if you're on the Microsoft side of things with your tablet preference, good news: Samsung owns the stylus tech, the algorithms, and the app, so expect to see a Win RT S Note released on their Win 8 surface products.  That said, the way android performs on this tablet, it's quite capable without x86! I have to mention that this machine is pretty powerful... I drag and drop a calculator around while note taking, and sometimes I drag a movie over my notes too :P"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "So I have been very patient for a very long time and have held off on buying a tablet. My goal ultimately for any tablet I bought was to have it replace about 90% of my laptop needs.\n\nThis tablet does that and so much more!!  I made sure to do a ton of research before purchasing. Some of the things I do on a daily basis on my laptop (which is over 3 years old and needs a cooling pad to not overheat, ugh!) is email, web browsing, Netflix, Hulu, HBOGo, Amazon Videos, listen to music, photo editing, blogging on Wordpress, Office stuff, managing my websites via GoDaddy, Facebook...and that's pretty much it. Nothing too heavy, but the video stuff and photo editing are deal breakers for me.\n\nOut of the box I updated it & installed a Flash APK. I right away tested watching a video from Amazon Instant Video; did a jig when it worked perfectly!\n\nI love the display. All the video apps I installed worked really well with Hulu Plus being an exception, it was kinda jumpy, but I don't watch it all that much unless I miss one of my shows on cable.\n\nI practiced using all the different keyboard options, and the one I really like by far is the split screen option to use with your thumbs when holding the tablet horizontal. My second favorite option is the handwriting one, although it takes a bit of getting used to. Right now I am typing this using a Logitech bluetooth keyboard I bought, because I knew it would be a pain to type long emails or documents with a digital keyboard.\n\nI still haven't had time to test the PS Touch, but all I really need to be able to do is layer pictures, which isn't really taxing or anything.\n\nI did buy an adapter so I could use my USB drive, and it works perfectly! It recognizes all my pictures, videos, documents, PDFs, etc. I back everything up on my USB so it was really important to me that the My Files system worked well, and it does!\n\nI installed the Firefox browser and it works very fast and I really like the tab system. I can do work on the internet just like on my old laptop.\n\nI see myself being very happy with this tablet, and I also see it boosting my productivity. I need to explore the drawing apps and notetaking apps more, but I take a lot of notes throughout the day so I am sure I will find a method I like. So far I have installed Papyrus Beta, Quill, and LayerPaint. In 'testing' modes I enjoyed Papyrus the best. Another goal of mine was to increase how much I do artistically, and I want to explore watercolor techniques on here. The S Pen is awesome and I think with the right app I will be able to do so much more than with the ole' pen & paper!\n\nI've been playing with this thing for hours and I haven't had time to install any games, but I saw test videos online of people playing games and it seems fast with great graphics.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know! I know I had plenty before deciding to purchase!\n\nEDIT\n\nI played around with PS Touch and it worked great for layering pictures. I also went more in depth with LayerPaint & I loooved the watercolor effect, great app for any artist."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "About me: I'm a 22 year old female. I'm an artist and I work 2 jobs where I am on the go a lot.  The note is a big help because I have nice little piece of technology to store ideas & checklists and check important emails with. I have had this tablet for about 4 weeks now.\n\nI bought this tablet because I was looking for a digital graphics tablet that was portable.  Originally I was seeing only tablets that were specifically for drawing and worked in addition to a computer. I wanted something thin, portable and easy to use.\n\nMain things I like and use it for:\n-Drawing out ideas with the pen and saving them to different folders to organize\n-Writing To Do Lists and ideas in my own hand writing. I like having them all in one place and not having to carry around folders and sketch books that will eventually fray and have pages fall out.\n-Surfing the internet away from home.- Checking balances and paying bills.\n-It has a nice map & navigation feature but I don't think either can work without internet connection, which is a downfall because if you're on the road and don't have it then it's useless.\n-I like planning with my calendar that comes with it, but I may try to find a different calendar app that let's me write with the pen and put little pictures on it to spruce it up.\n-Taking webcam pics daily and using the back camera to take pictures of my home cooked meals or quick snaps of things I made.\n-Reading. It comes with Nook. But what I am disappointed about with that is that it doesn't have every book that I want to read! You would think they would have everything. Kindle has a lending library that I wish Nook had something similar so I could check that out.\n\nA note about surfing the internet- It has a mobile view that has the more simplistic layout of websites for faster surfing, but you can also switch to desktop view to see the page in full like on a regular computer which is a great feature!\n\nSo far it has served its purpose with very few glitches.  Lately I have been experiencing a glitch where the internet won't close out when I hit the x. Hopefully that will go away, it's not that big of an issue.\n\nThe biggest issue I realized with it, is that flash is not supported on it.  This means that if there are games you want to play on a website or anything that supports flash and even videos you try to watch (not through the youtube app), you will be unable to see it.  The Note does come with a youtube & Netflix app so you can watch anything through it.  I would like for this device to support the Direct tv for mobile devices so I can watch normal programs through it too. That would be perfect!\n\nI really hope that in the future there will be drawing apps specifically for this tablet.  I have drawn a few things now with it on Snote [which is really just for ideas and sketches] and I am adjusting to its features.  What I am really hoping for is maybe a Photoshop type of app that you can do different layers with your artwork and add on masks and filters etc.  The ideal app would have what I just mentioned plus an array of brushes and tools where you can adjust pressure/lightness, smudge, sharpen and lighten/darken tools, and the feature where only your pen reacts to it. Because it's an issue when you're trying to draw but it's also registering your hand at the same time and the page will try to scroll or zoom.\n\nSo far this has worked really great for my needs and I hope that there will be some advances that I can benefit from in the future. I want this product to take artwork a little more seriously and be able to run apps that have in depth drawing features.\nThe Note becomes really comfortable and easy to use once you have a case for it.  It's very portable and just looks nice and I enjoy using it now that I have it customized.\nOne other thing: I wish they had a longer than 1 year warranty that you don't have to pay for."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I have been reading reviews for the Samsung Note for the past month and just about decided that I'll get the Galaxy 10 as the Note didn't seem to get as good ratings. Today, however, I stopped at BestBuy while buying paints (I'm an author and an artist) and boy was I blown away after trying the Galaxy and the Note side-by-side. Guarantee --when I next have $500+ to blow this is the tablet I will buy.\nThe Galaxy just was not as workable for writing and drawing, and I want to be able to do both on whichever tablet I get. The Note from the start was a dream come true. I have had a Tecra M7 Tablet for the past 10 years and love that I can write and draw on the screen with a pen, but it's heavy and battery life sucks. As a result, all three are requirements for whichever tablet I buy. Note does both and has a great battery life! I love that I can type in text or handwrite on the fly --at church or any place else where its needed.\nI would give my eyeteeth to be able to buy it now but, sadly, I will have to wait until the money is in the bank -- no credit card debt, thank you very much. You readers could help by buying one of my books from amazon (GPS for Life or Practical Parenting -- I was a counselor before deciding on being artist and author; I can write better than I counsel.).\nThis future acquisition gives me something to look forward to. Way to go Samsung!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I have been waiting for years for this product to arrive. I can finally take notes with my own handwriting in a comfortable format. I also like to draw, though it's not really at a high level. I actually had a good old Nokia N800 4.3\" tablet I took notes with a few years back, but it was a resistive screen and clearly not the right format. I also had a netbook with a wacom bamboo, and a PC convertible tablet (heavy). These worked well on drawing, but clearly not for taking notes in the tiny seats we get at university. I then jumped to an android tablet, the ASUS transformer. I really liked it, the joys of Android are not lost on me, but notes was out of the question, even with a capacitive stylus. So I got excited to get the Note 10.1 I have traded all of my notebooks for S Note, and drawing is great with Sketchbook Pro for Android.\nThere are even a few cool tools in SNote like formula match (I have gotten the most wows out of my fellow students with this one, write a formula, get it recognized, then click search to have wolfram plot a graphic and calculate its value),  a shape detector that makes circles, squares and lines for graphics, and handwriting recognition, but I haven't really used that, I prefer my own handwriting, really. If you study anything that forces you not only to write but also to draw schematics, graphics and the like, this is a great tool to have everything in a digital copy :).\n\nI also pull it out to play some games with my friends in the cafeteria, Spit! and Reversi are some of the favorites for killing time and work well in 2-player mode.\n\nPROS\n\nSPen Rocks, if you want to take notes by hand or drawing, its really comfortable. Maybe too small for big hands, but bigger alternatives are available.\nFront Speakers! It makes a difference, can't believe more tablets haven't got this feature\n\nMEH\nBattery is ok, It gets me trough the day, though I think my ASUS was better at this when I first got it.\nScreen is ok, it tends to gather a lot of fingers marks, fast.\n\nCONS\nIts pricey, specially if you don't need a pen.\nNo ready VideoOut, my ASUS had a micro hdmi that worked quite well, but with this one you have to buy an adaptor\nSeems to Scratch easily on the plastics, get a case!\n\nBottom line, if you think you are really gonna use the pen, then this is the tablet for you, if not, maybe a cheaper alternative would do, I was perfectly content with my old tablet, and the only reason I switched was the S-Pen, and its done wonders, I saving my notebooks in a digital format is great and I can share them with ease\n\nBonus for music lovers: S Note has a music sheet template :) Now my saxophone teacher wants one, too!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I have a Galaxy Note 10.1 and I absolutely love it.  I have an iPad 2 as well.  I use both but I find the Galaxy Note 10.1 far more fun to use and far more productive.\n\nHere are the differences, in my own view / opinion...\n\niPad 2:\n- Start iPad, and your main screen shows a bunch of shortcuts... BORING!\n- iPad WiFi model DOES NOT HAVE GPS hardware! Apple did a very good job hiding this info coz not many knows this, even my apple fan friends and co-workers didn't know it. Always tell them to google it. Only the iPad 3g/4g has GPS radio.  So if you tether and drive around, your car icon on the map will not get updated till about every minute or so. So when Navigating, and by the time you need to make a turn, you already passed it when iPad says, Left turn ahead!\n- The new iPad map SUCKS. Traffic updates are super slow, it SUCKS.  I asked for directions, it wants me to swim the ocean. Bring swimming gear!\n- No Adobe Flash, so most web sites right now, don't work! Wait for HTML 5 to be adopted more? A lot more?\n- iPad does indeed look nice, I give it that. I like the metal case. Makes my hands super cold though on winter; need gloves to use it.\n- I find my self using iPad for Web only, even before I bought the Note 10.1.\n- Hand me an iPad or iPhone, and I don't know what fun stuff to do with it coz when I start it, all I see are frkn a bunch of Shortcuts. At least my Windows 7 PC has Gadgets... Right???\n- iPad makes me look hip. Sorry to say, but many people still give that `interested' look if you have an apple device.\n- iPad 3 does have very nice resolution when I checked demo at best buy. iPad 2 screen looks the same to me as Note 10.1.\n\nGalaxy Note 10.1:\n- Note 10.1 main screen shows stuff that are working and doing something, so it's not boring. The Widgets. Almost all apps comes with Widgets.  If you want to see the boring Shortcuts page, tap the Apps button.\n- Note 10.1 gives you all kinds of working widgets i.e. weather, turn-on/off led flashlight, music player widget, photo album widgets, several time zone clocks, utility meters, Facebook updates, etc.  I don't need all of them, but I really like the Weather Widget and music player (i can do Next / Prev Song right there in main screen).\n- Load or take a lot of videos and then start the Video Player app and you'll be amazed.  ALL your videos are in Preview Mode. Not only it really looks nice seeing each box move, but it is DEFINITELY helpful in finding the video you want to view.\n- Multi-Screen ROCKS!  Very useful.\n- I was able to install Adobe Flash and now web pages that use Flash works.\n- WiFi-Direct Transfer functionality is very useful. You can transfer several files from/to another device with WiFi-Direct super fast.  From what I remember, 500 MB of pics and videos in like 1 minute.\n- Note 10.1 WiFi model HAS GPS radio hardware. So go ahead and tether it and drive around and ask for directions, you won't get lost. No need to wear swimming trunks.\n- Android released Talking NAVIGATION since like 2 or 4 yrs ago. Apple just now got it! And now all iPhone users say, Oh, my Nav Talks now! What da heck!\n- Google Maps ROCK. Traffic is fast. Navigation has SATELLITE VIEW option so it shows LANDSCAPE (or BIRDS EYE) SATELLITE View while it's navigating.  AMAZING!\n- S Pen is so useful for editing Pics, writing stuff, etc.\n- That pop-up video player ROCKS!\n- Note 10.1 does not look as nice as iPad. I don't like the plastic. I hope Samsung release metal models. Apple still reign on design, I think.\n- Note 10.1 Battery seems to run out faster. But then again, I use Note 10.1 a lot more than my iPad 2. And I know GPS radio uses more power (again iPad WiFi model do NOT have GPS radio; bring swimming trunks).\n\nAnyways, these are just my own thoughts and opinion. I know i sound like i really love the Note 10.1 a lot more than my iPad 2. I hope I did not offend anyone on this review.  Of course, reviews are really based on user preference."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Comparing the Note to the iPad 3 is like comparing a multifunctional Range Rover to a Lexus sedan. Both nice, but not in the same league.  The iPad is a quality device, but the Note just does so much more; it's in a completely different league. If you're looking for something iPad-like, look elsewhere. The Note is much more than an app tray.\n\nIt's not just the S-Pen either. It's the split-screen multitasking, the customization, 2mp front camera (iPad is VGA), quad core processor, removable/expandable memory card slot, full flash browser, live widgets. Then there's the floating video option which floats a video so you can 'watch' whilst multitasking. iPad 3 has none of this.\n\nThe S-Pen is so exacting, making the Note ideal for editors, students, artists & business folks. If you just hover the pen over an email or movie, a preview will pop up. Most laptops don't have these goodies.\n\nTo be fair, the iPad has nicer hardware and a higher pixel density screen. iTunes is far superior to Google Music, however, iTunes is quite limiting. The Note allows me to download free music from 4shared or beemp3 & send it w/o having to purchase it. There's a torrent app called aDownloader which can download free movies because Android isn't as locked-down as iOS. The iPad is a quality tablet, but, like the iPhone, it's just an app tray.\n\nI would recommend the iPad for kids or older folks who want something simple & don't need all of Note's goodies. For those who just want to surf the net, send emails, watch movies & play with apps, the iPhone is much more simple and direct. Grandma could pick up an iPad & start using it. That's precisely Apple's charm. There's nothing to configure or customize - squares on a screen & very well executed.\n\nThe Galaxy Note 10.1 is a high-tech device that Samsung just doesn't know how to promote or market. The iPad is a high quality tablet, but it operates like a big iPhone with limited memory. With all the Note's tech, customization and unique features, it is simply in a league of its own."}

I find the S pen quite responsive and the multitasking was really useful. I was able to email back and forth from Polaris to Word which was exactly what I had hoped for. I don't have anything negative to say about the tablet except that I keep taking screenshots by mistake but then again I am still getting used to the touch screen. The battery life is really good too. After having researched extensively on which tablet would better meet my needs I settled on this one and so far I have not been dissapointed.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "It's now been a bit over a week since I purchased my Samsung Note 10.1 tablet.  Not surprisingly I'm very happy with it - it has met and exceeded my expectations. In my particular case my netbook had a battery problem and getting a new one represented a decent fraction of the cost of something else. That and I only had one application that still used XP and I found a way around that on another PC.  Late last year I got a Kindle Fire and this spring I went for a smartphone.  So I had some experience with Android, although in the Fire's case it was pretty well wrapped up in the name of \"ease of use\".\n\nI'm not an Apple user - no particular reason other than I've been that way over 30 years. When looking for alternatives I can't say I even seriously considered an iPad.  I did look at the new retina display and, honestly, my eyes (older) can't make a case for the differential between the new iPad and the Note 10.1 on that issue. The device seems physically pretty solid to me so I can't see an issue here either. As I have with all portable electronics, I got a case (with a Bluetooth keyboard included - not high speed but it works) and put on a screen protector (just like on my smartphone). To me that's common sense; you have to judge your own risk level and the protections aren't that expensive relative to the device itself.\n\nWhy Samsung? I've had good luck with their products (TV's, range, etc.) and to be honest, I resent Apple's claims to have \"invented\" things like rounded corners - more the shame of the idiots who granted them patents.\n\nBut why the Note 10.1?  I had a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 on order but having seen the limits (reasonable I think given the media focus) placed on Android app's in that environment, I was interested in something more open.  I like to use a stylus and the Note appeared to be built around it.  So with the need to replace a laptop and a desire for something with less confining an application set, the Note 10.1 seemed to be the place to go. (I think my existing Kindle Fire will still be good for quite a while, particularly when traveling.)\n\nRather than talk about pro's and con's, I'd rather talk about my experience getting to know the Note 10.1.  First, I'd recommend that you get the Samsung SPSN app which gives you access to a set of videos, some of which focus on the Note 10.1.  Like most devices these days, everything is either \"intuitive\" or buried somewhere on-line if you can find it.  My intuition needs a boost now and then.\n\nView the available videos and you'll realize that the S Pen is pretty powerful and potentially useful.  You'll also get some tips on the various app's that support it. (As an aside, the S Note application appears to have different capabilities depending on how you invoke it.)  I'd also recommend you try a drawing/art application; in my case I'd simply say the most common wasn't my choice for the best.  With the right app you can do some really neat things fairly easily.  I have yet to make it through the PS Touch tutorials (they've \"intuitive\" sort of - but I've found going to see their videos helps as well).  I think this will be a useful app as well.  As for S Note, I can't say it recognized my writing yet.\n\nThere are some issues. If I want to print, I need a compatible Samsung printer (I have an HP).  But then again my HP isn't color and maybe I'll go for one for the art as well as photo's in general - Samsung printers get high ratings for color.\n\nWhat's next?  Well first, my wife seems interested - the last time she got interested I received my first Kindle and she took it over in a few weeks.  She tells me she can see better on the Note than on the PC (she had a detached retina a few years ago).  So I may end up with two of these one of these days.\n\nI really don't see, in my future, any more laptop/ultrabooks based on what this device can do.  For someone who bought his first PC in 1980 that says something.  I'll have a desktop for the high end stuff, like video editing, but I think the world has changed.  The Note 10.1 may not be everything, but it's enough to be a game changer, for me at least.  If you're thinking about a tablet, I suggest you give this device a careful look.  Check around for comparison videos, they may help you as well."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I just received this tablet 3 days ago & would like to offer my first impressions. The SGN 10.1 is my second tablet, the first being the original Kindle Fire. Sorry Amazon, I really enjoyed my Fire, but there were too many \"cons\" on my list to consider purchasing the new Kindle Fire HD.\nWhen researching my new tablet, I looked at all available options.  I decided I really did want the larger screen, so it boiled down to choosing the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 or SGN 10.1.  What really sold me on the Note was the hardware: 1.4 GHz QUAD-core processor and 2GB of RAM. I have a need for speed and thought the additional expense would be worth it. I wasn't really concerned with the S Pen at all, but now that I've had a chance to play with it, I can see how I will use it frequently. The micro-SD expansion slot and volume control buttons were also very important to me. And, I am looking forward to taking my first road trip and using the GPS.\nThis tablet is super fast. Several pre-loaded apps have the ability to multi-task and the tablet doesn't slow down when doing so. Wi-fi is incredibly strong in areas of my home where other devices have weak signals. There's a great selection of apps optimized for tablets from Google Play, Amazon App Store, and Samsung Apps. The front 5MP camera (with LED flash!) takes decent photos and videos, especially for social networking apps like Instagram & Twitter. I haven't used the front facing camera for video calls yet. The Peer IR remote easily synced with my Sony TV and Brighthouse cable box. I have read other reviews of people complaining about the screen resolution. I really don't understand.  The screen is bright and the colors are vibrant. Pictures and videos are stunning. And from what I understand, the lower (comparatively speaking) resolution helps save battery consumption.\nThe only disappointment I have so far is the proprietary charge/data cable.  I wish it had a micro-usb port.\nSo if you have the cash in your budget, I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1!"}

Hardware: many people complain about the built quality of this tablet, I don't find anything wrong with it, I think its a good plastic (it doesn't bend unless you push it hard) and once you have it, you don't even notice it.\n\n2. Software: I also own a transformer prime and the iPad 3 ( I gave the iPad to my nephew after I bought the note 10.1). The transformer crashes all the time even with the official jelly bean. This tablet is the best I've ever had, it's very smooth, not laggy at all and most important apps and browser don't crash. I hope I will get the same features as the galaxy note 2 when it gets jelly bean ( If you don't know what I'm taking about check out some YouTube videos and you will see the awesomeness of the note 2).\n\n3. The S pen: To me it feels better than writing on a piece of paper, its very responsive with more than 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity. I'm a college student so I use it in the classroom all the time, I only buy e-books so I don't have to carry around heavy textbooks, ebooks are  by far cheaper than textbooks. Also I can take notes directly on my ebooks and only see them when I need them. With the s pen app I can easily solve math problem just by writing the ecuation under the formula category of the app and I gives me the answer step by step and the graph if possible.\n\nThis are reviews from people that own the tablet, if you are looking for the best android tablet in the market, this is one of the best options,  believe you won't regret."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Having owned an original Motorola Xoom for the past twelve months or so, I am not new to Android tablets. Therefore, this review focuses on the improvements that I feel the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 brings to this type of device.\n\nDespite the Xoom doing most of the things I expect and want from a tablet, the Note includes certain compelling new features and improved capabilities that motivated me to upgrade.\n\nThe main justification for my buying the Note is the S-Pen. This is because I find it easier to handwrite and illustrate my meeting notes than to type them. I tried many tablet styluses on the Xoom because I actually prefer using a stylus over using my fingers (and leaving fingerprints). I soon discovered that none of the third party styluses offered any degree of precision. In fact, they are useless for handwriting and drawing! Therefore, an accurate stylus was something I really wanted in a tablet and the pressure sensitivity of the S-Pen is a bonus.\n\nIt's important to mention that in the show-case application (S-Note), you have an option to set the tablet to respond only to the stylus input. This means that you can rest your hand on the screen, like on a real notepad, to write and draw. This is definitely something unique to the Samsung Glaxy Note range and makes for much more natural input.\n\nSomething else I was interested in was the inclusion of phone functionality. With the Xoom, I used to receive SMS messages intended for the previous owner of the phone number associated with my SIM. The messages showed up in the notification area on the Xoom and I could open them in a window. However, I couldn't reply to them (or save them to reply some other way). With the Note, I now have access to SMS and MMS, as well as calls (although, they cost me extra on my data plan).\n\nThe clincher was when I found out the Galaxy range of tablets (and phones) have a useful host USB Connection Kit as a reasonably priced option. This kit provides access to many USB devices (including printers, USB sticks, keyboards, mouses and SD cards). In my experience, the Xoom can only manage hard-to-find, third-party host adaptors which were flaky at best.\n\nDespite the Note being about a centimetre wider and longer than the Xoom, it is much thinner and lighter. The extra bezel width makes holding the Note easier, without accidentally touching the screen area. Obviously, holding the Note for extended periods is much less fatiguing than with the much heavier Xoom.\n\nOne physical issue with the Xoom that annoys me is the location of the on-off button (on the back). This location has two disadvantages; it is difficult to get to when the tablet is lying on a desk and I often accidentally turn the Xoom on or off when grasping it (mainly when picking it up). The Note has its button conveniently located on the top edge of the device. So far, I have had far fewer accidents with it.\n\nThe screen on the Note is bright and clear and suits my needs, as is the case for the Xoom. I believe that neither of these tablets needs a higher resolution. I guess that cramming in more pixels for future tablets is inevitable, mainly due to the misguided quest to \"match\" the iSlab.\n\nBeing able to take screenshots (by pressing the button on the S-Pen and tapping and holding on the screen) is great. But when the image loads into an app that allows you to crop and annotate it, you have a whole new range of powerful and convenient productivity capabilities. Well done Samsung!\n\nThe Note is quite responsive, having a quad-core processor and 2Gb RAM. From the myriad reviews containing benchmarking, the Note seems to be one of the fastest tablets currently available. This translates into a more responsive experience. The extra RAM is also necessary as the Note can perform some \"multitasking\" by way of a number of apps that have been designed to run alongside each other. Additionally, there are some apps that are designed to run in a subset configuration as floating windows (on top of anything else), or be expanded out to offer full functionality. I find it handy to access a pop-up calculator or the quick Note applet without disturbing my main task/s. My favourite is the Task Manager, which also manages RAM.\n\nThe front-facing speakers on the Note make for much better sound than the rear-facing speakers on the Xoom. With the Xoom, watching a video requires the volume to be turned up quite loud. Even then, the sound from the speakers appears to be detached and low-fi. I sometimes remedy this with headphones or cupping my hands over the speakers to feed the sound towards the front. Neither \"solution\" is as good as having front-mounted speakers.\n\nThe inclusion of an IR emitter is a nice feature, but a bit of a gimmick (for me, at least). Coupled with the Peel Smart Remote application, you can supposedly turn your tablet into a smart remote. Although I haven't thoroughly tested this feature, it appears to be reasonably functional. Nevertheless, it seems limited to just one system. So I can't set it up to control both the home theatre as well as the TV in my office.\n\nBecause I would never use a tablet (nor a phone) camera for photography, if I can help it, I won't go into too much detail about the cameras in the Note. Except to say they are \"adequate\". I mainly use the rear camera with the CamScanner HD application and the front one for Skype.\n\nOn the negative side, I must mention the proprietary USB/Charging connector. Apparently the output from a PC USB port isn't enough to charge the Note (which I can understand). So, when you have it connected to a PC for extended data transfer periods, you can't charge it at the same time. At least I can do this with the Xoom, as it has a separate charging socket. I would expect proprietary connectors as part of the draconian iApple ecosystem, but Android devices should all have standard USB ports and separate power sockets. As a workaround, I use the brilliant Airdroid application while the tablet sits in its charging cradle.\n\nAnother negative is the lack of accessories currently available (early October 2012). Because the Note has slightly different dimensions to the Tab 2 10.1, most of the clip-on cases and the keyboard dock do not fit. I guess this will change over time.\n\nDespite the slow appearance of accessories for the Note, many of the apps that are suited to a stylus have already been updated to take advantage of the S-Pen's precision. These include Quill and Autodesk Sketchbook Pro, but not Skitch (but who uses that, anyway?). In addition, the excellent Photoshop Touch supports the S-Pen and comes preloaded (with a licence) and really does showcase the benefits of a decent stylus.\n\nIn conclusion, the Note has features that considerably increase the usefulness of a tablet for me. This is mainly because the extra features are actually what I wanted; NONE of which are available on any comparable device."}

I debated between an Ipad and the Note, and the features of the Note wowed me!  The Ipad seemed to me to be rather limited in its capabilities, simplistic, really.\n\nI did worry, however, about the comments I had read about the Note's screen resolution, that it didn't measure up to the Ipad's.  Well, I've got to say, that on a 10\" screen, I'm not sure how OBVIOUS a difference there is between the two.  Blow up the screen to a 13\" + size, and, then the difference would be clear.\n\nSo, the s-pen is fabulous.  Feel it skim across the screen.  A delight!  Still haven't figured out the programs included, but I'm new to the tablet world, so the learning process is a positive challenge for me!\n\nI ordered a gel cover for the back of the Note.  From what I read, the glass is quite resistant to scratches.  Will see how the gel works when it arrives.\n\nAlso, just read yesterday (Oct. 8, 2012), that Consumer Reports gave the Note 10.1 a RAVE review.  That's a comforting sign.\n\nSo, with that comment, I'll say, do your homework about the Note 10.1.  Go to a store (Best Buy) and play with it.  Compare it to the Ipad.  Which one FEELS right for you?  And if you purchase the Note 10.1, make SURE that the two seals on the box are intact.  (My first purchase had been opened, repacked and sold as a new device! Best Buy)\n\nOne question for you all:  If my gel cover doesn't pan out, what product did you purchase and would you RECOMMEND to protect your Note 10.1?\n\nSign me,\n\nAmazon Woman"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "So far it is everything I would hope for in a Pen based tablet.\n\nThe productivity apps that are packaged with the Tablet are decent, but not amazing.\n\nThe Pen integration is excellent, and once customized with a set of apps to your liking, everything works wonderfully.\n\nThe top customizations I recommend:\n\nSwype Beta app over the default Samsung keyboard.  The word matching in Swype is significantly better.\n\nPapyrus over S-Note. The vector based drawing and minimalistic Android-centric interface is excellent. The one thing I would add is in-line photo/video capture. That said, the formula entry capabilities of S-Note are amazing, as is the integration with Wolfram Alpha. If I get to crunching integrals at some point, I could definitely see a nice reason to dive back in to S-Note.\n\nChrome browser over the Samsung provided browser.\n\nGMail app over the built in Mail app (provided that you mostly use GMail of course...)\n\nThe multi-screen apps are only the Samsung native ones, and really, I didn't find the feature to add much to the tablet experience.\n\nPROS:\nSpeedy and responsive under normal use.\n\nNice beautifully bright screen.\n\nThe S-Pen is 100% undiluted awesome and solves the digital lab-notebook problem I've had since forever.\n\nThe face-tracking to stay awake function is actually quite amazing and a very nice touch.\n\nCONS:\nTablet would be straight up awesome and amazing if only they had gone for the high resolution screens that Samsung manufactures, as it stands, I know that I'll be purchasing the high-res version as an upgrade once its available.\n\nAuto-dimming is fairly idiotic in is response to the environment.\n\nA fair amount of the default software is unnecessary fluff. The Samsung App/Music/Whatever store is an odd addition. However, in some sense its nice to see that Google supports a diversity of App vendors in the Android universe whole heartedly."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Like many others, i read the horrid initial reviews spitting out the viral misinformation about this tablet and although i was interested in it, i almost dismissed it and continued to search for another tablet. I'm glad i didn't after reading actual USER reviews, and forums such as xda developers give much more enlightened information.\n\nAlthough i am still getting my feet wet after just a few days of ownership, i am very happy with my investment.\nThis tablet is the perfect bridge for me between a smart phone and desktop, and in many ways adds functions that even a highend desktop is incapable of, in particular the stylus s-pen input. Personally i wanted to be able to use the device for drawing and photo manipulation, as i am a photographer/graphic artist. Is it perfect? No, but ive been using Photoshop since about vs. 1 and seen it grow by bounds. PS Touch is still an infant, but is usable, it can only get much better with updates and new versions.\n\nIf the prospect of writing drawing and input with a pen is not for you, then by all means maybe you should look for an alternative with a \"better\" screen. The pen input is the whole point (pun intended) of this device, and even though this is new to tablet tech, it works quite well. I have used a Wacom input tablet for years on my destop, but was always frustrated by the hand on tablet while looking at monitor issues. As an artist being able to draw on the device is so much more intuitive, precise, and FUN...the way it should be. Thats not to say there is not a learning curve with the softwares. But being able to bring a device this size with you anywhere and draw paint etc, without a bevy of actual paint tubes, pencils, other medium, is just amazing. The software is somewhat limited as yet, but is still useable and should only get better as developers and users realize how useful and desirable this can be. I am using Touch as well as Autodesk Sketchbook, Infinite Paint/Design, FrescoPro, among others so far.\n\nThe battery life is just amazing...this thing can literally go all day long. If you don't use it continuously all day it can last for days without charging.\n\nDoes it feel cheaply made? Not to me. But im more concerned with what i can use it for instead of the look or color of the shell or the brand logo emblazed on it. Seems quite sturdy and mine doesnt creak in my hands.\n\nI got the 16gb version as it was readily available, and i added a 64gb card to the slot, for less than the $50 extra for the 32g model. Thank you so much for adding the card slot, Samsung!\n\nThe audio quality is very good. The builtin speakers are great for their size, lack bass, but have clean clarity. The actual output is very good though. Ive read that the opamp is made by Wolfson but cant confirm, it is comparable to the SQ of the GalaxyNexus phone though. My preferred music player is PowerAmp (amazing sq and user tweaking).\n\nWifi and Bluetooth work very well. Great signal with good range. No problems connecting to any bt devices so far. Have also used my Epson 645 to print from tablet wirelessly.\n\nEmail and browser apps work great as does the Multiscreen with limited but useful apps.\nThis review was written using the Note with the on-screen keyboard.\n\nI will try to update with more information as i use the Note more. So far i am extremely happy with this tablet!\n\n*** UPDATE (10-7-2012):\n\nStill loving my Note.\nAm using several art apps successfully on the tablet, including AutoDesk SketchBook (i'm using the full paid version), Infinite Painter, FrescoPro, and ZenBrush.\nSo far, really like it. The S-pan is pretty precise and i think there are a good many levels of gradation/pressure sensitivity.\nPS Touch is usable for editing photos on the fly. \"NexusMediaImporter\" is a great app for dowloading raw files into your Note.\nYou will need this or similar adapter, which works quite well for the cheap price:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005YWIRBS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00\n(Sanoxy Female USB OTG adapter) which allows you to hook up a flash card reader or a USB thumb drive to your tablet. With the app you can see your files and download them into the tablet from the card or drive. I use the app on my smartphone as well (GalaxyNexus) to be able to able and transmit photos out of my DSLR in the field (i'm a photojournalist), and it works quite well.\nIf you have read the comments, you'll see that a 64gb sd card will work great in the Note 10.1, AFTER the latest ICS upgrade to 4.04. Otherwise, you will need to reformat some of the newer cards that come formatted in the exFAT format to FAT32. But if you are just getting your Note, i would suggest waiting until you get the update before using the card so you can just use the exFAT format.\nMy particular card is a Sandisk \"MobileUltra\" SDXC card with a Class10 rating. It works great in the Note, and i have over 50gb of content on it, including music (MP3) and photo (JPG) files.\nI have also opened text files, including MS WORD documents, that will successfully open using the included PolarisOffice app on the Note, and are then editable in Polaris ;) which seems to be a very nice included software on the tablet.\n\nAlso, i just don't understand the reviews, comments on the Note's so-called horrid screen resolution. It seems quite sharp to me. No, it doesnt have the 'HD' resolution of some newer devices, but it is my no means bad. It is punchy with good blacks and looks plenty sharp at the normal viewing distance of a 10\" screen. I have also downloaded and am using different fonts, with i think look even sharper to my eyes.\nThe Note10.1 is a nice tablet for the price, and is quite functional to actually DO THINGS with. Until the MS Surface tablets appear and we see how well the new Win8 touch interface works, S-pen is among the very best interfaces for writing and art there is at the moment, and the price is quite reasonable for this technology.\n\n***UPDATE 10-19-2012\nA few more comments with more use:\nThe Polaris app will view, open, edit files including Word, PDF, etc., and is a very useful and well developed app.\nThe sound quality of this device is very good, particularly when using apps such as PowerAmp to tweak the sound.\nBattery life is EXCELLENT, i can use the Note for generally 2-3 days of use (with at least 2-3 hours a day) before a recharge.\nReading works well on the Note as well, including Kindle, Aldiko, Nook, and YouVersion apps. Also using some digital magazine subscriptions.\n\nAs i almost waited for the release of MS Surface, with the price now being known to be $600 (with the keybord cover), i am happy i didnt. That's for the RT version, not the full Win8 version to be released next year, with a much higher price to be announced.\nAnd the Note's touch interface with S-pen is i'm sure still a more advanced input, as well as the limited app availability for WindowsRT at the moment."}

I can play a youtube or any other type of video and have float around the screen while I surf the web or check e-mail.

One thing is that I love the multi-tasking capability as this was was one of the few things I've kept away from tablets all this time. Being an IT Manager, I'm a power user and I've tried 3 different tablets including an iPad. Out of those tablets I've used in the past, the iPad came close to being my main device to manage an infrastructure when I'm away but still wasn't a true \"multi-tasking\" device.\n\nAnd then I saw this device and heard and seen the capabilities and I can see myself connected to my email and having my browser up and running on the other end and managing my servers through the browser. Now I didn't get the Note 10.1 from Amazon but through my Vendor but thought I would share my experience anyways.\n\nOne thing that was a flaw from the moment I opened and turned it on is that my screen had a pretty decent size of a cluster of dead pixels. So I'll be exchanging it immediately. I did think about getting the Asus Infinity TF700 but was hearing LOTS of flaws and Quality of the design.  So hopefully my Note is just a small flaw and a replacement isn't going to have the same problem, otherwise the device is very speedy and with 2GB of Ram, should be some sort of future proof.\n\nI would definitely consider and recommend this product to anyone who are multi-task.

Skype crashes on any device I use at some point.\n\n7. The speakers are loud and front facing, woo-hoo! I still think they could be louder on tablets but this design is a\n  good start.\n\n8. I dislike the proprietary dock. A standard port would have been appreciated for many reasons.\n\n9. The camera takes nice pictures. Screen shot function is also good.\n\n10. I dislike the screenshot shortcut on the menu bar. Since the last OTA, Power + VolUp also gives screenshot. I want\n  the option to remove that shortcut.\n\n11. Unit takes a long time to charge. Haven't timed it, but I guess maybe 3 hours.\n\n12. No issues with Wi-Fi like some people have reported.\n\n13. I want Jelly Bean. I have been to xda forums and an UNofficial Jelly Bean update is available for the 3G version.\n  Dev is also quiet at the moment, they are also probably waiting on JB.\n\nWith all that I have said here, this is my tablet of choice for a couple reasons:\n\n1. It is gorgeous\n\n2. The display is nice and bright\n\n3. Speed\n\n4. Best darn tablet for using a digital pen."}

Web browsing is very comfortable.  It's great for videos - the stereo speakers are very good.\n\nThe main feature - the s-pen is just great.  I've been using it to take notes at meetings, is actually better than a regular notebook, because you can erase stuff without making a mess...pressure recognition is a very cool thing, great for drawing.  I'm a post-graduate student, so I've also been using this to study - there's a tool in adobe reader that allows you to highlight and write on pdf files.  Perfect.\n\nI was getting afraid because i saw a bunch of reviews that showed this device as a very fragile thingm, due to the plastic body...I can't complain, mine feels very solid and well built.\n\nI can certainly recommend this tablet.\n\nMy only complaint is the screen resolution - not the greatest, if we compare to the pixel density of iphones, ipads and my current phone, a galaxy nexus - but it's not bad either."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I've been waiting, hoping, buying, trying and returning tablets ever since my initial (disappointing) foray with the ipad 2, just hoping that I might find one with the potential to serve as a digital sketchbook- not necessarily something where I could do a finished piece mind you, more just something I could take to the coffee shop and break free of my little home office doing homework. There was only one Android tablet that came close- the Lenovo Thinkpad tablet- but its Ntrig stylus left quite a bit to be desired. As for tablet PC's with Wacom interfaces the lack of pressure sensitivity levels and general bulkiness and need to carry around a charger and bluetooth keyboard (I'm kind of a hotkey glutton when it comes to photoshop)made sketching on good old fashioned paper and scanning it a lot more appealing.\n\nThis one finally hit the mark. Thanks, Samsung, for being the first company to really acknowledge the creative community and get together with Wacom.\n\nIs this going to replace a full fledged cintiq or intuos tablet? I don't think so. What it lacks in sensitivity and support for fully featured apps though it more than makes up for in portability.\n\nOne aspect that I am a bit disappointed with is the included Photoshop touch app. It seems quite robust as a photo editor for android but it misses the mark in terms of drawing and painting. The brush controls just aren't there- which kind of me wonder why they didn't bundle the imminently more applicable sketchbook pro instead."}

Almost a year ago I bought the Lenovo Thinkpad tablet and while the hardware was very good quality, the software was the let down, also the tegra 2 cpu just couldn't handle the HD mkv movies. I eventually sold it as I was rarely using it. When I saw the specs of the Galaxy Note 10.1 it looked like the answer to my tablet needs.\n\nThe tablet's pros:\n- very fast performing general operations eg. opening apps & navagating around the O/S\n- able to play the HD .mkv movies (it can even stream them from my server), which the tegra 2 cpus struggled with\n- very good at multitasking using the including multitasking apps\n- excellent at note taking using both the built in s-note app and Quill\n- long battery life (only had to charge it once or so a week)\n- nice loud stereo speakers\n\nCons:\n- no HD screen; although the screen isn't bad, given the price of the tablet and how this is a flagship model it should have come with a higher resolution screen like its competitors from Asus and Apple\n- build quality; again while not bad, it just doesnt feel like a $500US tablet with all the plastic.\n- design of the pen and placement in the tablet; the pen is a little too slim and short and it is very easy to put it in wrong in the tablet slot.\n\nIf you are looking to upgrade your last gen tablet or even purchase one for the first time, the Note 10.1 is a good place to start."}

Finally got rid of it, but still thought that 7\" was the sweet spot...used to laugh at people who lugged heavy iPads (although in terms of graphics they were smooth as hell) or equally heavy 10\" Android tablets around.\nA year back, I discovered the Note (still my main phone) and the magic of the stylus, thought the screen a bit too small to really draw anything.\nFor scribbling notes it was fine.\n\nUnsuspectingly I wandered into a Samsung showroom over a month back and started playing around with the Note 10.1.\nCouldn't believe it.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I am happy to see how 'we' aka the users or 'consumers' (hate that term) are driving the evolution of tablets and similar gadgets. The near-complete dominance of the one-size-fits-all, general-purpose tablet is about to end and more of us have the ability to pick something that more closely matches what we want or what we need in the favorite feature set, screen size and level of affordability. And the Note 10.1 is one such example. It's not for everyone but if you are looking for a highly portable tool to not only consume content or shop or play games but also to create media, especially visual media, the Note 10.1 is probably the best choice at this time.\n\nSPECS\n\nNothing to be shy about when it comes to powerful hardware.\n\n- 1.4GHz quad-core CPU (fast)\n- 2GB of RAM\n- WXGA display, 1280 x 800 LCD (not the best but good enough)\n- 16/32GB built-in storage\n- MicroSD for further storage expansion\n- USB 2.0\n- mHL port for directly connecting to HD TVs\n- Bluetooth 3.0 for connecting any of a number of possible peripherals such as speakers or keyboards\n- Wi-Fi 802.11N\n- Wi-Fi Direct (connect to other devices without the need of a wireless access point\n- 1.9M front camera\n- 5M rear camera\n- stereo speakers (impressive)\n\nPerformance is impressive. Response is almost immediate, the tablet responds well to either finger, stylus or its own pen. As the enumeration above shows, this tablet has almost everything and most of it is top notch. Yes, you can find better displays on other tablets but I am quite content with what the Note provides.\n\nTHE PEN\n\nThe difference the pen makes is the difference between finger painting and using a fine paintbrush or pencil. The Note's pen allows for precise control, the tablet responds to its touch instantly and with the proper software you can do more neat things with it than you can possibly imagine before you actually try it. I found the pen to be comfortable to hold and it's the preferred input method for the Note.\n\nIf you want to do any serious drawing or painting on a tablet, the Note 10.1 is likely to be the number one choice, thanks to its S Pen. It's a lot more than a stylus. Its thin tip allows you to touch the screen with almost pixel-level precision and the the tablet recognizes not only the tip's position but also the amount of pressure you apply. This makes all the difference when it comes to drawing or painting. Additional capabilities are unlocked in S Pen-aware apps trough by pressing a button on the pen's side.\n\nSOFTWARE\n\nIt's impressive how well integrated Samsung's own apps and customized interface blend with the base Android foundation. Samsung's interface and the 4-core processor allow you to truly multitask - as in have 2 apps sharing the screen - certain compatible apps. For example, you can play a video on one half of the screen and run a browser and do your email on the other half.\n\nThe Note shines when running Samsung developed or third-party apps that are S Pen compatible. There's quite a few of them including an amazing custom version PhotoShop Touch. Samsung's own S Note allows you to take hand-written notes, can guess many basic shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles) that you may try to draw and replace them with perfect outlines. There's a number of S Pen apps on Google Play.\n\nOne of the more intriguing apps was Kno Textbook aimed at students whose titles come with full multimedia features, from illustration to animations, 3-D models and video and they claim to have thousands of titles available for purchase.\n\nWHO SHOULD CONSIDER IT?\n\nAnyone who can afford the price and is an artist by profession or by hobby should at least consider the Note 10.1. Students may be interested because of the tablet's note-taking capabilities and the Kno Textbook app. Also, anyone who, like me, doesn't particularly enjoy touching their tablet screen.\n\nI will be rating the Note 10.l as a five-star in the context of it providing the specific features and capabilities I described below. As a general-purpose tablet is simply one of many - good quality build if you don't mind all-plastic, powerful specs at the time I write this but may not look so powerful one year from now, likely to get Android upgrades eventually. As an artist or would-be artist tablet or a student's, it's one of the best."}

I thought the speed and display were good, but the OS is highly customized, and the S-pen is a joke right now. If you are a graphic designer (and can tolerate the lower res screen) then maybe, but I didn't buy my tablet to doodle. I bought it to use the multi-windows option, and write emails, etc with the S-pen. The multitasking only lets you choose form 5 or 6 pre-determined programs, you cannot customize this list...lame. SO if you had a favorite pdf reader you wanted to view side by side with chrome (etc.), doesn't work (only the base internet browser and something like Polaris office). The s-pen seems cool in concept, but doesn't work in Gmail (only the Samsung email client through a copy and paste type function), and the S-note app is nothing special, in my opinion, there are better free versions of similar apps available. Feels cheap, as others have said (so did the Samsung/Verizon Galaxy nexus..must be a Samsung thing?), and it is really loaded with bloatware.\n\nI would say pass on this, and wait for something a bit more functional to come out. You won't be missing anything."}

I am a lover of technology, however.  That being said, I am always on the look out for bigger and better gadgets/technology.  When I decided to get rid of my paper Franklin Planner, which I've been using for 15 years now, I wanted something that would fit my business needs (this is the only way I can justify buying another tablet since I already owned the Kindle Fire!)  After much research on the net and You Tube, I decided to go with the Samsung Note.  The first reason was that I thought this tablet was geared more towards business than the Ipad, which seemed to be more geared towards multimedia.  (Obviously both tablets are can easily handle work and entertainment demands)  The second reason, I went with Samsung is because it is Android based and I am wanted that freedom/option vs. being forced to get everything from the Apple Store.  Don't get me wrong, the Ipad 3 is AMAZING and an excellent tablet and if money was no object, I would have own both the Samsung Note and the Ipad 3!  I'm just particular about the flexibility of my buying options.\n\nWhat I love about the Note is that you can easily take handwritten notes and have it turned into text immediately and pretty accurately.  Love the S pen!  I also love being able to write formulas that are easily identified by the program.  My husband is a math teacher so this function is great for him.  He is able to write his math tests for his students quickly and neatly on the go while he is waiting for our boys to finish soccer or Taekwondo practice.  We are still learning how to use all the functions and there is a learning curve involved.  If your handwriting is too sloppy, the program will not capture it correctly.  If you have decent penmanship, it works pretty well.\n\nThe Note is amazingly fast and I notice that it downloads faster than my laptop.  I can surf the net easily and can download and upload anything I need it to in record time.  Very impressed with the speed.  I am sure I am just scratching the surface of all the Tablet has to offer and it has been fun discovering them!\n\nI've been using it for two weeks now and have no complaints. It is attractive (I have the white one), fast, lightweight and user friendly!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Okay, so ever since I saw the commercial for this product, I knew I HAD to have one...and not the commercial with James Franco. Screw James Franco and his multi-tasking.\n\nAnyway, I was really excited for 3 main features: Kno (the textbook app), handwritten notes (S Note) and illustrating (Photoshop Touch).\n\nAfter using the tablet all day, I have discovered the following:\n\n1) Handwritten notes work pretty well, but S Note is not the best program. Samsung could have done better. The pages for handwritten notes are tiny, and you have to add new pages to write more. I find this annoying. BONUS: You can add photos and voice recordings into the notes, which is awesome, especially for students (which I am).\n\n2) Photoshop Touch is disappointing. An actual graphic designer/illustrator probably wouldn't find much use for the program. Also, the S Pen is a disappointing size and would be better if larger. I think Samsung is lying about the 1024 pressure sensitivity of the S Pen, also - at least when using Photoshop Touch. Maybe I was using it wrong, but holy crap did I have to press hard to get the pressure sensitivity to register correctly.\n\n3) Kno is a really awesome program, and I like it that I can load PDF files from DropBox and write little notes on them and stuff. I don't have any complaints about this program.\n\nOther things I have noticed:\n\n1) The tablet comes with a bunch of pre-loaded crap that I can't uninstall. I HATE THIS. I'm annoyed that in order to uninstall it, I'd have to root the phone, which screws up the warranty and future Android OS updates.\n\n2) Sometimes it's slow in registering screen touch. This is pretty universal, so I'm not going to be pissy about it.\n\n3) The tablet has FANTASTIC speakers (loud and clear).\n\n4) Skype app for Android works really well!\n\n5) The rear-facing camera takes really decent images!\n\n6) The customization and many screens/widgets/apps is really phenomenal. You can download from Android Market (Play Store) and the Samsung Store, which is really neat. I also love the Media Hub where I can buy movies. :)\n\n7) The Smart Remote (for use with Cable and TV) was SUPER EASY to set up and worked immediately with my TV (a Samsung, go figure). However, I had to mess around with the channel line up because for some reason, the Smart Remote gave me channels I didn't have. Overall awesome though.\n\n8) The internet browser is fast and full screen. Using this tablet is very similar to using a laptop, which I really love. It is extremely portable. Speaking of portable - the video capabilities of this thing for AMAZING!\n\nAnyway - my overall assessment is: I LOVE THIS TABLET. It does everything I need it to do and more. :)"}

I stay with Apple products mainly because Mac does the best for what I do. However, I never have been 100% satisfied with iPhone & iPad due to their unnecessary restrictions and limitations. I just couldn't find alternatives - I love Android in terms of features and potential, but the execution(overall user experience) has been lagging.\n\nI guess that the time has come. Galaxy Note 10.1 made big step forward and turned the potential into reality. Just after 48 hours learning and playing around, I am convinced this is the device I want to use everyday. It is the first tablet that actually helps my productivity, no more frustration with restricted toy. So iPad goes to my mom now.\n\nI won't relist pros and cons, since all reviewers already listed them. But I just want to correct a few misconceptions that some biased online reviewers manufactured.\n\n1. Some people lie about build quality and they claim it makes squeaky sound when they grap it. Either they got the defect or it is downright lie. It feels solid and much better material for everyday use. Aluminum on my iPad may \"look\" better, but not practical without cover or case. I always had to use cover for my iPad to prevent scratches. But if you have to use case to cover, what's the point? It covers \"beautiful\" aluminum anyway. I don't even use cover/case for Galaxy Note and it feels just right in many hours use. Again, this two tone design(mine is white-silver) looks beautiful, very comfortable for many hours. This tablet is designed to work, not just look.\n\n2. Screen - screen resolution is one of the reasons I was hesitant to try Galaxy Note. All I can say is just go try it yourself. This screen is beautiful! Yes you heard this from the owner who use Retina Macbbok Pro and 27 iMac everyday. Do not fall into john doe's resolution comparison, just go check it yourself! Sure 1920 would be nice, but I'd take  Galaxy's 1280 with S-Pen any day.\n\n3. Some say it's expensive. Do you know how much it cost to buy wacom device with this size and feature alone?\n\nMost importantly, this tablet is so fast and responsive and delivers many things in my wish list \"today\". No more compromising and stuck with iPad. S-Pen, true multitasking (yes limited as of now, but it's already very powerful and useful), and microSD support (I feel like a prisoner who just escaped from Alcatraz!).  I suggest you to check this device yourself and never fall into some online reviews.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I still love Apple products and I will stay with Mac unless I see something better for my life and work. I just wanted to share my experience with Galaxy Note 10.1 because there are so many false reviews from Apple or Android fan boys and girls.\n\n*** I strongly recommend you to watch all SAMSUNGmobile's YouTube videos to utilize Galaxy to its full potential. You will see why I think no other tablets can even compete with Galaxy Note. ***\n\nOne more thing...I know my next phone will be Samsung Galaxy Note II."}

It did not disappoint.\n\nFirstly, this tablet is fast, really fast. Handling is smooth, and applications open quickly. Many of the application that I have on my galaxy note phone I've also installed on my tablet, and they move much more briskly on the tablet.\n\nSecondly, although the tablet is made up of plastic, it does not feel cheap, and feels quite robust. I'll still avoid dropping it though. I also expected it to be a little lighter than it is, but this is not a big deal for me.\n\nThe S-Pen also works much better on the tablet. It is much more responsive when taking handwritten notes, and the larger pen does feel better.\n\nMy one major qualm with the tablet is that you cannot move apps to the SD card like I am able to with my galaxy note phone. I purchased the 16 gig version of the tablet along with a 32 gig SD card for just that purpose, only to find out that I can't do that. If I had known that, I would've purchased the 32 gig version of the tablet.\n\nOverall, I think that this is an excellent tablet, and there's a lot of potential.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Ok, pretty much the only reason i bought the Galaxy Note 10.1 over other similar tablets was because of the S-pen, so my review is going to deal mostly with that. Keep in mind that this is my first tablet and i am new to android.\n\nFirst of all, the S-pen is very accurate and works great. After using a Wacom Bamboo for many years i would say that the s-pen lives up to my expectations. It is precise and the pressure sensitivity works very well. I can't say that i notice all 1024 levels while using it, but it does have a nice range of sensitivity.\n\nPros:\n- The multitasking is great, and so is the pop-out video player.\n- Screen looks amazing (even with the lower, 1200x800 resolution)\n- S-pen is awesome, the tip is small enough to allow you to be really accurate.\n- Sketching and drawing/painting on this tablet is fantastic, especially after Autodesk&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SketchBook-Pro/dp/B00A7Z8KAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SketchBook Pro</a>&nbsp;was updated, amazing app that i highly recommend.\n- Taking notes on it is a breeze, the only tablets that can even come close to comparing to it are the Windows 8 tablets with Wacom digitizers, but they are much more expensive.\n- The peel app makes controlling your T.V. or home theater system quite convenient.\n- Battery life is outstanding.\n\nCons:\n- The fact that it's made out of plastic doesn't bother me, but some people might care. It looks good and is pretty sturdy either way.\n- A bit pricey, considering the screen resolution is so much less than other tablets in the same price range, but the S-pen is the trade off.\n- Does not have a mini HDMI port built-in. After owning the tablet for 5 months this is the one thing i really wish it had. In order to connect this to a HDTV or other TV you have to buy a separate adapter, and you have to have the tablet plugged into a power source:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-EPL-3PHPBEGXAR-Galaxy-Tab-HDTV-Adapter/dp/B005TLKR1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung EPL-3PHPBEGXAR Galaxy Tab HDTV Adapter</a>\n Very annoying and inconvenient, but the only real downfall of the entire tablet.\n\nIn Conclusion:\nI would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone, especially if you will make good use of the s-pen with taking notes, drawing, or anything else. The quality of the product is very nice.\n\nOn a side note, I you need the Full Pro version of Autodesk Sketchbook to be able to use pressure sensitivity, the free version (express) doesn't have this. But the tablet comes with Photoshop PS Touch which has full pressure sensitivity support.\n\nThe tablet does have a couple downfalls (the screen resolution is a little low, but it still looks nice even with lower resolution). And the android 4.1.2 update increased the amount of apps that you can run in multi-window mode, so that is no longer an issue. The human eye (someone with great vision) can recognize a dpi of up to 300. Apple uses a number very close to this in their Retina displays, but no one is holding the device right up to their face to use it. Having 150 dpi is still on the higher end of things. To put that into perspective, my full HD 21\" 1080p monitor that i am looking at right now has an excellent display at 105 dpi, granted i do sit further away from it than a tablet. A typical laptop (15.6\" at 1366 x 768) only has 75 dpi and no one is complaining.\n\n****EDIT:**** I've had the tablet for just over 5 months now and i am still very satisfied with this tablet, even after seeing all the Windows 8 tablets out there i would still buy this one."}

I am a grad student, pre-medical, and have my own business as a private tutor and this tablet is the answer to my needs.  My students love how easy it is for me to share concepts with them by drawing with the S pen.  At first I didn't love the browser, but after downloading a fully functional Google chrome app my speed was 10 times better and it works great.  The stylus is very handy and it's great that putting your hand down on the tablet does not interfere with your writing.  I've been using the formula to text option on the S note app where I write out the algebra 2 formulas I need to show them and they are instantly and accurately translated to text.\nSmall things that have made the difference for me: when I try to click on something in a web browser it will enlarge the section I was clicking if there were multiple links, allowing me to select the correct one.  The battery life has been great and switching from screen to screen or zooming is very fast.\nDefinitely the right choice for students and android users- my students that I tutor who have ipads are jealous."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "It is a pretty descent tablet, I will say that. I saw the James Franco commercial and immediately decided to buy it. I cant say I want to keep it though because of a couple of problems that make this tablet a joke.\n\nThe most significant is the quality of materials. Go online, and look at pictures or videos of the material up close and you will see that it looks soooo cheap. For a $500 tablet, this is inexcusable. The plastic actually bends and creaks when you press it down. I guess that isn't too bad, so long as it works. But at $500, that is a slap in the face. I really believe this tablet won't last at $500 for too long.\n\nThe second big problem is the screen resolution. It is horrible for this generation of tablets, specially from a flagship product from a company that manufactures the iPad screens. It not aweful screen but its not what you pay for at $500. trust me,DO NOT BUY THIS.\n\n*Extra info: I bought this device at a local ELECTRONICS store because I was on the fence about buying it. I wasn't satisfied after using it for a couple of days so I had to return it. Now, I am not saying its not a good device, it is fine. But the two things that are holding it back, in my opinion is the cheap build quality and screen res. If you bought and are saying those are somethings you can overlook or live with, more power to you. But to those people I also ask, wouldnt it be much better, or wouldnt you feel like you got your money's worth more if it had a solid metal backing, or maybe even a better screen res? You cant tell me that the metal would have made it way heavier because I was upgrading from my asus transformer prime, which had an aluminum back and was super light. Also, if you never went a store, just saw the pictures online, you would think that it actually was made of some solid metal. The back has that brushed metal texture look, so you could tell that the designers were going for that, deceptive as it might be. Now you can tell me that its not cheap plastic, that it might even be some super polymer or what ever but to me it felt cheap. And even if higher res screens are overrated, I don't see why a $500 device wouldnt have one.\n\nAnd all of this would be fine if it weren't for the ridiculous price tag. My point is just this, for $500, which what HIGH END tablets are going for, I would expect a little better. I had a xoom first, then I upgraded to a transformer primer. But since I am a college student, I really wanted a stylus capable device. That is something this tablet does well, I will admit. My argument is that people shouldnt buy this because I believe that doing so would show Samsung they cant pull this kind of move. I sincerely believe they could have built a better tablet than this (at the price they are asking for it)."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I like this tablet because it comes with stylus, good pressure sensitivity and taking notes with it is extremely easy and beautiful. I take two stars away because its Android is not 4.1 yet (it is 4.0.4), also, unlike Linux and Windows, it doesn't come with native keyboard for Middle East languages like Farsi and Arabic. After fixing these two problems, I will change three stars to five stars. Just a note, when producing products for masses, you are not producing tanks and jet fighters, you better forget politics and war. Ordinary people are not politicians."}

I even tried a different model of the tablet to see if the production run was bad on the 32gb version but it was the same on the 64gb version... QC was TERRIBLE and I could not spend that much money on a tablet and be \"okay\" with the defects they had. Anyways, I waited awhile and read some reviews and finally purchased this one at my local BB and let me tell you that I am glad I did!! I don't regret this purchase at all and it has ZERO defects on my first try!! (YAY) While I did want a better screen resolution I found that it's still a very nice screen. I don't read too much so it does not bother me but what is THE BEST is how this tablet is super speedy!! It kills the Infinity in Horsepower as far as I am concerned and the benchmarks as well... I am still getting used to it as I just purchased it but will update my review shortly and go over the pro's and cons. Just thought I would give my initial impressions for people on the fence looking to buy this or the Infinity and this is MY pick for sure!!  :)\n\nEDIT: I have used this tablet for quite awhile now and I am 99% satisfied!! I thought possibly something would go wrong but this thing just keeps me wanting more! I take it everywhere with me now and nobody seems to know what I have and I get a lot of comments when I start writing on it... LOL  I just tell people to order one cause they won't be disappointed...\n\nPROS- Very FAST!!, You can multitask without too many hiccups!, Build quality is great even though it's \"plastic\"!, Did I say FAST???, You can write on this bad boy!!, 2gb of ram!!\n\nCONS- Needs a higher resolution screen to keep up with the competition although I think it's in a category of it's own! :) Come on Samsung, use at least some aluminum... ;)\n\nI will NOT be returning this and I am glad I did not keep the CRAPPY QC Infinity cause now I am finally happy!! THANK YOU SAMSUNG!!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "The Note 10.1 packs some impressive specs and features and makes the best case for a stylus yet.  Although the display is colorful and vivid, the resolution lags other tablets in this price class like the Asus Transformer Pad Infinity and the iPad (3rd Gen).  While I like this tablet, there are many pros and cons to consider.\n\nPros:\nSpeakers: Stereo speakers which face the user make this the best sounding tablet by far!\nDisplay: Vivid and colorful IPS LCD screen with no light-bleeding at the edges\nS-Pen:  Stylus based on WACOM tech is far more accurate and versatile than capacitive based pens on standard touch screens which adds things such as pressure sensitivity and proximity awareness.  The handwriting recognition tech works remarkably well, but you have to be patient and careful in practice.\nFeatures and Customization:  Samsung's TouchWiz UX brings a ton of features and customization, including side-by-side windowing and a pop-out video player.\nDesign: The tablet feels very comfortable in the hand with nice rounded edges.  I also like the two-tone white and silver plastics, the white in particular has a nice pearlescent finish.\nSpecs: Some impressive internal specs with 2GBs of RAM\n\nCons:\nDisplay: Screen resolution is very low compared to the competition which makes this poor for reading text.\nConstruction: All plastic construction which creeks and flexes to a small degree.\nPerformance: Despite it's impressive specs, the tablet is noticeably laggy in all aspects of its operation.  The complexity of TouchWiz and the variety of features contribute to this problem and might be cured with future updates (Jelly Bean).\nCamera:  The camera records video in 720p instead of 1080p, and takes mediocre stills.  Many tablet cameras are doing 1080p video.\nMultitasking: Side-By-Side windowing works only with Samsung apps, and the concept doesn't work that well in execution since you can't interact with both windows simultaneously."}

I've had these for a couple weeks now and absolutely love them.  Could they be better? Of course they could.  Could they be worse? Yes\n\nIt is very quick, looks really good, and has many great features.  My only complaints would be the lack of accessories available. . . . anywhere.  And, not being able to charge it from the car.  I've tried four different charge adapters ranging in power output and non of them work.\n\nUp time is excellent and as with my phone, always charge while I'm sleeping.  I added 64Gb cards to both of them and have several movies, lots of pics and hours of music to enjoy.  Like my computers, laptop & desktop, I don't save anything onto the on board drive, (16Gb).  Always save to external.\n\nThey are thin lightweight tablets that perform as advertised.  I'm happy with them and am thinking about a few more as Holiday gifts.\n\nUPDATE:  9/7/12  I updated the software on both of my Notes, White & Grey, and lost Flash Player on the White Note.  The Grey still has Flash.  Samsung suggested Factory Reset. . . Did not work.  No other fix available.  Samsung states they are working on a Flash Player alternative.  Note still works great otherwise.  Don't love it anymore, but still very infatuated, lol"}

Not only it is stereo, it is facing you, and it has plenty of volume to enjoy.\nThe thing that bothered me the most about the iPad2's speaker was that, not only is it mono, it is located on the back.\nIt bothered me to the point of searching and backing some \"Kickstarter\" project, so that I could redirect the sound from back to front.\nI was that desperate..\n\nS-PEN:\nS-Pen and PS Touch experience has been just amazing.\nIt is not perfect, but it made it possible where it was impossible before.\nI could actual do semi-serious photoshopping with it.\nThe S-Pen is pin-point accurate and the PS touch provided good set of tools, complete with good tutorials to acquaint myself.\nI hope one day, that I can work with RAW image files on this combo.\n\nMINI APPS:\nSome people think there aren't enough mini apps available. True, but I like to think in reverse.\nHaving them and not having them make a quite the difference in my opinion.\nThey are very handy, because they are popup apps that hovers over other app and can be moved around.\nIt is nice to clip things and take notes on them, without needing to hop and switch from one app to the other.\nThe whole process flows very well and naturally.\n\nPERFORMANCE (GAME):\nI think you will find plenty of youtube videos, demonstrating how well it can run some of the most heavy (CPU)hitting titles.\nMy gaming experience has been the same. This tablet will chew up those games like it was designed to be a gaming machine, and it can be and it is.\nAs of 8/30/2012, this tablet is the only tablet that I know that sports 2GB of memory.\nAlong with 1.4Ghz quad core Exynos processor, it packs some serious performance.\n\nPERFORMANCE (MULTITASK):\nThis is where that 2GB of memory shines.\nIf the internal storage space and micro SD card are the filing cabinets, the system memory is the desk.\nBigger the memory, bigger the surface area of the desk, where you can open more documents and lay them down, side by side.\nSince it has such a spacious(2GB) desk, it does not need to close already open documents to make room for new document to open.\nEvery time your device closes the document or app just to reopen them again later from scratch, it occupies that much more processor time and eats that much more battery power processing it.\nAlong with split-screen capability and pop up mini apps, multitasking on this tablet is A+.\n\nBATTERY LIFE:\nI do not always play games, or watch videos, but I do fair amount of them, and I am comfortable to say that I get 10+ hours, which is healthy amount. Charging time is around 3 hours if I let it go down to about 20%~30%.\n\nBUILT QUALITY:\nIt could be better. So does the iPad in difference aspects.\nHowever, it will get the job done of protecting it.\nJust don't drop it, hard.\nThen again, it is a fair game for other tablets too.\nIf you drop them hard, most of them will break just the same.\n\nREMINDER:\nI have couple of reminders.\n\n1st one is about the hidden goodies in Galaxy Note 10.1.\nThere are many small details and features that you probably do not know about.\nWhile they are not a game changer, they certainly make the tablet experience that much richer.\nSome of the things you want to look into are.. Display Screen modes (Dynamic, Standard & Movie), Motion features (Tilt to zoom, Pan to move icon & Pan to browse images), two fingers pinch in sweep over your on screen keyboard to change mode (Qwerty keyboard, Floating & Split), in Floating keyboard mode, if you touch the keyboard with two fingers for about 2 secs, you can relocate the keyboard to any area on the screen. There are many other hidden goodies, so google for tips and tricks.\n\n2nd one is about Jelly Bean update.\nSamsung is preparing for the Jelly Bean update.\nWhen that happens, you will get the latest Android OS, BUT you will lose the Adobe Flash Player.\nAdobe Dev. no longer supports Adobe Flash player for mobile version, so if you value your flash capability.. then ***DO NOT*** upgrade it to JB.\nRemain on ICS until HTML5 becomes majority. That is what I am going to do. ICS is just perfectly fine as it is for me."}

This tablet is great for handwriting and art.\n\nPros:\n* Handwriting recognition. The Note software with the S pen make handwriting a pleasure. Palm rejection is almost flawless. The Polaris software included may be even faster. Better yet, it converts to Word Format. If you have experience with gestures for handwriting recognition, you will benefit. Don't be fooled, it isn't perfect. Much depends on the quality of your handwriting.\n*Size & weight are fine. The rounded edges make the tablet easy to hold.\n*If you activate handwriting from the keyboard, it becomes the default input method, it becomes easy to fill out web forms, search requests, etc.\n* Tablet operations are smooth and fast. No stutter or drag.\n* Incredible battery life.\n* Edit - LAN access. Not possible with ipad. Our office network includes Linux servers and windows computers, with a wireless router inside the firewall. Using ES File Explorer, I can browse the entire network. Connect to the wireless router. Go to the LAN tab in ES File Explorer and allow it to scan for computers. Click on a Linux server (identified by I p address) and all files are available for download. Click on the file and it opens with the appropriate program.\n\nNeutral:\n* The screen resolution is less than Ipad 3, but it's clear. Automatic brightening works well for me, as does eye detection. I understand the resolution is limited by the Wacom tech.\n* The software is not as integrated as IPad, as expected for Android. To get the best use of the tablet required going thru settings to customize. Not bad if you know Android, but could be intimidating for novice users. It does allow you to make the machine your own. One of my first decisions involved setting up S pen settings, including pressure sensitivity and tip size.\n\nCon:\n*The built. It creaks if I hold it certain ways. It doesn't have the solidity of other tablets of equal cost. l will trade that for the S pen and just keep it in a case.\n* Default software needs improvement.. PDF doesn't work well inside S Note if it's large or landscape. Download EZPDF Reader to solve that. S Note is good, but I'm also trying Lecture Notes. The problems can be fixed.\n\nI recommend this tablet if you can take the time to learn it. There are lots of tools for the user to customize which may discourage some people. After two days, I am comfortable with it."}

The features on this device work flawlessly. The multiscreen is great, fast and really handy for some tasks. The photoshop touch app works great and even if you don't consider yourself an artist, you will feel like one. The pen is just amazing, really responsive and is awesome for note taking.\nThe specs are not the best, but I owned an infinity and returned right away i noticed some issues. These consisted of tne following:\n  -Continuous force closing\n  -Short battery life\n  -Light bleeding in various screen areas\n  -Felt uncomfortable in hands\n\n  What filled the cup was that in the lower right part on the screen, i was able to feel and hear a \"click\"  sound when pressing on it. I have read various reviews stating the same issue. And that it is due to bad glueing in the screen. The infinity has the best specs( quad core 1.7 ghz, gorilla glass 2, 1920 x 1200 screen resolution, keyboard dock, etc.), but all that only looks great in a spec sheet. While using the tablet, you are able to notice all those issues and will definetly return it. But let stop talking about the infinity and let's talk about what you want.\n\n  The note 10.1 is blazing fast thanks to its quad core 1.4 ghz exynos processor and its 2gb of ram, lag free and full of features. The 2 gigs of ram are great because the upcoming generation of tablet apps are really heavy and take some space while running. The screen looks decent enough, even though the ipad's is way better, this screen is fine and looks great. You cqn only notice the pixels if you stick your nose into the screen. The two speaker sound veery loud and the best i've heard in a tablet. The s note app works great with the stylus as well as polaris office. Samsung has done a great job with the user interface,  touchwiz is just great on this device. The only thing it has to envy is the ipad's screen resolution, but in every other aspect it is envied.\n\n  If you are between the jnfinity and this beast, you should go with this one. But if you are considering the ipad, that will be an OS decision. Comparing it to my brothers ipad, this beast is way better. It can do everything the ipad can plus much more."}

I have used Tablet PC's since 2003 and have been searching for an affordable slate that works well for note taking (I am a lawyer), email and general web use.  I do not care about multimedia as I use it for work.  I also have a Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet 16b wifi version and three Fujitsu Tablet PC's (T4215, T4020 and T5032). I also had the Fujitsu Q550 but sold it.  My wife has an Ipad and I also have a Nexus 7.\n\nThe Wacom  stylus makes a huge difference compared to the N-trig on the Lenovo.  Speed, accuracy and feel are much better with the Wacom.  The ease of writing is on par with the Fuji's which are the gold standard in my opinion.  Battery life is very good, it is easily an all day device with wifi on and high brightness while taking notes.  If you invoke the power saving mode the usage is even longer.\n\nThe software is pretty much standard Samsung fare but the S-Note is a nice program but rather simplistic.  If you buy this you should immediately go the Play Market and buy Lecture Notes, Lecture Notes Recorder and install the pdf plugin.  You can sync audio and written notes and replicate about 50% of the functionality of OneNote.  No other program comes close to offering the features of OneNote except Lecture Notes.  As an example, yesterday I took 5 hours of notes with audio and never had a problem.  I reviewed the synced audio and it is useful (you really need an external microphone but it is usable).\n\nAll in all, it is a great tablet at a reasonable price for business use with handwriting.

The update was pulled, so hopefully no one else will experience this from now on.\n\n-------------------------\noriginal review below\n-------------------------\nI received my Galaxy Note 10.1 last week, and have been playing with it without issue every day since.  This has been a five-star product until...\n\nToday, I just tried pulling out the pen and the touch panel seemed to go dead.  Everything on screen is still visible, just no touch function at all with either finger or pen.  Re-inserting the pen re-enables the finger touch functionality.\n\nShutting down the tablet and leaving the pen out, then re-testing pen function after turning it on still has no pen function.\n\nGreat, THE PEN IS NOW USELESS.\n\nI know my way around the Android OS having used my Samsung Vibrant(rooted to ICS) phone for the past two years, and also have used an Archos and an Acer Honeycomb tablet both upgraded to ICS.  With that said, none of the settings in the options are able to bring the pen functionality back.\n\nI'm now wondering if it's a magnet issue within the pen.  But I'll need to decide if I want to return this thing for a replacement or deal with Samsung Customer Service which I know will not be fun.\n\n*EDIT 8/29/12:  Just adding more after a little more testing.\n\nI turned on the tablet today, to try again to see if it would resolve itself.  Same problem still.  But now, I notice that after the tablet enters sleep and waking it up with the power button, the touch panel is dead without even pulling the pen out to cause the dilemma.\n\nSo I force restart now, and go into options to do a factory reset.  For those that don't know what this does, is that it'll reset the tablet to the condition as if it were coming out new in the box.  I just wanted to try this as a last ditch effort, but still dead touch panel problems.\n\nI'm convinced to send it back to Amazon now.  I'm fairly disappointed, because for the past week, I was quite happy with it.  I've also ordered a few accessories from here on Amazon which haven't even arrived yet."}

It is very responsive and accurate. And it's really fun as well! When I am bored, I just take the Note and write random things. Somebody below complained about the auto handwriting conversion to text. But I think it is almost impossible to convert the handwriting to text in a blink although I think it's still fast enough. And I could figure out the most of the problems that he had..\nAnd because I'm studying in engineering, I need to draw a lot of graphs , shapes, and formulas. And the auto shape match feature is the best part. I can draw anything very fast and it just makes them in the exact way that i want.\nUnfortunately, S-note is not pdf file friendly. Even though you can import pdf files into S-note, there are not many useful feataures for S-note. But of course you can download any pdf annotation app from the market. I found this app, EZpdf, and they optimized the app for galaxy note so that when the stylus pen is near the screen, your palm is not recognized like S-note so the annotation is perfect. Also, you can organize your files and you can search the meaning of words that you select in either dictionary or wikipedia right away.\n\nSo trust me. If you are a student, I don't think there is any other tablet that can satisfy you than this one. I know that ipad has many good note apps but what is the point of using them if there is no palm rejection feature?\n\nOther than taking notes, the performance is also blazing fast. I always complained that even screen scrolling is not smooth for androids compared to ipad but I think Samsung optimized this tablet very well. Even when you are doing the multiscreen, there is no lag at all (except that it takes 0.5 seconds to move to another screen). With the 2gb rams, you can open unlimited number of tabs in your web browser.\n\nAbout the resolution.. If you are not going to read the Bible which is full of very tiny letters, i don't think you will have any problem to read articles or papers. And this resolution doesn't make any difference for vidoes since 1080x720 is a standard resolution for tablet. Correct me if i'm wrong.\n\nFor watching videos or netflix, I really like that they put a dual speakers in front of the screen. It's very loud and clear. In my opinion, it's a huge difference from other tablets in terms of watching movies or listening to musics.\n\nI am not an art person but I take pictures a lot. And the phothoshop touch that comes with this is amazing. There are a lot of tutorials inside and it's easy to learn. With the s-pen, it is very fun to edit pictures. It is another thing that I like the most.\n\nThe only downside is that you need enough time to get used to the software. Since there are a lot of features, you have to play around with it for a while. For me, it took about 2 hours to be friendly with the interface. But it's like when you are new to android and have to spend some times to get used to the interface.\n\nSummary. If you are a student who needs to take notes and annotate pdf or slides, you SHOULD get the Note 10.1. With this, I am not going to bring any backpack and notes. I am reallllly happy with my new tablet!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "I liked the device in general as a tablet, it does a lot of things well. Quite smooth processing, GPS is very nice. Multitasking is well-thought. But I don't think that the NOTE app that comes with the tablet is useful for people basically looking for advanced note taking features. My main dislike of its note-taking features is caused by the handwriting to text conversion (dis)abilities of the NOTE app.\n\nI am a PhD student in History and I take written notes from my readings and archival documents. So I was for a long time looking for a good device that can properly convert what is written into digital text in an organized manner. I watched various videos of Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet in use and it didn't seem bad to me in general. Yet I had some reservations with the general performance of the device so I waited with the hope that stylus technologies and software will improve and a better device will come out soon. When I first heard about Samsung Note 10.1 thought that this would be the one and got excited though it is more expensive than Lenovo. And purchased it immediately. But I am really disappointed with its note-taking capabilities (My wife disliked it more than I did). I am not a well versed person in technical issues and I don't have much information about tablets and note taking technology but I think I know what will be a satisfying device for my needs and for people who are looking for a convenient and user friendly note-taking tablet.\nSo I think the software on Samsung Note 10.1 is really poor except for everyday simple note-taking tasks like preparing to-do lists or taking very quick, casual notes. It even makes your casual notes more casual when it converts them to digital text. Very annoying.\nI think that Lenovo does a better job in note-taking -especially in converting the handwriting to text- as far as I understand from the videos I watched about Lenovo and from my experience with Samsung Note 10.1.\n\nSamsung Note 10.1 recognizes your handwriting well and converts it to text rightly most of the times. (Indeed my wife also complained about the errors in conversion; my handwriting is better, so it performs enough overall with my handwriting). I don't find writing very uncomfortable but not very enjoyable too. You cannot get the feeling of writing on a paper and do get a sense of plasticity. This might be a common situation with note taking on tablets though.\nIt is also a little bit sloppy in displaying what you write. There is sometimes a slight lag in instantly showing what you write. It occasionally cannot respond well to your writing and misses some parts of what you scribe, especially if it is small in size.\nI mostly get pleasure from writing with a pen on paper. I understand the limits of writing on a tablet and don't set my standards so high and don't expect a similar performance from writing on a tablet with writing on a paper. But I don't feel that writing takes place with ease on this tablet. My handwriting looks worse than it actually is and I cannot write smoothly and small enough. Writing small is important with this device because the converted text ends where your handwriting ends, so I was trying to write smaller to put as much words as possible in one line to get more organized final text. Though I didn't had the best experience when writing, I could bear it if the software had performed satisfactorily.\n\nBut I think the main problem starts when the NOTE application converts what is written. It is not very easy to correct or delete what is written. First of all, the wait time before conversion when you ceased writing is not long enough - at least for me (I don't know if there is a setting to lag this time). So it gives you little thinking time while writing and puts you into discomfort since you cannot write when it is converting. Sometimes you try to continue writing after a short break for thinking and what you write cannot be displayed. This can be a problem if you are writing fast without looking at the screen; for example in the classroom.\nThe worse thing is when NOTE app converts a second group of words after pausing writing, the first word of what you write anew joins \"without any space\" the last word of what is written before. You have to push the space button first on the top menu before you continue to write. This surely disrupts a continuous writing experience, especially considering its short waiting time before conversion. You cannot immediately start writing where you left as in natural writing.\nAnd you have to press \"enter\" to go to the next line when you go on to write after pausing, which nonetheless makes sense.\nBut my main frustration is with its inadequacy of aligning the converted text. It actually creates a box of text when you start writing. If you want to write to somewhere else you have to create another box (paragraph) by pushing a specific button on the top menu. And I didn't like the way these boxes work. Managing them is quite cumbersome.\nWhen you are writing in a box, if you start writing in the next line it will convert your writings to the next line. This is good but the biggest issue here is when you arrive at the end of the line with your handwriting and go on to write without pause in the next line, the text will start in the next line although it has a lot of space till the end in digital format. So you won't get formated lines but irregularly short and long lines. It looks like what sometimes happens when you convert a PDF document to Word. And when you stop writing in the selected box the size of the box is determined by the size of the longest line, which means if you write a long set of text your box will extend as a long vertical box. It looks weird and irregular with other boxes with different width. I tried to write smaller so that the box would be wider but my handwriting wasn't small enough to put more words than the preset font of the digital text. And I couldn't find a way to set the font size (maybe there is, I am open to suggestions). I think Lenovo Thinkpad, actually MyScript Notes Mobile app, makes a better job in this respect, because it continues to add words to the digital text until the digital text arrives at the end of the line.\n\nSo It is a pain to manage converted text in this tables. You have to go to the specific box you want to edit and have to arrange the lines by the left, right, enter, space or back space buttons. You cannot select a word or add one in between two words -which generally happens in the natural flow of writing- by pointing out the location with the pen but you have to scroll to that specific location by using the right and left buttons on the top. You cannot delete a word by selecting it either -or by crossing it out as in Lenovo thinkpad. These are some of the quite inconvenient and clumsy features of the software. There are a lot like these. In sum, you cannot correct mistakes occurred during writing or during conversion to text when you are taking fast notes, for example whilst listening to someone. You cannot immediately interfere in a previously written section of the text. It will also take a lot of time to adjust the lines if you want to do so after you finish writing. So it is weird that it is a lot faster to type with your keyboard on your computer than writing with your hand on this device.\nGood thing is if you pause and continue writing, you can write anywhere and it will convert the text where you left but you have to put a space before you start as I said.\n\nIf you want to write to somewhere else you have to open a new box from the top menu. You can change the size of the boxes but the text does not adjust to the new size, so you cannot widen the text as you wish. You have to go to the beginning of each line and press back space button on the top to adjust lines.\n\nWhat is also ridiculous about Note app is that you cannot go back and convert a selected section of handwritten -unconverted- text you wrote on Notes. Adding such an option could save some time and partially compensate for mentioned shortcomings of the Notes app because writing on handwriting mode without instant conversion is more comfortable. This shortcoming finally made me realize that this thing is not intended for well-organized, professional note-taking purposes.\n\nIn sum, formatting and editing are really bad in this application. It even looks amateurish. I don't know if this device brings a good standard for the current tablets and note-taking software  technology so far but I don't think that the software for note-taking and especially for text conversion in this device will satisfy a common group of users who have expectations other than simple entertainment and very simplistic note-taking tasks.\n\nTo say the least, this device is far from being user friendly, functional and effective, considering that you spend a lot of time to put it into work and cannot get half the results you get from writing on a paper or even from typing. It doesn't seem that mentioned shortcomings are irremediable. The main issue that annoys me is that it looks like they didn't give much thought to improve program's functionality. The device does give you a clumsy and sketchy feel of use with note taking. With this device you cannot even get close to the ease of taking notes on a paper. I even doubted my ability to use the device after seeing many complimentary reviews which also caused me to purchase it in the first place. But if my experience with this device is correct, it is extremely ironic to name a device Samsung \"NOTE\" although one of the worst things it can do is providing a comfortable and effective note taking experience.\n\nMaybe I am expecting too much from this tablet with current technology. And maybe I could not make myself cognizant enough of its features. So I am open to any suggestions about using Note app more efficiently. Or I'd love to learn if the Note app is open to improvement in the short run or if there are other apps that can make better use of the potential of the tablet.\nI looked for other android applications for note taking and text conversion to give a last chance to this device but couldn't find a better one than MyScript Notes Mobile which I wasn't able download and install on this one.\nI am very disappointed with the incompetence of the software on this device for converting handwriting to text. I am still wondering if I missed a mark. I would give 2 stars if I only took the note-taking features of the device into consideration.\nSo I will return it unless it surprises me soon for good.\nNevertheless this tablet still might be a good choice for the ones who want to take note only in handwriting -without conversion- and the ones who looks mainly for drawing and photoshop features.\nI think it will be wise to wait for Microsoft Surface Pro, Lenovo Thinkpad 2 and especially for Ipad 4. There are news that Apple applied last year to take patent for a note-taking technology it developed. I am especially hopeful of coming iPad's competency of note-taking if it comes with it considering its retina display and its success in creating user-friendly and convenient apps. From the rumors I understand that they are trying to create a writing experience similar to one in note taking on paper. I am sure that all three will do a better job in this respect than Samsung Note 10.1."}

I'd rather have the dual-core processor crunching my input, than being eaten up just to make the screen resolution \"better\". Unless you hold it an inch from your face (and why would you do that?!), it looks amazing.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "This is my first review EVER on Amazon...\nI'm a simple person that appreciates quality over quantity... so, with that being said, if you're looking for a solid built tank... this isn't for you, BUT if you're looking for EVERYTHING that the iPad can't do, then this is your tablet of choice.  So, my point is - this device changes/overrides my quality over quantity rule.  I'm not saying that it is cheaply built, I'm just saying that it is not a heavy \"clunker\", like the Asus Infinity or pretty and delicately crafted iPad...  I've owned and use them both...  But, this is my primary \"go to\" tablet now...btw, where is my iPad????\n\nNow, why is white better?  I prefer anything that doesn't look like the iPad, but I must say that the white version (which looks very similar to the iPad) shows absolutely NO pesky fingerprints on the front border or the entire back casing... when the screen is turned off, of course you'll see the normal fingerprints on the screen itself.\n\nWhy didn't they tell me about the screen adjustments in the video tutorials????  I'm not talking about the BASIC brightness controls (which this blows the Galaxy S3 dim screen away (which I returned due to the dull display) - I realize it's a cell phone, but I'm just saying SAMSUNG VS. SAMSUNG)... Now, I'm talking about the amazing adjustments that makes the screen go from the factory stock blah to BAMMMM!!!!  Just go to SETTINGS then DISPLAY then SCREEN MODE... and change/adjust it to whatever setting you'd prefer... I actually prefer the MOVIE setting...  It makes the text and images sharper, to me for some reason...  of course there is a DYNAMIC setting which makes everything look like it says,\"DYNAMIC\"!!!  again, it's up to personal preference.\n\nLast, but not least, using the S Pen is crucial for my line of work - MUSICIAN (writing music/notation)...\nWhen I first used the S Note app... I was a little let down... THEN, I stumbled across the little black/blue pen icon in the top right corner... This allows you to COMPLETELY disable all accidental hand and finger triggers on the screen... THAT'S RIGHT...  100% pen ONLY writing/recognition...  TAKE THAT APPLE AND ASUS INFINITY!!!\nOf course, if you'd like to enable both S Pen and finger/hand recognition you can deactivate the pen tool... This can also be managed in the settings option within the S Note application...\n\nOKAY, THIS IS NOT AN IPAD KILLER!!!  YOU CAN'T COMPARE APPLES TO ORANGES...no pun intended...lol :) I have the iPad 2 and this screen is a tad better... but doesn't compete with the retina display of the NEW iPad 3... If it did, the battery life on the Note 10.1 would SUCK, as the processor would drain the battery quickly using S PEN Wacom technology along with retina display at the same time...  It'll be a couple of years before they can produce retina display alongside Wacom Technology with a solid long lasting battery... So, people PLEASE stop complaining about the 1280 X 720 screen resolution; when just a year ago, then iPad 2 looked just fine for all of us!!!  I'm not discounting the beautiful display of the NEW iPad 3, but have you tried using a stylus to do very fine detailed writing/notation... OK, you get my point...\n\nAND FOR G@D SAKE, WILL PEOPLE STOP CALLING THE S PEN A STYLUS??? I realize it's like a stylus and can perform BASIC functions of a stylus... BUT, IT IS WAAAAAY MORE THAN A STYLUS!!!  Be sure to hold the S Pen with the button facing up, as it can be frustrating trying to write and the Galaxy thinks you're trying to activate a \"special\" feature, when in actuality you're just pressing the button by accident...\n\nOK...

I actually found out that it will not only run split screens plus 5 apps like I mentioned but up to 11.\nThe screen resolution is NOT an issue at all. Only with the poorest of feeds will the display show up as fuzzy. The speaker stereo separation is fantastic. I didn't really notice until I played an audio book and heard how noticeable the separation actually was. I added while docked, each of my 5 different portable speakers to the back of the dock and the tablet speakers sounded better.\nCons: I noticed that when using the Chrome browser, that with too many tabs open, like over 12, the cut and paste quite working and the browser froze. This forced a total reset. I finally exchanged the tablet. Same problem again. So I gave up using the Chrome browser, and not a problem one since then. So not the tablet per say, but it and chrome just don't play nice when used so heavily. With the included tablet browser, after too many open tabs, a warning notice comes up and instructs to close a tab before opening another. That's it. Love Love Love this tablet, a lot to learn but worth the price of admission imho.\n\nI have been addicted to tablets for a couple of years now. I have stayed away from Apple products for personal reasons. So Android at this time is the best bet for me. I tried a Windows tablet last year and they were not ready for my needs at that time. The ones that might, cost over $1200 or more. I spend at least 6 hours a day on a tablet. I have owned 8 Android Tablets and one Windows tablet. I still have 4 Androids.\nI started with a $149 K-Mart tablet and went all the way to the $600 Asus Infinity TF700T.\nAsus TF700T, I know the Asus TF700 is a great tablet. I bought the only one on Amazon that was defective. No choice but to return. I just have bad luck sometimes. But it turned out OK in the end. I was able to wait for this one.\nI have a Galaxy Note i717 5.3\" cell phone and I love it, they call it the \"phablet \"but really it is too small for a tablet and more a supersized phone. But I love the display and the S Pen. So after watching MobileTechReviews, You Tube, of Lisa showing all the features of this tablet and her doing a smack down, with this tablet and the Asus TF700 Infinity, I made the decision to buy this one.\nI am very happy I did.***Full Samsung video review, live links are not permitted in reviews. So to see them, click on add comments below. The first one shows the videos.\n\nPros: 1) It shares speed honors for all Android tablet with the Asus TF700 they are too close to call. Each winning battles back and forth for sheer power and speed.\n2)It has split screen functions, meaning you can do two things side my side at the same time. Like read your email and do a web search on two separate screens yet on the same display screen. No other tablet can do that.\n3)It has a very strong WiFi modem, it pulls in signal my other tablets don't. Nice Nice Nice.\n4)It is one of the few tablets that pulls Wifi from both the 2.4 and the 5 bands. Exceptional.\n5) The touch screen is extremely sensitive and it takes only the slightest of touch to registeryour input. I think because of the S Pen's needs for sensitive touch of over 1,000 ranges. I mean this touchscreen is the best I have ever used or touched. It tracks you finger movement extremely tightly. No noticeably lag, it is like the item you are moving is stuck to your finger. Most if not all Android tablets have some lag. So good job Samsung on that.\n6) It has picture in picture video. You can run a movie on any screen and your can move the movie box around any where on your display surface. You can re-size it if it gets in the way. The display has settings like a TV or monitor, you adjust the color and tone.\n7) It has a feature called Smart Stay, which is basicly a little eye that watches your eye. If you fall asleep watching a video, it shuts off. In the morning it has your place saved in the video where it shut off at. Nice feature for me.\n8) It will handle up to a Micro 64GB SDXC storage card which writes up to 30mbps, really adding lots of extra storage since most tablets only support 32GB. Ipad and Nexus 7 don't support any on board.\n9) It has a decent front camera for video chat, and the a decent rear camera with a flash, tablets are not cameras but this one is above average.\n10) It has the S Pen, meaning your can write, draw and lots lots lots more.\n11) The software is unique to this tablet only, meaning you can do things on this tablet no other tablet can do. There are some others, older, that have some features similar but not close to this guy.\n12) It will convert your printing or hand writing into text. It plots and solves equations.\n13) It will convert your hand drawn circles and squares to proper ones, making your look good. It just has too many features to list with the S Pen.\n14) It comes with PhotoShop software and the only limit is your imagination.\n15) It has front facing speakers like all tablets should have.\n16) It comes in White and it is lite and attractive and with 2GBs of Ram and a 1.4 Samsung Quad Core, it is one of the fastest tablets on the market and only $499..Compare to the Excite 7.7 and it is easy to see the value.\n17) It will handle HDMI to a big screen and USB keyboards, mice, game controllers, external hard drives, I have have tried a 500GB external hard drive, and it should do even larger, just pickup the adapters. Not expensive at all.\n18) It has a real GPS. Works without WiFi. Blue Tooth and so much more...\n19) It has too many Pros to list, really, I only scratched the surface. Oh, it is also an IR remote control for you home TV system, even controls cable or Direct TV, it learns your favorite shows and suggests them to you. Too much, for sure...love it...Oh, and if you have other Samsung products, like a Galaxy S 3, it talks to them as well with All Share...neat...it also has a very deluxe battery monitor system that has 4 sections with lots of graphs and setting and over heat warnings to get extra months of battery life. I later watched a Samsung 10 minute and he showed multi-tasking up to 5 functions at once. Email and Polaris on the 2 split screens,then adding picture in picture video on top of those two adding the calculator and another pop up screen, over the 4 programs already opens. 5 open screens at once on and Android SupervTablet.\nVersus\nCons: 1) It gets a knock for only having a 1280x800 resolution display screen, but, really it has adjustments like a TV has and your can set picture settings. So no, it doesn't have Retina, but it does just fine without it. Since not many apps support those hi resolution displays anyway. It could not be priced at $499 if it had all it has, plus the over the top display. This one is just fine, and I am fussy. Speaking of fussy, since I do go back and forth with multiple tablets, the two things that keep this tablet from being 100% perfect for me are simple. The blacks are fine but could be deeper. The whites are fine but could be whiter. While using this tablet I don't notice this. When I switch back to another of my tablets, I am reminded of this fact. However,once I pick up this tablet, I forget all about it and just enjoy it for all it's features.\n2) This is not an iPad, so it takes some effort to get the most out of it, so expect a learning curve for the S Pen, but it can be used as a basic Android tablet if you want to GROW into it. If you are a person with no computer skills, it may be a bit much for you. Then again, you can just use what you understand. Emails, videos, Facebook, Web Browsing, and you can have a lot of fun playing with the pen\n3) Double edge sword, the good it will fully charge on a 5v source like a USB port or 5v power block, the bad is it takes up to 5 hours to charge. So best to charge at night. In contrast my Asus charges in 2 hour 15 minutes but on 5v and turned off, it will only charge 50% all night because it's wall charger is 12-15v.\n4) The biggest CON is it took so long to get here.....\nSigned Happy New Owner...Cheers"}

So a real PEN matters to me and Ipad lacks this ability.\n\nNote taking: The hardware is great and pen is accurate enough but the S NOTE app in not as easy to use as it should be. But it is good overall.\n\nAnnotating PDF:  Here is the first problem,  S NOTE does not allow to opn PDF s and edit them. Therefore you need some other app, the best I found is ezPDF which is still not perfect, for example it does not have eraser.  The NOTABILITY app on Ipad is much better than that.\n\nSurfing Web: I often listen to embedded audios and talks in websites and meanwhile I want to do other things on my laptop\\tablet (This is called multitasking). This works on Ipad, but it does not work on Android !! A big disappointment.\n\nReading PDFs: Resolution and pdf reading experience is not even comparable with Ipad. There is an annoying back light which does not let you raed Pdfs easily. You can see the Pixels and thats not good. After returning the device, I checked (the new) Ipad again,  readying PDF on that was really nice.\n\nBeside all these there some more (important) things you may want to know:\n\n-- Although processor is powerful but I don't feel any difference even with ipad 2, I can even say that the Ipad is smoother. I should mention that I never do gaming so I don't know about the difference in that area.\n\n-- If you occasionally visit websites in other languages (than English), for example Arabic, Farsi,... the fonts are horrible and You need another KeyBoard app to handle writing. Ipad does this job excellent.\n\nConclusion: Although I am not fan of any particular company, but if you don't need PEN then this device does not even come close to Ipad, so don't waste your Money. If you need a gaming device, I don't know. I most probably wait for Microsoft Surface Pro, which hopefully answer my needs."}

I called Verizon my wireless cellular provider. Spent an hour and a half with 3 different people trying to get the IMEI number so I could add this this my plan. This unit does NOT HAVE A SIM CARD !!! So it CANNOT be added to a service provider. Now I have to pack it back up, go to the post office to send it back, wait for my refund until I can go buy another one from a real store like Best Buy. This is total BS. Shame on Cellular Service for not putting that in the description."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Very good price and tablet considering the little Cosmetic damage but it works good so far and a case should take care of the little cosmetic issue. Only one little Scratch on screen( hard to see on camera) but hopefully its just a scratch. For the price im in love and especially knowing the price i paid for for a factory refurbished one 3 years ago. Hopefully it lasts a few years. Will definitely be getting another one for my daughter. Shipping was fast and very safe."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B008DWG5HE", "review": "Worked GREAT for the first four and a half years with no issues or complaints.  4.5 years in, the start up logo comes on screen and won't open any further.  Common occurrence with the model as there are several other claims of the same issue on online community boards.  Unfortunately, I've yet to see Samsung respond to or offer any kind of recall to cover the apparent wide-spread defect."}
