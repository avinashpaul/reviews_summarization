{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This is a great tablet. I love all the features. I do have a problem holding it without changing the page. There is a very small bevel on the sides. I guess you get more screen that way. The camera takes very grainy pictures no matter what mode you are in, also there is no flash. The audio is weak can barely hear it. Speaker is in the back. I like the SD slot which I promptly installed the 32 gb . It is a Wi fi only device. The router is upstairs and I still get signal in the backyard. The touch screen responds very well. The device is very light. I like the remote and TV Guide."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "Up front disclaimer: having owned many android, apple and windows devices (from all the big manufacturers), I am partial to none. I think they all have pros and cons.\n\nI was excited when I saw this tablet was coming out, with a quad core processor, a better display than its Tab 3 predecessor, and of course Android 4.4. It looked like a much better version of an affordable tablet.\n\nIt's ok. It's not bad, and I wouldn't rate it as such. But I did a physical comparison between it and the 2013 Nexus 7, which in my opinion is a valuable comparison since they are both on the same version of Android, and are both lower priced 7 inch tablets. The Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 doesn't even come close. This is for one big reason - lag. My guess is that this has everything to do with Samsung's custom Android skin, TouchWiz. There is noticeable lag when using the browser and other apps. There is noticeable lag when switching applications. Not all the time, but enough to make it a nuisance. This was not the case on the Nexus, which was snappy and smooth in all my use of it.\n\nOther points of comparison - the screen is not nearly as vivid on the Tab 4 as it is on the Nexus. The camera seemed slightly better on the Nexus, but really, it's a tablet... I'm not concerned with that so much. I do like the physical home button on the Galaxy but do not miss it having made the switch to the Nexus 7.\n\nAll in all, for the specs on the Galaxy Tab 4, it should really perform with no lag. It's disappointing to say the least. It is definitely not a \"bad\" tablet, and if you just want to spend 200 and no more, then you'll probably get the most out of it. But for not a lot more, you can get a much better experience in my humble opinion by getting the latest Nexus tab."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This Tab 4 WiFi tablet is just what I was searching for in the 7.0 model. I have used and tested thoroughly and found that it does have so many overall advantages. Now as a techie, I tested this tablet out to great lengths and below I will list what I have found to be the Pros and Cons of this amazing device.  (I purchased mine NEW, it was worth it new rather than Refurbished or Used, for the money, I believe worth the small amount extra).\nIf you are looking for: a lightweight tablet that is very easy to hold in one hand comfortably and you want a basic and easy to use tablet, then consider this tablet. While it does not have every bell and whistle installed on it, it is a good choice for: Checking emails, Getting Online, Looking at Pictures, Watching Home Movies. Here are the Pros and the Cons below:\n\nPROS:\n\n1- WiFi connects easily and the signal is good in most places I tested. And I received a STRONG WiFi signal on this device. In fact I have a very, very strong WiFi signal even in the back of my home (furthest from my router).\nHere is a tip: If you ever have trouble with your WiFi Router, unplug it for 2 minutes and then plug in again. In about 2 minutes, it will reset itself and should work wonderfully.\n\n2- The advantage of having a SD card slot that will hold up to 64GB.\n\n3- Small and lightweight. Comfortable to carry around and place in backpack or briefcase easily.\n\n4- Micro USB Port - This is common in most tablets these days, but the older Tab 2 line did not have micro port but the propriety wider port.\n\n5- Screen clarity  Excellent, the colors are bright and the text is very, very clear. For me, I found this screen easy to read eBooks on and view internet pages.\n\n6- I had a Tab 3 7.0 WiFi only and sold it to a friend, bought this one and find that it is a much better tablet.\n\n7- This tablet runs so so cool! In fact it runs much cooler than other tablets I have used! It runs from 70 degrees to 89 degrees basically which is great. Even when I am on data or WiFi and downloading apps etc, it just BRIEFLY goes up to about 99.5 or so degrees. Then it goes right back to about 88-89 degrees. This is a very safe range and is normal. What I was testing for is to discover if at any time this tablet ran over 106 degrees --- it did not. When a device gets too hot, it will turn off and re-boot and when this happens often, it will damage the device.\n**Having a low heat on this device is my favorite thing about this as I believe that this tablet will last a long time and not have to re-boot etc.\n\n8) Lightweight and small enough to read my Kindle books and eBooks with comfort! When I hold up this tablet to read a eBook, I can hold it comfortably for a long time.\n\n9) Fits so well in my purse or backpack, so easy to take places with me.\n**I use a Finitie Tab 4 7.0 Cover/stand (Slim style) that I bought here on Amazon for 13 dollars and it is wonderful to travel with.\n\nCONS (just one that I have found):\n- Low internal storage - this tablet comes with 8GB internal storage (advertised). Because the OS takes up room, apps etc, take up room, the tablet just has about 4.7GB in the internal storage. This is not good because when you install an app from the Playstore, it goes onto your internal storage not on the External SD card. (The external SD card is meant for personal files such as your music, photos, home movies, etc).\n\n**The GOOD NEWS IS: If you do not install a lot of huge games onto this tablet, you will probably do just fine with this storage.\n\nBottom line and Summary:\n\nWould I buy this tablet all over again? Yes in a heartbeat! If you are looking to buy a MINI TABLET, this is the one that I recommend to you as I love mine!\n\nSince I am a techie, you can ask me any questions in the comments under this review."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I'm coming off of an iPad 2 (march, 2011) and bought the Tab 4 7\" because my 2-year-old basically confiscated the iPad to play toddler games. I wanted something smaller that I could hold in one hand for reading, browsing, and a few games here and there.\n\nThe first impression of the design was that it was quite good for the price. It's light, it's slim and it's utilitarian. There's no aluminum uni-body construction here, just plastic and more plastic, but it certainty looks acceptable and I don't need to worry about scratching all that pretty brushed aluminum. What's the point if you're just going to slap a protective cover on it anyway?.\n\nOther impressions are that I like Android for it's openness compared to iOS. It may not look (by any means) as pretty, and it's certainly not consistently designed, but it works for what it was intended and I don't need Apple's \"approval\" to download an app that does something they don't agree with.\n\nI also like the ability to use cheap SD cards for storage (BIG plus here), whereas Apple locks up memory into a completely proprietary $100/GB scam. The stuff is on the market for $1/GB, and that's for the performance RAM. 'Nuf said about the fleecing Apple has been committing for YEARS when it comes to RAM prices.\n\nI'm not even going to complain about the paltry (these days) 1280x800 display. I don't need the extra resolution because my eye's aren't exactly what they used to be, nor do I want to pay for it. 1280x800 is acceptable, especially on a 7\" tablet, which makes for halfway decent density. I can't see the pixels even with glasses, so it's good enough. However If I were reviewing the 10.1, I'd be hammering it for pixel density.\n\nAll that being said, what I really do NOT like about the Tab 4 is that it's FREAKING SLOW. My (almost 4) year old iPad 2 blew this thing out of the water. I can only imagine that the 1.2Ghz processor Samsung is using is 3 years behind the times and/or there's not enough internal RAM (1.5GB). Somewhere along the way they decided to save $10 and gimp what would otherwise be a no-brainier choice. You can't even browse a simple page without lagging and shuddering. If I had to do anything quickly on this thing, I'd send it back immediately and get a Tab \"Pro\", which looks to be twice as fast at 2 times the cost.\n\nIn the end, and as long as you don't care/need anything even remotely resembling speed, this is a reasonable choice. To the reviewer that said \"Samsung has done it again!\", all I can say is, done what? Barely updated the under-powered Tab 3 with another under-powered Tab 4? Seriously how much does it cost a manufacturer to use a faster processor of their own design and production? $5, $10?  Some performance would have made this a 5-star tablet at this price point. As it stands, It's a ho-hum tablet at a ho-hum price."}

Then it started doing it at 60%, and now at 18 months, it will turn off within 5-10 min if it's not plugged into the charger.  As long as it's plugged in and I don't need to use sound, the device still works great.  But, the whole point of a tablet is mobility, so it's lost its core function.  I've tried to get it repaired, but it would be cheaper to replace with a new device.  I'm hesitant to purchase another Samsung tablet because all the other devices have reviews similar to mine.  I've tried using a Samsung phone and iPad combo, and it's too frustrating to remember which button does what on which device.  So, I'll stick with my non-mobile tablet for now until Samsung improves the longevity of their tablets."}

Over two years ago they released the 5.1 (Lollipop) update for the LTE version of the tablet. Us with the WIFI model are screwed. So basically if you ever want to update to newer Android firmware versions, DO NOT get this tablet, you will be left with KitKat for its life. This isn't to say KitKat is bad, but some apps require the newer versions and its sad that it was almost a waste as newer versions release and this becomes less and less supported."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "For the price, it's not a bad tablet. I do recommend Android devices, but although this is my second Samsung (previous model was a Tab 3), I've noticed several flaws with the brand.\n\nMemory: the onboard memory is very limited. Moving your media onto an external SD card, where possible, does help, but Samsung loads this thing down with so much bloatware that your performance will be limited. You can turn off some (not all) of these pre-installed applications, but without rooting the device you won't be able to remove them. Some user-installed applications can be moved to the SD card, which frees up some space, but this often brings other problems.\n\nGPS: The GPS on this device is, in a word, garbage. Even on a path with a clear view of the sky, a recent update of satellite constellations, and most active position poll turned on, accuracy is questionable at best. My pace data for a run under these circumstances constantly drops to 0 kph despite continuously moving. For run tracking or an that depends on the GPS like Zombies, Run! this is much less than ideal.\n\nPositives: it's fairly cheap. The screen quality is great and the unit is light weight. Battery life is decent. There are lots of apps available that do a much better job than the pre-installed ones."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I am a big fan of the 7\" size for tablets. They are large enough for comfortable reading and viewing, yet small and light enough to hold in one hand. I don't like carrying a large phone so I use a small phone for communicating and a 7\" tablet for content viewing. After my Nexus 7 became to slow and laggy I began looking for a replacement. There are a few manufacturers still selling them but on the whole they are in the \"low end\" category with minimal specs and memory. There are both good and bad aspects to this. On the good side it means that they are cheap, fast enough for regular use and long lasting as batteries are not taxed. On the down side though, they have minimal storage and are underpowered for games or other high voltage activities.\nIn my case I'm not a gamer so the only downside is low storage. 8GB is pitiful in this day and age and even if micro SD is available in many cases apps only work in device memory. Fortunately in my case I don't use a lot of apps so can live with the 8GB's.\nScreen resolution is always minimal in these low end models but I have found that 1200 x 800 is more than adequate for a 7\" tablet and needs less power than higher res options. Some tablets come with 1024x600, which lessens the cost but is noticeably more pixelated, so best to stay with the former.\nIt finally came down to a choice between The older Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 or the newer Galaxy tab A. What I noticed is that the older Tab 4 is still selling very well and is becoming more expensive! Both have very good reviews so wondered why the older model is still so coveted despite it being stuck in Android KitKat.\nThe reason I finally chose the older model is because after reading many reviews for both I read enough commenting that the older model was better in some vital regards for my use (for example some people said that the older tablet had noticeably better bluetooth reception, a key item for me).\n\nAfter a few weeks of use here is my report:\n- After loading all the apps that I use regularly I still have 2Gb remaining so am ok in that regard. Also installed an SD card for media consumption\n- I used developer mode to shut down animations and turned off Samsung Voice so there is absolutely no lag in performance\n- Bluetooth is FAST AND FLAWLESS\n-WIFI is VERY RESPONSIVE AND FAST. Websites load instantly and compared to other devices this one is as good or better than the other newer ones.\n-Screen is beautiful, photos show up crisp and colors are very accurate. I keep brightness at 25% for most indoor viewing to save battery so by the end of the day I still have plenty of juice.\n- Kitkat is just fine. As I only use the tablet for email, calendaring and basic media reading and viewing the older OS is more than suitable.\nSo in conclusion, the newer 7\" A is an excellent device and has all the newer bells and whistles. But did not want to risk some of the complaints that users of both units have mentioned so went for the older model. No regrets."}

You can hold \"Tons\" of movies on a micro SD cards..for the price this is great for trips. You do have to set the settings to do this..and if you do it wrong..it won't take long to fill your internal drive.  I find ipads are made better but both you put in a case..so does that make a differences. My only \"Beef\" with Galaxy is they don't upgrade. Or just upgrade once. .and I find the older the device gets it won't work as well online. were talking Years..but they are priced to replace like phones..Apple is a lot higher.and your subject to the memory your willing to pay for..The thumb memory apple has doesn't work that great..compared to the micro sd card. Apple screens a little better..the touch function are about the same..Music .Apple chip amps up music a little more.but the sound equalizer I would say it is better in the galaxy..It easier to have galaxy products to talk to each other on blue tooth..The cameras on both \"To me are both crappy\"..I find the phones camera on the galaxy is better, At the end of the day..it is what you use it for..You might get a better screen on a ipad..but you can't hold as much..unless you pay through the nose..both are good tablets..for different reason.."}

It's not a powerhouse machine. The processor is fast enough to browse the web and watch videos on YouTube without much lag. The display is bright but the colors aren't exactly vivd. However the resolution is good enough to meet or surpass satisfaction. It feels good in my hands and looks good too. The camera is not capable of taking stunning pictures. Most phones nowadays have better cameras that the Galaxy Tab 4. It's pretty much good for Web browsing, you tubing, and some small apps but nothing special. I bought this for my not-so tech savvy mom and she loves it. It far surpasses the crappie tablet that Verizon gave her for free. All in all, it's a decent little tablet for the price. I wish it were $50 cheaper like the HP Steam but hey, it's running Android and not windows so that's a plus."}

How they made a tablet without screen mirroring or the ability to use other USB drives by OTG seems to be intentional.  I couldn't figure out why I couldn't get my kids tablet to mirror the tv.  I thought it was me being stupid.  So I let them borrow my Note 8 in a silicone case, vs. the wonderful foam monstrosity this is in, so that they could mirror Cartoon Network.  They dropped it and shattered it to shards.  LOL.  So now, with this as the only working tablet in the house, I buckled down to figure out screen mirroring.  Guess what?  There is none. Samsung decided to intentionally handicap this tablet. You may be able to root it to bring back the functionality, but that's too much work for me.  I was giving it 3 stars.  Were it not handicapped, it'd be at least 4 stars. 7\" is a little small.  I don't understand how 1 inch makes such a difference, but that still wouldn't be a deal breaker the way the lack of mirroring is for us.  Hope this helps someone."}

The cases, the screen protectors, the memory cards, apps, whatever.

It's at min a quad-core (if memory serves), and even the texture on the back is smooth and fun. In a few years, when newer tablets come out for more money, this one is still going to be just as fast, as ones you could buy then. So it's a good one to buy for the price. Just consider if a 7\" is going to be big enough/worth it for the price. To save $50 - $100 to for a 7\" vs an 8\" was worth it to me. They do make a 10\" version too, but the price was nearly double at it's cheapest. So it's worth it to think about. 7\" is just fine for taking notes in my classes, finishing up and submitting the odd assignment, etc.\n\nThere is an annoying factor. Samsung split screen view is almost ALWAYS off because it don't work with any of the apps I ACTUALLY NEED IT TO! I can split between Chrome and Internet though. WOOPIE! It won't split between games and apps you need. Or my online school app and internet either. So...consider that."}

And the fact that apps need to be downloaded to the internal memory and not the extra SD card, it is absolutely useless. My kids have maybe a total of 8 games which two can never update cause there's not enough space. I mean come on, either make it so the SD card can be mainly used or don't gunk up the device with all that crap."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I am surprised to see this is still being sold. All the glowing reviews are from 2014, and at that time I would agree this was a very powerful and full-featured tablet for the price. This device's nomenclature is SM-T230. You won't be upgrading this tablet to any Android version higher than the 4.4 (the most current version is 7) that it comes with as Samsung does not actively develop for this tablet any longer. What makes matters even worse, is CyanogenMod has not spun up a version for this hardware and no one else has either. Apparently, the SM-T230 is built around the Marvell PXA1088 CPU, and the information developers would need to spin up a kernel running a more recent version of Android cannot be gotten because Marvell keeps it closed source.\n\nMy Galaxy Tab 4 never really worked right. It was extremely slow and unreliable. Using google maps for more than a minute or two would crash the device and reboot. I recently dumped the stock ROM in favor of a custom ROM by Team Acheron, and the device now works well. Performance is fine and the google maps crash hasn't happened since.\n\nIn addition, the stock ROM is full of google and samsung bloatware. This device has 8GB of storage and most of that is tied up with pre-installed stuff that you cannot remove. Installing an SD card doesn't help because the system won't allow you to move many apps to that storage. Installing the Acheron ROM solved that problem as well."}

Don't know why this seller's price is $50 higher a year later.\nPrice aside, I have had 4 of this model & have  loved them all. I am disabled & housebound. I read a LOT, so my tablets are in constant use. The only issues I have had are the charging port gets damaged easily. The metal blade inside bends, causing the plug to fit very loosely & not charge. The included  charging cables have very weak jackets which crack causing the wires inside to break which is another reason why they have charging issues. I think in my case, because I use my tablet almost constantly and while plugged in, charging I tend to be rough on them & that's how they get broken.\nThe internal memory is also misleading, it comes in 8GB & 16GB, a good deal of which is used up with the operating  system & preloaded apps. Many 8th the apps in the Google Play store are set up by the developers to automatically be stored in the internal RAM, which cannot be changed by the user, so the RAM gets used up really quickly, so an additional SD card is a must. They are expandable to 64GB, but I've found that 3GB  works fine for me, but I guess it would have to depend on the individual user.\nThose few issues & the price aside, this an awesome tablet, that's great for using as a simple eReader, yet powerful enough to run just about any gaming app out there. I love mine & would be lost without it."}

I'm talking 1 to 2 second latency, which is entirely unacceptable.\n\nFor comparison purposes, I own a 2.5-year-old Kindle Fire HDX.  Despite its age, the Kindle responds instantly to inputs from the screen, as any tablet should.  A brand-new tablet should not respond so slowly."}

I debated on getting an iPad instead since we (the parents) use them, but didn't want to spend that kind of money for a 6-year old's device.\nFor parents, it isn't that great.

I installed a 32GB memory chip and constantly have issues with the device correctly utilizing it.  Did a lot of research to solve some of the problems I was having and apparently this is a common issue with Android (unless you want to hack the device or download apps you have to pay for - no thanks).

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This device has the portability of a phone with a big screen and a high memory capacity.  I bought this galaxy so that I had something to distract me in waiting rooms and places with free wifi.  As much as I love my 10 inch 2-in-1, it's far too big and awkward to just whip out anywhere.  And my iphone is way too small with not nearly enough memory for much of anything beyond music and taking pictures.  This offers a comfortable middle ground.  I can watch downloaded movies, surf the internet without straining my eyes, and customize it to do everything else Android offers.  I'm a woman and it fits comfortably in one hand.\n\nSo why is it pointless?  Because it really isn't THAT much better or more useful than a modern day cellphone--something most people own and are quicker to reach for anyway.  It certainly doesn't have a lot of power but it does have a good battery life.  Still, my 2-in-1 at least runs windows and thus can do things this device can't.  And an apple product of the same size and function at the very least has a decent camera (something this does not).  After the newness wears off, I wouldn't be surprised if most buyers struggle to find a use for it.  Besides the rare occasion I'm somewhere out of the house long enough to sit through an entire movie, I sure am having a tough time justifying this purchase.\n\nThe system gets a little jittery and slow while updating itself and apps (which pretty much every time you turn it on) so wait for it to finish updating before doing anything to avoid this.  Otherwise, enjoy."}

Too bad that most of the apps she downloads and uses have to be on the internal storage.  Add to the fact that half of the internal storage is for the operating system and apps that can't be removed, which just adds more frustration to the experience, and making that 32 GB SD card completely useless.\n\nThis was the first time I bought a Samsung handheld device and it will likely be my last.

The MAJOR, HUGE problem that the tablet caused was that there was NO mention that syncing up my email with my laptop would completely eliminate ALL my emails and folders.  Every. Single. Email.  And according to my service provider, the emails are gone with no way to retrieve them.  Every single important email that I saved regarding my cancer treatment plan, my legal and Medicare info, my financial info.  It's all gone.  Thanks Samsung.  I know that I am hopelessly naive about using newer technology, but I would have expected some tiny mention of the fact that if you sync your emails, your system will switch your POP email to IMAP mail causing the loss of everything that's important.  As regards the rest of this review, I don't know.  I am so angry about the email fiasco, I put the stupid tablet down and have not touched it again."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I chose this mid sized Android tablet to serve as the screen to my drone controller. It first was the correct size to fit nicely in the bracket provided with the quadcopter kit. It also has sufficient processing speed, memory, screen resolution and brightness, and battery life to run the software, process telemetry, display the live video feed, plan autonomous missions, and most importantly- handle all of that without exception, and without running out of memory and thus freezing/locking up- which would leave me flying $3,000 worth of hardware blindly through the air. It also has a good gps chip, which is useful for any number of drone operations. Having said that, I think that mine is a fairly extreme application, and given the fact that this Tablet was so up to the task while being put through my outdoor torture tests, I have no reservations about recommending the Tab 4 to anyone. It will endear itself to novices, tweeting teens, app developers, and everyone in between."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!\nI purchased this item as a Christmas present for my daughter back in 2014. I was happy with the price since I didn't want to spend much on it in case it would end up broken. After owning it for almost 2 years, I can say this was the most disappointing purchase I have ever made. The tablet didn't get as much use as I thought because it would constantly need to be charged, something I thought was odd since Samsung products usually have great battery life compared to Apple. Then it stopped charging completely, and I tried many different options, and even contacted Samsung directly for help. They gave me a few options as to what I could do to get it to work. Finally nothing worked, so I contacted them again and since it was under warranty I was able to have it serviced at no cost. We received our serviced tablet in October 2015, and it only lasted till March 2016. I am currently having the exact same issues, the tablet won't charge. Again I contacted Samsung but unfortunately, the item is no longer under warranty. We would have to pay $65 + $9.99 (shipping) to have it serviced. I decided that I wouldn't spend the money on having it serviced because I don't think the problem will be solved and I would rather put the money into a new tablet. The tablet was purchased mainly for my daughter to be able to use her ABC Mouse account and use it for learning experience. She is 6 going on 7 so the wear and tear was minimal. We bought the protective case to avoid any issues, After all that, my daughter was barely able to use it and now it's just sitting on a shelf collecting dust, I wish I would have invested my money more wisely. I could understand if I purchased a $50-$70 tablet, but I went with a name brand that is known to avoid wasting money but that wasn't the case. I would suggest, definitely spending the money. My other daughter received an Apple Mini 2 for her birthday and that was a year ago and have had no issues with it at all."}

I have 2 others but my Samsung is the only one I use. I would suggest that if you take a lot of pictures, like I do, that you buy a micro SD card. Mine is a Samsung 32 gig. You can set it to be the default card, rather than the pictures  going to your tablet. I highly recommend this tablet. You won't be disappointed."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This is literally the WORST product I've EVER used. I will never ever buy Samsung/Android product ever again. I wanted to like this tablet so much. It's the perfect size and the screen and color aren't too bad either. But there's just too many negatives to it.\n\n1. It's unbearably slow. For a tablet that's just 2 years old, the performance on this thing lags behind even older tablets. Changing apps or switching screens requires a lot of patience.\n\n2. It freezes constantly. Any fast movement would often freeze the tablet, afterward it will crash and you would have to constantly reboot it again and again. My tablet got so bad that it's in a constant reboot, where it would freeze in the middle of a reboot and won't even boot up completely. This is insane. There's really no room for that type of bug.\n\n3. There's not enough memory. While it's great that there's an external memory slot, using the external memory uses extra memory from the tablet and slows it down even more. Quite counter productive.\n\n4. It can not handle multitasking as intended. Having 2 apps open at once while it updates some apps will sure to crash it. Seriously, why does that even happen??\n\n5. There's too many native apps that you can't delete. The tablet only comes with 8GB and almost half of it is already used up for whatever reason and you can't even clear up the memory."}

I own other Samsung products and I guess I based my purchase on brand loyalty. The specs seemed okay for the price so we bought a brand new version of the tablet. I unboxed it and everything looked fine. However, the device was very laggy. I would click a button and it would take at least 2-3 seconds to respond and load. When zooming out and in the device would jerk and lag. Also, the screen quality was horrible compared to my ipad mini 2 and a nexus 7 that I have owned. This shocked me. I had a kindle fire that was $49.99 which worked flawlessly out of the box. The tab 4 is three times the price and ran horribly on the first day. We have already sent it back. We will try again with a different brand."}

Edited: In fact, you won't even get 8GB, because 3.28GB of that is already being used to run the system. Add the Google related apps that are pre-installed and you really only have 3.5GB of device storage. I thought getting a 64GB microSD card would allow me to install more apps but when you move an app to the card, you're really only moving part of it (an average of 15% of the app size). Most of the app needs to stay installed on the device in order to run."}

Low quality and sometimes blurry.\n\nMy main complaint with the device is that it runs slowly. Many times the buttons on screen are slow to respond, sometimes unresponsive, and requires multiple button piushes. It still runs, but not at the speed I would like.\n\nGreat for reading text, OK for playing videos, not very good for games. My other gripe is battery life. It's not very good. I can watch Netflix for about three, maybe four hours at 40% screen brightness. It's ok, but not great.\n\nOverall it has it's flaws but for the price I think it's worth it."}

Lollipop is available and so is Marshmallow (you have to love Android's firmware names, seriously). After much research, Samsung is NOT upgrading the Tab 4, model SM-T230NU. Apparently it is focusing on 8.0 tablets and higher. Does that mean the tablet doesn't work? Of course not.

The OS itself takes up 4 gigs and there's just no room for more than a couple of games.  Definitely not worth the $150.  I figured some kids games wouldn't take up that much space, but there's room for nothing.  Don't waste your money.  Get at least an 16, preferably a 32 gig version.  Absurd that the OS takes up that much room.  I'd throw this thing at the wall at this point.  Super frustrating"}

The product is very good for every day around the home use.  The size and weight make it possible to hold and use with one hand if needed.  The screen is large enough for viewing medium sized videos or for internet browsing.  If you wanted to read non mobile websites, you will find yourself zooming in to read text.  App based sites or mobile friendly websites are preferred as the screen is only 7 inches. I find the tablet fills the gap between desktop or laptop devices and Cellphones."}

I AM IN NO WAY AFFILIATED WITH SAMSUNG OR LENOVO. .\n\nI bought this tablet primarily to deposit checks into my bank electronically. My bank requires an IOS or Android operating system, for Android, they require 2,3,2 or higher. (this tablet comes with Kit  Kat which is 4 point something but certainly adequate. So , I installed the app for my bank, and there was no \"Deposit Check\" option in the menu of options. .I called my bank They told me that if the camera SUCKS, and isn't adequate for photographing the check, it detects that inadequacy and doesn't give you that option. .Turns out you need a tablet with an AUTO FOCUS lens and not a FIXED focus lens to  deposit a check THIS tablet has a garbage FIXED focus lens and I can therefore not use it for what I intended to use it for. I like that you can upgrade storage via a mini SD card (up to 32 GB according to Samsung but others say you can go as high as 64) .So, the camera SUCKS, you CANNOT replace the battery. (I hate that Samsung and others have followed Apple ,the KING of planned obsolescence ,and won't let you change the battery. On other Samsung models, ,you can't change the battery OR  the SD card Same with Apple .So, I returned this piece of JUNK and now bought a Lenovo Yoga 2 (8 inch) for $159.99 directly from Lenovo. WOW what a difference. MUCH stronger processor, MORE RAM. More storage space that is up-gradable via an SD card LONG battery life (Battery is not replaceable however) but the Lenovo is better in every way AND it has an AUTO FOCUS LENS so I can now DEPOSIT MY CHECKS ELECTRONICALLY YAY! Trust me, skip this piece of junk, spend a little more and get the Lenovo Yoga 2 (8 inch). NICE 8 INCH DISPLAY as well.\nPS. .I also called Samsung BEFORE I made this purchase and they told me the camera was adequate for my depositing checks Their customer service sucks and they give out WRONG info ."}

To begin with, the Tab was sold by Amazon as no other company was listed. Though I absolutely love and trust  Amazon,  I should have seen the red flag--as compared to stores and service providers, the price was really low, therefore enticing. Just recently noticed that when unplugged, battery drains way too fast. I'm also lax and just got around to downloading important apps like virus protection and security. After download of Google security app, got pop-ups telling me there is a threat on device draining battery. Wasn't called a virus, called a threat. Virus scan said there were no threats on device so I'm between a rock and a hard place. Not sure what to do."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "10/18/16: I noticed the price is $175!!!  People, get the ASUS Zenpad S 8 for this price.  This tablet was as cheap as $99 at one point in time and averaged $129.  It is NOT worth $175 with the mediocre display (2K with Zenpad) and processor.  Wow Samsung you guys gone downhill!\n\nI'm going to sound like the odd sheep with so many 5-stars here but was quite disappointed with this tablet.  Amazon had this on sale for around $120 which I ended up price matching locally but for a newer tablet with a great screen resolution I thought I could have another cheap tablet and not worry if it breaks in the next couple years.\n\nFirst of all the device itself is solid.  Comparing with the Tab 3 the screen resolution is a night and day difference.  The battery life like as mentioned is great especially when it's just idling with the screen off it doesn't lose much charge which is very nice.  Being able to stick external micro SD card is nice as well.\n\nI would've honestly traded the Tab 3's screen resolution for a snappier screen.  In fact I tried this stock ROM and used deodexed ROM but could not get the screen to respond quickly.  Sometimes I have to hit the button few times before the tablet would recognize my finger.  It got annoying really fast.  Then the lag continued and would drop out of Wifi within a foot range (hotspot through my phone) or randomly stop communicating with the host.\n\nFor this price I would've just bought the Nexus 7 (2013) as much as they had BT issue.  It's so disappointing; I thought I would give Samsung a try again but this tablet is NOT worth $150.  The response & the lag was just terrible.  My LG G3 phone is way snappier and faster than this tablet."}

It charges from the wall in about 4 - 5 hours.  That seems slow since I have a fast charger for another device that works in less than an hour, but this tablet is not the latest model.\n\nOne con - for some reason, the sound keeps turning itself on no matter how many times I turn it off.  Also, it seems quite heavy, but that is to be expected for the decent battery life.\n\nOverall, I am quite happy with my purchase, and the price was right."}

This new tablet looks good, and I'm not having any issues with the WiFi connection or sound, but it's just unusably slow. I can't tell if every new screen I transition to is freezing up or if there's a problem with the touch buttons working right away when I migrate to a new screen, but I shouldn't have to (for example) tap an email 7 times for it to open. And that's 7 times with waiting a few seconds in between each try. Other reviewers here have mentioned this ridiculous slowness, so I don't think it's just this unit. I'll give it a few days and then may just return it --- unless I'm able to discover a setting change that rectifies this problem, this tablet is so slow as to be unusable for me."}

They aren't missing anything that the iPad would have given them. The Google Play store is just as good as the Apple store and it is very user friendly.

When they try to do puzzles the pieces don't move with their finger and when they do they jump from spot to spot.  It's a slow sluggish tablet.  Very disappointed!!  My S4 is better by far than this little tablet.  My old ipad2 works well with the app too.  I tried some suggestions from the web to speed it up but nothing is working."}

Excellent for Web browsing and e book reading.. Some occasional video binging and the ability to cast onto my smart tv is excellent for those longer more intense video binging sessions. I have to say tho the downsides are that its a little slow at multitasking and sometimes can't handle very well me updating apps and allowing me to browse at the same time.. Cameras are quite frankly terrible but I expected that and besides I never shoot anything on a tablet really..also certain apps don't allow me to use SD card as storage and the 8gb on board memory doesn't really leave much space to play with.. Otherwise excellent tablet, for the price I would definitely recommend it if you don't need it for anything labour intensive"}

Beautiful HD display. The sound isn't great but acceptable for my purposes. The only real complaint I have is the screen orientation doesn't respond well when switching from landscape back to portrait, sometimes it doesn't adjust until refreshed. Screen orientation is very sensitive when switching from portrait to landscape, too sensitive sometimes, then I can't get it to go back to portrait. The item was shipped in the retail box in a pasteboard Priority Mail envelope without any packing material. The envelope arrive with a hole in one corner and the retail packaging inside was crushed on one corner, but the unit did not sustain any damage. I recommend better packing for shipment.

I was very disappointed with this purchase and contemplated selling it since returning was not an option (live outside the USA). After deleting everything I felt I can do without it was still very short on internal memory and quite slow. I have rooted and installed custom ROMS on all my devices and proceeded to do that on the Tab 4. I am now very pleased with this device, was able to delete all the factory installed bloatware and the google apps I do not use. Plus it is noticeably faster now with this ROM. This is a superior device compared to my 2012 Nexus 7 making me more than satisfied with the purchase."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "GARBAGE.  I am truly impressed with how incredibly UNRESPONSIVE the screen is to tap inputs.  Oh my god.  You cannot realistically use this tablet at normal human operating speed.  You have to willfully slow down and focus on NAILING the mysteriously hidden sweet spot on every on-screen input button just to get this stupid TURTLE of a crap-gadget to respond to your finger input.  And when I say NAILING, I mean you have to hit it pretty hard, and most of the time, MULTIPLE TIMES to get an onscreen button to respond.  This is disgraceful and there is no excuse for a company as big as Samsung to put something out that is this embarrasingly low grade.\n\nI cannot believe that I paid $150 for this hunk of poorly made junk.  Also, it is not compatible with many of the most popular games on the android market, such as Clash of Clans.  Ever heard of it?  Yeah.  So you have to change your settings to allow downloads from unknown sources and install a Clashofclans.apk game app just to be able to play one of the most popular games of all time.  And once you go through this annoying process, then my friend:  YOU ARE IN FOR A TREAT! And by treat, I mean TORTURE.  Playing Clash has never been more PAINFUL and SLOW.  But be persistent, and eventually the screen will respond to your endless stream of tap attempts.\n\nBottom Line:  try another tablet.  Maybe a Nexus 7 or Kindle Fire HD?  For being at the top end price point for a 7\" tablet, this Samsung Tab4 is a bust."}

The construction seems solid with no loose buttons and the screen is relatively good.  I like the coating on the display glass as it made swiping easier.  I use this for several hours each day and it has essentially replaced my desktop for most consumption tasks.  Web browsing is decent and Youtube videos are smooth.  The brightness of the screen is still holding up well after so much usage when compared with some of my other devices.\n\nThere are some annoying aspects that pop up every so often.  The 8 GB of flash memory isn't enough for me and although I moved all the apps that I could move to the SD card, there is conflicting information on the amount of free space I have remaining.  For example, I would sometimes get an \"Insufficient space\" notification when trying to update apps but the Settings page reported that I have over 500 MBs free.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "For the money, and as shipped, this is an excellent value.  However, there is a hidden flaw.  One of the advantages of the Samsung tablets is the IR blaster, which will allow the device to be used as a remote control for TV, Audio Equipment, etc.  I purchased 4 of these devices to use in this capacity in my business.  With the release of Samsung's version of Android 5 (Lollipop), the IR blaster feature is completely disabled.  Applications, even those bundled with the device by Samsung, simply cannot find the IR blaster on the device.  Samsung completely refuses to even admit that the problem exists, giving me an endless runaround and turning a deaf ear.  I've had trouble tickets open on this for months with no response of any kind from Samsung.  The problem has been well known and documented since early 2015, yet Samsung won't even acknowledge it."}

I have not been so disappointed with an electronic before this. I e-mailed Ocean Reef electronics for advise on how to get it to come on and they just said too bad so sad, we only accept returns within 30 days, no advise offered on what I may be able to do to get the thing to charge and turn on. I had to replace this in January with an RCA Viking Pro after buying this Samsung for my sons b-day at the end of October. He went through most of December without one since we gave his cheapo one to a neighbor girl. I am overall very disappointed with this purchase. I would not recommend a Samsung tablet to anyone.

I think it is pretty obvious that they have no intention to do so, but they are not bothering to update their website.  If you purchase this tablet, you will quickly find yourself so far behind the current release that applications will not work correctly and you will not be able to advantage of the newer Android features.

I added Armorsuit Military shield screen protection and NEWSTYLE shockproof lightweight tablet protectors and they have been the most incredible thing for the kids. Because it's android I have Google play that matches my account and we have not had many limitiations.  They have primarily been using these for their preschool studies using ABC MOUSE, but they also use them for games and YouTube kids and Minecraft PE and art. They have been fuctioning well for 14 months of constant use and kids toughness. One even survived being washed under the running faucet! (The protective foam helped) These have been powerful enough and versatile enough to not give us any headaches, and many hours of peace, as well a solid educational and artistic start. These are awesome for travel too. They don't have removable batteries but they do have easily accessible SD card ports so you can load them up with kids favorites. Samsung has a native app called Kids Mode that is fun by itself and integrates cameras and media very well. It blocks certain apps it feels aren't for secure enough for children like regular youtube or purchasing apps, but thanks to youtube kids it's no longer a problem. We also have used Kids Place by Kiddoware as an app for the the kids tablets too. Also since these are Samsung tablets they are great for mom and dad to use when they aren't."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "Purchased this during the summer.  My previous tablet was a google Nexus 7 which I liked for almost two years. It didn't have an expansion slot and I never rand out of space. I loved this new tablet at first. The hardware is snappy and responsive. The screen is bright and good angle viewing. No issues with the hardware it's the best one yet.\nWhat breaks this tablet is the size of the main drive and the restriction of what apps you can store on which drive. You only have 8Gb of space most apps for some reason have to be on. You can not use your SD card so your drive fills up rather fast with data and apps. There doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason as to what apps will use what drives. It's quite arbitrary. Because of this the device is worthless unless you want to just store movies and TV shows on the SD card. The other issue that completely breaks this tablets usefulness is the restriction on OTC devices and usage of the USB port. This device will block any attempt to add USB storage. I've had 3 expencive 64Gb USB drives that work on older tablets but refuse to be recognized by this device. they have blocked this functionality entirely from what I can tell. No drivers work from any company. If you use this just for reading it's a very nice tablet at a good price and a good recommendation. If you are a stargazer and active person with varied interests this will have you frustrated and regretting the purchase very quickly. There are a few other smaller restrictions I've found that the Nexus doesn't have. Main being the Samsung skin on android is just that meant to restrict your ability to use this device the way you want or need too. And advertizing that you don't own this device that you paid for so you can't use it the way you need to. Only the way they want you too in their ecosystem. Then there is updates that never happen. Would I buy it again? No."}

I had a Kindle fire before this one. It worked for about 3 years then it just wouldn't turn on one day.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "If you're thinking this is the poor man's iPad Mini, you've got the wrong tablet. I own two iPad Mini 2's for home use. This one I keep in my work padfolio (hardly adds any bulk to the padfolio), and as my workplace has abundant WiFi, this is great to browse the web, check out social media, play a game or two, or check email, and they're awesome to pass the time in an airport, as the battery life is pretty good. The seven-inch model is very easy to hold in your hand for reading, and the screen resolution is very good as well. The single speaker at the rear of the tablet isn't the greatest, but you could throw on a set of Bluetooth headphones and be set. The front and rear cameras are basic, and there's no flash on the rear. This tablet is runs on Android KitKat, and probably could use the Lollipop upgrade, but if it's that important, you should probably buy either a different Android tablet, or the 4G-LTE version of this one that has a better chipset and has already received the upgrade to Lollipop. Apparently, Samsung has forgotten to throw out the upgrade for the WiFi version.\n\nFor the price, this little tablet is hard to beat, plus Samsung products are pretty solid. I'd much rather pay a little more for this over a non-name brand tablet, even though they're probably all made in the same Chinese factory. As long as you run this thing lean on apps and keep as much as possible on a MicroSD card, this is plenty fast for basic use."}

This thing is slower, less responsive, and has far less memory. I didn't think this would be a problem because there's a slot for a miniSD, but most native apps are installed to the internal memory, which is already taken up in large part by the OS, and cannot be transferred to the external. Fought with the device for three days to come up with a configuration that would allow me to have at least my most important apps, but the performance is so much worse than my old tablet (from 2013). I like the side menu for the multiple windows, but only some apps work with it and frankly I use it more as quick access to a few apps than try to split a 7\" screen."}

It's very hard to hear audio on it, especially if you are using apps like Periscope, Facebook Video chat etc. That's the only reason I give it four stars. The second issue is the volume and power button are too close together, and sometimes when I'm watching YouTube, I want to turn the volume up, and end up shutting the screen off. It's a little frustrating. All in all, it's a great device, just a giant version of the Galaxy S4/S5/S6 (I've owned them all.) So very user friendly.

It's slow, laggy and spits n spudders at the slightest of finger swipes. It's 2016, my 2007 iphone ran smoother than this crap. Simple web browsing is NOT smooth. Video playback is terrible (choppy). Games take forever to startup and run like do-do. This is my second android/samsung device and it's very disappointing. My friend that's in the know told me I needed to \"root\" it and remove the crap stock software that's slowing it down. So I did that, no change in performance. The person I got this for is constantly bringing back to me for various reasons (before and after rooting before you try to blame that). Either the sound wouldn't work or the wi-fi would keep disconnecting. Now the keyboard is freezing and keeps typing letters with accent marks above them. Imagine trying to type in a password when that going on... Also, the speaker is on the BACK??? WHY?! The people behind the tablet can hear it clear as day, the person using it, not at all. It almost requires headphones but if you disconnect/reconnect headphones too many times the sound quits working all together and requires a reboot to work again. Absolute crap. Can't believe I wasted money on this and now have to waste my time on it. Should have just done what EVERYBODY was saying and get an older ipad mini for $60 more. May still do that and use this as a doorstop/birdcage liner. Guess it's a good \"starter tablet\" for someone so they appreciate the actual tablet (apple) they get next. You get what you pay for.

We had purchased another tablet, going for something really cheap, but it couldn't deal with the demands of my children (which are occasionally watching youtube or playing minecraft and some other random game). The tablet freaked out and then stopped charging and after that failure we looked for a tablet that is not too big or heavy, needed the speed and the capability to increase the memory of the tablet as well and we saw this tablet. It had what we needed. It is pretty fast. It's easy to set up and use and it has a pretty decent battery life. We also got the Newstyle case for this tablet which really comes in handy for any child. Since we don't use it for much else besides watching some videos, and occasionally playing games on it, I can't comment on how well it works for email, or looking things up online, but it is fantastic for our needs."}

The major downfall of this device is the internal storage, as many on hear have mentioned.  8 GB of internal storage is ridiculously low when you consider the OS itself takes up over 3 GB.  With the device running on Android 4.4 KitKat, writing and moving apps to the micro SD is restricted, making the expandable micro SD slot useless.  The only way to work around not being able to write to the SD card is to root the device, therefore voiding the warranty.  Not happy.  Might return it and just upgrade to the Tab S2 or Ipad with more internal storage."}

Size of keypad is perfect for me, it demands using both hands, but it's very easy and convenient.  Photos are good, even tho there is no flash. I use it mostly for Internet browsing, shopping,  a little bit of business,  watching movies and playing games. Downloading and installing is pretty fast.

I found this to be a very helpful, light weight, tool in quickly searching and obtaining WI-Fi, composing logs, obtaining photographs and videos, and ease in downloading and sending materials.  Although, I still have not got use to the word processor and the word/spell correct mechanism, I prefer this unit to my other devices.\n\nDue to the fact our homes have WI-Fi it was the perfect gift for my wife who is challenged in computer skills.  Therefore, I purchased this unit again for her at 33% lower cost than what I paid 10 months earlier.  The only difference is her unit did not come with a sleeve case as mine.  I was very surprised how she managed the unit for in one week without my assistance she was e-mailing, watching Netflix and dictating with the unit.  Unbelievable adaptability for the novice!

So i went out and bought a large sd card for it. The problem there is you cannot download apps straight to your memory card. So if you want to use it as a internet browser, with facebook and twitter then this is your tablet. otherwise get a SD card and download one app at a time and move it to the memory card. Pray that the apps you download allow this. If you can afford it buy the larger better tablet."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I think these are great for kids. I bought 2 of them for mine and they absolutely love them.\n\nPros: Pretty cheap tablet. Runs ok most of the time .Very portable. Runs most games without any lag. External sd support so you can pop in a sd card to add music and movies to it. Battery life is great as well.\n\nCons : 8gb of memory ends up being like 4gb free for the user. Games are getting huge in size so my kids have to constantly uninstall stuff to make room for new stuff. Sometimes it'll lag but what can you expect from a $150 tablet. Screen isn't the best but again price.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend it if you're getting this for your kids or if you are a light user whos only going to be using it for simple stuff like web browsing and YouTube. If you're a power user I'd definitely recommend a spending the extra money on something a little more powerful and with more internal space. I have the Galaxy Tab S 10.5 and it is an amazing tablet."}

It did what a tablet does, mobile web browsing with the Google app store for other neat things to try out. I have had this for at least a year now. The performance of the device has severely degraded to what it was out of the box, which is to be expected in my opinion. For the price that was paid, I guess it was worth it. The performance compared to the Apple products that I am use to using cannot be measured. I still have a first generation iPad that is working/performing better than the Galaxy Tab.\n\nI do not tend to download many apps. I have only the out of the box apps plus less than five apps (games). Maybe a full format of the device would help, but I have done that already. Storage was not an issue because I had a 64GB memory card placed in this device. If there are some apps that could boost performance, I have not found any.\n\nOverall, its a nice device to have but I would honestly stick with Apple products that will last. Nothing wrong with the Galaxy Tab."}

This is a basic tablet for browsing, email, netflix, youtube, reddit etc. I use it at home instead of my note 4 because it feels great in the hand and has a larger screen. Samsung did a great job here because there is almost NO bloatware. Once you go into developer options and turn off animations, replace the launcher (I use Nova) and replace lock screen and wallpaper it becomes a great little workhorse. Battery life is great.  I gave it 4 stars because the only thing I would change is it needs a little better speaker but I use my old lg 750 bluetooth just for this tablet and that fixes that problem. This is no gaming tablet. I have the Nvidia Shield for that. I use this tablet a lot more than my expensive tablets because its light and feels good in the hand. I plan on staying with the tab line as long as Sammy doesn't screw it up and try to make it too fancy. I got a white on to match my Note 4 and I love them both."}

Although surprised, I was ok with this and Amazon never contacted me about this. So just know that this review applies to the 10.1\" version, although I think it would be the same for the 7\". I have been satisfied with this table, but have run into one major frustration over the last couple days. I wanted to find out how to connect the tablet to an HDTV (not a SMART TV) via HDMI cable. Sounds simple enough, right? Well, unfortunately it turns out that there is no satisfactory way to do this. The capability to connect to an HDTV via HDMI was inexplicably not built into this tablet, although both earlier and later Samsung Galaxy tablets have this capability. I spent a lot of time trying to find an adaptor that would work. I called Samsung, and they said they don't make an adapter for this tablet, and to go ask at Best Buy. At Best Buy, that's where I found out that the necessary functionality to connect to an HDTV via HDMI was not built into the Galaxy Tab 4s. He said the only solution is Google Chromecast, but this turns out to be unsatisfactory as well, since each app must choose to build in the capability to use Google Chromecast, and the apps that I want to use on the HDTV do not work with Chromecast. So there is literally no way to connect this tablet to my HDTV. Very frustrating and very hard to understand why this is the case."}

I had used a 7\" Tablet on a long journey to listen to songs and read epub books (Aldiko) and it was a very pleasant experience. 7\" form factor is lightweight, compact and great.

Great features , sufficient onboard storage (8 GB) with the ability to add a 32 GB SD card (in which I did) for more room to store music , pictures , etc. With Google Maps installed , the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 can also be used as a GPS device as well. This can also be used with a Bluetooth keyboard as well. A great tablet for the money !!"}

The tablet does support the aptX bluetooth protocol despite not being listed on the websites etc on the topic, the aptX logo is right on the back of the box for this tablet (see photo).\n\nStreaming works great to my&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/NAD-D-3020-Integrated-Amp/dp/B00F0OMUGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">NAD - D 3020 Integrated Amp</a>&nbsp;which also supports aptX.\n\nI will say initially I experienced some very frustrating issues with wifi on this tablet and my home network setup which was pretty standard.  There are numerous similar instances described by people in forums etc just google it.  The fix that seemed to work on my end was to change the security protocol on my Airport Extreme router to WPA/WPA2 which enables both the newer AES and older TKIP encryption.  Previously I had it it just on the AES option.  I also had to do a hard reset of the tablet.  Once that was done and the setting change it seems to work well on wifi."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "Don't get me wrong, I like this tablet. I just don't \"love\" it.\n\nThe screen is nice and large for a 7\" tablet. The color saturation is very nice and pleasant to read. Cranking up the visibility all the way looks brilliant (although not recommended as it will drain the battery faster). I set it to about 80% and its just fine.\n\nBattery life is very good. Its way better than my HP Venue 7\". I'd say thus far the battery lasts at least another 20-30% more than my typical use of my Venue. By design, it is much thinner and in turn lighter. Its my go to tablet now replacing my old Apple iPad 2 which is a klunky and tires out my hands because it is too heavy if holding onto it for long periods.\n\nWhat I don't like about the Tab 4 is the hard button location. It is fixed at one end of the tablet in portrait mode. Most of my usage is in landscape mode. If you ever used an Android tablet, you know the navigational buttons appear in software menus along the bottom edge of the screen in the appropriate mode. You always know to just tap the bottom edge and the menu appears. But not with the Galaxy Tab 4. This poses a problem when you are using the tablet at night in a dark room! You can't see the buttons. Samsung should have lit up the buttons to make them visible. Or better yet, just leave the software menu navigation in place by default. For those who use an Android cell phone, you are not going to like this.\n\nThe other problem with having these buttons along the inner bevel is that you can hit them by mistake. There is not a lot of bevel real estate available along the sides of the tablet. There has been so many times that I have been holding the tablet in landscape mode where i accidentally touch the buttons that it triggers their action modes. This is really a bad design in my opinion and why I give this 3 stars..\n\nAnother thing I don't care for is the layout of all the apps on the screen. There is no way that I can find how to sort the apps by name. Because they are randomly ordered its a real pain in the butt to try to find the appropriate app. Eyeballing left to right, top to bottom, and swiping across multiple screens is a really poor way to search."}

Note to Kindle owners: After I had the new tablet and figuring I had nothing to loose I hit the reset to factory settings button and now my Kindle works perfectly and most everything had been saved in the cloud.\nThe Galaxy is a nice size and pretty fast. Goole part of it is nice at times. Nice to be able to speak to it and have it talk back with the answer. What I don't like is how the icons move around, you set the pages up the way you want and after some use they seem to rearrange themselves. I' m sure that to the younger generation this is all 2nd nature and I will figure this out given enough time but the Amazon products just seem so intuitive and I guess I got spoiled. I just wish Amazon would spend more time developing the products they have instead of rushing out the next new thing. The fire phone was a great phone, basic, but for a couple hundred bucks and the option to buy it unlocked and not have a contract created a real value. Too bad they didn't stick with it. Anyway, I give 3 stars for not being very intuitive and not much in the way of tutorial. However, if you grew up with this format the Galaxy may be a a good tab for you.\n\nThe Galaxy tab is a great size, pretty fast, and Ilike the Goole part of it.  Great to to be able to speak into it and ask a question and have it talk back to you. Pretty handy at times.\n\nDecided to move up to the S2 9.7. Will review later. Saw I could trade in the Tab 4 to Amazon for about $48. Sent it in in perfect condition with a nice case and original power cord. They sent it back saying\" no accessories received\". I went on Amazon to complain although I knew they would deny my side but at least wanted to say they have problems at the trade in department. Spent a lot of time only to find not only is there no way to phone them, but no way I can find to even email them (not that a human being would read it anyway). I am a huge Amazon fan, Prime member for probably 10 years. Very disappointed I can't even contact. Just a tip-do not waste timer with the trade in option, or trying to contact someone at Amazon."}

When it came back on, the display was blank and black. The only reason I could tell it was on was by pressing the Home button to see that the backlight comes on. I contacted Samsung and had to factory reset the tablet.\n\nOnce that issue was resolved, the tablet began to disconnect, then reconnect to Wi-Fi every 30 seconds or so. Contacted Samsung again and another factory reset. If the issue happened again, they referred me to the Samsung experts at Best Buy. As luck would have it, the Wi-Fi issue began again as well as the screen issue.\n\nI went to Best Buy and they were going to attempt to flash the tablet. I received a model that was not serviceable in the US. The Samsung guy pointed out that instead of saying \"Model\" on the back, it said \"Modelo\". Also, there was a \"NOM\" logo/icon on the back that was not on the Galaxy Tabs in store. Since it was unable to be flashed, the only resolution I was given was to return the tablet for a refund, although it was well within warranty.\n\nI'm sure this is an isolated incident, but this was my experience with the tablet. I'll purchase one from Best Buy instead, just to be sure if anything happens, it will be able to be fixed in the US."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "tl;dr: Not ideal for high-end modern mobile games, very comfortable design for casual use, low on memory (get a 16GB or higher Micro SD card), was shipped two devices with dead pixels.\n\nI work in the gaming industry and I have very frequent exposure to mobile devices, but the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 was the very first tablet that I purchased for personal use.  I originally purchased this device hoping it can at least run Star Wars Uprising, which I learned that it does, but not do very well, but for the price I paid, I somewhat expected this.  The device is pretty sleek and lightweight and has been fantastic for watching Netflix/Amazon Videos, Email, Facebook/Facebook Messenger, and random Googling.  I would recommend getting at least a 16GB micro SD card because the tablet lacks memory.\n\nLong story:\nThe real problem follows my experience with Samsung's support agents and their lack of understanding with mobile devices (primarily their own) as well as their own policies.  I've read many critical reviews on Amazon warning about their Customer Service, but you see that with any product so I continued with my purchase.  My device arrived with a dead pixel and while it didn't affect the functionality and mostly forgotten, I decided one day to look into the Samsung policies regarding how a dead pixel gets serviced.  My search ultimately led to me contacting their support personnel through the Samsung chat, which I was able to engage with an agent immediately.\n\nI explained that I had purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 on Amazon a week ago and it arrived with a dead pixel and I while it's just a minor aesthetic problem, I was wondering if they can do anything about it.  The agent didn't attempt to outline my options and went into straight into \"script mode\" and began instructing me to do extraneous tasks (which I was respectful compliant about until a point), such as: restarting the device, insuring the OS was up-to-date, plugging the device into a wall socket, and then eventually suggesting that I reset the device to factory settings.  All this for a dead pixel!  At this point I made clear of my technical background and my understanding of the standard procedures of technical support (because I do both) and was very certain these resetting my device to factory settings was not going to resolve my issue.  He then instructed me to go to a URL to report my issue, which didn't load and he asked me to try to install a different browser to try again.  When it didn't work he asked me to try another computer---didn't work.  In the end he decided it was best that he filled it out for me, which I wish I knew was an option before spending 25 minutes installing different web browsers on two different computers.  And the end he told me to take it to a Best Buy for a free replacement.  This whole conversation took 40 minutes so when I was asked to fill out a survey over their service, I decided to keep it up to get back to later.\n\nI went to Best Buy and explained the situation to one of their Geek Squad personnel.  He quickly knowledged my story and told me they would replace my device, but unfortunately because I bought the device from Amazon, the device they have has a different SKU from the ones they have in stock and they are not able to take in the device for exchange.  However, the agent mentioned I should be able to get a replacement from Amazon without any hassle, which in retrospect I should have done in the first place.  On my phone I was able to get a replacement sent to me after only a few seconds of navigating.\n\nI returned home content that a resolution was on the way, I filled out the Samsung survey with a disapointment rating, which they never received, due to an error saying something along the lines of \"survey no longer valid\".\n\nI really wanted to help improve their customer service by giving them my feedback with my experience so I decided to contact Support again to explain what happened.  After doing so, the Support personal went into \"script mode\" as well and began asking me about the details about my device and attempted to instruct me to doing other things with my device even though I have already referenced my Support Ticket that should have shown that we've been through this process already.  At that point I just left because I've consumed way too much time dealing with Samsung Customer Support.\n\nAmazon shipped me a new device before I could ship my defective one back.  Unfortunately, the new unit had a dead pixel too!  At this point I consumed way too much time that I care for that I'm just going to deal with having a tablet with a dead pixel and look into dropping the extra cash for an Apple device."}

Only time i use my laptop anymore is when i have to do heavy duty typing, organize my pictures and music, and when i want to print something.  Emails, skype, net surfing, do it all on tablet.\n\nIf you are used to apple products and never worked on Android product, it will take a bit of time to get used to, so it will require some patience.  It seems like everything is customizable.  Pro is you can personalize it to almost exactly how you want it to function. Con is that you have to go through so many setup options to get there. Default setting is okay, but definitely spend some time on setup to conserve battery and turn off annoying notifications.  If you are not familiar with Android and don't want to mess with setup much, apple maybe a better choice.  But don't discount this option just yet.\n\nGoogle play (app store) is setup to auto update all apps. It seems to slow down device and sucks battery. To turn it off, go to Google play store, setting (top left corner of the screen), and turn off auto update apps.\n\nScreensize is about x4 of iPod touch screen (not the whole device, just screen)  A person with a larger smartphone may think 7 inch tab is just an extra large smartphone without phone and be unsatisfied.\n\nNot a fan of the soft keyboard, but you can download different keyboard apps to solve the issue.  Two things i do like are: numbers are part of the main keyboard, and language option.  So many languages.  I can type japanese just like on a regular keyboard, which is huge.  (I still haven't found a keyboard app offers this AND has better english typing experience)\n\nOne cool thing about this tab (maybe if this is standard in all tabs??) is you can set up different users like computer.  Everything is completely split.  Even pictures you take won't be available for another user to view (though for our case we wish it was a  shared album)\n\ncamera is ok. Low light takes poor picture, but just change the mode to night and it improves quality quite a bit.\n\nIf you have decided to buy this product, make sure to also purchase:\nScreen protector\nTablet case\nMini SD card\n\nmini SD card, so that you can move downloaded apps to it to save storage. If you have a card inserted, all pictures you take will be automatically saved on the SD card.  The tab comes with 8GB storage, and the mini SD card i got for 10 dollars on amazon adds 32GB more.  Tab comes with pre-installed apps you cannot get rid of, so 8GB doesn't go very far.\n\nPackaging was eco friendly with 100% post consumer recycled paper, printed with soy ink.  100% recyclable. This was not expected and was a big plus for me.\n\nIf you are like me who wants hands on experience before deciding, go to your local store and play with it first.\n\nI think this is a perfect tab for a beginner with tight budget like us.  The price has come down so much since now there is a newer tab called S, but it still seems like a very well built product and i am very satisfied with my first time tablet purchase and experience.\n\n***addtitional info as of 12/26/2016. About storage, fun apps, and more\nThis tab has Android 4.4.2, Kitkat. What i have read says that starting with this operating system they started preventing some Apps to be moved to SD card.  I downloaded photo edit app, which i was able to move to SD card, but the photo i edit won't save on the card. I downloaded an app that imports library from my iTune account but it won't save the music on card. The reason for this restriction is speculated to be in effort to promote and encourage consumer to use Cloud service.  2 years of service is offerred for free with this tab (or maybe for a new samsubg user?) Anyway, i worked around to save music on SD card, and it is fine, just take extra time.  There are some apps that helps you move these non-movable apps, (search under SDCARD FIX), but it doesn't solve all issues and some required more tech involvement than i was willing to invest my time on.\n\nIF you are trying to hook up your tablet to a mini projector or any HDMI, this tablet doesn't support the functionality.  There is no adaptor out there that could do that either.  I believe newer device supports it, but you have to make sure you check whether HDMI is supported or Video Out is supported for it to work.  This is one big disappointment for me.\n\nIF you are trying to download Apple Music, this device is currently isn't compatible either.  the Apple Music app is in Beta stage, so it may change, but i won't be surprised if it just ever doesn't get supported. Seems as though there is a lot of limitation built into this device.  I was buying this to test out to see if we like a tablet in our household.  Now I see all the things a tablet could possibly do, I wish it did all of that.  With that said, if I had known all of this and I would like having tablet around my household, I would probably have shelled out 50+ dollars to buy newer tablet so that I could do a lot of things that this tablet isn't letting me do.\n\nI think I got greedy with functionality. This tablet still is good for the price and if you aren't looking for the tablet to do all the things that $200+ tablet would do for you, this is still a really good tablet. :)\n\nNow let's make the most out of this cool little device.  Here are some free fantastic fun apps to consider downloading:\nPocket - any online materials you may want to read later, just \"share\" via Pocket (instead of facebook, twitter, and such), and the article will be saved on your Pocket app and read it offline.  Youtube videos are viewable  when you have internet connection only.\n\nSony sketch-turn your tab into a drawing board, sketch pad, canvas, and create your own scrapbook page, greeting cards, and simply let your inner artist come through and shine!  This is a far better app than game apps if you are looking to kill time.\n\nPhoto Director-this app does so much and take your already-proud-of pics to a whole another level!  It can also make your less than ordinary picture  a piece of art!\n\niSyncr - if you are still a iTune lover and you have lots of music on iTune but you want the library on your device, this app will do the job for you.  The free version will limit you to transferring 100 songs per transfer, but you can do as many transfers as you need to.  Also you will have to transfer the music to the device first and then move the music files to the SD card afterwards - it's due to the whole SD card thing I talked about earlier.  Yes, it's not as convenient, but it still works, and the transfer is fast.\n\nMusixmatch - this is an app that shows you lyrics of the music you are playing from your music library.  It's cool.  There is a function that works just like Shazam, music identifier and also displays lyrics at the same time.  This app is actually a really cool music player app, so instead of using the built in music player app, I use this app as default.\n\nCrackle - shows Sony Entertainment TV shows and movies.  Selections are not anything like NetFlix or anything like that, but it's FREE!  I love watching Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, which is Crackle Original and hosted by Jerry Seinfeld.\n\nAvast products - they are really good app to keep your device protected, cleaned up, saves battery, and it's free!  Install Avast Mobile Security, Avast Battery Saver, and Avast Cleanup.  It's amazing how much junk get saved and take up your limited memory by simply browsing internet and Play Store"}

The Samsung is plenty fine for what I use it for: reading newspapers while riding the train home from work. Can't read it while taking the train TO work, however. It's way too early in the morning to be doing anything that engages the brain.\n\nThe only reason I took off a star is that it's just a little too big and heavy for one-hand operation."}

I typically use my cell phone for everything, but I wanted something bigger without having to get on my laptop all of the time.  I own a kindle fire and I wanted something new.  I am a stay at home mom for the time being and when baby is sleeping, I like to catch up on my shows. The picture quality is wonderful and clear. I downloaded multiple apps and they downloaded fine without any problems. I also like that you can add user accounts to this and each account can be personalized. So, I can set up my own email account to receive notifications under my account and my husband can download his stuff under his account. This tablet pretty much reminds me of a bigger version of the Samsung galaxy s5-s6 phones. I gave this tablet 4 stars due to the camera quality. If you are in a room that isn't super bright the pictures look grainy. However, if you are a person that doesn't really use the tablet for taking pictures then this should be perfect for you. The battery life on this is really great. I binge watch shows sometimes (don't judge me lol) and the battery will last for 2 days. If I am just browsing the internet and not watching shows the battery will last even longer without being charged."}

Although it was free there is a $10 a month fee, $45 activation fee, plus the counter person snuck in a warranty even though I denied coverage. Therefore it is not free. This thing is awkward to hold and takes lousy photos. Every one of them a grainy image. No where to hold it without a finger or thumb clicking on something I didn't want clicked.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "BE WARNED!  This is an 8gb tablet, but you only get about 3.5gb space for personal apps after all the bloat that Samsung puts on it that you cannot uninstall without rooting it.  The camera is ok, but you shouldn't be using a tablet to take pics anyway.  My Note 3 blows this away for space and camera, other than the size.  For the price it's a great idea for simple web, email, calendar, and basic use.  Don't expect much of it, and you'll like it.  I made the mistake of not realizing how much I really wanted to use this as my main go to rather than my Note, other than phone and messages.  This is a great price point for what it is, but again, don't expect much of it.  I've already ordered another tablet with more RAM and memory to replace it, and I've only owned it a few days.  The only reason I'm not returning it is because I hate returns, and it does what it said it would. It's really more of a tablet for your child, which is what this will become after she grows out of her Sprout Cubby tablet. -- Edit - I did end up returning this for an Asus Zen tablet that is slightly bigger and 4 times the memory for less than twice the price.  The memory issue just bothered me too much and by the time my daughter is ready for a tablet like this I'm sure newer stuff will be out."}

Love that you can pick wallpaper which you can't do with Kindle Fires which are the only other tablets I've owned. Of course, if you want a tablet\nmainly for books, Kindle is the tablet you want. I also love all the apps you can get with the Samsung. What I don't like is the 8gb storage. I was under the impression if you got the 32gb  extra it would integrate with the tablet rather than just be like a drive for mp3s and such. 8 gigs is barely enough for the apps you need. Also the manual tells you nothing about how to add things to the extra drive.  Had to go to you tube. My tablet has connection issues from time to time.\nI still really  enjoy it most of the time. It can be super fast and plays things well from the cloud. Very light and attractive.\n\nI am returning tablet. 8 gbs is just not enough. Extra storage cumbersome to use and doesn't work half of the time.  Not easy like the cloud. Speakers unimpressive. I am disappointed because I thought I would like the Samsung. Also a battery hog. Will try the nexus 7."}

Having said that, this is a nice little tablet for the price as long as you keep it simple.\n\nPROS:\nCrisp display and at 7\" a nice viewing area.  Steams movies well with very minimal issues.\nComes with quite a few bells and whistles (so-so camera, assortment of apps, and some nice features such as weather updates and news)\nGreat for reading newspapers, books, and surfing non-graphic intensive web pages.\n\nCONS:\nVirtually no storage area, buying an expansion card is almost a must\nNot powerful enough to play any graphic intensive apps.  Tried playing a simple app like Simpsons Tapped Out and it's very choppy and stutters.\nNot a fan of the button placement but getting used to it.\n\nOverall I'm happy with it.  I got it as a handy tablet to look up information quickly without going upstairs and starting my desktop computer.  Yes, it has it's limitations but I didn't spend $500 either."}

I chose this product over others to save money, but I should have spent the extra money and gone with quality. I bought one at first in August. Within a few days it was slowing down, freezing and then not connecting to the internet. I bought it in a store and they refused to exchange it at first, saying that something was wrong with my internet. I told them that I had the same problems at work and home with different networks and that my Samsung Galaxy S5 phone was working great on the same networks. Then the guy cleared up my memory and said that I had too many apps that was slowing it down. Such crap!!! I went back the next day and demanded an exchange since apparently a refund was not an option. I got another tablet. It worked a little faster since I reduced tge number of apps on it. Bought an HDMI adapter to watch Netflix from my tab unto my Hi def tv ( not a smart TV). It didn't work. I thought something was wrong with the new product, but it was my tab since it worked well with my phone. Now its November and the tab refuses to connect to Netflix while my phone does. I'm so tired of this stupid product. I'm not sure if its because its too slow. I have saved a few documents on it. Maybe that is affecting its speed. I'm fisappointed Samdung has such a pathetic product. It had good potential!"}

But there are a few drawbacks which would lead me to not recommend it. First, the camera is mediocre at best, which was surprising considering how good the camera is on the Galaxy phones. But the biggest issue I have with this tablet is the internal storage. It only comes with 8GB, which is actually only about 4GB when you factor in the space required for the system to run. So you only have 4GB of internal storage to work with, which gets eaten up very very quickly with apps and photos/videos. So you will need to purchase a memory card to expand your internal memory, factor that into your purchase. But even with that, it doesn't really solve the problem. You can move apps to the SD card, which frees up space, but you have to do it manually every time you download an app, it doesn't happen automatically. And even with that, certain apps (like the pre-installed Google Apps, most of which I'll never ever use), can't be moved to an SD card. My son has had the tablet for just over 2 weeks and the space problem is constant, even after purchasing a 32GB SD card."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I bought this tablet at Costco over a year ago. At first I really liked it but it only came in white and that took some getting used to. Many people complain about TouchWiz but it hasn't bothered me. I also don't use it though. Lately it's been feeling a little sluggish as I've become accustomed to doing more with it, however I'm also a power user.\n\nThere is one glaring problem with this tablet that surprisingly few people mention but that you can easily find with a Google web search and it's totally mind boggling that it has this problem: the buttons. They're at the bottom of the screen as if you'd be holding it portrait when likely everyone while be using it landscape. Older tablets had no physical buttons so they moved on screen when you rotated the tablet. The Note series has them on the side as you'd expect to be holding the tablet that direction. But not the Tab 4, they're on the bottom and it drives me nuts!!\n\nWhy is it such a problem? You have to reach other them to use the screen and they're capacitive sensors so you don't even have to touch the buttons to active them, not that it's hard to accidentally do that either. I'm constantly exiting out of programs or bringing up the list of programs and it's a real hassle when you're trying to play a game and it has to reload afterwards. There's no way around this problem except to root the tablet as far as I can tell, which would invalidate the tablet against software updates in addition to being an unsuitable solution for a majority of the buyers. It would be really wonderful if the buttons could be disabled in landscape mode or if on screen buttons would appear instead. It's soooo annoying!!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This tablet makes a nice video player but has three significant problems:\n- Samsung does not release software updates. Every month new security bugs are found in Android that only get fixed in Google Nexus devices and the nicer Android phones. Galaxy Tab tablets as far as I can tell do not get security updates, so every month it gets more and more risky to browse the web or even open emails on this tablet. UPDATE: the Sprint cellular-ready version, model SM-T237P, has 16 GB of RAM and can be updated to Android 5.1 even without any cell service, but the WiFi-only version with 8 GB of RAM, model SM-T230NU, is stuck with Android 4.4 including several security flaws.\n- The tablet is sluggish. While video playback is alright, many apps run slowly.\n- 8 GB storage is not enough. In theory many (but not all, not even most) apps can be moved to an SD card, but I have found that none, not even major apps like Facebook and Kindle, are able to be moved to the SD card. Android needs at least 16 GB of storage to work well. UPDATE: see note above. At least one seller here is shipping the cell-ready Sprint model which has 16 GB (even though this listing is for the WiFi-only version)."}

The first thing you'll notice is there isn't the lag that the tab 3 had. Picture looks great and most games will run with no problems many of which weren't compatible with the tab 3. For an affordable android tablet look no further. They hold up to constant gameplay without any of the glitches the tab 3 had. All of them are still holding strong in the hands of my kids which says a lot. Is it comparable to a high end tablet? No, but you are definitely getting your moneys worth. For playing most app games, browsing the net, fb, and whatever else they want to do with them it is an affordable option. Not going to complain about the camera or other small things since what it comes with is more then acceptable for the tablet cost. If you want a top of the line tablet get one. But for the money and features offered without any of the tab 3 issues like charging problems, random shutting down and not turning on, easy to break screen. The tab 4 has none of those issues and makes a nice entry level tablet affordable."}

On the positive side, it is a great size for commuting and can easily be held in one hand but the is pretty much where the good stuff ends.  On the bad side, the display is only 1200 x 800 which is not that great for watching video. I also found screen glare to be a big problem when trying to view videos outside.  Second, there is a ton of bloatware on this device which you simply cannot delete.  Too much memory is devoted to junk software nobody wants and you are left with just a few Gigs of memory free for other stuff.  You can add an external SD card but as others have said, there isn't much you can actually move from the device to the card due to the version of Android OS this thing runs.  I did some more research and ultimately decided on the Asus Zenpad S 8\" with 64GB of memory and 2048 x 1536 display.  It costs almost $300 but was worth it."}

Samsung says this model includes a snapdragon processor but with a little research I see it has a Marvell processor instead. This may be the reason that there are few to no real custom roms for the device. As of this writing there is no Lollipop upgrade from Samsung for the 7inch model. This is disheartening because the first thing I did after firing the tablet up was to install a custom recovery and root access, which was easy. I might just give this one to the wife and buy a bigger model with more support from Samsung. This model comes with Kit Kat 4.4.2. My Galaxy S3 runs 4.4.4 so... yeah just something to think about."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "Bought it for my wife as a gift, but I first tried it for a couple of weeks, and it's simply an awesome Tablet. The best I have ever purchased and tried. Great quality in video, photo, sound, (everything you can think of), wifi range is spectacular, I can get wifi signal even where a Samsung Galaxy Note5 can't get it. There are absolutely no cons for this tablet.  All are pros. 6-stars rating for manufacturer and seller. And for the price, you won't find any other like it in the market. An extra information for consumers is that in specs says it only supports up to 32 Gb of microSD card, but in fact, if you use a Samsung  64 GB microSD card (Samsung 64GB EVO Class 10 Micro SDXC) of up to 48 MB/s, also sold by Amazon for just $23.98 dollars, but I bought it somewhere else at a higher price, It will work flawlessly. I didn't try a 128 Gb microSD card, so I cannot account for it."}

This tablet has nice resolution and reasonable battery life.  I don't like the \"bloatware\" it is loaded with or the fact that it all updates with no prompts to allow updating them, but that is actually related to android and Google I think.  My other complaint is the lack of being able to control touch sensitivity.  I have big hands and a heavy \"touch\" which results in starting apps or changing pages inadvertently far too often."}

The battery port was scratched up and when I tried plugging it in to charge, you had to hold the charger a certain way or else I would not get a connection. The company that sold me this was very understanding  and offered to even exchange the tablet free of charge. The new tablet I recieved works amazing. It is very user friendly and came in perfect condition. The charging port works as well. I'm giving a four star review because of the inconvenience I had to go through in order to replace the original item I recieved. However, the product itself works amazing. I have no complaints about the table what so ever."}

I bought this as a replacement. After 6 weeks of occasional/light use, the screen has irreversible burn-in and it's now useless. It was set to timeout after 30 seconds of idle time, so it was not a usage issue. Also felt the processor to be sluggish and even candy crush had some delay. Movies won't play smoothly.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "So I have had this tablet for about a week. I bought my first one from Walmart and my girlfriend ended up liking it so much I bought her one off here. Hers hasn't came yet but I figured since hers is the same exact model that I should give a review on this tablet. I find this tablet to be a good buy for the money because first of all its thin and light. Is it as thin as a iPad air? No its not but its thin enough and small enough to where I don't feel this when I carry it around to the store with me or to a friends house. Its about twice as thick as a iPad air 2 but twice as light (at least thats what I think). I also REALLY like how the back isn't some shinny crappy plastic that smudges and scratches really easy. It has a very nice textured back that feels really good to hold in the hand. One thing of many things I don't like about the physical design is that Samsung still uses that fake chrome looking design around the tablet. I wouldn't mind this to much if it didn't chip so easy. On the second day I have had it the chrome looking plastic chipped it bummed me out a little bit because I am very careful with any tablet, phone, laptop and really anything computer like because I understand how easy it is to break them. The other thing that I don't like at all is that for some weird stupid reason Samsung decided to put the only speaker on the back of the device. I don't like this because since it is so small its easy to cover up with your finger or hand and once you do you won't hear a thing. Just because the speaker is small don't mean its not loud. I do like the speaker itself because for such a small thing it is pretty loud you just got to make sure you don't cover it up when you are using your device. I do like the speed overall most apps load quickly and run without a problem. You have to keep in mind that this is a budget friendly tablet so don't expect to play some demanding 3D apps because its not made to replace your Galaxy S2 tablet or your iPad air. Its made to be affordable with decent specs and thats what this has. I have played angry birds, fieldrunners, air hockey, chess, ect. Overall the performance is great with these games. One thing I did notice is that it is a tad slow when it comes to using a browser like chrome or the stock Android browser. What I mean by this is that when I swipe up on my tablet to go down on a web page it takes close to a second to execute the task. Its not bad enough to make me not like the tablet its just annoying sometimes. I do like the screen. Its has a resolution of 1280 by 800 so it won't set the world on fire but its good enough to work for me. Color reproduction is great and the screen is nice and bright I also like how I can look at the screen from different angles without having to deal with polarization. The cameras on here are fine I don't expect much at all when it comes to the camera quality because this tablet is a lower priced tablet. The back camera can record 720p video and the front I believe can record 480p. So video calling should be fine selfie pictures will suffer due to the lack of camera quality. This tablet does not support OTG which was another small bummer but oh well Im glad this tablet has a micro SD card slot which can take up to 64 GB!! Yes I have tried this and it works with no problems. One HUGE plus about this tablet is that battery life is just flat out amazing! I can get around 2 to 3 days of normal use (web browsing, playing some games, watching SOME youtube, going on Facebook) and get a day with heavy use (youtube for hours, gaming for hours). Standby time is really good to if I have the tablet on all day in standby with 100% Id only lose 2 to 3%. I ended up buying a otter box for this tablet for $40.00 today and so far I am really liking the otter box. It don't add a ton of weight and I love knowing that my cool little tablet will be protect from any falls and scrapes. I will do a separate review on the otter box sometime soon. So far I think Samsung is doing a great job with there tablets. I bought the Galaxy Tab A 9.7 inch with the S pen about a month ago and its working wonders its very fast, the screen is bright and I love the screen ratio and size of the screen. I have also reviewed the Galaxy Tab A so if anyone is interested in reading it just click on my profile and then click on reviews by me. But back to the star of the show. I feel like the Galaxy Tab 4 7 inch is a great buy if you want something to play some lite games, to watch youtube, browse the web, check email, read books and really just anything simple. If you are looking for a tablet to game with Id recommend the Galaxy Tab S2 or iPad air 2 both have higher resolution screens, much faster processors and better graphics with a higher price tag.  Below I will list the pros and cons about this tablet.\n\nPros\n1. Very small and light making it easy to type with 2 hands.\n2. Better build quality than the Galaxy Tab 3 7 inch\n3. Micro SD card slot can support up to 64 GB (I have tried this)\n4. Very good battery life. About 2 days use\n5. Good standby time\n6. Bright, crisp screen with decent resolution (215 PPI)\n7. Speaker is loud for such a small speaker\n8. The price is right! LOL\n\nCons\n1. Speaker is placed in a stupid location\n2. Chrome plastic chips easy\n3. Can lag using a browser\n4. Cant update to Lolli pop without rooting it"}

It may seem like a lot, but when you add up snapchat, tumblr, skype, instagram, and kik, you don't have room for the photo editing apps, or music or photos!!! When I go to update an app, I have to delete a ton of stuff. It says to consider deleting an app.... I delete an app and then I restart it to make sure the device recognized that I deleted something... and it says I STILL have no storage. So I delete another app. STILL not enough storage!!! It sucks it up! Plus, when it says this device has, what, 8 gb, it uses  5 for system storage (what it needs to run), and yeah, I can add 1 mb to its storage, but guess what, it does JACK!!!! Nada!!!\nAlso, the speaker sucks. Its soooooooo tiny, and it has the worst quality! Kindle has better sound quality, which is what I had before (the screen broke, RIP). Don't get this one. Just do yourself a favor and get a surface pro or a Kindle (kindle doesn't have a ton of apps that are on other devices, but just download one mobile market off the net').

Works great for Skype and many other programs.  Wireless connection is fast.  Overall a good tablet.\n\nThe stock video player is a bit wonky, in that it's hard to go forward or back - the same is true when watching online videos.  I also don't care for how Samsung \"groups\" programs. When I group apps on my LG phone, they come together in a folder icon, whereas this tablet will cluster them in a hodge-podge.  Not annoying enough to kill the sale, but there are better arrangements.\n\nMy only complaint - which technically isn't the fault of the tablet itself - is that it comes with a ton of bloatware, or perhaps, just things that I'm not going to EVER use.  These items are not removable, nor are they able to be moved to my storage card.  The system memory and base apps, along with the 12 - 15 apps I've added, now only give me 1.5 GB of open space.  Which seems to be okay - until I want to download an Amazon movie for an upcoming flight.  Suddenly, I'm out of space.  You have to be very discerning with which apps you want to load and which you don't need.\n\nYes - I did know that it was only an 8GB machine when I bought it, but I had no idea that the base system would gobble up so much of that space and that none of the pre-loads could be removed (which I think stinks)"}

Maybe it's my device but I'm surprised that so many reviewers gave this more than 1 star unless they don't browse the Web. Returning it today after 30 days of hopeful but unhappy testing."}

Screen responsiveness is terrible, as I have to hit icons several times for them to open. Scrolling in Google Chrome is painfully slow, herky-jerky, and almost unstable. Google Chrome is not even rendering sites in mobile. The UI is god awful. An example: the Contacts app splits between a list and the card--thus rendering both cut in half, and hard to see. Color interface on the Calendar is like a child's dream--atrocious rainbow of pastel Smarties colors. Buttons to start, and volume rocke,r are also unresponsive. I'm thinking of sending this back. By comparison, my last tablet was a Nexus 7 (2013), that was fantastic. Also I use a Nexus 6 mobile phone--again, wonderful.\n\nI should also add that the screen resolution on this Samsung is not sharp. And here's what's notable: the Tab 4 has a very good build, feels solid."}

For the size & features at this price point, the product seemed like a no-brainer.\n\nI'm afraid to say that after using this tablet for a few days, I'm literally shocked at how horrible this thing is. Menu response, app loading, and page changes are all incredibly laggy and slow. But the worst part is the sluggish, stuttering screen performance, especially when scrolling. Pages like Facebook, tumblr, and news sites that use WordPress styled infinite scrolling are absolutely painful to use. Every attempt to scroll up or down results in jerky page movement that is just agonizing to look at.\n\nWith the surging popularity of Galaxy tablets & sales of these units in the millions, I assumed they must be a viable alternative to the iPad. But after using one I can only conclude that they must be popular because they are cheapnot because they're any good.\n\nIf I can't return this thing to Amazon it's going on eBay faster than you can say \"junk.\""}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I purchased the Samsung Galaxy 4 Tab last week and would just like to share with you, this tablet is the greatest electrical device that I have ever owned!  Its easy to carry around and work, even stupid people could use it. One of the best things about this tablet is the amazing selfie ability, this thing has a great front camera that makes you want to take selfies all day long.  The back camera and video taping is also quite excellent. I use this device on a daily bases and found that it is great for school because you can take notes, pull up the internet at anytime and I can take more selfies during my boring classes and make myself look smart. This device has incredible memory, I have room for all my favorite apps like, Instagram, Followers+,  Follower Gaining, Instafollow, Followd, Follow mania, and Get Followers and still have extra space for all of my selfies!\nI love to read, and journal on my blog, How To Get More Followers on my free time, when Im not busy selfieing.  The writing is easy, I can push each letter at a time easily, on the Ipad, the keyboard letters are way too small for my big boned fingers.  The reading is also great, you can adjust the brightness for whatever lighting or situation you are in, it is fabulous!  Several people I know own Apple devices such as the Ipad, the Samsung Galaxy 4 Tab is way better.  The Samsung Galaxy 4 Tab must be highly more intelligent and sophisticated than the Ipad, after all, it isn't named after a piece of fruit.\nWhen I listen to music I tend to never wear headphones because I rock out too intensely, they just fall right out, but, with the Samsung Galaxy 4 Tab I can just flip the device over, crank up my tunes and rock out to T-Swizzles latest break-up song as loud as I want, absolutely clearly, it is just life changing!  As for the battery, my Samsung Galaxy 4 Tab last for whole 5 hours, I only have to charge it 3 times a day and all night long when I am sleeping, you won't find a better battery life device like that in this era!  Of course I think you should purchase this awesome device sooner than later, the Samsung Galaxy 4 Tab is the best electrical device you will ever see!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I bought this product after spending time looking at many different tablets offered by other companies. I originally purchased it as a device to keep me entertained during my long flight to Europe. I have owned the product for over a year now, and although it was expensive, I think I have gotten a great value out of it. I use the tablet mostly as a device for reading books through the pre-loaded Amazon Kindle App, but also sometimes use it just to play games or check up on my fantasy football team.\n\nAdvantages:\nThis tablet runs on a very advanced, but easy-to-use android operating system. I did not have a very hard time adjusting to the way the system works even though I had been using Apple products for some time prior. The battery life of this tablet is also very good, lasting for about eight hours under heavy use,  which includes playing games, reading books, reviewing school materials, etc. The product is also very light, weighing just a bit more if not the same amount as my phone. I had a few questions when setting up my tablet and called the Samsung support team. They were very helpful and actually took control of my tablet remotely in order to answer my questions. The team is always standing by, and that is a great comfort.\n\nDisadvantages:\nI have noticed that this tablet is hard to read in the sunlight. I have taken it to the pool in order to read a book, and found it difficult to read unless I was sitting in the shade. I have yet to drop this tablet, but the fact that it is so light somewhat scares me to the point that I am not sure it would survive the fall, so I make sure to be extremely careful.\n\nOverall Assessment:\nI chose to give this tablet five stars because I absolutely love it. I have not once regretted my purchase of this product, and would be more than willing to recommend this tablet to both my family and friends."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "Be warned!\n\nAndroid version 4.4 (Kit Kat) created restrictions on what apps could be stored onto the external SD.  Hopefully we will see if 5.0 changes it.\n\nIf you thought that you would buy this tab and then get a 32-64gb micro Sd card for storage...think again.  Very few apps can be moved onto the SD card.  After Samsung puts all of their proprietary apps onto the internal storage, you are left with as little as 1gb of storage for your own apps.  The result is a tablet with a constantly full internal storage and empty external storage.  Mine filled up after adding 5 apps for work.  I was unable to install anymore apps.  That is pretty pathetic and renders any Android 8gb tablet pretty useless if you want to put more than a few apps on it.\n\nGo for the 16gb version or buy a Nexus 7 or newer 32gb (which is faster).\n\nUpdate: if you are a even little bit tech literate you can root your tablet (voids warranty) and download apps that will enable moving apps to your SD card.  This allows you to fully utilize the external storage as you ought be able to.  The tab still gets 1 star because out of the box, 8gb is not enough to have a fully functional tablet that enables you to use all of its features.  Sad that Android went the way of Apple with their tyrannical restrictions on what you can do with your own hardware."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This tablet was laggy and lacking in wifi connection consistency and response time. The screen would freeze up very often when trying to touch an app to launch, touch a text area to type, switch from the letters on the keyboard to the symbols, or even trying to enter a lock screen passcode. That last lockup would take at least 30 seconds every time with the screen flashing on and off twice. Abysmal. I know it's a fraction of the price of our old iPad Mini retina display and it has something like 6 times the RAM, but holy cats, the iPad blows it out of the water every single time in usability. I cannot go back to barely-limping-along performance. I guess there's a reason we shelled out the big bucks for the iPad (and for an entry-level Macbook Air for that matter), and that reason is probably the software Apple produces. When you want fast and responsive and reliable, vote with your wallet and don't skimp.\n\nOther negatives--the screen looked horrible after using a retina display, the internal RAM filled up in less than a day, the chrome looking plastic edging around the screen chips and dents very easily, and the back got very hot over where I'm assuming the processor is located playing a Facebook game."}

Maybe I should have done more research but i thought by now OTG support would be nothing for android tablets these days."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I received this tablet as part of a promotion, and it's honestly not bad. Sure, the camera is shoddy, there's no ambient light sensor, it only comes with 8gb storage, the speaker is tinny, and TouchWiz sucks; but, the display is bright and vivid, you can expand your storage, GNL runs well on top of TouchWiz, and, if I had paid full price for it, the price would be low enough that I wouldn't be bothered by the drawbacks.  All in all, it's a solid, if completely unremarkable, tablet that gets a lot of mileage as an e-reader, streaming movies and music to a chromecast, social media and e-mail machine, and occasional remote control.\n\nIf you need a cheap tablet to use as your living room tablet, I'd say it's good enough, for you."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I've been using Apple products since the first iPods came out.  We have a dozen Apple products all over our house and I've never had any trouble with any of them.  My reason for moving to the Samsung was 1) I like the smaller size of this tablet better than the iPad mini 2) the tab 4 was $50-$100 less.  After spending 10 years with Apple, maybe part of my dislike for the tab has to do with my familiarity with Apple?  But any of my Apple products I've owned have all seemed much more intuitive.  It took me 10 minutes to figure out how to delete an ap.  They way the windows are set up, especially as you start adding apps, seems very random.  I had apps showing up all over the place.\nThe other thing that I noticed is that the touchscreen doesn't seem to be very responsive.  Or, maybe it just takes a lot longer for the device to do its \"thinking?\"  On my iPhone the icon will light up, so I know the touch has been registered, but with the tab 4 I got nothing.  Not even just on icons, but trying to tap/touch within a page.  It seemed not to register at all sometimes.\nCompared to the iPad the camera is a waste.  I had flip phones that took better pictures.\nThe last complaint that I have is the lag.  This device is not suited for gaming, IMO.  There are a couple of games my son really enjoys on his iPad, so I installed them so that he could play them on my device as well.  One of them is a continuous game - you're a block and you have to jump over obstacles, and the lag was so bad that the game was pretty much unplayable.  He was in tears in 5 minutes because the levels that he could do on his iPad were stumping him.  Even a game like candy crush, I often had a lag in falling candy.\nThe only plus is give it over the iPad was the google play store, so not even a compliment for the device itself.  I liked that we could utilize the free apps without having to have an account.\nFor someone who has never used an apple, this device may seem fine, but, imo, you'd really be missing out if this is where you landed.  I will never buy a Samsung again."}

At 3 months, the internal speakers broke (when I put in headphones no sound plays). Also the alarm feature broke. I'd set an alarm and it'd never go off. At about 4 months it stopped charging correctly (I had to literally hold my charger to the tablet for it to charge). At 5 months it started to randomly shut itself off from the WiFi and at first I thought maybe my WiFi was just slow (even though the tablet never did this before...). So I even upgraded my WiFi and for about a week that helped but now it's too the point where it's shutting itself off from the WiFi constantly. I can't do anything with it anymore. Can't watch movies, play games, listen to music, nothing! I originally bought this because I have many friends who swear up and down galaxy tablets are the way to go. This tablet however is just trash."}

Better than kindle- much more capability, but it's a google-centric device, which is annoying for me, as I refuse to use anything Google on purpose.  I reset the damned thing 4 times before I felt comportble with the order things were donein order to protect my provacy.  However, if you want to delete your Google Play account, you loose all of your apps, so I'm not compfrtable with that.  Unlike with Kindle (same price for this as the 7\", really and you can install anything Android on it, plus it has an SD-card slot).\n\nThe screen is just as good as a regular Kindle Fire (maybe not as nice as my HDX).  Whomever said the screen isn't good enough for Kindle books must have severe vision problems.  It's exactly the same, so don't let that stop you.\n\nIf you are tired of being in the world of Amazon, decide if you want to be in the world of Google instead.  Their Play store is GARBAGE and privacy seems much more of an issue, but you can install a VPN and it has full Android capabilities unlike Kindle.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This smart phone worked like a charm for about 10 days and then it crashed, and I mean all the way. Went on the internet to look for help and tried everything possible to fix the problem. Nothing worked and I couldn't access anything. I even tried a factory reset to no avail.  I couldn't even get into the device to delete my personal info. Fortunately, during my internet search I learned how to use the 'emergency' boot (can't remember what it's called) and so was able to get into the phone that way. Amazon was amazing and gave me a full refund with no problem. Thank you Amazon! I would like to say though that I think I may have just gotten  a lemon. I had done a lot of homework before I purchased and had read many positive reviews. Nevertheless, based on my personal experience with the phone I must give it one star."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "The tablet itself, while it worked, was a great product. However, my mistake was in purchasing a refurbished product. After about 3 months of use, the graphics processing unit broke making the tablet unusable and according to the Geeksquad people at Best Buy, it would cost more to fix than to purchase a brand new tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7 inch from Deals Shop and it arrived on time. But frustratingly they gave me no tracking information until the last 2 days (they basically sent it at the last 2 days and did 2 day shipping while to actually get it took the normal amount of time which was 4-7 days). When I got the package I was really excited but slightly disappointed to see that the packing in the box was very poor and the box that was holding the tablet inside was smashed up a bit. Luckily the tablet was perfectly fine but it could've easily gotten dinged during transit due to bad packing. These slight annoyances were just the specific seller Deals Shop i bought it from. The tablet itself was great! it sports a 1.2Ghz quad core arm cortex-A7 cpu and 1.5 GB of RAM, android 4.4 kitkat. the system comes with limited bloatware (which isn't a surprise because samsung is usually good with that kind if thing) and 8 gb of internal memory. the touchwiz UI is very sleek and enjoyable for normal usage and i highly recommend the galaxy tab 4 7.0 to anyone with a budget but wants a high quality tablet. In my opinion its the best tablet right now price wise. if money isn't a big deal there are MUCH better tablets out there, but this one is fine for me."}

I don't know what the issue is, and I've searched the internet for answers and haven't found any, but my Galaxy Tablet won't stay connected to our wifi and even when it is connected, it's like an internet-less wifi connection most of the time.  Trying to connect to the internet is frustratingly slow and forget trying to play games.  Huge disappointment.\n\nUpdate:  Amazon allowed me to return the original tablet I bought because of the wifi issue, which was unexpected and very much appreciated.  However, the new tablet has the same issue, so I no longer think the original one was a dud, these tablets have an issue staying connected to the internet.  Even if it shows as connected, internet and internet games can't connect."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "After my 2012 Kindle Fire HD kept disconnecting from wifi and kept giving me \"authorization failed errors\", I decided to upgrade my tablet between a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4, Nexus 7 (2nd gen) or Samsung Galaxy Tab A. The Galaxy Tab A was too expensive. Even though the specs are better on the Nexus 7, I went with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 (16gb Sprint model) because the price was actually far cheaper than Nexus 7 and I heard way too many complaints about slow down/bricking Nexus 7 after lollipop update. I have been very impressed with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4.\n\nPros:\n1. User interface is very user friendly, fast and responsive. I am a big fan of lollipop on my Moto G (2nd generation) so it was easy to get used to this operating system. This Samsung kitkat isn't that much different than a stock android lollipop like my Moto G. Samsung kitkat operating system has a lot of features and it is very easy to use. I hear that this tablet may soon get a lollipop update and that will only make it better for me.\n2. No bloatware... I heard some people complain about way too much bloatware. I don't think that is true at all. You get google apps that you can easily delete if you don't want. There are like 12 Samsung apps that you can't delete but I wouldn't call them \"bloatware\" as they are camera, calendar, galaxy apps, gallery, video, settings, etc. and I wouldn't want to delete them anyways. It isn't like you get 30 apps of locked junkware.\n3. Great picture quality screen... Don't be fooled by the 216ppi. At a 7 inch size, the picture quality looks really great. It is the same 216ppi as my kindle fire HD and that too looked great. Sure you can pay more for a better screen but I don't think it is really necessary.\n4. High quality construction... It has a nice feel in the hands and the quality is top notch. I have always been a samsung fan because they are really known for high quality and reliable products. This product is no different. I don't think Asus quality can compare and I heard many complaints about Asus costumer service too.\n5. Cost... For me, I got it on sale for much cheaper than the retail price and way cheaper than Nexus 7 too.\n6. MicroSD Card compatible... 8GB is way too little for me. I have the 16GB model and I already used 7GB of storage after installing all my favorite apps. If you want to add pictures, videos, music, etc., you will definitely need to use an MicroSD card. All tablets should be able to use MicroSD cards in my opinion.\n7. Camera... It doesn't take amazing pictures or videos but the quality is good for the very few times that I use it. I don't think camera should be a real major priority for a tablet. Phone? OK. Tablet? No.\n8. Battery life... I think the battery life is better than my Kindle Fire HD.\n\nCons:\n1. Speakers are somewhat lacking... My 2012 Kindle Fire HD has much better, clearer and far louder speakers than this 2014 Samsung Galaxy Tab 4. The speakers aren't terrible but when I did a side by side comparison, the Kindle Fire HD was really much better. This surprised me especially because my Kindle Fire HD was from 2012.\n2. Capacitive buttons... It isn't that big of a deal but I would prefer the on-screen buttons like on Lollipop. In the dark, it is hard to see but you do get used to them by feel. I guess the benefit of the capacitive buttons is that they don't take up some of the screen space like the on-screen buttons.\n\nI would highly recommend this tablet and I would give it a 4.5 stars out of 5."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "Mostly good.  I'm coming from a Samsung Galaxy S3 phone and the phone is better or the same in every area except screen size.  The 7\" screen on this is wonderful for watching YouTube videos.  But there's a catch...there's only 1 speaker in the back and some YouTube videos sound muted.  What I did was get a nice Clipster blue tooth speaker and pair that whenever I watch a video or stream music.\n\nI have a regular 802.11n router.  I did read people were having trouble on the newer band, but my connectivity is good.\n\nI like this and have in a nice otterbox case which I carry in my cargo pants pocket everyday.  I wouldn't return it though some days I'm tempted to go back to the S3 since I don't need to carry an extra speaker with that.\n\nIt has a nice strong battery.  At first I was disappointed that I couldn't replace it but I found that I typically only have to charge it every other day.  Typically I'm just using at work to check on emails with WiFi.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "Junk. So much that I can't even use it to type this review. Comparing it to a first generation iPad mini, the quad core that it claims takes exponentially longer to process apps, search on the web, pretty much everything. It freezes/delays every single time I use it, games don't work properly on the touch screen and jump glitching the entire time. These issues are not there with any apple product that I have used. I have done side by side comparisons and now the only thing I use it for is a large calculator, and even that is a bit slow. I have a 5 year old htc hero that works faster than this horrible tablet. My 4 year old Asus tablet is considerably faster. I gave it a fair chance and continue to be disappointed. The only good thing is the battery life isn't dismal. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and even my 3 year old realizes that it is junk. Very disappointed Samsung."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "First of all, I enjoy the thin wafer-like feel to the tablet. The controls are situated well and the 7-inch size is perfect, especially if you use the tablet for reading a lot. The device itself is a top quality product I would expect from Samsung.\n\nThe reason I gave it only two stars though is that the 8GB is clearly not enough space to run a reasonable amount of apps.  Samsung loads the tablet with quite a few uninstallable apps which are not necessary and which use up a lot of the 8GB of space that the tablet has on the device. The SD card that I purchased for it, which contains 20GB of space, is nearly useless due to the fact that many of the apps can't be moved to it so the problem I'm facing now is that I'm quickly running out of room on my tablet where I'm having to choose now which necessary app I need to remove. When I first purchased it several months ago, I was able to put a few apps on it for entertainment along with the apps I use for checking my mail, getting on the Internet and reading (Kindle app). I have a couple productivity apps like a task manager app, OneNote and Evernote but beyond that, they're either all pre-installed Google apps or pre-installed apps I never asked for. Thus, as the apps on the device take up more room due to constant updates, I'm finding that I'm having to uninstall apps I need that make the tablet useful."}

It is belong to Android 4.4 Kit Kat OS family with seamless transitions and features of the product.  It comes with a 1.2 GHz quad-core processor. This processor speed is enough to take care of all sorts of smart phone needs and utilities. I found this product to be quite easy and firm to hold from the point of view of grip and it tells about the makers conscious effort to design something which is comfortable and not too massive. This tablet is fantastic as it makes you replace your laptop in practically for anything.\n\nI write my letters, my text or assignments on it with quite ease. The product may not be good for those who are looking for a proper laptop but this is so because it is not a laptop and a tablet. The High-resolution, 7.0-inch display is extremely vivid in giving the details.  This device is allowing me to do all that I can. It is allowing me to read e-books, watch movies, play games, browse the web, and do much more. I am also finding the multi-user mode quite helpful as my cousin also shares this tablet with me. With the range under $150, this device is priced competitively is a great find at this price. Buy it if you want to move freely without carrying your laptop. Buy it for its sheer light weightiness."}

CPU speed is fine for basic tablet-like tasks, but the GPU is an absolute dog. Simple 2D games like Angry Birds had noticeable low frame rates compared to Nexus 7 or my basic phone.  Samsung UI is a bit much, but does have a lot of options and works well on a tablet.  The tablet fits perfectly into your hand and is light so therefore it is very comfortable to use, but the back surface is a very slippery plastic.  I know it is a budget device but this back surface makes the tablet easy to drop.\n\nIn the end, the very slow GPU and slippery surface made me return the tablet."}

When you spend this much money on technology, you would like it to last close to two years.  Only lasting 3 months, with minimal usage, is completely unacceptable.  Worst device ever!!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This is my second Samsung Galaxy Tab.  I had the Galaxy Tab 2 until it died on me.  I purchased this device because I am able to take pictures with my DSLR and then move the microSD card to the tablet to edit and upload the pictures.  This is especially useful while travelling.  Other than working with pictures, I primarily use the Tab for surfing the internet and light reading.  The Galaxy Tab 4 in comparison to the 2 is noticeably thinner and lighter.  There are two things about the Tab 4 that I wish could have been better.  The main one is that it doesn't have a strong of a connection to the wireless router.  The router is placed two rooms away from the bedroom and the Tab 4 regularly maintains only 1 bar whereas the Tab 2 connection was always strong.  I also wish that the softkeys on the bottom of the Tab 4 would light up.  Sometimes it takes a bit of hunting and pecking to find the right spot to hit for the return key.  Other than these two limitations Samsung has made a pretty good product."}

The only issue is that it drops WiFi a lot and I have tried working with my WiFi router to combat this and its been doing a lot better now. It may have something to do with a Android update not 100% sure but I am leaning that way."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I just got this today and maybe I am not using it correctly, but this is not working like I hoped it would. I wanted a tablet but no more Apple stuff. It is sloooooow as if operating through a dial up modem. Time consuming to download apps and it often doesn't complete the download. Get error messages about connectivity and my WiFi connection, yet my phone, Kindle,  laptop, and Amazon Fire work as usual. I will write to Samsung, but doubt that will result in anything positive. Frustrating device. I would not recommend this regardless of price. This is an update on July 25th.  I figured out that if I was sitting right on top of my Wifi router this thing worked like a champ.  If I got more than 20 feet away, I measured it, the device started losing connectivity.  At 25 feet and beyond useless.  I started dealing with Samsung for a fix.  I have to say I spent at least 6 frustrating hours working with those people.  It was reminiscent of the dawn of the home computer age in the 80s, spending hours on the phone with tech support.  Every phone call or electronic request you make with those people you start over.  That is to say another recital of the model number, serial number, name, phone number, etc. The on line forms are especially laborious. They acknowledged I had a problem, and sent me a \"ticket number,\" which I was to use to get further assistance.  One would think you simply referenced that number in your next communication and all of the pertinent information would be available.  Not the case, fill out another form and start over.  Samsung will attempt to convince you the issue has to do with your internet connection and/or your router.  They will want to walk you through disconnecting everything, reconnecting, rebooting, restarting, ad nauseam.  I quickly subverted this time consuming, time wasting process by telling them all other wireless devices were working fine throughout my house, including my Galaxy phone. Ultimately, Samsung agreed to let me send it in for repair.  One fellow finally admitted there is a hardware issue with the device.  They emailed me a UPS mailing label, which I couldn't print, but ultimately figured that out and sent it in.  About three weeks probably, we'll see. Update on August 2.  I received this back from Samsung in exactly one week.  I tracked the progress through Samsung's system.  The device was repaired the day they received it.  The tab works a lot better now, but still has occasional connectivity issues.  It was suggested to me to relocated my Wifi router, which I did and that has provided some help as well.  For the price, it suits my purposes now.  I still say though, if you need a reliable tablet, pony up extra $$, and find something else."}

Another reviewer mentioned that they had problems with streaming and quality and I can agree 100% with that.  We have even started having problems with the charging, sometimes it won't charge at all and other times - no problem.  The tablet will sometimes say 100% charged and you unplug it, it will drop to 30% other times it will be on the charger for several hours and not have made progress, another time is it will say a % other than 100 and when you turn it off, the screen will say 100% charged.  I'm just terribly frustrated with this product right now and wish I could return it for something else, but it is too late for us.

Netflix stutters and the video quality is poor. I have compared it side by side with other devices streaming the same video (live streams, Netflix, Youtube, etc.) and it is definitely the device, not the internet connection.  Doing some research on the streaming issue, I have found many other complaints about this issue with no resolution.  I am not sure how this tablet has such high ratings!!!  I am going to try to return this for a refund.  I am hoping that it is possible with Amazon.  So disappointing..."}

After approximately five weeks usage it has functioned without problem and has been easy to use.  My wife has found that she has been able to expand the number of things she does on the tablet (beyond what she was able to do on her Kindle) and cut back on what she does on her laptop.  Its light weight and small size allow her to carry this with her in her purse thus having it readily and conveniently accessible for use.  This little tablet is for personal, non-professional use only.  We find that battery life is sufficient for her to use the tablet all day long by charging it overnight.  She is very pleased with this tablet computer.  As this only comes with 8GB flash memory I would not recommend this unit without installing the optional 32GB memory expansion card and feel this should come as the normal, out of the box configuration."}

Nope I grab this one before my ipad mini and I feel so bad that I am neglecting my ipad mini lol\nI haven't put this down since I brought it. The fact it could fit in my pocket has won me over I really wish apple would consider this size!\nAlso the multiview has won me over 100% I can watch youtube videos and surf the web. I am truly addicted\ni have a lot of windows open on my tab and it still doesnt lag.\nFor kids its great because of kids mode and free educational apps, apple you have to pay. Apple is good for older students and buis people but for ent and browsing def, get this.\nIts 139.00 cheaper than anywhere else. I brought it at best buy for 150 with a free 20.00 gift card\nI am an apple fan for life but I cant help loving this.\nIts way more portable than the mini.\nYes you can carry the ipad mini in your purse and backpack but what if you don't feel like carrying either this can go in ur pocket real quick.\nThe ability to be able to customize your icons and etc I missed because apple limits you.\nIf you're like me and you multitask this would be great and you cant beat the price!\nInstead of getting an air get this and the mini you'll have the best of both worlds.\nFor kids this is a must, unless they are in grade school where it is required for them to have an ipad\nBut the multiscreen view will win people over and apple has tried but they have it only for their airs 2 in the fall and thats just sad. Because no one is gonna spend 500 just for that feature.\nI have the tab 3 as well and honestly that stayed in my kitchen as a recipe book. It was more bulky and thicker I rarely brought it anywhere.\nSo if you are looking to upgrade to the tab 4 from the 3 it is worth it. Its much thinner and more portable and a lot more faster!\nI think my tab 3 will be passed down to my kid instead of this lol is that wrong?\nNow the camera suckkkss!! The ipad mini has a way better camera but who really uses their tablet to film and take photos.\nI don't even bother with the camera unless I really don't have a camera with me.\nThis is worth the buy, you are not gonna go home and use it and regret buying it.\nYou will love it more and more."}

As a photographer, this size helps keep the amount of gear I carry light. It's just too bad they don't seem to think anyone wants this size anymore and don't offer the new tabs in this size. I guess with the phones getting bigger, I can see the logic. So this will probably be the most powerful 7\" Samsung tablet at least for a while. The operation is smooth and flawless. There's lots of after market accessories to choose from. The size also makes it easier to hold like a book as opposed to the larger one's where you need two hands usually. So what's not to like and why did I give only 3 stars?\n\nThis tablet does NOT support USB OTG. So the only thing you can plug in to is a power cord. Not even able to connect to your computer. Transfers to and from the computer have to use the microcard. No thumb drives, external keyboards, controllers, etc. Wow, turns out that's a deal breaker for me. I need to be able to download images from my camera to it. The older 7\" tab 3 had OTG support, the larger 8\" and 10\" tab 4's have it, but not this one.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get the SM-T235 or the SM-T237P tablet and you'll be able to connect all the devices you probably just assumed you could. Oddly enough, all the tab 4 7\" models sell for around the same on ebay (respective of condition, etc) except the 231 model which goes for a little more. But I'm not sure why as it does no more the these 230 models. Get the 237P model made for Sprint which has the OTG support, 16gb internal and LTE if you want to pay for it and if not just use it as a wifi unit. I bought a like new 237P for $85. What's really interesting is I can turn it into a phone if I want which I might do to see what it would be like. I know when enabled, this LTE is super fast since it has Sprint Spark which is said to tap into all three Sprint-LTE radios in the 800 MHz, 1.9 GHz, and 2.5 GHz frequencies."}

I just spent three hours trying to pair this tablet with a Bluetooth speaker, and it would only play about 3 seconds of audio before cutting out. Unless you're playing Name That Tune, that's absolutely unacceptable. In addition, I tested it against a pair of Bluetooth headphones afterwards. I had the headphones literally right next to the tablet, and guess what: 3 seconds of audio before cutting out, over and over again. Everything else works fine, but that's a serious flaw. Don't waste your money on this if you can find a better one."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "PROS\nBuild Quality\nBattery Life\nExpandable Storage\nPortable\nCONS\nCamera\nSomewhat laggy performance\n\n7.5 Its a mostly solid performer with  quality, is very typical Samsung with an all plastic construction and a fake leather back that still feels like plastic.  Despite its plastic construction it feels very solid and sturdy with a very nice amount of weight.  Samsung has also trimmed down their use of chrome on the Galaxy Tab 4 line up making the design look much more aesthetically pleasing.\n\nAs the name suggests, on the front is a 7.0 inch display with a resolution of 1280800.  Its not super high resolution so pixels are noticeable, but its certainly far from a bad display as its very bright with good color reproduction, easy to see outdoors, and  has great viewing angles. Internally its being powered by a 1.2 GHz quad-core processor, 1.5 GB of RAM, and 8 gigs of internal storage which will run out quickly unless you augment by micro SD expansion.  Theyre very mediocre specs and the overall performance throughout the OS is passable with very few hiccups.  Graphically demanding games are still playable but its certainly far from buttery smooth.\n\nJust like the rest of the tablet the camera is nothing to write home about.  Its a 3 megapixel fixed focus camera so photos are very low resolution meaning you won't be able to zoom and crop due to the lack of detail.  It does fairly well with plenty of light but once you take it indoors photos become grainy especially in low light and with no autofocus the camera struggles to take clear shots.\n\nThe biggest highlight of this tablet is the battery life.  Its packing a 4,000 mAh battery inside and it lasted me about 2 days under heavy usage as I primarily used the tablet for gaming with some light web browsing and social networking.  At the end of it all I wound up with slightly over 7 hours of screen on time which is quite impressive so I have no doubt this tablet could last between 3 to 4 days with average use.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 ships with Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box with Samsungs TouchWiz interface.  TouchWiz is still TouchWiz, but the version on the Galaxy Tab 4 line up is much more slimmed down.  Many features found on Samsungs more high end offerings like My Magazine and Air Gestures are not included, but all of the more useful features like multiwindow, palm swipe, and smart stay remain intact.\n\n Its small, portable, and cheaper than Samsungs PRO line but it isn't without its shortcomings."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I bought this in March 2015 for my son. He went in half and I went in half for his birthday.\n\nWe chose this tablet because of the high reviews and because it was less expensive. I was hesitant to buy a device with only 8Gb of storage because I knew it would get sucked up so fast in games, but then I found the 32Gb SD storage card and thought, no biggie. We will just dump all apps and stuff onto the external storage and it won't be a problem.\n\nThere are a lot of good things about this tablet.\n*It runs well.\n*The screen is very well lit and clear.\n*It plays Netflix and YouTube videos very well.\n\nThere is one huge issue that I do not like and that continually frustrates my son.\n*The storage issue of 8Gb EVEN though we have an additional 32Gb SD card.\n*The pre-installed bloatware that you can't get off (but you can uninstall updates and turn off).\n\nWe ran out of storage quickly. I thought, no biggie. We have the SD card. However, what I did not realize even after looking into the SD card for about 1 hour on various forums is that you either have to A) Have an app to MOVE EACH photo or video or app onto the SD card B) Go into Settings and Applications and move each app individually -OR- C) Plug the device into a computer and manually move stuff onto the SD card.\n\nI do not find the manually moving of the files convenient at all. And, now, even more frustrating, we keep getting an \"insufficient space\" when trying to install an app even though we have moved every single thing possible to the SD card. We have also uninstalled the updates and turned off all the bloatware. So I am installing yet another cleaner app and then I will try again plugging the tablet into the computer and manually moving things.\n\nI also own an iPad 3rd gen. It has a mere 16Gb of storage. When we run into storage issues, we delete apps that we haven't used in a long time. There are no caching/memory/storage issues on the iPad. You delete it. The space is back. You use it again. I have owned the iPad for 5 years without any issue. So, I am very frustrated to have a 4-month old tablet with storage/cache issues already.\n\nI think if the SD card is to be used at all in a user convenient fashion, you should get a choice of where you want to install your apps in the Google Play Store (or whatever store you choose to use) and it should be easy to switch your storage of photos and videos to the SD card. Also, when you move the app, your app data should automatically follow! As in, you should be able to go into settings and say, \"Store my photos and videos on my SD card\" and \"Store my apps on the SD card.\" and \"Store my app data on my SD card.\" Android is not making this easy. Why?\n\nAfter this, I find that had I known, I would have forked over the additional $$$ needed for an iPad or iPad mini."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I Ordered this tablet as a graduation gift for my brother. After 20 minutes of setup, my brother set it down and checked his phone. When he picked the tablet back up, the internal LCD Panel was cracked (no damage to the body or glass of the device, in fact we wouldn't let my brother use it until he had applied a case and a screen protector), the top half of the screen was moved to the bottom half, and the  top was black.\nSo I contacted customer service, was refused a replacement, but offered a repair. I didn't want to chance sending a defective device in multiple times, so I asked if I could there was any way I could get a replacement. I was given a ticket number and transferred to executive customer care. It rang twice and hung up. So, I called back, offered up my ticket number, and was transferred again.\nI spoke to a rather rude representative, who insisted that because there was some sort of physical damage to the device, the warranty was void, and I would have to pay for a repair. I explained that there was no outside damage to the device, the problem was obviously internal and not the result of any misuse. He insisted it was void no matter the source of the damage, so I pulled my copy of the warranty and asked him to show me where it said that any physical damage automatically voids the warranty, no matter the source. He pointed me to clause A of the section of what is not covered, which states that any damage resulting from misuse voids the warranty. I explained to him that my brother was using the tablet like anyone normally would, and pointed him to clause B, which states that any damage is void, unless caused by Samsung. Since the damage was internal and not from misuse, it would have to be a manufacturing fault, meaning Samsung was at fault, and it was covered for at least a free repair. He then pointed me to Clause G, stating that \"defects caused by operation\" were not covered, glossing over the \"improper\" part of that sentence, as well as the fact that that clause refers to software. I pointed this out. He insisted that his information was correct. I said he was acting upon interpretation and taking phrases out of context, and asked to speak to his supervisor. He said that they both use the same resources, I would get the same response, and hung up.\nAnyway, I kept calling and eventually ended up with a free repair, so I'm going to send it in tomorrow, but if anything goes wrong on their end, or they deem it \"irreparable\", they'll contact me and give me my \"options\", which probably means they'll hold it unless I pay $50 to get it back. I am never buying Samsung again. Spend a little more and get a Nexus 7, trust me."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This is just a preliminary review.  I got my Tab 4 on Wednesday.  I immediately started playing with it.  I fully charged it. I set it up according to my preferences. I registered it with Samsung. I paired it with Bluetooth to some of my other devices.\nI was impressed with how sharp the screens were. It was way better than the Tab 2 it replaces. It was a lot faster than my Tab 2.\nIt was delivered at about 7:30pm and after playing with it for hours, I was tired and went to bed. The next morning I wanted to try out the IR Blaster.  There wasn't one!\nI never used the IR Blaster on my tab 2, so to me, the lack of one was no big deal, however I hate to be taken advantage of and I felt that TechGiant (fulfilled by Amazon) sent me a slightly inferior product.\nTechGiant had good reviews and most customers gave them good ratings. I felt I couldn't go wrong getting my Tab 4 from them. I even gave them a 5 for fast delivery.\nAfter discovering the lack of the IR Blaster I thought about the strange things I encountered when I received this. Usually an item like this comes in a sealed box.  There was no seal on this box. Usually, there is warranty information inside. There was only a quick start guide. When I powered this up for the first time, I was greeted by some instructions written in Spanish. Fortunately I looked at the drop-down menu and figured it was telling me (in Spanish) to choose a language. Later on, all temperatures were displayed in Celsius.\nI couldn't help but think TechGiant sent me a tablet designed for another country.\nI contacted Amazon. They offered to exchange this device. At this point, I haven't decided. I have gotten items from Amazon for years and Ive returned a couple of items that were grossly problematic.\nIf I end up returning it or not, I will post an addendum in a few weeks.\nI have posted some photos illustrating some of the points I made. I have given this three stars for now.\nAddendum: After I wrote this review I looked at a photo another buyer posted.  He said that Samsung no longer included an IR Blaster in the Tab 4.  It is advertised as being included. The Amazon associate I chatted with said it is included. What gives?"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "Absolutely love this thing. I use it in the medical field to look up patient information and to have notes readily available. I like that it has a MicroSD slot where I can store all of my music, notes, and documents. Fits in my white coat, my scrub pants, and even my jean pockets very well, which makes it excellent to have on rotations since every spare moment to study counts! The battery life is EXCELLENT. If I forget to charge it one day, no big deal, it'll last me two. Though, charging it every night is a safer bet. Things that make it so affordable: lack of flash light; no automatic focus on camera; relatively poor quality cameras on front and back; screen resolution. All of these are NOT IMPORTANT. Seriously, if you need to take a photo, use your camera, or phone. Don't be THAT GUY who takes pictures with their tablet. Nonetheless, it is nice to have a camera on it, just in case you want to snap at something interesting, which I've never had to. So who cares if it's poor quality or doesn't focus automatically. The screen is supposedly, not as \"crisp\" as others, but I find it to be indistinguishable from any \"retina display\" out there. It is also extremely bright, if you want it to. Brighter than my Galaxy S3. Obviously still difficult to read in direct sunlight, but doable. The speakers are pretty descent for a tablet. Overall, it was a GREAT investment, especially for the price."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I was extremely excited about getting this tablet for my daughter for her birthday, and she was equally excited to receive it. The form and structure of it was what I was expecting, nice glass display, good response from touch, colors looked sharp and everyone was happy. We loaded Netflix, Disney Tsum Tsum, and another game TanTan. I thought everything was fine, until I saw her going back to one of our old cell phones to play this TanTan game. I asker her why, and she said that the game would 'glitch out' on her. I though no way, the tablet should have much better specs than my old Samsung Note 2. I tried it out, and there is a definite delay in most all her games. All her games with motion were sluggish, choppy and moved unpredictably. I thought maybe it was something that she installed without me knowing, so I did a factory reset, and install just one game, Tsum Tsum. Still the same choppy, sluggish mess. I was very disappointed. We own ton of Samsung cell phones and have never had really any issues like this. I am returning the Tab 4, 7\" and I don't care if they charge me a restocking fee... I have no use for a poorly made/designed product like that. I give it two stars because it streamed Netflix videos fine, and browsing looked sufficient. We ended up getting an Acer Iconia 8\" for the same price and it is leaps and bounds better. The games are smooth, video definition is higher and has a very cool aluminium shell. She is a happy camper now."}

HOWEVER, this device will not simply let you move files and apps over to the SD card. It completely defeated the reason to have an SD card. I can only transfer some data from some apps, but as far as any apps on the device, they MUST stay on the device. This made me dislike this tablet almost completely. I bought this tablet for simple use any way, so I'm not upset with the purchase.\n\nBuyer beware though, you CANNOT extend this tablet's storage space with an SD card."}

He's familiar with it already since I own the 10\" tablet myself...but I rarely let him use it. When I found the 7\" at this price point, I was willing to put some money with his gc so he could get it. It's identical to mine only smaller so it was super easy for him to use it.

Everything stays blurry no matter what setting it's on, unless the subject is close and not moving.  It's definitely one of the best tablets otherwise.  I noticed that her charger cable is significantly shorter (about half the length) than the charger cable my son got with his Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7 inch from the store.  Not sure why the need to downsize the charger.  The tablet has to sit on the floor to reach any outlets while charging."}

I purchcased this tablet for my 10 year old daughter six months ago, along with a harty case. It has been great!! I love that it has an micro sd slot. I put a 64 gb sd card in it. She can store full movies. The only limiting factor is that every app has a small amout stored on the internal storages so that can limit how many apps you can have. Despite this, we have been able to get most the apps we want. It is easy to have apps stored on the sd card to save room. Many other devices do not have this capability to add storage.  Resolution quality is great. I wish it had a flash.  I recommend this product."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This tablet is definitely useful as I just lost my smartphone and have to use an old one from years ago; but using it as my main smart device I've noticed a plethora of issues.\n\n-When plugged into an AUX cord the audio will distort if turned up too high. I don't mean distortion like usual when audio is played too loud through speakers, the audio is terribly broken. I can play music through the same speakers at a louder volume than this tablet can produce without issue.\n-The WiFi and Bluetooth will randomly disconnect (it still says I'm connected to an access point but I have no internet access. I have to disconnect and reconnect to fix the problem).\n-The front and back camera's are absolutely terrible. It looks like a Nokia from 2005 + no flash or autofocus.\n-The tablet will lag and freeze up from time to time. Switching from app to app is a hassle, even when its only two apps open.\n\nUnfortunately by the time I realized these problems the warranty had expired. So I have to focus on the good things about this tablet:\n\n-Battery Life: A single charge will last me all day even on heavy use. I can go two days on a charge if I use Power Saving Mode.\n-Perfect Size: The 7\" screen is the perfect balance between screen real-estate and mobility. I can fit it into my pocket with ease. People keep asking me if it's a phone with a surprised look on their face.\n-Water Resistance: It doesn't say it on the product page, but if a drop of water lands on the screen it stays a drop. If I move it around it doesn't leave a trail of water. Note: Not water PROOF.\n\nI think if mine didn't have the defects I listed at the top then I would definitely recommend this product. Although I can't say if these issues are exclusive to my tablet or if they all have these problems. If you think you want to try it out be sure to keep the warranty in mind."}

Purchasing a separate SD card doesn't help because Google doesnt allow you to transfer apps to the SD card - has to stay on internal memory. In fact, this is such an issue with the Galaxy Tab 4 that if you google \"Galaxy Tab 4 memory issue\" all kinds of help tickets will come up regarding how COMPLETELY USELESS this tablet is. I've had this tablet for a few days now and after you update the requisite Google apps, like Gmail, Drive, etc. you are left with 500MB or so for anything you might want to do with the tablet. Also discovered that when you have less than 400MB the tablet won't let you even download a small movie due to space constraints. Basically, you have the space for 1 thing non Samsung/Google at a time. If you want anything more than that you will have to uninstall the 1 thing you're currently using to make space for your new 1 thing. Ironically the memory booster app I installed took up more space than it was able to clean, because again, the ENTIRE tablet memory is consumed by Samsung pre-installed bloatware and the memory booster saw it as essential. I was very surprised by the high praise in Amazon reviews as a simple Google search turned up these problems, and they are fairly ubiquitous."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I received this as a gift from my parents. Usually when I receive a gift I won't be too harsh. I got this because my Nexus 7 broke recently before that. And for a tablet that you would buy last minute, it's pretty fair. But I use this everyday and there is so much that bugs me about this device. First let's talk about the memory on this device. It is advertised as an 8GB device. However, you are running Android and Lollipop side by side so that takes up 4 of the 8 gigabites. Then there are a bunch of pre-installed apps. Now we only have roughly 2-3 gigabites. While this is a fair amount, if you use your tablet for work like me, you'll find yourself downloading apps for work and school and you barely have room for anything else. The camera is crap but that doesn't bother me because I have a real camera to take photos with. The touch screen is very odd; it can either be really sensitive that if a crumb were to land on it, it wouldn't notice to it's so insensitive it wouldn't notice you jam your thumb through the screen. The touch screen is one of my main issues. Let's say you have an app where you have to hold down your finger to do something. I'll use Minecraft as an example. In Minecraft you hold your thumb on the screen to remove dirt. Often times however, the touch screen doesn't let you hold it down and you can only tap. This seems to be a thing that occurs very often and can be very frustrating.\n\nTouchWiz is a very annoying program. Since it is run side by side with Android you get holes in TouchWiz and all of a sudden Android appears. I'm not saying that Android is a bad thing, I actually prefer it over TouchWiz, but the consistency  is sooooo bad on TouchWiz. It has no idea what it wants to be. If everything was TouchWiz in this device I wouldn't be as mad. I just want consistency.\n\nThe back of this tablet is very smooth. This might sound like a pro, but it is actually a con. With no grip on the back, the tablet feels very slippery too hold, which could lead to a cracked screen. So you're going to have to spend another 15 dollars on a case if you want to keep this hunk of junk, Which is pretty common today."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This tablet has two good features: price and screen. Everything else sucks.\n\n1. Slow,slow,slow. Everything is jerky, even Candy Crush. Switching apps takes a lifetime. Opening up a new app even more. Keypress takes up to a second to be recognized.\n2. Samsung's Android flavor is just unbearable. All configuration options are thoughtfully arranged in the least logical fashion, and grouped in several inconvenient tabs that make little sense.\n3. Back button is on the right, not left as in vanilla Android devices (Google, Motorola). This might be a matter of preference but I find it not intuitive at all.\n4. Android 5 Lollipop? No way.\n5. No custom ROMs are available for this device (save for repackaged Samsung ROMs that essentially is the same thing less bloatware) due to Samsung's infinite wisdom in deciding to implement heavy-duty protection for this chipset.\n6. Bloatware. Then some more. And more.\n7. Did I mention its slow? It will often ask me for PIN code twice after booting, in immediate succession.\n\nDisclaimer: I am running the latest version as provided by mighty Samsung. There may have been miniscule performance improvements in last upgrades, but even if so it barely makes a dent."}

I put a black I rhino case on it and use a screen protector instead of any plastic cover. I put a 32 gig chip in it. I highly re comment that if you snag a lot of pics or vids.the only issue I have is all the boat ware and apps I can't move to the card without rooting it . Having the true clean master on it saves it by cleaning out all the junk and lettin me know before it locks up. All of the clean master products are wonderfull along with their security and battery app. That combo makes this a real winner for the money. I am a extreme user and group admin and I'm on thi thing day and night non stop.(disabled). I've watched complete baseball football and nascar races and the pic quality is great and no problems at all. Great battery life coupled wit C.M. Battery doctor. Good cord and awesome size and feel with the iRhino case on it. It has a kickstand on it so you can just set it down on the kickstand and let it go. Great tab and I'm real happy with it."}

Just using it for a week, there was a difference. Just opening snap chat, camera, and opening apps, the Galaxy was a bit slow.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "What can you say....It's an excellent tablet with a great reputation.  I use it for watching videos, email, and mild internet surfing.  It is a great bridge between using a smart phone and breaking out the laptop when you are sitting around the house.  Everything works as advertised; I can use it for days on a single battery charge (although I don't use it everyday); and the screen res is way better than what I need/use it for.  My only complaint would be that it could really use a better camera.  If you are the kind of person that carries a tablet everywhere, takes pictures, and blogs/journals about your experiences....then I might look elsewhere (unless you are cool with a camera that only works decently in perfect light conditions with minimal resolution). For the casual user though, this can't be beat.  The price is right; the quality is great; Samsung is reputable; and it just feels and looks good in your hands.  Make sure you pair it with a high quality screen protector right away. Like I said, for the money, the display is great so don't take any chances with it. Just for the sake of saying so...I have used this for about 3 months now and am extremely happy."}

Battery life is great it will last up to 3 days on a single charge. The only complaint I have is that it takes long to charge about 4 to 5 hours if not more for a full charge. And if you have a galaxy s5 phone you will notice that the picture quality is a lot better on the phones than on the tablet. Overall the tablet is great and I highly recomend it of you are looking for a premium tablet for a decent price."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "Have all the people giving this tablet 5 stars never owned an iPad?  This is a low budget, entry level, slow, slow, slow, tablet. I would say it's ok if you're on a budget, but if you have the cash, look elsewhere. For the price, I think it's fair (hence the 3 star rating), but man is it slow. So unresponsive. Every app launch, swipe, or press...there is a lag. We're an Apple family. We have iPhones, iPads, Macbook Pros, and Minis throughout the house (not that you care, but just so you know where I'm coming from). I thought I'd give Android a try just to see what the fuss was about. Bearing in mind this is a very low budget tablet, I had low expectations on it's performance, but wow, this really disappointed me. I mean, my daughter has an old iPad 2 circa 2011, and it is noticeably faster than this. This Tab 4 feels cheap in your hands, like a slab of plastic. I think the screen is made of champagne flute glass as it shattered the first time it was dropped from about 3 feet onto kitchen floor tile. If you're thinking this would be adequate for a child, I would say get a used iPad instead. You may have to pay a premium for Apple products, but they're built better, last longer, and don't come preloaded with Samsung bloatware. I realize this costs about half an iPad Mini and I would say the iPad Mini is twice as good.\n\nAgain, if you don't have the budget for an iPad or even Nexus tablet, this might be adequate, but keep your expectations low."}

This is my 3rd tablet, my first was a Kindle fire 7 inch, my second was an iPad 3Rd generation10 in. and now the Samsung Galaxy tab 4  7 in. Model. This 7 inch model fits perfectly around my hand and is lightweight compared to my heavier iPad.  The speed and performance for general web browsing is excellent, although I am not a heavy game player, so I could not review on the speed of those games.\n\nThe flaws, is that Depending on the site, you can not accurately scroll up and down, example Hotmail or other websites. Like the iPad,  you can not view flash videos, so when your on facebook, you can't see them or download flash player. Or play certain app.s like Dream Box mathematics App. This charges quickly but the battery seems to use up even when it's idle and not in use. The battery is not as efficient as the IPad.\n\nOverall, I'm not a tech specialist, but am overall pleased with the price of $139 for this speedy Samsung Tablet. It does the job for Web browsing, light APP usage, checking emails and Facebook. I love the overall feel, look and performance of my new tsblet, well worth the price even though it have minor flaws."}

I recently bought a Lenovo 7 inch tablet, which I was initially happy with.  That failed to work suddenly and Lenovo would not honour the guarantee.  My loss.\nMy wife swears by Samsung and so I took the plunge.  Nice tablet.  Easy to use with w very responsive screen.  Sure, the internal memory is not the biggest and much of the 'bloatware' cannot be moved to an inserted SD card.  BUT, most of the 'bloatware' can be disabled and this will aid faster performance.  Around 90% of the apps that I have downloaded CAN be moved to the inserted SD card, thus leaving plenty of space on the internal storage.  Around 4gb of the 8gb internal is used up but the remaining 4gb is more than adequate for me.\nSound is sufficient from the mono internal speaker but when earphones are used the sound is really quite good quality.  Camera is only 3mp but again this is sharp and more than adequate for 'snapping' and videos.  Nobody can realistically expect semi-pro shots from a tiny lens and sensor.  Having the front facing low res camera makes Skype easy too.\nI like this tablet."}

It's fast and it can fit in big pockets.  It is very functional.  I broke mine and am buying a new one because it's cheaper on Amazon to buy than get repaired.  I absolutely love the device.  I recommend an external SD card and don't load any app over 2 GB.  Also, disable (turn off and uninstall updates) for some of the TouchWiz bloat ware like Hancom Office, Samsung Galaxy AppStore, and the Samsung in app purchase.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This is my first mobile computing personal assitant device.  I was biased for the Samsung brand because they had made a great external CD drive.  I have an older Nokia phone which I love but don't use on-line, and it's not useful for apps because its operating system isn't one of the main ones.  I mainkly wanted a mobile device which can run an app which only works on Android, Apple (iOS) or Kindle.  I'm convinced that this is the best entry-level device --- that is, for someone like me who is accustomed to a desktop keybard and cell phone, and new to tablets and touch-screen.  The size is perfect for carrying around --- big enough to get some useful internet use, more than with a cell phone-size device, and small ehough for a purse, brief-case, man-bag, etc.  I am keeping mine inside a quart-size polyethelene food storage bag.  I made the fit a little tighter with some tape, so that this both protects it all around, including the screen, and is transparent so that I can use the tablet inside this cover --- it acts as a screen protector."}

Games, apps, even browsing is fast and smooth.  i also have a Samsung Galaxy 4 phone so using the tablet is just about identical, making it even easier to become accustomed to.  Love love love!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "The Tab 4 is more of a budget style tablet than some of the other Tablet offerings out there by Samsung and their competitors.  It all depends on what you would like to use it for to justify getting this tablet.  The overall tablet form is good and still runs on Android 4.4.4 kitkat.  It comes with your typical samsung/android fair of apps and settings, but these can all be adjusted to whatever design you wish to choose(which is why I prefer android devices).\n\nMy main reason for purchasing this tablet was for work purposes.  It's easier to use and organize notes and other aspects of daily work life.  In addition when I am home it has a nice enough screen to watch things such as netflix, and other viewing apps.\n\nI found no issues in the casual use of it.  However, there are only 2 things that I wasn't fond of.  The first is the screen is not gorilla glass so it's more prone to get scratches(I bought a screen protector to try and prevent this).  Another item I found, at least for my tastes, is that the speaker on the unit was not as powerful as I wished it to be.  Then again this could be the reason it's more price effective, and if you are only going to use headphones, then it would be perfectly fine.\n\nPROs:\n\nGreat Price\nScreen Size\nDecent Display\n\nCONs:\n\nSpeaker\nScreen Not Gorilla Glass\n\nAll in all, I didn't have any issues with the general use of the device, and it works well for what I intended.  Depending on what kind of use you want out of your tablet it could very well suit your needs.  The bright side of it not costing $500-$700 is you can be a little more carefree with it instead of having to take great care to prevent having anything happen to it."}

But it looks much better on the Tab 4. But to honest Samsung has made it harder for us to choose as the consumer which Standard tablet is better. I must say it was either this or the i pad mini. With a quad core processor I don't even know why I considered the ipad mini. I've always enjoyed Samsung Products. The only downside of this tablet is the speakers. They were badly placed.

But if you want to run apps make sure they are compatible with the Tab 4 7-inch, because it is NOT just a smaller version of the 8-inch or 10-inch Samsung tablets."}

I myself am rather tech savvy, so after reviewing the product on line, making a few comparisons, and of course the overall price, I was fairly confident this was a quality tablet. I cannot say that I or my fianc are disappointed by this item. Beautiful screen, responsive and fast processor. Haven't had a chance to check out everything but from what I can see, this is a definite steal for anyone looking to either join the tablet world, or upgrade an existing one at a fair price.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I bought this because it was a bargain at $139.99.  Amazon had 8 inch version at the time for $247.99.  I could not justify this price difference.  After receiving item, the price of 8 inch version dropped to $189.99 (white)  I think this tablet is too small for my taste.  When using the remote application, the text describing television shows is very small. The tablet is responsive, smooth and quite nice looking.  So the battle went on because I will lose 15 percent of cost due to it being a used computer product but I no longer cared.  I always was going to wish I went with 8 inch version.  That one is due here Wednesday.  Based on everything I tried - I know I will be pleased.  Remember too that the 8 inch version has double the capacity.  In the end, its a matter of taste.  The seven inch size for me is not enough.  I need the best balance for usability and portability.  In the end, because of my mistake, I will be paying an extra 21 bucks for the new larger version.  But at a total of $210.99, it could have been worse.  I cannot wait until it arrives.  In the meantime I am sending back this one tomorrow."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "The screen is bright and the colors are vivid. I am able to use a 64 GB sd micro card with no trouble even though this tablet is only supposed to use up to 32 GB. You get about 4.7 GB of internal storage, but between phone and internal storage, you really get 8+ GB for applications. I am able to move applications to internal storage to use the internal storage too, something that I couldn't do with newer versions of cyanogenmode on my old tablet. I am able to remote-control it from my computer using Team Viewer. There could be more memory. Even though 1.29 GB looks like a lot, the OS, built-in applications and installed applications use it up. If I really scrub the memory, I can free up about 500 - 700 MB of the memory, but it quickly goes down from there. The bluetooth audio works great until it loses its connection after the tablet has been asleep for a while. The pairing is still there, but it has to be reconnected. The best cover I have found is the Barnes and Noble cover for their Samsung Nook, which is the same device, just with a custom, simpler interface. I like this Samsung's interface well enough that I don't want to root it. It has plenty of functionality, though it doesn't have the sheer number of setting found in cyanogenmod. I am not quite proficient with closing the split screen, but it is nice when you want to look at two applications at once. The default keyboard is sized for a phone, not a tablet, so it is quite small. The wireless-N connectivity is pretty fast, but it won't necessarily use the full amount of throughput that you get from your internet connection. I have 200 Mbps downstream and my tablet reaches over 60 mbps. I know that devices hooked up to wireless like my laptop can go at the full speed, but the tablet's speed is quite respectable. The camera is not the best quality, but I have heard that the default android camera software is old and not the best, so it might not be the hardware. I read that a lot of android phones have very good cameras but the software keeps the camera from its full potential."}

The tablet was working fine and charging correctly at night, in the morning it would not turn on or charge. I took two pictures of the charging port showing there was no physical damage prior to shipping it to the repair center, as I was expecting to be brushed off citing physical damage, as is common with consumer electronics. Willy insisted that there was no way their service center could have damaged the unit and stated that it was \"obviously my fault\".  I was treated extremely poorly and I still do not have my tablet back, however the service center will fix it for a fee.  When I asked to speak to someone else, I was told \"there was no one else to speak with\" which I find hard to believe that Willy is solely handling all of the Samsung inbound calls on his own. Buyer beware: Samsung does not honor their warranties and cites physical damage as a reason."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This little tablet is great, if you know what you're getting. The driving factor that lead me to getting this device was Web browsing. I wanted something bigger than my phone (LG Optimus G Pro), and something more convient for times when I don't want to break out my MacBook Pro. I debated, and almost bought 8 inch version, I'm glad didn't. This is just the perfect size for me. I can browse online and comfortably view any website in landscape mode, while a quick flip to  portrait mode makes typing a breeze. I downloaded Big Hero 6 from the play store to check out the video quality and was impressed, but not overwhelmed. Granted I did buy the SD version, opting to save a few bucks over the HD version which would certainly look better. The speaker is \"okay\" but certainly gets the job done. I recommend headphones when your outside the confindments of a quiet room. Besides the guy sitting five away at Starbucks probably isn't interested in hearing the YouTube video you're watching. What I find to be the most impressive aspect of this device is the battery life. I've run the device for two days on a single charge with moderate+ use. This includes updating software,  downloading apps, browsing, watching downloaded videos, and streaming YouTube. I almost passed on this device to go for something with better specs. I'm glad I didn't however, as this does what I want on budget friendly slate. I would have given five stars instead of four if not for bloatware (which I understand comes with every device, even iOS devices). There's just two many Samsung apps that I'll never use or be able to get rid of. Thankfully this device has expandable storage to make up for the space the usless apps take up."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "1. Speed of switching between applications, browsing, etc.\n\nThis tablet is not very fast.  I have a Note 3 that runs laps around this thing.  I have never owned a tablet before (well I had a Nabi 2 for my daughter before this) and I guess I thought that the Tab 4 would run as well as my Note 3.  I, admittedly, was a bit uneducated on it all and I assumed that although my phone runs at a ~2.3 ghz processing speed (quad core) that this tablet's ~1.2GHz (quad core) would run similar since it has less to run (i.e., no PHONE parts - no need for a SIM card or that software, idk.  I guess I shouldn't assume I know anything about technology lol).  This tablet is sluggish.  But really I bought it for my 4 year old, so it is okay for what it is used for.  But I will not be using it in any of my college classes and I do my internet shopping on my Note 3, because everything is faster.\n\n2.  \"KIDS MODE\"\n\nIf you bought this for the \"Kids Mode,\" the first thing you might notice is that Kids mode does not come installed.  It is confusing, because if you look in your list of \"all applications\" (under settings), you can see the application there (with a dinosaur icon).  However no icon on any of the home screens on the tablet itself or under installed applications.  I did a hard reset and still it did not pop up, as I read online that some people were able to do a hard reset and the app icon popped up after that.  This did not work.  After some more goofing around and internet research I realized that you have to go under the \"widgets tab\" in the app drawer, and scroll through the list of widgets and it is there (although if you don't update the software first, it might not even be in widgets yet).  When you long press the widget to get it to the desktop it just looks like an icon.  It does not look like you would expect a widget to.  From there you load it.\n\nI like the \"kids mode\" app itself, except you can only have a LIMITED number of apps.  I was hoping to just load every single app my kid has ever liked to play in there for her but I had to pick and choose.  Also, if your kid button smashes and hits the power button, they can get out of kids mode accidentally.  This is problematic because of what I will mention in 3.\n\n3.  Multiple User Profiles\n\nThis software allowing multiple user profiles is kind of neat.  However, there are some annoying things about it.  For example, you can ONLY run \"kids mode\" from the \"owner\" user profile.  Because of this, if your kid does what I mentioned in 2. above and gets out of kids mode accidentally (normally when you hit \"exit\" properly, the parent has to enter a 4 digit pin to actually exit), they end up in your profile and can navigate wherever they want to.\n\nOther annoying things about the way multiple user profiles work:\n\n- You can't lock someone out of the Google bloatware, such as the google search bar, etc.\n\n- You can't share pictures from one user to another in the gallery.  Samsung tech tells me this is a \"security risk\" for the owner of the tablet.  SO, if you are going to use this table for a \"RESTRICTED user\" (i.e., an older child who would not want to use \"kids mode\"), and you want to set a wallpaper/lockscreen to a picture, you have to install some sort of photo sharing app (like This Life by Shutterfly, or I think you can download Dropbox), load the picture to the app, and then pull it from there into the restricted profile.  But you have to load the app of course from the \"owner\" profile (which is kid of tedious), then uninstall it if you don't want your kid messing around in dropbox anymore.  Unless you run a launcher (like Nova) and hide the app from within their profile, but that is getting pretty complicated, and it is suggested that the tablet's native Touchwiz launcher works best if you're using multiple user profiles.\n\n- You cannot run Kids Mode from within a restricted profile.  This is what I was hoping to do with the tablet.  Have my daughter's own icon that she could click on, then she'd launch her user and select the only icon I would have available for her - \"Kids mode\" (until she gets a little older anyway). Samsung tech support tells me that there is no workaround for this because it would be a security risk to allow multiple users to run the app.  I'm not sure how that is a security risk if you just allow the app to run off a shortcut of the icon in the \"owner\" profile, which you need a password to make any changes to anyway.  It seems like they could make it so that you can launch a shortcut of the app in a restricted profile or make it so that you can only make changes from the user profile to the kids mode app itself.  I'm sure that would not be that hard of a software tweak to make, but it is a \"security risk.\"\n\n4.  Asthetics\n\n-  You cannot change the color of the menus that I have been able to figure out.  This is nitpicky, but the blasting orange/blue on white background is pretty ugly to look at.  On my Note 3 I can change the background to black.  IDK why you don't have this option on the tablet.  I assumed little things like this would be fluid from device to device, which is why I blindly chose a Samsung tablet to purchase for my daughter.\n\n-  It feels a little more like using an Apple device with the limited amount of options they provide you with in the settings wheel.  Also, you cannot choose to view all the settings options in a list, you have to use their swipe \"tab\" system.  I don't really find these easier to use and I think it slows down the tablet swiping from tab to tab.  There is a 2 second delay before the tablet fully loads the next setting tab, which is very annoying.  I have reset the tablet twice hoping that somehow this would run smoother, but I have not had any luck.\n\n-  You cannot resize the widgets to a size of your choice in the Touchwiz launcher.  If you use the galaxy apps widget or the weather widget which are automatically available in the widget tab within the app drawer, it takes up like half the screen!\n\n5.  Other things to mention...\n\n- Developer options are accessed by hitting the device serial # 6 or 7 times.  This is just more of an FYI for anyone who wants to know.\n\n-  This tablet doesn't sense my 68 year old mother's fingers!  For some reason her hands can register my Note 3's touchscreen, but not the Tab 4's.  You might want to take that into consideration if you're buying this for someone old with poor circulation.\n\nOverall, this tablet is decent for someone with more patience than me.  I think it is slow and would just pay more for a faster tablet next time.  It is no fun to shop on and if you are running apps that load a lot of info (like amazon store), the app crashes.  I had a Nabi 2 previously for my daughter which had a 1.3 GHz processor that seemed WAY faster.  I also liked the way the kids mode worked much better on the nabi and the way the parent/kid modes split.  You could also automatically launch the nabi in kids mode OR parent's mode, which, to my knowledge, you cannot set the Tab 4 to automatically load into the restricted user profile (which would be dumb anyway I guess since you can't have your kid use the Kids Mode in their own profile - which still makes no sense to me).  This tablet comes with almost no bloatware, which is nice.  If I could go back again, I'd get a more expensive tablet with a faster processor I guess (although the Nabi 2 runs at about the same so I'm not sure why the Tab 4 is so slow)."}

It comes with a small paper instruction book, which is unusual these days, and it's especially helpful for those without constant wireless access. I'm having a hard time getting books in and getting them to run with text-to-speech, which is why I haven't given it 5 stars. Apparently the Kindle app doesn't allow TTS, and I haven't managed to get the Google books to play with Samsung's TTS very well. There are *2* TTS engines available in this unit, and it can play a sample of each so that a user can pick a preference. Another negative is that the 2 non-tactual touch buttons on the front of the unit are positively evil to find in the dark, so definitely not a 5-star unit."}

The tablet is much brighter than my Tab 3 and the swiping actions are improved.  Great battery life and plenty fast. I think the sound seems better as well.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "My husband gave me the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0\" for Christmas.  He purchased it at Best Buy and it came bundled with a very nice Belkin case (in black) and a 16GB SD card.  Not having very good WiFi access, I have mainly been using this as an e-reader, using the Kindle App.  I have a Kindle Touch, which I love, but our temporary living quarters does not have very good lighting, making it difficult to read my Kindle in the evening or at bedtime.\n\nCompared to the Kindle Touch, the Tab 4 is close in size.  The Tab is longer and the Touch is wider.  Weight-wise they are close with the Tab (maybe) being slightly heavier.  The screen on the Tab is larger, which for me, is not necessarily a plus.  The Touch has the nice edges around the screen, which make it easier and more comfortable to hold in one hand while reading.  The Belkin case helps a little but I have purchased an additional case that came with a wireless keyboard that offers a good place to grip while reading.  The downside is that it adds weight.\n\nAs far as reading in the Kindle App, I'm very pleased.  Of course it does not come nearly as close as the Touch does to reading from the pages of an actual book but it's not as bad as I thought it would be.  It offers options to change the background and text colors.  I find that reading with a black background and white text is easier on the eyes in dim lighting.  The page turning is basically the same.  I actually prefer the Kindle store on my Tab or my phone (Galaxy S4) to the Kindle itself because they show book prices in the list view.  If I'm shopping from my Kindle, I have to go into the book's detailed page to view the price.\n\nAs for the other applications on this device, I haven't had much change to try them.  I am typing this review and have written several others using the Tab with the wireless keyboard, which I purchased here on Amazon (NEWSTYLE Removable Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard and Protective Case).  This makes reviewing much easier, since my regular computer is in storage.  When I have better WiFi access I will be excited to try other apps and games.  This seems to be a great little device.  The e-reading capabilities alone are worth the price."}

He went to Walmart and purchased a new SD card. He then tried to move some games to the SD card and got an error saying \"Unable to move to SD card\". So we called Samsung support the 2nd day of using this NEW tablet and they did all the troubleshooting they could. They couldn't figure out what the issue was and blamed it on the SD card EVEN THOUGH they had already tested to see if other files/photos could be moved to the SD, which they COULD. So basically Samsung tech support was USELESS and in denial that it was an issue with the actual tablet. So yeah, returning it to Amazon. Looking at iPad minis now.\n\nUpdate:\n\nAfter setting up a return, we decided to try the tablet one last time with a different SD card. We WERE able to move some games to THAT SD card, so we switched the SD card again to the first one that we had issues with and we WERE able to move some games into it. It turns out the problem was with certain games. They DID have an option to be moved, yet they did NOT move. We decided to keep the tablet and delete the bad unmovable games instead. I still do wish that Samsung would have caught this, but obviously the tech support needs more training.\n\nIf you do end up purchasing this tablet, just be aware that your favorite games may NOT be able to be moved to the SD card even if they have the option that says MOVE TO SD CARD. This becomes a problem because it will fill up the internal memory fast and cause other issues."}

Firefox has A LOT  of trouble keeping any memory available. Various cleaner apps like cw cleaner indicate heating and boosting issues. Every five minutes it uses 500mb of ram that need to be flushed before you can get proper usage out of it. Purchased at Costco for 159 and thankfully they will return it with no questions. Samsung cust care is almost non existent.\nThe keyboard frequently misses inputs and the o and p swap places often. Samsung forums are filled with these issues and the predictive typing is a joke.\nLastly, the wifi issue.  It will constantly lose and rescan the network, even when it shows as connected. The only work around is a temp one, manually adding your network by ssid, then passcode every week Gets very tiring.  Memory hog!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "Overall I like this tablet, but I've had a few issues and am exchanging it for another one to give it one more chance.\n\n1) At first the battery life was low, so I had to write to Samsung and they replied with a lengthy email with a lot of links...in the end that seemed to work.\n\n2) When I first fired it up, wifi/internet was very laggy and I was disappointed.  I put it down for the night and when I started it the next morning it downloaded the next version of KitKat OS.  That seemed to help.  Then later in the day it downloaded yet another version,4.4.2.  Weird that it didn't just come with 4.4.2, unless I got a used one (???).\n\n3)  Wifi is weak even one room away.  Ipod touch 4G and Ipad mini are better than this in the sames rooms at the same times. Sometimes wifi stops and I have to turn it off and back on again which seems to fix it.\n\n4) My latest issue is that when I plug the tablet into a home or car stereo, the sound is very low, even with stereo and tablet volume all the way up.  When you do set the tablet volume up, the sound becomes very scratchy like a distant AM radio station.  I looked for internet answers, bought a new cable, tested my Ipod touch on both stereos (which worked fine, with both cables), did a hard factory reset,  and spent 1/2 hour on chat with Samsung.  The chat assistant said it was a tablet/stereo incompatibility.  Highly unlikely since every other tablet/Ipod/Ipad I've run through these systems sounds fine.  Then she said it was bad speakers...again, the radio/mp3/other device sound is fine. At least she tried. She asked if I tried different apps...I had...games, mp3, Google player, etc...all had the issue.  (By the way the headphones work fine at all volumes, as does the bluetooth link for sound to an external speaker).\n\nI am now exchanging it.  If the next one does the same thing, I'll give it a 1 star and get a refund.  If not, I'd give it a 4 star.  It is not super speedy, but I'm not a power user...mostly mp3's, email and internet browsing.  I do wish I could get a 16MB version as the OS uses about 3.5 MB.  Definitely get a 32GB SD card...unfortunately not all apps can be placed on the SD card.\n_________________\nupdated review 3/5/15:  I received a replacement  unit  promptly and the same sound issue is resolved with this new one.  I would give it a 5 star rating  if the wifi reception was a little  stronger and Samsung would provide latest Android version.  Overall a good unit."}

However, be warned...the very little 8GB storage it comes with is a pain in the butt, I had to return it within a day.  I was left with about 4.5GB due to Android's OS after first boot.  Then, after all my apps synced from my Google account, I only had about 1.2 GB left.  NO room to get some music in, NO room to download a movie or two (I travel a lot, so this tablet's main purpose was going to be email, and movies).  I recommend spending a few dollars more on the 8 inch version, which has 16GB out the box.  OR, you can spend a bit more on the Pro series (which I did, waiting in the mail for it).  Can't really say I recommend this.  Even though you can load an SD card to expand storage (up to 32GB, bummer), the main problem is that some apps aren't able to be stored into the SD card and only uses system storage. And when it's close to full, it runs SLOWWWWW.  I had to return it, wasn't for me."}

This was a present for my 10 year old and it's been really great. We all have Samsung S4 phones and I've been super happy with my Samsung phones the past few years and I also have the Samsung Note tablet 8.0 with the little pen. While my girl does wish the tab had a pen like mine, she actually prefers the smaller shape of the Tab and all in all she's been thrilled (she's had it a few months now...). We've had absolutely no problems with it and unlike the Fire tablet you can access anything you want online including all the google apps you've previously bought through google play (Amazon Fire doesn't let you access the Google Play store in any way shape or form - you'd have to root the device to do it, thus voiding your warrantee). All the Samsung phones and tablets have a super easy to use and navigate interface. It's easily customizable with many available options for static or dynamic wall papers (my favorite is an aquarium that I have on both my tablet and phone) and tons of apps through google play. You can also download the Amazon apps for Android as well, but I've yet to see any on the Amazon store that I can't find on play and I like having all my apps on Google Play so that they're automatically migrated to any new Android product I buy (such as when you upgrade your phone or tablet, or add a new Android device).\n\nI highly recommend this product for kids, teens and any adults looking for a better alternative than the cultish Apple Ipad (I'm sure I'll take some heat for that comment...). It's a great tablet, a great size and well worth the price."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This was a gift, and this critique is made by Bobbi Haugen.\n\nThe tablet has a good-sized screen. It is ultra-sensitive to touch and the screen goes off unexpectedly. It would be more user friendly if a vertical and horizontal UP and DOWN were defined clearly so as to prevent turning it around and around.... and it would be more user friendly if the GO-BACK were better defined and made to be felt apart from the rest of the tablet. Otherwise it's working fine. I have to say though, that due to these shortcomings, and not knowing if one is available, I would recommend to another to try and find a tablet without these issues."}

WOW.....this Samsung....what a great tablet. This wonderful thing makes hubby happy. He no longer has to sit and wait long frustrating minutes for downloads, he can surf with ease and I don't hear those long, drawn out SIGHS anymore. He uses it all the time and so far has had no complaints. I have the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 so I am actually a little bit jealous that he has the later model. :)  We are very, very pleased with our Samsung Galaxy tablets and would highly recommend them to anyone!

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "My short review: this is a great tablet for personal use, with one MAJOR disappointment and that is AMAZON PRIME INSTANT VIDEO DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS OR OTHER SAMSUNG TABLETS.\n\nMy long review: I've been an Android user for a long time but this is my first Samsung device. I purchased this mostly for my personal use (internet, email, pictures, books magazines, games, light watching, etc.) this is a great tablet and I recommend it for these uses. BUT, I am a parent of preschool/elementary school age kids and I also wanted to be able to access my purchased Amazon library content on it. However, this and apparently other Samsung Tables are not supported by Amazon Prime Instant Video which is a very BIG disappointment and if I was aware of this before I would not have purchased this tablet. I did consider returning it but as I said it works great for my personal use so I will keep it and instead next time I want to buy a movie I'll probably buy on Google Play.\n\nMy rant: I have done a lot of research on the web and there are supposedly ways to stream prime videos but I have not been able to get either to work. I did download the Prime app (which was not trivial) but it only directs me to the website which sends me the Amazon app which directs me to the Prime app which sends me to the website again, ... you get the picture. Needless to say, the same app works seamlessly on my HTC phone. There is also an \"un-official way\" which is a pain to set up (download a separate browser and flash player, change bunch of settings on your device as well as your prime settings, which could mess up your other devices) and even then, you still cannot download your movies to play off-line.\n\nI cannot be sure of this but I believe that this is not necessarily a technology issue but a marketing issue. So AMAZON AND SAMSUNG PLEASE TAKE NOTE because I and 95% of other parents of young children who I know (or who I don't know but have observed in public places) would like to be able to play movies/TV shows for our kids outside of home where there is no wifi. Example: in a restaurant, on a plane, on a road trip, in a hotel room, etc. which means the content need to be ON THE DEVICE AND NOT STREAMING so Netflix and hulu and Amazon Prime on this device are useless."}

Then came Action Launcher 3 telling me there isn't enough space for wallpaper. Mind you I have inserted a Micro SD card to increase capacity. This fixed the problem and I was a happy camper. Battery life is much better than my Epic 4G touch. I was quite hesitant on whether to buy the Apple iPad or the Galaxy Tab.

I purchased a refurbished model sold here by Ocean Reef Electronics and couldn't be more satisfied with the purchase. I've seriously switched from my iPhone to this tablet. It fits easily into any of my jeans pockets (I wear size 33-32). It's so much easier to use than my iPhone was it's unbelievable. I have fairly large hands, and using this size of device is just so much easier. Couple that with the multi-tasking capabilities and keyboard shortcuts and I've been more \"productive\" and with less \"effort\" than with the iphone just had to tailor a few settings to the way I interact with the device (which it seemed like I was constantly doing on the iphone and never being wholly satisfied with it). \"Tablet-sized\" devices may not be for everyone but for me it just works. This is my first amazon review and I felt compelled to share such a positive experience with a device. I plan to get rid of my iPhone completely and replace it with the most basic talk/text phone to maintain a phone number and mobile text capability, and use Ting(keep reading) for service. I estimate I can shrink my phone bill down to less than $20/month (from the $35ish I was averaging with the iPhone and ting). Check out ting dot com and compare your own bill/usage and see for yourself. Also I applied a Mr. Shield anti-glare screen protector. I highly recommend to my friends and family an anti-glare screen protector for any device."}

Then after only using it a few times, it started to freeze and the screen had flashing horizontal white bars across it. I spent over 2 hours on their online FAQ section and service area. I performed every restart and reset possible, and it still locks up after only a few minutes of being turned on.\n\nNow, I am sure it is just a defective device, which is fine, it happens. But what I cannot understand is why the person at the other end of the phone in their customer service department almost refused to do anything except tell me to reset the machine or to take it somewhere where a technician can reset it for me... really? I have been using electronics for my entire life, I think I know how to follow a few directions on resetting a device. I was one of those people in the eighties who could set the clock on their VCR properly, so it is a little insulting that they assumed I was completely clueless.\n\nTheir products may be fine, but based on the service alone, I will never buy another product of theirs.\n\nI hope this helps others to make a more informed choice when looking for a device. Don't just look at the cost, look at the service. That is why I normally spend a few dollars more on higher-quality products backed up by more responsible parent companies."}

I appreciate the fact that additional memory can be added, in the form of a micro-SD card.  The screen resolution is outstanding!  One of my kids dropped their tablet and cracked the screen.  I researched replacing the screen myself...found some great instructional videos on YouTube, and found the replacement screen and tools right here on Amazon.  It took about 30 minutes and it's good as new!  The Tab 4 is much faster than the Tab 3, which means there will likely be another Tab 4 in my future.  Highly recommended!"}

I would rather be able to be able to see the separate folders inside the device / sd card instead of just seeing what files were added when.\nThe device doesn't hold much data and even with expandable micro sd card, it is very small.  I would expect to see these tablets start being able to hold 100+ GB of data in the near future for a similar price.  For my use, these won't be replacing my laptops any time soon.\nI am used to watching video on my laptop and I have noticed that the video quality isn't as good on the tablet."}

Decided to surprise her with this tablet and she is very happy. Purchased a case for it which protects it, but she is still able to place it in her purse. Debated about the size but it appears I made the right decision as she is able to take it with her, and so many places have wifi available. I have commented to her, I am thinking of dropping my smartphone and getting a small tablet myself. Phone data charges are absurd, so a more reasonable approach would be a small tablet for app use, but w feature phone for use on the go for phone calls and some extras. A way to beat these cell phone companies who are charging too much for their services. So I would recommend this tablet to others."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I just received my tablet a few days ago and I love it. A lot of people write reviews with specs and comparisons, I just tell you what I like, which is a bit of a comparison to Amazon's own Kindle Fire (2nd Gen.) A while ago I bought an S3 phone and to this day it remains the best phone I have ever owned. That phone made me a Samsung Customer for life. When it came time for me to upgrade my Kindle Fire I almost bought an HDX but at the last moment, I opted for the Galaxy Tab for one simple reason... Google Play. As much as I loved my Fire, the clunky keyboard and inability to get a lot of the apps I love was what ultimately steered me toward the Galaxy Tab and I have not been disappointed. I love the user- friendly interface and I especially love how similar it is to my phone. I haven't yet found an app I wanted that I could not get. As soon as I fired it up and logged into my account it automatically installed everything for me very quickly. All I had to do was remove 2 or 3 apps that were specific to my phone and one that requires the use of a flash or exterior light. The battery has a great lifespan and the charger has a nice, long cord. The screen is beautiful, vibrant, and very responsive. The galaxy tab is also much lighter than my old Kindle Fire making it much easier for me to read into the wee hours of the morning. I will stop short of considering the Galaxy Tab a superior device, after all I am comparing a brand new device to one that I purchased a few years ago, perhaps I would feel different if I were comparing my Galaxy tab to a brand new HDX. So far Amazon's customer service has been TOP NOTCH with my Kindle Fire (actually I have two,) and I think Samsung would be hard pressed to beat them. In the end, as I said before..Google Play and a true android operating system is what won me over.\nIf you have a Galaxy phone you're in love with and looking to compliment it with a tablet, you cannot go wrong with a Galaxy Tab.\nCONS:  My only complaints are the weak camera, lack of flash or exterior light, and smaller 8g size. That said, I'm sure I could have spent more and got a flash, better camera, and 16 or 32 g or memory...but I'm not made of money. Compared to what I paid for my S3 phone, this was a steal anyway. In the end, those few items are not worthy of dropping a star, especially when I could get those options if I wanted to pay for a more advanced device. I didn't pay for a better camera, flash, or 16 g, so there is no reason to use those points to justify lowering my review.\nAgain, my Galaxy Tab is brand spanking new so I will come back and update if anything changes."}

Fed Ex Failed to locate NY after leaving Maryland. and after 13 days gave up and gave the package to the USPS, who got it to me in one day. The tablet was safe, and works well. My daughter loves it. The screen touch sensitivity is good, and the games I have tried on it LOOK great on the screen. We also got a protective case for it that shipped separately and a memory card. I do not like that the downloads go to the tablet and not the card. This does not look like it can be changed, but was a simple matter to go and move the lesser memory games to the card. Games over about 50 MB will not move over. Well, I guess that is an improvement for the next model! Thanks for a fun tablet that did not break the bank to get and works well!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "A product review isn't what I wanted to write. I just can't find a way to communicate about my purchase without possibly leaving inappropriate negative feedback. I like my unit, but it only came with 8 GB memory, when I know I had selected a more expensive unit to get more memory. Unfortunately the electronic documentation doesn't mention the 16 GB I had settled for, nor does it show the 32 GB I had actually wanted. My unit is now full, wants me to delete files, and won't let me install new apps. I have moved the old apps to a temporary 16 GB module from my old tablet, and there is a significant amount of free space now, but the unit still says it is full. I don't know what to do. I don't believe this is a product flaw. I think the product is superior to most. I just need to find out where to get help, first to get my unit working, and secondarily to upgrade the memory. 8 GB does not seem like a reasonable amount of memory for a tablet."}

Most of the other reviews tell the story but I can add this: I use it to assist in my photography hobby among other things. The display is absolutely beautiful when it come to displaying photographs, playing movies, or watching TV. Everything on the screen can be customized to meet your needs, including Font size for the old guys like me that don't like to carry their reading glasses. The 8 GB of internal memory will hold all the Apps that I need and, YES YES it will indeed use a 64 gb card instead of the 32 gb card as stated. The 64gb card gives more than ample space for pictures, books, and movies, and if that is not enough they give you a 50gb upgrade to your Dropbox account. I found it on here for $ 139 and that is a steal for an entry level tablet like this one. PS. Battery life is excellent.\n  Note:  As a photographer I had only one disappointment with this tablet. There is an App on the market called DSLR controller. but for some reason it works with all the Samsung Tablets except the 7 inch models. Other than that, it is fantastic."}

I haven't added her music to it, but she most loves the note taking and calendar.  It is the Wi-Fi only version, so it doesn't work everywhere.\n\nWe are shifting from Outlook Calendar to Google Calendar because it works on our phones and computers, and her tablet.  I really like Outlook's popup with sound, and I wish I had some simple way to configure Google Calendar to do the same.  That Lady loves being able to see her appointments on her phone when finding a time for another.  Conflicts realized later make her unhappy, and when momma ain't happy...\n\nIt's cool and it's Android, and that screen is awesome!  The fact that she can control the TV and TIVO with it is a bonus! That's what I got it for, and I was surprised she hasn't even tried it yet.\n\nAs a geek, I like Android architecture.  One of these days I'll write some Android apps and want them to work on this tablet and our phones.  There are lots of apps, which is good. I don't do crApple.  They are built for those with much more money than good sense, so very glad to support more reasonable economic models.\n\nThe cams are ok, but there is no such thing as a decent camera in a tab or phone.  Get a real camera with a 50x zoom if you want to take decent pictures.  For web conferencing / video phoning, this will work ok.\n\nUPDATE: 1/25: I tried to use this outside today, and the display is not bright enough to use, even in the shade.  Other than that I like it fine.  I got it so my wife could use it with TV/Tivo.  To my surprise, she hasn't done that AT ALL.  Newp, she loves it for entering stuff into Google Calendar.  We're ditching Outlook Calendar for a web calendar.  The G-cal notifications are sucky, but maybe will get better. Maybe.  I also raised a weather station, and web-enabled that, so using an App to access that.  Pretty cool.  Liking the idea of the tablet better each time I goof with it.  WebCam is next?

It was confusing, didn't work like my other tablet running the exact same flavor of Android (which was also a Samsung) and seemed underpowered.\n\nNow that I given the tablet the benefit of the doubt and worked with it for a while...I really like it.  a lot!  The screen is really bright..sometimes too bright.  The processor is not going to make your hair fly back, but I will be lying if I didn't say that it was my own fault for over-loading the memory with multiple apps...that is just the nature of the Android OS right now...only certain apps have permission to put information on the handy external SD card.  So, the internal memory gets full and then slows down the whole thing.\nIt is a great size for games and reading...but my favorite thing is to have it as my work tablet...I usually carry pages and pages of documents and schedules which all fall out of the binder or the post-it notes fall off the sheets.\nWith my Tab 4, I upload everything to my Box or Evernote account and have everything with me.  If I have to copy notes quickly or duplicate something, I snap a picture and let one of the apps make it searchable.\nI will admit that it has taken me a while to get tablets involved in my work life, but this little guy made it very easy."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "If you're looking to buy yourself a cool new toy without breaking the bank, look no further than the Galaxy Tab 4. I have been a long time apple user, and as a matter of fact still have my 1st generation iPhone! I as well have the MacBook pro and the 2nd Gen Ipad mini. So yah I guess you could say I was the poster child of apple. Well, a few weeks ago a family member got me this tablet not knowing that I already had an iPad(It didn't help that I didn't use it much). I happily took it due to the fact they also got me a data plan for it as well! I have never really been able to get into tablets really. For me a phone and a laptop was all I needed.  However, this little guy changed all of that! First off, this is the first time I've used an android device in about 3 years and FINALLY it feels like they have caught up, if not surpassed apple in their software. Yes, of course it feels I bit weird using Android, but I'm learning to love it! Converting over makes you feel like you've broken out of the usual, and gives a feeling of awesomeness customizing every aspect of your experience on this tablet! My friends, if you've been wanting to get your first tablet,  but are a little nervous, or don't know how to \"Take the leap\" THIS IS THE TABLET FOR YOU! I mean at only a 150$ you really don't have much to lose! Now I will say there are a few things this tablet does lack, however none of it shocks you for how much you have paid for it! First off, you're gonna wanna grab a micro SD card right off the bat. 8 gigs isn't a whole lot and really SD cards are so cheap now a days, it makes you wonder why apple charges you 100$ for 16 gigs more storage? Also, don't plan to make this your go to camera,  while the pictures get the point across, 3 mega pixels isn't enough for this to be your every day shooter. All in all you really feal like you're getting your money's worth with this tablet. It doesn't feel like a high end tablet, but at the same time it does everything you want it to do at a very reasonable price, all while still feeling study to hold, and useful for everything! Plus, if you are like me and didn't know how to break into the wonderful world of android with all its feature, customisation, and \"freedom\", this is a great way to give it a try and see what you've been missing out on! Or if you're just looking to break into the new and big world of tablets, there's no better place to start than here!\n\nP.s. ever since they announced the iPhone 6 I couldn't wait to get it, but thanks to this tablet I think I'll be switching over to a new Galaxy phone instead!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "For $158 (at the time I purchased this), this is a great 7\" tablet.  It's not too light, not too heavy, and has a good, solid feel.  Everything I've run on it so far has run really smooth and haven't had any issues thus far.\n\nPros:\n- Fits in my pant's pocket if I need it to\n- Micro SD slot\n- Has a lot of the common things in most tablets: camera, WiFi, bluetooth, GPS, etc\n- Speaker is loud\n- Backing feels really good, not slippery\n- Android and apps run great and very smooth\n\nCons:\n- Camera could have been better, 3 MP on the rear is a bit lower than what I'd expect out of Samsung.  6-8 MP would have been nice.  Fortunately I don't plan on taking too many pictures with this.\n- No camera flash\n- Rear facing speaker.  Also when watching a video and using the rear speaker for audio, sometimes you can really hear the audio better in 1 ear than the other.\n- No light sensor = no auto brightness option\n- Only 8 gigabytes built in storage\n\nTo me, all of those cons are only worth the 1 star loss.  This really is a great tablet and I am very satisfied with my purchase."}

A side note as well I was hesitant to purchase the 7-inch version thinking it would be such a small tablet but in person it's actually a great size especially to take around with you at all times.

Also, they can download free apps without having to sign up through the i-store and give a credit card number even for a free app.  They frequently pull out their tablets to look up something on the internet; they also play games on them, and one has a snapchat account (no smart phone for someone who can't pay for it).  My daughter has been using hers to look up medications and similar things, and is quite pleased with its ease of use.  I'm no tablet expert, and so can't speak to the technical aspects of it.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "Pros for this tablet:\n-Form factor means it fits in your hand really well.  I have small hands and I can palm it.\n-Screen is actually pretty decent for what you are paying for.  Colors are bright and while a little oversaturated on my unit, they are still pretty good.  Videos look good, blacks are fairly black and whites are white.  The viewing angle is excellent.\n-Micro SD slot.\n-Battery life is decent for what the device is priced at. I am getting about 5.5 hours or so out of it with normal use.\nCons for this table:\n-The biggest issue is the 8GB of on board storage.  With the OS installed there's just over 4GB of space open.  The tablet requires 3.72GB of open space to function properly.  This leaves you with less then 1GB to install apps.  Data from some apps can be moved to an SD cards but apps themselves cannot be.  Basically, there's almost no room to install anything on this tablet if you want it to be usable.\n-Speaker is on the rear.  It is not easy to hear even at full volume if you are in an open space.\n-It's slow.  Not just poky or a little janky, I'm talking downright slow.  The quad-core CPU and 1.5GB of RAM mean nothing  when apps take forever to load off the slow storage in the device.  Smaller apps like Facebook take longer to load then even my 4 year old iPad 2.  Games, if you can get them to install on the tiny storage, have long load times and are full of graphical glitches because of the slow, small storage.\n-The Version of the Android OS that it was supposed to come with is 4.4.4.  Mine had 4.4.2 installed and refuses to find the 4.4.4 update via the software update service.  The Samsung Keis software finds the update but it won't install.  I wound up resetting the device and clearing all my installed apps and it still won't install.  It isn't that big of a deal,  but still, it should have came with what it said on the label.  The Android 5.0 upgrade is supposed to be coming for the device but I'm not holding my breath.\n\nWhat it comes down to is that this is a small, cheap device that's handicapped by the slow, measly amount of storage on board.  Don't buy this tablet.  If you want an inexpensive tablet, pick up an Asus Memo Pad 7 or better yet, a Nexus 7.  Get at least 16GB of storage or more."}

I had the Fire HDX and absolutely loved it but it would constantly restart and I just got too frustrated dealing with that so traded it in. The next tablet I tried was the Acer Iconia 8 and that had a touch screen that was not at all responsive. By the time I got my Galaxy I was over the whole tablet issue! When I got this tablet though I was immediately pleased. I should disclose that I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 already so I loved the fact that the Galaxy Tab was so similar. I immediately had all of the settings, etc exactly how I'm used to them. I was a little disappointed in the display. Going from an HDX to the lower resolution Tab was a bit disappointing, but really for what I use it for it's fine. The speed is pretty good, I did upgrade my storage immediately with an SD card (love that this is option) so I basically tripled my storage for $15. The camera is pretty mediocre. I'd rather take pictures with my phone, but I didn't buy the tablet to take photos. I use my tablet for web browsing, reading on the Kindle App and answering e-mails and texts. For this purpose it's perfect and for the money it's an unbelievable deal. Not to mention you get all of the access that Google Play and Samsung provide. I recommend."}

I bought this as a companion to my Galaxy S5 and its really not a lot bigger than the phone lol, perfect for games and comics and such, not as loud as my phone though surprisingly, guess the tablet doesn;t have as nice of speakers.\n\nThe screen is surprisingly nice for an LED screen even comparing it to my S5's AMOLED screen.\n\nBackgrounds on the tablet from photos can be a pain in the [butt] to set up as well, you may need to crop the photo to be long if you want the device up right, but when you turn the screen it'll be black on the sides and show the middle of the picture.  there may be a way around this, not sure yet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This is a great tablet for the price, and has expandable storage available through the micro SD slot. I have my Tab 4 7.0in running with a Samsung  Evo 32GB card, and it works flawlessly. The response time and accuracy on this tablet seems to be much better than my and older Tab 3.0. I am not sure why Samsung list this as only 32GB expandable for Tab 4 7.0 and Tab 4 8.0. I tested it with my 64GB from my Galaxy S3 and it worked. I have even heard that some people have been able to get 128GB cards to work.\n\nWith the 7 in screen its size is smaller than the iPad Mini, the 8 in Tab 4 model screen size is about the same as the iPad. However, from my research the Tab 4 8\" and Tab 4 7\" models have identical processors and internals (the 8\" model does have a larger battery 4450mAh vs 4000mAh), and since this was for my daughter I didn't see the need for +$90 for the slightly larger screen. I was trying to find a decent smaller size tablet without breaking the bank. The new iPad mini 16 GB is $300 and 64GB is $500!! This Galaxy Tab 4 7\" was on sale new for $130, a 32 GB card was $20, giving me 40GB total memory for $150. This gives me over double the storage capacity, for half the price. In my opinion I prefer the Android OS anyway, due to its better compatibility across different media types and sources.\n\nI would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a small quality Android tablet."}

It is an improvement over the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.  The screen's color is brighter in the Tab 4.  It seems to more more quickly between different tabs.  It also allow for better playing is some of the more complex app games that allow for better playing.  The dedicated home key is much better than the virtual ones on the Tab 2.  This device is more square, which is a moot point for me.  The volume and power buttons are much more tactile and therefore easier to use.\nHaving a choice between white and black is an added benefit.  I wish Samsung offered a version that did not include their TouchWiz interface (I prefer pure Android) but this is still an excellent tablet."}

When playing games, watching videos, or photos, -- it just looks great. The design of the hardware is also a plus. It doesn't feel too big or too small. It fits nicely in your hands.

Resolution is good runs smooth the back camera is decent with pictures and video and the front camera is ok for video calls . some small game apps works ok but you can use developer mode to change some stuff up like gpu an animations . some bloat ware but noting to bad. I didn't think the ir blaster was going be installed from what i seen in the pictures but it is and works on a Samsung tv just fine . prime shipping was reliable and fast no scratches or rips on the box so all in all im happy with It good buy."}

Then I came to the decision between The galaxy tab 3 or 4. Seeing the jump up to the newer 4 was a do able price difference I settled on the 4. I can say I am very satisfied with this purchase. I can also safely say I am happy with the ease of use of the 7 inch.  The screen display is wonderful, the system runs as smooth as possible, and I love all the high-tech features. (Like Smart Stay which keeps the tablet on as long as you are looking at it). I love the fact that the tablet has expandable memory as well. ( that is not an option on kindle). In all truth this is a wonderful purchase in all aspects. I will never lose my trust in Android."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I bought this tablet for me son as an inexpensive emulator device.  He enjoys playing NES, SNES, and other retro games.  The 4.4 android OS does not support using external bluetooth console controllers, so my original idea of pairing my Wiimotes or PS3 controllers with it was no good.  There is no current solution or workaround.  My next idea was to pair up the PS3 remote via USB OTG...alas, the hardware does not support OTG cables (which also nerfs any idea of plugging in an external storage device.)  So, I bought an iPega bluetooth controller which actually works really well with this tablet...but when I tried to plug it into the TV for mirroring, no-go.  It does not support MHL for the micro-SD to HDMI interface.\n\nThis is a great tablet for browsing the internet or reading books...but the lack of power and losing all of the hardware options available in the 10\" model makes it a hard sell."}

Watching something with another person would be a tight squeeze, but maybe that's what you want ;). It hasn't had any major tumbles yet, but so far it's in tip top condition after a couple of minor drops.\n\nI am living in the stone age, and do not yet have a smart phone. This functions as an alternative for me, and I think it would be a great gift for those very few people in your life (perhaps yourself too) who haven't been converted to smartphones.

The tablet is also a nice size; not to big, not to small and not to heavy. It fits in my purse nicely. I use it to go on facebook and read my e-mail. So for what I need...it's great!"}

Nice look to the tablet, battery lasts long enough for her usage, and re-charges quickly.  Great price, too, on the tab (we bought it and the Thankscase cover for the Tab 4 at the same time).  Only drawback with the purchase was the length of time it took to finally arrive...4 days from California to Dallas (no problem), then 4 days \"vacationing\" in the Dallas Metroplex  (problem). Then took 2 more days to arrive here from the Dallas area (185 miles). It makes one wonder why it took less time to travel 1,200 miles than it did 185 miles.  Tracking & estimated date of delivery were way off...my 1st time ever having this problem with Amazon purchases.  Hence, no 5-star rating on this purchase.  I would definitely buy these items again, but would not hold my breath for on-time delivery."}

Spent almost an hour and a half on Christmas day with Samsung support, they were very nice and helpful, but could not fix the problem.  By fooling with settings, volume control and using a trick I found on line, sometimes I could get sound on Netflix, it was very low and if I changed screens or movie, I would lose it again.  Finally they told me the tablet had a problem and return it for repairs, however, they said since it was only 2 days old, to return it to Amazon,  Amazon was great, downloaded shipping label, reboxed it, took to UPS the next day, had my payment refunded to my credit card the next day.  Since I like the tablet and the price, except for lack of sound, I am going to purchase another one and hopefully it won't have a problem with the sound."}

I bought this tablet for my mother for christmas, she unwrapped it today so she could start using it. The tablet is great in all its capabilities and apps and aspects likewise. BUT the main fault in this tablet is the font sizing. sure, the app names were easily read and certain apps were fine, but the main things my mother uses -such as Google search, Facebook, and Google chrome- had fonts so small that you could not possibly have read without zooming in. the problem with consistently needing to zoom in is that once you zoom in you have to do an endless amount of scrolling. We searched for any way to make the fonts larger to no avail. We will be taking it back tomorrow or the next day to try and find a tablet with more reasonable accessibility. I am very disappointed.

The processor is quick enough but nothing to write home about.  The same can be said for the screen, which is big enough to enjoyably watch Netflix but the resolution still leaves something to be desired.  The storage capacity is on the lower end and you will probably need an SD card which must be limited to 32gb.  I feel like the battery life could also be better.  The construction isn't particularly reassuring and the cheap looking fake chrome plastic bezel is just terrible/lazy design.  The \"camera\" was probably a surplus part from a phone made in 2006 and is disappointing, lackluster, and something you won't use.\n\nDespite my long list of flaws, for the price this is definitely an acceptable entry-level tablet or e-reader.  I do like the Tab 4 7.0 for what it is.  However, you can't help wonder what they could have made if they didn't cut corners and I probably would NOT buy this again.  I would buy the 8\" model with better performance."}

I currently have an s5 phone so I figured this would be perfect to use when traveling.  I do like the tablet, but it does have some bloatware and limited internal space.  I would not recommend for someone who wants to install a lot of apps and games as you will run out of space.  I did install a sd card that I use to put videos on from my playlater account.  If you don't know what playlater is you should google it and purchase it so you can record videos to your sd card.\n\nAnyways back to reviewing this table.  The screen is really good and makes for a great video player!  However samsung thinks its a good idea to put the speaker on the back.  The speaker on this sounds clear but even on the maximum volume setting it can be hard to hear.  Build quality is good and its very light to hold.  The camera sucks on it (not sure why they even have one) and battery life is pretty good.  I wish the back key and app key would light up like they do on the phones.  I also wish it had touch feedback when using the back key or keyboard (the little vibration the galaxy s5 makes when touching the keys).\n\nIf you need a cheap tablet to use for movies and internet browsing this is perfect, if you want lots of games and apps look for a tablet with at least 32gig internal storage."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I'm almost entirely satisfied with this product. Its my first tablet and I really like it except for a few faults. After a couple weeks I noticed there was a little black spot underneath the glass. It's about the size of a single pixel, but its not a dead pixel; it looks like a piece of lint contaminated the clean room during the lamination proces and got stuck below the glass. It's not a big deal, but once I noticed it, I can't unnotice it. Another issue is the proprietary Samsung software is irritating. I know that's kind of subjective, but I suspect many folks will have similar hang-ups. I'm not sure if this is Google's fault or Samsungs, but Google Now doesn't seem to work properly with Google Hangouts (google voice.) on the bright side, the specs stated that this tablet only supports a 32 gigabyte external memory card, but I threw a 64 gigabyte card in there and it works properly.\n\nUpdate: About two months after purchase, the Samsung power adapter stopped working. At first I was worried the tablet was broken. The charging icon had a blinking lightning bolt on it and the tablet was refusing to charge. After trying various power adapters and cables I have certainly narrowed it down to the power adapter that shipped with this tablet as being the problem. Not a significant issue, but it is indeed tacky. It doesn't yet change my 4-star rating of this tablet."}

I received the tabs way before the expected delivery date which was awesome. But the tabs are the problem here, I like the look, the size and the battery life seems a lot better but they simply don't work,glitches, running out space and so on. One is a little bit better than the other, which i find it weird as  the tabs are exactly the same. It could download about 9 games that don't work properly, the other struggled to download even one game and when it did it wouldn't work just like the other tab. Now i have lost about 400 dollars  and we are just looking at the tabs as we can not do anything with them only watching you tube videos about the games they like. I wish I had kept the boxes so I could return them back. My boys are sooo desappointed and now they are asking my phone and the old tab 2. 7 which I bought 2 yrs ago but still works perfectly with their games."}

That is remarkable because the use and abuse it went through a lesser tablet would have died in the first couple of months. I bought this for my 6 year old, he's now 8 years old and sad that his little buddy that's been with him so long has finally died. I bought him the 10 inch version of this tablet for xmas so I'm looking forward to many more years of durability and use. Highly recommend this tablet for kids, it can withstand all the drops and spills, even the occasional tantrum pitching it across the room and into a wall then falling to the floor. You can't beat that. Buy this instead of the cheaper versions, you'll get your money's worth.\n\nOh how I love this tablet. I bought it for my son for xmas and I spent 2 nights straight playing with it after he went to bed. It reminds me of a larger version of my old galaxy phone so operating it was a snap. I'm getting one of these after I recover from xmas. The quality of the item is apparent right out of the box, no dinky plastic casing. I have faith this tablet will last much longer than the no-name brands I've been buying for my kids. I'm done with wasting money on garbage. This tablet didn't break the bank however and I've very pleased with this purchase."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "Honestly I'm a bit disappointed. I've used and didn't care for an iphone/ipad. I currently have 2 Windows 8 phones in my house and love the operating system on a mobile platform (wouldn't touch it on a home PC of course!).  I hadn't used any Androids before and figured I should at least try one out before buying a Windows tablet and becoming a Microsoft fangirl for life. I've used it for a week and a half now to give myself some time to get used to it, my son has as well.\n\nTo start, the operating system is laggy. I have fairly cheap Windows phones, not even the newest or best ones. I'm not used to lightning fast or jaw-dropping speed of performance. But this tablet is frustratingly skippy and laggy when opening or switching between things. Nothing closes unless I click multiple buttons to get there to close it.. which is also annoying. I feel like I spend more time opening and closing things than I do using them. If I don't close them, well it's even more laggy.\n\nThe layout is not intuitive. After a week and a half I still feel like I'm hunting for everything other than the apps on the main screen, and each task I perform on it is excessively complicated to do. I am pretty technologically savvy, this thing is just bass ackwards on a few things.\n\nYes, it has a better selection of apps than my Windows phone. Unfortunately I don't need the 10 zillion apps it has that my Windows phone doesn't. Okay, I admit having Candy Crush somewhere other than Facebook finally is nice. But Candy Crush alone does not a tablet make.\n\nThe size and weight is nice, the picture clarity is nice. They're not any more nice than any other comparable tablet would have been. The volume and quality of the speaker is truely awful compared to my phone, and my phone's isn't that great. I'm sure it'd sound better with headphones... I hope.\n\nI have given it a fair chance and will continue to use it since I've paid for it. But I won't buy another in the future unless I suddenly discover the \"make everything better\" button hiding in my apps. My 14 year old son also told me to \"never to buy that crap again\".  I just do not understand how Apple and Google have the lions share of the market when it comes to mobile devices. I can only assume the Android users have never tried a newer Windows phone/tablet."}

Coming from a Galaxy Tab 2, this is a nice upgrade for her.\n\nPros: Compact design, decent resolution, snappy for things like browsing and streaming video\nCons: no flash on back camera, no HDMI out via MHL like other models. This is an annoyance and not really necessary, but it would've been nice to have.\n\nOverall my wife really likes the new tablet."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This tablet has significant issues. I've had it for about 6 months and am completely unimpressed. First, there is a very pronounced lag when browsing the internet. It takes forever for the page to respond and even show that the page is loading. It came this way out of the box, and goes beyond annoying to the point that it makes the browsing feature very frustrating and difficult to use. It is now having issues running basic gaming aps (Catan, Scrabble, Tetris, etc.). I have downloaded fewer than a dozen aps, and the tablet can't even deal - it closes or freezes multiple times per game. It also developed charging issues after only a few weeks and is difficult to get fully charged. There is no point to sending it in to be repaired because Samsung has the worst customer service I've ever experienced, hands down. I've dealt with a defective phone and TV with them and they are an absolute nightmare to deal with. I swore I'd never have another Samsung product but received this as a gift and hoped it would surprise me. It can't do anything my LG phone can't do faster and better. When it dies (which I don't expect to take long) it won't be replaced. Not worth the money at all."}

However, I am returning mine. I decided to chuck out the extra hundred to buy the iPad mini 2 and so far I am much happier with that purchase. Quality difference is very evident."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "Even the two star rating is a bit generous. Like most people, my hopes were clearly too high. What this device's suggested capabilities are compared to it's price point make it a very enticing purchase. Let's start with the pros.\n\n1. It's inexpensive, feels like a small risk.\n\n2. It's size and weight are ideal. I can fit it in the back pocket of my jeans which may not seem like a big deal, but that's truly portable to me. It weighs next to nothing, and makes the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" feel like a million tons. You can use easily with one hand over a long period of time with no hand or arm fatigue.\n\n3. I'm a fan of Android OS, so that's a plus to me. Being a fairly dedicated google user makes it an ideal tablet.\n\n4. Expandable memory, many tablets surprisingly don't offer that as an option which makes them useless to me, unless it's a 32gb or larger device. The specs say it can take up to a 32gb micro sd, but I can verify that it will handle a 64gb card without issue.\n\nNow the cons.\n\n1. The small bezel can be annoying at times. I feel I am a fairly average human man at 6'0 tall and 190lbs, but routinely my thumb will open an app or click on something accidentally because there is literally no room to rest your thumb on the device while holding it in one hand. By contrast, the Kindle HDX 7\" has about a half inch bezel so your thumb rests easily without touching anything on the screen. But to be fair, the HDX weighs as much as a collapsed star so it is not very easy to hold in one hand for longer durations.\n\n2. The most glaring and annoying flaw by far is the WiFi connectivity of this device. It fails to connect so often that it renders using it almost pointless. I have a gigabit router that fuels every device in my home flawlessly. The samsung drops the WiFi connection every few minutes. I opted to test it on different networks (at my brother's house, and at my parent's house) and the same thing happened repeatedly. It's a clear flaw in the build of this device. After a simple Google search, I found way too many forums dedicated to the inability of the Samsung galaxy tab 4 to connect to WiFi effectively.\n\nIn short, at $125 lightning deal I couldn't resist buying it, and I've regretted it every day since I first received it. Buy a Kindle HDX, if you don't require tons of memory then buy the new Fire HD 16gb or the Google Nexus 16gb. Clearly superior devices."}

I can't get anything beyond 2 bars, unless i stand 2 feet from the router.\n- Horrible sound.  You definitely will need headphones!\n- Horrible battery.  Playing any game or watching any movie, maybe 2-3 hours tops on the battery.\n- Not a fan of the Android operating system.  Far from being user friendly.\n\nI also don't like the button layout.

The tab only comes with 8 gigs of storage and almost half of it is used by all the bloteware Samsung preinstall on it with no way to remove it unless you root the tab which can be quite difficult on a Samsung device. By time you add the basics apps your tablet will be out of memory. The tab does have a external SD card slot but Samsung won't let you install programs on it. A matter of fact it won't even let you write or save to the SD card without special programs for rooted users. For people who can root their phones there are apps like folder mount that will force the tab to transfer data to SD card, however its a bit complicated and the apps don't always work. Overall this would be an excellent tablet if it allowed the use of an external SD card for storage."}

I researched and read a lot of reviews before buying this because I was really hesitating whether or not I wanted this, then I ended up buying it since everyone says its so good. I had high expectations for it so thats why i was really disappointed when i found out it really is what you get for the price you pay. The camera is really bad both front and back, no autofocus so i cant even take a nice picture without it being blurry or fluffy looking. It cant play games smoothly, i tested this playing Modern Combat 4 and it would just glitch out or slow down and the screen would look like its cracked or something, so its not smooth for high level games like MC4 or real racing or any high performance high graphic games. the music seems to sound static at high level, and even after putting a samsung 32 gb card in, the storage won't go through right i don't whats wrong with it, so my device is already slowing down and acting up and its only been a week since i bought it. other than that, its really nice and usual for social networks and youtubing and stuff. im just disappointed at how it lags at times or freezes. hoping to sell this to someone so i can get the 8inch one which has snapdragon or a different tablet because i play games on mine often and having it lag or act up is really annoying."}

Coursera does not support mobile devices, so if you want the tablet for this reason you won't be happy.\n\nThe other major problem is that you can't sign out of email with it--there is no option to sign out.  You CAN set up a password for using the tablet though, and that would work for me.\n\nLast problem:  lots of ads and promos from Samsung.  I bought a Samsung laptop 1-1/2 years ago, and it never gave me a problem like this. The Samsung stuff wastes a lot of time.\n\nYou CAN load Google Sheets and do spreadsheets, however, which was surprising.\nI am going to give it a few more tries and than likely return it."}

I was looking for a tablet that I could use the Calibre Companion and had an SD card slot for the extra storage for those books which the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 has.  I was so excited to get started but soon realized that  because of a design choice by Google Starting with android 4.4 (kitKat) which GT4 has, it is almot impossible for CC to use removable SD cards unless your root your devise. So in essence Samsung has giving me an SD Card slot but their system is not allowing me to use it. If I had known this I probably would have continued my search and purchased a different tablet even though I like this tablet in all other respects."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "If you like quality this is not it. The video is not good. I tried known hd videos... I tried known official videos that I have viewed on other tablets, laptops and computers. The video is low grade. I think a tablet is normally used for viewing right? So if the tablet has low quality because of a low quality video card then in this case I cant justify the cost that I paid for this tablet. I bought two at another store other than amazon. Big chain store. The 8gb ram with kitkat not allowing for various needs for storage is another animal in itself. The tablet looks nice even the box it comes in. If you are going to watch movies maybe it looks great but If I cant view a youtube video with quailty I don't want the device. I bought two and took them both back.\n\nI would suggest that you go into a store and try this product out before you buy it. It is unable to play many games out on the android market higher end games I should say. This is a high cost low budget tablet with a top of the line trademark label attached to it. These tablets probably outperform other low budget tablets. So if I were you I would search for any tablet that has tegra 3 or tegra 4 within the description of the tablet you are looking for. I would also look for 16gb or 32gb in that same description you will be happy with your tablet."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This was a birthday present for my child. How am I supposed to tell him \"sorry your tablet has a dead pixel at the top we have to send it back and you'll be without your awesome new birthday present for a few days\" without breaking his heart? So the dead pixel stays. I expect better from a major player like Samsung. It could be worse though. I could've got the Fire Kids Edition for him....\n\nI also don't like how what should be the menu key is a recent key. However some might find that to be a plus.\n\nThe audio controls don't rotate with the screen so if you're watching or playing something and the audio controls are at the top you have to hit the left button to turn it up and right to turn it down. Counter intuitive.\n\nMinus the dead pixel the screen is rather fantastic. The micro SD card slot is easy to use, just the press of a fingernail locks it in and pops it out. Front and rear facing cameras is a plus, there were some comparable tablets that didn't have a front camera. The speaker is stronger than I expected. Overall I'd still recommend this for anyone wanting a tablet under $200."}

(and I'm OLD. How many strikes do I need against me?)\n\nAs far as construction, the Tab-4-7\" looks very well made. Camera is pretty low rez. which is probably ok for the web.\n\nBut IMHO, the Android software SUCKS BIG TIME!  I find navigation very difficult. Chrome is a so-so browser. Android is constantly trying to download software to the tablet.-- I have to shut if off to get it to stop. It seems to me, that Google's Android OS is merely a vehicle for Advertisements. The \"free\" stuff that comes with the Tablet requires you to give up credit card numbers plus lots of personal information before you can get \"free books\", \"free TV\", \"free DropBox\", etc, etc.\n  Oh, and the kicker: I tried to download the Manual onto the Tablet and Samsung tells me that they don't have a manual in my language! (Well, ok, it doesn't speak valley-girl....What Ever!)\n\nI assume I'll be able to transfer music from my Mac, but haven't tried yet.  It would be nice if one could Skype or FaceTime with this, but I don't know if that's possible. It's WiFi only.\n\nI've thought that having a Tablet (or smartphone) would be nice -- possibly a replacement for carrying around my laptop. But after getting this, I don't think so. In fact, I'm not sure what the point of one is, unless it's to provide Big Brother Corporation with all your personal data.\n  On the  Plus side; If I put up with the ads, I can play Angry Birds!"}

However I have been using the screen and it starts to fade out anyway when it doesn't  determine the my eye.  Overall, a useless feature.\n\nOverall, this was not worth the \"upgrade\" from a Tab 3."}

With the ipad minis, all apps, music, and over all functionality must be done a certain way. With the Tab 4 I get speed, the option to add a memory card, and when I plug it into the computer it responds as any other drive. I can drag and drop movies, music, pictures and much more into whatever folder I want to. The screen is absolutely beautiful and the size is just perfect. Very small bezel on each side so holding the tab 4 seems much more comfortable than our ipad minis at school. The ipad mini is too wide to feel comfortable. On my tab 4 I listen to music, watch netflix, watch my own movies, view my photos, and of course to browse the web. I also use it for all my productivity needs like my calendar, my task manager, evernote, and documents using Google docs and WPS documents. I've paired it with my Stowaway bluetooth foldable keyboard and I take notes at meetings just as I would a laptop. I keep everything on my google drive so I always have access to it. For just over a third of what an ipad mini costs, I feel I get more and save a bunch of money."}

Originally I got this so that I could read e-textbooks since my phone couldn't display them, too small a screen size. So I opted for this, downloaded the Kindle app and voila! It displayed all my textbooks! Why not the Kindle tablet itself? Simple enough: I trust Samsung to deliver quality products. This met my expectations, the design is nice and it is very light in my hands. It gives me the versatility and familiarity of an android device. This has expandable memory up to 32GB, so I don't have to stream or rely on the cloud as much since I can just download them onto my MicroSD. Usually I would carry around my laptop at school, added weight, but since buying this I find I don't need to take my laptop. I can use browsers, and word programs thanks to Google.

The one I have does not turn off itself when not being used so the battery dies alot on me.  I would also recommend the larger screen size on this because I found this too small.  Its not small if you are used to the phone but if you are used to a tablet or laptop you will likely be disappointed in the size.  The hard ware is not comparable at all to the ipad but if you mostly want to use this for entertainment or games you may be happy with it.  I use this kind of device for many things like reading books, writing and doing research on the web.  This is not the best device for that.  It is too small and  there is  not a big or good enough keyboard and the wi fi capability is limited.\nIf you cannot afford an ipad this is the next best thing but if you had an ipad and need a new device-get another ipad."}

I have owned a Galaxy S3 for a couple of years and it has NEVER failed me and it's a dynamite product. But a tablet is NOT a phone.\n\nY'see, I own a Kindle Fire HD. It's a great product and I have had NO issues with it, but I hate the restrictions to the Google Store that it imposes on you. So, I decided to shop for a tablet that doesn't have these restrictions. I settled on the Galaxy Tab. Well, I was NOT impressed with it's performance. My 2-year-old Kindle HD 7 Fire out performs it. Here are some of the things that forced me to return this product:\n\n1. The real estate on the web browsers was an annoyance. I couldn't invoke the FULL-SCREEN mode on any of the browsers that I downloaded. Even though the SETTINGS for that feature was checked.\n\n2. The tiny, tiny, itty bitty, speaker. I was so used to the two-speaker stereo sound that my Kindle Fire HD had, that listening to music or watching Netflix was not enjoyable.\n\n3. The storage issue!! Daily I received the OUT OF STORAGE SPACE alert even though I had a 32 GB external SD Card installed. I was forced to CLEAR the cache on the thing daily just to avoid those annoying alerts.\n\n4. The performance of the web browsers. I'm a GEOCACHER and I like to use my tablet to display maps. This tablet's browsers would hang and lag and just get on my nerves whenever I tried to enlarge or scroll. Kindle's browsers never gave me that problem.\n\nThose are the reasons I decided to continue my search for a non-Google Store-restricted tablet."}

With two gigabytes of RAM, it performs most task with ease and took almost anything I threw at it. The display was amazing and I was especially happy about this  because I use this to watch videos, movies, and tv shows. Another reason that I love this tablet that is often overlooked is the fact that it supports 5 ghz WI-FI, making it stream high-quality music and videos much faster than most android tablets of this price. As far as aesthetics go, It's beautiful. I was afraid that getting the white would not be wise because dirt and things of that nature show much more but I was happy to see that it did not easily get dirty and even when it was it was extremely easy to clean. The chrome finish on the white casing gave it a very sleek, high-end look. The size also makes it extremely easy to bring places and hold comfortably. The only reason I gave this four stars rather than five was because the storage space was not very large and the \"touchwiz\" custom ROM takes up a few gig's however, after a little ADB magic I was able to install and run applications on the external SD card which solved my problem."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I pre-ordered the original Ipad and had owned it since launch day.  I loved it.  I carried it everywhere with me and felt like I had arrived in the future. A short time later however ( too short ), I was already disenchanted with the IPAD I had once loved so.  I now hold a strong grudge toward Apple and all it's products.  The IPad was so hard to add music and pictures to as it lacked an SD memory card slot.  I despise ITUNES and the time it would take to add pictures and music to the IPAD.  AINT NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT!\n\nFlash forward to the present.  My once beloved IPAD is now a paperweight. I was dissapointed as I was expecting my first baby and  had hoped to update family, friends and have tons of pictures and music flowing freely.  My amazing husband surprised me with this beautiful addition to our electronic family.\n\nYes, it's smaller than the Ipad. I appreciate the smaller stature of the Galaxy tab.  They have larger available, but i can attest from the IPad, your wrists will appreciate the smaller, lighter Galaxy Tab.  Plus it is easier to transport the Galaxy tab with a baby in my hands too.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab has a beautiful display.  I have all he apps I need, want and more.  The speakers are louder than those on the Ipad.  The Galaxy Tab also has 2 cameras for picture taking/video.  I wish it had a flash though! The processor is super fast and I can have multiple tabs / apps open and switch back and forth without crashing!  The SD card can be upgraded to a larger size to hold lots of precious moments.  Easy to transfer and manage between multiple devices.  I will never Ipad again!\n\nBasically, great price, great features, great product.  Highly recommend!!!!!!!!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "This is a good tablet no doubt about it, but to me, It Does not live up to Samsung standards. Let me start by informing you my tech level is a standard nerd that knows must things tech. The IR blaster for TV use does not work and uses a different version of the standard \"watch on\" app that has less tv and other device brands than the normal \"Watch On\" app on my note 3. Let alone again never could get it working. The battery life is great. The gps is great as well (I use a stand alone navigation app that does not require data). The looks and touch of the screen is of great quality. The camera quality is decent as well. The Bluetooth is a problem. I can get it to connect to my headset but that's it. Can't play music, videos and hear anything so there is no use for the Bluetooth (I even tried using Bluetooth audio apps like mono Bluetooth,  no luck). The headset plug in works only on headsets. You cannot use an audio jack to plug into speakers, car audio, or anything else besides headsets. You can connect the audio jack from the tablet to speakers but it will only screech and blow out your speakers. The WiFi actually has a fairly long range even though it may say no signal waves in the bar, it will probably still work. I have a 40mb/s isp and get just that on the tablet. Some necessary apps that are common do not work properly such as es file explorer, you can not move files. (Note: I have to use the standard file explorer that came with the tablet which does not let me into system directories.) The battery life is great,  BUT it does have a very picky charging issue. You cannot use any charger. I use the usb cord that came with the tablet, but I learned you cannot use anything that gives more than a 2.1 amp or 2100milli amp output. For some unknown reason the charging ability is outdated by about 8 years. The charger it comes with only pushes 1.2amps which takes about 7 hours to charge the tablet, but I use as I said a 2.1amp charger and it takes about 30 min for a full charge. USING A WRONG TYPE OF CHARGER WILL RESULT IN A RED X OVER THE BATTERY, indicating it is not charging. I typically use a 3.5amp charger for all my devices but can't with this tablet. I have a 32gb mini SD which works perfect and I hold my TV shows and movies as well. BUT the audio on this tablet is very bad and cannot play all new movies such as \"The hunger games 2\" even though it is in a standard mp4 format as my other movies are that do work such as the new 2014 godzilla and transformers, age of extinction also 2014.\nAll and all the tablet meets my needs with disappointment. If I would have known all of the issues above I would have bought something else. But this is stuff I slowly figured out as attempting them throughout a month or so expiring my ability to return the device. I still stand by Samsung, but consider the tablet 4 to be a black mark on their rapport. I still use the tablet for my intended needs and will hope for an update to fix the above issues. I was just hoping to use the tablet more than my phone and this tablet has failed at the objective. Again this is a good tablet if the above stuff does not bother you. I have learned to live with it as it does surpass my old tablet abilities by far."}

I have an iPad Mini (the original one) and I love it, but I generally like the Android experience better. I was looking for a 7 inch tablet that would fit better in my various bags/pockets, and was waiting for a good sale. I got it! Being able to add an external memory card was a big plus, too, so I can load up a lot of personal files.\n\nThis has exceeded my expectations. It's not blazing fast, but it's fast enough for most of what I do, and certainly more than what I could hope for at the price I paid. I don't find it to be any slower than my iPad, but I'm not doing heavy duty processing.  I'm in front of a computer most of the day, so it does my heavy lifting. I have loaded the essential apps, and I am set to go. I mainly plan to use it for reading or maybe watching an occasional movie on my commutes and for displaying my portfolio, and for that, it's great. All in all, I think it's a great tablet and a much better deal than the iPad. For on-the-fly music and photo editing, I prefer the iPad, but the Galaxy Tab handles everything else very well.\n\nI like the WatchOn app and some of the other Samsung exclusives. The $10 Google Play credit and 50GB of Dropbox were nice little perks too."}

My only gripe is the 3 button interface is noticeably less intuitive than the 4 button interface on my HTC Incredible phone.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "Being a previous owner on many different tablets, I have some initial thoughts about this Samsung Galaxy Tab at first.\n- RAM- The amount of RAM on this tablet is very limited. How limited?- 1.5 GB of Memory usage available not considering what the system software uses. I average out freely 800 MB when I'm using low-processing apps. The tablet seems to take a toll when I try to browse on Chrome with several tabs open and play music on Spotify or YouTube in the background. Regardless, for the price you get what you pay for here in this range. Either way, I consider my Nexus 7 (which is only a few dollars more) a more high end tablet.\n-Screen- Actually, the screen is really great all HD! One thing is the menu buttons do not illuminate.\n-Power- The power consumption is great on this tablet I usually play music and noticed no drainage when it comes to browsing the web and music. Video does drain it considerably.\n-Software- I absolutely despise bloatware. Samsung is guilty here of this one. Some of the apps can not be disabled but doesn't take up RAM so in the end I guess we can cope. If you have ever used the Galaxy phones or tabs before you'll be familiar with the user interface.\n-Camera- Ehh. 5 and 3 Megapixel. You are better off using your phone but comes in handy.\nOverall, its a good starter tablet."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "We purchased 2 of these tablets on a special deal at Office Max this fall. Our plans are to use the tablets for homeschool and fun on the go with our elementary school kids (ages 6 and 8).\n\nI have been an iPad2 user for about 3 years, and knew that there would be some differences. The differences go beyond the operating system and branding. Not only do we have some privacy concerns, but we also wish someone had given a better explanation of how you ARE limited to the internal storage capacity of the device. The removable storage does not support apps or software installation (read last part of this review). We have had these tablets for less than a month, and we are already being forced to delete apps. THE DEVICE IS FULL !!! (we have 16 GB micro-SD card installed, and it still has over 13 GB free, but we can not install even one more app)\n\nWhat we like:\nVery lightweight & portable\nPerfect size for small hands\nEasy to find cases and accessories - be sure get the screen protector from Armor Suit!\nThe screen resolution and graphics are amazing\nThe camera is easy to use & takes great pictures\nThe tablet is a great value\nIt works great as a TV remote control, and you can view some apps and online videos on your TV using this device\n\nSome differences we noticed right away:\nThere are built-in \"features\" that are too invasive for family use, in my opinion:\n\n- If you enter your pattern passcode incorrectly more than twice, the tablet takes your picture and emails it to your registered email account. I can see that this is a great security feature when you lose the tablet, but I found it disquieting, to be receiving multiple pictures of myself and my young children, several times a day. The tablet is taking pictures of you, without your realizing it... There is no way to turn this off. The only solution we have found, is to put a small sticker over the front-facing camera. (I realize that we are being recorded everywhere we go. My husband works for a company that helps manage this new phenomenon of information overload. I would like to restrict outside access to what happens inside my home, as much as I am able... There is really no need for Google (or whoever it is) to be taking pictures of us all day.)\n- The \"smart screen\" that has to sense your eyes, in order to keep the screen running: If you are looking at the tablet, the screen remains active. If you look away or set the tablet down, it turns off within 30 seconds, requiring you to unlock it again to use it. Since we have covered the camera, to avoid our pictures being added to the big database in the sky over and over again each day, our tablets will shut off if we stop touching them for more than 30 seconds.\n- You can turn off this \"power-saving\" feature in the settings menu, but it does not actually change the setting. Each time I have tried to change the setting from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, it resets within 5 minutes, even with continued use. VERY irritating!! How productive can you be, if you have to keep unlocking your tablet while you are working on something??\n- When my daughter turned on her Galaxy Tab, it automatically installed all the apps that are on my tracfone, and all of my Google contacts were also in her tablet (which included everyone who had ever sent or received an email from that email address).\n- MANY and I mean MOST of the apps that we have installed ask for ridiculous access and require \"permissions\" to access your information, including your complete network information, your Wifi connection and anything that is attached to it, your contact, access to your phone calls, ability to make and receive calls and text messages, access and delete information on your USB storage... and prevent your device from sleeping (this has drained the battery dry more than once). I don't understand why a Garifled game app would need access to my complete network and identity information.\n\nThe biggest realization came yesterday, after about 45 minutes of online chat support through Samsung's website (he was either very bad at typing, or was completely unfamiliar with the technology and specifications). You ARE limited by the internal storage capacity of this device.\n- When we purchased these tablets, we were \"sold\" on the idea that you could upgrade your storage capacity - \"Unlike the iPad! You can upgrade your memory capacity!\" The tablets even came with a free micro-SD card with a 16 GB capacity - doubling the storage of the tablet, right out the door! What a GREAT idea!\nTHIS STATEMENT IS NOT COMPLETELY ACCURATE. There is a difference between internal and removable storage, and what it can do. You can NOT install apps to a removable disk. Since we have downloaded several apps and games for kids, our device is already giving us error messages about \"insufficient space.\" After 3 weeks of use, I am forced to delete apps from the device... games and apps that the kids still want to play and use...\n\nIf you are someone who likes to use educational or game apps for kids, be informed before the salesman tells you what a GREAT deal you are getting on this type of setup. A Best Buy employee recently tried to talk me OUT of buying a new $800 iPad Air, and moving to a Samsung. He showed me the cost savings, and told me that with the iPad, you are paying extra \"for the name.\" NOT TRUE!!\n\nGoogle will get into your private business as much as it can, and you will be forced to give it permission to access your entire network and identity, when you download their Android apps. They will take photos of you, whenever they choose. The \"upgrades\" in storage (via the SD memory) are only useful for pictures, videos, music, and other data you add.\n\nI think this tablet would be great for someone who does not want to install very many apps. If you want to use it to create documents and take notes, it will probably work great. We had intended to install Microsoft Office 365 on these, but I have yet to see how much space that software will consume. We are going to be forced to delete several of our apps.\n\nThe external storage will be useful for storing pictures and videos. Kids love taking pictures and videos!\nToo bad we have to sacrifice the productivity and fun potential... but NOW I KNOW.\n\nI hope this information helps someone else. All in all, we are pleased with this purchase... but BE INFORMED before you buy.\nThink about what you will use it for, and consider getting a tablet with more internal storage capacity."}

Had a 10\" tab but it was just big enough to not be comfortable carrying around so it often say at home.  This 7\" size is perfect to carry around and big enough to watch news video or even a movie.\nIt doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the 8\", but I had the big one before with all that and rarely needed it as my Galaxy 4 does just about everything I need...this 7\" tablet just makes prolonged use of similar features a lot easier.  With a dialer and texting apps over WiFi (tethered from my phone), I often just leave my phone in my bag now.\nOnly critique is lack of camera auto focus and lack of auto screen dimming...I wouldn't have thought those to be that expensive to have. Makes the camera useless and I use an app for converting paper to PDFs all the time and doesn't work so well without auto focus.\nNext phone will be as small as possible and keep something like this with it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "Outside of an all-in-one desktop computer, this is my first purchase of this kind of technology.  Even the cell phone I have is a cheap pay as you go phone that I use to check email sometimes.  If memory serves me right, it cost me about $15 at Best Buy about 3 years ago.  So anyhow, I'm a newbie at this sort of thing.  After a few days of using the Tab 4, I think it's great but wish it had a phone included at only a slightly higher price range, say, $50.  I purchased this on a spur of the moment impulse and really it's just to watch videos during lunch break or sometimes during my commute (however, this will be rare as my commute is usually dedicated to reading).  One of the best things about this product is that Samsung has free chat help online.  Please, NEVER get rid of this.  This will keep me a customer for life!  Don't start charging for it and don't cut the service.  Hidden expenses besides the roughly $180 plus tax?  Well, you will need a case.  Mine cost $30 in the store.  Some were even more.  But you can find them at half that online.  But get something solid to keep it protected.  You will also want to get the 32gb SD card.  Some comments online state that the 64gb card will work, too.  I asked Samsung in the chat and was told \"no,\" which doesn't make it true, but it's not in the specs, which state a limit of 32gb.  The learning curve, after some tech help, is kind of quick.  Once you see how some things are done, it starts to get easier figuring out other stuff for yourself.  This morning I set up something called WatchOn.  I thought it was to watch cable on the Tab.  But as I afterward found out, it only converts your Tab 4 into a TV/Cable remote.  Really, they should name the app differently.  WatchOn means something entirely different.  There is an app for reading books.  I don't plan to use it as I own several thousand books and still love the feel of a real book.  One feature I like is a program that reads PDF and Word files.  I have a Word file of over 50 pages listing all my books so when I'm out I don't buy stuff I already have.  But I have to carry around a printed version.  Now I can just open it in the Tab 4.  When I was transferring movie files there was a popup asking me if I wanted to convert the movies as they may not play.  Convert them to what?  I'm not sure.  But I said no and they played just fine.  They are m4v files that I made using handbrake.  There is a camera and a video camera (the camera has a front and rear picture option, one of which the quality is a little better in terms of pixels and image size).  The user manual can be downloaded online and explains a lot more than I can here (it also came with a little booklet that I haven't even looked at yet).  Anyhow, there are a lot of features on this device.  Games, etc.  Right now I don't really want to get involved in these things as I want to stay focused on reading.  But for others, I'm sure you'll find lots of interesting things to keep you occupied.  Oh, one more thing.  I bought this Zagg screen protector.  Waste of time for me.  The directions were lousy and I had to throw it out.  What I found out is this though.  In order not to touch the screen directly I wrapped the skimpy (thin) micro cloth that came with the Zagg screen around my index finger and the Tab 4 worked just fine, reacting to my touch as if it were my finger.  I suppose any eyeglass micro-fiber cloth should work fine, too.  In closing, great product and I hope to get several years of good use out of it.  I will definitely buy again from Samsung if they continue putting out a great product with great online help."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "Very good for the price. I currently use an S5 for my main phone so I was used to the Samsung ecosystem. The TAB 7 inch is great and I'll lay out a few pros and cons here.\nPros:\nPrice is reasonable.\nVisually appealing tablet,  it's very simply designed with the iconic samsung look.\nWorks well on most tasks such as Netflix, reddit, light gaming,  etc.\nTouch wiz ui has been scaled down to the basics. You can definitely pick it up and run with it.  Was looking for something a little more basic so it worked well.\nCons:\nIt is my understanding that you can pick up faster tablets for around the same price such as nexus 7.\nCurrently this model can't be rooted by towelroot.\nCameras are very basic so don't expect much there. App is quick to open and snap pics though.\nHave noticed a bit of lag when several apps are running which can be fixed by closing them.\nEven though the tablet is 8gb in size,  you only get around 3 gigs of storage space.  Definitely will want to get an SD card here. The official supported size is up to 32gb but I've heard users mention 64 gig cards work in their tablets.\n\nOverall there are good and bad things about it. While there are faster or fancier options available for you to try,  I like this tablet because of its size, basic features, good battery life, and user interface. It's a great option if you want something simple for simple tasks."}

I bought her a 9.7\" tablet running CyanoGen mod Android but she felt it was too heavy and bulky to hold. Her phone I felt was too small to use while at home and relaxing. A phone with a 4.7-5\"~ screen is fine, but I felt that when at home and you have other options it is better to find a compromise. I purchased this Tab 4 7\" as a surprise for her and she loves it. She uses it all the time and at only 0.61lbs. it is lightweight and the perfect size to comfortably hold. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7\" is a great tablet. It falls in the middle for overall innovation and quality. It has a decent quad-core processor, is running the newest Android 4.4 KitKat and has a high quality screen while at the same time not being overloaded with stuff that is not needed if all you want is a good, solid tablet to play games, watch movies and go online."}

The Home, back, and what they now call the \"Recent key\" are fixed, they do not rotate with the display. They are not lighted so forget it if you plan on using the tablet in the dark.\n\nThere are too many useless app on it that can not be uninstalled.\n\nI installed a 32G SanDisk Ultra Plus card. The slot for this is really cheesy. At first I thought is was broken, but finally got it to work.\n\nIf you run anything with a lot of graphics it will be slow. That also applies to a large database that I tried to run. Movies may lag or be jerky and the sound out of sink. It will completely stall on occasion while playing FreeCell (by Brainium). It may take up to five minutes to recover from this.\n\nWhile the Nexus 7 (old version) we have is larger and heavier it out performs the Galaxy Tab 4 by a large margin.\n\nAmazon also receives zero stars for deliver on this.

It is a nice size to tuck into a purse. While the screen is small, it has good resolution and is easy to read. Battery life is good (5-6 hours), but not exceptional, and charging time is fairly slow. The cameras are decent, but not exceptional with 3 megapixels rear and 1.3 mp front. I have been disappointed to learn that it can apparently only accommodate a 32 gb sd card, especially because internal memory is only 8 gb. I was also initially disappointed that it was not possible to root this tablet, although that has since been remedied."}

The speaker placement is on the back so when you but the tab down the sound is completely muffled. The music stops playing if you get a notification and it doesn't play from where it stops. Ive had mine freeze up a couple of times and I wasn't even running an app. And lastly the volume, it's very low even at its highest. I like to drown out everything around me but the volume isn't loud enough. Otherwise it's a good buy it fits in almost all bags/purses so easy for travel and the quad processor really makes a difference compared to the tab 3's dual processor."}

Sitting in my Kitchen, I have \"5 bars\" (wifi) on my notebook computer and my Galaxy S4 Phone but the TAB 4 can't maintain a connection from this location. It requires much closer proximity to the wifi access point to work satisfactorily. I don't understand why they can't make the WiFi work as well as it does on my old stuff from 5 years ago ???\n-\nThey moved the speaker to the back and it has very low sound output compared to the TAB3.  Even when connecting a good Altec Lansing speaker that I have used with the TAB3, the output is low.  I never ran the volume at 100% on the TAB3.  100% volume is necessary for most occasions with the TAB4.\n-\nSome applications don't work. The Menu button (bottom) left now requires PRESS-AND-HOLD to bring up the Menu for applications . .  however not all applications work with this new requirement.  I have found 3 apps that I can no long use and 1 of them is critical and may not get updated by Leviton, our security system manufacturer. This isn't a problem with the Tab 4 itself, just a inconvenience when operating systems change and apps don't keep up.\n-\nThe screen still does not scroll smoothly on long web pages - a performance problem.\n\nAfter pointing out its problems, it is still the best choice for my use because of the size and general quality."}

There maybe better ones, ones with bigger screens, ones with more memory, ones that may be faster.  Don't know.  My only experience is with the Samsung Tab 4.  One reason this is my first tablet is I didn't think tablets could even come close to the functionality of a laptop.  I was wrong.  Bought a new laptop at the same time I bought the Samsung tablet, after a week I gave the new laptop to my wife.  Don't know how this stacks up against the other Tablets out there but the Samsung Tab 4 formed my opinion on Tablets!"}

It cannot connect properly to public hotspot like Xfinity at the stations. Probably, it won't be able to connect to hotspot connections at the airport, though I've never tried.\n\n2. It performs really unstably with its wifi function. I often see it losing internet connection unpredictably, either at my home wifi, or at my school wifi. I thought it was because the connection itself, then I noticed my iPhone was connected peacefully while the tablet performed that bad. Additionally, it always forgot my home connection's password. I have to re-enter the password every 2-3 days.\n\n3. Its OS is claimed to be Android Kit kat  4.4 which should be supported on Google Cast Apps (especially Chromecast). It doesn't work properly with Chromecast in actual. It often lost connection with my Chromecast's TV (while my Galaxy Phone works really well). Further more, I couldn't cast my tablet's creen into TV. So I probably say that its Operating System doesn't work properly on the tablet itself either.\n\nBy the way, it is the 4th one of Galaxy Tab 4 that doesn't work properly. I would request a standard refund if I didn't purchased Apps for the tablet."}

When I was reading a web page, the screen would suddenly disappear, and something unrelated would pop up. There is a button (one of three) on the bottom of the device (as pictured here) whose only function seems to be to cause a pop-up window that essentially says \"this button doesn't do anything.\" I am not kidding! (Samsung apparently used to use this button for some purpose that they've discontinued. Unfortunately, they didn't deactivate or re-purpose the button; instead they decided to use an obnoxious pop-up tell you that nothing is happening. I know this doesn't sound real, but it is.) Worse, this button is positioned such that, if you use the tablet in landscape mode, the edge of your hand tends to activate it unintentionally. There were other frustrations as well. Bottom line: I couldn't return this tablet fast enough."}

The screen looks gorgeous, I don't understand why people complaint about it, the colors are very vivid and the videos look wonderfully amazing!!!\n\nIt's very good for multitasking but average for gaming, so if you're heavy on the games department (high end games of course), you should probably look at the Nexus. The multi user mode is gold!!!\n\nI highly recommend this tablet, I doubt theres any other better at this price point."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I really wanted this tablet to replace my full size iPad 3, but it turned out to be a total piece of crap. It feels cheap and flimsy and the dimensions are not really ideal for anything. Too small to do serious reading on, too heavy to hold while lying down. The back cover is cheap plastic and has an awful lumpy texture and is just not pleasant to hold. The tablet is light but that is almost negated by how thick it is. The iPad, although heavier, is thinner, more ergonomic, feels a lot less buggy, and just generally works better. I gave the Samsung tablet two stars instead of one because technically it's a working tablet and can run most of the same apps, but the user experience is severely lacking. I don't know if I got a defective model, but I also could not remove an external SD card once I put it in. Normally it should just click in and click out, but the second part didn't work. I mostly need a tablet for extensive PDF reading, and the little details make a big difference. It seems that with the iPad, everything is just slightly but significantly smoother, so that the overall experience is much better. More respnsive touchscreen, better keyboard, everything feels snappier, less crashing, etc."}

The Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 is lightweight and unlike my Kindle, it has a camera. Not a very good camera, but for closeups, it's okay. As other reviewers have mentioned, the pictures are fuzzy. I thought I could correct the fuzziness in my photography program but I can't. I will try adjusting the camera settings and see if that helps. I DID NOT buy this tablet to take pictures. I bought it to run a program which is not available for Kindle. I have also downloaded the Amazon Store and purchased apps but keep getting a message that I need to purchase the app. It has nothing to do with Amazon and everything to do with the Google Store that comes installed on the tablet. I need to do more research and change some settings. Tablet clarity, the touch screen and ease of use make this the best choice for me. I have a digital camera for taking pictures."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "After owning a cheap $69 tablet, it is a relief to have one that doesn't slow down to the point of barely working after a month. I mostly like this, just didn't like the following in regards to this Samsung Galaxy tab 4 7inch.\n\nUSB hosting - this 7 inch tablet doesn't do it. Very disappointed, because the cheapo tablet I owned before did. After doing some internet research, it sounds like only the 8 and 10 inch tablets do this. So now I kind of wish I had bought the tab 3 in the 8 inch version, instead of the tab 4 7 inch.  I really wish I could put pictures from my camera onto the tablet. I like to share pictures this way when I am on vacation. I tried with a USB-OTG cable with no luck. If anyone figures out how to do this, I would love to know.\n\nAmazon instant video - I was holding out on getting a prime membership because it really bugged me that I couldn't stream amazon instant video onto an android tablet. I don't want to go out and buy a kindle or ipad just to watch it. I finally decided to get prime, and found very helpful people on the internet.  Here is the simple solution - get the Dolphin browser app. Dolphin allows you to watch flash. However, amazon now uses silverlight instead of flash, but there is a work around for that too. You no longer have to go online and download special packages, it's all updated. (When I did my research, people said I had to side load the Dolphin jetpack, but I didn't, it must be updated now). All I did was this:\n\nInstall the dolphin browser app in the playstore.\n\nIf you try to play amazon video, it will ask you to install silverlight. It won't play, because you need to use flash.\n\nSo then, when you are in the dolphin browser, go to the amazon page, then go to the amazon instant video page or amazon prime page. (You can do this part from any browser and from any computer)\n\nThere is a link at the top more towards the right, that says \"settings.\" Click that, then scroll down to where it says Web Player Preferences. It will probably be checked on Silverlight.  Change it to use \"flash\" instead of \"silverlight.\" Then you are good to go! I don't know if this affects playback on your other devices, but now you can watch your prime content on your tablet. Hope this helps.\n\n (This is just a long explanation for downloading dolphin browser and changing the settings to use flash instead of silverlight. Just thought some people might need more explicit directions.)"}

In comparing the two of them, I cannot tell any difference in processor speed. I preferred the sound -much better on the Kindle and the video screen, better on the Kindle. The Kindle is heavier and has an Amazon modified android system which you can work around - frankly I prefer straight android- the Samsung uses KitKat which is enough different from Jelly Bean to require getting use to it. The Samsung can take a 32 gb micro sd card which gives it much more memory than the Kindle and for me the breaker regarding the Kindle is battery life. Leaving it off with WiFi connected drains battery life. I am not a heavy user and mostly read and check emails. With the Kindle, I was charging every two days and with the Samsung , much less frequently"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "When a non-tech savvy friend asked me to set up her tab 4, I was totally impressed by its speedy wireless capability--it picked up wireless fast, even before my ipad 4. I then sold my previous Samsung 7 inch model (which I kept in my purse for its GPS), with lousy wireless but with a roomy 32 gb drive, to purchase this model since what I needed most was a gps unit with reliable wifi. Unfortunately, the tab 4 7 inch does not come bigger than 8 gb. AND don't think that the SD card helps out here--the kit kat OS does not allow the transfer of apps to an external card the way previous OS do. (Thank you, Google, for this limited OS.) So I had to give up previously purchased apps because they do not fit on this device. At least I have a small device that actually does what I need it to do most--reliable GPS and speedy and reliable wireless in a small package for a purse--but NO ROOM FOR APPS, even on an SD card.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "My Kindle Fire recently became a paperweight when its touch-screen became unusable. I really wanted to replace it with an iPad Mini, but was discouraged by the price and the fact that the WiFi version didn't have GPS. I wanted a new Kindle reader that doubled as a moving-map GPS. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 does all that for not much more than the cost of a Kindle Fire HD.\n\nPros:\n  GPS!\n  Great fit and finish\n  Bright, clear screen\n  Front and back cameras\n  Small and light\n  SD slot for up to 32GB expansion, if you can use it\n  Includes charger\n  Cheap accessories\n\nCons:\n\n  Only 8GB internal storage\n  Flaky WiFi\n  KitKat problems\n\nReview:\n\n  I have a drawer full of crummy Android tablets. Anything priced less than $100 is a bad bet. Some tablets, like the Viewsonic G-Tablet, are good hardware but lack any decent software support. Others just break in a short time. I was tired of playing Android Roulette.\n\n  The first thing that impresses you with the Tab 4 is its build quality,light weight and thinness. I found the screen to be somewhat better than the Kindle Fire HD: it's whiter and brighter, easier to read, even in sunlight. I bought an i-Blason cover for $8, much cheaper than the typical Kindle cover at $40 and just as serviceable. The cover includes a pen/stylus, which can help when touching small buttons.\n\n  There are other bonuses, including front and rear-facing cameras. The Tab 4 has been criticized for its low-res 3MP rear camera, but it's adequate for many uses. I added a 32GB SD card. This is essential when using a large content apps like the moving-map Sygic app, which BTW is awesome.\n\n  My first impression of Android tablets was not good; many just looked and behaved like overgrown phones. The Samsung version of Android, while also used in its Galaxy phones, seems more appropriate to tablet use, similar to iOS implementation on Apple products. I was satisfied by the customized Android OS on the Kindle Fire, but now prefer the relative freedom and ease of use of the Tab 4, plus the availability of both the Samsung Galaxy Store as well as Google Play.\n\n  I think the Tab 4 is a very good piece of hardware, but I docked it a star owing to issues related to its KitKat OS.\n\n  It has problems when using external SD cards under KitKat. Google has made external storage much more restricted and apps must be able to move their files into the external cards' /Android/data folder. While there is a button under Settings that says \"move to sd card\" it really moves it to an emulated sdcard in device memory. Fortunately, Sygic can deal with this problem and will move its files to external storage if you follow the steps on their website. I tried similar tricks to move Kindle files but it still reverts to emulated storage. I hope Amazon issues an update that will address this problem. Meanwhile, you only have 3.5GB available unless the app is \"KitKat aware\". This is a serious limitation. I've tried many apps, e.g. music players, and they won't show music files if they are in external storage. The only way I can consistently copy files into external storage is to hook up the Tab 4 to my PC and use Windows Explorer to do it. The only surefire way to fix this involves \"rooting\" the device or using adb, which I don't want to mess with at this time.\n\n  It often drops WiFi connections. Since I didn't buy the Tab 4 for heavy online use it is an annoyance, but not a major one. Turning off all the auto and constant network scanning options (Settings/Wi-Fi/Advanced) seems to help. When all else fails, do a full shut-down and restart; once it starts to drop its connections it just gets worse.\n\n  While I wish I'd bought the 8\" version and the WiFi can be a pain, the Galaxy Tab 4 is the best tablet I've used so far, especially for a price not much higher than the Kindle Fire HD. I wanted to give it 5 stars, but the KitKat issues are too irksome. Until KitKat gets fixed I would be wary of assuming newer is better. At the same time I really like using it as a Kindle reader and it's outstanding as a GPS device. If you can tolerate the KitKat \"features\" it is a great value."}

Glacially slow. And unfortunately, it must be said, unusably slow. Among modern tablets, speed should be about whether you can use games or how long it takes things to launch. Speed shouldn't mean the tablet is so overwhelmed by basic tasks that it doesn't register clicks or that if something is updating in the background it becomes unresponsive. Sadly, this is how the Galaxy behaves.\n\nI bought my daughter a Kindle Fire HD and it outperforms the Tab in every way. If you want a decent 7\" tablet and can live without the \"full\" Google experience, it's a lot better device for less money. It makes no sense as the processor speeds are nearly the same and the Galaxy sports twice as many cores. However, when you have the two in your hands, that's how it is."}

I wanted something smaller, but good enough for movies, books, and overall media consumption. I also wanted something that complemented by Galaxy S3 phone. The Tab 4 7 inch hits on all those points very well.\n\nFor starters, the build quality of the device is superb. The silver lining to the plastic casing adds enough class for any American (because we love our chrome) and acts as a metaphor to Samsung's pledge to near Apple-like quality. I chose the candy white model and it looks great. The plastic doesn't feel cheap and it has a nice weight to it. It seems it's internals are tightly packed resulting in a very thin profile. The thin bezel on the sides really help carry its slim style forward as well. I noticed other tablets like the MeMo 7 inch and LG G Pad 7 inch, which have thicker bezels, and it detracted from the overall experience of the tablet.\n\nThe 7 inch screen is glorious. The colors are washed (grayed) very slightly, but I didn't notice until I read an Engadget review about it. The brightness of the tablet exceeded many of the others in its class. Its really bright and it helps when viewing in direct sunlight.\n\nThe downside to the tablet is the performance, but I never felt like it left me hanging for too long. Applications might take a bit-longer to open and the Touchwiz UI may not be as smooth as it's higher-end pro series kin. None the less, again, I never felt impatient. A better way to put it is that the performance was very consistent -- slower than other higher-spec tablets but consistent, and I find that meeting expectations with regards to performance is better than having a high-spec tablet that has unexpected slowdowns (in the case for the Asus Tegra tablets). The Tab 4 7 inch is not using the Snapdragon S400 chipset as originally suggested by several review sites. It's using something else. Also, don't expect to play games very well; even Angry birds (when zoomed out) had some noticeable lag when panning across the map. That said, Minecraft played very well with some of the graphics settings turned down.\n\nThe tablet also has 1.5GB of memory, which is 500MB more than most in its class. But Samsung is going to need that extra 500MB for its hefty Touchwiz UI and bloat-apps. However, samsung allows you to \"turn off\" apps, many of which come preinstalled.\n\nAll-in-all this is a fantastic tablet. I've went back and forth between several other 7 inch tablets (Asus MeMo, LG G Pad, Nexus 7), and its performance and specs are very yesteryear. However, regardless of those downsides, there's some about it that I just love that goes beyond it's performance. When taken as a whole, I love the tablet and I can't put my finger on it as to why. I don't know if its the way that Samsung designed it with its sleek design or it's TouchWiz UI, but the entire package is fantastic. I've went back to the store maybe 2-3 times to try the other tablets. Yeah, they performed a little better, but that Samsung tablet caught my eye and I never regretted buying it.\n\nIt's on the shelf for $170 when I bought it, and it's worth every penny of it, I just wish they put a better chip on the inside."}

I loved it but it's just slow and out dated now. I needed something a bit smaller for meetings and to use at work so I thought I'd check out some of the newer Samsung Tablets.\n\nAfter playing around with this one for a bit, I was sold. The multitasking feature is really amazing. I can look at my email and a spreadsheet at the same time on one screen. Pretty cool!\n\nIt weighs almost nothing. It's a very good size as well.\n\nIt was between this one and the 8\" Samsung 4 Tab. But for the money, I could see that the 8\" was worth all that more. You get a little more screen size and more storage. That's about it. Seeing how this is primarily for work, I didn't think it would be a big deal.\n\nIt's very speedy and snappy. The screen looks amazing, though, not as amazing as the new Galaxy S Tab. But still pretty bright and crisp.\n\nThe TV controller is a really neat feature. Didn't think I would use it much but it's actually pretty useful.\n\nOverall, I'm amazed by this little tablet. It's fast, useful, and the perfect size."}

Setup was easy, adding apps was great, the screen was brilliant, and I really liked the experience.  SADLY, however, the wifi connection kept dropping.  A quick search of some forums revealed this is a common problem people are encountering. I had the latest downloads (it auto-updated that same day) and I tried it on multiple wifis (home - simple open network, coffee shops), but sadly, after about 10 minutes, it would drop the wifi connection.  The only way I was able to get it working again was to restart the device. I took it back to the store today to return it.  Now I'm looking for another Android tablet roughly the same size and storage.  Disappointed this didn't work out because it was a nice tablet, just a commonly experienced problem that has yet to be resolved."}

So when searching for a tablet for myself (as my daughter kinda took over the one I got from my phone carrier) I was not hesitant to go with the latest Samsung Galaxy tab. However I have to say I'm a tad bit disappointed. My other tablet is an LG g pad 8.3 and dang near everything about it is better. The camera sucks, it's horribly slow, I had multiple issues getting it set up (more on Google end than the tablets but a pain with how slow it is) needless to say I set it up to switch with my daughter. She shouldn't notice a huge difference with the way it runs with what she uses it for. I'm just really disappointed in this product as I've come to expect great things from Samsung and in my opinion this tablet was far from great.

And It was about $20 cheaper going through Walmart today. I had high hopes for this device as I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7 inch) and it worked wonderfully and was very happy with it. I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 as I decided it was time to upgrade. Little did I know that Kitkat (4.4 Android OS) handicaps your SD card in that it is much harder to move apps to your SD card. I can not put many apps on this device as I would like as I can not move my apps to my SD card. I was able to do this with my old Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. I'm not able to fully enjoy my tablet due to this limitation as I sometimes like to download 1+GB size games onto my tablet. My review would be higher if I could use my SD card to it's fullest extent and enjoy all my purchases for apps. The screen looks excellent on this little device (a big reason why I wanted to upgrade, that and wanted a quad core processor in my tablet).

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "The Samsung Galaxy Tab 4's rear facing camera has a problem taking detailed shots, like the information sticker on electronic devices. After two puchases of the same model, the same problem. I understand it is only a 3MP so, well. The Galaxy Tab 3's camera was near perfect. This is one beautiful device, though. The colors, the colors of the display, whew, they just make me drunk, they are so good! It does everything, games , videos, photos, notes, Google Search, Google Play, books, internet, cameras, research, stereo, music and more. I had the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and I liked it especially for the comfortable shape and the slightly better cameras. The Tab 4 is squarish in shape, thinner and rests comfortably in your hands also. My Tab 4 has 8GB installed, so I added another 16GB. And the way I load apps and info, Im at least going to need a 32GB later. (just heard that you can use a 64GB card!) Hmm. It was suggested by another user to upgrade to the Tab 4 8.0 for more memory, screen size & resolution, and larger SD Card contents. But I said, nah. I have large hands and this is a perfect fit, just what I wanted. I have not tried the competitors tabs because they were expensive and the Tab 4 did the job w/o the high price. The new design, speed and memory are definetly up to par. Very easy to set up, e-mail and an offers from DropBox to save your data in case of loss and an offers from Samsung for free stuff from the Google Play store, not bad. The beautiful thing about the Google Play Store is they will honor your purchses in case you get a new device,(Just-In-Case/My Girlfriend). I especially like the Blutooth so I can wirelessly control my optional keyboard and speaker and the Tab 4 can act as a remote control,too. The test I use to check out a machine is to benchmark the loading (turning on times)running large games to check for lag, color correction and smoothness, and the ultimate camera test, (night shots-they must be clear!). In essence Samsung has done it again. Jus sayin' Thanks. (Right now - 7/20/2014 There is a war going on! The price has dropped $30.00 on Amazon!)I give it 4 stars due to the camera."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I have had this for one month.  I will be returning it and using a Nexus 7 (Asus; 2013 model).  The deal breaker has been the camera, though I have a couple other gripes.  I previously had an HTC flyer which had a 5mp camera and took great shots.  When it died I bought this Galaxy Tab 4.  The Tab has only a 3mp camera and pictures turn out blurry, especially in low light.  I took my Tab to the store and did side-by-side photo comparisons with a Nexus 7 (Asus) and there was a huge difference in brightness, color, and ability to frame the shot.  For some reason, the Tab's camera seems to be slightly zoomed in.  For example, it is hard to take a picture of person sitting across small table as they are too zoomed in.\n\nIn summary, these were the reasons I liked Nexus 7 better:\n1. Better camera (5mp v 3mp)\n2. MUCH brighter white screen.  Tab seems almost grey at it's brightest setting.\n3. Wifi disconnect issues; the Tab has to be reconnected to my home Wifi several times per day.  I've read it's a Kitkat problem, but I am NOT having this problem any more on the Nexus. Of note, however, the Nexus updated itself to Kitkat 4.4.4 so maybe it is fixed.  Interestingly, the Samsung says it's \"up to date\" at 4.4.2.\n4. The Nexus just seems to be faster.  Facebook and everything else open faster.\n\nThe Nexus is slightly longer (vertically) than the Tab.  Originally I was concerned as I wanted my tablet to fit easily in my purse.  The difference in size may actually be an advantage, as there is more room to \"hold\" the Nexus v the Tab.\n\nIf there is a disadvantage to the Nexus, it is that it does not have expandable memory (i.e. slot for mini sd card).  So if you want 32G and don't want to pay for a more expensive Nexus, this Tab would probably be the cheaper route.\n\nHope this is helpful to anyone trying to decide between the two."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I received the Galaxy Tab 4 for a Birthday present and spent a week putting it through the trials of normal tablet uses, and after I week I'm a little disappointed.\n\nFirst of I just want to say I am impressed with the interface Samsung developed for the galaxy brand of devices, but the amount of preinstalled apps (Crap-ware) that bog down the device is a little annoying. Which brings me to performance, the device was very laggy with all the stuff that was competing for memory, which is only 1.5gb. Just normal navigation is annoying, when compared to even a 3 year old iPad. When browsing the web, the screen sometimes freezes for a few seconds, then rushes to catch up be performing all those inputs you mashed trying to get the system to respond.\n\nAlso the wifi, it would cut out for no reason, requiring me to turn off the wifi then turn it back on to get it to work again, and no its not my router.\n\nOverall I would not recommend the Galaxy Tab 4, anybody who needs a 7in tablet so spring for a older model Kindle Fire HD or spend the extra money to get a Nexus 7 or Kindle Fire HDX."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00J8DL78O", "review": "I bought this tablet at my local Target store on the 30th of June and let me say, this is the best tablet I ever had. It's super light and easy to use. The front and back camera are great to take selfies and pictures and it's great for taking videos. The Skype is great as well. I am a teenager myself and I am using it for school and personal stuff. I use the Google Chrome for web browsing and it's really fast. Downloading apps is fast as well as opening and running them. I have downloaded the CM Security from the Google Play Store for free and I run it once a day and it always says it's safe. I also downloaded the CleanMaster app and clean it after I'm done using it and it helps deletes the junk files and makes the device run even faster.\n\nA couple of my relatives have both the iPad and the iPad Mini, but when I tried both of them myself, nothing compares to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4. The iPad Mini is a little bigger than this and a little lighter, but from what I experienced, the Samsung is better and it saved me $200-400.\n\nThe reading is great and I mostly download my books straight from Google Play Books and the Amazon Kindle Store. The Wattpad app (YouTube for E-books) is an awesome app for downloading free books written by teens and tranditional/self-published authors. The keyboard is great when it comes to commenting on the works and also typing my own stories.\n\nThe battery lasts much longer, too. I had mine at 100% charged and it lasted for about twelve hours of playing time (with the brightness turned to low). I have the Netflix app and I can watch the videos perfectly. It's crystal clear.\n\nListening to music is much more clear and easier when you put some ear buds on. The speaker is on the back of the device.\n\nOverall, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 is a perfection! You should buy it!"}

Needed email, contacts, documents and other material for work I could carry around without needing 10 inches or more of tablet. No trouble adding apps from Samsung and Google Play. The things that ultimately drew me to this tablet were, size, price and micro SD slot. I know the cloud is fine, but I have been in business meetings and needed some information and couldn't get it from the laptop due to poor connection. Absolutely need an SD card or flash drive and can't take the chance my needed information is out on an inaccessible cloud. Next was size and reading something like a spreadsheet is painful on a postage stamp screen. Did not want a big tablet, I have one of those and love it for different reasons, and 7 inches is just right. Using it steadily for several days, adding apps and exploring functions. The only downside was registering the product. You need the number off the box because the number on the back of the unit is only half the number they want. To get the MAC address I accessed my router to get the information. My router has all the MAC addresses. Couldn't find the numbers from the System Menu inside the unit. Other than that, everything else is good."}

I also want to say that prior to retirement, I spent 15 years in the I.T. dept. of a large company.  My wife and I looked at smart phones, and particularly, at prices of bundled family plans with smart phones.  We were very disappointed at how much more money we were going to have to pay to upgrade from a flip phones bundle to a smart phone bundle.  We were put off by having to buy internet packages twice a month - one for home and one for phones (with a capped limit).  I also questioned my friends, and discovered that all of them rarely use their phone internet, but always try to wait until they get to a free wi-fi zone to surf.  For these reasons, we went with a tablet for travel purposes - a one time purchase - with no monthly bill.  This is not a review to say that Samsung has the best one.  But, it had all the features we needed at a price I was comfortable with.  We love this tab."}

Do you know how much the Galaxy Note 8 is worth now? Less than $149.99, in just about a year. Do you know how much the iPad mini (1st generation) is worth now after more than a year? $270. That's what I mean. Is not worth buying these Samsung tablets. If you are new to the market and want to try I would highly recommend you to buy these tablets after 6 months they are released so you get a good deal (because by that time samsung would have released 3 new models) or I would recommend buying it but sell it before is too late (what I did with the Note 8)."}

I use it for some games, ebooks, streaming videos, web browsing, music, internet radio etc. I really like using the split screen with two apps opened at the same time.\nThe Galaxy Tab 4 7\" has nice resolution at 1280x800 and was very pleased with the display.  I had a Google Nexus 7 and on paper had better specs, however in real world use it was very hard to distinguish the speed with which the Galaxy executes its tasks. It is a plastic build and feels well built. I did not find it creaky or flimsy. I think it is a great deal at $180.00. I added a 32gb micro sd card and have 40 mb total memory. I also find the Touchwiz interface very user friendly. This tablet does not have the fastest processor (although it is a Quadcore) or highest resolution, or a metal chassis, but for someone who does not mind plastic & is not  a pixel peeper & doesn't need a 2.4mhz processor this tablet does a great job in \"real time everyday usage\" & you really won't find it lacking in performance."}

So I'm happy with it.\nHonestly turning an ebook page for 4 secs is pretty damn fast. If it took 3 minutes then I would understand why people gripe about the processor speed.\nThe touch screen is quite responsive even with a screen protector on.\nWiFi is good. My kitchen is on the first floor at the back. My router is in my room on the 2nd floor witch is at the front. From that distance this device can pick up the signal. It can also pick up signals from my neighbors houses. The only time i notice any lag is if a page or video is poorly coded.\nSound is good but even better with head phones.\nThe battery life is good but you can squeeze more juice out if you tone down the screen brightness. And adjust the other settings.\nIt has a micro SD slot. Totally trumps the iPad there.\nIt's very light weight. Thin too.\nHas a very clean UI. Not crowded and confusing.\nThe device and charger do not heat up.\nIt syncs very well with my online accounts.\nGPS on this tablet is fairly accurate. I live in St. Louis and GPS doesn't always work well due to street renames, buildings sitting behind another one and such.\nControls are responsive, it will only take a feather light touch.\nI can't speak about Bluetooth connection and the IR blaster because I have no comparable devices to test them  with. Edit\nJuly 2,2014 lol I forgot my cell has blue tooth capabilities. This tab was able to connect to my Samsung Galaxy Y (Hello Kitty edition).\n\nCons. The cameras could have been better. Only 3 mega pixels for the back and 1 for the front. Come on Samsung at least give us 5 mega pixels! Colors look a bit saturated even in bight light. It's just OK enough to use the outer camera as a QR scanner just don't expect much."}

Some companies would rather not include one and then charge you an extra $100 for 16 additional GB's of storage -- that is basically a slap in the face when you can get 64GB sd cards for less than $50.\n\nThe one thing this tablet is missing is an LED notification light!  Not having one is a huge disappointment.  On most android phones you get a small LED that will flash a certain color when you have notifications, but on this tablet I constantly have to pick it up and turn it on to see if I missed any notifications when I stepped away from my desk."}

I have the wifi version and it has Android 4.4.2 which isn't supported by more and more apps. Additionally, this version of Android makes it impossible to fully utilize the nice new SD card I bought for it. It's also loaded with bloatware so I have to manually free up space on it. It's basically been an ebook reader.\n\nI regret this purchase and do not recommend this tablet."}

So far my husband is very pleased with this tablet and it is fine for his purposes of streaming baseball games, playing games, and reading books."}
