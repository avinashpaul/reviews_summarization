HP has just released this new 7 inch tablet that runs the full version of Windows 8.1.\n\nBuild quality for the price is surprisingly good. HP managed to get a 7 inch IPS display built into the tablet and it feels solid overall.\n\nPerformance is actually pretty decent. It has a quad core Intel Atom processor that delivers about the same performance as other Atom based PCs. It is hindered by only having one gigabyte of memory, so there will be a limit to how much multitasking the machine can handle without slowing down.\n\nWhen running one application at time the machine feels as good as some of the inexpensive Atom based laptops I've looked at recently. Gaming performance is lacking for modern games (mostly due to the small amount of available RAM) but older games and casual mobile games should work fine.\n\nThe Stream 7 lacks an external video port, so it's not easy to use the tablet on a larger display. It is possible to transmit the display wirelessly to a Miracast device, but the output has a lot of latency and it won't go beyond its native 1280x800 resolution. The charging port is OTG compatible, so it might be possible to use a USB video device with it.\n\nYes it has limitations - both in its available memory and external display capabilities. But Compare this to any other $99 tablet out there and it's exceptionally good - especially given how well it runs the full version of Windows 8.1\n\nDISCLOSURE - I purchased this tablet with my own funds"}

The keyboards keys kept falling out, and didn't work. The free limited internet was thru T-Mobile, and because of poor coverage, was useless. The product has several limitations. They were completely useless. HP will not tell me how to reset them, so they are nothing more than bookends, at least if I could reset them I could donate or sell them."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "Positive(s) - it's priced right. Screen res is pretty nice for a cheap device. That's all I can think of.\nNegatives - about half the time it starts it doesn't connect to WiFi or Bluetooth. Restart usually fixes but often I've completed work before I notice it's not connecting and now I have to save it to the tablet instead of my server, restart, go back and find and now do the simple operation I wanted to do 10 minutes ago. HP has an update to their network drivers which took this problem from a solid one to an intermittent one.\nIt continues to use battery full steam when it goes to sleep. I have to make certain I shut it down completely or I'm guaranteed to have a dead battery a few hours later.\nIt often claims to be charging when it is is not. Example last night I plugged it in at 48% confirmed I shut down, unplugged it when I left the house and at 9AM tried to use and found 1% battery. Now I've wasted half an hour trying to charge and I still can't use it."}

However its sad that HP the manufacture was not able to assist me with my technical issue. It took me  over two weeks to determine how to fix the issue, but Im fortunate in that I had some technical knowledge from my past that allowed me the patience to understand what was needed to be done in order to resolve my issue finally!\n\n I had to literally remove the back of the device and take out the Sim card and then re-configure the Sim card as well as do some configuration to the Sim card so that the system would  keep a longer charge without dying after 30 minutes to an hour. I learned all this by watching YouTube as well as some technical sites via Google.\n\nWhen Iv first got this product it worked well until the last several months. I have attempted to research fixes online ND CALLED HP a couple of times with no success. I'm suck with a device that no longer keeps a charge."}

Not a ton of data but fine for checking email on the go.

Windows 10 caused awful issues, and you don't necessarily get to roll back. I ended up using a spare windows 8 key I had and reinstalling from scratch, which needless to say, is an issue that should not have been there. It has gotten very slow. This may be related to not installing all the windows updates because I don't want windows 10, and they're sneaking it in wherever they can now. I highly recommend GWX Control Panel if you want to keep this on Windows 8 like it came with.\nI keep it with as little as possible on it or help with the slowness. Again, it's not terrible, it's just not great. The wifi issue is definitely a problem. I regularly turn it off and on and reboot to get my connection back. However, it is nice to have desktop programs; it would just be nice if Windows 8 development was still a priority.\nIf you're after something for basic Web browsing and kindle reading and the occasional minor editing of documents, this will do fine, but you may be as well off/better off with an inexpensive android tablet that will have more useful functionality made for a touch device."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "This is perhaps one of my most disappointing purchases in the last several years.  This tablet failed to live up to expectations for several reasons:\n\n1) Poor wifi connectivity: although I have used the device with a number of different access points while owning it, it's clear that the connectivity issues are specific to the device.  If the tablet goes to sleep, upon waking, you have to disable and re-enable wifi on the device before it will reconnect.  Sometimes this is insufficient.  It has got to the point that it's frankly just easier to reboot the darn thing every time you want to use it.\n\n2) Poor customer support from HP: I reached out to HP about the wifi issues with the device and they provided very little help... they helped me to reinstall the driver for the wifi (which I had already done, twice, and told them as much) and otherwise showed no real interest in helping. they seem to have relegated support to owners trying to help each other out on their support site.\n\n3) Computing power too limited: Simply put, the device is underpowered.  Yes, it was a cheap device, but it runs applications so slowly that you're going to regret the purchase at the price point.  For instance, the mail and calendar application from Microsoft repeatedly crashes during use.  If you are looking at a weather map you find that it takes a long time for any weather animations to make progress.\n\n4) Poor battery life: I blame both the tablet itself and Windows for this.  The Windows power options are not well configured to encourage battery life on devices with small capacity batteries because it's difficult to set sleep and hibernation states.  Unlike other phones and tablets I have owned Windows does not seem to allow for wifi to run properly to keep getting things like email updates when the device is sleeping (without significant battery drain).  It's possible that this problem is related to the wifi problems I encounter with this device, but none-the-less, other devices manage battery much better.  The number of times at the outset I grabbed the tablet after a few hours to do something only to find that the battery level was critical so the device would not power on was incredible.\n\nI had hoped that the Windows 10 update would help to improve this device, but alas it hasn't helped with most of these issues.  Indeed, installing it was an ordeal because of the wifi connectivity problems... ultimately I had to resort to using a USB adapter to plug a USB key into the device after loading windows onto it from another computer.\n\nOverall I am extremely disappointed in this device -- it has caused nothing but frustration for me.  On a recent trip I literally said to my wife \"I should throw this thing into the hot-tub so I won't feel so guilty about getting rid of it.\"  Save your money and get something else."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "Initial Impressions:\n\nI have had this tablet now for several months.  There are things I love about it and things I hate about it.  Prior to switching to a Windows tablet, I was using an Android tablet (a Kindle with a CM Rom, if that means anything to you).  I switched to a Windows tablet because I liked the idea of having a full Windows OS at my disposal.  Along the way I have encountered several pros and cons from taking such an approach.\n\nFirst  the tablet comes with Windows 8.1, but is easily upgradeable to Windows 10.  A few drivers need to be updated, but they're relatively easy to come by.  Whether you run it with Windows 10 or Windows 8.1, youll need driver updates right away  most notably the Wifi driver and the video driver, which are problematic out of the box.\n\nThere is a lot of flex on the back cover, due to a significant amount of space between the non-removable battery and SD-Card slot and the removable cover.  This makes the device thicker than necessary, as well as contributes to a flimsy feel.\n\nHaving a full Windows tablet is nice  in theory.  It does run 32bit apps very well, and having a full Office installation at your disposal is very nice.  However, the screen is really too small for any real productivity, and a full-sized keyboard and mouse are needed if you plan to make use of the office applications.  The on-screen keyboard is absolutely terrible on Windows, with no swype-style options available.  Its 100 percent hunt and peck.\n\nThe Windows app store is also terrible.  Theyre *very* slowly adding apps, but there are not nearly enough to give Windows any kind of edge over Android.  (This is coming from a Windows fan, by the way).\n\nThe price is good, but again, doesnt hold any benefits over a decent Android tablet.  Overall, if I was to purchase again, I would definitely go with Android.\n\nOne plus is that no third party software or bloatware is included on the tablet.  Probably because the hard drive would be completely full if it was.\n\nNow for the technical impressions:\n\nThe quad-core 32 bit Bay Trail processor is very nice.  It is capable of running Windows 8.1 or 10 very smoothly.  Unfortunately, the RAM is far too low for any kind of multitasking or any heavy program.  Even the app store restricts apps from this tablet due to having only 1GB of available RAM.  Webpages load slowly, programs crash, etc., as a result of the lower RAM.\n\nA 7 screen is good for most tablets, but if you're using Windows 10 outside of Tablet mode, serious resolution modifications are needed in order to make the screen usable.  Font sizes need to be increased, for example.  The screen resolution (1200 x 800) is also weak.  It is acceptably bright for indoor use, but weak for outdoor use.  Black levels are horrible, severely lacking compared to other similarly priced tablets.  Likewise, and unsurprisingly, contrast is also terrible in comparison to other similarly priced tablets.  If image quality is a priority, this is not the tablet for you.  But honestly, that was probably a given by the resolution alone.\n\n32GB of storage is far too small, also.  About half of that is usable, and fills very quickly.  Initially, apps could not be installed on the SD card, but this has very recently changed.\n\nBattery life is acceptable, at about 4 hours (with low brightness and settings, it can be stretched to 5)  but this could definitely be better, too, as other tablets of this size and weight stretch to 6 or 8 hours.  Charge time is just over 2 hours from 0% to 100%.\n\nThe Windows 10 update is definitely worthwhile.  It adds tablet functions that are valuable (although sometimes admittedly glitchy), and the OS runs more smoothly than Windows 8.1\n\nBoth front and rear cameras are a joke.  I don't know why theyd even bother to put a 2MP rear camera on the device, and the 0.3MP camera on the front is barely Skype-worthy.  Neither camera has any kind of auto-focus, and I suspect that the rear camera is probably the same kind that would normally be used on the front of a higher end phone ore tablet.\n\nClosing thoughts:\n\nOffice is now available on Android.  Cheaper, higher-end Android tablets are readily available.  In my opinion, unless you have something that absolutely needs to be able to run x86 apps, avoid Windows tablets.  Windows on a tablet has far more cons than pros.\n\nFor this tablet specifically:  For $100, you're getting something function, but not something great.  Its a good tablet if your expectations are low, but otherwise, it is just not worth it.  There are much better options out there.  If I had it to do over again, I would buy a previous model, discounted Nexus 7.  I think Id be a lot happier with it than I am with this device."}

If you're trying to use your included Office 365 subscription with it, I'd suggest you not bother moving to 10. The subscription includes 1TB of storage. That's 1024GB of data. The tablet has 32GB of data. On Windows 8.1, OneDrive files are on OneDrive, but can be made available offline, and appear in all file selection dialogs. On Windows 10, OneDrive files are synced to the device. That means the files on OneDrive have to also be on the tiny 32GB of storage on the tablet for them to be accessible to applications. This changes 32GB of storage from practical to impractical."}

The not so good - 1) sporadically drops wireless internet connection. The connection does not show as dropped immediately, but later will show dropped or \"limited\". I've learned to just disconnect and reconnect when it stops responding.  Running other devices on my wireless network and don't experience this problem with the other devices. 2) I also bought a Bluetooth keyboard to use with the Stream 8.  The keyboard would also lose connectivity. To pair back up you needed to enter a code on the keyboard.  However, the tablet stopped displaying what code to enter so I could not establish the connection.  Finally gave up and started using the virtual keyboard which blocks out a major portion of the display when you type. 3) The battery doesn't last very long when the tablet isn't plugged in. 4) Some websites are very difficult to navigate with this screen touch tablet - drop down menus don't hold, checking multiple boxes doesn't work, etc."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "The device runs quickly and the biggest benefit (from a quick usage standpoint) is that you can find programs you know/recognize from your PC. Also it feels nice and light, with a \"home button\" for the desktop on the edge of the device. There is a charging slot and a microphone input on the top, next to one another-fairly convenient.\nThe biggest fault I find with this is Microsoft's need to have you sync with their Microsoft system. Since its not android, there is no google anywhere. Microsoft has their own versions of the things you may use google for. And they do not work (at least for me thus far) in parallel. A \"onelive\" ID, associated with your hotmail/outlook account drives documents and saving mechanisms/locations. This can be quite painstaking if you don't have these (which you can easily create) or are heavily dependent on other platforms (such as android). I've had to re-sign in, send re-authorizations codes, etc to the point of having to use Microsoft's items. Good or for bad."}

My tablet is now working just as good as it did with Windows 8.1. So, my advice is that if you upgrade to Win10, just visit support.hp.com after your install and get the latest drivers for the system.\n\nFirst off, I love this tablet (or at least I used to). I bought mine from the MS store as a Signature Edition Windows 8.1 with Bing machine. Basically this means that it was just like any HP Stream 7 except that it did not have all of the typical HP bloatware installed on it, just a clean install of Windows.\n\nNow, here is the reason that I basically can't stand using this tablet any longer. I took advantage of my free upgrade to Windows 10 and it was a huge mistake as I can't roll back to 8.1 since I deleted my recovery partition to save space. Now, the Windows key on the bezel no longer works at all and the accelerometer no longer auto rotates the screen. Any time I want to change screen orientation I have to do it in the display settings menu, which is a huge pain. The only way to call up the start menu is by hitting the start key on the taskbar. Not to mention that Windows 10 just isn't very touch friendly (or at least not as touch friendly as Windows 8.1 was).\n\nAll this aside, the tablet is a surprisingly good device, especially at its low price point (I got mine for $69 from Microsoft). The flaws that I mentioned above are a result of installing Windows 10 on it and no fault of the tablet itself, so it still gets a 5 star rating from me."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I have had this tablet for less than a year and is dead. I used it for basic things like checking email and surfing the web when I didn't want to use my laptop. This thing was great when I had it for the first three months, after that is when I started to have problems. Sometimes when I would open my browser it would go into full screen and there was no way I could use it without a keyboard, I know this may seem like a minor convenience for some but you have to understand that you can't type anything on you tablet because there is no way to access the digital keyboard. Another problem I had was random freezes and it would shutdown. I thought it was the battery but I couldn't check because the battery is permanently fixed to the tablet. I also need to mention that the battery gets pretty hot and it gets pretty uncomfortable when you have it on your lap. The tablet is a great idea and it did work for basic tasks, but I would pay a bit more for something that would actually last. I don't recommend this tablet because it does glitch quite a bit, but if you want something that will last a few months then feel free to get it. This is just my experience, yours may vary."}

For starters I am an Apple guy at heart, but at work many of my people running Windows, Android, etc, and truth be known, different OS(s) show different views of different software/bowser/user experiences. As a go to technical person I work within every OS computer/mobile platforms. As a life choice, I carry around my laptop as little as possible (I don't need to anymore). Between an iPhone 6s +, the HP 7 Stream and LG V410 I am able to view my work from all Apple, Microsoft, and Android user perspectives at all times in all places from dedicated devices. I am a believer that in todays high tech world, high tech work needs to be mobile all the time, but not at the expense of always being the guy with the backpack. The HP Steam 7 is small enough to carry around, stash in a glove compartment, ask you girlfriend to nicely store in her purse while your out but on call, and yet big enough to still be effective using Cloud/Browser based tools. When I am on airplanes I use the HP to read Kindle when my phone or other tablet die. Also, I have this thing Running Windows 10 like a champ. This is a great solution to work well, stay mobile, and not carry a laptop around. Note, this is not a Cellular enabled device.

The tablets performance was pretty much would you would expect from a budget Windows tablet--it could easily handle basic tasks like web browsing and some light document editing, but beyond that, the tablet proved sluggish. The screen on the device is certainly not near that of an iPad, but is good enough to tolerate for some web browsing, watching videos, and even creating documents.\n\nThe free 4G is great--although it is limited and I frequently had trouble getting a signal in place where I had a strong Verizon signal. A great back-up, but it is not a great reason to purchase this tablet.\n\nMy biggest gripe about the tablet is the headphone jack. I went back and forth (and through 3 replacement units) with HP over the headphone jack. There is a tremendous amount of interference that can be heard whenever using headphones (it is reduced somewhat however if you use low-frequency headphones). As a constant traveler, I found this issue to be highly annoying. With that being said, if you can overlook the headphone issue, this is a solid entry-level Windows tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I cried a little bit when manufacturers stopped producing Palmtops, the tiny little laptop-ish sort of affairs that used to be pretty commonplace among nerds and business travelers before laptops were cheap or light, and before your cellphone was also your email platform. I've searched far and wide for something that suited my delicate, lady-like fingers and my penchant for getting stuff done on long commutes without carrying a 10lb bag. I scoffed at tablets like the ipad which were so gimped all I ever saw a businessman do with one is play candy crush or some other embarrassing minigame on the ferry to work. I own the Stream 11, which is HP's super cheap ultralight chromebooky thing. It's great, but carrying whatever book I was reading was getting old, so I started looking at eReaders.\n\nI was about 2 clicks from owning the new $50 kindle, until I saw this in the suggestions. I'd previously brushed it off as 'just another tablet', but then I did some thinking. Win10 has the Kindle app, a full office suite, a big-boy browser that will let me install adblock, and most importantly, a full Windows install that can run the Citrix app I need to connect to my office PC. Now for 90% of my commutes I can ditch both the book I would normally carry, and the HP netbook. People are quick to tell me I can't possibly get any work done on a 7\" screen with a 7\" keyboard case, but it's surprisingly effective. The fact that its a very dense (BRIGHT!) IPS means even small text in my terminal windows is easy to read.\n\nPeople have rated the Kindle app for win10 poorly, but it does do the basics pretty well and I've been enjoying it in spite of the insanely nitpicky things people seem to complain about. In a pinch, I can fire up a full-on, native SSH client or my Citrix gateway and get some work done right away. In terms of performance, it's not going to break records, but I routinely have a web browser, the kindle app, and SSH going simultaneously and rarely hit any choppiness. On my first boot I was prompted for a win10 upgrade which I gleefully took, because Win10 is a major step forward. I didn't even realize all of the gesture controls at first, which make it an amazingly fluid experience. The downside is that a Win10 tablet has all of the desktop programs you love, but fewer of the 'App store' apps you need. An iPad/Android tab is the exact opposite. More often than not I'm more frustrated by having to use a gimped iOS version of my favorite program than not being able to find a certain mobile app, since most mobile apps generally prove to be crap.\n\nThe build quality isn't too bad, considering you can score one for $99, it's as well built as any average Windows laptop you'd buy. Apple is in a league of its own for build quality, so no, don't expect a unibody aluminum masterpiece with chamfered bezels for 1/6th the price. If I drop it off a subway platform, it might ruin about 2 hours out of my day before I got over it. When it's obsolete in a few years, I won't be mad at all. Enjoy paying as much as this thing costs for your applecare plan!"}

But it is a bit annoying.\nSept 15, 2015  - still under warranty, and after about 2 hours dealing with technician on Chat Help, he was unable to help with the failure of the battery to  hold a charge. He suggested that the whole unit be replaced, but that required approval of his supervisor. Supervisor asked all same questions, and after another hour told me that they would send out a NEW unit. Scheduled to arrive in two days. If it is any better, I will post a note about it. A bit wearying, but I assume that they have to do it \"by the book\". Can't imagine how they make any money on this device if this happens very ofte. But it does speak well of HP's willingness to provide customer service. I'll leave it with the same 3 stars for the moment.\nDecember 6, 2016 - After receiving the \"new replacement\", which was likely a refurbished model containing only the tablet, no cable or transformer, I repeatedly charged the unit. It usually failed to even hold a charge. The USB connector felt a bit wobbly, and may be defective. I will try one more time to contact the HP service department. It has been sitting unuseable on the shelf. I may have had the bad luck of suffering two  units with defective power systems, but I consider this a total waste of money.\nHJ Karten"}

Crazy that it's only $150 for the tablet itself. I got an SD card, USB OTG cable, screen protector, a keyboard/cover, and a mouse to set it up as a laptop replacement and still came in well under $250 easily. One thing it could certainly use, a second GB of RAM. That does become a drawback when opening too many internet tabs, or trying to run some programs, especially games. Team Fortress 2, Civilization 5 (in DX9 mode), and the original Guild Wars have all run well. It choked a bit on League of Legends, down to 7-10 FPS most times and occasionally worse. Hung up entirely on Rocksmith. Some small indie games with really fast pace, 2d stuff that normally are not resource hogs, couldn't quite keep up either at times. The screen can be quite bright and vivid to the point of working well enough outdoors and has really good viewing angles, just some light bleed obvious on a black screen. Do turn off your cellular internet when not actively using it, if you stick with the Tmobile plan. That 200 MB goes in a hurry, even just watching a single Youtube video or background syncing of programs. Planning to migrate it over to Windows 10 soon, as online sources I've seen say it does work about as well as 8.1 with this tablet, just drivers can be an issue on a clean install."}

They are ages 11 through 19 and are very tech savvy so we can't blame this on the recipients being too young to know what they're doing.

I ordered the HP stream 8 with a microsd slot, and free 4G (but only 200mb a month). The tablet also comes with a full year of 365. On the plus side a full version of windows 8 is installed on the tablet which upgraded to windows 10 through windows update.  So far I am amazed with the adobe pdf reader and microsoft edge(aka internet explorer). On the downside this tablet apparently comes with 1 GB of ram. You do have to be very careful not to open up more than 2-3 applications or internet tabs at once because if you so the system may lag. If you want something that can handle heavier applications perhaps you should consider paying $100-200 more. I would not purchase it at the current price of $180(I paid under $150 for a new one w4G), but if you can get a deal on this tablet I would go for it."}

Real \"computer work\" (for me, writing emails), is horrible with their excuse of a \"keyboard\", so I'm grateful my friends also gave me an external Bluetooth keyboard; better, but still hard to use. If I ever choose to get a tablet myself, it will only be for games or photos; this thing's more inconvenient than anything.  So, in case you think I view tablet computers are horrible--you're RIGHT.\n\nNow the GOOD news, which is only on HP itself.  8 months into the warranty, I got an ad pretending to be a virus & stopping all internet function. Their customer service gladly tried removing it, but the whole machine died while they were working on it, so immediately saw they had to send me a new one:).  2 days after getting it, they called to ask how it was working; when I said 'not as responsive', they immediately worked to correct that, but said 'sorry, we can't do anything, we'll send you a new one (TABLET #3)--I hadn't even asked them to do that, but hooray for them!\n\nMy only reason for still liking HP somewhat is their printers(have had 10+, most of which I've WORN OUT) + my last Wonderful XP desktop machine.

I never had dead on arrival and thought , ok first time....\nI choose to call HP warranty instead of the online shop , I thought that I can trust HP better. It wasn't simple to get to the right person but after I did and she checked all the routine checks with me she told me she will send me a replacement unit.  After about 5 days the new replacement with no charger arrives, I pressed the on button , hp logo shows  than blue screen some massage about administrator than a screen that pop for a sec and shom loading file restart and than a massage boot device not found. After that I could not  replicate the hp logo etc, all I could get was the boot device not found screen...\nCall hp again, got to the right person , checks again and they are sending another replacement unit. about 5 days later the new tablet arrives\nand I charge, press the on button and again the same thing???\nCalled HP again waited to get to the right person , they offer to arrange a refund from the online shop but since I ordered from Amazon a case and screen protector and already received it , (Thanks Amazon!) I ask for another replacement and I asked them, Please , could someone check that it works before they send it this time?\nReceived it yesterday and it did the same thing...  I have 4 faulty Stream 7 tablets now at home!!!\nThis time I took a video with my phone from the first on press the hp logo until the boot device not found.\nI called the shop, I gave up on HP and I can't understand how 4 units are faulty? I can't find any thing about it on google so I don't believe the stream 7 is sooo bad but I can't explain it and by the end of the day, I paid for a new Steam 7 tablets and have now 4 faulty ones at home and I even didn't manage to see this tablet works properly for 1 second..."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I bought this tablet (and wanted to keep) but became concerned about some performance issues.  I purchased via the Microsoft online store.  Return within 30day return period was relatively pain free\n\nPros\n\nAt $149 ($30 cheaper than HP) for a real computer a decent buy.\n\n1. Much smaller and lighter than a laptop for travelling.\n2. Leverage the T-Mobile capability when Wifi was unavailable.\n3. Load a few apps and games.\n4. A real computer with a file manager, micro USB for file transfer.\n5. A cheap guinea pig device to upgrade to free Win 10 and try it out to reduce aggravation before I jump in with both feet to upgrade my laptop.\n6.  Maybe stream shows or display tablet screen to my TV.\n7.  32GB storage expandable to 64GB via micro SD.\n\nCons\n\n1. Weak Wi-Fi reception  which was an annoyance. I would have had to buy a Wi-Fi range extender whereas no other devices I own have any problem with Wi-Fi reception in same location.\n\n2. Tablet sometimes froze while trying to stream video wirelessly to TV using Microsoft Wireless display adapter.\n\n3. Not sure why but if I was logged on as one standard user, turned off all radios (Wi-Fi, Cellular), shut down, rebooted and  tried to logon as a different standard user the Stream would return a message Device is offline, logon as prior user message.\n\n4. Tablet is not MHL capable (MHL micro usb/HDMI cable to TV would not work).  I contacted HP before purchase.  First HP support rep said it was MHL capable.  I ordered MHL cable after placing tablet order.  Found out from second HP support rep Stream 8 is Not MHL capable.\n\n5. MS App Store Implementation - Microsofts app store implementation is dumb (I am not talking about number of apps available).  In order to download apps you must have a Microsoft account locally installed on the Stream 8.  So when you are using apps you are logged on to app store (unless app can be used with Wi-Fi and Cellular turned off).  This is idiotic.  If you want to install an app you should merely be able to login to app store, download app, and log out.  Also  app is available for only the MS account on Stream 8 it was downloaded to and cannot be shared with any other user accounts on device.  I found out after the fact customers have complained about this MS app store implementation in forums for several years.\n\n6. Cant use 32GB Micro SD storage to store apps or store downloaded maps for a map app such as HERE maps.\n\n7.  OS  Microsoft Answer Desk - I was somewhat disappointed in Microsoft Answer Desk (they were ok if Windows 8.1 questions did not go beyond their script) but get beyond their scope and it was Well have to get you to paid support.  It was interesting when they sent follow up emails regarding a question discussed in a chat with a link to the answer desk indicating if I wanted to discuss the issue again with the same support rep just click on the link, but in reality it was impossible to reach the same support rep to discuss instructions the rep had previously provided."}

However, for real life use, this device is one of those \"you get what you pay for\". I believe most users will get a better value by spending a little bit more for an android device in the 100-200 range.\nHere are the major limitations that makes these device barely usable:\n- Battery anxiety because of short battery life of 4 to 6 hours, this is assuming you are conscious of the apps you are using. You have to make sure you recharge before leaving the house and limit its use when traveling by airplane/train/bus etc.\n- Small amount of apps and its unsure how many apps will be develop in the future with MS divesting their mobile nokia division\n- Web browser runs in full window mode hence it is also running the full cpu/battery intensive ads\n- Buttons and menus are too small to be finger touch.\n- Unexplain battery drain. Rumor drain caused by wifi left on (workaround is to go into airplane mode or shutdown) and sound driver (have to mute or shutdown)\n- Unexplain crashes\n\nI thought my needs were pretty low and i could do with the limitations, but in reality my time/life is worth more than saving a few bucks having to constantly workaround this device's limitation. Unless you just want the 364 office subscription and see this device as an bonus (something that will typically just be left on the coffee/kitchen/nightstand table), avoid."}

Sound is OK for the size unit.\nI also have an Apple ipad mini I got for $200. It's pricey, but bigger screen than the HP. At 7.9\" , the screen is just big enough for finger use--probably by design.

But the only other resolution on offer is 1024 x 768 which leaves 2 huge blank areas on either side of the landscape view.  Perhaps an OS update from Microsoft or a driver update from HP could fix this by giving more resolution options. As I am using it as a console for a control system that just needs to boot up and display a web browser with several pages in tabs, it is ideal.

No problem.  Also, unlike some other tablets I have, this one has an audio profile for the bluetooth so I don't need a dongle to listen to music on my headphones on the tablet.  :)  Connection is decent enough on cellular and Wifi isn't too bad either.  I got this for $100 and it's well worth it to me.  :)  Replaced a $50 tablet I got on sale and I'm looking to install Windows 10 on it when that comes out.... hopefully it will let me..... people are saying that it does.... only gripe I have is that the Office365 subscription promotion they offered with it expired on mine.... but I already have a free subscription to that for another 5 months anyway, so it's not a total loss.\n\nEDIT:  I just installed the latest build of Windows 10 as of this writing (build 10162) and everything's working very well.  No real issues with the touchscreen, performance, etc.  I first tried with 10130 and had some issues, but 10162 is fairly solid.  Just install the x86 version since you only have 1GB of RAM."}

But I use Office 365 heavily for both business and personal stuff so it makes sense for me. I have been able to find apps for everything I need except a really good turn by turn GPS app*.  You won't find mobile apps for your bank or credit cards, etc but I prefer full site web so this isn't an issue for me.  There is a great app for bookmarks and I found it works out better for me than an Android mobile app.\n\nI really like the display of text on this device and working with Office 365 is a breeze.  When I do heavy duty work, I hook it up to an HDMI adapter to my TV and use an OTG cable to hook in my wireless mouse and keyboard.  I use MS OneDrive and an external hard drive for storage so it replaces my laptop for most things that I do (although I can't imagine doing major photo editing on this).  One of my favorite things is the ability to split the screen between apps.  This is quite handy and saves me a lot of time when I am working.\n\nA note on the 1 year free Office 365 -- I had an existing subscription and it was only extended 9 months not 1 year.  Microsoft claims that it is HP's issue but I find that hard to believe.  This is kind of disappointing since the savings on my existing Office subscription was part of the justification for the purchase.\n\nI had an issue with the 1st unit I received.  After a couple of days the speakers became raspy and the network adapter kept turning off. I can't say enough good things about HP customer service.  There was no hassle receiving a replacement which arrived in about 3 days and all has been well since.\n\n* I have Maps Pro loaded for GPS and I would rate it as adequate.

My main computer needs are typically met with my chromebook, but sometimes I just need a windows computer.  My last windows PC unfortunately hasn't seen a refresh in the last 10 years.  As others have mentioned this tablet's battery life leaves a bit to be desired, but I wasn't counting on it in the first place.  Lately I have been using this to play Final Fantasy XI online with a bluetooth keyboard http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Bluetooth-Multi-Device-Smartphones-920-006342/dp/B00MUTWLW4/ and I'm happy with it's performance.  I do wish I had gone for the Stream 8 with \"4G,\" though not enough to motivate me into getting one at full price.  The 4G on that model is T-Mobile's HSPA+, which some people refer to as \"3.5G\" because it's speeds aren't up to par with LTE.  It is my understanding that T-Mobile is actually preparing to phase HSPA+ coverage out so they can upgrade their LTE network so as tempting as the larger screen and the 200mb/month are, this tablet is good for half the price.  The one thing I'm not a fan of is how much fingerprints show on the screen.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I purchased this tablet from Amazon before a long trip in California just about 6 month ago. After thorough research and much consideration, I chose the Stream 8 over Winbook TW802, Acer W4 and Dell Venue 8 mainly for its design and 4g connectivity. The 200mb for life is pretty nice, but I went with a T-mobile plan for 5gbs per month since this is my primary to go computer. Purchased an otg cable and bluetooth keyboard to enhance its productivity, and it was nice until it lasted.\n\nMany reviews has already covered its hardware part, so I'm mainly going to write about my concern with the 4g part. It has been really handy when it lasted, I can have the comfort of reading my e-mails (outlook app is one of the nicest e-mail app), edit my office documents, anything Windows allows you to do essentially, wherever I want.\n\nAbout 3 month into the tablet, the mobile broadband starts acting up. Upon booting, the mobile broadband option under connection settings would disappear. Nowhere to be found. One or two restarts would make it come back, so I didn't give it too much thought.\n\n6 month down the line, my mobile broadband has disappeared entirely. Rebooted the computer 10 times, still nothing. I have not tried anything advance to fix the problem, but I believe with something built by HP should not be performing like this. I have never dropped the tablet, its always in it case and an own protective bag.\n\nFor future buyers, this has been the only frustration I've got with this tablet. The 1gb of ram is a little disappointing as the os consumes half of it constantly, but I found it acceptable."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I bought the Amazon \"Warehouse Deal\" because it was about $40 cheaper than the regular Amazon price. The site gives you a basic canned description and I bought one that just warned of a distressed box and did not mention explicitly that it was a customer return. Well the tablet arrived and the box was perfect but it was clear that the tablet inside had been returned. This proved to be a big problem.\n1) The Tablet supposedly comes with a years free Office 365. Unfortunately the product key for this is added to the Microsoft account first associated with the tablet. Since the tablet had been used this key was gone. I explained things to Microsoft who were only willing to let me subscribe to 365 normally since the tablet's free copy was gone. Since this is worth $60+ the \"Warehouse deal\" was looking less of a deal.\n2) The LTE 4G connection via T-Mobile was locked. The tablet said it was \"restricted\" and the connection did not stay up long enough to fully register with T-Mobile. I called their customer service. It seemed that although the box says that the 300Mb/Month \"free\" T-Mobile internet access is \"for the life of the tablet\" this is also a deal which is really attached to the first owner. The previous owner of the tablet had signed up and consequently the free deal was taken. However, unlike Microsoft T-Mobile technical support were able to put the device onto a new free plan. Unfortunately the problems with the LTE continued and as the wireless feature was a large part of the reason I got the Stream 8 over the Stream 7 I returned it. This being Amazon the return was very smooth and I decided I'd liked the tablet enough to throw down another $40 to get a new one.\n\nShort version: The Used product may not come with the \"Free\" Wireless and Office offered in the listing"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "Now that Microsoft finally fixed Windows 8.1 enough to be usable, I bought this Stream 7 (and added Classic Shell to get my Start and Desktop back) to replace an aging Lenovo netbook. What a difference. With its quad CPUs it boots in 10 seconds, shuts down in less than a second, and does all my Windows 7 programs including Office Pro, including my company database (a 1984 DOS program!), as well as what Windows has always done better than Android or Apple, networking and printing, without downloading foreign apps. Email, web browsing, video all work perfectly. With the Bluetooth keyboard and the leather portfolio, it can be a laptop, or be the touch tablet it is by itself, and do everything the Lenovo did, just 10 times faster. The only negative is that the single micro-USB is for both charging as well as USB devices so while you are using a USB device (like a memory stick or a wired networking adapter) you are on batteries. But it will run the entire day, while the Lenovo gave out in a few hours. One word of caution, don't use the power button to go on standby, as you do with Android, the battery will not last. Just power down normally like Windows 7 since bootup is only 10 seconds. An amazing buy for what you get. It should be $100 more!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "After reading all the positive reviews, my expectations for this tablet may have been too high. It's important to pay attention to the part where everyone says it's great FOR THE PRICE. Personally, I'm pretty disappointed. I've played with some friends' tablets including the galaxy tab and kindle fire, and was expecting something similar, but with lower quality screen, sound, and operating speed. But this tablet feels nothing like the other tablets I've used. It's basically an 8 inch Windows 8.1 computer, and is setup and operates like a computer, not like a tablet. For me it lacks that ease of use and user friendliness. The Windows 8.1 setup is annoying and frustrating, even when it's on a tablet instead of a computer. And the tablet is based on a desktop setting, which doesn't make sense to me. So for example, if you browse the internet, you'll actually do it from the desktop, not from the app for the browser of you choice (i.e. chrome). Also, the range of apps available through the windows store was very disappointing. To an Android smartphone user, I was unhappy to find that many of the apps and games I love on my phone were unavailable here.\n\nI'm trying to decide whether or not to return this tablet. The only thing stopping me is the fact that the tablet came with Microsoft Office 365, which was a major selling point for me and was a great deal. Maybe I have been unrealistic in my expectations for a tablet at this price. I guess the moral of the story is you get what you pay for!"}

And because it is not one of those crappy Android tablets!!. I know some people were complaining that the ear plug was buzzing while listening to music...it's not the device that has a problem rather the ear buds they are using are crap!!..I use full size over the ears headphones and the sound is excellent crisp clear sound. This tablet is the exact same as my 8.1 laptop. But you can't overload it with windows apps as it only has 1gb internal storage for apps and it causes it to slow down. The 32gb is great for storing music and pictures and for using the apps already installed. This is the best tablet I have ever bought by far!!"}

And because of the 1200x800 screen resolution, not all webpages will fit on the screen. Maybe Windows 10 will be an improvement. Whatever you do, DO NOT buy this item used or through Amazon Warehouse deals. Mine came WITHOUT the Office365 activation, and there was a dead pixel in the middle of the screen.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "A lot of things that has been said about that tablet.\nI just wanted to point out some aspects of my experience that are not matching the previous reviews:\n\na) Power drag on Idle: many report a high-powered drag on idle and are recommending for example to set the volume to zero and activate airplane mode in order to prevent short battery life on idle. I didn't do that and still have more than 50% battery after two full days idle. The only thing that I've done is to disable live information on all tiles of the modern desktop (which I don't really use by the way). I also have performed all the updates which appear to have included a new audio driver, so turning the volume to 0 is not necessarily any more.\n\nb) Poor headset audio: I really can't complain I am using a Sennheiser headset on it and it really delivers a gorgeous quality...\n\nc) Limitation to 125% on text size:\nOut of the box, you can only increase the text size to 125% which is still unusable for that resolution on 7 inches.\nI have finally found out a small hack to remove that limitation: change in the registry HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Control Panel/Desktop/Win8DpiScaling and set that value to \"1\".\nThen you will be able to set the text size to 150% which is the only way to get the Windows desktop halfway usable without a mouse.\n\nd) Operation beside a regular desktop: I really recommend the open source software \"Synergy\". With this free software you will be able to share seamlessly your keyboard and mouse between the screens of your desktop and your Stream 7 and even easily cut and paste between them. That is absolutely awesome! And free...\n\ne) Last, but not least: get a good headphone with a noise cancellation microphone and make yourself familiar with the dictation abilities of Windows 8. It is not like iOS or Android: the dictation software of Windows 8 works fully autonomously: you don't need an Internet connection to dictate and it does not phone \"home\" everything you are saying. You will never want to enter text manually any more...\n\nf) A small caveat: on one side it can run pretty every Windows program, on the other side the scope of Windows phone applications that run on that Tablet is pretty restricted. You need so-called \"universal apps\" to run on an Intel X86 based hardware. Those are not that common. Almost 80% of the \"modern\" applications written for Windows Phone won't run on that tablet..."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "The support from Microsoft for the 8.1 op. sys. leaves a very great deal to be desired. The device itself is serviceable, however, the screen-orientation-change feature is too sensitive, the VOLUME nearly inaudible from most sites, at 100%, and the user-friendliness, via Windows 8.1 is simply awful.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I mostly use it as an e-reader, but have also used it for basic Internet browsing (email, banking, information searches, general tomfoolery).  Have also used to to stream videos through public access points while traveling or using public transportation with relative success, and to listen to my MP3 and FLAC music library.  Sometimes though I do have to boot it up then reboot it again before the WiFi radio kicks in to gain access to public hotspots.  That can get annoying.  Mostly though I bought it because I work as a computer support technician and was being made to support Windows 8.1 without having had any first hand experience with it.  I was always able to slog through, but no one wants to be seen as slogging through their profession.  Replaced an older crappy Android tablet I had with this one and it has been well worth its purchase price.  I don't use the 3G data much (mostly just WiFi) but the 200 MB per month free data for life has come in damn handy on more than one occasion.  Quality is top notch as one would expect from HP.  The only thing better would be for HP to release a compact keyboard cover like the Surface, et. al., have.  The only keyboard cases available for this unit, either from HP directly or third party, add too much bulk and ruin the slimline aesthetics of the tablet. As it is, I am left carrying a separate Bluetooth keyboard in my computer bag which then takes up more space than I'd prefer just for those moments when a full sized keyboard is beneficial.  Still, the tablet itself is a great product, and, given this one caveat, well worth the purchase price."}

I found this and thought the reviews were the most promising for a tablet under $100. Aside from my Xbox, all my products are Apple - so this was pretty much useless syncing with them (which I knew). I mainly use this as a source for watching Hulu or Netflix when I don't want to lug my laptop around. Or for quick notes/online books, as a student.\n\nThings I hate: I find that I need to have it plugged in if I'm not using it. The battery, unplugged, will not last 24 hours. There is only a speaker on one end (but it's loud enough). If you are using an app like Pandora the sound turns off when the tablet falls asleep, so you have to keep it awake. It doesn't have a lot of apps that you're probably used to.\n\nThings I like: It's a decent size. It has important apps like Word, Netflix, Hulu, OneDrive, etc. Brightness and volume are good.

I have always doubt MS and Intel making a tablet. I was wrong!!!! I bought this via Amazon and shipped to Singapore for free as I am a prime member. This is a true computer, not tablet not mobile phone.......it is a computer in your hand. I have used Android and Apple tablets... ..... but this is one device that I think Apple and Google should be afraid of.\n\nOne advice for these window device is that we should turn off automatic updates. That's because sometime updates can take very long due to downloading and installation and somehow looks as if it hanged ........ the dot dot circle kept turning and turning. And users will have tendency to re-boot or power on-off the device. This screw up the updates and crashes the system.\n\nWhat we should do is only do the update at home when there is a stable wifi connection for downloading the update and let it finish the update process it by itself..... have some patience........"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I was a little nervous buying this due to the bad reviews online and on YouTube but I am so glad I bought it! The first bad review I read about was that there was a static noise in the headphones but mine didn't have that problem. I also read that the battery drains abnormally fast but I ran Facebook, YouTube, and two tabs on my browser and it reached 20% after six hours of non-stop use. The screen is a little small but you definitely get used to it after a while and you can always buy a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse for it. I love the fact that this tablet runs the full version of Windows and not the RT version. It runs Legacy, Teamviewer, and anything else that my laptop runs. I also heard that there weren't many accessories for it but I easily found an awesome green case for it that also has a stand in it. The 1Gb of RAM is a little small but is fine to watch HD YouTube videos on. All in all, this is a magnificent tablet and unbeatable. I would recommend this tablet to anyone!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "Very nice True windows 8.1 tablet. Light weight and quick with a responsive 8 inch touch screen with vivid color and a sharp HD picture. Some things are a bit too small for me and my thick fingers so I've paired it with a HP Bluetooth mouse which makes it more like using my Windows 8.1 laptop or desktop. The Bluetooth connectivity also allows you to pare with Bluetooth keyboards, speakers and headsets. Setup with file sharing with other windows computers on your wireless network is easy. Battery life is about the same as my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 that runs Android 4.4. Charging is a bit slow taking about 3-4 hours to Full from 25% with provided HP wall charger. Full Windows 8.1 is nice allowing installation of most Windows software unlike the early Windows RT tablets which you could only get apps via download from the Windows Store. Good sounding Stereo speakers allow for more enjoyable experience when listening to music or watching a movie. Available micro USB 2.0 port (Also used as the charging port) Allows connectivity to USB Hard Drives, CD/DVD Burner drives and other USB Accessories when using a Micro USB 2.0 Host OTG cable (that is not included but available form amazon.com) This USB/Charging port is also a weakness on this and other tablets because you can't charge the tablet and use a USB device at the same time. The included monthly 200MB of data through T-Mobile is a nice add-on for checking e-mail when away from a Wi-Fi connection. All in all for its price and features it one of the best 8 inch True Windows 8.1 Tablet deals out there without spending $400-$600"}

And I like the wireless-for-life feature.\n\nEDIT, my complaints about making connections:\n- I can connect EITHER a Bluetooth (keyboard or earphone) OR the Wi-Fi internet, but not both simultaneously.  Enabling Wi-Fi causes the bt to stop responding.\n\n- I can either charge (using a >= 2A usb supply) OR connect my USB-OTG adapter-cable which gives me access to several peripherals connected through a USB powered hub (hard-drive, mouse, etc).

But after I configured the tablet the network settings showed that there was no provider/connection.\n\nI opened the back cover and saw that the SIM card was seated correctly, but there were two connecters where the SIM card sits that were touching each other. I used a screw driver and flexed of one the connecters apart, reseated the SIM and Voila!  Other than this minor snafu I love the tablet. It is perfect for my use.

I was shocked to see what a little Atom processor could do with a gig of memory and Win 8.1 memory management. A real pc in this tiny form factor--no getting around the limitations of RT (or Galaxy or IPad). Hooks up to my home server, my OneDrive, my everything like a cakewalk and the internet is surprisingly fast. Like my Windows Phone, it's one of the few devices that can make you appreciate Internet Explorer, because the Metro version is (obviously) made for this form factor. Chrome, a great browser, says it has  a Metro mode, but not really. A lot of the limitations of Win 8 IE have been transcended in the new rev and my podcasts and YouTube and my tutorial services run immaculately. I can't say enough about this fine device. If I get two years out of it, I've got everything on the cloud (lesson learned from my deceased Surface Pro), I've received my full value, and I'd go out and get another one.

For the longest I delayed upgrading from an outdated Android due to various reasons, mainly being I wanted a solution that would last and far exceed any Android and iPad in what it offers.\n\n Finally with the full blown Win 8.1 operating system and the soon to be free upgrade to Win 10 for 8.1 owners plus all the features of a full blown PC in a tablet (with limitations for memory specs) I can finally relax while on a tablet and never be let down. This thing is amazing it what it can handle. As for Win 8.1 it's got it's quirks and all but overall I am so glad to be able to never have to deal with Android or an iPad for any tablet usage ever again! Finally I found a great value in tablets that didn't disappoint.\n\n It boots fast, runs well and hasn't disappointed at all. Most of my Win 7 software right down to Norton AV runs great on this and it simply leaves any Android in the dust when it comes to ease of use and practicality, not to mention compatibility.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "A family member wanted to give me a gift, and I chose Stream 8 (came directly from HP, but the same model that is sold here). I wanted to have a portable entertainment for kids and an occasional laptop replacement to work away from my office. Be careful what you wish for!\n1. Appearance. It looks like most other tablets: black. The back panel is made of soft plastic and is easy to scratch. It has to be pried open by force to reach SIM and microSD, and I worry that it will break easily.\n2. Wireless. It can receive Bluetooth, WiFi and GPS signals. When compared to a dedicated GPS unit and with my smart phone, Stream 8 took longer to acquire coordinates and calculate routes (all 3 devices were next to each other). Keep in mind that GPS navigation needs maps. You can either get them like your smartphone does (e.g. over 4G; this would need a lot of data transferred) or like a conventional GPS unit does (this would take a lot of room on your hard drive, if you can find them).\n3. OS. Everything that you heard about Windows 8 is true. It is only a bit less annoying when you have a touchscreen. On the other hand, desktop interface and desktop-oriented programs are much harder to control by touch alone. For example, pinch-zoom is often not supported.\n4. Performance. The device appears severely underpowered. It has the computing power and RAM of a common smartphone, but has to run a heavy OS. The unit often freezes or lags while responding to commands, loading web pages or performing other tasks. For a long time I had nothing but a couple of Microsoft programs on it, and it looked like it was struggling even with Minesweeper. It needs the same antivirus protection as any other Windows computer, but running a good antivirus program becomes a big burden for it. I wanted Windows functionality, but cannot fully take advantage of it.\n5. Preinstalled programs. It comes with a cloud-oriented version of Office. Seems reasonable because of scarce local storage, but needs constant Internet connection and a lot of data transfer. Not practical for me. It also has an HP application, which is supposed to keep you updated about new drivers, etc. It seems buggy. At one point, it took me through countless consecutive rounds of installing the same BIOS update. At another, it was telling me to buy a memory upgrade, which wouldnt fit this unit.\n6. Ports. There is only one microUSB 2.0. This is really pathetic. I understand that this is an OTG port, but to fully use it you need to carry a bag of adaptors. Charging while using a peripheral is annoyingly complicated. And all the adaptors add up costs. Even cell phones often come with separate HDMI ports, while many tablets have 2 USBs. Not to mention that modern devices come with a much faster USB 3.\n7. Free 4G. This was the decisive factor for me to choose this model. I hoped that it would outweigh any drawbacks. It seems to me that HP was selling the units without proper arrangements with T-Mobile. When I just got the unit and followed the instructions, I couldn't connect to 4G. After two days of trying, I contacted T-Mobile and spent hours on the phone with them.  The reps appeared oblivious to any special deals with HP, but tried hard to sign me up for various paid plans. With no luck there, I continued my quest by contacting HP. That also took some time, but, finally, there was a rep who knew what I was talking about. We ended up having a conference call with T-Mobile, whose rep finally acknowledged the deal. It took quite some time to set up a new account. I was told that I will get a temporary allowance of data, but in a week everything will be fixed permanently.  Ten days later  no permanent fix. After another Odyssey through T-Mobile customer service, I was given another temporary allowance, to become permanent in a month. It did, after another lengthy call.  So, it took me many hours of effort and 1.5 months of wait to make sure that the advertised deal is honored.  Hardly worth the small amount of free data. My plight is not unique: HP customer forum has plenty of similar stories.\nOverall, inferior features and difficulties in setting up free 4G make me give it a low score.\nPS. It is very unhelpful for Amazon to bunch together reviews and ratings for different models of Stream.  These are different products, with different features and different expectations."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "First off, did not buy this device from Amazon, but currently cannot leave a review at hp.com.\n\nLike Windows 8.1, between my wife and I, we have a Samsung Series 7 Slate, Dell Venue 8 Pro, and the HP Stream 8 with 4G. So, I do have some experience with Windows Apps. These devices have 4gb, 2,gb, and 1gb respectively. The Dell and HP both have Atom processors.\n\nWe were extremely with the HP at first, especially with the free T-Mobile 200mb for life data plan. All we needed for light web browsing when out and about. The love affair ended today well after I can return this device when apps are now sluggish after app updates. In fact one app crashes every time I try to use it at the same point. I suspect the issue is the RAM, only 1gb. Hopefully the app developer or MS will fix this issue.\n\nWho knows, I may be able to use the app with this device again one day, but for frustration free operation, I will look for devices that have at least 2 if not 4gb of RAM. You might want to do the same."}

What is the use of having a beautiful High resolution screen if there is blaring light from the edges. It was so noticeable that I actually thought it might have been a manufacturing error since no one seemed to complain of this is other reviews.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I use this to surf the web, watch videos and video chat. Typical use by the average person.\n\nJust two pieces of advice:\n1. Use Windows Explorer to get the free Microsoft Office.\nI tried with Chrome and Firefox neither worked. Spent more than a couple of hours with both HP and Microsoft assistants trying to sort the problem out. No luck. I'm usually a heavy Chrome user, it was my default browser. Tried using Firefox, my (previously) second favorite, no luck either.\n\n1.1 You can install Microsoft Office on another computer.\nIf you have another computer with the same Microsoft account you can note the URL when claiming the Microsoft Office upgrade and input it in another computer.\nMy laptop now runs the 1 year free Microsoft upgrade. Remember the upgrade is for one PC, so my HP Slate 7 doesn't have Microsoft Office.\n\n2. Update the graphics driver.\nGo to the Intel site and search for the latest drivers.\nThe popup box that Intel had when it was time to click install wasn't user friendly. I couldn't drag the box in either portrait or landscape. The whole box couldn't fit on the screen in either orientation. Eventually I connected a mouse and was able to click and hold to drag the box and access the install button on the far right bottom of the box. I did try doing this by touch, but it didn't work. That exercise was frustrating. I blame Intel for that.\nAn alternative would be to note the driver's version, do an internet search or search within the Intel site, get another link and download it from there. A final alternative would be to download it on another computer and transfer it to the HP Slate 7.\nWhy upgrade the driver? It helps with the screen mirroring (Miracast).\nJust in case you don't know about this, if you have a compatible device you can project (mirror) one screen on another. I project movies and YouTube videos when my friends come over onto my smart TV. Remember it projects exactly what you see on the tablet's screen.\n\nFor the HP slate 7 Internet explorer is my choice browser. It runs smoothly and has pinch and zoom.\nI use Chrome on my laptop 80% of the time. But on the Slate 7 Chrome is slow. My Firefox has the same extensions as Chrome (except Hangouts) but runs better. I tried running Chrome in Windows 8 mode, that didn't help either. Even with Hangouts disabled Chrome runs slowly so I uninstalled Chrome. Firefox is the choice browser for sites where Ad Block is needed.\n\nI also purchased a 2.0 female to female adapter to connect a memory stick or Bluetooth mouse/keyboard. That's useful, I recommend getting that.\n\nI purchased a 32 Gig storage cause that was the amount recommended as being the maximum for the device. I read in other reviews that people purchased larger and it works properly.\n\nThe camera isn't the greatest, but this is a budget item.\nThe item feels a bit heavy.\nThere's no gesture typing so typing is slow to me. If you're accustomed to tapping the screen then this isn't a setback for you.\n\nIf you're not running intensive programs and you want value for your dollar then this is the tablet for you, HP Slate 7.\n\n(If you have battery issues try updating the WiFi driver.)"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "You can't beat a full windows tablet for 99 dollars, but keep your expectations in check. I am mainly using this for transferring music files from a Galaxy Note 3 and web surfing. This is not something you would want to use with resource hungry programs or games. I have come across some stutter and lag, as well as some touch input issues, but nothing overwhelming. The bluetooth is kind of touchy and I have had trouble keeping my phone connected. Oh, and it is not the exact size of a Galaxy Note 3, unlike what a reviewer said. It easily dwarfs a GN3, but is a small and cute form factor.\n\nHelpful notes: If you want to receive bluetooth files you must go to desktop. On the right side press the arrow going up and you will see a set of icons. Press the bluetooth icon. Select receive or send a file. Make sure whatever you are syncing with has already established bluetooth service. Pick your file, and share. DO NOT let the screen go to sleep you will lose progress.\n\nSidebar menu: Swiping to left bring up a list of recently used apps. If in portrait mode, all apps seem to be full screen. In landscape mode they can become split screen, and you can adjust how much of the screen it can take up. Just select whatever app you want and slide it across the screen: some apps however are full screen only.\nSwiping from right with bring up PC settings and other info. If you want to turn on bluetooth you have to go PC settings, but you will still have to go to desktop to send or receive files. You can also get to the control panel from here.\n\nStartScreen: If you familiar with Windows phone or a Zune HD you now about live tiles. You can arrange them how you want or add programs. You can swipe down a level to see a complete list of all apps and Windows progams. I suggest pinning the task manager to the startscreen because it is the only way you can kill apps and programs, because there is no universal back button.\n\nIE: there seem to be two versions of the Internet Explorer. The desktop version, which is less touch optimized, and the Metro version at the start screen which was thought of with touch input in mind. I suggest the Metro version which is less frustrating. It is much more touch intuitive.\n\nOverview: I find the HP Stream 7 to be a quite handy device. It is great if you are on a budget and looking for a servicable PC. This is not a smartphone and you should not look for the same experience as an Android or IOS device. It is also not a PC powerhouse, but you can do a little serious work on it. The only problem I find with it is that Microsoft seems to be having issues marrying the Metro and desktop elements. There is to much going back and forth to use different services. Metro is nice and refreshing, but you can only do any serious work with the desktop. If they can get Metro as useful as the desktop, the they will have something great or their hands. I got this because I needed a PC experience for cheap and wanted a tablet. As much as I like Android, I did not want the same experience as I can get on my phone. I had a windows phone in the past, while I liked the platform, I had a few Android programs I was chained to and switched back. I have also owned a Zune 30 and a Zune HD which were fantastic devices, which birthed the Metro aesthetic, which I love very much. So this is perfect for me. If you want the same experience as a smartphone, look elsewhere. If you need a spec monster top of the line PC experience, get something else. If you want a functional computing device that can handle a few serious things and can handle your entertainment needs check this out. It only 99 dollars folks, so don't expect the world, but it still a great value.\n\nEDIT: Make sure you install updates to get the bluetooth functionality. You can pin app to taskbar from startscreen, long press any tile and you get a set of options: pin to taskbar/start, uninstall and resize."}

SORRY it is so long, read major update at the end !!\n\nJust to mention Win 10 runs well and fixed a bluetooth problem. Every Win 8.1 update turned of bluetooth, and the touchscreen stopped working. With Win 10 the touchscreen is working all the time, and so far only one bluetooth turn off, and with the touchscreen working I was able to delete it, and rescan and bring it back.\n\nFINAL UPDATE: I bought from Microsoft direct with no bloatware, for $150 with free data this is the best tablet I have owned. The 8\" screen is perfect size for my need, it is fast enough for my needs, it runs all my programs that android can't, I can do VOIP calls on it, and I have DATA around the world thanks to T-mobile DATA agreements. Far better than my Android cell phone, better than my iPhone, small enough to carry anywhere, good battery life. I can do EVERYTHING I need to do on a tablet. It is NOT a Toshiba S55-B5289 laptop with an Intel Core i7-4710HQ Processor 2.5GHz, Microsoft Windows 8.1; Mobile Intel HD, Memory Card Reader; 8GB DDR3L-1600 RAM, 1TB 5,400RPM Hard Drive, it is a great TABLET.\n\n----------------------------------------\nThe tablet has been in my hands for two days. see 2. for T-mobile sighup fix\n\n1. This is my first experience with a tablet running Windows 8.1 - 8.1 was created by a team of idiots. if they think a user of Microsoft products since the first PC is going to like this they must be on drugs. I got a new Laptop a week ago and the first thing I did was install a free program that restored the Windows 7 or before interface that Microsoft started to get people to actually be able to use computers. I run DosBox as I still use DOS programs, DOS worked, did everything I needed and while Windows is cute everything still runs with DOS as the basic system behind all the graphic crap. Windows 8.1 is great for kids who do not have any experience with pre-Windows 8.1 or old people who like pushing icons on the screen. A simple menu with batch files work perfectly well for me for 35 years. and my new laptop did not come with a touch screen, and  there is really no need for it on a laptop. - Ok Windows 8.1 sucks, but on a tablet Google Android is 1000 times better, maybe Wins 10 will be better. The big advantage for me is my new tablet runs DosBox, Quicken for DOS 8, my old DOS accounting package and the Windows programs that I have upgraded over the years. Android does have DosBox, but I really needed to run Windows (might do it under Linux, but this is easier)\n\n2. Biggest problem is the T-mobile FREE 200 mb signup and how you do it. It is easy, but somehow Microsoft or T-mobile made it hard. You follow the directions, and your done, no wait you get an error message telling you your account could not be set up call an 800 number. You believe the message, as I did and call the number. The account rep tells you the sim card CAN NOT BE ACTIVATED and makes up several reasons. While he was very nice it became obvious by the end of all this that he had no idea why the card was locked out. That is because the card WAS ACTIVATED BEFORE. so my thinking was maybe I got a refurbished unit ? Well if I had to guess with all I know I got a NEW unit, but the signup process is the problem. Yes the card is locked because you activated it when you created the account, the error message I got was WRONG. The first agent sent me to new activations, they also did not know why I was locked out, then the third department was able to see my account had no error, was activated, that's why the card is now not useable for a new activation, it IS ACTIVE ON THE ACCOUNT YOU  CREATED when you tried to create the account and no one at T-mobile in the first departments can or did access if the card was on an account.\n\nOnly the PRE-PAID department can find the answer, the other departments do not have the access to the pre-paid accounts.\n\nSo to sum it up, do the activation, write down the account you created and the password, when you get the error message do not call the 800 number till you power off, then power on your tablet, and check to see if you are on the internet. I assumed the message that said the account could not be created call xxx-xxx-xxxx meant the account could not be created call xxx-xxx-xxxx. What the error message actually said was \"your account was created, your on the internet dummy, did you not think to ignore the stupid message and try it first ?\"\n\nSo creating your free for life account is as easy as Windows 8.1, thanks Microsoft or T-mobile.\nI know who created Windows 8.1 not sure what idiot created the FREE sign on process, but it is FREE until they kill it.\n\ndisclaimer, I am a long time T-mobile customer who got feed up with Verizon, and AT&T. Verizon employees were downright nasty and disrespectful at times The T-mobile people were very nice and helpful, of course the last one in the PRE-PAID department was the one who actually had the answer. I never thought to check if the account had been created and the service was working, the message was clear, and after reading all the one star reviews on activation I can understand the frustration. So before you call T-mobile, check if the activation is working, and if not call the PRE-PAID department and save a lot of time\n\n  3. Ok now as to the tablet - If you are planning on running lots of programs, Lightroom, Photoshop, and video editing, forget it. This is a basic Windows tablet with little power, the SSD drive which speeds up the unit really helps, I would say it is a mini-computer that you can run some basic programs on. I need a bluetooth keyboard and mouse for most of my work. And a stylus might be a good idea, never used one, but my big hands really have a hard time in Windows 7 mode, and DOS does not know what a touchscreen is. So far I think I will like it very much, as it I do not expect the performance of my i7 new laptop. This little tablet runs all my programs that my Androids does not. The 8\" screen is really better than my 7\" Android size wize. 10\" is to big, I think, maybe in a few years I will try it with my next tablet.\n\n  FREE DATA FOR LIFE - IS A DEAL - BETTER THAN FREE TABLET WITH $14.00 per month for life.\n  ( hint my wifes tablet has 3GB of data and she uses 20 mb of data monthly, pulling a switch real soon )\n\n  If you read this far please like and follow my review, I do update them if something goes wrong\n\nMAJOR UPDATE:\nNow the most important part. On March 30, and several times before I asked my T-mobile people if when I got the table, and activated the sim card if I could switch the sim card between my wifes tablet and my tablet. My wife has yet to really use her tablet, and when I found it, it was totally dead. So I thought why not take her 3GB plan that is not being used and put it in my tablet, and give her the 200mb free plan, in her tablet. Well it can be done, but expect to spend time at a T-mobiles store, and then call the PRE-PAID people again. I can tell you to try the switch, you might be lucky, but if you as I did have problems CHARGE both tablets before going to T-mobile. I am not sure why it is not just a swap sims deal, but I now have 3GB's in my tablet which WILL be used, and 200mb free in my wifes tablet which may not be used. NOTE, my wife has an iPad from work with no data sim slot and I got her the Android so she would have data on the go. The second trip to T-mobile AFTER charging her tablet got my HP with 3GB data working, not my wifes tablet with 200MB for life.\n\nAt the store they managed to get the my HP tablet working, a good 90 minutes, and it was obvious they could not figure out the FREE Sim problem. I had found only PRE-PAID can work with the FREE Sim. Then 60 minutes with PRE-PAID, had to go to tear 1 (tier 1) tech list reader, who had me do a factory reset, before sending me to tier 2 support who reset something on their end which he said was a system wide problem for the last week. I can only advise to have ALL data off your tablet before you call. My wifes tablet had not been used and had no data since I gave it to her so it was not an issue to reload the apps she had installed but never used.\n\nI will always keep the 200MB data for life on a separate account, as it is always handy to have one free device, could throw it in my deactivated hotspot, or whatever. A spare working data sim is a good thing, and right now in my wifes tablet it works and I doubt her tablet will ever need more data.\n\nApril 1st (and this is not an April fools thing)\nI am very happy with the HP Stream 8 with 4G, I bought it direct from Microsoft and it had no bloatware, so much easier to just deal with the sim swap, and not have to remove the bloatware too.\n\nOk, I had a 7\" android, so I got the HP Stream 8\" with 4G, this might very well be a 5 start product, time will tell. I have had no wifi dropping, and actually no problems, as others have described, but I am only in my first 5 days of ownership. So why a one star review, 5 days to get the 200mb of FREE data for life working the way I wanted it to, and only 5 days in my hands. Anyway I have updated my review three times and will continue to do so. For $150 direct from Microsoft, no bloatware, FREE 4G data for life, Windows that runs ALL windows programs, and runs DOS programs, who would not be happy.\n\nThe charging cable is the important part, like my canon scanner, you MUST use the original cable. How dumb is that.\n\nFor those who do not SHUT DOWN when not in use to conserve your battery - well SHUTDOWN is SHUTDOWN, SLEEP is using battery till you SHUTDOWN. I like hibernate - it uses NO POWER, I use it on my laptops, and now on my tablet.\n\nAm waiting for my case with bluetooth keyboard to help run DOS programs, I skipped a bluetooth mouse for now.\n\nThe Case http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QRVDSWI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 is almost perfect, keyboard magnet really does not hold, but I am very careful and I found one at Walmart the same size just in case(it has no magnet).  I have been using a Logitech mouse, but ordered two bluetooth ones. I really wish Logitech did not use a dongle, because I have to use the OTG dongle for the Logitech Unifying receiver, and do not like it hanging from the tablet. I also ordered some styluses to try one, they will be my first.\n\nThe keyboard is a life saver, as DOS does not work with touchscreens, what was Microsoft thinking in the 80's, where they not watching Star Trek? DOS runs faster on this machine than my desktop 486 of old.\n\nNow if I can find a map program as good as Streets & Trips, or Google Maps, but I have an Android for that."}

Point to add: If you are tech minded and willing to work through software/hardware issues then you will have no problem. If you want a pick-up and go tab with little to no upkeep, I'd look elsewhere (Android/Apple).\n\nCons:\n- Signature edition does not work out of box, at all. Mine arrived with NO drivers installed what-so-ever and no way of installing them without a MicroSD card or Micro USB OTG cable. Neither of which are supplied.\n- Frequent WiFi issues. Connection drops or becomes limited with incorrect updates or drivers. Still to be resolved.\n- No HDMI out. Video out can be achieved through wireless media applications, such as Serviio.\n- Window's store is sparse (Not HP's fault) and popular apps are often not available (Instagram, Youtube etc). Hopefully this will improve.\n- No other native browser supported (Chrome, Firefox, Opera etc.) and to top it off Bing is IE's default search engine and is not changeable.\n- Battery capacity is not the best but can be cared for by switching off Bluetooth/Wifi etc.\n- Low on the RAM side but run's applications fairly well.\n\nAll in all, for the price I paid, a very good tab. Falls short on out-of-box usability and additional features."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "A 7 inch tablet is a strange bird these days, with 6 inch smart phones and 8 inch \"mini\" tablets.  However, 7 is a great size for those of us who have smaller-screen smartphones (in my case, GS4) to serve as a companion tablet.  I also own a Lenovo S8-50 tablet which, while great, would not accept exFAT formatted microSDHC cards.  Given that most 1080p MP4 movies can run >4GB, this was a problem as my collection of videos could only be viewed streaming.  This also eliminated the Kindle series tablets, so I was looking for a Windows compatible media player, and the Stream 7 caught my eye.\n\nMy main use for this tablet is watching video - streaming (Netflix, HBO, FX) and off microSD (Handbrake conversions) at the gym and on a plane.  Yes it comes with a 1-year sub to Office 365 personal, but I already have a 365 University account, and this wasn't of use to me (I copied the key code just in case I needed it for a friend's computer).  Besides, anyone who thinks they are going to work Office apps on a 7 inch screen either have really good vision, or are masochists.\n\nThe Stream isn't the first time I have used a Win8.1 tablet - I also have an original Surface (which is a tad too large to prop up on the treadmill at the gym), so I'm familiar with the limitations of Windows 8.1 RT.  With those expectations, even though the Stream 7 runs \"Windows 8.1 with Bing\" I did not plan on running legacy and desktop apps with it.  In fact, other than for system maintenance, the desktop isn't that helpful anyway.\n\nI won't bore you with specs as you can find them in the description.  I will tell you that the real world feel is different.  While most 7 to 8-inch tablets are lightweight, this one weighs as much as a full blown iPad 4.  In fact, the Stream 7 is almost twice as heavy as the android-based HP 7 inch tablet.  The screen is crisper than the Surface - to be expected, they have similar resolutions but the screen is much smaller (increased pixel density) so movies look much better on it.  Even my SD video conversion look better on the smaller screen.  The screen is bright but, as expected, will wash out in sunlight.\n\nSound is average.  The mono speaker isn't as crisp or loud as the Lenovo S8, and some users have complained of humming sounds when earphones are plugged in.  This may be due to the placement of the microUSB port, which is right next to the headphone jack. And, ludicrously, is ON THE TOP OF THE TABLET! (see gripe below).\n\nThe battery life is average, as expected.  It's comparable to the Lenovo, in that I can get about 3.5 + hours of video playback before draining the battery.  An hour of web browsing will drain the battery 20%, so I figure 4+ if you're just doing that, with brightness down to 40%.  Intriguingly, the back of the tablet snaps off (the entire back) to reveal the microSD slot and the battery - though it's not replaceable.  Though it's tempting, for sure - there are screws back there and I think it would be an easier matter to open this sucker up.  Hmm.\n\nSo, for a sub-$100 media consumption device, putting aside issues with Windows 8.1, it's a pretty good deal in my mind.  7 inches is an interesting size these days, as some people at the gym asked me \"what phone is that?\"  (It's the HP MegaPhone XL!)\n\nGripes and Missed Opportunities:\n1. Putting a charging port on the TOP of the tablet is a major fail.  Granted I can flip the tablet 180 degrees but this puts the Windows home button on the top and it's just weird.  Plus, placing it so close to the audio jack probably has lead to the complaints of buzzing noises (interference).\n2. A removable back on a tablet is such a unique thing, and in order to offset it's bulk and heft, having a removable battery there would have been an AMAZING feature.  To my knowledge, there is no tablet currently out there with a replaceable battery.  On a long plane trip, this would add the convenience of swapping out cells when the first one runs down.  It would have been a major differentiator for the Stream.\n3. There's a barely noticeable gap between the bezel edge and the top of the screen.  In that gap, there's a little pinhole I assume for a microphone.  However, the gap is definitely a crud magnet and has already started to accumulate some dust.  Another design issue.\n4.  I just can't figure out why this tablet has to be so heavy!  The Lenovo S8 uses the same processor (Intel Atom) and has the same battery, but is half the weight.  Maybe I do need to tear it down and see why..."}

Given Windows OS on a mobile is terrible and the huge lack of apps, I had to return.  I looked at the app lists before buying and seen some apps I used.

Notebook, or Windows 8.1 Pro Tablet using the same subscription included with this device.  In fact I have done so in my case I wanted to install it on my Razer Edge and all I had to do was log into my Microsoft account go to my subscription and download office pretty much the same process of doing it on the tablet. I do have to point out though you have to download Office onto the tablet first to activate the subscription.\n- For the price its built quit well and performance is decent comparable to a netbook or pretty much any quad core Intel Atom processor based PCs\n- It's not a gaming machine but it will run pretty much any type of casual game as whale as some older PC games.\n- It runs the full version of Windows 8.1 and includes Office and despite its Atom Processer and lack of RAM it runs them both pretty good.\n - accepts up to 64GB at least that I've tested\n - It has a standard 32/64 bit processor so I have a 64GB SD card in it and dual boot linux. You could possible use it as a hackintosh machine but I'm not sure how fictional it would be without a mouse and keyboard.\n\nCons:\n- If you're looking for an entertainment device well an android or apple tablet is more suited for you as there's more apps and what not more suited for tablets then the Windows Store\n- 1 gigabyte of RAM so you won't be doing a lot of multitasking or having a lot of browser tabs open\n\nMy thoughts:\nI wouldn't recommend this as a primary machine but as companion to a desktop/laptop for students it gives them a tablet that they can use for entertainment as whale as be productive on the go. And also gives them a copy of office they can install in their main desktop/laptop. I originally got a \"HP Stream 7 5709\" for my mom for her birthday which was the $99 one. So when I was about to buy a 1yr Subscription to Office 360 I found out that there was another version the \"HP Stream 7 5701\" which is $79. The only difference between the 2 is the $79 version comes with 3 pre-installed HP apps which you can remove but they're not that intrusive. Where as the $99 version comes with a clean install of Windows So for $10 more you get a tablet.\n\nTo be honest I have a Razer Edge tablet which I do a lot of CAD and design and I find having a touchscreen useful and  I basically bought this tablet just to get a 1yr Subscription to Microsoft Office 360 I didn't need nor want a Widows tablet but for $10 more why not. But that being said it run the full Windows OS. Which means I can install my CAD software and while I might not be able to edit and draw in it at least not productively its a lot smaller and lighter than my Razer Edge which makes it useful for when I just need to show off some designs or even remote into any of my other machines. I'm also finding that I can simply lay it around the house for guest to use."}

We put them on the wall next to each conference room so people can schedule appointments and such.  That's its only use in my office but it's a full working Tablet PC.  I got a chance to play with one of these for a few days before we installed them and I thought, \"Really?  $100 dollars for this awesomeness?  Talk about bang for the buck!\"\n\nIt's running Windows 8.1 and it's pretty fast.  32 gig flash drive can be upgraded with a MicroSD so no worries there.  You can't really go wrong here,  8 hour battery, Wi-Fi, touch, tablet and Windows 8.1 in a compact unit that feels solid. Install your apps, play games, read books and just have a good time.  Office is great and 1 terabyte on Onedrive is fantastic. I work professionally as a developer on both Mac and Windows and I'm really impressed by what Microsoft is doing lately and HP has done a great job with their hardware.\n\nUnfortunately, the one that came in today had a minor blemish on the screen (I'm sure this is rare. It looked like a particle got stuck between the glass and the screen) but Amazon came to the rescue and is shipping me a new one in the next few days.  I like this so much I bought a second one.\n\nI played around with the idea of getting the HP Stream 8 with 4G but decided I didn't need it.  It only comes with 200mb free monthly data from T-Mobile for the life of your device. I think this is pretty cool, but 200mb won't cut it for me because I'm connected to Wi-Fi 95% of my day.  When I'm not, if I need it, I'm tethered to my phone data plan.  I'm not even sure if there's a way to upgrade that plan as I didn't see any option and I didn't bother to look hard enough.\n\nTL;DR: It's a great value. If you have $100 burning a hole in your pocket and you want a functional tablet running Windows 8.1, consider this one.  The battery life is decent given the screen size and I'm going to use my second one to control my apartment, the Internet of Things, where everything is connected to it.  Lights, TV, Xbox One, etc."}

Software keyboard is not intuitive and slow to respond to obvious use cases. Overall the device has very slow performance which is possibly software related because some programs doing similar things perform better than others and various times. Windows does not appear to manage hardware resources as well as iOS and Android. The tablet is very heavy thick compared to others in the same class. Ability to go to windows desktop is interesting but it is gimmicky, too small, and not optimized for a touch interface. It is unfortunately also necessary to go to the desktop way to often which makes it feel like a small laptop with a missing keyboard or mouse. Software selection is severely lacking compared to iOS or Android."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I'm ambivalent about giving this only four stars... after all, I paid $79 (Feb 19, 2015) for this Windows 8.1 tablet. Who has ever heard of paying less than $80 for a Windows tablet. Just last year, the Windows operating system, by itself, was selling for over $100. The Stream has a very view-able screen. It is fairly easy to navigate in tiled format, but what I just feel slighted about is that it only comes with 1GB of RAM. Now I know, 1GB of RAM is great for a $79 Windows tablet. What isn't so great, is that I can't upgrade it to 2GB. I'd be willing to pay extra for an extra 1GB... I'd certainly give this a five-star rating. I've seen blogs elsewhere, that the CPU of this device cannot accept anymore than 1GB, so I guess it's a hardware limitation... oh well. Nonetheless, I am unable to satisfactorily run Quicken or kind-of what I bought it for, my Play-Fi, play everything remote control. Play-Fi does operate on this, but it drops out much more frequently than it does on my desktop, or my Android tablets (with less RAM). If your needs are small, like a few pages of a MS Word document, or 100 columns in an Excel spreadsheet, or you browse the web, and occasionally watch video, this is a great deal (BTW, a one-year subscription to Office 365 is $75... so it's like you get a Windows tablet for $4 (what's not to like about that?))! At this time, Amazon is selling the 7\" Stream for $95, but if you look around (like the Microsoft store or HP) I think you can still find this for under $80. It's a great VALUE even for $95, but beware that you may not be able to run your most used Windows apps.\n\nUPDATE (3/17/2015): I thought I would write an update to talk about my experience pairing this HP Stream 7 to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/iGo-Stowaway-Ultra-Slim-Bluetooth-Keyboard-for-Blackberry-and-other-PDA-Handhelds/dp/B0002OKCXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard for Blackberry and other PDA/ Handhelds</a>, a Bluetooth keyboard, which I purchased on Amazon about seven years ago. So, first off the Stream had Bluetooth turned off. To turn it on, I swiped from the right side and chose [Change PC settings]->[PC and devices]->[Bluetooth]. I switched Bluetooth On, then I tried to pair the iGo Stowaway Keyboard with the Stream. - Nothing -. Well, I was actually picking up phones in the area that I could pair with, but not the keyboard. Then I noticed something that wasn't happening: the light on the iGo Keyboard was NOT flashing. I knew I had new batteries, so I closed the keyboard case, then opened it again, saw the flashing light, pressed [Ctrl]-Blue [Fn]-Green [Fn] together, and -Viola!- I clicked on \"Bluetooth keyboard\" on the HP Stream (now that it's paired it says \"Think Outside Keyboard\"), and clicked on [Pair] then typed in a seven or eight digit number on my iGo, and the HP Stream downloaded a driver (or something), and yippee! I was able to use my iGo. Unfortunately, at this time, it appears the \"Think Outside\" company that produced the iGo Keyboard is either not in business and/or is not updating their drivers for this item. I am not able to use the special [Fn] keys like [Fn]-Numlock and such, but this Stream paired with the iGo make for a great combination for more than the average amount of typing for a tablet. If I ever find an updated driver for the iGo, I will update this review, and maybe this will benefit someone wanting to do the same thing or at least something similar.\n\nUPDATE (4/17/2015): Okay, I've complained above about lack of RAM... although I wish it did have more RAM, I have been able to run Quicken on this HP Slate. I tweeked the virtual memory. Microsoft hides virtual memory, so heres a run-down on how I got to it. Click-and-hold the Computer icon in Windows Explorer or This PC from the [Start] menu> Properties> Advanced system settings> Advanced (tab)> [Settings] button>Advanced (tab)> [Change] button.\nFor the C: drive, I unchecked Automatically manage paging file size for all drives and then I selected the option button System managed size, then I click [Set], then [OK], then I rebooted. I haven't had the error messages in Quicken (2015) pop up again, although (sigh) DTS Play-Fi does still drop-out more often than I would like. It's not bad now though. Still 4-stars. I like this Slate, but I don't LOVE it."}

I am running Office and Quicken 2007 and Firefox, uninstalled Office 365, rather buy than rent software. Have about 12GB left on 32GB card that comes in unit-C: drive, after all software and updates. As with most tablets, they want you connected to the internet as much as possible, just uninstall what you don't like.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I have been heavily invested in Android Tablets for a while and was always curious to get my hands on a windows tablet. Surface 3 was just beyond my affordability. The opportunity then to buy a 7 inch tablet at the sub $79 price point and being used to a 7\" inch display anyway was worth the money and effort to get a fully functional windows tablet. The tablet is exceptional for the price and quality although a tad heavier than expected. Nevertheless it's now my mainstream tablet and allowing me to install some good software of my choice and liking. It has also allowed me to become quite familiar with Win 8.1. Overall a good tablet to have as a primary and even a spare. Battery life is ok and depends on what you use it for. Screen is fair and streaming is good. The OTG USB interface is a welcome addition and I was able to improve Wi-Fi by adding in a n300 adapter for improved multimedia streaming when required. Additional storage via micro SD is a plus too. For the money I am happy for this to be a workhorse tablet accompanying me on the rituals of work travel. Surprisingly I have held the 8 inch version and it feels lighter, for now though I am quite happy and enjoying the additional benefits of Skype (60 minutes / month) and office 365 thrown in the mix for a year."}

The screen is good and the apps are also very nice. I use this tablet mostly for school and it can handle me using multiple tabs on the internet as well as word. I also very much enjoy the screen splitting. It makes it so much easier to do my school work. Just be ware you do get what you pay for. This is a cheaper tablet and it may not do everything that you want it to do. I just bought it to do school and read my books. I do not play games on it or anything along those lines.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "If your looking for a low budget tablet this the one. I brought mine through Windows, and I recommend to buy it from them. Why? Because along with the insurance for two years, shipping, and tax I spend about $140 or less. Back to the tablet. It's basically like a iPad mini but without the big price tag Apple offers. Look at a iPad mini and compare it this HP tablet then you'll understand me. Apps are very bad, but since the tablet acts like a small PC who needs apps. The camera is so so and the forntal camera is very bad. The tablet sometimes has its moments. Like sometimes the WiFi connection decides not work randomly and to fix this problem you have to restart the device. When comes to Word or PowerPoint its also okay. I do most of my typing in my MacBook. Majority of the time, I have no problem with this tablet. If your a Windows person go get this other then this it's a good tablet not the iPad mini. It can stand against it, any questions about the tablet ask me."}

This is not to be confused with a Windows RT device, this is the real deal. Full Windows 8.1 and should qualify for the free Windows 10 upgrade upon release. This tablet runs the full gamut of terrible Windows store applets as well as a full desktop version of Windows 8.1. This unit will natively drop to a desktop and run .exe files.

In some ways I feel the criticism is unfair, like judging a dancing bear on how well he does the waltz - it's not about how well the bear dances, but the fact he dances at all!  For the price, this is an excellent little machine.  I got it for about $160, and so far it has run everything I have tried on it.  No, it won't run the latest games at high res, but I can watch Amazon Prime, Dish Anywhere, and Netflix just fine, as well as run MS Office apps and pretty much everything else I need.  It makes a perfect travel companion.  I would not use it as an everyday computer, but it works well enough with a bluetooth mouse to be a decent computer on the road without taking up too much space or risking a thousand-plus dollar machine.  Definitely worth the money, and an excellent companion to your main computer."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "When I read the specifications, this seemed like the ideal tablet.  My day job is Windows administration.  Having a device I can use from anywhere when I'm on-call would make supporting my co-workers convenient and easy.  My hobbies include writing and blogging, which also benefit from having Windows and the Internet wherever I am.  So the HP Stream 8 with \"real\" Windows 8.1, 4G Internet, WiFi, a micro SD slot, a camera, USB, and Bluetooth seemed like my ideal device.\n\nUnfortunately, the tablet I received had a line of dead pixels down the screen. Amazon was great and shipped a replacement immediately.  The replacement had a great screen, but developed bad blocks on the SSD and WiFi trouble in the first night (before I'd installed anything other than Windows and HP updates).  When the tablet would go to sleep, the WiFi card stopped working and had to be switched off and on before it would work again.  Three strike in two tablets.  Both went back to Amazon.\n\nFor a $150 tablet, if it hadn't had the hardware issues it did, I'd speak pretty highly of it.  I thought the screen looked crisp and clear (unlike an Acer I once tried to use), the performance was tolerable (for a 1GB RAM Atom based device), touch-screen response was good, and in general it felt solid and comfortable to work with.  It was a little heavier than I'd have liked, but not too heavy to slip into a coat pocket.  I liked the design, except for the micro SD port being under the flimsy plastic cover on the back.  (Though I did like the fact that the cover exposed the battery, which might be replaceable someday.)\n\nI never got to try the 4G internet before I returned it.  If I'd had activation problems, I might have tried swapping the SIM out with the one from my Nexus 7 to see if that worked.\n\nOther things that could be improved here... 1GB RAM is not enough for most mainstream applications.  This device really ought to be 4GB minimum.  With the bundled software and OS, only about 20GB of the 32GB drive could be used.  The device needs either a user-upgradeable SSD or a larger built-in storage device.  You could drop the micro SD if you had that.  Unless the battery was replaceable, I'd want the back cover sealed, with the SIM and SD slots accessible from the side of the device.  A second USB port would also be good, since you have to use the first to charge the device.\n\nI like HP products in general and believe it's a good company, so it pains me to leave a 2-star review, but I have to be honest with my fellow Amazon shoppers.  My experience with the Stream 8 wasn't positive, and I can't in good conscience recommend it based on that.  I'm hopeful that HP will release a second generation of the device that addresses the hardware issues and improves on the specifications.  If so, I'll be one of the first to order it.  My ideal device would be a small, thin, light Windows 8.1 device (think Nexus 7 dimensions) with decent performance, 4G LTE, a good rear camera, and 6+ hour battery life.  Whoever makes that first will get my money."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I bought this tablet while it was on sale for $79. I find it to be a nice,and snappy little tablet. I got it for the times I don't want to carry around a full sized laptop. It does hold up to daily multi-tasking needs. It may not be equipped with all of the fancy features as some of the more high end tablets on the market have. But it is well worth the small price tag it has on it. The one thing I do find that I don't like about this tablet is when trying to bring up the taskbar with your finger. It is unresponsive at the very edge of the screen when using auto hide for the taskbar. Which is not a problem when you use a mouse as it just pops right up. If you don't have a bluetooth mouse. The only other way to combat this is to just leave it on screen at all times."}

A little hard to use some apps and other Windows programs with a touch screen, but once I received a case & keyboard it has made things a bit easier to use. I only gave it 4 stars because of the 1 GB ram limitation, but it actually works a lot better than I thought it would. Windows apps are not great, it has me looking for ways to successfully run an Android emulator on it. I would recommend it to anyone who carries their laptop with them just for some basic web browsing, social media, watching videos, listening to music, but keep your Android or iPhone around for your 95% of apps that are missing from the Windows store. It's more of a mini laptop than a tablet.\n\nEDIT: Don't expect to do much multitasking with this device. However, many programs still install and run just like on a regular Windows 8.1 computer, just a little slower. Just today I downloaded Windows Movie Maker and edited a video I recorded from my camera.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "A reasonable little tablet for the price. There are some downsides, and some things I would like to be different in an ideal world.  I got this because I wanted something with more \"computer\" functions than most tablets, and I wanted to access email on the road, and this supplies that.  I can access email on the road, which I needed for work.  The screen is larger than most smart phones, but it is small enough to be much more portable than a laptop, which were features I also wanted.  I was looking for something very inexpensive and was deciding between this and the WinBooks.  I ended up getting the HP because a friend recommended it.  (I paid $80 on Amazon, it might be even cheaper elsewhere).  It does Not have a full size USB port which the WinBook is supposed to have, and that is inconvenient.  (They need to remove the U in USB since they are no longer universal having 2 sizes). However, I use a full size-to-micro adapter which helps, though increased the cost of my cheap tablet.  It also has an SD card slot which is nice, but my 2015 laptop does not have one so initially I had to dig my 2005 netbook out of the closet to transfer data from laptop to netbook then netbook to tablet.  The touch screen is a little \"stiff\" so you have to be determined to open a function or type a letter, but that is not necessarily always a bad thing because there are less accidental keystrokes (this is without any screen cover or protector).  It comes with a lot of bloat-ware apps, but I was able to add some things that I use more commonly.  All that being said, overall I am happy with this tablet;  it does the things I wanted to be able to do and it did not cost too much.  I would recommend it as a viable alternative to the more expensive tablets out there."}

She didn't see the importance, but I felt it would help her in a couple of areas: having a convenient tool for e-books and research, as well as something she could use in the kitchen, as she does a lot of cooking from scratch. I was right, she liked it.\n\nBut...\n\nThe tablet had a lot of trouble staying connected to our wifi. I thought perhaps that it was our router, which was a bit flaky anyway, and was already on my to-do list of things to replace. New router, still no joy. I updated the drivers, even re-installed Windows and still couldn't reliably connect to the wifi except for five minutes after rebooting. So I returned it. Thanks to Amazon's generous replacement policy, a new one arrived in a matter of days.\n\nThe second unit had no major connectivity issues. The battery life on the replacement was abysmal. Literally, the battery would be depleted within a couple of hours, even if the unit was asleep and unused. After perusing the forums, someone suggested keeping the volume turned to zero. I tried it. Funny enough, it worked. The battery is still not great, but it doesn't drain like it used to.\n\nIn general, it's a decent computer, but I probably should have waited for version 2 of this tablet, to give HP time to work out the bugs. I mentioned no *major* connectivity issues. Every now and then, it cannot connect after waking and a reboot is the only solution. It doesn't severely impact use, but it's an annoying glitch.\n\nFor $100, you get a decent Windows 8 device that can run Office, browse the web, and is very conveniently portable. Just keep close to an electrical outlet and beware that the hardware is not the best quality. You're not getting a Porsche at a Kia price."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "OK! This is my first bad review for a product. I have been making almost all of my purchases from Amazon for 18 years. I was looking for an 8 inch tablet with Windows 8.1. I saw the HP device and knowing that over the years HP was a stellar printer manufacturer and also way back when, the leader in instrumentation. I purchased the HP Steam 8. What a nightmare! The box comes with several booklets expounding how getting activated on T-Mobile will be a no brainer. I spent 3 hours on the phone talking to numerous T-Mobile support people and not a single on knew anything about the HP and T-Mobile joint deal to give the notebook purchaser 200MB for life. Finally one guy told me; Ok I will give it to you out of the kindness of my heart.\nHowever he said I had to wait two hours before I could try to use it. I told the guy I was an engineer and why would I have to wait two hours. He had no good answer. Two hours later I booted my OS went to settings as the included instruction sheet said I turned off WiFI and turned on Verizon broadband and then selected Internet Explorer and I would be instantly connected and using my 200MB of data. I got a big screen that said you cant connect with your service. Finally I just gave up and wrote that off.\n\nThe next problem was with a windows feature. I was testing out various features when I made the mistake of enabling the Narrator. This little known feature speaks each command (Touch) you make. The problem was that when I turned Narration off it kept coming back after each time I turned it off and verified it was indeed off. Each time I rebooted Narrator was back on. Not only that the screen was frozen. Fortunately I was able to access Settings. I turned Narration off temporarily and shut down the tablet. Finally I Reset the tablet to the factory settings which took about 30 minutes. Narration is definitely off! So I like the basic tablet and now windows 8.1 seems to work OK. Its a pretty fast hardware set. I have installed several apps and  so that's why I give it 3 stars. -- Regards -- Bill"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "The HP Stream 8 is a really nifty tablet.  It comes with 200mb T-Mobile data per month for life with is nice (but you'll eat it up fast).  It also allows you to fully use the Office Suite, and mine came with a free year of Office 360 (I already had a monthly subscription to 360 and it still gave me the free year which is also great).  Additionally the Office apps automatically resize themselves to the little screen, so I have done split screen work with two documents and had an easier time of it than much larger laptops.  I'd recommend a case and keyboard of some sort, because otherwise when the keyboard is on the screen it occupies far too much real estate.  I grabbed the \"Infiland HP Stream 8 Tablet Bluetooth Keyboard Case Cover - Folio Slim Fit PU Leather Case with Wireless Removable Bluetooth Keyboard\" and have been really happy with it (though it doesn't come with a stylus).  The touch screen is also good, but the right click functionality takes a little getting used to and is always a bit wonky.  So why didn't I give it 5 stars?  Because the drivers for the WiFi and REALLY wonky, I'd say about every other week they just don't work and you have to either reboot or reboot and install new drivers.  It's incredibly annoying and I don't really understand the problem."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "Update 8/17/2015: I updated the tablet to Windows 10 and it works fine enough. The tablet does slow down from time to time, making it impossible to use and therefore forcing you to restart the device. I don't know if it's the specs in the tablet that can't really handle 10 as seamlessly as 8.1 or if it's just 10. I have run into a few Windows 10 anomaly's within the software so I'm hoping it's the latter that's having issues. Nevertheless, I recommend upgrading to 10 and also keep in mind that SP1 is going to be released late September. The Windows 10 upgrade is free to download so long as you download within a year, it's fully functioning and it's completely free with no threat of charges later.\n\nUpdate 6/14/2015: 4 months later- The screen flickering issue is attributed to Internet Explorer only. When I launch the browser not too long after I start using it the screen starts flickering and I have to force the device to turn off. If I use Firefox and Chrome I have no such issues so I just don't use Internet Explorer. Overall this is a solid device and I honestly like it. I can't believe it was so cheap, it's worth the price for sure. This device is a solid 4.8/5. A larger screen and a better keyboard would make this a solid 5/5.\n\nUpdate 3/6/2015: I was having issues with the screen flickering and I was going to try for a replacement but as it turned out the screen flickering was not due to the hardware, it was a software issue. I ran an application that removed the drivers that was not installed properly. I figured this out when I got the blue screen of death last night. This device is performing properly now.\n\nOne more caveat, but doesn't detract from the tablet: If you are not going to be using Internet Explorer and intend on downloading Firefox or some other browser please keep in mind that there is no spell check on any other Bowser outside of I.E. Now, for me I have somewhat big fingers and for whatever reason I can't seem to type right on the keyboards and with the lack of spell check there will be a lot of errors to go back and fix, making typing annoying. Without a keyboard it's a pain. My blog website doesn't function properly on Internet Explorer so I have to use Firefox but I have a keyboard. It's worth the investment. My review is back to a 5/5!\n\nUpdate 2/24/2015: Flickering screen. It didn't happen at all yesterday so I figured it did, indeed, need to be turned off over night. Last night I turned it off, charged it up and turned it back on this morning. Worked fine all day until now. The screen started flickering again. I restarted it, worked fine for 30 minutes and started flickering again. Restarted again and it seems to work for now. Outside of this irritating issue it's a really solid, very useful device. If the screen isn't stable it doesn't do the device a whole world of good. Rating dropped down to 4/5. I am going to contact Amazon about this and see about a replacement.\n\nUpdate 2/21/2015: I have had this tablet for a week and it's still a solid device for me. The only con I now see occurred yesterday. I was using my tablet when the screen began to flicker. It went dark and then started shifting between light and dark repeatedly. I figured it was just an anomaly so I put it to sleep and woke it up, still same issue. I finally restarted and the screen came on solid and has been ever since. This alarmed me a bit, I just hope this isn't going to happen again. If it happens again I will report back and change my rating to reflect the issues. I don't turn it off at night, just plug in to the charger and put it to sleep so perhaps it just needed to be restarted...\n\nBefore I decided on this tablet I researched for about two months along with the Stream 7 and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 in 8 inches. What made me choose this over the Stream 7 is the extra inch of screen. I chose this over the Tab 4 mainly because I have had Android in the past (tablets and phones) and besides the HTC Sensation I was not impressed and sometimes downright irritated over how the devices performed. I always hesitate on Android when it comes to any kind of device. I have owned iOS in the past (iPad mini and iPad 4G) and liked the interface but Apple was a bit more costly than needed to be spent at this time.\n\nWhat Am I Using My Tablet For?\n\nBlogging - I was spending countless hours in front of my work computer updating my blog. My office chair is not that comfy and I felt like I was stuck at work as opposed to posting at leisure.\n\nEmail - Due to my working from home I am always getting multiple emails a day and with no tablet that meant that either the email had to come through my phone which kills the battery or through my computer which means that when I'm off the clock I am still stuck to my computer.\n\nMusic - I have the XBOX Music Pass because my cell (Nokia 521 Windows 8.1) streams and downloads the music. This was one of my selling points, I didn't want to have to use another music database had I chosen another type tablet since I was already subscribed to the pass.\n\nSocial Media - I also use Facebook, Google Plus and LinkedIn. While I can use Facebook on my phone, Google Plus and LinkedIn was a bit more irritating on the cell (Google Plus being the worse).\n\nProductivity - I don't create a lot of documents but I do from time to time and wanted a device that is able to perform certain duties i.e PowerPoint presentations, Word documents and Excel spreadsheets when I need it to.\n\nEntertainment - I watch Netflix, Amazon Prime shows and YouTube a lot. As it stood before I acquired this tablet I had to sit at my computer at times when I just wanted to lounge and relax.\n\nFeatures\n\nFull Windows 8.1, no RT - The difference between full and RT is that with RT you have a more scaled down version of Windows. You have applications that are compatible but there is a large limit on what you can use the tablet for. I would say it's more in the lines of iOS with the lock down of what you can do. This is fine if you aren't using it for much but I wanted a full experience for the possibilities it created. Full basically means you can do just about everything on it that you could do on your Windows PC. For example, I tested downloading iTunes and was successful in installation, launching and using. This would not have been available to do on RT.\n\nFree year of Office 365 Personal - This would otherwise be $69 to purchase so that's very nice to include.\n\nFree T-Mobile Data - This tablet comes with free data of up to 200mb a month. 200mb is not much but if you're like me and don't really head out much then that's a lot for you. If you require more data there are other prepaid plans you can get or if you have service already this can be added to your cell phone data plan. Only for T-Mobile though; it could work on other carriers but you would have to contact them to find out. Difficulty level in connecting was a 4/5. My SIM card was already in the tablet when it came so in case you see the plastic with the card punched out chances are it's in the tablet.\n\nBattery Life - I have noticed the battery life is draining more than I thought but in all fairness I have been playing with this tablet since I got it. If you are a light to moderate user (check social media, browse the internet and check email) then you should get a day or more out of this tablet. If you're like me and use it for other things like creating documents which requires the screen to be on the entire time then expect the battery to die throughout the day. I have charged this up a couple times and have noticed the battery indicator never reaches 100% charged. It reaches 99% but never that extra percent. Not sure completely why but it doesn't bother me but may bother others. From dead to 99% charged it takes approximately 3-4 hours.\n\nNote: I turned my tablet off and kept it charging all night and when I turned it on this morning it was at 100% charged, indicator green, but didn't stay there but for a couple minutes.\n\nStorage - The storage capacity is 32gb and the amount you can use is 14.7 or something close to that. This decrease in used storage is due to the operating system and pre-installed applications. I did purchase a 32gb micro SD card but I'm wondering if perhaps I need to go ahead and grab the 64gb card instead. The jury is out on that but the SD card by Samsung worked fine and was recognized. To get the SD card to work you just have to do a few file path tweaks to make sure applications, music and files install to the card as well as the C drive.\n\nDevice Functionality - Due to the lower specs one would think that the tablet wouldn't perform well, just bare minimum and that's it. That couldn't be more wrong. So far I have been able to use multiple applications at the same time and haven't noticed a decrease in speed or functionality. I think it all comes down to what you are using it for. If you run a lot of powerful applications at once then you may see a dip in overall performance. If you are using Word and listening to music while updating Facebook (like I'm doing right now) them your performance will be fine. Speed also affects hardcore games like World of Warcraft-type heavy graphics. This tablet will not run them and if it does the performance will be abysmal.\n\nBluetooth - I purchased the Infiland Bluetooth keyboard which came with a case and connected it to the tablet. It took a while to figure out the instructions because what they were telling me to select in the instructions wasn't how it was listed in Windows 8.1. However, I managed to connect it with no extreme issues. Only thing is the Bluetooth installation was a bit slow, took about 5-6 minutes to install. Other than that everything is connected and stable. I also turned the keyboard off and turned it on later and it reconnected without having to set everything back up. Solid experience.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis tablet is meeting my expectations and doing a lot more than what I was looking for. At this price point I wasn't looking all that forward to it because I knew the specs were considered bottom tier when compared to competition in the same price range. I am pleasantly surprised and now can't imagine using any other type tablet. I would highly recommend if your usage is more along the lines of what I use tablets for. If you are a hardcore gamer I would look elsewhere because you will have issues as this isn't a gaming tablet. It's almost a shame to call this a tablet, it's more of a shrunk down computer but when you think of the limitations on graphic heavy games reality comes back that this is a tablet, and a darn good one.\n\nNote: I typed this entire write-up on this tablet and it worked excellent!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I wasn't expecting much with this tablet. On paper, it's nothing special spec-wise. But once you start using this, you'll see that it is more than adequate for your needs and the tablet performs very well. As a bonus you get a free year of Office 365. I personally don't myself doing much computing from this little device but it is a very nice bonus to have.\n\nThe build of the tablet is plastic-y but solid. It does have a little weight to it so hand holding it for long periods of time can be tiring. The IPS screen is by far the most impressive feature of this tablet, it amazes me that HP would use such a nice screen for a low end device. The external speaker isn't very loud but I really didn't expect much out of it. The micro USB port does support On-The-Go cables so you can plug in your favorite USB devices to it. MicroSD slot is also a nice addition.\n\nI'm not a big fan of Windows 8.1 but the 'metro' UI does work for small tablets and phones IMO. Animations and transitions are smooth, I have noticed lag when there's something running in the background though. Overall, this is the best value for your dollar and you can't go wrong with this purchase."}

I bought this as a gift for my dad and I keep taking it to use it because it's really good. It's a great combination of a tablet and laptop(if you buy the keyboard add-on). App store has what I was looking for(except for youtube, you have to get a 3rd party app). Comes with Microsoft Office, just read the agreement to make sure you don't get auto-enrolled for autopay, but it's a year free of Microsoft Office so can't complain. For the price, it delivers beyond expectations.\n\nI've used other tablets(Amazon Fire HD and Apple tablets), I liked this one the most so far, only if it was a tad bit bigger. There are some limitations due to ram, but this tablet is perfect for business and school work related uses. Haven't played games on it, not really why I bought it so I can't comment on that aspect."}

The unit feels heavy, looks like a lump of black plastic with a screen, has horrid sound, useless cameras, battery life is too limited to make this a truly portable device (maybe 4 hours tops.) Windows 8.1 Bluetooth audio has micro pauses when streaming music. Steam 7 Bluetooth was tested with LG 700, LG 730 headsets and DKnight MagicBox Bluetooth speaker. All work as expected with my Chromebooks, Chromebox and iPad but the audio pauses when used with the HP Steam 7 and my updated Asus Windows 8.1 RT Tablet. Microsoft can not get Bluetooth right! On the plus side, I did not notice any distortion in audio when using a wired headset. Many have complained about noise when using the audio jack and suggested Bluetooth as an alternative. As noted Bluetooth skips and drops audio so if one of the unlucky customers with defective audio jacks you are out in the cold when it comes to decent audio. Not recommended! Note: I purchased from Microsoft for $80 and looks as if I will get a chance to test their return policy.\n\nBluetooth update: Too early to guarantee but Bluetooth steaming may improve if notifications are turned off. I have tried with both my LG 700 headset and DKnight BT speaker with no skips or pauses noted using Music player with MP3 file and the SpotLite app. Shall see ...\n\nBluetooth update 2: Was too good to be true.

It also comes with a year's subscription of Office 365 personal edition, which, by itself, retails for $69 at many stores (not Amazon, of course!).

If you need to store a lot of Office-related files, this tablet accepts micro-SD cards up to 64GB, but you must remove the back cover to access it. Not a very hard chore.\n\nGiven its low price, 1GB of memory and 32 GB of storage and a slower, but decent Intel Atom processor, this tablet is not going to replace a Core I7 laptop or desktop unit anytime soon, but it could come in handy to edit and revise MS Office files on the fly! A very good buy for $79! Now, I'll see how well it holds up before I award it a fifth star!"}

I bought it on a whim because the price was so ridiculously low, and already own a surface as my main tablet. As others said, it performs excellently as a secondary device to keep around the house and use for Miracast or a quick task when watching TV. Although the RAM is low, it still seems very speedy, thanks to the quad core processor. Simply fantastic value for the money."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I bought this tablet for my boyfriend because it was VERY cheap compared to other tablets that are similar. While cheaper doesn't always mean better, I have to admit this tablet is well worth how much I spent. It runs great, picture quality is top notch (comparing it to my iPad mini with retina) and we had no problems with the screen being iffy or it being hard to use.\n\nThis tablet is perfect for students. My boyfriend had to type up a letter so he turned on his 3yr old laptop, but it was SO SLOW. He whipped out his tablet, turned it on, opened Microsoft Word (which is free for a year!!!), typed the letter, and printed it before his laptop got to the log in screen.\n\nHowever one downsize is how much this thing weighs. Wow, it's pretty heavy compared to other tablets. I was surprised when I held it, considering it's only 7 inches. It's perhaps the same weight as a medium size book. I doubt it'll cause a problem if your lugging it around all day, but something to think about... The camera battery is low quality (the front camera especially). Also, the battery life isn't the best. It lasts about 4 to 5hrs. But for $80, I can't complain."}

We were not in the market for a new tablet but we were trying to decide on what cloud service (google drive, onedrive, Dropbox, etc) to go with to backup our families photos and data.  This device was basically the tie breaker, for $80 you get a years worth of 1tb onedrive service (from most cloud providers that by itself is $85-120) and a pretty capable 7\" windows 8.1 tablet!!!  The value of what you get is more than deserving of 5 stars.\n\nAll that said, if money were no object there obviously are better tablets on the market.  I don't think the screen is as nice as our other tablets (dell venue 8 pro or the iPads), the contrast ratio seems to be average at best.  More ram and a micro hdmi port would be nice, though with the right attachments the lack of ports are not an issue -- the ram will become one depending on how it's used.  And as for the operation of the device, I personally love windows 8.1 OS from an options standpoint.  If I had to choose one tablet to own it would be a windows 8.1 device just for the options and complete functionality.  I do think the iPads have superior interactivity and support (in some areas) but iOS is more limited in how it can be used.\n\nLong story short, the HP Stream 7 is not perfect.  It could obviously be free and loaded with every feature on the market but as it is for an $80-100 tablet it's incredible -- you definitely get a whole lot more than what you pay for."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "Overall Impressions:\n\nI didn't buy my HP Stream 7 from Amazon, I got it from Office Depot witch happened to have an awesome sale that made it about $1 cheaper. This tablet is truly Amazing, I can't believe how well it works. I have had the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.2 for a couple years using it for college. I thought that was a great tablet, I had nothing but good things to say about it. Now that I have this HP Stream 7, I can't imagine going back to my Samsung tablet. This Tablet can run full versions of office (Word, Excel, Power Point, etc) with no problems. Other tablets tend to mess the formatting up with their \"word compatible\" apps. You even get all of Microsoft Office for free for one year! I truly wish I had chosen a tablet with Windows 8 OS for college. This runs just as a normal computer does for under $100, and works so well with the ability to snap two things at once such as your e-mail and the internet browser and much more. I downloaded the full PC version of a music writing program called Guitar-Pro 6 expecting to run into issues with the program. I was wrong, it runs just fine on this little tablet. It actually runs the program more smoothly than my friends MacBook Air Pro (MacBook has choppy playback). I think that Windows 8 OS is a little confusing at first, but once you get use to it, you will thoroughly enjoy using it. Another great feature is that the charging port is Micro USB. It's nice because the majority of all of my other devices also use Micro USB. It makes things so much easier. I would highly recommend buying this powerful little tablet. I couldn't be any happier with my purchase.\n\nBluetooth/WiFi\n\nThe Bluetooth works great, you can easily sync up to more than one device at a time. The most I ever tried was 3 devices which included the Bluetooth keyboard I used to type this review, a Bluetooth portable speaker, and another tablet we have here at home. Everything works great all at the same time which is a huge plus.\n\nThe WiFi works just as well as most devices. I used the Ookla internet speed test and get about the same internet speeds with my Nokia Lumia 930 (within a few mbps), it's not as fast as my $1800 Alienware laptop, but it gets the job done. I can easily stream in HD such as Netflix, HULU, and Amazon Instant Video. This tablet won't disappoint!\n\nSize/Feel/Functionality\n\nThis tablet is very small, so keep that in mind before you buy it. I find it comical when people complain that it's too small and give it bad ratings for that. It clearly states 7\" screen, if you are unsure that you will be happy with that, simply go to Best Buy or Office Depot to look at, feel, and play with a variety of different sized tablets. The size doesn't make it a bad tablet, it makes the buyer irresponsible by not thoroughly researching a product before buying. Now that my rant is over, here is what I think. Yes, this tablet is pretty small, and in my opinion is rather heavy for it's size. Weight doesn't bother me much, it's less than a pound, so I don't see that ever straining my muscles. Typing on the touchscreen isn't too bad, but it takes getting use to. The most difficult thing is getting use to selecting things while browsing the web or navigating programs. It just takes getting use to, if you have trouble with sight, you may want to get a tablet with a larger screen. Even so, you can adjust the text size, browser size, and all of that fancy stuff just as you would with a PC. I got a really cool case that came with an amazingly good feeling keyboard here on amazon. It makes typing incredibly easy&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Fintie-HP-Stream-7-Keyboard-Case-Premium-PU-Leather-Folio-Stand-Cover-with-Removable-Wireless-Bluetooth-Keyboard-for-HP-Stream-7-Model-5701-5709-32GB-Windows-8-1-Tablet-Black/dp/B00QAJZ33O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fintie HP Stream 7 Keyboard Case - Premium PU Leather Folio Stand Cover with Removable Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard for HP Stream 7 (Model 5701/5709) 32GB Windows 8.1 Tablet, Black</a>. It looks very professional, is built well, and makes typing much more tolerable. This is what I am typing this review on. I was easily able to create a Power Point presentation for my internship with this tablet. What really makes the difference is that you can snap the web browser and Power Point (along with any program) allowing you to copy/pate pictures, read and re-type information, etc. I just ordered this mouse:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Microsoft-Sculpt-Comfort-Bluetooth-Mouse-H3S-00003/dp/B00BZC31WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Bluetooth Mouse (H3S-00003)</a>&nbsp;Just to see if/how well it works and how much it improves navigating the tablet versus using your finger to select everything. It is suppose to work great specifically with Windows 8 OS!\n\nMouse Compatibility (Microsoft Sculpt Comfort):&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Microsoft-Sculpt-Comfort-Bluetooth-Mouse-H3S-00003/dp/B00BZC31WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Bluetooth Mouse (H3S-00003)</a>\n\nI got this mouse in the mail today (02/13/15) and have to say that I now feel like I have a small notebook (PC) instead of a tablet. The mouse synched up instantly and works great. Even on this small tablet, I now feel like I can work for hours on it. Once the mouse is detected, the Windows 8 OS displays the classic mouse icon and allows you to navigate the system just like you would a normal PC. On top of that, this specific mouse has a unique little feature to it. There is a small blue Windows touchpad/button to the left side where your thumb sits. If you push the button, it cycles from what ever program you are using to the home screen. If you press it while in the \"touchscreen\" home screen, it will take you to the normal desktop allowing you to go back and fourth with ease. Plus, if you swipe from the top down, it pulls up your task manager. If you swipe from the bottom up, you can seamlessly switch through the programs that are currently running. It is a truly amazing little mouse. Not to mention it feels great, has good response, and vibrates when you use the touch pad. I am thoroughly happy with the features of this tablet!\n\nSpeakers:\n\nThe speakers are loud enough for casual listening but don't have enough power to listen to from too great of a distance. I would say that the speakers are rather weak for my taste. I enjoy listening to music while I work around the house. The good news is that there are many portable Bluetooth speakers that work great. I hooked my tablet up to a JBL Flip Portable Speaker. These speakers are extremely loud and should work well for the majority of people. The Bluetooth works from very far away allowing you to connect to the speaker from almost anywhere in your house. The link to this specific Bluetooth speaker is:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/JBL-Flip-2-Portable-Wireless-Speaker-Black/dp/B00GAJ2OK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">JBL Flip 2 Portable Wireless Speaker (Black)</a>\n\nBattery Life:\n\nThe battery lasts me the entire day with moderate use. My use for this tablet starts at 5AM when I wake up to check my e-mail, read articles, etc. I then use it fairly heavily while at my internship. I had an hour long presentation using Power Point on this tablet and continued to use the tablet through the rest of the day even at home. I didn't have to charge it until later at night, around 6 or so. The battery life is pretty good and should last throughout the day.\n\nCamera:\n\nThe camera is not mind blowing by any means. But for a little 2MP camera, it takes decent pictures. If there is any movement, bad lighting, etc. the picture won't come out very well. I am fortunate enough to have a 20MP camera on my Nokia Lumia 930, so I use that instead.\n\nAs stated previously, I think you will very much enjoy this tablet as long as you take the time to properly research what size fits you best. I will continue to edit this review as I experience more use with this tablet."}

If HP had given this 2gb of ram it would be class leading.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "As the heading says, I really wish I could love the HP Stream 8 but I just couldn't adjust to it.  Previously, I owned a Google Nexus 7 tablet (2013 edition) and I loved it.  I used it on a daily basis.  Until, like an idiot, I dropped an LED lightbulb on it and shattered the screen. (Imagine Homer Simpson yelling \"D'oh!\")\n\nI'm a long-time Windows desktop user and read many of the reviews on Amazon before I bought it.  For $150, I thought, how could I go wrong?  The unit, to be sure, is a solid piece of hardware.  It's a bit on the heavy side for its size, but that's most likely due to the cheaper, relatively low resolution panel they used for the display.  I understood the tradeoff.\n\nThe problem for me is the Windows 8 With Bing OS that's installed on the device.  Simply put, it's not a great OS for an eight inch screen, especially with a maximum resolution of 1280x800.  Too many of the touch icons and menu items are very difficult to actually touch due to their small size on this small screen.  Likewise, the text is often a struggle to read for me (yes, my eyes aren't the greatest but I had no problem reading text on the 7\" Nexus 7's 1920x1080 screen).  The apps, too, are lacking at least for me.  For instance, I love to read the Cracked website--I tend to like puerile humor, so shoot me!--and the Cracked app on the Windows Store won't even boot.  It seems that many apps on Windows 8 have simply been abandoned unless Microsoft itself sponsors them.  And the lack of a Swype-style keyboard of any kind was the final straw.  I absolutely depend upon those for my tablets.\n\nI admit, coming from Android I knew I'd have an adjustment to make.  I also had the original Surface RT, which I never used for many of the same reasons, but I figured that maybe a full Windows 8 device would solve my problems. Unfortunately, though I was willing to make many concessions, this tablet just doesn't fit my needs.  I wish Microsoft had done a better job of scaling Windows 8 to tablet devices, and I wish their App store was better supported.  Until it is, perhaps with Windows 10, I just can't keep trying to force myself to love a product that is so much of a struggle to use."}

The SIM card that this comes with was not activated.  When I called T-mobile, they told me it was an invalid SIM # and I had to contact HP.  Contacted HP who told me that T-mobile knows how to activate the tablet, just tel them it's an invalid IMEI issue.  Back to T-mobile:  Two different customer reps insisted I had to set up an account for my \"phone.\"  I gave up with them.  Contacted HP again, HP rep said I did not have to open an account, just get the SIM activated.  Back to T-mobile:  I finally got a T-mobile rep that understood I had a tablet to activate, was familiar with the free data offer and explained I needed to open a pre-paid account that would be loaded with the free data every month, just tell the pre-paid rep that I was activating for the free data.  I get disconnected during the transfer.  UGH!!!!  Call T-mobile AGAIN, go through phone tree hell for the millionth time, get to the pre-paid rep. I give her the SIM #, then she asks for the IMEI number.  She tells me it's not a valid number, so I am not eligible for the free data.  IF you get this far, insist on a supervisor who can validate your IMEI # and set up the pre-paid account.  I'm assuming you have not murdered anyone by this point, because I sure felt like it!  After several hours of Attempting to activate the \"free\" mobile account, it finally got done.  As far as I'm concerned the data package was not free, as I spent about four hours trying to activate it.  My morale - contact T-mobile for activation, you want to open a pre-paid account with them, and insist on a supervisor to activate your IMEI # to get the free data.  It is a T-mobile activation, don't let them steer you back to HP.  Credit Card sized card that says T-mobile has your SIM # on the bottom in a red outlined box.  IMEI # is on the outside of the box the Tablet comes in.  You need both of these numbers to get this done.  Good luck!"}

That same USB port is also the charging port.  The real problem is - the changing is trickle charge.  When you have the device plugged in - you cannot use it and charge at the same time.  Any device usage means the battery is draining - even plugged in.  Definitely not a small desktop replacement with this power issue.\n\nThere is no video out.  It supports Miracast - so you'll need some kind of Miracast adapter on your display.  In theory the Amazon Fire Stick will soon support this - and I have one.  That being said - until Amazon updates the fire stick I don't have a way to test Miracast.  This limits its usefulness as a Powerpoint machine.  Miracast or maybe some USB display protocol may work - or in my case have a separate computer connected to the projector and just use WebEx.\n\nIt supports 802.11n 2.4GHz band only.  There is no 5GHz support.  It is only $150 - but in this day and age putting out a new device without 5GHz is surprising.  Luckily I have a dual band router at home - but the Cellular Access Point I have only does one frequency - so I have to choose to either run 2.4GHz just to use the Stream8 or stick with the 5GHz for every other one of my devices.  (iOS and Mac devices)\n\nYou still need a mouse for desktop apps (Office and Excel are bad with just touch).  There is a software mouse for Windows 8.1 - which works OK - but it is a 3rd party app."}

Battery life is more than adequate for my purposes. The screen is great.

A tablet was an obvious choice, and running full windows is icing on the cake.\n\nRAM: I was nervous seeing 1gb of ram, but I have not run into any issues, though I don't really push it. I would liken performance to a \"netbook\".\n\nMy only gripe is that sometimes the power button will not turn off the display, but instead will only prompt to shut-down the system. Restarting usually solves the issue.\n\n--\n\nMy initial impressions are great on this little tablet. Within minutes of setup I had chrome installed and, much to my excitement, the videostream extension works for chromecast."}

A full Windows machine that fits in a suit pocket, with universal internet (subject to cell signal of course).\n\nBut when you put a 1280x800 display and desktop Windows programs on a 8\" tablet, something gives. iPad and Android apps were written for tablets and fingers. Windows menus were designed for a monitor and mouse, so Microsoft has a tougher challenge to migrate that experience to a tablet, and it shows. Most of the time you can't pinch-zoom and put some distance between the options. It works only in browser content and Acrobat documents, not menu bars and forms. So you'll spend a lot of time backtracking from wrongly registered choices. The \"screen magnifier\" app is flaky and plain useless. When pinch-zoom is available to everything on screen, hopefully in Win10, this tablet will be a beaut.\n\nMore generally, Win8.1 tablet mode is simply not market-ready, but that's a much longer story.  Let's just say it's absolutely critical to have an external keyboard/mouse for sticky situations which will arise often. This adaptor is the key:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/IVSO-Micro-USB-2-0-Host-OTG-Cable-for-HP-Stream-8-and-HP-Stream-7-Tablet-Black/dp/B00P57JSPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">IVSO Micro USB 2.0 Host OTG Cable for HP Stream 8 and HP Stream 7 Tablet (Black)</a>.\n\nScreen capture requires a subscription to HP or Microsoft services. You can't save a screenshot to disk. This is unacceptable. Even Android (notorious for routing all data transfers through Google servers so they can Big Brother you) lets you save a screenshot to the SD.\n\nThe GPS works. Not everything I'd like, but it's there.\n\nSo if you're looking for a browser on the road, and you run new software designed for tablets, this is great. If you're a power user hoping to slide your legacy laptop DOS/Win programs smoothly to a Win8.1 tablet, expect hiccups.\n\nAll things considered, this machine is useful, and for the price, it's a steal."}

I knew I wanted a small Windows tablet and narrowed it down between the HP Stream 8 and the Dell Venue which had similar specs. The fact that it has free 4G is what swayed me to the HP Stream 8.  It's fast and responsive. Easily connected to my home wifi. I did activate office 365 and setup Outlook for e-mail.  It comes pre-loaded with lots of aps that are ready to be used. I ordered a 32 GB micro sim card to add to the already 32 GB memory. Touch screen works good. It comes loaded with Windows defender antivirus along with the Windows firewall so you should be covered. It has 1 GB Ram which is pretty basic, wish it had 2 GB Ram.\n\nHere's how I activated the T-Mobile 4G: First, I downloaded the Google chrome browser (using my home wifi) and then tried activating the 4G Broadband. For some reason, IE would not allow the activation screens to go through which I have run into with other web sites so Google Chrome is my goto. Then, went into the settings and turned on Mobile Broadband ONLY and it automatically looks for a T-Mobile connection. Then, opened up google chrome which works great on the HP Stream 8, and just as soon as I tried to access the internet, the setup screens appeared for T-Mobile. You have to choose the last option offered to get the free 4G and then everything clicked right along. You must have an e-mail address and they will send you the confirmation when the setup completes. Really impressed at how fast 4G is. It might be a little faster than my home wifi.\n\nIf you are shopping for a tablet, I highly recommend this as an option for most ages. Kids in school would probably love this. I love it and I've been using computers for 30 years. It is replacing my iPad 2 which has been a great tablet but being able to switch to a windows tablet is just the greatest for me."}

It took a bit getting used to, the small screen and having a full Windows Environment was definitely weird, but after a few software tweaks and getting all my favorite Windows Programs, it turned out to be an incredible device. Great with the touchscreen from either screen orientation, but tallways actually for me wound up being my favorite. I can have the keyboard open at all times and give me a decent square workspace space above it. Touch controls for moving around the internet, programs, and desktop environment are pretty cool once you get used to them. I found an On Screen Mouse Trackpad for pinpoint accuracy for things that just simply don't work with the normal touchscreen, but over all, the whole device is really cool and fun to use for just about anything I need it for. With a USB OTG adapter I can plug in a USB mouse and it just makes all the difference. Not only that, but it actually has a lot of horsepower, and is capable of comfortably playing Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion at lower graphics, which blew my mind. Touch Screen MS Paint is really cool too and lets me sketch out ideas easily. Taking notes is also pretty comfortable with the onscreen keyboard, and the Floating OnScreen Keyboard that comes with Windows in the Accessories Section makes for on screen text editing easy to work around, and much better than on any Android device I've used, at least in my opinion. I've used Androids and Ipads but nothing really beats Windows, and at this price, you really can't do much better. I could see how some people would get a bit frustrated at the small touch screen going through Windows, but if you like Metro, or you like toying with Windows Machines, this is definitely something worth picking up."}

Overnight it can drop to 10% from a full charge. This was almost disasterous when i had class the following evening and had a full charge the prior night. I found through the forums that if you mute the vol and kill the wifi before putting it to sleep it is fine. I have no idea what sorcery that is but whatever, it works.\n\nI can't tell if its win8.1(it probably is) but it seems buggy. Sometimes the power button will put it to sleep, sometimes it will prompt me to shut down. It can still go to sleep by dragging the right side and selecting Power, but cmon. This shouldn't work inconsistently. Its hard to navigate to commonly used areas like the control panel. Currently my workaround is to hold the desktop background, select Personalize and then go to the top bar and select Control Panel. This area has critical functions that should be accessible easily. I'm sure this us windows doing this so I didn't dock stars for that.\nWindows apps are lacking pretty severely, android has them well beaten in this.\nWhy I took off stars:\nBattery life is meh. I've had better, the above trick is what I've done to extend the life.\nMemory is OK but you won't get the full 32gb, more like 14gb after windows uses its hogshare. Be prepared to get a microsd. Currently HP says you can only upgrade to 32gb. Why does HP restrict the size???\nCamera kinda sucks, no clue why such a low resolution when they could have installed far higher ones. I'm not talking prosumer 18mp. Just more than 2mp(if I remember right).\n\nTouch screen. Holy hell I almost threw this tablet against a wall trying to select some text. My motox and 3rd gen iPod must have spoiled me because trying to get a precise area, like between a word to correct a misspelling is a Herculean effort.

I have also been wanting a tablet, and so when I found the cheap and apparently great (according to the reviews) HP Stream 7, I thought it would be perfect. I tried it out at the Microsoft Store, thought it was great, and bought it. The first few days I had the Stream 7, I started finding more and more glitches. Kind of like how when you take it into the corner of the house, the wifi bars don't go down, they completely go away. And when you try to take it into the middle of the house, it doesn't read the stronger wifi signal and you have to reboot the system to get it to work. Also, sometimes the screen rotation would stop working and you would have to do the same. Another problem was that the Bluetooth was all messed up, so I couldn't find my Bluetooth compatible printer on there for some reason. And I bet you can guess that, as a student, that caused quite a problem. The Bluetooth also wouldn't connect with my portable Bluetooth speaker. It would find it, say it was paired, and then not work and play out of the PCs own speakers instead. Even in good wifi range, the internet seems to take forever to load sites and doesn't work at all with some of the higher end ones, like website designing. The screen is way too small for Word with the on screen keyboard taking up over half the display, so unless you want to spend $50 more for a keyboard you can hook up and a mouse, don't even bother. Not to mention, the idea of it being a tablet goes out the window when you look at the App Store, which has less games than you would get on a flip phone. So, to sum it all up, I guess this tablet may be worth the money, but it would be much easier and more worth it to save up an extra $100 to buy a nicer tablet or a bigger laptop, like the HP Stream 7. Oh, and I will be returning this as soon as possible, in case you were wondering. Thanks for reading and best regards, A Customer Who Can't Make Up Their Mind"}

I love Windows 8.1 and the display is sharp, bright and clear. Unlike with the Android O/S, one can actually tweak and control this tablet using the much superior Microsoft O/S. Android dumbs you down, Microsoft smartens you up and makes computing more rewarding.\n\nThis tablet is FAST - even faster than my laptop running the same O/S. The free-for-life, 200 megabytes of T-Mobile wireless broadband is another great feature. It has an SD card slot for extra storage and the internal storage is plenty for numerous add-on programs and apps. Mine isn't even half-full and I've loaded all my favorites onto it. Movies, songs, videos and back-up can all be saved to the SD card. This thing is REAL - Androids seem like toys in comparison. Even the HP Connect music app impressed me. It shows all my album art, displays all the songs and doesn't bombard me with adverts. Much nicer to look at than Windows Media Player. Movies play great. The sound is decent from the external speakers and excellent using earphones. Some complain about a hiss in the earphones but I discovered there is no hiss using Apple iPod ear phones. I have some cheap, generic earphones that I quit using because there was a hiss/buzz especially noticed between songs.\n\nWhat else? Oh, yes. The battery lasts about six hours with a half-bright screen and the airplane mode turned on which turns off the T-Mobile broadband, the Bluetooth, the wi-fi and the built-in GNSS (GPS navigation receiver). The built-in GNSS works automatically for most apps but for the OpenCPN ocean navigating program it's just not seen by it. This can be corrected by installing and running a utility called Geolocation TCP. Start the utility first and minimize it, then start OpenCPN and it will be able to detect and use the internal GNSS via the utility - but the wi-fi needs to be turned off or the utility will default to using the wi-fi and will be inaccurate.\n\nPC Navigator 14 free, on the other hand, connects to the GNSS automatically without the Geolocation utility so the problem seems to be software and not hardware related.\n\nThe USB port is the micro-USB. So, you might need a micro-USB to standard USB cable to connect it to a USB device such as a printer or DVD player.  It has wi-fi and Bluetooth.  Printers using those two wireless protocols should connect without wires. To transfer data and files between my laptop and this tablet, I bought an Imation 32 Gig Two-in-One Micro flash drive. It has both a regular size and micro size male connector built in.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GROX596/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1  It works great and is fast.\n\nI also bought a nice little carrying case that fits perfectly,  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I8T4OLG/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5\n\nI couldn't be happier with this fine tablet.

I have a Galaxy Note 4 phone, which I love, but my needs for a tablet were almost all business related and my office has Windows 8.1 on all its machines. Programs that converted between android and Windows are good, but there was often something I really wanted to do that android just couldn't do like Windows. I finally made a list of everything I needed a tablet to do and I realized that for my needs, having a Windows 8.1 system that matched my office system was the only way to go.\n\nMy only hesitation was that I love Kindle. I read a lot, and Kindle on Android is so fantastic that I almost considered purchasing both the HP Stream 8 and a Kindle Paperwhite. Turns out, there is no need. The Kindle App for Windows 8.1 makes reading Kindle books on my Stream 8 just like reading them on my Note 4, with the exception that due to its size, the Stream is much, much easier to read. While the Paperwhite would be easier, I'm sure, if I read by the pool in the sun, all my reading is done indoors, with a once-and-a-while lunch excursion outside. I've had no problems with glare making it impossible to read and the screen has gone light enough to read in the brighter locations I've been in. In fact, I've found that for most everything I do my screen brightness averages about 1/4 of the available brightness.\n\nWith Office 360, I was up in a flash with Outlook, Word, Excel & Publisher. It's awesome to carry around such a small, light-weight computer that makes it possible for me to respond to clients as easily and effectively, with a very professional look, no matter where I am. I am also impressed with the battery life. I've found it can out last my laptop by 2 times. The reality is I've never yet run out of juice during the day. My laptop always ran out.\n\nIf you are like me and you live with Windows 8.1 in the office and you've found yourself saying to yourself when trying to do something on your phone like \"I wish I had my laptop\", but all you want to carry it around is something the size of a small book, then the HP Stream 8 is the perfect tool."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "My wife purchased this tablet for my Xmas gift.  I opened it on Xmas day and was very happy, as I always wanted a Windows based tablet.  I charged the tablet as we opened the rest of our gifts.\n\nThe tablet was easy to setup and use.  Luckily I have a lot of experience in using Windows 8 and 8.1!  After a few days, the WiFi would always go to \"Limited Connectivity\".  This rendered the tablet useless (as everything I do with I requires an internet connection.  I would need to restart the tablet to get the Wifi working again.  I have two different Wifi access points in my home, so I changed from one to the other.  No success.  I was forced to call HP tech support.  Luckily they have the chat window to do this, as I hate talking to someone who wouldn't understand me.\n\nWe tried various things to no avail.  Final solution was to wipe the tablet clean, and start from scratch.  After waiting an hour or so, the tablet came up, with a fresh install of Windows 8.1.  The Wifi still had the same problem.  HP told me I could swap it with them for a refurbished unit.  I wanted a new one, so I had my wife return it back to Amazon.  She then repurchased the replacement, which was $30 cheaper.  First tablet was $179, second was $149.\n\nSecond tablet works so far.  I have been using this tablet daily for the past 2 weeks.  I seriously hope there is no other problems with it.  I am unable to activate the TMobile 4G service because the signal is too weak in the area that we live.  I need to take this tablet to work to get a better TMobile signal.\n\nThe tablet is very affordable.  Much cheaper on Amazon than it is on HP.com.  I don't know if the slow reactions of the tablet is due to the weak specs of the tablet, or if Win 8.1 is so demanding.  A lot of times, when you press on a screen button, etc. the tablet takes a few seconds to recognize this press.  I end up pressing many times3 ,and the tablet ends up doing more than I want it to.\n\nI read that you can get the Toshiba tablet with 2GB of RAM, where this one only has 1GB.  The CPU is only 1.3GHz, but it does say (in Task Manager) that it has 4 cores.  224kB of L1 cache and 2MB of L2 cache.  The Wifi radio supposed to support 802.11n, but I can't get it to find my 802.11n router.  I have it connected to my 802.11g router instead (my iPhone 6 and Samsung S5 connects to my 802.11n router just fine).\n\nMicrosoft apps needs to get better.  This is a complaint not directed to this tablet, but more to the developers of the apps.  The Facebook app sucks, same as the Amazon.com app as well."}

I know, for $99 what could I expect. The Atom quad-core processor is capable enough for the light work one would expect to do with this tablet. I'd like to have had the option for 2GB, as I suspect that any delays encountered are likely related to low RAM, but again, it's only $99.

This can be a huge problem if you need to frequently exchange SD cards.\n\nHardware- 4/5- comes with 1 GB RAM (probably to keep the cost low), Mcafee needs 2GB minumum- will ask for an upgrade of RAM, but you will be able to skip this step and still be able to run mcafee without too much trouble,\n\nSoftware 4/5- HP assistant software - good. comes with MS office for 1 year and 1TB onedrive space. some bloatware, not very bothersome\n\nFront and back facing cameras- 2/5- very average quality cameras- enough for average day to day uses on a tablet of this size, and anyway no one buys a tablet for the cameras.\n\nMobile broadband (T Mobile) (-)5/5 (minus five out of five)- terrible terrible experience:  I got my first Stream 8 and had tons of problem activating it, ended up asking for a replacement and Amazon helped with that. The replacement tablet was no better- I have spent many many hours being shuttled between T Moble tech support and New service activation. I also made a trip to the retails store and paid $15 activation to get the SIM activated. The last T Mobile Tech support person was nice enough to give me a complimetary data pass and I am now able to use the service and my opinion hasn't changed. The tablet cannot stay connected long enough- I am not sure if this is a problem with T Mobile service and the way the data packets are handled, or it is a SIM issue or the HUAWEI mobile broadband module issue, or some other hardware conflict, but this is what happens: The tablet connects and then you can surf the internet for a while. The it will stop working and a Limited connectivity sign will appear. Then onwards it is a nightmare- now the tablet is logged with the T Mobile service and this cannot be changed easily. Wifi will turn on but since the internet is still logged to T Mobile, you cannot open pages. You cannot turn mobile broadband to the off position- it reverts back to on. Shutting down and restarting the tablet will fix this 50% of the times. The remaining 50% of the times the mobile broadband will not startup, and even going through device manager and uninstalling does not help. It will then require a hard reset (press and hold start button for 2-3 minutes), and this will fix the problem and the cycle then starts again once you connect to T Mobile.\n\nI bought this tablet for the 4G connectivity and so far this has been disappointing. To keep the tablet because of office and 1TB onderive space is an option, but this mentality is also the reason why I end up acquiring so much junk that I don't really need.\n\nI may end up returning the tablet in a few days.\n\nUPDATE 1/17/2015\nComplimentary T mobile data pass expired and I am not able to connect. got off the phone with tech support and they are unable to fix this. they say the IMEI number on this tablet is not compatible with this data plan of 200 mb per month free for life. very disappointed. this seems to be a common problem affecting many people."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "It took me a while to get this fully functional but this is a pretty nice tablet. Its pretty responsive, has a vibrant display, runs full windows, and includes 1-year of Office 365 for 2 devices.\n\nTo start, there is something between the glass and the screen. I thought it was dead pixels but it moved after I smacked it against my hand. Occasionally it'll show but I seem to be able to move it out if the way so not worth returning it. Getting the T-Mobile 4G (HSPA/UMTS, not LTE) working took 11 days. I thought it was because T-Mo is weak in my area when I fall out of LTE range but it didn't work in strong T-Mo service areas either. I waited a few days and tried again, this worked for someone on the HP support forums but not me so it was time to pick up the phone. The problem turned out to be T-Mo identifying this device as a cellular phone instead of a tablet so it didn't qualify for free 200 MB/month. After two excessively long calls to HP with some very rude customer service reps, and three lengthy calls with T-Mo and an administrative override, my little Stream 8 has a working WWAN and enough access to cover me on the occasional wifi gaps I come across.\n\nThe next problem seems to be administrative. This was advertised as including $25 of Microsoft App Store credit, but there was no code in the box and no email after activation. It took a few calls with HP and Microsoft before they determined it was Amazon's problem, and a few calls with Azn before they just gave up and gave me a $25 partial refund. Since I got this on sale for $150 I guess it worked out, although it was still a waste of time on the phone again. Amazon has since removed all mention of the $25 promotion.\n\nWith all the negatives out of the way, I've been using this for a few weeks now mostly for education and work at home access and it is great. I haven't had any issues in the Metro apps, the Windows 7 desktop apps are a little less tablet friendly but all this is probably well known. Performance is decent, I wish it had more RAM so I could use 64-bit Windows and maybe dual-boot Linux but having only 1 GB of RAM hasn't adversely impacted performance so I can deal. Admittedly I don't use any real taxing applications like PS or Illustrator, but it plays movies and low-level games just fine.\n\nSpeaking of games, I was able to use my USB Sega Saturn controller and play some MAME with the addition of a USB OTG adapter. I originally bought one of the super cheap ones that pop up on the product page but it didn't work so I bought one from Dell which allowed simultaneous charging and USB peripheral use so that's nice. It also accepted a 64 GB Micro SD card, but you have to shut down and remove the back to access it which is kind of annoying.\n\nThe touchscreen seems slightly off sometimes, even after calibration I seem to miss. Not sure if it's too sensitive or not sensitive enough but it can be a bit frustrating. It would also be nice if it had video out like HDMI or something. Supposedly you can hook up to a USB display but I don't have one.  I do have an Amazon Fire TV Stick which supports Miracast but they won't connect (Fire TV shows up as a display but it times out every time), so that's useless. No updates available for either device so I guess it's just not happening.\n\nA few quirks aside, and hopefully it's the exception and not the norm, it's a decent tablet. It's more like a laptop w/o a keboard and trackpad but that's not exactly a bad thing. I'd like to give it 3.5 stars but it's not an option, maybe it'll go up to 4 stars once I put some distance between all that nonsense with custome service.\n\nPros:\nNice display\nFree access to T-Mobile HSPA\nOffice 365 for 2 devices\n\nCons:\nHP customer service\nOffice 365 instead of a full license"}

I started the setup process and within minutes was ready to provision the T-Mobile 4G data. Big disappointment when I got an error telling me to call customer service.\n\nThat's when the nightmare began. I have spent several hours over the course of several phone calls over the past week trying to get this service activated. Each time, they tell me the EMEI is no good and they can't activate it in their system. They confirm with me that it's an HP Stream 8, comment that they don't understand why it won't allow it, then bounce me around several phone trees to different provisioning platforms.\n\nNone of them have been able to get the data plan activated for me. I am so frustrated at this point that I've started the return process. I really like everything else about this tablet, but I paid extra for the wireless 4G capability and 200mb data for life but it doesn't work."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "Bluetooth is also included. I read a few reviews and didn't see any mention of Bluetooth. I found that by using the built-in Bluetooth, I could add a wireless Bluetooth sound system, full sized keyboard and standard wireless mouse all at the same time.\n\nIt can be a little cumbersome to type on the screen for everything I do. I also can't begin to tell you how helpful a regular mouse pointer is when trying to click on some of the standard applications I am using such as iTunes. With a Bluetooth mouse ($15) and Bluetooth keyboard ($18), I can do basically everything I can do with my laptop. If I plug in a Bluetooth or wired speaker system, the sound is much better than the tiny built-in speaker.\n\nOne other thing to note is the charging brick. It works well and charges fast but I don't like to carry it around. I am already carrying the tablet, mouse and mini keyboard around in a small pouch. What I do is keep the tablet plugged into a USB port on my larger monitor at my office. It doesn't charge as fast but it keeps the tablet at basically the same level as I use it throughout the day.\n\nThe one Con I want to repeat is that the memory slot is inside the back cover. I don't mind opening it up once in a while to add something to my 64GB microSD chip but it would be nice if they included at least 1 input for transferring a large file. I have used Dropbox to get around that issue for small files but a DVD image needs to be copied onto the microSD."}

I am picky about my memory cards and purchased http://smile.amazon.com/PNY-Turbo-Performance-Speed-MicroSDXC/dp/B00N2ROG9O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1420652442&sr=8-3&keywords=pny+64gb as I would be using this for all music, video and especially program files.  Remember your onboard memory is limited, so you will be using your memory card as a hard drive, so spend the extra money and get a high speed, high end card.\n\nPick up a case for the computer, I purchased and can recommend http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QM1H9DC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 which is an awesome slim case.  I also purchased http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QP2O472/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 which is more sturdy, I use this case for travel.\n\nGrab a screen protector, I recommend http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PD03O0K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 I can confirm they fit perfect and are top quality.\n\nA tip I can give you is that iTunes will cause you issues if you use it to backup your phone or ipad.  These backups take HUGE memory and will chew up most of your available hard drive space.  I have found a way to backup to the SD card, though iTunes does not like to do this.  Just google backing up itunes to SD and you will find a way.\n\nI can honestly say that this little computer does everything that my full size Windows 8.1 Laptop does for me.  I have basically stopped using my laptop and have been using this device in place of my iPad mini (they are almost identical size) more and more.  The only advantage of the iPad mini is the apps available.  For the difference in cost I would go with the HP Stream over an Ipad mini for serious computing, but would chose the mini more as a toy.  I would recommend a wireless printer, bluetooth mouse and bluetooth keyboard to make this into a full fledged computer.  I have zero regrets with this purchase and the free 200MB of data for life and low cost makes this a no brainer."}

One pro that I saw was that once you have the stuff on the tablet, it works great. However, this wasn't going to work for me.

Still, compared to sub-$100 Android tablets, this is a nice piece of tech with a decent 720p IPS touchscreen. Battery life seems a bit poor to me, though.\n\nI have a 64 GB micro SD card with 58 GB of MP3s making this a nice portable iPod touch-like device, but having to remove and snap back in the back cover to get at the card slot is just insane.\n\nPerformance overall is pretty solid as a tablet, in particular in the Modern UI arena. The 1 GB of RAM prevents you from using it for Chrome, though even in Windows 8 mode, Chrome kind of stinks for touchscreen use.\n\nIt can run Minecraft. You need Optifine for Minecraft, plus either an OTG adapter and/or Bluetooth mouse/keyboard, but it will run.\n\nIt can run Steam. I played Crypt of the Necrodancer with a Bluetooth keyboard. It was fun. I played Shovel Knight with a Bluetooth keyboard (the NES30) which was also fun. I streamed Metro: Last Light to it using Steam in-home streaming. That actually felt pretty nuts, to be playing that game at 60 FPS on a $99 tablet.\n\nThere are some decent Windows 8 apps for reading comics. Personally I prefer a larger screen or at least sharper resolution (like Nexus 7 or iPad Mini Retina if going under 10\") for reading comics, but this definitely works in a pinch.\n\nThe speakers - er, make that speaker - is pretty bad. Some people complain about headphone buzzing (probably a grounding issue) but I don't have that. Just a bad, tinny, quiet, mono-speaker.\n\nThere's a decent $10 case available at Amazon. Buy it if you get this. Also get a bluetooth keyboard and some kind of mouse, and an OTG adapter. They're also available cheaply online.\n\nHonestly this device is 1 GB of RAM and a micro-HDMI out away from being awesome. A $99 tablet with those two additions would be killer.\n\nAlso the coating of this thing is like some magical thing that attracts and magnifies fingerprints. It is honestly astounding.\n\nAs-is, this is a pretty good value considering the $70 Office 365 Personal you get for free, as long as you have some use for it. It doesn't do anything well, but it does a LOT of things. The inability to output to the big screen feels very limiting, as I'm used to being able to do this with my cheap Chromebooks and Win8 laptops (HP stream 11 or Asus X205TA) and Android tablets (via Chromecast)"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I really wanted to keep this machine but the negatives far outweigh the positives. The size is nearly perfect (but a bit on the small side) for my use of reading and studying with markup apps, making minor changes to documents, non-serious Internet browsing, and portability inside a portfolio. I specifically wanted a full blown Windows 8.1 (not RT) so I could use research programs originally meant for previous Windows versions. The ability to expand onboard storage (not cloud) is a real plus but almost a necessary one when taken with how much of the 32Gb included is eaten up before you start using it. The lower resolution hampers some activities but this alone is not a deal killer. Speed is not that good when trying to view videos and becomes annoying when compared to my desktop that has discreet video. By the way this is really not even an HP machine. It's an Asus rebadge.\n  EXTREME hassle and run-around were encountered with the so-called free for life 200Mb data/mo from T-Mobile. The sign-up process on the machine looked simple enough, but the provided link didn't connect even after trying numerous times including a cold reboot. Upon calling the number provided for T-Mobile on the fail screen the run-around began. After it dawned on me through the thick accents and low volume call (on purpose?) that they were trying to get me to upgrade to be paying for a data plan, on saying no I got transferred to a \"special\" department where they acted like they didn't know what it was and then after another transfer I was told the \"promotion\" had ended. But both HP's site and T-Mobile's site say otherwise. After researching I found plenty of like situations and no real solution from anything officially associated with HP or T-Mobile. The data was really an unexpected bonus for a $150 machine but I say why put up with a hassle from stupid corporations at the beginning? Seems like it would wind up being open-ended pain. Added to this HP \"offers\" paid technical help from tiles on the Metro Windows. Why don't they fix their problems instead of charging customers? What kind of mentality is that?\n  Also I noticed a couple dead pixels against a homogenous screen color at startup. Again not necessarily a deal breaker but small imperfections add up and shouldn't we expect it to be perfect at the outset?\n  Some reviewers praise the free 1 year of Office 365 and practically limitless OneDrive storage (1TB). But the problem of this is that once that year is up you've likely bought into it with a year's use and the difficulty of moving to something else. I think that is their model: \"free for a while before you buy and oh, now, you got's to.\" Well, raise my rent! There are other storage and Office (MS and not) options out there that can keep you from getting hooked, that is, if you don't want to be hooked.\n  As far as HP and T-Mobile are concerned, I'm going to have a hard time not spitting before I utter their names. This is not the HP of 20 or 30 years ago. Couldn't they just as easily make their business model customer-oriented? At least the longevity is better."}

It beats my previous tablet Nokia Lumia 2520 which had a lot of good features (including free MSFT Office which is not present on HP Stream), but too restrictive WinRT OS\n- Real USB keyboard/mouse support, so I can actually do work everywhere without carrying laptop\n- Real mobile Internet connectivity (missing this feature KILLS Surface* Pro devices for me - Why there is no simple, unlocked 4G connectivity there???)\n- Meaningful battery life up to 8 hours (my Surface Pro dies in couple of hours - ridiculous and any other laptop I have also barely approaches 5 hours - too short for longer flights)\n- Fast enough for most tasks but without heating or short battery life\n- Small, thin and light enough to use as reader with one hand and large enough to use as PC (I used to have old Sony mini PCs with XP Mobile - but it was too bulky)\n- Extensible via SD card, custom SIM and replaceable battery (I have had a few nice slim devices which I thew away started from Compaq iPAQ  ten years ago where battery weaken and the costs of replacement are ridiculous). Easy opening of the back like the phone, to replace SD and battery makes full sense on HP Stream 8.\n\nThat said, I think couple of more features (maybe in advanced version) HP Stream 8 would make a really perfect mobile device:\n- second micro USB port (frequent switching keyboard and charger is not handy)\n- ability to take graphic notes with Wacom digitizer pen (this feature I like on Surface Pro, but again lack of SIM card and mediocre battery life makes it unusable for me)"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "Purchased the Stream 8 as a second, smaller tablet to augment my iPad. Thought about buying an Android tablet but the price and features of this tablet were superior - besides I wanted cellular.\n\nThe tablet itself hardware is phenomenal - crisp, clear screen and surprisingly fast for the price, What is not so great is Windows 8.1 for tablets. Before everyone decries me as an Apple lover, let me say that I started out with the PC since it was first introduced. I've gone from DOS to NT, Win2000, XP and finally to Win7. I'm still using Win7 on both business and personal desktops.\n\niOS for iPhones and iPads was written specifically for touch - Windows 8 is a mishmash that works sometimes with touch, other times you wonder what MS was thinking. What is intuitive on an iPad is not on Windows 8. So until Windows 8 (or Windows 10) is fully optimized for touch, this tablet is adequate."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "It just like a desktop computer, the only con. I have found is the power management. It is flawed. If you want for example under battery power, to stay on for an hour and turn off the screen when idle after 2 minutes (for example) does not work. The combination gets offset by the screen power off. So this means, if you setup your screen to turn off after 2 minutes but your still want to have the tablet on for 60 minutes, it won't happen, the tablet will go to sleep after 2 minutes, because somehow, the screen sleep overrides the sleep timer. I don't know why but this is definitely a problem because this tablet battery is very limited."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I got this tablet for a cheap price even lower than the $99 price.  Tablet was surprisingly speedy and you can multitask easily despite having 1gb of memory.  It does have an 1280x800 ips display which is nice and have ok battery life at full charge.  Don't expect to multitask and play the latest games but there are other problems hardwarewise and softwarewise.  Design is kind of stupid if you want to change the microsd card, you have to pull off the back cover.  Also,, it doesn't have an hdmi output and you have to use an usb otg cable (not included) in order to use an external usb drive.  Softwarewise, is not that much better either.  Windows 8 is not that great of an tablet OS to begin with compared with android and ios.  It is like putting a tablet GUI on top of windows.  The worse part is hibernation because with this flaky hardware/driver setup there is none.  You can't set up hibernation because Microsoft forces you to go with instantgo.  However, if you hit the power button without shutting the tablet down, your tablet will drain its batteries in a matter of hours.  You can go to HP's website there is a lengthy thread about it and the 'workaround' ways is to turn off the volume and put your tablet on airplane mode.\n\nhttp://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Windows-Tablets/Stream-Tablets-Standby-Battery-Drain-Workaround/td-p/4778603\n\nHP Steam 7 could be so much more, and these fixes and improvements and this tablet PC is not really ready for price time."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "Out of reluctance to go for an expensive upgrade, to my 16gb wifi only  ipad mini, I bought an hp stream 8.\nProblems which led to the purchase?\n1. Needed more storage space, ie approx 64gb, but didn't want to pay over 300-400 extra for an ipad mini with more storage.\n2. The 3-4g ipad mini cost way more, & this has a great free usuable sim without a contract.\n3. I want to run windows software which requires full windows\n4. I want to run full Dragon dictating software with a bluetooth headset\n5. I use docs/spreadsheets that are better with a mouse.\n6. Must be a small, lightweight device, as i have to also carry an office laptop\n7. I prefer folders that can be accessed by all apps in 1 place as in windows.\nThe Hp stream 8 solved all of these problems.\n\nPros\n-Free 1 yr office, free 200-250mb internet,  per mth for life, free ms office for 1 yr.\n-Storage expandable as you can add 32gb micro sd to the 32gb it comes with. (& rumours that a 64g micro sd may work with it)\n-My dragon naturally speaking 11.5 does work on it with my Plantronics voyager pro uc + bt300 bluetooth dongle (setup tge bt300 bluetooth dongle as your headphone & speaker after pairing with your bluetooth headset).\n-Not overpriced like the surface 3 & 2 , & with better freebies(considered surface but don't like the flimsy keyboard).\n-I can also tether internet from my phone as a hotspot\n\nCons\n-Battery Life, Battery Life, Battery Life\nIt needs a software tweak so it can properly sleep & switch off background apps\n- Windows 8.1 . Takes so much tweaking to get it usable.  win7 was much better. i see no advantage to metro apps, its just cosmetic & makes things & settings harder to find. Hp tech support fixed my wifi & office issues remotely. Hopefully the new windows goes back to the start menu & easy to find control panel.\n-1 gb ram/memory (why not 2gb). windows 8.1 compounds this problem as its hard to find the opens apps to close them to reduce memory overload. 8.1is a steep learning curve. You have to go back to metro apps & search or pin task manager to also close memory hogging apps. There should be a shortcut button to close apps & see whats still active in the background.\nThis unfortunately is a problem with all windows tablets, which is made worse by not having a keyboard/mouse with tge device to help get round the screen\n-No stylus. As this win 8.1 has handwriting recognition straight to office etc, so it would be great to use as a notetaking device, with a narrow pen like end stylus tip, which perhaps could be also used as a mouse.\n-No normal usb port (only 1 micro usb port (which is the same as the samsung/blackberry charging port). An otg cable is essential for this device , but not supplied\n\nSadly there doesnt appear to be a keyboard case with built in touchpad/mouse pointer,for tablets under 10 inches, that would make this device an ipad killer on price & versatility. (save for battery life issues. Why don't hp find out how other win tablets get 8+ hrs from their devices?\n\nExtra kit I use:\nfemale usb otg to micro usb, cable (to connect usb devices)\n3 port usb hub adaptor (ie if u want to add mouse, flash mem card, bluetooth dongle etc\nusb mouse, but looking out for a keyboard/mousepad/case or micro bluetooth mouse (hopefully more varieties of keyboard come out as 7-8 inch tablets become popular)\nsamsung 8.4 bluetooth keyboard (not a perfect fit but works)\nplantronics voyager uc headset (theres a ipad dragon software but it doesnt donlong docs & most ipad speech recognition apps use the internet to translate, which is problematic re privacy & i don't like using online storage for the same reason.\nusb mouse, does work & gives pointer /cursor\n\nI chose the 8 inch over the 7 stream because of larger screen size & lifetime backup sim when no wifi is available.\n\nId recommend it for the freebies But hopefully software updates sort out the other issues . I like it.\nHope that helps."}

I had to download and install Firefox, and then download my files using the Akamai Netsession. Firefox was the only browser that would allow the Akamai Netsession download. The other browsers just took me to the list of files. Well, for whatever reason, that didn't work...for several days of trying. Last night, I was finally successful and so I wanted to share the fix with anyone else looking to install Rosetta Stone on their HP Stream 7.\n\nMoving on, this tablet is perfect. It can do everything I need it to, and more. With it hosting the full version of Windows 8.1, not RT, you can install your applications you want with you. If you question whether you need to visit the appstore...keep reminding yourself, this is full Windows. I don't know how many times the app store came up in conversation with my family (all 7 of us got HP Stream 7s for Christmas :), and I had to provide the gentle reminder that Google Chrome can install from the website...don't pay for it in the app store. Who's to say that's not malware anyway. I haven't played any highend games on the tablet, but I have played Order and Chaos, which is good enough, for now. If you wonder whether or not this tablet is worth the current price, granting it's less than $100, it definitely is. I'm amazed they found a way to sell it so cheap.\n\nOh, and by the way, it's fun to find out you have to remove the back to insert your expansion microSD card, but the good news is, that was info available on Google. Don't stick things into the speaker port that looks like an SD slot at the bottom of your Stream 7...not that that happened, but still...I can see how it may. Good luck and enjoy!"}

The Windows key on the right side of the tablet (in landscape mode) is overly sensitive and has brought me to the Start screen many times inadvertently. Then many times, I'd tap a hyperlink on the browser and not get a response until about 3 to 5 taps, very annoying.\n\nI checked the remarks in the one-star reviews for this product, and none of their issues applied to me.

All in all, I am happy with the system, other than the (well-known) windows 8 problem described above. My wife and I both bought these at the same time, and she hasn't had any problems with hers yet. We consider them a worthwhile purchase."}

I accidentally got my email and Skype to work and some news channels on the desktop. It took a lot of playing around to understand how to delete things because there wasn't a minimize,restore or box to X things out. I'm always opening the desktop to go places and deleteting things above the address bar. My friends tell me my Skype is yellow even after I've turned it off with shut down. I then tried the off and button to shut it down. Its looks like it will be on forever. I can use Skpe and windows from a Wi-Fi area without subscribing to a phone service. I like that and in general pleased except my battery will be shot in no time and only HP can only replace the it."}

At under a hundred dollars (sometimes better when on sale), it is almost cheap enough to be worth buying no matter what you get. It is a full-blown Windows 8 machine in a very small package. We bought this for a teenager, I was worried that he might turn his nose up at it, he was very happy and excited by it.\n\nPros:\n-This product is an unbelievable value when you factor in its shockingly cheap price\n-It feels pretty speedy in use, despite the low memory\n-It is a FULL Windows 8 computer in a tiny tablet, very cool\n-Integrates with Xbox as a second screen\n\nCons:\n-1 GB really isn't enough memory, I wish it were not less than two\n-32 GB of flash storage is pretty minimal (we bought another 32 GB Micro SD card to round it out)\n-As other reviewers have stated it does have a screen that tends to attract smudges and fingerprints\n-It is heavy for its size\n\nWe are pretty happy with this purchase, I can't give it five stars because it isn't state of the art, but it gets four because of the amazing value. We also purchased a bluetooth keyboard and case to go with it. It was a gift for a high school student so that he can use it with his Xbox, and have a capable portable device with him at school. For these purposes, it works very well."}

Well I should have bought an HP Stream 8 sooner, it's a very capable, fast, bright screened tablet. The quad core processor is fast, pages open quickly and everything plays so far without any lag or choppiness. Having the extra storage by adding a micro SD card makes the tablet so much better, no worrying about downloading and installing programs now even though it came with 32 GB of storage which isn't bad for what they are asking for the tablet.\n  Also a full version of Office 365 for one year at no extra cost is nice as is the FREE 4G LTE by T-Mobile for the life of the unit. Not a lot of free data but it is free and will get you by in a pinch if no Wi-Fi is available. I tell you it's nice to run a full version of Windows on a tablet and not use just apps for everything, much more useful a tablet than an I Pad in my opinion.

So you have the right to do what you want.\nIt comes with 200 meg of t-mobile data for free a month for the life of the product.  Not much but it is enough to get by in a pinch.  You don't have to sign up for any other plan although you can.  You pay that much just to get a cell modem on your crApple iPads.\nThe screen is bright and clear and the responsiveness is very good.\nI have not timed the battery life but I played with it all day and had 25% left when I went to bed.  It appears to be as good as they claim with use which is unusual for any tablet.\nI found the desktop is actually easy to use with your fingers.  The keyboard can be brought up or removed at any time.  There are a number of choices from standard to a split keyboard for thumb typing.\nIt has 32gb of storage which 23.5 is available to you.  You can add a micro SD card for which I added a 64gb card.  It should take anythign in the SDXC range although the 128gb are still pricey.\nThe system seems very fast.  I am sure you could kill it with a high end game but for general use it is good.\nYou get 1 year of office 360 for free.\n\nThe downside is windows 8.  It still seems to be lagging on the application front.  You can install any of your desktop apps so that is truly a plus.\n\nI love my android tablet (I just wish they would give you the ability to use root as it is really needed by some applications).  With Google crippling the SD card with version 4.4 it has lost its appeal.  My Ipad I could do without and frankly I am amazed at how ilemmings keep crApple in business.  iOS has not changed since version 1.  You still have no active content.  Windows is definitely a good second choice and a good first choice if you need the same applications as your desktop.  It just needs a better app store although I have not had alot of time to see what is out there.\n\nI would recommend this tablet to my friends."}

But it can't download and use my business software.  To be a mobile office I could use a laptop and have in the past, but to have all your info in a tablet is perfect.\n\nFor all those reviews with battery issues - This is a PC, thus, if you do not close your programs they will continue to run in the background.  Not sleep but actually run.  I have had this for only a day but I have been working with windows 8 and have learned the basics.  So close your programs when done by sliding your finger from the top to the bottom of the screen while the program is open.  It will then be closed.\n\nTo see if you have open programs - swipe you finger from the left side of the screen in an inch and back.  You will then see a list of open and running programs.  tab the one you want to open and remember to close them when done.\n\nSleep mode - does not stop your programs from running.  It basically just turns off your screen and makes you sign back in.  Think your desktop PC.  So when you are done working or playing remember to close your programs, sign out, then turn off.\n\nApps - If you are an app person and love that convenience, then this is not the tablet for you.  Apps are limited and the ones they do have do not work like the iOS or android ones.  But the internet is the same as your PC and everything there works like your PC.  Unlike my ipad where some sites just don't act right.\n\nKeyboard - the on screen keyboard is a little wacky.  It will hide data input areas,  To get past this - close the keyboard, identify the data to be added, then bring back the keyboard by sliding your finger from the right to see the setting and press the keyboard icon.  Or just buy a wireless keyboard.  Remember you may not always have your keyboard available.\n\nWell enjoy your tablet, I plan too.  You may think that I should put this at a 3 or 4 star because of the limitations I listed.  But since I paid $150 for a tablet PC, I give it back 5 stars.\n\nOh, and feel free to install you regular programs like itunes, chrome, adobe, office, etc."}

I was also able to run full-screen NetFlix without any issues.\n\nThe processor is fast enough for most applications.  I was able to install Google Chrome browser and it ran as well as my desktop version.\n\nHowever there are some issues.\n\nThe amount of RAM installed will limit the tablet to the number applications that can run simultaneously.  Large applications will be laggy as the tablet will have to swap out to the primary storage.\n\nThe primary storage is also limited to 32GB, of which approximately 20GB is free after the Recovery partition and the Windows 8.1 installation is done with it.\n\nThis means the number of apps that can be installed will also be limited.  I recommend installing a high speed SD memory card and moving the user profile to the memory card so all application data and user files (video, music, data files such as Word and Excel) be saved there instead of the primary storage.\n\nThe tablet also comes with a 64bit processor but because the UEFI BIOS is 33bit, Windows is a 32bit installation.  This means that you cannot run 64bit software on the tablet.\n\nThe UEFI BIOS also is restricted to UEFI and does not support Legacy BIOS booting.  This and the 32bit limitation means nearly all mainstream Linux distros will NOT install on this tablet without serious hacking.\n\nThe last complaint is the functionality of Microsoft Windows 8 in a tablet form.  To be frankly honest, Windows does NOT work well in a touch environment.  While Microsoft exclaims Windows 8.1 is the best tablet-enabled version of Windows; this is a relative statement as there are superior touch-enabled operating systems.\n\nIf you want a mobile Windows tablet for running some apps, then this tablet is fine for web browsing, playing media but not suited for anything else."}

I was a bit nervous at first purchasing these, mainly because of the low price. We have tried many Android tablets, most of which were very disappointing to say the least. I still prefer Android on phones however. After using the HP Stream 7, my entire out look on Windows 8.1 changed for the better. I'm don't really like Windows 8 on desktops/laptops, but it is now my preferred OS on tablets. We are really loving these tablets more and more everyday. HP did a marvelous job on the hardware and I have no issues with the 8.1. For the price, you really can't get better hardware. I would suggest buying a USB OTG cable, so that you can easily plug in your flash drive or other USB devices.\n\nKeep in mind, you need to determine what you really want out of a tablet. For now, the Windows Store does not compare to Play Store in the number of apps available. But you still get the advantage of being able to run any windows application on these tablets and pretty much do anything a regular PC computer can do.\n\nI noticed in other comments, people are disappointed with the fact that the Office that comes on the tablets is only good for 1 year. This has been mentioned in the title and description more than once. This is a pointless issue when you consider the low price of these tablets and the quality that you are getting.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "This is my first attempt at using a windows tablet. Being a student, I was looking for something lighter and easier to bring around. I thought for $150 this tablet might be worth a shot. After playing with it for one day, here is what I think.\n\n-Screen Size: 8\" for a windows tablet is probably the bare minimal screen size you should probably go. Sometimes I find it difficult to accurately peck at the window's close, minimize, etc buttons. Overall though, not too bad. With the resolution squeezed into this 8\" form factor, it actually looks pretty good.\n\n-Ram: For 1 gb ram, the laptop works acceptably. I changed the virtual memory page size to 2-3 gb, up from the original 1.7 gb default. It seemed to help. I also turned off most of the visual effects except for smoothing edges of screen fonts. I felt this made the tablet feel much more snappy.\n\n-OS: Windows 8. Urgh. Took some time getting used to the metro and charm windows. But once you get the hang of it it is not too bad. I remember first time I played with windows 8 it took me 30 min to figure out how to turn the computer off. Sad day. Google is your friend. There are many hidden windows on the right and left of the screen. It took me a bit to figure out how to enable bluetooth. Apparently you have to enable it by going to the taskbar on the right side of the screen => settings => wireless => view connection setting  => airplane mode. You can see a slider for the bluetooth option there. I have yet to purchase a bluetooth keyboard and will be trying that sometime soon.\n\n-Microsoft Aps: I had an issue here. My IE ap crashed most of the day. Somehow it is now working smoothly...\nAlso, as another may have mentioned, it is probably better to use internet explorer on this tablet. It does not use as much memory as other explorers such as google chrome. So far I have only tried the youtube ap and it works well.\n\n-Battery Life: From how I was using it, I estimated around 8 hours, more or less the amount HP claimed the tablet should have.\n\n-Sound: The sound from this little guy wasn't too bad with its external speakers. However, there is this ANNOYING static hissing that does not stop while using the earjack. I read online that others had this problem as well. You can avoid this problem by connecting a bluetooth headphone to the device. This drove me less crazy.\n\n-Weight: It is decently light, though not as comfortable in your hand as the samsung's tablets. It is supposed to be 0.9 lbs. I haven't tested this fact myself yet.\n\n-Value. SUPERB. Paying just $150 + tax, you are essentially getting a perfectly functional low-end windows laptop, with 200 mb/ month from t-mobile (you never know when you just might need it), and a year of microsoft office.\n\nIn conclusion, as long as you realize this tablet's limitations (don't expect it to run photoshop, games, or other taxing activities), @150$, it is quite the steal."}

The second bad thing i encountered is that when i ordered 2 of the tablets, one of them was defective - it's network adapter stopped working after the third start of the tablet. The guys from Amazon helped me greatl and resolved the case though, but it still left a bad impression - i've expected more from HP."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "Very nice device for it's price. Pros: all you know and suppose :-) Good materials, look and feel, performance in Modern apps. Handy size for taking it everywhere.\nCons:\n1. Too little RAM. Although it is enough fow most Modern apps, it becomes pain when you start classic Outlook or any other Office program. Do not fool yourself - it is just a tablet for Modern apps. Using it for desktop apps and even old games is bad experience. In case of emergency, of course, you can reboot, open just one picture in, say Corel DRAW, make minor edit and save. But you cannot really work on desktop mode. Period. Screen is too small, programs are hardly usable in touch. And no keyboard.\n2. Very little battery time. Charge it overnight, take wilth you at work, keep it connected to Wi-Fi and syncing, 40-80 minutes of interaction during the day - and it is hearly half discharged by the end of day.\n3. Sometimes Wi-Fi stops working and even doe not connect to networks. Hope it is a software/firmware issue, and HP would fix it with updates soon.\n\nSo, if you have PC, laptop, big tablet and a smartphone, and need a device with larger screen to take everyhere with a smartphone - it is a good chioce. But it would not be a decent replacement to any of it (PC, laptop, big tablet, smartphone)."}

Good quality for its price.\nI know everyone wants to compare their tablets but from building pcs and repairing tech for 15 years I can tell you, you can't compare.

The 1gig of ram also is a major let down. HP I so would've paid a few extra bucks for a upgraded 2gig version but kudos for being cost friendly.\n\nWith that being said its a pretty solid buy of course its not gonna run as good as its more pricier competitors it doesn't take a comparison or rocket science to figure that out.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "This is for the 8\" tablet with 4G. I've just had it for a few days, but so far I think it really does what it's supposed to do. Hardware wise, the specs are obviously low end but it has what it needs.\n\nFirst: the build is solid and unassuming. A bit heavier than the sexier and more expensive tablets, but the plastic build feels solid, durable, and grippy enough  which (combined with the price) means I have no problem using this without a case. With a more expensive tablet I would feel obligated to use a case, so the weight advantage would be negated.\n\nThe screen is bright, has excellent viewing angles, and vibrant colors. It suffers from pronounced backlight bleed around the edges, however. This is most noticeable with a black screen, but even with a white screen you will notice it. This is the main reason I knocked off one star. I still think the screen is pretty good for the price, however. If you have used more high end tablets with high resolution screens, you will notice the lack of pixels on this screen particularly with text (using it as an e-reader for example). But it's really a fairly fine distinction, for all intents and purposes the screen is very nice and plenty sharp, perfect for web browsing and video watching. You will probably want to pick up a capacitive stylus because using Windows desktop mode on an 8\" screen can be a bit finicky using fingers. But the touch accuracy and sensitivity is as good as you can expect, all told I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe T-Mobile 4G is a real draw for this tablet. Keep in mind, T-Mobile basically gives away the free 200mb per month to anybody who buys a $10 SIM card. So it's not exactly an exclusive offer. But they do throw in the SIM card with this device, and it's hard to find reasonably priced tablets that have any cellular capability at all, so this is a rare beast. Having the SIM card slot also means you can buy prepaid data SIM's (which I do frequently when I travel internationally) and have internet everywhere you go. A nice feature.\n\nThis does have a built in GPS, a rarity among Windows tablets. Keep in mind there are precious few proper turn by turn navigation apps for Windows, the included \"Bing Maps\" gives directions but not turn by turn navigation.\n\nIt does not have any way to export video to a separate monitor or TV, unless you buy a Miracast dongle (I don't have one and don't care, I can export video from my Android phone via MHL if I need that feature on the road).\n\nIt does not have a USB port. You can use a microUSB \"OTG\" adapter instead, but you cannot charge the device and use the USB at the same time. Again, for me, don't really care.\n\nIt has a front and rear camera. They work, but are low end. Chances are the camera in your phone is 10 times better.\n\nPerformance wise, I place modest demands on the tablet, and it seems to handle everything smoothly. I was worried the 1GB ram would be a problem, but so long as I keep a reasonable limit on the number of tabs and programs I have open it seems OK. This is not the device for video editing or other demanding tasks.\n\nI have a 128GB microSD card in it, no problem there. It plays movies smoothly, and having real Windows 8 means there is no problem with weird formats or codecs. I got about 6.5 hours on the battery watching movies at 50% brightness, which isn't setting any records but you should ask yourself how many hours in a day you want to spend staring at an 8\" screen anyway.\n\nA lot has been said about Windows 8 vs. Android vs. iPad. I will try not to rehash the arguments, but simply say if you have an occasional use for legacy Windows programs (which I do) then this is a godsend. Combined with a bluetooth keyboard, It really allows me to ditch the laptop. It's not as good of a \"tablet ecosystem\" as iPad or Android nor is it as good of a computer as a proper laptop but it does work for all the tablet functions and all the laptop functions I need for a fraction of the cost, weight, and volume. This is coming from someone who spends half his life on the road travelling, but who's work is not particularly computer intensive (Although some proprietary and ancient scheduling software I occasionally need is Windows only). Mostly I just need to email, check facebook, watch movies, read books. Basic tablet stuff. This fits the bill, and thus far it delivers on what it promises.\n\nUPDATE: Some folks have complained about odd background noise using headphones. I can confirm that there is some electrical interference noise. It's not very loud, and not very noticeable when something is playing, but it is there. Might be a deal-breaker for some.\n\nAlso, some folks have noticed that the \"autohide\" taskbar in desktop mode doesn't unhide using touch. I can confirm this as well. The solution is simply not to use auto-hide, or there may be some other workarounds. Some google research reveals that this is a common problem with Windows 8.1 on other tablets as well. Hopefully this will be fixed by a future update since it appears to be a simple software issue.\n\nI found a free software \"Mapfactor Navigator Free\" which uses the free, worldwide openstreetmap project maps and provides free, offline, turn by turn navigation. A bit clunky, but it works with the internal GPS, which is nice."}

Apps-wise, it doesn't have any of the games I play (clash of clans, game of war, wartunes) nor does it play the java-based browser games I do on my PC (Drakensang). I know that for Drakensang, this tablet probably would not be great for game play anyway since the screen is small, but as a game addict, it'd have been nice to be able to just bring this when I am on a trip and log-in daily for my bonuses.\n\nMy husband is a big time TV guy (surprise surprise...) and he has been trying to customize his new android TV and new smart TV for weeks.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "out of box - upon checking the sound with ear buds, I'm finding it to have a strange hiss/ static sound. Tried it with two ear buds that both sound fine when using with my laptop. Have tried it with videos on web, music from \"Google Play\" and a movie playing from an external HDD. Sound is messed up with all three options. May have to send back. Other than sound issue, system has performed ok. there was one unexpected crash right in the beginning of use but after the system initiated some BIOS update something-or-other (it fixed itself) it performed fine. I like that the OS system is microsoft and one I'm familiar with and can find my way around the system. Also transferring stuff from a notebook is easy due to it's OS being a familiar one. The apps do take some time to figure out (like any new piece of tech but most have been quite intuitive to an average user of tech.) and i have not found any reason to write bad of.\n\nUPDATE DEC. 25: upon further use of this device, i am lowering my stars to 2. The sound issue has become more pronounced, making it a real test in patience when using with a head phone. Additionally,the Wifi connection has become sporadic, at times just dropping the connection. During these times, all other devices (computers, and handheld) were connected and working, so even to my decidedly very basic understanding of networks and wireless systems the fault lay with the Hp stream. (Other devices were tested in the same room.) After having this annoying issue come up a number of times, I re-reviewed amazon reviews to see if others had had the same issues. Lo & behold, (Not To My Surprise) the \"3 stars\" and-below reviews were full of these specific problems. It appears as if these major issues are not as sporadic or as \"an unfortunate flux\" as Hp corporate would want you to believe.\n\nThough there are many things about this device that I was initially quite enthusiastic about (specifically the native windows Os, the 4G capability and the 8 inch size) I have been quite let down with the end user results. Will be returning to Amazon (and not bothering with calling Hp customer support -it was an amazon fulfilled order) as upon reading one of the 'low starred' user's account of his attempting to use Hp customer support (replete with non-native English speaking reps, of which I have a very hard = exasperating time with, [though I would be most interested in making their acquaintance during any other social functions,] plus REPEATED 'run arounds,' of 25-50! min. wait times) I've decided of a less painful way to depart when My Time comes.\n\nCons: very noticeable static/ hissing noise when using the headphone jack;(doesn't matter what you're playing from: internal memory, streaming from web, connected to external device: flash drive/hdd) A sporadic working of the Wifi connection; a short and quick battery drain (relative to other tablets).\n\nIf buying: keep in mind that this may cause you a higher blood pressure and frequent visits to your local therapist, where you will probably lose the internet connection you were using to write out your review for the Hp stream.\n\nsigned,\na very disappointed - at being disappointed - guinea pig"}

My 7 does this too but not as bad, hopefully the BIOS update will help.  I am returning the 8 and giving the Stream 7 I bought to my grandmother to play with.  She will probably play with it once or twice then throw in a pile junk -- where these tablets belong."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "If you bought a the first generation iPad Mini in Nov-Dec 2014 - you'd get a non retina display, 16 GB Wi-Fi model for $ 199 - $ 249, depending on how good a deal hunter you are. This tablet has a 4G (not LTE!) capability, 32 GB (available memory 18 GB) and a SD card slot which accepted my 64 GB SDXC (Samsung) card graciously. So for less than iPad mini's price - I have almost 80 GB of free memory to do as I please, whereas in the iPad the available memory to me would have been 12-13 GB. I have already activated the T-mobile 4G connection, and I was quite happy with how fast it was. Enough to get work done. So, for me, I love the value this tablet is offering. But I rated it 4 star (probably would have given 3.5 if it was possible) because of its limitations.\n\nPros of the device (HP Stream 8) - See images uploaded:\n1) Storage - comes with 32 GB (around 18 GB available to you) + expandable - I put a 64 GB (58.5 available) SDXC card\n2) Price - $ 179 for 4G enabled tablet\n3) Screen is IPS - most cheaper android tablets are not. 1280 x 800 isn't the highest resolution but gets your work done.\n4) Decent build quality - should last\n5) USB \"On the go\" capability - with a $ 8- $ 10 OTG cable, you can convert the micro USB port into a full size USB to attach keyboard or mouse, or a powered hub to attach other devices.\n\nPros of the Operating System (you will get these pros on this device, but also on other tablets running win 8.1)\n1) Runs Win 8.1 - this is a mini computer, with a complete desktop mode, my computer, control panel and like - what that means for you is that say you want to install any non power intensive traditional windows program (e.g., VLC player) or want the familiarity which you have with your work or home computer, you can switch to desktop mode and enjoy it. This is not Win 8.1 RT - which you should run away from!\n2) Quality free apps - remember Microsoft is no Blackberry/RIM (I also bought a playbook by those people and they stopped supporting it just one year down the line). Microsoft creates quality software, and in their app store, they have provided plenty of free quality apps. The home screen layout is beautiful with live tiles refreshing itself.\n\nCons of the device (HP Stream 8):\n1) Plasticity feel due to back cover - no where as premium as an iPad, or a galaxy note's synthetic back\n2) SD card is below removable cover, which you need to remove extra carefully - so clearly you can't keep swapping cards\n3) No mini HDMI out\n4) Just 1 GB ram - it doesn't impact the win 8.1 apps from store, but if you run intensive programs in desktop mode, they will run slow or not at all\n5) Just one micro USB port which you need to use for charging as well as OTG (connecting keyboard, mouse etc.) So you can either charge the device or use a keyboard/mouse.\n6) Sleep mode isn't sleep mode. 80% charge, put it to sleep - next morning its dead. That does not happen with my win 8.1 computer, iPad or even blackberry playbook. Also, unlike an android tablet or iPad's sleep mode, where some apps keep refreshing and give you notifications when needed, when this tablet will sleep, it will really sleep (as good as shutdown)\n7) The screen is a finger print magnet - more than any iPad - it does not have oleo-phobic coating\n8) Screen's glass has a sticky feel to it. Its weird but I have never felt that way with other tablets/screens.\n9) Battery life is only 4 hours with a good brightness (which you enjoy) and 5 hours max with dim lighting (you'll hate it!)\n\nCons of the Operating System (you will get these cons on this device, but also on other tablets running win 8.1)\n1) Very very very few apps - no subway surfer, just one angry birds (that too paid), and almost no google ecosystem apps. If you are buying the tablet mainly for apps (e.g., online banking etc) then you will be very disappointed.\n2) The desktop mode is a great plus, but to be honest it is tough to use with a touchscreen - press and hold for options and then use your pinky finger and hope you clicked the right option.\n\nOther thoughts:\n1) Invest in a Bluetooth keyboard like Logitech K810 and bluetooth mouse like Logitech T630 - these devices can support multiple tablets/computers and then you can really enjoy this tablet for the hybrid it is.\n2) There was a problem with my order but Amazon was wonderful. Assuming amazon's price is competitive (I would say even if it is a little bit more) but it from them because the peace of mind is worth it!"}

More storage and better screen resolution than the Toshiba Excite 7 for about the same price.  Comes with Skype preinstalled.  Boots quickly.  I don't like Windows 8 the Metro Tiles \"Modern UI\" on a traditional desktop computer, but it seems to work ok on a tablet.  I installed the 'normal' 32 bit Windows versions of Firefox, Java, Citrix Receiver and Stellarium.  These ran just fine, but they are not optimized for the \"Modern UI\".  Stellarium had a few problems because there was no keyboard or mouse for example.  The Microsoft store has apps that are optimized for the \"Modern UI\" but most of them are not FREE like Android apps.  Games like Angry Birds cost $2-3 for example.  I did not try using Office 365 yet, but I'm not sure how well it will work on a 7 inch screen with no keyboard or mouse.  The screen is my biggest complaint with this device.  The text is very small and hard to read on a 7 inch screen.  I was able to make the text bigger, but it's still kind of small.  I think the 8 inch version of this tablet would be better.  Android seems to be more optimized for small screens than Windows 8.\n\nUpdate:  Battery life isn't great.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I just got it today, but having read the reviews about the possibility of updates crippling the tablet, I changed the settings from auto install updates to allowing me to select when to install.  I'm hoping that in a few months time whatever the problem is will be solved.  So far set up has been easy, as has been installing office.  I used the Search feature from the Charms bar to find Office and activated then downloaded and installed it.  It felt a bit chunky and heavy, I guess rounded and tapered corners do make a difference.  Battery life seems better than my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 but still isn't that wonderful.  I changed the battery saving setting so that it will shut off when battery levels get low.  You get something like 25gb from Dropbox for 6 months, plus if you sign up/in from OneDrive you can get 1 Tb free.  You also get 60 minutes of Skype free per month.\n\nMy gripes so far are that sometimes the keyboard pops up when you are filling in fields, but at others it doesn't you have to select it and it then blocks out part of what you are filling in on screen; the screen isn't super responsive to touches - I can see that my finger has touched the screen (small circles \"swimming out\" from the spot I touch) but I have to keep pressing to get a response, particularly at the top of the screen; I tried the beta function of connecting to a wireless display, in this case the roku 3 and it initiated but then failed to connect; for some reason I couldn't connect it to my homegroup, and at one point I couldn't see it on my network, even though it had Internet access, made me wonder if the Wifi was being dropped.  I changed the workgroup name and that seemed to work to allow me to access the homegroup I'd created on a Windows 7 laptop. The screen is small compared to the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and the fonts are small.  I have it set to medium size for display but that is still small on screen.  For some reason, Microsoft has decided that when you call someone on Skype you don't want to hear that it is ringing so they lower the sound, and it's the same on the tablet but the sound is so low that if there is background noise you won't hear it, you can only look at the pulsing of the Skype symbol.  I wasn't able to make contact with anyone on Skype so can't say how that works.\n\nI connected a bluetooth keyboard (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FVUZQ5S/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which I had bought for a Samsung tablet and that's working fine. I've ordered a case (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K6322FC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) but haven't got it yet.  I'm waiting for more reviews of the Infiland keyboard cases before I buy one.  I put in a Samsung Class 10 32gb sd card (didn't format it) and it detected it.\n\nOver all it seems a decent tablet for the price, especially if you use it with a bluetooth keyboard which makes it easier to fill in forms, work on Office documents etc."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I recently purchased the HP Stream 7 from Amazon. At the time I purchased, it was $99, but I notice that the price has gone up by a little over twenty bucks since then. I'm going to describe my experience with the Stream 7 in comparison to the various other tablet devices I am familiar with. I currently use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 on a daily basis, as well as an iPad 2 which I use mostly for email and media streaming. In addition, I own a Nexus 7 (2013) that was in daily use until I sat on it and cracked the screen. My comparison is mainly based on my Nexus 7 experience, as the screen sizes are more similar than the other devices.\n\nWhen I was shopping for a Nexus 7 replacement I ran across the Stream 7 for $99. I was impressed by the fact that I could get a tablet with the complete Windows 8.1 OS for such a low price and decided it would be worth taking a shot at it, especially since it comes with a year's worth of Office 365. The Office 365 license includes a license for another computer in addition to the Stream 7, so it was basically as though I was paying an extra $30 over the Office 365 subscription price to get the tablet. This math doesn't really apply if you don't plan to use the Office suite of software, of course. This is a sensational $30 device but is a more dubious value for $99, much less the current $123 price.\n\nFirst, the good stuff. This is a full Windows 8.1 computer that fits in your pocket. That is pretty cool, indeed. You can load apps from the default app store as well as downloading and installing software as you would with any Windows computer. I was able to load a variety of free apps including photo editing software, games, the Office 2013 software (as part of the Office 365 subscription), and other software from a variety of websites. Everything I tried to install ran, although I did have some problems with the Windows 8.1 user interface that are not related to the device itself, other than the fact that Microsoft seems to have some problems with understanding how people are going to try to interact with the 7\" screen (more on that later in this review).\n\nUpon initial setup you are prompted to supply your Microsoft user credentials so that everything will synchronize with your other devices in the cloud. Frankly, I don't think that Microsoft does as seamless a job of this as Google, but that is my personal opinion. You do have the option of using a local account if you want to forego the cloud features. Once you've supplied the required information, the computer will finish the setup automatically. This took about 10-15 minutes on my home network. If you are already familiar with Windows 8.1 you shouldn't have much trouble getting used to the user experience. In my case, I had to spend a while getting used to the differences between Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. Once I figured out the various gestures to navigate among screens it wasn't too hard to get going. That's where I started to run into some things that I found really frustrating.\n\nThe screen resolution on the Stream 7 is 1280 x 800, as opposed to 1920 x 1200 for the Nexus 7. That is a pretty big difference when you are trying to read text or trying to view a busy web page. Although you can zoom in and out with gestures, the Stream didn't seem to respond as well to pinching in and out as the Nexus 7. The screen is OK for looking at pictures, but still not as good as the higher resolution Nexus 7. To add to the general frustration with the screen resolution, the graphics drivers from Microsoft don't seem to work very well at rendering web pages that require scrolling back and forth. Ironically, this includes the Stream 7 page at the Hp website. I had to turn the tablet sideways to read a lot of pages that work just fine on my other devices in portrait mode, which was pretty annoying. I'm not sure whether this is a Microsoft problem or an HP problem, to be fair.\n\nBattery life is another area where this device seemed to suffer. If I turned the device on and then left it alone for a while, the battery would go dead pretty quickly (someplace between 3 and 5 hours, I would guess). If I used it to do stuff like check email and browse the Internet it would die even more quickly. I did some research and found that this is partially caused by a feature called Connected Standby that allows the tablet to receive notifications from Skype, Facebook, and other applications when it is turned off due to inactivity. Microsoft doesn't provide a way to turn the feature off, but I was able to find a way to edit the registry to deactivate it. That dramatically improved the battery life, but it also made it take much longer for the device to wake up after standby. With Connected Standby enabled, the device will wake up almost instantly. With the feature disabled it takes something more in the order of 30 seconds. I'd prefer that there be a simple way to turn it on and off. By way of comparison, the Nexus 7 and the other devices all handle standby mode better, have power settings that are easier to configure, and have better battery life.\n\nI didn't try using an external keyboard with the Stream 7. The on-screen keyboard is OK, I guess, but I really missed the Swype-style keyboard on the Nexus 7. I'm not sure why this isn't baked into the device, but it really should be. This is a matter of personal preference, but it is something I have mentioned to everyone that I've talked to about the device.\n\nThe other thing that is worthy of mention is that the side of the case is oddly shaped. The back is slightly wider than the front, which makes it easy to grasp when you are holding it. The problem is, it also makes it awkward to pick it up when it's sitting on a flat surface. This might be less noticeable with a case.\n\nTo summarize, I really want to be able to say that this tablet is a great value. I'm impressed that Windows can fit on it and be usable. I like the fact that it comes with a year's worth of Office. However, I'm disappointed with the way text is rendered by Windows and with the Windows 8.1 interface, in general. I intend to upgrade it to Windows 10 as soon as I can, in hope that some of my frustrations will be resolved by the developers at Microsoft. Until Windows works better on the Stream 7, I can't really give the device more than a 3-star review for MY needs. For $99 it might be worth playing with, but if the price is any higher than $99 you'd probably be best served with a good Android tablet or an iPad mini (if you can find one on sale)."}

The screen is actually pretty good, only some backlight bleed. I do wish it was a bit lighter, but then you're getting into the 6\" Lumia 1525's world and that's considerably more expensive. I haven't put in a micro SD card yet, but I've heard it will take 64G models, with the holiday sales you should be able to get one for $25 or so. You can also point the Stream's libraries to your homegroup's shared music, pictures, and videos if you don't want to splurge for the local storage.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "SO I have had this tablet for 3 days now.  Understandably, three days is not nearly enough time to test all of the aspects of the tablet but it is more than enough time to get an idea of what to expect.  With that in mind, here goes:\n\nCONS\n\n1. Not enough hard drive capacity: I reinitialized the tablet three times to see if I could get the hard drive capacity to increase but it is pretty steady that you will only get between 19-20 GB out of the 32 GB at start up.  I can't find a reason for the differing amount (mines ranged from 19.6 to 20.3) but I guess that is dependent on what programs are activated at start up.  Also, it appears that the drive amount steadily decreases (with me adding nothing new) to about 14-16 GB as the tablets stays on.  I have searched the drive and can't find any particular reason for this as the drive consistently only shows a total of 12-14 GB  being used on the C drive.  I have not been able to locate where the other 5-7 GB is going.  Safe bets would be to only count on 10-15 being available eventually as I am chalking the discrepancy up to app storage and updates that, for some reason, are not showing up on the C drive.\n\n2. Screen bleed: Light leaks around the edges of this screen like crazy.  I would imagine that this is one of the areas where HP had to cut corners in order to keep the tablet in the targeted price range.  It's by no means a deal breaker (as many tablets and back-lit TV's have screen bleed) but something to consider if you're planning on watching a lot of video in the dark or reading a lot in in dark or low light areas.\n\n3. Charging: The charger for this tablet is TERRIBLE.  I routinely leave it plugged in for an hour and it gets only about 10-15 percent more charged.  it takes well over 5 hours to get a full charge if the tablet is below 10%.  I would say this is a cost cutting measure too but chargers are relatively cheap so this is more of a laziness issue or something that HP just simply didn't put a lot of effort into.  I imagine some of it has to do with the fact that this is a full fledged Windows OS device  that is trying to charge off of a micro USP port.  Windows is far more of an energy hog than Android.\n\n4. Touch screen sensitivity: The touch screen can be finicky at times and, in my observation, only really occurs either in the desktop mode or with the IE Explorer on the tablet side.  Not completely sure why that would be the case when it works fine everywhere else but I know at least part of it is related to the fact that the screen only supports 5-touch multi-point instead of the more widely used 10-touch multi-point.  That said, this isn't a deal breaker either as the screen, overall, works just fine. Just be aware that in some screens (particularly the aforementioned ones) you will need to be more precise than you normally would have to be.\n\nOn-Screen Keyboard: In desktop mode, be aware that the on-screen keyboard does not pop up automatically when you press in an editable field like the navigation or address bar or even a document. You have to manually select it from the task bar tray and there appears t be no way to make it automatic from the desktop.  In tile mode and everywhere else it works just fine.\n\nApp store: There are a LOT of apps missing from the Microsoft app store that are commonplace in the Apple App store and Google App store (like Groupon).  Additionally, some of the ones that are there are not free as they are in the other app stores (like XFinity Live).  That said, since this is basically a handheld computer, you can access the actual websites of any of the apps as you would on a laptop or desktop.  Where this will hurt you mostly is games as popular and well known games such as Temple Run and Candy Crush simply don't exist on Microsoft's App store.  Don't get me wrong though, there are a lot of games (good games actually) on their app store... just not ones you're used to seeing.\n\nNow, with that out of the way, here is what everybody came to read... the Pros!\n\nPROS\n\nFull Fledged Windows 8.1:  This is not a watered down version or even modified (like Windows RT) but is, in fact, the complete Windows 8.1 operating system.  I have delved into the innermost parts of the program and found nothing lacking.  It is all there.  Even a partitioned amount for a recovery which also may help to explain the missing GB from my earlier comments. In theory, whatever you can do on a laptop or desktop should be feasible on this tablet with reasonable limitations of course.  Interestingly, those limitations won't likely come as a result of the processor or 1GB RAM.  Speaking of which...\n\nIntel Atom Z3735G Processor/Performance: This is one of the newest chips that Intel has put out (came out in May 2014) and while not expensive, it does carry the Intel torch like a champ and does nothing to tarnish the \"Intel Inside\" legacy.  The chip provides a snappy response no matter what you are doing and I have not experienced any lags of any sort save but one (more on that in a minute).  Keep in mind that I am TRYING to cause problems with the tablet up front.  It's what I do because I will return a device (especially tablets, Laptops, and desktops) if they can't do what i need them to do.  To that end, I have opened a maximum of 6 web pages and had 3 other apps going without a problem which I believe is more than what most people will do.  Go more than that and the chip struggles and will, in fact, give you the dreaded \"page/system/program not responding) box that is common to PC's.  In short, keep it moderate and you should be alright. This is not a power user's device.  And in regards to the one issue with lag, it is in the screen rotation.  There is an obvious and prolonged delay in changing the rotation (1-2 seconds).  Given the responsiveness elsewhere, I have no choice but to assume that this is a Windows 8.1 issue and not a hardware issue as the chip powers through just about everything else. If it is really annoying to you though, you do have the option of locking the screen into one orientation.  Mine is locked into landscape mode. In any case, I have owned several \"Intel Atom\" devices and, in my experience, performance has never been an issue with them.  It looks like the HP Stream 8 is more of the same.\n\nScreen:  Yes the screen makes it onto the Pros side of things too and rightfully so.  It is sharp, bright, and responsive (given the previous issue I discussed).  It is noticeably HD contrary to what others have stated.  I have downloaded a number of HD pictures and videos and they have looked and played just fine.  While it is a fingerprint, smudge, and dirt magnet, I don't know many tablets that aren't so it doesn't get a strike on that.  The only other minor issue is the lack of auto brightness as a feature.  Again though, when you consider what you have (a laptop in PC form) it is acceptable as it is no different form it's PC counterparts so again, no strike is given.\n\nSoftware: Full Microsoft Windows 8.1? Check. Office 360 free for a year? Check. Connected HP cloud backup services? Check. Free Dropbox storage? Check.  Free monthly Skype allotment? Check. The ability to download and run ANY other software that your Windows laptop or desktop can run? Double check! In fact, this last one is pretty much the one thing that this tablet can do that no other tablet in it's class or price range (Android, Windows, or otherwise) can do which makes it an attractive device.  There are other 8 inch WinMo 8.1 tablets (like the Dell Pro and Toshiba Encore) but they go for $80 to $100 more than this one.  And Given that I got this on sale at $139 (down from its normal price of $179), that made it even more of a value.  Throw in the fact that there is no bloatware to be found (unless you consider the HP Connected app and Dropbox bloatware), the tablet comes ready to get to get down to business and optimized right out of the box.\n\nBuild Quality: It is heavy.  Not overbearingly so but it is heavier than similarly sized tablets.  In fact, in hand, it weighs only slightly less than my 10 inch android Asus TF300T Transformer tablet. Other than weight though, the dimensions make it a quite palatable device for holding with one hand  though, admittedly, small hands might still have a problem with doing so.  And while the entire construct is plastic, it is solidly built with no gaps edges or wayward crevices to be found. The battery cover seals tightly and as evidence of its tightness, it requires mild effort to take off or snap back on. Not difficult mind you but definitely requiring more effort than what I was used to having used plastic phones like those in the Galaxy line. The screen is so tight in fact that it looks like I could pour water on it and it wouldn't seep through.  This is where the heritage and benefits of buying tablets from an actual PC maker really show.  This also makes the screen bleed issue even more befuddling since it is obvious that HP put a lot of effort into the construction of this tablet.  Aside from that, there is a minimalist approach to the tablet with it having only two physical bottoms (volume and power and one capacitive one.  A single micro USB port and headphone jack is the only other thing you will find on the tablet.  The sim card and SD card storage are behind the back cover which, actually, is refreshing for me. I don't know how many times I lost SD cards because I (or my kids) have inadvertently ejected them either because they had no cover or the cover was flimsy.  That said, HP is banking on the fact that you will not be removing that SD card because of the low storage amount provided with the tablet. I have a supplemental 16GB card in mine and I don't plan on taking it out or using it up anytime soon.\n\nFeatures: Screen projection works.  You need only connect to a wireless TV or to a an adapter connected to a regular TV and, voila... your screen will be projected.  I used the Belkin\nBelkin Miracast Video Adapter that is sold on Amazon for $59.99. As a side note, that adapter works with just about any Miracast enabled device including my Asus tablet and LG G3 smartphone.  Moving on, I am thoroughly impressed with the Outlook app.  if you are familiar with the new GMail app that allows you to add any email account, it is similar to that but way more refined with a better layout and intuitive usability.  I have four email accounts setup (the one mandatory Outlook one of course) and it does a stellar job of sorting, providing notifications, and previewing those emails.  In fact, just about every standard app has a gorgeous design and layout.  I suppose I have looked at stretched out tablet sized phone apps on android tablets for so long that I'd grown used to blank spaces and unusable space.  Not so with Microsoft.  these app were designed for PC and Tablet consumption and it shows.  So much so that I have stuck to the native weather, news, and photo apps of Microsoft.  And this was after downloading my usual ones from the Microsoft App store (Weatherbug, Flipboard, VLC Player).  Even my beloved Flipboard didn't look as good as the native news app (though Flipboard looks very good on this tablet).  To that end, all of the usual suspects are available on this tablet that would be available on your PC (Media Player, Paint, Office, IE Explorer) and just like how you wouldn't sub out many of those programs and services on your PC, you won't be inclined to do so on this tablet either.  On a side note the IE explorer app (different from the desktop IE Explorer that is on the tablet) is very good and very fast.\n\n4G: This is THE aspect that pushed this tablet over the edge and among the primary reasons I am taking the jump from android tablets to Windows tablet.  There are not many tablets in general with 4G connectivity that are inexpensive and even fewer than run full Windows and/or were compatible with TMobile's network.  I was looking at the Galaxy Tab 4 8.0 with 4G (which retails currently for $299) and, after that, I had to make the jump to a 10 inch tablet which I was trying to avoid for portability reasons.  I consider 7 inch tablets to be too small especially considering that my G# smartphone has a 5.5 inch screen. I was all ready to buy the Tab when this tablet came out and, given the price, it was exactly where I thought it should be spec-wise with two exceptions: 4G and full Windows 8.1.  Unheard of.  At $179, I was willing to take a chance and when the price dropped to $139 for their lighting sale, there was no way I could pass up the chance to see if it worked.  To that end, the tablet comes with 200MB of 4G data for life for free.  Nice to know and I will keep that in mind but I pooped in my TMobile data which comes with 5GB monthly and it has worked just fine.  Given that I have it set to connect primarily with WiFi even when the 4G data is on, I don't anticipate that I will ever get to the 5GB limit unless WiFi catastrophically fails everywhere.  In any case, the 4G has often been the faster connection no matter what WiFi I have been on but I am in a big city (Houston) so I have very good and expansive 4G coverage.  This may not be true for everyone.\n\nSummary\n\nAll in all, I would say that this tablet is as good a value as it comes especially if you were able to pick one up during the lightning sale when it was $139.  So far it has performed well but I intend to update this review later after more substantial time has passed.  I would also caution against those that use tablets for gaming or extreme media consumption as this tablet is not designed with that in mind.  Think of it as a more portable and usable netbook which was the small laptops that died an untimely death BECAUSE of tablets.  And just like those netbooks were designed more for reading, document editing, and an overall portable PC device for students and business people, this tablet is designed for the same people.  That said, it can definitely handle media consumption as evidenced by the fact that I bookmarked the actual Hulu site and watched movies and episodes from there without problems.  Music, of course, is no problem with Windows Media Player onboard as well as HP's music app (which can be uninstalled).  The bottom line though is this: understand the device you have.  it is a PC first and a tablet second.  Where it has potential to shine is in document creation/editing, web browsing, reading, and music because these are the menial tasks that your PC usually handles.  This tablet is built to takeover those low level PC activities that you really don't want to start up your laptop or PC for while being ultra portable.  That's it.  If you want high media consumption, gaming, or are stuck on the app-centric android platform, then find yourself an android or Apple tablet that satisfies those needs.  But if, like me, you don't like firing up your laptop JUST to open/edit/create a document, listen to music, get a little real work done (on a platform just as stable as your laptop) but don't need the bells and whistles of an android tablet, this is your tablet.  I don't know that I would ever spend the requisite minimum $500 for a Surface tablet but I think that if this tablet is a success, you will likely see better spec'd full Windows tablets in the near future to start stealing away the average android and apple tablet users that do schoolwork or business.  While I have no problem creating and editing doc on Docs to Go on my android Asus tablet, as a business professional, it is quite refreshing to open up a spreadsheet and find the same options and editing tools that I have on my PC (though, admittedly, I have not used it for work yet).  That familiarity to the average student and non-executive business worker (they can afford the Surface Pro) can mean a lot and with this tablet, HP is vying to find out just how much.  If that niche is there like I think it is, HP and Windows may have just hit a gold mine especially if the moderately spec'd tablet can perform reasonably and ably."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "Surprisingly mediocre effort by HP, when I first took it out of the box I was enamored with this $99 marvel.  I agree with other peoples first impressions with the device.  Runs full windows? Awesome! Small and light? Great! The screen? The screen is gorgeous.  I knew there would be some sacrifices like it having a significantly shorter battery life than most tablets, I was ok with that. However, two weeks in, now that the honey moon is over. I've really started to feel where HP cut corners to deliver the product. If you check the HP forums, there are tons of people with issues.\n\nMy first issue is the charging situation, this bugger is picky as to which charger lets it charge to 100%, every charger you plug in works for a little bit then it stops. Unless you use the official HP charger & cable... which as of this writing they don't sell in the US store, so if you need a spare you're SOL. To add insult to injury, HP in their wisdom has elected to not put in a charge indicator on the device, so to check the charge you have to turn the device on, navigate to your desktop and check the taskbar icon because the battery indicator in the windows modern UI doesn't give you percentages.\n\nNext Wifi keeps dropping and that's related to the current software drivers (hopefully), I've resorted to using a USB wifi dongle attached via the OTG port when I need to do things where I won't get disconnected. I think for most people, they'll think the wifi drops are just slow internet, but when you're VPN'ed into work and the bugger disconnects your VPN every few minutes, it's hecka noticeable (and I have tried it from many different Wifi networks where my (full sized) laptop has had no issues).\n\nThird there is that as I like to call it, \"touch sensor, audible biofeedback,\" the headphone buzzing other people mention? It gets louder and softer, depending on if you're touching the screen or dragging your finger across it. HP actually told me that I shouldn't experience this issue if I were to switch to bluetooth headphones, which is true but is beside the point.\n\nRemember how I said I didn't mind the short battery life? Well, yes but, here's the thing you have to remember, this isn't a true tablet like an ipad or nexus, it is a computer without a keyboard. What does that mean? Unlike other device, when you hit the power button those devices actually stop using battery however, the stream 7 is different. Even when you think your device is sleeping, it could be awake running something in the background killing your battery. I've had more than once, put the device to sleep, gone to run a task and come back to a super hot & drained device, because some app didn't let the system go all the way to sleep. Once it was windows media sharing that did that, heck that's a MS program! Normal issue of a laptop/desktop, kinda of something that throws you when you're dealing with a tablet.\n\nNow negatives aside, here is what I do like, I like the USB OTG so far as long as it isn't a high powered device like a hard drive, I've been able to plug it in and use it. From a wired ethernet adapter, 4G LTE modem, USB memory card readers, and USB biometric readers; as well as the aforementioned USB wifi dongle. As i've said the screen is gorgeous and is bright, I have no problems using it outdoors at my local starbucks and it gets dim enough that I can read a kindle book in bed. I love being able to run my normal windows applications, real office, real chrome, real VPN with real putty, on a tiny little device. I like a few of the media consumption apps like Hulu, Plex and netflix, which just work better in windows modern/metro mode than they do on the desktop (mostly).\n\nI'm still not sure this is a keeper, it feels like there are one too many sacrifices you have to accept to make it work. Granted it is early days for a lot of the components in this device, that with time & new drivers issues like the wifi drops will disappear. What I mean is, that the wifi component for example, was only released by the chip maker to manufacturers in Sept and drivers were in beta/pre-release until mid October.  If you aren't an early adopter, not a self troubleshooter, it might be best to leave this until version 2 comes out or at least until the drivers mature in 7 or 8 months."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I've always wanted a full Windows 8 powered tablet since the Surface tablets appeared, but since they're substantially expensive and the full Windows ones don't come with 4g connectivity I never bought one. This season HP came out with their string of Stream laptops and tablets it caught my attention. Obviously if money is a big constraint then stop reading now and buy Stream 7 for $99. Personally I've always found the 7\" a bit too small for my taste and with the added 1\" screen real estate, 4g and 200MB of lifetime data the $79 extra goes a long way. I also picked up a Samsung Evo 64GB micro SD card for $25 last week.\n\nCompare that to a 64/128 GB iPad mini with 4g connectivity and you immediately see how much more value for money this tablet is! To be fair you have to compare it to the older mini models, which you can buy from Apple refurb outlet for around $400, but still the HP is less than half the price. And the OS isn't merely an app launcher, its a full powered desktop OS with Office for a year and where you can pretty much run any consumer software without a lot of problems. I'm not a gamer so can't comment to that aspect, but I've used Excel and it works without much problems and I've Chrome opened now with 2 video tabs, 4 other tabs and this window where I'm writing the Amazon review on full website. All this with the customized Chrome signed in with all extensions and add-ons enabled. No stutter at all.\n\nOf course there are compromises and some problems, like the camera quality is poor (I don't use tablets for taking photos, but only for video chat), tablet gets hot when watching flash videos for an extended time, display barely qualifies as HD, RAM could've been 2GB, audio output jack produces some static/hissing noise, touch isn't 100% intuitive always etc. etc. However it satisfies my biggest needs, full Windows powered tablet, micro SD slot, micro SIM slot with 4g (no LTE) and under $200. I'm traveling now and is in Asia and didn't bring a laptop this time and will update the review as I spend more time. The battery has lasted for 5 hours, with 2 hours of video and the rest Excel and Chrome, and shows 40% remaining. So should get the 8 hours or so the HP specs claims. I recommend this tablet to anyone as a very viable (and most cases better) budget option to iOS and Android tablets.\n\nTyped on an HP Stream 8!\n\n-- Update Jan 2015 --\n\nNow that I've owned the tablet for more than a month I can add a few more things.\n1) The tablet is unlocked and can be used with any SIM card (GSM 3g/4g), this came in very handy while I was in Asia.\n2) The battery life is not great and lasts 4-6 hours depending on your use. The sleep function isn't exactly power saving and drains battery. I found closing all the apps/programs helps to some extend in this regard. Pull up all the apps that are open and drag them from the top bar all the way down to close it, alternatively you can also use the task manager and processes tab on it.\n3) Internet Explorer (with an ad-blocker) works better than Chrome, in terms of using less computing resources and power, even though I prefer Chrome because of the extensions/add-ons I have enabled on it.\n4) Most HD videos play flawlessly, upto 720p (I use VLC metro app) and the tablet can get hot/laggy if you want to play 1080p full HD via Chrome.\n5) Update your drivers from the HP website and remove unwanted bloatware (to be honest there is very less bloatware on this machine).\n6) Amazon refunded me $30 when they slashed the price to $149, now it has gone back up to $179.\n\nAll said, for $150 bucks you'd be hard pressed to find another tablet with similar specs. Still 5-star despite the negatives."}

I have not had any of the troubles with Windows updates like others have mentioned.  It runs fast enough for Windows Store games, word processing, and also very well at internet surfing.  It only has 1gb of RAM, so trick is to just close out programs instead of letting them run in the background (swipe down from top Bezel onto your screen to close the program).  Also, buy an SD card so that you can load your regular programs onto that (unfortunately windows 8 apps will only go to the built in SSD, this will save you space and you can put all your word files, downloaded videos, etc onto the SD Card.  I am using a 64 GB card fine, even though it states it only uses 32 gb cards.  It comes with Office - I already have Office 365 family with 5 computers, so when I tried to authorize the Office personal it wouldn't let me as the subscription I have is better - but it did give me the office key to the personal version when it told me I couldn't switch, so I can install it later.  I bought an OTG cable, works great for flash drives and wireless keyboard/mouse.  I bought the HP OEM screen protector, works very well.  It is well made, overall I can't believe that this was only 99 dollars, pretty amazing.

For less than $200 you get a great 8\" screen, loads of storage (32GB with about 25GB available out of the box), free 4G connectivity, Microsoft Office for this device and your home PC, and a nicely designed package to boot. We have an iPad and a Kindle Reader and this is definitely chewing into time share on those devices. For me, the real killer is the free connectivity and the free Office... wow, we can finally have our kids stop bugging us for our phone when we are on the road and they can connect directly for their games and some quick video streams (though not too many because you only get 200MB each month free). The Office subscription is also great - its a year free so eventually we will have to choose to either pay to renew or go back to our old version of Office 2007 but its so nice to have a new modern UI and features like the animations in powerpoint... and not just on this device but our home PC as well.\n\nCons? The battery life is decent but not mind-blowing (a solid 7 hours for us). The device isn't as thin as our iPad or has nearly as many accessories (but it's also $150 cheaper...) and I wish there were more apps in the app store (there are a lot but a lot of the games my son likes that he can get on iOS aren't yet on Windows).\n\nBut for the price, the pros well out way the debits.

This is a common problem that nobody on the forum has been able to solve.\nMy wifi connection will be fine one minute and limited (No internet) the next. then it will do this back and forth dance (off & on) no matter what steps are taken to fix the issue.\n\nAnother big problem is battery life and charging, The tablet is a battery hog, no matter what you do the battery will seem to drain at far too rapid a rate even while sleep, and recharging takes an excessively long time.\n\nVery tiny sound from speaker, and using headphones will cause the tablet to produce a static type noise\n\nLight bleeds from the bottom of the screen and can be very distracting depending on what you are doing on the tablet.\n\nI know this is only 99 dollars, however some of these issues (mostly the network and battery issues) make this product unusable\nfor me.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I had no plans to buy a tablet but when I saw this in store, I could not resit it for the price it was offered. I spent good amount of time on it and was very happy. I sat continuously for 8-10 hrs and charged in between. It does everything what your powerful desktop does(but slow for big applications). I was very happy. I slept leaving the tablet on. Just after a minute the screen turned off and I thought it too went to sleep. I had almost 100% charge at that time. Morning when I tried to turn it on it showed a black screen with battery storage details and basically the battery was dead. So I charged fully and wanted to check if the battery is good, so this time I manually put the tablet in sleep. I had put all the power settings to low power options. And this morning I could not turn on the tablet. It was bit disappointing. For $100 it was worth the max but the battery life made it worse. I had bought 2 of these and returned one without opening and the other one I will use it for some more time and probably return it. Everything was good in this. May be the OS has to be optimized for better battery life/standby time. Also OS has to be optimized for such a small screen for touch interface because most of the left click controls were hard to manage. I tried 8inch tablet and it was better than the 7inch for the user touch interface. I can use it as a e-reader, for portable car entertainment system, browsing and as desktop system also. 7inch and 8inch has same number of pixels and hence the fonts on 7inch screen looks better and sharper than the 8inch. The price on the 8inch is 80% more than 7inch. Hope they will increase the resolution on the 8inch. Overall I feel 8inch is more touch user friendly for Windows OS. If anyone had same issues with the battery please leave a feedback as what you did. If there is any change that I could do to have longer stand by battery life."}

Black levels seem pretty gray.\nStill a little slow( compared to say an old Athlon X2 I have)\n\nOver all I was very happy with this tablet. A bit of a learning curve but I really love that with Windows you can run almost any program you need, but I don't have to download dozens of apps if I don't want to. The only app you really need on a tablet is a good web browser.\n\nUnfortunately, and this seems to be a common Windows 8 problem, connected standby does not work properly. Connected standby is a new feature so that Windows acts more like a phone. Instead of going to sleep when you leave it inactive or push the power button it enters this new connected standby state so your device can still receive emails etc while your not using it. I'd charge my tablet before bed and the battery would be stone dead by morning every day. Had to return it and now I guess Ill just do without a tablet because I'm sick of problems with Android also."}

Well put together and more then powerful enough to handle basic PC tasks.  Works great with the default 8.1 Metro interface and all the Metro apps I have tried run without lag and open plenty quick.  Messed around with the classic desktop some- installed Steam, Dropbox, etc and the only issues I have run into there are with my fat fingers mashing the wrong icons (easily solved with a bluetooth mouse/keyboard).

Obviously the HDX is much more powerful, but on the other hand, I can't run Windows stuff on the Kindle...\n\nSince I have a gaming PC, my Steam is absolutely clogged with tons of low-spec Indie games I am DYING to try out.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I purchased this tablet on a whim, on Black Friday. It had decent reviews (for a $99 tablet) and came with Office 365, a $69.99 value. I told my friends on Facebook \"You really can't go wrong spending a hundred bucks for this.\" And then I installed some Windows updates and all heck broke loose.\n\nAfter installing updates that I was prompted for, the tablet would no longer boot to a functional state. It would boot, but once getting to the lock screen, nothing would work - the tablet would indicate that no network connection was available, the touch screen wouldn't work. Heck, it didn't even detect the tablet as having a battery! I attempted a System Reset followed by a System Recovery, accessed through the tablet's boot menu (hold down Volume Down and Power while turning it on) - neither of which was successful - error messages galore. I attempted several things through the command prompt and the use of an external keyboard - no avail. I attempted a clean install of Windows 8.1 using a USB drive and a \"USB On The Go\" cable - no drivers available through HP so that left it in a useless state. Also, no recovery software is available through HP's website (and I didn't see any way to make a recovery drive when the tablet was in a working condition) - the only way to get recovery software is to pay $40.00 plus shipping ($6.95)!!\n\nI called HP's support number, as posted on their website. The first non-native English speaker told me I would have to speak to another Department (after waiting on hold for 20 minutes). I was forwarded to that department to speak to another non-native English speaker that I could barely hear, who told me, after another 20 minute hold time, I would need to call the support number I initially called and speak to someone there. I called that number back, waited on hold another 25 minutes, gave the newest non-native English speaker my information and was once again told I needed to speak to another department.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting - I was forwarded to that department, waited on hold for 30 minutes and spoke to a gentleman named \"John\". At some point, John hung up on me and called me back several minutes later. After that call back, I was on hold for 50 minutes while John attempted to get his supervisor to authorize a replacement device. I got tired of waiting and hung up. John called my home phone back, at 10:50 at night, waking up my small child, just to tell me the supervisor would call the next day. I politely complained that the device is clearly defective and that other companies, after waiting for this long, would have just authorized a replacement, no questions asked (Apple once sent me a free replacement iPhone on an out-of-warranty device simply because they kept me waiting on hold for an hour). At this point, I initiated a return through Amazon.com for a defective product. The \"hardware supervisor\" never did call me, but I got several emails indicating they sent me a return kit for a replacement.\n\nNeedless to say, this is going back to Amazon.com today due to the product's defective nature (It couldn't handle a required update!) and HP's horrible customer support. You've lost a customer forever, HP."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "For the price, this is the best tablet out there.  Yeah, there are higher-powered tablets, and there are cheaper tablets, but this one hits the sweet spot.  Good size, full Windows 8.1, decent battery life (I've used it since it arrived five days ago, and have been getting 5-7 hours of life between charges.)  Even without the 4G or Office 365, it's a good value.\n\nWITH the free 4G for life and Office 365, it's a steal.  Note: You can eat through the 200 MB/month *FAST*, though.  I've only been using the 4G for a few hours, and have already used 1/4 of my monthly allotment.  I highly recommend using Windows 8.1's desktop Task Manager's \"App history\" tab to find what apps use the most data, and restrict them if you can.  200 MB is not enough for 'day to day use,' it is truly 'emergency use only' amount.  But if you need it, it will be a lifesaver.\n\nThe tablet itself is of good build quality, with good quality (although fingerprint-prone) plastic back that pops off easily to get to the micro SD slot and SIM slot.  The screen is VERY high quality, and with my not-perfect vision, just as easy on the eyes as an Apple \"Retina\" display.  If you have 20/20 or better, it should be just on the edge of \"can't see the pixels\" quality.  The cameras are of \"good enough for video chat\" quality, not going to replace even a mediocre dedicated camera, and video quality is likewise limited.  But usable for the primary purpose of video chat just fine.  Skype works in dim lighting just fine.\n\nThe CPU and GPU are fast enough for everything I've thrown at it, including some very complex Excel spreadsheets and some light gaming (Minecraft was playable, although I did have to reduce a few of the visual settings.)  The storage was sufficient for the OS, Office, a few games, and a couple HD feature-length movie downloads.  I chose to use the SD slot for extra storage just for media, rather than fill up the internal SSD.\n\nSo far, I only have three minor complaints:\n1. While it supports USB On-the-go (you can plug USB devices in through an adapter, so you can connect a full keyboard, mouse, USB flash drive, or any USB device supported by Windows,) that usage shares the port with charger - and unlike some Samsung devices, the Stream 8 doesn't support USB OTG and charging at the same time.  (I have a Samsung adapter that allows both at the same time, the charging function doesn't work when I have a USB device plugged in, too.)\n2. No video out: Micro HDMI would have been nice to add.  Yes, it does support Miracast, but the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter is $60.\n3. You have to remove the back to get to the microSD slot and SIM slot.  While for the SIM that isn't a big deal (although I do swap between two SIMs somewhat often,) it is annoying for the microSD.  It relegates the microSD slot to \"extra storage only\" status, rather than an easy-to-use slot for transferring files."}

This makes the Stream 8 a very decent mobile office when on the road, and incredibly versatile when paired with a cheap bluetooth keyboard.\n\nOnly weak point: the screen resolution is a bit low (although better than tablets this size) and the viewing angles are not stellar.\n\nFor any other thing, though, it is an excellent tablet that is way better than the price may suggest.

First, there is a mura that was in the same spot with two different devices, so there appears to be a design or production defect regarding the screen.  Second, the two different devices have obviously different screens, one being noticeably brighter than the other (the mura being more noticeable on the brighter screen), so it looks like they're sourcing from various display manufacturers, might be a coin toss whether you get a bright or somewhat less bright screen.  Third, hardly a problem, but the rear sticker is slapped on at a slight angle, which makes me wonder how much care and attention was paid to the entire build.  A pretty good tablet for $99, but don't expect perfection or a challenge to more expensive tablets.\n\nPlease note the tablet only supports the 2.4GHz Wifi band, not the 5GHz band.

I already own a Dell Venue 8 which I use on a regular basis for work and really enjoy that tablet. The biggest disappointment for me has been the sheer lack of 4G enabled tablets for Windows 8.1 so when I saw the Stream 8, I grabbed one.\n\nMy initial disappointments have been: HSPA+ only (not LTE), LCD quality, no 64GB storage option and Windows button does not wake the device. That said I am a T-Mobile customer already and was able to get this on my plan for $10 a month for 5GB which is outstanding. Having used this tablet for the last few days I am quite pleased with the purchase, particularly at this low price point. Had the tablet cost more I probably would not have bought it. For having only one gigabyte of RAM, it performs very well although be aware that some programs will not install with less than two gigs. Despite the limit of HSPA+ I have been surprised just how responsive this tablet is on T-Mobile's network. At times it seems just as fast as an LTE connection. The camera(s) are fairly low quality which some will expect at this price but they do get the job done. As for battery life, this is a Windows tablet so the connected standby feature is a mixed bag. I would say that the battery life is decent but plan on charging it at the end of the day. You will get better results by manually switching off and on the radio of choice if you are near WiFi or not. I may be incorrect here but the tablet seems to get better life on WiFi than when using the mobile network.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this tablet for anyone who needs a connected tablet on the go for business or personal use. The device strikes a nice balance of quality and performance for its low price point."}

It's not too big either. I can easily carry it in my backpack. I ordered the official HP case for it http://www.amazon.com/HP-Stream-Tablet-K2N02AA-ABL/dp/B00OJ9BIZO/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1417519984&sr=1-2&keywords=HP+Stream+8+case but as of this review it's still on pre-order here at Amazon. The tablet feels solid on hands. It is plastic but it has a nice heft too it. That being said my biggest concern is that it has NO USB 2.0 or 3.0 port. Only a micro USB. You can purchase a micro USB to USB 2.0 adapter to hook up any accessories. I found this one http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4GGW5Q/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER  A micro HDMI port would have been nice. There is none. Memory is a big concern as well. With less than 32GB of actual usable storage and keeping in mind this is a full Windows device. I managed to install iTunes and the full Office 365 suite. Plus a registry cleaner and Fruit Ninja. I have about 22GB left. I chose this Stream tablet over the 11in laptop because of the 4G. Also I already have an HP with Beats audio and free 4G. I would recommend it if you need something very portable with 4G running full Windows 8.1. To check emails, documents and access websites that otherwise would require a full version of Windows on the go. The screen looks gorgeous. Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and QuickTIme perform flawlessly on Wi-Fi.  I give it four stars. I was already aware of its features and flaws. I would have liked to see a standard USB2.0 port. I've seen it in tablets this size. Or at least a micro HDMI port. Or HP should have included a micro USB to standard USB adaptor. I researched all of the Stream series and for my budget this was the closest fit. Keep in mind HP also has a 14in Stream laptop with 4G for about $299 here on Amazon as well.

It involves getting an install image called Fedlet that already has a 32-bit EFI directory and copying it to an Ubuntu USB and tweaking the grub.cfg file:\n\nDownload the latest Fedlet ISO file from [...] and burn it to a USB drive, (or just extract the EFI directory).\nDownload the Ubuntu ISO file and burn it to a USB drive (I used a 32-bit image but 64-bit images can boot with this method as well although the file layout is slightly different, the 32-bit method is described below):\n\n - Copy the Fedlet EFI directory to the root of the Ubuntu USB drive.\n - Rename the Ubuntu USB /EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg file \"grub.cfg_FEDLET\" (or just delete it).\n - Copy the Ubuntu USB /boot/grub/loopback.cfg file to /EFI/BOOT, and rename it \"grub.cfg\".\n - Edit the new /EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg file like below, changing each \"linux\" and \"initrd\" label to \"linuxefi\" and \"initrdefi\":\n\nChange this:\n\n menuentry \"Try Ubuntu MATE without installing\" {\n  linux /casper/vmlinuz  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu-mate.seed boot=casper iso-scan/filename=${iso_path} quiet splash --\n  initrd /casper/initrd.lz\n\nTo this:\n\n menuentry \"Try Ubuntu MATE without installing\" {\n  linuxefi /casper/vmlinuz  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu-mate.seed boot=casper iso-scan/filename=${iso_path} quiet splash --\n  initrdefi /casper/initrd.lz\n\nThe Ubuntu USB should now boot on the Stream 7.  As you probably know, you can boot the live USB and try it out without installing it. I was able to install Ubuntu to the Stream 7's disk (eMMC drive) with no additional tweaking, it seemed to install both 64-bit and 32-bit EFI's allowing me to toggle the 32-bit EFI to boot successfully.  I wiped the entire disk clean first using Ubuntu's GParted.  I first made recovery media in Windows using the Recovery Manager utility and a 8 GB USB drive in case I want to restore the tablet back to factory configuration. I am also planning a dual boot install with Windows.\n\nYou can also run the Fedlet image, the touchscreen works but it ran slowly and seemed unstable on the Stream 7 so I went with Ubuntu which seems stable, runs as fast as Windows 8.1 and uses less memory.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nUPDATE January 7, 2015:\n\nThe Wifi and touchscreen are working on Ubuntu 14.10 now, here are the command line installation steps I used:\n\nWifi (a working internet connection is required for the first two steps below, I used a USB Wifi Adapter):\n\n  sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-generic git\n  git clone https://github.com/codeTom/rtl8723bs.git\n  cd rtl8723bs\n  make\n  sudo make install\n  sudo depmod -a\n  sudo modprobe r8723bs\n\nTouchscreen:\n\n  sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-generic git (skip this if you have already done it above)\n  git clone https://github.com/hadess/gt9xx.git\n  cd gt9xx\n  make\n  sudo make install\n  sudo depmod -a\n  sudo modprobe goodix_backport\n\nThe touchscreen is currently only working in normal portrait mode, if I rotate the screen 90 degrees right or left in landscape mode, the cursor will not point where my finger is, I will look into a fix for this.\n\nI have Ubuntu installed to the drive along with the Windows 10 Technical Preview as a dual boot. I have instructions for doing that in my review of the Stream 11 laptop which is similar since they both have the same eMMC drive: http://www.amazon.com/review/R28HR668I6LU8Y/ref=cm_cr_pr_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSHLUBU\n\nAfter Ubuntu is installed on the Stream 7, you may need to press F9 during boot up and select Ubuntu from the UEFI menu to get to the Grub Boot Menu.  If the boot hangs, select \"Advanced Options for Ubuntu\" and select recovery mode and it should fix it.\n\nUPDATE January 14, 2015:\n\nMichael (below) found the solution to the touchscreen problem where the touch input does not align with the display after rotating the screen.  Here are the commands to rotate it left:\n\n  xrandr -o left\n  xinput set-prop 'Goodix Capacitive TouchScreen' 'Coordinate Transformation Matrix' 0 -1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1\n\nHere is rotating it right:\n\n  xrandr -o right\n  xinput set-prop 'Goodix Capacitive TouchScreen' 'Coordinate Transformation Matrix' 0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 0 1\n\nMore information is here: http://askubuntu.com/questions/405628/touchscreen-input-doesnt-rotate-lenovo-yoga-13-yoga-2-pro/405643#405643"}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "Sad to now modify from 5 stars to 1 star after only 5 months :-( ! Wanted to get a Windows Tablet for a while, but price point kept me away. So glad a trusted brand like HP is making these available at much more affordable price points now! Problem is that HP is doing a horrible job in quality control on this one :-(!\n\nWas going to buy the 7\" HP tablet for $79, but the much higher camera specs and 200 MB FREE FOR LIFE 4G data sold me on this one! The page has varying specs on camera but on hp site, it confirms there is a 5 Megapixel camera on back and a 2 MP front camera! Can't wait to try it out and also see how well it looks on skype and zoom connections. (Video on skype and zoom continuously cut out. I tried every configuration and fixes that hp support took me through for weeks but in the end, they sent me another tablet cause problem was with the HP tablet. So why shouldn't I be happy? It's not just the loss of many hours but also that once I got the new tablet, HP wanted to charge me to help me move my files to the new one. After wasting hours in research to finally figure out how to move my files, the new HP has battery problems. It sometimes charges and other times does not. Can leave it connected at night with system off or on and assume it's charged by morning, only to find close to zero charge in the morning. Have to waste hours to try to fix it but now the new tablet is also worthless. Why not replace the battery , you might say? HP has ignorantly disallowed battery replacements on this !??? What? Physically the battery is locked up into the system to NOT allow me to fix my tablet without having to go through many more weeks of transfer of files and figuring out how to use my tablet :-( ! Worthless after 3 to 5 months of wasting hours on this. Looking for another tablet, either my trusted Samsungs or might jump into an apple ipad now! Price and trustworthy support and quality control will determine which one I will go into, but NOT buying another HP :-( !\n\nLoved the 200 Megabyte of FREE 4G for Life! Reminds me of the amazon kindle 3g tablet that I bought two of, where I get 3g data for life even 5 years later, but this one is much more user friendly since using the 4G data stream on windows 8 backbone. Comparing that to something I won't buy from carriers , I figured I'm getting about $4000.00 value in this part over 10 years, but even 4 years, that's worth more than $1000-2000 for me. (1 star value since I cannot trust whether HP video, or power is working, but still ok if I can find a power connection somewhere to get 4G to work with my other smart devices.\n\nLove the FULL Windows 8 capabilities with Microsoft Office included! (Well over $69 worth). That's a powerful add-on by Microsoft, but unfortunately HP's quality control problems causing me to try to find a more trusted brand.\n\nquad core processor seems way above most of my current laptops :-)\n\nLACK of HDMI output has been a nightmare. I tried many ways to solve this and get around it. The roku 3 option works best on 4k TV but buggy, since it won't work with video that well.\n\nBattery life - gone with replacement 'new' tablet. Way too much headache to try to transfer files and tmobile 4g and lots of other files and apps, all over again.  HP still missing a simple screen that my cheap samsungs and lgs have where I can tell how much charge there is on my battery when system is off! This is a MAJOR drawback since I cannot know when system is charging or not and how low is the charge before relying on it as I walk out the door. Too late to find out it's not charged when trying to access 4G and it fails to work because of no power. And system won't charge up with my car charger, but my samsung charges without problem.\n\nWireless networking on this is very poor. Drops constantly on both HP stream 8 tablets. HP has not fixed this problem. It's either hardware limitation or driver problems but I can't give HP months of my time to figure out what they should have figured out before releasing this to buyers."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "Quick background on me. I'm an IT Manager and have been using computers since the Commodore 64. I'm familiar and capable around technology. I don't give up easily on tech. I like to have the latest and greatest and try new tech quite often. I'm also a huge fan of HP (it's all I buy at work and at home).\n\nI really wanted to keep this device. However, as a couple of other reviewers have stated, the device works right out of the box but as soon as you apply Windows Updates it stops functioning, mostly due to wireless connection issues. I performed factory resets via the Change PC settings, Update and Recovery, Recovery, Remove everything and reset Windows. I did this three times. Each time the tablet worked OK until I ran Windows updates. It found 38 updates (all Windows 8.1 system updates, no drivers) and once it restarted the device would show it was connected to the wireless network but it couldn't communicate. I couldn't ping the router nor the router ping the device. HP's website does not have any updated drivers for these units yet. Windows Update did not find any updated drivers for the unit either. I checked RealTek for updated versions of the wireless driver but their site didn't have anything either. Other troubleshooting steps that I took: disabling IPv6, setting my router to only 2.4Ghz mode (unit does not support 5Ghz), using static IP settings and unfortunately the same results each time. From the many positive reviews I can only surmise that there is a small portion of these units that are affected by this.\n\nWhile the device worked it was a good device. I was surprised by the performance of the quad-core Atom processor and only 1 gb of RAM. It ran quite well. It is only 32 bit so be aware of that. It is Windows 8.1 (not RT).\n\nThe unit comes with Office 365 Personal for a year which is a nice feature and almost worth the price of admission alone. The screen clarity was very good although the touch responsiveness was a little sluggish. There is no GPS and a single micro-USB port. The device does have a MicroSD slot that will support a 32Gb card (you have to remove the back cover to install it). Battery life seemed mediocre. When I was installing updates, resetting the device and reinstalling the updates and resetting again, it ran for about 2 hours and used about 60% of the charge. Keep in mind that to perform the system reset you have to have the device plugged in so it was getting charged at that time as well.\n\nAll in all, this would be a great device, especially for the $99 price! Unfortunately, there appears to be a problem with the units that coming from Amazon. HP doesn't post reviews for this unit so I couldn't check there for similar problems. The Microsoft Store site did not list any issues like this.\n\nAll in all, if you can get a good one you will probably like and want to keep it. I know I would have kept mine!\n\nThanks for reading."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "Like another reviewer pointed out, this tablet did not include any paperwork about your free 1-year Office 365 subscription with order of this product. However, I stumbled upon how to sign up by accident flipping through the tile screens. I think if you search for \"Office 365\" the tile will pop up and once you launch it, it will ask you to sign up for your free subscription. Once you sign up, you will get a message to include a PC with your subscription as well.\n\nKinda lame of HP not to include any material in the box on this important incentive. That is why I give it 4 stars."}

I also tried watching Netflix and it was a very decent quality (both audio and video).\n\nOne thing to note, which is not obvious from the product description, is that you need to open up the back cover to install micro SD card.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I took the tablet from a store to buy me a \"business trip present\" - I am not really needing it but I was curious to learn how Win 8.1\nperforms on such  a small machine. Here in Germany the tablet are not yet available ;-) . The competition are a Nexus 7, diverse Apple Ipads as well as a Lenovo A1 - Android single core tablet.\n\nFirst of all my overall value for price impression. On the first glance 99 US appear cheap.\n\nOn the positive side, the well resolved, bright screen with no problems with it's viewing angle. However the light sources (LEDs?) at the bottom of the tablet appear marginal uneaven, perhaps due to slight pressure in the screen housing - visible with a black display only.\n\nThe sound system plays reasonable well, however the internal speakers are bad compared to all of the tablets above. Using headphones, the sound appears slightly compromised with accompanying hissing noises from the CPU/electronics, depending on the computational load. But hearing louder music it does not bother me, only in more silent passages.\n\nThe battery consumption appears to be quite high during the operation.  I always feel that I would like to recharge as soon as possible. I never feel that way with my Nexus or Ipads. Positive is that the back cover can be removed and the battery gets visible. Although a label says it cannot be removed, I doubt this is not possible at all.\n\nComputational speed is very ok! Even an XBOX racing game and many other games i tried out were just fine. ( I guess one of the  tablet's cool niche will be playing ?).\n\nGPS ? I don't think it has one -  minus because I like tablets as off line mapping utilities\n\nCamera - bad !! front and back - color tint, not very sensitive at all. Unusable to my taste.\n\nWindows: Not really usable without keyboard when switching to ordinary GUI elements. Screen is too tiny and setting it to higher\nresolutions does not really work without misplacement of GUI elements. However with a Bluetooth keyboard, mouspad (Firstcom)\nthe tablet gets a \"real Laptop feeling\" - that is really nice and works out very well using Office applications !\n\nStorage space:32 Gb internal is chewed away by the operating system. But you will have 12-15 GBytes for you. Mini SD card can be added up to 32 GByte. I tried out a 64 GB SDXC Scandisk Card level 10, which apparently works!!! I moved files from internal to SD at 8 MBytes/sec. that's very nice !!\n\nSo finally - I like this machine, despite its shortcomings. I t is a real PC!, a tiny one. Does it compete ? To my other tablets ?\nNot really ! but I like setting up Itunes, Office, and other applications I only use on my PC to have that in my pocket. It is fine to try out some things, while under way .\n\nHave I said - I like it ?\n\nPS - sorry for misspellings, i am not a native speaker :-)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I'm an avowed Mac fan, but I needed to run a few windows programs and was enticed by this tablet.  I was very surprised to find it become my go-to device.\n\nFirst, it does something that no Apple or Android tablet can do - it runs the full version of iTunes.  The Kindle app is great.  You can install the free version of Spotify and play music on demand (without paying).  Same thing with Hulu.com.  Similar to Spotify, you can play anything on the Hulu site in explorer without paying.  It also includes a year of onedrive and Office 365.\n\nThe internal cameras are nothing to write home about, but they work well enough for Skype and video chat.\n\nAs for the size, it's a little bit shorter and a few mm thicker than a Nexus 7.  It reminds me of the first Kindle Fire in that it's not the thinnest tablet around.\n\nBut the biggest surprise is that the HP Stream had me rethink my planned iPad Air 2 purchase.  It won't replace it, but I now intend to buy a Surface Pro 3.  My iPad 3 still runs fine, but I feel that browsing and working is much more intuitive on a desktop OS.  (That said, it really makes the use case for a future iPad Air/Macbook Air hybrid.  I didn't think it would work but, in that case, props go to Microsoft.  And this is coming from somebody who has been all Mac for at least 6 years.\n\nOne note.  When I received my unit, it didn't recognise the existence of any internal wireless devices.  I nearly returned it, but read online that I should do a refresh of the OS - basically a reinstall.  It solved the problem.  (I'm not 100% convinced my unit was brand new, even though it was sold by Amazon and listed as such)."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I was really looking forward to trying this tablet out. To date I'd had no exposure to Windows 8.1 or a dedicated Windows tablet. I have had a decent 10.1 inch Android tablet.\n\nFirst are foremost, the elephant in the room... or rather, the mouse. This is a seven inch wide screen tablet. I have friends whose who online lives are conducted via five inch cell phone screens and they're happy with it. The screen on this tablet is nice. Don't get me wrong. I was able to stream from Amazon video in HD (720) and the video was crisp and clean. Images display well but, again, the screen is just seven inches. I can't imagine trying to be productive with something so small.\n\nFor a device with only one gig of RAM this runs Windows fairly well. I wws able to load several Windows programs including the Calibr eBook manager which took a little longer to convert eBooks between formats but did the job. I also loaded a legacy email and Usenet program that I've been using for a decade or longer. Along with directly installed programs I also downloaded a handful of apps from the very buggy Microsoft app store. The store worked less than 50% of the time while I was trying this tablet out. I at one point had to resort to switching to a local login account and then back to my Hotmail logi. It only took about an hour of reading web forums to find that solution to the Windows app store refusing to work.\n\nTwo problems I ran into were the sound which is from a single speaker hidden in a slot on one of the short sides of the tablet. If you want to listen to anything other than the default Window's beeps and tones you'll want to pair this with a blue tooth speaker or headphones. The speaker in this tablet is deplorable. The next problem I had was the tablet runs HOT. I was running a program designed for Windows 98, downloading and reading posts un Usenet and viewing a few posted vacation and astronomy images and I had to stop. The tablet was so hot it was uncomfortable to hold and I worried it might overheat and become damaged.\n\nWhile I was impressed to see Windows running on a small tablet I was thoroughly unimpressed with Windows 8.1 the tile system is just terrible.\n\nSo, it has good video quality on a too small screen with horrible sound and a flaky app store to rely upon, though you can download and install normal Windows programs. I just wasn't that crazy about this tablet. And will definitely be sticking with Android and a much larger screen."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "I purchased this for my wife as a tablet.  This is important.  She needed a tablet and not a PC.  She needed a tablet and not a laptop.  Although the HP Stream 7 runs the full version of Windows, it's running on tablet hardware.  Intel has finally started building x86 processors that have the battery life to compete with ARM-based tablets.  If this was available two years ago, we would never have seen Windows RT which was a stop-gap measure by Microsoft so that Windows would run on hardware with better than 3-4 hour battery life.  But I digress.  My point is that even though the Stream 7 is running a full version of Windows, IT'S STILL A TABLET and thus it should be judged as such and my review will reflect that.  So if you're a cheapo and need a full computer but are too cheap and think that this will be a viable replacement, it's not.  If you were thinking about getting a laptop and think this is a viable replacement, it's not.\n\nI was originally looking at the 7 inch Galaxy Tab 4 for my wife.  We're not invested in the Apple ecosystem so overpriced i stuff was out of the picture.  But both of us share a Windows desktop and have Windows Phones so when I saw this sexy looking tablet for $99, I ran it by her and she said okay.  The main purpose of this device, like most tablets, is consumption.  Reading, watching, listening, browsing, and playing.  Minimal productive work can be done on this, or any other tablet.  So when I see people complaining about how small the text is, I have to shake my head.  If you need to be on the Windows desktop more than 30% of the time, buy a PC or a laptop.  As a tablet, you should be using this in the Modern UI (formerly called \"Metro\") most of the time.  The only reason I had to go to the desktop was to install various coupon printers for my wife. As a tablet, this is awesome.  Sure Windows 8.1 doesn't have billions of apps, but that's a temporary problem.  Once Windows 10 hits and everyone starts writing universal apps, the floodgates will open.\n\nMy only real knocks on the thing is it feels heavy in one hand, the battery life is kind of sorry and 1 GB of memory is meh.  I haven't run into any memory-related performance issues, but I would have liked to have 2 GB of memory.  But hey, it's a $99 tablet.  So other than those things, the HP Stream 7 is a solid tablet that stands toe-to-toe with the iPad and Galaxy Tab, but if you're in a pinch and need to do minor productive work on this, that's where it blows the traditional tablets out of the water."}

While it's not a perfect device, I can't help but love it due to its high bang for the buck ratio.\n\nDisadvantages: No LED to indicate its charging when plugged in. No externally available micro-SD card slot, you have to power it down and open the back cover to access the micro-SD slot. The speaker is located where I tend to hold this type of device. It's a bit heavy and thick. I couldn't get iTunes 12 to recognize my iTunes music that I copied to a micro-SD card. Only has 1GB of RAM. However let's take into account that this device only costs $99.\n\nAdvantages: It has a 32GB SSD and storage can be expanded via a micro-SD card. It has a 64-bit quad-core Intel Atom CPU, (however it's running a 32-bit version of Windows 8.1), so it performs in a surprisingly snappy manner. It has a bright and fairly sharp screen. The plastic casing has a decent tactile feel to it and has a slight bevel around the edge, making it easier to hold. There's a Windows soft key on the right side to bring up the Windows 8 Start menu. There is no crapware installed on this device, shocking based on previous experience with HP products. The width of this device is perfect for me in terms of using the onscreen keyboard while in landscape mode. Streaming music and videos run without skipping a beat.\n\nAfter installing all my apps it still has 15GB of free space. Given the variety of available free cloud services, there's really no good reason to store much data on a device of this class. Having said that  I installed a 32GB micro-SD card to store a sub-set of my MP3 collection and some movies. The Windows 8 Metro Music and Movies apps work surprisingly well and can playback media from my micro-SD card, so I ended up removing the iTunes software I installed. I was a bit skeptical of the Windows 8.1 GUI but after giving it a chance, I actually get it now and have gotten to like it. I'm a Windows and Linux system administrator, so I installed a SSH terminal, a RDP client, a VMware vSphere and a VPN client. I can actually use this tablet to manage my servers at work from anywhere I have wifi. Consider installing Google Chrome and enable the Windows 8 mode, MSIE 11 in the Metro mode is rather goofy in terms of usability. After setting up this device, I simply could not put it down. My work laptop has stayed in my laptop bag since I bought my HP Stream 7. Well done HP!"}

No additional slots or ports besides mentioned, there are work arounds, but that will cost money and storage space.\n\nOverall:\nIt is OK for the cost. I am somewhat disappointed as I am used to higher end phones, laptops, desktops, and not much with tablets. If I were in the market to upgrading a Windows 7 or needed Office 365, this would have been a great buy as the tablet would have been free (actually, you would save money by buying this and using the software codes instead). Unfortunately I needed neither. This is what it is, a $99 tablet running windows. Great as an ebook reader. Great if you don't have much experience with higher tech gadgets. And as some IT professionals have stated, great to do server things with, but I am in the middle between these.\n\nMy plan for this is to get a 64gb micro SD (even though the specs say up to 32) and hope it will work, if not, replace my phones micro with the 64 and put the 32 in this tablet. I plan to get the office 365 and run it on my laptop, then delete it off of the tablet and just run an older office on it. I have a case with BT keyboard on the way that I bought for $28 and it has an OTG adapter coming with it free. I also plan to get a cheap BT mouse for it so that I can hopefully use the actual desktop. I plan to use it as a media station for books and movies, and possibly an app here and there. I give it 3 stars, it isn't horrible, but I guess I wanted a little more. Next time I would spend an extra $100 to get something with more ram, a 8-10\" display, and more functionality.\n\nI hope my review helps othere that are looking at this tablet."}

I've never gotten such capability and quality in such a small, inexpensive, neat package.  So far, it does everything I do with a laptop or desktop:  fast web browsing, convenient email, uploading and running standard windows programs, and transfering files, music, video, pictures, and geocaches with a simple on-the-go (OTG) cable or through the cloud.  The only limitations on performance will be RAM and storage capacity.  I'm not an avid gamer, and I don't use Office 365, so no problem for me.  If you are looking for a simple Windows alternative to Android and Apple tablets, this one just might be good enough for you.  I bought it for travel, to replace a much heavier, bulky laptop.  By the way, I almost NEVER write feedback comments, but I'm so happy with this little tablet, I just wanted to share!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "Very slow and bordering on unuseable with newest version of Windows even with little to nothing additional stored in the memory.  Android tablets for the same money are faster and more useable, I should know as I replaced this with an Android tablet for the same price.  Suitable for only 1 task at a time."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUFQ", "review": "There was a constant background noise that got louder when I touched the screen (It wasn't the headphones, I checked). When I got the tablet, it said it only had 20 usable GB for storage. When I added all the storage I was using plus the free space I had, it added up to 10 GB. Neither of those numbers are 32 GB as listed. After a couple months, the background in the start menu would randomly change on it's own. A few months later, the screen started glitching out - would flash on and off, the whole screen would be moved down (while the controls stay still), and other times the screen resolution would randomly change."}
