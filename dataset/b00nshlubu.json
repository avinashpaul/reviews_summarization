{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "Recently bought this (the HP Stream 11) from the Microsoft Store (for $170 - with 10% student discount and 5% off coupon). I like it so far.\n\nLike:\nThis is compact, feels solidly built and I really love the color and texture (doesn't catch fingerprints)\nKeyboard is good (97% size of a normal full size keyboard; up and down arrows are a lot smaller though)\nReasonably fast so far - turns on as soon as you open the clamshell\n\nNeutral:\nScreen isn't great, it is kinda grainy due to the matte finish; viewer angles are very limited - ok if one person is looking straight into the screen, not OK if 2 people are watching Netflix\nAudio is just average - gets the job done\nTrackpad is finicky - disable side swipes (easy to do)\n\nDislike:\nStorage - 32 GB eMMC that allows the laptop to be compact also greatly restricts the usabiity. Just 1 week into using it, it has just 2 GB free. This is after I installed ms office pro 2013 and a vmware software (just these 2 programs!). I have an SD card but you cant install and run programs on it as far as i know... the storage is becoming a major concern and i am highly inclined to return it to MSFT store because of this. I so wish this came with 64GB SSD. I would have been happy to pay upto $50 more for it.\n\nTips: Backup onedrive on SD card, change default download location to SD card, get windows backup on USB drive and remove partition. You might be able to survive the 32 gb data that way.\n\nVerdict: I really like this little machine - the form factor is awesome. So I am trying to manage with the little storage. Not sure if I can make it work with this little storage though. SD card and cloud can only help you to an extent - you need harddrive space to run programs!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "Just over a year ago, I got my first Chromebook, the Acer C720. Since that time, except for gaming, it has been my most used computer for everyday web consumption: Ebay, Amazon, Facebook, Google+, Wordpress, Netflix, Youtube, etc.  I even figured out how to use Crouton to install Linux (Ubuntu) on it, so that I could install Steam for local gaming and Steam Streaming.  While the Acer doesn't have a great screen, or even a good screen, and it feels kind of, well, cheap overall, for the price it was a fantastic value.\n\nWith the release of the HP Stream 11, I think Windows has a device that hits a similar value/performance intersection. I've only owned it one day but based on initial impressions, this is a fantastic value and an easy recommendation for a LOT of use cases.\n\nSPECS\n\nThe HP Stream 11 is an 11.6\" Windows 8.1 Laptop, powered by an Intel Celeron N2840 processor at 2.16 GHz. It has 2 GB of RAM and a 32 GB SSD, neither of which can be upgraded. It is rated for 8.5 hours of battery life, depending on performance and brightness settings of course.\n\nThe screen is a 1366x768 high definition LCD screen, which has a matte coating for anti-glare. This is basically the same screen as the Acer C720. Which is to say, the screen is pretty bad. The matte coating takes a relatively low-resolution affair and makes it that much more dull and muted. That said, it is serviceable enough and has decent brightness considering the price point. Just know going in that your tradeoff for choosing this over a similarly priced $200 Windows Tablet is that the screen on a tablet will likely be IPS and significantly better in terms of clarity and viewing angles. However, this matte coating does help very much with glare in overhead and outdoor lighting situations.\n\nAs far as ports, the Stream 11 has 2 USB ports (one 3.0 and one 2.0), a full-size SD slot, and HDMI. It has a single combo headphone/mic port.\n\nIt also has two down-firing speakers that put out decent sound for the price point.\n\nSETUP\n\nSetting up this device wasn't too bad. Windows 8 has come a long way over the past 12 months. In December 2013 my wife's HP required several hours of updates, and updating my Surface Pro (1st Gen) from Windows 8.0 to 8.1 was very difficult; there was a point where the update hung, and I had to do quite a bit of research to get past it.\n\nContrast this to the HP Stream 11:  It took 10 minutes to get from unboxing to a functional Windows desktop.  Once there I removed Norton, installed Avast, installed Chrome, and installed Steam, and then installed 35 Windows updates (33 required and 2 optional). This took 22 minutes, plus another 12 minutes of processing after I rebooted, for a total time of 34 minutes. The system handled them all with no crashes, hangs, or issues.\n\nDrivers for accessories like my USB Logitech Mouse and Dell Printer were plug and play with no issues.\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThis processor/RAM setup powers a lot of 2014's Chromebooks, and thus it has Octane benchmarks similar to devices like the Asus C200 Chromebook and Toshiba Chromebook 2.  My personal Octane scores were in the 7,500-8,000 range. As a point of comparison, the Acer C720 and HP Chromebook 11, with 2 GB of RAM and an Intel Celeron 2955 processor with Haswell architecture have benchmarks in Octane of around 11,000.  You're looking at about 20% decrease in performance.\n\nIn general, most websites load quickly, but more intensive sites like The Verge hang a bit while various images and videos load. Once pages are loaded, everything scrolls smoothly. I read some people complaining about Chrome being an issue on this device but it ran fine for me. I had IE with one tab, Chrome with three tabs, and Steam open and the web pages were running fine. I also tested Google Docs and that ran smoothly.\n\nBoot time to the log-in screen is about 10 seconds, plus another 5-7 seconds of loading after you enter your log-in credentials.  Unlike Chrome OS, when you hit the desktop a Windows device is still processing and loading in the background, so the full boot takes a bit longer - but I'd still say the whole process is under 30 seconds and to hit the log-in in 10 seconds is impressive.\n\nI had no problems installing Avast, Chrome, and Steam on the device. I tested Steam Streaming on my local network from my desktop computer and was able to play Wolfenstein: The New Order at an excellent FPS. I also tried a few games running locally including Pacman DX, Luftrausers, and Towerfall Ascension. These ran without issue. I would think that many indie games should run on this, especially those of the 2D variety, but 3D gaming performance will probably be terrible. You don't have much space to store modern games, anyway.  As a Steam Streaming device though, it works fine. And, it should be able to handle most emulation of systems up through the PS1 / Sega Saturn / N64 generation as well as a lot of good retro games on GOG.\n\nOddly enough, the wireless speed I got using tests on this device were about 10-15% slower than the same tests on my Moto X or Acer C720 connected to the same network, from the same location. That said, the connection didn't drop at all for the four hours I had the computer running.  (If interested:  I have 50 Mb down and up via FiOS. My first speed test showed this was only getting 28 up and 25 down, but a re-test after rebooting later showed 37 up and 36 down)\n\nI haven't had the device long enough to test the battery but I would expect 8 hours is pretty reasonable, keeping in mind that brightness and what you're doing for that time play a major role.\n\nBUILD QUALITY\n\nThis is a mixed bag. As noted the screen is the low point of the device. It isn't so terrible that the device isn't usable, but it is pretty bad. If you can live with the C720, you can live with this, but you won't like it.\n\nThe Stream 11 comes in at under 3 lbs of weight (2.8 lbs), feeling just a bit heavier than my C720. Heavy compared to modern 10\" tablets, but still relatively light.\n\nOne complaint I have is that this device only comes in two color options, Blue or Magenta. While I like the blue - it looks better in person than it does in pictures - the absence of a neutral color like white, black, or grey is strange. The diminutive size and blue color does make this look more like a young adult toy than a full-fledged Windows 8.1 device.  That said, it is reasonably sturdy in the hand, feeling and looking mostly like a shrunken version of the HP14 Chromebook.\n\nUnfortunately, the trackpad on the HP Stream 11 is NOT on par with the HP14 Chromebook. While the HP14 is a $300-$380 device (depending on specs), I don't think it is unreasonable to expect the touchpad to be on the same level of quality as the HP14 or C720. It isn't. I've used worse, but I definitely will prefer a mouse with this, whereas on my Chromebooks I think of a mouse as totally optional.  Through use, I've gotten better with it, but at first I was having a very hard time just dragging and dropping files into folders, for instance.\n\nThe keyboard pretty much feels like a shrunken HP14 Chromebook keyboard. Keys are a bit squishy and don't have a ton of travel, but it is stated as 97% full sizes and my WPM was about the same as usual.\n\nEXTRAS\n\nOn its own, this is a pretty compelling device for $200, but HP throws in some goodies.\n\nYou get a one-year subscription to Office 365 Personal (one computer + one tablet). This does not come installed on the device; you get a redemption key that must be used by the end of 2016. I actually love this, as you can redeem the subscription on another device if you choose to do so. This is a $70 value. I'm still debating whether to redeem this key for my Stream 11, so I did not test MS Office, but based on how it runs Google Docs and Sheets, I would expect they'll run just fine provided you don't have a ton of other applications going at the same time.\n\nYou also get a $25 Windows App Store gift-card.\n\nFinally, you supposedly get 1 TB of MS Cloud storage for a year, which is pretty crazy if accurate. As I have no need for that yet - I have 150 GB of Drive storage from my Moto X and Chromebooks - I haven't tested it, but it is a very nice add-on.\n\nThese offers compare pretty well to those Google gives you with Chromebooks (12 GoGo In-flight passes, 60 days Google All Access Music passes, and 100 GB Cloud Storage for two years).\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nI'll need to spend some more time with this device before I know for sure how I feel about it, but first impressions have been pretty favorable. I didn't expect it to run Windows 8 so well, or have such a short boot time. The Chrome performance was much better than I'd expected based on what I read elsewhere, and Steam Streaming worked perfectly.\n\nWhile I still wish there was a neutral color option like Black or Grey on the market, which would make me feel much better about suggesting to grown adults that this is a serious computing device, this is a decent-looking device with build quality and Windows 8 performance above expectations for this price point. For students or those seeking an ultraportable back-up computer, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with this computer.\n\nIf you're thinking about getting an Office 365 Personal subscription anyway, this computer is basically $130, which is an absurd value."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "The HP Stream 11 reminds is me a lot of my old HP netbook. My favorite things about this computer is that it's light enough to carry around without the bulk. The machine feels as if it weighs two pounds total. It's about the size of an Amazon Kindle, and easy to slip into a medium sized purse or computer sack with no problem.\n\nOne surprise that I had: the laptop is much prettier than its picture on Amazon.com. It's a matted blue with a silver HP logo. The keyboard itself is a bit of a standout. When you open the keyboard, it is almost a sunset-gradient color (with a polka dot tech pattern).  Design is something that matters to me when purchasing a computer, and this one looks much better, and much more elegant that its picture would suggest.\n\nSince this is a low-price machine, some of the high-end features are missing. There is no CD ROM/DVD player. The screen isn't a touch screen, and the mouse is not as sensitive as some high-end machines. The quick access buttons are also under the function keys too. Additionally, there isn't a keypad on the machine. It does have SD-ROM card slots, and USB ports, to use with your machine, as well as a headphones port.\n\nMy ultimate disappointment with the HP Stream 11 is not it's design or features; which I was satisfied with. My main problem is with the operating system that it uses. Although I like the design of this laptop, I don't like the Windows 8.1 operating system which is the antithesis of intuitive. Windows 8.1. was one of the reasons my new Dell laptop became a pretty paper weight, rather than being used daily.\n\nAlthough you can access some operating system functions through going through the control panel, there are other functions that you cannot uninstall from your desktop (some of the bloat ware). Additionally, it basically forces you to get a Microsoft Account before setting up your desktop, and if you do not uninstall some anti-privacy features, advertisers and other third-party individuals will have access to your desktop. Savvy users should go through the custom install and ensure that these third-party groups do not have access to your computer. Another draw back for this machine is that it has a subscription to Office (for a year) rather than the ability to own the software outright.\n\nI plan on installing Windows 7 (and when all the kinks are worked out) Linux Mint onto my new HP computer. I am going to use this primarily as a machine that I take to work, to write my articles on when I'm at work.  I'm really happy with the HP Stream, overall, but I plan to use a different operating system with it in the end. Three and a half stars."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "Hi everyone, I received the blue Steam 11 directly from HP today. I have only spent a few hours with it but I thought I would post a quick review.  It seems like a lot of computer for the money, it has a very solid feel. The only complaint I have is my touchpad has a slight rattle, when you tap it lightly you can hear and feel a rattle.  It is hard to explain but it does not have the same tight, spring-loaded feel of other laptop touchpads I have used. I usually use an external mouse so it should not be an issue.\n\nI did not test performance other than playing some YouTube videos at 720p and the performance seemed good. I plugged in a 23 inch LCD TV to the HDMI port and that looked very good and the audio played through the TV speakers automatically and sounded good. I checked the disk with the Windows Disk Management Utility and it shows it has a 29 GB Hynix HBG4e with a 260 MB EFI partition, 21.54 GB NTFS C: drive (4.3 GB used, 17.2 GB free) and a 7.20 GB Recovery partition.\n\nChanging the BIOS to legacy boot mode, I attempted to boot Mint Linux 17 from a USB stick (and also an external DVD drive) and it booted very slowly, I never got it fully booted.  It kept displaying \"Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk0rpmb\" errors which I googled and found is a known issue with the latter Linux kernels and newer eMMC flash devices.  There is apparently a kernel patch for it. I also got these same errors attempting Mint 16 but when I dropped back to Mint 15 with the 3.8.0-19-generic kernel, it booted fine.  Unfortunately the Realtek RTL8723BE Wifi card was not recognized and the touchpad did not work.  I will continue to work on these issues and report back my progress.\n\nUPDATE 11/2/14:\n\nAfter some experimentation, the best Linux distro I have found so far for the Stream 11 seems to be the newly released Ubuntu 14.10 with its 3.16 kernel which recognizes the Stream's Wifi and touchpad.  It does still have the problem with the slow boot up (about 8 minutes compared to over 2 hours for Mint 17) where it displays \"Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk0rpmb\" and \"stdin: I/O error\" errors.  After boot up, other operations trying to read the disk are also slow.\n\nThe problem appears to be the Hynix HBG4e drive's 4 MB Replay Protected Memory Block (RPMB) partition which mounts as /dev/mmcblk0rpmb. It uses different commands and the Linux kernel is unable to access it. There are some kernel patches available that prevent the kernel from attempting access but I have not tried that yet. The partition is apparently used to store DRM and/or OEM licensing keys.\n\nUPDATE 11/5/14:\n\nI installed Ubuntu Mate 14.10 64-bit to the hard drive as a dual boot with Windows 8.1 and it seems to be working well. It has solved (or at least greatly reduced) the problem with the RPMB partition delaying booting and disk operations.  I wrote up the procedure I used:\n\n Dual Boot Ubuntu 14.10/Windows 8.1 Install Procedure for the HP Stream 11 laptop:\n\n - Download the Ubuntu 14.10 64-bit ISO image and burn it to a USB drive, (the 32-bit images cause issues with UEFI and the grub boot loader). I used Ubuntu Mate but other flavors such as Kubuntu and Xubuntu should work fine also.\n\n - In Windows, use the Disk Management utility to shrink the C: drive to make room for Ubuntu, I shrank mine by 10 GB.\n\n - In the BIOS, leave the legacy support boot option set to the default \"Disabled\".\n\n - Turn the computer on and when you see the backlight, press the F9 key to display boot options and select the USB drive. Select \"Install Ubuntu\", there is a 2-3 minute delay due to the RPMB partition issue, (press ESC if you want to see the errors).\n\n - When the Install screen appears, select language and add a Wifi connection if you have it. I selected both options presented here: \"Download Updates while Installing\" and \"Install this third-party software\".\n\n - There was a 8 minute delay here while it read the disk configuration due to the RPMB partition issue.\n\n - For Installation Type, pick \"Something else\".  It should now show the free disk space you created in Windows, I created a 8 GB ext4 partition mounted on root \"/\" and a 2 GB swap area partition.\n\n - Highlight the ext4 partition and click \"Install Now\", it will confirm that it will write changes to the disk configuration.\n\n - If you want to only run Ubuntu and not Windows, you can wipe the entire eMMC drive clean (including the 7 GB recovery partition) by selecting the default \"Erase Disk and Install Ubuntu\" option. It will do the partitioning for you if you want by creating a 512 MB EFIboot, 26.73 GB ext4, and a 1.89 GB swap partition.  (You might want to first create recovery media in Windows using the Recovery Manager utility and a 8 GB USB drive so you can restore back to the factory configuration if needed.)\n\n - While the installation runs, it will prompt for time zone, keyboard, user credentials and computer name.\n\n - When it finishes, reboot and you should see the GRUB Boot Menu allowing you to boot into either Ubuntu or Windows (if you left Windows in place on the drive).\n\nWhen Ubuntu runs for the first time, the touchpad clicks may be disabled depending on the Ubuntu flavor installed so you need an external mouse to navigate to System => Control Center => Mouse and select \"Enable Mouse Clicks With Touchpad\". There may be a way to do this from the keyboard also.\n\nThere may also be an issue with the touchpad and mouse freezing so you need to run the Software Updater to get the latest updates and then reboot and it should hopefully fix this.  (It was fixed on Ubunbu Mate but not on Ubuntu Gnome when I tried it.)  The RPMB partition issue also seems fixed at this point, I installed GParted and it came up quickly without any delay.\n\nHope this helps."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "Speed\n\nThis is a Celeron processor, but running on flash/ssd hardware makes it pretty zipping. It's definitely not a workhorse but if you just need a kick-around laptop to bring with you to work/starbucks/wherever else, it can do the basics and then some. Wireless AGN speeds can handle just about as much as you can throw at it.\n\nDisplay\n\nYou get a pretty decent and vibrant 1366x768, which can play 720p content easily (720p is 1280x720). On this small a screen and the distance you'll likely be sitting from it, it would be extremely unlikely you could noticed the difference from 1080p. Viewing angles are pretty decent vs similar sized laptops I've seen. If you'd complaing about not having 1080p or 4k, why are you looking at this laptop?\n\nQuality / Price\n\nQuality is pretty decent for a tiny $200 laptop - probably more than I would have expected. I'm disappointed that the touchpad can only be button-pressed in the bottom half (rather than anywhere on the touchpad).  Still better than the old-fashioned 2 separate buttons that plague most Windows machines, but definitely not as good as the apple-esque full touchpad. But a reasonable trade-off for a $200 laptop. Battery life is fantastic.\n\nSoftware\n\nIt comes with Windows 8.1 (non-RT), which is great. The flash-based storage lends to a pretty slick interface. Unfortunately it's also plagued by a ton of included bloatware, such as:\nVarious HP junkware\nApple Bonjour (spyware in my opinion)\nDropbox\nTripAdvisor\nAmazon\nMcAfee LiveSafe\nWeather Channel\n\"Snapfish\"\n\"MySMS\"\n\nPrivacy\n\nIf you read the HP Terms-of-Service (which you wouldn't get if you bought an Apple or direct-from-Microsoft product), it collects \"anonymous technical information related to HP Software and your HP Product\". HP and included third-party software will also collect personal information including your IP address and anything you include in the registration. You can't opt-out of it, so this is a nice middle-finger to the buyer. You can't re-install the OS thinking you'll get a clean slate; you just get a refresh of Win8.1 with all the bloatware back. So you can either uninstall the junk, app by app, or try to extract the serial number and re-install from a fresh 8.1 key. It's not listed on any product information or a sticker on the back, so it's a hassle.\n\nOverall a decent product, decent battery life, with some significant trade-offs."}

The 11 also has a better performing Intel processor, an N2840 Celeron, that does better with core browsing and computing tasks. And if that's not enough, the 11 comes with a one year subscription to Office 365 so that a full version of Office can be installed on the 11. The 14 does not come with the Office subscription.\n\nLike the 14 there are some limitations.  The device is limited to 2 gigs of non-expandable RAM and has a very small 32 gig solid state disk that's also not accessible. Although 32 gigabytes is double the storage available on most Chromebooks, Windows and its applications require much more disk space to operate.\n\nDespite its limitations this is a very capable and VERY affordable Windows PC that is designed to go head-to-head with Chromebooks. In fact it has most of the same guts as a Chromebook but runs Windows 8.1 instead.\n\nI am excited about the current state of the low-end market. We are getting great capable PCs at very low prices.

She loved the portability but soon found the Stream to be lacking in many ways. The final straw was not having enough hard drive space to update Windows 10. Her HP Stream reminds us daily that our current version of Windows is no longer supported and isn't receiving security updates. However, nothing can be done about this because we don't have enough space to update Windows... ridiculous.\n\nI would gladly work with HP to resolve this problem but it doesn't seem likely.  According to other reviews HP is aware of the Stream's problems yet is unable or unwilling to correct them."}

Connects easily to wifi (even dodgy sources), works well with large files and programmes, and is everything I've needed - with the essential addition of a micro-SD card, where I store all of my docs, music, etc. I followed previous reviews' advice and got a wireless mouse to use, which I prefer to the occasionally less-than-accurate track pad.

It's lightweight, the speed is also nice, and it comes with a free $25 Microsoft gift card as well as a 1 year subscription. I was able to get the cobalt blue color and it looks very nice! Now is it a good laptop for college students, I don't know if I would say that. Yes, it is easy to bring to class because my backpack is small as well and you have the available Microsoft Office 2016, but when I got my laptop there was only 1GB of space available out of 28GB. I tried to see if there were maybe some documents or unnecessary things that they had put on here before giving it to me, but I could not find anything on there that was over 1MB. So I'm not sure how much computer space most students would need, but this is definitely not enough. Also they deceive you. Lol. It's actually not touchscreen but the resolution and quality is very nice. It also includes a webcam! Yet some other things that I have noticed is the sound. The sound is very nice don't get me wrong, but sometimes when I put my headphones in it sounds muffled or static, but that could be my headphones; however, I never have this problem when plugging my headphones into my phone or tablet. Overall, I would say that this laptop is good while it lasts."}

The computer is not touchscreen compatible even though it says that it is. I even called the amazon customer support and was told by a lady that it was when in fact it isn't, the only touchscreen thing about it is a keyboard that pops up on the screen that you cant even use due to no touchscreen compatibility. 2. the laptop does get hot but really hot when charging. 3. it does not take a normal SD card as it takes an Micro SD card. Does have wifi setup, Bluetooth, HDMI port, 2 Usb ports, a SS port, Headphone jack, webcam. I rate it a two due to those cons but if you deal with them then its pretty decent but for me personally I might return this product. hopefully this was helpful."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "Pros: Beautiful color, nice design, keyboard feel very nice and types super smoothly, the screen resolution is superb for the price, very nice and lightweight, feels like a super expensive computer but it isn't!\nCons: not much space, but that is easily fixed by connecting an external hard drive. On Amazon they run from 20 to $60 depending on how much storage you want. Also id you just use for surfing the web, social media, checking email and some light gaming, you should be totally fine.\nOverall, I love this computer and am super pleased with it I can't wait to continue using it. Also my sister wants one now too in purple."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "Perfect little computer for someone looking for a computer that can do all the basics, and save some money. I was looking for a small and light weight computer to take on my trip to europe, and this is the perfect computer! It seems durable, and feels like it is high quality. I also love the vibrant purple color! My only complaint is that it is a little slow, but this could be because it is it still updating and has some of the features that new computers have that slow it down. However, if you are just looking for something to type papers with and surf the web, this is the perfect computer for you."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "Be aware of current and upcoming space limitations.  Lots of reviews here are from a few years ago when Win 8.1 was in use.  The hard drive is only 32GB and usable space is around 28GB.  Win 10 uses about 20GB of space.  That leaves maximum of 8GB for any non-OS programs (thats if you remove all the crapware and keep all your media on an SD card).  Next bloated update for Win 10 is \"creator\" update which will take another 4GB away.  Remember, external storage is just for media-pics/movies/books.  You need space on your hard drive for system programs and soon there will not be any left.  Why HP still sells with such a small hard drive is a good question and one they avoid by blaming Microsoft.  But regardless of blame, if you don't have space for your operating system, the machine won't work. Also, the hard drive and RAM are soldered onto motherboard so they can't be replaced or upgraded.\nI've had this laptop for about 6 months.  I bought it to have a standalone laptop for banking, online shopping, and letters.  It has worked well so far but I fear the small hard drive will make it unworkable within another 6 months"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I needed a laptop ASAP and was attracted to the low price and simplicity of this computer. It still works fine after two years, but it's became a real clunker. The processor is slow and there is very little memory, and more than half of that is taken up by System and Temp files that you can't delete. It's by far the slowest computer I've ever owned and I regularly cannot run apps because of the low memory. I've transferred most everything to external storage and have deleted everything I can, but it's still a major issue. This laptop is a decent value if it's really all you can afford, but I wish I had not gone so low-end and spent a little more money to get a better machine. I would not purchase one again."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I've had this laptop for almost two years and I've been using it for school and personal use the entire time. I've written up several papers on this and have watched Netflix, browsed the internet, and have had several (6-8) tabs open at a time while doing research and it's worked fine (slowed down a tiny bit after hitting like 7 tabs, but those were all research papers and google pages). It's served it's purpose for non-intensive work and it still is. Heading into freshman year of college and hopefully this laptop lasts for a while longer. It was a good, cheap investment by a high school student working part-time and I recommend it for any one who needs the essentials to get through school or have a laptop of some kind to use. Windows 8 is O.K. but that's about it. Battery life isn't super great but it lasts long enough for me to find an outlet."}

I never planned on doing anything more than doing basic tasks (internet, Skype, etc.) and for that it handles extremely well. Every now and then it'll slow down, but I can't complain for the price that I paid for it. The storage is kind of a problem, but I've gotten accustomed to using the cloud, but there is an microSD card slot to expand the storage. Speakers aren't anything fantastic, but the battery life is, and I never have to worry about it dying for a while. The computer is also pretty durable, I'm not afraid to drop it or such. I like the finish on the exterior of it, and the grips on the bottom of the computer are useful to have. Keys are nothing special, and the trackpad is a tiny bit small. Overall, I really can't complain for the price that I paid for it.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I've had this lil laptop about a year and it works well for internet browsing, word processing and basic computing. I see a lot of reviews with 1 or 2 starts but it seems that they were expecting way too much. 2GB RAM means you can't have a dozen programs running at once. So if you're the kind of person who likes to have a ton of internet tabs open with a few PDF's , word docs, a chat session, etc. then YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEMS WITH IT RESPONDING SLOWLY. Do not buy this if you needs a serious workhorse PC. It's definitely not a gaming PC either. You can optimize it by deleting the bloatware the comes per-installed and there's an SD slot to expand the memory for pics, videos, music & documents. I recommend this PC for one who's on a budget that don't require much multitasking. It does handle light multi-tasking pretty well. Like I use it for my online college studies and typically open 3 to 5 browser tabs, stream a video lecture up to 90 minutes, have 2 word docs and 2 or 3 PDF's open all at once no trouble at all. I also use it to stream Netflix and Amazon music or videos when I'm not doing schoolwork. For under $200 it's an attractive PC that comes with 1year of MS Office 365, and Windows 10."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "Like others have said, it's really slow, even for just writing papers and browsing the internet. The keyboard isn't good either in that it doesn't have a nice feel and also, for me, the spacebar sticks all the time. The laptop is so slow that my text is often behind and I have to go back and correct what I wrote after it catches up (and also add spaces where the spacebar stuck, which is practically every other word). I bought mine almost two years ago and it is still in nearly new condition, but only because I rarely use it  and I only use it if I'm really desperate. Well, I can't say that either. Once it was so bad and I needed to have something typed up that I switched to my phone, opened up Google docs, and started using voice-to-text, which worked much better and I had far less text to correct. I really regret not using it enough when I first purchased it to notice any of these issues because now I'm stuck with this piece of junk. This was the first HP product I've ever bought and now that I'm looking for a new laptop, I'm wary of purchasing anything else by them. Kind of looking at the Dell Latitudes."}

I knew the RAM wasn't uber-great so I added a micro card to hold my media and a couple of programs that I use on a regular basis. That seemed to do the trick. Until the most recent Windows 10 update came out. I've removed everything I can; I've even tried putting the Windows 10 upgrade on the micro card - and my work is still frequently interrupted by messages that the update can't be installed because there's not enough memory. Kinda getting sick of that. If I have more than a couple of tabs open in my browser, or several documents open at the same time, Windows starts nagging me shut things down because - guess why? - the computer is low on memory. Sure, I love the color of this laptop, but if I had it to do over again, I would get something that could actually handle what I need it to do."}

I didn't think it would require a powerful laptop to do these things and theoretically it shouldn't. This laptop is so absolutely miserable to work with. Even if you remove all of the bloatware, it's so painfully slow and it doesn't handle basic browsing all that well either.\nPros:\n- it's cheap\n- it's cute\n- it's lightweight\n\nCons:\n- painfully slow even while doing the bare minimum\n- the cheapness shows\n- can't multitask\n- trackpad and mouse set up is a bit weird (there's no designated left or right click, you just have to hope for the best that you get the right one when you click something)\n\nBottom line:\nDespite the price point, it's not even remotely close to worth it. Save your money, get a different laptop."}

I have to admit I did a little research and had very low expectations for this based on the ridiculously stupidly small hard drive (smaller than most iPhones!!!!) and all the other horrible specs but I was looking for something windows based and inexpensive just to program a home automation system. Even after removing all the junk(with the exception of the PC itself) off the hard drive that has about 20GB of space to use after clearing off all the pre installed garbage and yet it still would not run a simple windows program. It takes forever to do any simple task including just powering itself on. I have 100Mbps internet service and going online is like using dial up service. I know the price is very inexpensive but I would recommend saving up or spending more as this computer is sure to disappoint. I finally decided the best and only way to get any enjoyment out of this device was to smash it against the wall after owning it for less than two weeks and I have to say I am now happy again:) This PC will make anyone that does not have an over abundance of patience want to take a trip to a bridge."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I purchased this laptop for my girlfriend who has return to college. It has been a fiasco almost from the beginning. The lack of storage and ram I knew when I bought it. The unexpected problems popped up when Office 365 suddenly quit. It turns out the licence was for 1 month trial rather than a year. Called up microsoft to fix the problem. while they reloaded 365 several bits of malware slipped in (past the also included McAfee) including 4 trojans and 1600+ PUPs. It took Malwarebytes to find and fix them and CCleaner to fix the registry. Also at the same time, the WiFi range suddenly dropped to less than 20 feet in line of sight of the router. As this all happened with the reloading of Office365, we have assumed that this is a MS problem. We've spend hours on the phone, chatting with them and working on our own with no progress. Today the tech support guy tried to update windows 10. Found out the update required 40GB of hard disk space! That alone makes no sense, let alone that the hard drive on this machine is 32GB and could accomodate it. Image that one of the world's most respected PC manufacturers and the makers of the worlds largest operating system can't manage to match the hard drive size to the operating system requirements. At least we were able to update all the drivers (including for the network adapter). I guess I'll look for answers from independent sources on the internet, since the makers of the operating system have none to offer. Girlfriend is ready to chuck the thing and get an Apple."}

The windows version on it wasn't the best utilization of resources and felt kind of buggy and extremely slow. When the wife picked it out, she didn't know much about drive sizes, so she didn't think twice about a 32GB SSD.\nI can expect the slow processor and ram because of the type of laptop it is, but the size of the SSD is just ridiculous even if you mainly do cloud data.  32GB sounds adequate until you factor in that windows 8.1 takes up almost 18GB of space. It really isn't enough space left with everything else to do much with it.\n\n32GB SSD\n------------------------\n18GB windows 8.1\n4GB of bloatware HP software and addons\n2GB of caching space to help the woefully inadequate ram\n----------------\n24GB - 32GB = 8GB left for actual use.\n\nOnce you install a document suite like Microsoft 360 or live, you really only have like 5GB to work with, which is definitely not enough for a college student."}

I do not use it for gaming or anything extreme but I use it for all my schoolwork and it has done great. You can't expect too much from this computer for the price but it is a nice basic laptop.

The laptop was a great investment because of the time I have had it, I used it every day and never had any problem. It holds a charge just like the day I got it. But I have never left it on the charger for extended hours because that damages the battery.

I'm not much of a PC gamer so not being able to download games doesn't bother me though. Basically this PC is good for typing and doing light internet browsing so that's all I use it for. Although it is very annoying that I can't even watch YouTube videos without constant buffering.\n\nAfter a few months, it stopped installing updates because it ran out of space. At first I had downloaded QQ, Google Chrome, Python, Skype, Teamview, etc but it's like the PC kept getting worse performance wise. So after uninstalling all the unnecessary software that came with the PC, I didn't bother to download any extra stuff. Also, the font is annoyingly tiny. I wear glasses so I never thought this would be a problem. But with this PC I sometimes just keep the icons large and zoom the pages in when I'm in a browser.\n\nI'm not even going to try to put extra money into the HP stream. I'm already looking for something much better as this thing can't even seem to handle the bare basics. This becomes more obvious over a relatively short amount of time. I wouldn't mind spending more money for a well-built PC that truly delivers; one that runs smoothly with a decent amount of specs and space. Looking back, I feel like I wasted my money and wish I hadn't bought this in the first place. If you're a writer who is only going to use this PC to write all day and may need to watch an inspirational video once in a blue moon, the HP stream is for you."}

The only major complaint I have about this product is the storage space. even with minimal items on the computer, there's not even enough space for the 8gb required to upgrade Windows 10. I keep minimum files on the computer and have almost no additional programs on the computer. I'd say I get about 4/32 GB to actually use. This doesn't work well for photo editing. I'm not sure if it's the screen size or resolution... or both. But this computer still fulfills my needs. If you run a lot of programs at once or plan to store a lot of things, this is not for you. Having had this and a netbook previously, these are not the computers to use if you're looking for a primary computer because they can not handle what a full sized computer can.  This is great for a college student that needs to take notes in class or for someone who travels a lot or has a job where they are taking their computer to various locations and can do their work through a program like Google Docs or through minimal additional programs on the computer."}

I was hoping to use it for lightweight development, tried Ubuntu but there was too much lag between tiny IDEs and the general window management. The best success I've had on it, is running older classic games via WINE on Linux (Mint specifically). Seems to run Diablo II alright.

When comparing it to both my Acer and Samsung Chromebooks, holy crap, this thing makes me want to tear my hair out. It is absolutely insane how ridiculously slow it is. The trackpad really is awful as well. Thank goodness I only got this so for school papers and for the free Office 365 Subscription, because otherwise this 'laptop' is a piece of junk and not good for much of anything else. I don't even think I'd be able to watch Netflix on it. Glad to have my Chromebooks as back-ups...this will simply be used for writing papers and nothing more. DO NOT purchase to use as a main laptop or honestly for even browsing the web, you'll be waiting forever for pages to load. I actually am writing this review on a Chromebook, because it was taking so long to load Amazon on the HP Stream! Sad!\n\nUPDATE: I have had this for only a few days now and the trackpad is barely functional at this point. When attempting to select things or scroll it closes windows and does all sorts of wonky things. It is extremely frustrating to the point I'm about to just toss this computer and purchase a totally different brand. I decided it would be cheaper to just purchase a cheap wireless mouse and see if I can put up with the slowness and small capacity of the computer still since I only use it for writing and printing papers. If I continue to have issues I am DONE with this thing. So far it has been nothing but problems. Nice one getting me to purchase another accessory HP, ugh."}

I thought the computer was dead and had to replace it, which was a pain. But it came back to life. It worked okay for awhile but the current thing I am experiencing: serious trackpad issues where you'll just hover over a button and it'll push that button without you wanting it. You have to be especially careful with sending emails and social media, etc. Because it'll just do actions whether you like them not. And the most recent problem is it resizes the screen down to a miniscule font for no apparent reason. The keyboard is difficult, since the keys are short and stubby and very loose. I also can't for the life of me figure out how to connect a printer to this laptop. Lastly, HP has gotten caught doing very sneaky things in which they make it so their printers only accept HP print cartridges, which is unethical.

It is likely that those who made such high reviews only had the laptop for a few days. I'm not going to sugarcoat it; it's a piece of crap. It's a $100 laptop, and you are going to receive a computer worth $100. Here is a list of my personal complaints...keep in mind, I've had the computer for about a year and a half now:\n\n-Storage: absolutely atrocious. In the first few days of owning it, I already had issues with running out of space. I've gone around the issue with using flash drives, but I've already gone through 2, and I'm no longer willing to buy anymore or purchase an external hard drive.\n-Unfixable driver issue: I've had a driver issue for a few months now where I can no longer use the trackpad. I've tried everything I can on my own. I've just had to resort to using keyboard shortcuts and a wireless mouse.\n-Overheating: this laptop does not have a fan. I repeat, this laptop DOES NOT have any sort of cooling mechanism. It gets extremely hot, and, as a result, one of my USB ports melted a little and is sometimes unusable. I'm actually surprised the whole thing hasn't caught on fire yet.\n-Memory: also deplorable. My laptop can no longer perform regular scans, leaving it vulnerable to malware. Other applications that need to be automatically updated regularly also cannot do so.\n\nThe ONLY reason I am giving this product 2 stars rather than 1 is due to the price. If you're stingy and are only willing to put $100 into a brand new laptop, you're going to get what you pay for: absolute garbage. As a result, the price is fair."}

The 2GB memory is not the best but works.  If you are looking for something inexpensive and easy to travel with to complete school work then this is a decent option."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I've had this for about a week and a half, and have used it almost every day. I teach college writing, so I wanted a smaller computer to grade papers (offline if necessary), create word documents, answer emails, and occasionally watch YouTube videos.\n\nThis certainly does everything I need it to, and I've overall happy with this inexpensive laptop.\nA few notes:\n-The bottom runs warm, but not actually hot, since there is no fan.\n-the battery hasn't died on me; I've used it for up to 4 hours in a day.\n-I don't recommend installing Chrome browser. When I did this, my computer slowed significantly. There were significant delays in word processing every few seconds, where I would not be able to type. I found that Chrome kept running background programs. Since it's a smaller computer with less memory and overall power, those background programs really messed things up. When I uninstalled Chrome and installed Mozilla Firefox instead, the speed problems resolved.\n-I haven't noticed a huge problem with sound, as others have, but it's not the best quality--it IS an inexpensive, small computer after all.\n-My keys don't stick and the keyboard is quite comfortable for me to use, writing 4-5 pages at a time."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I am a very broke college student, so if you are like me and need a machine to do the bare minimum, you could probably still find a better cheap laptop. I bought it knowing it would be a subpar laptop, but I liked the color and design and had limited money or time to build my own tower. The track pad is infuriating beyond my wildest expectations, constantly zooms me in and out of web pages when I don't want it to or right clicks even when I am solidly clicking on the left hand side. I highly recommend getting a microsd card for storage and not downloading anything heavy software wise. No photoshop, no gaming, probably not even Skype. It lags sometimes and is slow in general, works best when I keep it under 5 tabs on a web browser. If you are anything above broke and in desperate need of a computer, choose another laptop."}

She loves this computer and blue is her favorite color. So then I decided to buy one for myself too since I needed a laptop. I love it as well and in fact I am writing this review on the computer!!! I love the color and the simplicity of this little computer. The screen is the perfect size and the computer is nice and light. The only thing I wish it had was Microsoft word, but I'm learning to use Google Docs more because of it and I find that I like Google Docs. I like that it saves my work so I do not have to. I would recommend this computer to anyone as a gift to buy for someone or just to have a laptop for yourself. Two thumbs up!!!"}

I'm not an expert, but I know enough about computers that I knew I wasn't buying something from the top shelf. With the old processor, the 2GBs of RAM, and the 32GB ssd, I knew it wouldn't be speedy or good for multitasking or gaming. I knew it wouldn't be able to hold a lot of programs or be able to run Adobe smoothly. With that being said, don't buy this that's what you're wanting. If you're wanting to internet browse or watch a youtube video while you skype, it's going to be a little glitchy and this laptop isn't for you. It's done the small things that I needed it to. The reason I took a star was because I was expecting more from this laptop's quality. I bought this in December and the speakers are already going out, and they weren't loud enough in the first place. There are also a few keys that are starting to go out as well. Lastly, I didn't know HALF of the ssd storage would be dedicated to the windows 8.1 system along with quite a few of its non-deletable programs and apps.  It left me very little space for any additional programs, apps, music, or documents."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I gave this laptop 3 stars because it's not bad or amazing either. It's your basic laptop with all the specs needed to search the net or go on social media or type anything. For the price the laptop offers a lot. The color of mine is the blue one, which is very sleek and a smooth look. It's very light, so carrying it around is not a hassle. Also it comes with a year of free Office 365 which is great for all the work I do in college. This laptop does do some gaming, but I would not recommend to clutter this computer with a ton of It. Streaming works well with Netflix and YouTube. Also the quality of the sound is pretty good! Also the brightness adjustment is perfect. The battery life is a big pro because it last 7+ hours. Meaning I could use the laptop all day without using a charger. Only thing I do not like is that the keyboard does not light up, but like I said, for the price you pay for what you get. The size is nice and the keyboard is put together well, the mouse pad is basic,  but you cant click on the top of it. Only can access lower left and right. Overall I recommend this laptop for schooling or just everyday use! Good luck!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I bought model 11-R014WM but not from Amazon.  I considered a Chromebook, but wanted to use this for work when I travel.  The HDD is 32Gb of eMMC of which about 16 was available.  This model came with Windows 10 installed.  This was the difference for me.  Windows versus Android.  If all I was going to do was browse web sites, either would have been fine.  But with Windows 10 on it, I am able to do everything I could on my main computer.\nIn addition, I tend to play World of Warcraft in my off-hours.  Wow requires 45Gb of disk to be installed.  So I bought a 64Gb SD card and inserted it in the Stream.  I installed the application there.  Posts from other users say it will not work and that you need an external SSD connected to the USB 3.0 port.  I can tell you this is not true.  OK, I did turn some of the Video settings down, but the game runs fine.\n\nThis model comes with a 802.11n wifi card.  Therefore, don't go looking to connect to a 5g wireless connection as it is not supported.  But let's face it, I had Fios 30/30 at my old home (moved in June 2016).  I now have Comcast with 75/10 speeds.  Either way, a wireless \"N\" adapter is more than enough."}

He talked about how it was so portable and light, and it was completely fanless and ventless! It even had an SSD! I decided to buy it, and when I got home, (I bought it at Walmart) I opened up the box and was very pleased. I liked the color of the purple, and I loved how it included a USB 3.0 port, as well as an older USB port. It ran Windows 10, which was a massive improvement from Windows Vista. It had 2 GB or RAM, which was also an improvement, and it had a nice 1.60 GHz processor. It also included a 32 GB solid state drive, which was a very large improvement from the hard drive that was in my old laptop. I didn't really like using the trackpad, but that wasn't a problem since I had already purchased a wireless USB mouse.\n\nAll in all, I love my laptop, and it works fine for what I wanted it for.

To be clear, I'm not trying to do anything other than have a tab up for email, usually one for a google doc, and one or two for regular internet pages.\n\nPros:\n*Lightweight, slim\n*Attractive: the violet case really appealed to me and looks great\n*Price point: excellent\n\nCons:\n* Slow. Can't handle multiple processes at the same time\n* Track pad just stops working sometimes\n* Not really good for even just basic internet browsing, unless you're the kind of person who only has one tab open at a time\n\nI just ordered a Samsung Chromebook 3 to replace this.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "Chose this based on previous experience with HP products being robust and reliable. And it seemed a good choice - for about a week. Don't let it do HP updates, especially if you're using a browser at the same time.  My daughter was working in Google Drive (Chrome) when she got an alert saying the laptop needed to install updates. Not Windows updates - no, these were for the backup software HP puts on their machines, and the alert comes complete with orange exclamation points, to give it a sense of urgency. It was a legitimate update - for those who think it was a malware issue. It's HP's \"helper\" applications.  She okayed the update and went back to work.  Or tried to. As soon as the install process got underway, the browser slowed and became unresponsive. She asked me to take a look. Chrome was  frozen and wouldn't close. Task manager wouldn't open. The updates were also frozen. Then we saw the 'restart' image. We thought \"Good -  it'll OK after restarting\" - but it never restarted. The swirling 'restarting' graphic just stayed until the screen went dark. Power button remains lit, but the computer doesn't do anything. It's a day later, and we've still got a black screen and a lit power button. Unit is sealed, so we can't try the old-fashioned fix of disconnecting the battery to force a restart. Ctrl-Alt-Delete, holding the power butting - nothing has any effect. It's bricked. They need a 'reset' switch like an old calculator. Or they need to build their products properly. My daughter liked it (while it lasted), but Amazon didn't offer a replacement - only a refund.\n\nUPDATE: Cycling the power is the fix for this problem, you just can't do it easily. While boxing the unit for return a day and a half after the issue described above, I noticed the power light had finally gone out (the battery had run down). I plugged the computer in and, after a minute, was able to start it.  One star added, as it didn't stay dead."}

If it worked long enough to get the bloatware out, maybe I could have improved the performance but mine failed... and quality (or lack of) is one of the cons. Let's take a look at the pros and cons on this laptop...\n\nPros: Compact and lightweight is a major plus. The blue finish is a turn-off but looks a lot better in person (and when open) and is also easy to spot and keep an eye on - consider these vivid colors a theft deterrent. Keyboard feel is very intuitive - had no issues fresh out of the box with setup typing. Touchpad is 2 finger scroll - you move both fingers vs. keep one stationary and move the other. Display is bright and clear, obviously limited in resolution but acceptable. Takes a microSD card for storage of music / pictures / documents. Can't vouch for battery life as mine failed before a single charge could be used, which takes us to the down sides...\n\nCons: Just not powerful enough to run Windows 10 - just can not do it. These specs would make for a great Chromebook, but this just chokes beyond words for even basic email and browsing. Truly dissapointed as I wasn't expecting much and received even less performance than my limited expectations. Note that I purchased this to replace a Chromebook, which was FAST but I am simply away from WiFi too much to have a Chromebook work for me. I can not vouch for the battery life as I did not get a single charge worth of use before mine failed. Flickering display, keyboard hanging up (I suspect a touch-pad issue caused the keyboard problem) - well it is going back,\n\nOverall, I am dissapointed. I see these as refurbs and understand why! The build quality is just not there. I can't recommend this laptop simply as the reliability is really questionable. This may be a laptop that dies before it becomes outdated."}

I will definitely consider another HP like this when my son is responsible enough for one."}

I had to remove a lot of features I didn't want and reset the touchpad settings so that it would respond the way I wanted to and deactivate the features that are built into windows which assume that you are using a touchscreen, which this computer doesn't come with. After you change all those settings it's great. Runs silent and about 8+ hours on battery, but that's just for typing papers and reading books and light web surfing. If you do heavy gaming and video streaming it will run out faster. It's light, fits in my backpack with lots of books, I can carry it around in one hand if I have to. I bought it when it first appeared in the store, before it had been advertised, so it was really cheap at the time and I've had it ever since."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I was swayed by the low price of this machine but really wish I'd done more research first. I don't like it.\nFirst, the few positives:\nIt's very lightweight and it comes in a pretty color. The screen is bright and clear. Start up was very easy.\nIt goes downhill from there. I only needed this thing to do a few basic functions. Surf the web, play the occasional youtube video, and be the interface between my camera and the web when I travel and take photos, which I then need to upload to social media or online storage. It's kind of amazing how badly it performs at these tasks.  The biggest issue is that it only has 32 GB of memory and Windows 10 and all the stupid apps take up nearly HALF of it. The machine runs slow from the outset and didn't really improve even after I went in and deleted as much crap as I could. With so little available memory and already poor performance, I'm going to have to store all my files in a back up drive. Forget downloading a few movies to take on the airplane. And here's the kicker: YOU CAN'T UPGRADE IT. Neither the memory nor the RAM is upgradable in this machine, which is OBNOXIOUS.\nHere's another thing I find annoying: it has a micro SD slot but no standard SD slot. Why???  My camera uses a standard SD. I have no devices that use a micro SD. I don't know why you'd have one and not the other.\nLastly, the touchpad is not great. A light tap does not suffice to select something - you really have to tap it HARD. And sometimes even that doesn't work."}

I'll be blunt and say that disappointed is an understatement. As others have mentioned, the bloatware and junk that comes installed on the laptop slow down performance considerably, even if you have zero files you need to save locally. I will admit, however, that I haven't worked to remove all the bloatware and reinstall Windows as some others have. (In my mind, you shouldn't have to spend 2 hours configuring a brand new computer just so it works faster.)\n\nAnd yes, you're encouraged to use the Microsoft cloud service to save your files, but heaven forbid you prefer to use systems like Evernote or Dropbox. By the time you install their desktop software, you're at 98% of your drive's capacity (literally). Plus, who should have to expand the memory of a new computer simply to work on Word docs and surf the web? My phone and tablet are more reliable and faster, even when everything is on my secure home wi-fi.\n\nBest of all, the internal battery completely crapped out and died this week. The computer simply will not work unless it's plugged in, and every boot up gives me a DOS screen telling me to contact HP because the battery won't charge.\n\nNo thanks. I'm cutting my losses and going back to a lower-end Lenovo with an internal hard drive and substantial memory. It's only about $70 more, and at least then, I'll be able to do things like write and record podcasts on my computer (and not wait 10 seconds for a web page to load.)"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "This laptop offers a lot for the price. I recently bought this laptop for someone and had the pleasure of using it for a week and a half.\n\nThe build:\nThe stream 11 has a good and solid build for $200. The outer shell is a matte smooth plastic the doesn't attract fingerprints like other shiny/glossy laptops in this price range. The HP logo in the middle adds a nice contrast but can be destracting when sitting I high lighted places.\n\nThe internals:\nThe stream has a Intel Celeron and 2 gigs of ram, witch I found were good for browsing the internet, sending emails, and streaming YouTube. However when I was streaming a YouTube video in 720 p while reading a e-book and editing a document on Microsoft word, the video started to get choppy and the typing input was delayed. The internal storage on the model I bought was 32gb, this was a lowered to about 19 GB when windows was fully updated and installed. The 19gb was usable for storing documents, pictures, and low quality video. You wouldn't want to install bulky programs like Photoshop on this as it would take up too much memory and and would run slow due to the 2 gigs of ram. However I bought a 16 gig SD card for 10 bucks to add some storage just in case.\n\nExternals:\nThe HP stream has a 1366x768 screen that doesn't look bad for its price. However the screen is considerably dim making it hard to use in bright environments. The keyboard is respectable for $200, but is quite mushy and has low key travel. The track pad is a little laggy but supports Windows 10 multi-gesture functions. The speakers are a reasonable volume but can be quite tinny.\n\nOverall I think this laptop deserves 4 stars as it is affordable and a good gift for children or anybody who doesnt need to do heavy editing or gaming."}

The laptop is super slow even tho the description says it is like 2.16 ghz processor speed. It is more like 1.00 ghz if you are lucky. Opening more than one tab makes it even slower. The speakers are not that good, they time out sometimes. Battery life is good. When you charge it and use it at the same time, the bottom gets really hot. There is so much unnecessary programs on the laptop which consumes all Memory.  NOW the most ANNOYING part of this laptop is that since the memory capacity is very low, a frequent dialogue box opens up and tells you to shut down your laptop since \"your computer is low on memory\". Well, REALLY? Maybe because the manufacturers put crap in the computer that is not needed. This is NOT worth 200 dollars but is worth 80 or less. There is a reason why HP is going out of business. They suck at making laptops and computers. Stick with DELL. I would never get google chrome books since GOOGLE spies on people but Chromebooks are a lot faster."}

It's lightweight and streamlined and the keyboard has nice action for the style.\n\nThe downside is that I received the Windows 10 version. Windows 10 is simply way too much OS for this little machine. I attempted to remove as much bloat as possible and Win10 still occupies a huge chunk of the SSD and wants loads of RAM. As I write this in Chrome with only one tab open it's using 58% RAM. With Amazon, Gmail, and Google Docs, open I'm hitting a steady 83% RAM. I know Chrome can be a hog but those are pretty typical cloud work apps and I don't even have Slack or Telegram open yet.\n\nSince my personal intended use for this machine is cloud work and webdev I am seriously considering to wipe it and install Ubuntu or Debian, if I'm feeling adventurous, or invest in a copy of Windows 7.\n\nSo if you are considering this machine get the Windows 8.1 version and follow the other review here that explains how to remove a lot of the crapware - it's really useful. Don't get the Win10 version or upgrade to Win10! Otherwise, it's a great little laptop for the price range."}

There is no number keypad.  You better use the cloud because the storage is limited.  You definitely want to clear those temp files and any old versions of windows.  My deal came with a year of Windows and Microsoft Suite but not sure what it will cost me after the year is up.  This maybe a way for microsoft to create a new income stream.  The darker blue color is awesome.  So thankful that the laptop has a matte non-slip finish.  You will definitely need to disable some of the annoying features that are defaults for the touch pad.  The screen is not a touch screen.  Battery life is OK.  You can definitely go more than 4 hours without a charge.  I would recommend this to a friend."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I chose to buy this laptop(s) for one express purpose: writing. I wanted a portable laptop with good battery life and an excellent keyboard (writing, remember?). After doing a lot of research (and I mean, a lot) I decided I would buy an HP Stream 11. I went to the store and actually bought two Stream 11 laptops because there was a 50% discount on the second HP laptop that you buy. This has given me a chance to look at two different physical models and get a clearer idea of shared problems.\n\nSPECS: both my laptops are the 2nd generation (Fall 2015, N3050 1.6 processor) and both came with Windows 10 installed with minimal bloatware, but in my region, they did NOT come with the 1 year of MS Office, so I am not even factoring that into my rating.\n\nBODY: these little laptops are gorgeous. The casings are nice, and the colors are perfect. The blue is bright and shiny, the purple is just the right hue to be attractive and not (too) unprofessional or girly. Either color would be fine for the buyer, just based on your preference.\n\nSCREEN: I've read many complaints about the screen and most are unfounded (maybe the 1st gen Stream was worse). The screen can achieve a good brightness and 11.6 inches really isn't too small to do most single tasks. If your usage depends on having a large screen, then this isn't the laptop for you (unless you plug it into an HDMI tv or monitor), but it's just fine for word processing and not bad when it comes to viewing websites. The resolution is not \"premium\", shall we say, but it is perfect for a screen of this size. 8-point Times New Roman is readable, just at the edge of being too grainy. Bigger text points are easily read.\n  What I particularly like about the screen is the matte-ness of it. I have another HP laptop (Envy) that has a glossy screen. While it seems that glossy screens can be brighter, they can be a real pain when it comes to working in a room where light sources reflect off your screen. For this reason, I really appreciate the matte screen in the Stream 11 and I think it's excellent.\n\nKEYBOARD: The irony that I wanted this for writing. Many reviewers had problems with the keyboard: most common is that the space-bar is unresponsive. Commenters who type \"Iamwriting thiswith mynewcomputer, asyoucan tell itdoesn't work whenIpress thespacebar\" are not kidding. I was upset that I experienced the same thing with my Stream when I first bought it. It's a shame because, otherwise, the chiclet-style keys of the Stream keyboard are excellent. There is good space between each of them, and the keys are a very nice size, almost the same size as a full-size keyboard and many professional reviewers have listed the Stream keyboard as the best of the sub-$200 laptop market.\n  So, about that space bar? It's a PHYSICAL problem with the way that the key is affixed. The severity of the unresponsiveness varies: my blue 11 needed to be pressed at the center with good pressure to register a space, left or right edges of it just wouldn't work; the purple was somewhat better: the center and left side of the space bar both managed to register a space more often than not with normal pressure. Have a laptop tech look at it, if you are having problems, and he'll notice that it's just a problem of how the space bar is mounted. It sucks to have to get a *new* laptop \"fixed\", though, so if you are averse to that, I can understand. But this is a mechanical problem and once addressed, the space bar works perfectly (you should have been able to tell by now since I am writing on my blue Stream 11). I took a look at mine at home and managed to get it working but I wouldn't recommend anyone do this: you'll probably mess it up and void your warranty for all I know.\n\nTOUCHPAD: No complaints on the touchpad. It does its job. Good size and once you adjust the sensitivity for it to cover more distance with less movement then there isn't much to be fussy about.\n\nPROCESSING POWER: this is not a powerhouse of a laptop, as I am sure you well know. It does basic things and it does them well enough. Some websites don't display as fast as I'd like. Sometimes it becomes unresponsive when a website is too resource-demanding. Most of the time, if you are doing things one at a time, the Stream 11 does a decent enough job. I would have no problem taking this around as my only internet browsing computer, but without a need for heavy graphics, I might not be able to say the same for your needs.\n\nSTORAGE CAPACITY: at 32 gb (28.1 recognized on My Computer screen) the internal memory of the HP Stream 11 is nothing impressive, but my experience is not as bad as some reviewers have suggested. While I haven't installed many programs on this laptop, I still have 11 gigabytes of free space on the internal disk. Compared to people who say they couldn't even update Windows any more...I'm just not sure how that has happened to them.\n  But if your computer usage involves large data files, you will have to expand the memory (preferably with the Micro-SD card slot) because there is very little that you can do with those 10~11 gigabytes before they finish. It's better to save those for as much system-related use as possible.\n\nBATTERY LIFE: I have not had a chance to really put this laptop to the test when it comes to battery life (full charge, then time how long it actually lasts) but my usage with it has shown me that it is capable of going many hours. Refer to another review if you want details on battery life, but I have not found anything to complain about.\n\nCAM AND MIC: I haven't had any reason to use the camera, but you can be sure it's not that great. The microphones, on the other hand, were surprisingly good, without any static that I could hear from the speakers.\n\nSPEAKERS: Pretty good for a budget computer. They are loud enough and of a decent quality as well.\n\nTHE GOOD: for the light-intensity work that I bought this computer for, I have to say that I am absolutely impressed. Affordability, style, versatility, portability; the HP Stream really is a work of art. If this is the only computer you can afford, well, you're in luck. I do not regret my purchase at all.\n\nTHE BAD: the keyboard/space-bar problem can be a huge pain. If you are unlucky (and both laptops I bought had bad space-bars) it's likely that you will find yourself with this problem. As I said, this is a mechanical problem and can be fixed by someone who knows how laptop keyboards work. The only other problems are the weak processor and the small hard disk.\n\nWho would I recommend this laptop to? Anyone that is on the go a lot and wants something that is portable and long-lasting, and doesn't have high processing demands (gaming/design/rendering/etc.) Basically, any student who doesn't want to use this for gaming will find great value in it, so would any adult that is fine using the basic functions of a computer and not AutoCAD or some other resource-heavy software."}

The mouse pad is just horrible, it is sticky and its hard to slide against it.\nBUT after around a month of use, I got used to it, but having a better mouse pad would have been amazing.\nAnother problem was the creaking, when you open the computer, it sounds like it will break, or it is too fragile, and although it hasn't broken, it always seems like it will with a little force.\nBut overall this is an amazing computer, with a few cons.\nEverything else about this has seemed amazing, from the speed to the apps, they are all amazing and worth it for the price!"}

Now it runs slowly, it goes back to the log-in screen itself and doesn't work as well as before. It's a good choice is your patience doesn't run out quickly. It only came with 28.2 GB of storage, so you might want to get an HP Pavilion if you want more space.\nUPDATE:\n\nI tried to reset it and it just keeps restarting, and I can't get it to work, it just says the HP logo, and goes black ,HP, black ,etc.\nBuy a Lenovo Ideapad 110.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "Keep in mind that you are ordering a $179 dollar computer. With that said, for the price it is a good deal but the price reflects the performance, and from what I have seen in the last couple of months of heavy usage, not the quality. The quality for the price is excellent. I have not had any quality control issue. When you receive your computer the first thing I'd suggest you do is start deleting any program that you will not be using. The CPU is not powerful at all and it does lag sometimes. You can have programs running in the background you may not be aware are running. Also, don\"t forget to buy a large micro SD card. The hard drive is small and it will fill up fast if you do not have a micro SD. If you have used Linux (Ubuntu) i'd consider installing it. It probably takes a lot less resources to run. With all that said, I would recommend this computer."}

They had her ship the computer to their repair center. It is still under manufacturer warranty, but they are refusing to fix it under that warranty because they are trying to say the problems were caused by \"accidental damage.\" They tried over and over again to get my wife to say that she damaged the computer by dropping it or setting something heavy on top, which she did not! She took great care of that computer and kept it in a protective case. They said they would fix it, but we had to pay $350! That's $130 more than what we paid for the computer in the first place! We talked to 6 different people from HP, and the  most they would do was give us a 50% discount on the repairs...which is still almost as much as we paid for the computer!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "For the last several years, I've used a heavy-duty Alienware gaming laptop for most of my computing needs. However, at a massive 17 inches and weighing something over ten pounds, this computer is understandably massive. That, combined with how expensive it is, made it a very inconvenient thing to bring along with me when I traveled, even if it was a trip by vehicle, but especially if I had to take a flight, as I do rather frequently.\n\nI've learned through experience that when on a vacation or traveling that, if I do happen to get my laptop out, the purposes I most commonly use it for are browsing the internet or maybe working on a novel-- wi-fi in most places is too shoddy to play any of my games, and I'm usually far too occupied to start a session anyway. I also wanted something that I could keep next to the table in my room, to fool around on while watching television before bed.\n\nAs such, I was looking for some sort of solution to this issue-- a computer that could do what I wanted to, primarily browsing the internet, but with enough power to simultaneously do that, and maybe have ZenWriter open as well. And this little computer does all of that and more. It's a pleasant and eye-catching color, but more than that, it's incredibly light-- I can fit it into a bookbag of most sizes with relative ease. Because it's got such a light frame, it's no trouble to carry around, and because it's comparatively so cheap to my main laptop, I didn't need to fret about what might happen if it were to get lost on a vacation.\n\nIf there's one drawback to be had with this little laptop, it's the hard drive space. By the time I finished installing some programs and bringing some music onto it, I was running dangerously low on hard drive space. However, I expanded it with a 128GB MicroSD card, so that problem was easily solved.\n\nIn summation, if you're a power-user like I am, this laptop isn't for you. However, if you're looking for a small laptop to have around to do simple tasks on, somewhere between a tablet and a more serious laptop, you won't find a much better choice."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "So let's be honest, it is what it is -- a $200 computer. If you are willing to accept the shortcomings that come at that price point -- it's pretty impressive what they were able to stuff into what is a fun little device. I'm intending to use it as a coffee table computer, and the blue color adds a nice accent. The screen is the old-school matte type. It's reminiscent of the old Apple iBook, except lightweight with a modern OS. A few things, and a few tips: 1) Taking one star off as the device is pretty slow upon first use, and frustratingly so. To the point of almost being unusable. What I surmised is this is due to the amount of crapware that HP bundles in the default image (security suite, etc.). However with a little work this can be fixed. You can try and remove all the crapware but I simply decided to wipe & load a clean install of Windows 10 (read on before you attempt to do this). 2) The Stream comes with 1 free year of Office 365, which is pretty awesome. YOU MUST ACTIVATE/REDEEM THIS VIA THE START MENU FROM THE FACTORY INSTALL. If you do a clean install of Windows, and forget to do this first, you are out of luck! 3) Now, if you decided to wipe & reload Windows, after making sure you activated Windows and Office, use Microsoft's USB creation tool to create a bootable Windows 10 thumb drive. Aaaaand.... you'll find out the Stream will refuse to boot from it. This was a head-scratcher but I finally figured it out (surprisingly couldn't find a solution online). Your bootable USB *must* be formatted with GPT partitioning, and the USB boot volume must be FAT32, and you must boot via UEFI. For the nerds out there you can do this via diskpart.exe and just extract the contents of the Windows ISO to the USB stick. Once you do this, reboot then hit Esc, followed by F9 to boot from USB. 4) It seems to take 64-bit Windows ONLY. Not sure why as I thought I could get a small performance boost from 32-bit Windows (it being a 2GB RAM device and all) but it refuses to boot the 32-bit Windows installer. Perhaps it supports booting from 64-bit UEFI only. Oh well. 5) Once this is all said & done, with a fresh install of Windows it's a pretty awesome device for the price. After loading Win10, while I was searching out missing drivers from HP, lo and behold it loaded all of them automatically from Windows Update in the background. Give it some time & a few reboots but it will find everything. Pretty cool."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "5/16/16\nA+\n\nUpdate 10/13/16\nAwful laptop. I bought this thing with the intention of using it for my online classes. I didn't care much about RAM and SSD because I have a great desktop for whatever else I need RAM for.\n\nRight off the bat, I realized the computer struggled if I had multiple tabs open on Firefox. It's slightly better with the add on that stops videos from automatically loading and playing. When I'm working on an assignment, I can't work with one tab at a time. Maybe I have high expectations and don't think realistically?\n\nThis has been enough of an issue that I opted to look into expansion options, which is insane because I'm just browsing the web. (God forbid if I have Word open too, and trying to flip between that and the browser)\n\nBut this laptop is not expandable in any way.\n\nOkay. So now I'm back to figuring out how to free up RAM usage. I disabled everything that came pre-loaded onto the laptop, uninstalled what I could.\n\nWhich brings me to my next complaint. You know how irritating it is that cell phones come pre-loaded with apps you can't remove? It's more regulated now, but I remember how infuriating it was to be unable to remove NASCAR garbage from my phones. Microsoft and HP decided to run with that idea though, and my laptop is FULL of crap on the hard drive that I don't have the option of removing, only disabling.\n\nIt says 32 GB SSD. However, the usable space is 28 GB. I've only loaded Kaspersky Total Security, Skype and Firefox. The current available SSD I have is 1.48 GB. I don't save pictures, documents, etc to the drive, I use external storage.\n\nI will reload factory installed software today and hopefully get rid of the junk I can't remove myself. I shouldn't have to read Amazon answers and do research on how to make the computer run better, and go through factory resets. This is ridiculous, and in 5 months I haven't had much opportunity to sit down and mess with all this. It's easier to just use my desktop at this point.\n\nHowever, I have software/driver issues as well, though I hope resetting the system will fix them:\n\n1) I use Skype almost daily, (which runs OK if I'm not trying to use a browser at the same time) and more often than not, I have to restart my computer at some point because the sound becomes distorted. I have the computer on an external cooling fan, so it's not heat related, and this does not happen if I am using my external webcam and mic.\n\n2) Bluetooth does not work for me. Period. It took me upwards of an hour to get my earpiece/mic linked, which was difficult to do because it wasn't a straightforward, basic thing to do. I had to delve kinda deep in the system to figure out how to do it. Once I had it linked, it still didn't connect. Also, despite both the PC and my Galaxy S7 \"seeing\" each other in the systems via bluetooth, the PC won't link to the phone. I'm unable to move pictures or documents between the devices via cord connection, either (though this could be the phone, and I just got it so I haven't figured out all of its quirks/changes from my Note4.)\n\n3) As always, Java sucks and always has errors, but to be fair I don't think it works how it should on any system, ever. Shockwave also crashes and messes up.\n\n4) Certain actions just don't work. If I click on \"disable\" on some useless app, it doesn't do anything, but it will for the other apps. The \"windows\" key to open the menu doesn't always work.\n\nI just opened task manager to see what the current status is of this heap is.\n\nCPU:\n1.60 GHz max speed, but is operating at 2.00-2.15 GHz (?)\nUtilization is jumping from 50% to 100% and everywhere between every second\n77 (!) processes open\n\nMemory\n1.9GB usable, 1.7GB currently in use.\n1 of 2 slots used.\nCommitted 2.9GB/3.6GB\n\nOverall, I hate this thing, and deeply regret not spending a little more on a better product. I'll end up resetting to factory settings to get through this term and buying a better computer and handing this to the kids.\n\nAt least it connects to my printer through the wireless network. I've had no issues on that front."}

Between the crackling every time I used my earbuds I noticed that even though they were plugged in, sound was still coming through the speakers out loud which never happened with any laptop I've ever had and let me tell you, I've gone through most brands on the market!  The last straw was when I went to turn it on but nothing happened. Just the power button light and capslock blinking.  Unbelievable! And I thought dells were bad! HP stream sucks and will be added to my growing collection of dead useless computers."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "This product came with a lot of \"bugs\" - things not working as they should.  For example, it took me five tries to get the virus scanner to work.  Only one of many.  At first, I couldn't get the computer to tun off; it would go into sleep mode no matter what I did.  Then, I discovered that right-clicking on the battery icon brought up some power options.  Now, it sometimes will turn off but not always.  Very poor design in my opinion.  I really had some resource problems (the computer would not respond to any commands) until I installed Ccleaner to clean it up.  I'm just so glad that this isn't my only computer and that I have some computer knowledge.  If this wasn't the case, I would trash this thing.  I don't recommend that you waste your money on this computer.  Spend the extra bucks and get one that works without any hassle."}

This includes chrome with like, a billionty different tabs running. The display is super crisp and clear and movies and anime look great on it. The bottom does get a bit warm once it has been running more than an hour, so purchasing a cooling pad with this might be a good idea  This is a great laptop for work or school. It's good as a mobile media device as well. The only thing I wouldn't recommend this model for is for use as a video editor, or as a gaming laptop. For everything it does, this is a steal. Reasonable enough to give a child or just keep as a backup. Mine goes everywhere with me now."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "After doing some extended research I decided to buy this laptop, seeing it was exactly what I wanted. A budget laptop where I could use Microsoft Word and browse the Internet. I initially was going to get a chromebook, but I decided this was better suited for my needs. I'm a college student, so I needed Word to write essays, as well as short stories (I'm a recreational writer). Everything about this laptop seemed perfect, except the storage space. But I figured since I wouldn't be playing any games or downloading anything, that the very low 32 gb would be fine. However, it's atrocious. Without installing or downloading any apps or programs (other than Microsoft Office) the hard drive is filled to the brim, out of the box. No worries, I'll be saving all my stuff on a flash drive. What's the big deal? There's no longer enough storage space just to update windows. I'm stuck not being able to ever update the laptop unless I buy an external hard drive, which I really don't want to do. What really suck is that so far (after using it for a couple months) the laptop is actually decent. Other than some general Web browsing slowness and some pages having trouble loading, this is a pretty decent laptop. And to be honest, I'm not sure if the buggy problems I'm having is just the laptop or the fact that it hasn't been updated. I also find the keyboard to quite nice and allows me to type quickly and efficiently. If this were an outright terrible machine, I'd be upset and just get something different. But because this is actually an okay laptop with one really big problem, it's more frustrating. If this laptop didn't have such a glaring storage space problem, I would give this 4 stars. But since I do have this problem, I can't give it anything less than 1 star. If anyone who does have this laptop DID NOT have this problem, please comment and let me know. If I'm the only one with this problem, there must be a way to fix it."}

We weren't looking for a gaming unit or the latest thing out there, just a basic laptop that would let us connect to the internet easily, work at a decent speed and be able to run basic Microsoft Office programs.  We thought this one was the right one.  Unfortunately we've had continual wireless connectivity issues with it in the five months we've owned it.  All our other wireless devices will connect just fine, but this one continually cannot connect.  It finds my home network, shows a strong signal, but says it cannot connect with no reason given.  I run Network and internet diagnostics and it cannot find a problem.  I restart the computer, does not fix it.  I end up having to call tech and sometime in the half hour call with our trying everything it starts working again.  Tech tries to say it's our router or cable box; but, if this was the case, all our other devices would be having issues as well.  They all work fine when the laptop craps out.  Once it starts working again, it will last a few weeks and then the same issue happens again.  Very frustrating!!  Granted, I could have purchased the extended warranty like I did for our fancier unit, but for such a basic unit I did not think it was necessary and thought by the time it had issues a year or two down the road, we'd replace it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "01-30-2016\nI have had this laptop for a very short time, three days to be exact. So far, I am very pleased with the way that the laptop has been working. The laptop runs pretty fast browsing the web and running programs. Keep in mind when reading these reviews, a good porting of these individuals either don't care to research what they are buying and/or they have no clue about computers. Sure, there are people that have had these laptops fail on them, that is an eventuality. However, many of the reviews talking about the laptop running slow, being bad for gaming (this is just sad), or having bad storage raises a red flag to me. I have been building computers for years and can tell a good review from a bad one. This is all explained later in my review. I will try to continuously update my review as I experience this laptop over the coming months. Hopefully this laptop will continue to impress for a long time to come.\n\nConstruction/Feel:\n\nThe first thing that I noticed was that it is very slim and light. It feels like it has been constructed with good material despite it's very affordable price point. The exterior portion of the laptop has a finish that is a little coarse or rough feeling. It is actually nice because you don't feel like it will slip out of your hand and it seems somewhat scratch resistant. That's huge for me as I will be taking this laptop pretty much everywhere including work. The interior aspect of the laptop I made of aluminum with classy etching to it in various shades of  blue (purple if you get that color). It looks really nice, I would never have looked at this laptop and thought it was barely above $200. It looks and feels like it was much more expensive than that. The keyboard is designed with the buttons protruding through the aluminum plate which is nice. The buttons are white and textured in a similar way to the exterior of the laptop allowing your fingers to grip nicely as you type. It will be interesting to see how dirty the buttons look after months of use. Hopefully the texture doesn't make it hard to clean. Only time will tell. Anyway, is very comfortable to type with, you could use this laptop for hours without problem. The touchpad feels somewhat bouncy to me, but that's because I am use to a \"stationary\" touchpad that has buttons at the bottom versus a clicking touchpad. Sometimes clicking seems a tiny bit inaccurate, but it is nothing to really gripe about. It is more likely that I am hitting the touchpad too lightly (I have a very sensitive Alienware laptop). Other than that, this is a very nicely constructed laptop.\n\nBattery Life:\n\nAnother huge part of what makes this laptop so great is the battery life. I have never owned a laptop that can be under constant use and last as long as this. I have literally used this laptop for the last 4.75 hours straight browsing the web, I watched a Jurassic World, and now I am typing a review on a single charge. That's pretty amazing for a 13.3\" laptop. According to the battery life indicator (which is actually very accurate unlike some), I still have 30 minutes left with 8% battery life. Right now it is in power saving mode making it last longer than normal. Until it reached 20% battery life (that's when battery saver setting turn on), I have been running it as if it were plugged in with the screen on 100% brightness. At 10% battery life, a warning comes up stating \"you might want to plug your laptop in\" and at 8% another comes up with a similar statement. If you were running this laptop from the start in battery saving mode, you could probably get a whole lot more use from it. In fact, maybe that will be my next test.\n\nStorage:\n\nThis laptop only comes with 32GB of storage from the factory, this is not a secret and is clearly stated in the product details. It surprises me that people bought this and then give it a one star for storage capability. This situation is easily addressed as you will very soon see. The majority of that storage is used up by a combination of pre-installed programs and of course, the Windows 10 operating system. I have removed a few programs and installed one small movie player program leaving me with only 2.66GB free of 27.8GB. As you can see, there is pretty much nothing left in the way of storage. The first problem is that people don't READ and expect that this laptop (technically a netbook) has tons of storage. Not to be harsh but reading seems to be a diminishing skillset in our society. That's why I went ahead and ordered myself a 128GB micro SD card. That way anything else I may need more permanently can go there instead of on the factory internal storage. You can pick any brand you want, I decided to go with this one because it seems to be the best price for the speed:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Silicon-Power-128GB-up-to-75MB-s-MicroSDXC-UHS-1-Class10-Elite-Flash-Memory-Card-with-Adaptor-SP128GBSTXBU1V20SP/dp/B00T9QONOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Silicon Power 128GB up to 75MB/s MicroSDXC UHS-1 Class10, Elite Flash Memory Card with Adaptor (SP128GBSTXBU1V20SP)</a>. I have officially been able to install programs on this micro SD card with zero problems. I am not sure why I have seen people say that you can't, because you can. When it comes to more storage capability and INSTALLING PROGRAMS, I went with a 4TB (4000GB) portable external hard drive made by Seagate:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Seagate-Backup-Plus-4TB-Portable-External-Hard-Drive-with-200GB-of-Cloud-Storage-USB-3-0-Blue-STDR4000901/dp/B0196J3UZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Seagate Backup Plus 4TB Portable External Hard Drive with 200GB of Cloud Storage USB 3.0, Blue (STDR4000901)</a>. What's nice about this particular hard drive is that it that it is very small, and requires no external power supply, meaning that it is powered via the USB cable connected to the laptop. This is where I store my heavier files such as movies programs. I have seen people say that you can't install any programs on added/external storage. This is not always the case. I just installed a music program on this Seagate external hard drive called Guitar Pro 6 and it runs fine. It doesn't run as fast as it would if I had it on the internal storage, but it does work. I will write the steps down on how to do this below. Another cool thing about the Seagate hard drive is that there are multiple colors to choose from so that you can match it to your laptop. As you can see, storage really isn't something to be concerned about in any respect. If you want more internal storage on a laptop this size expect to spend a couple hundred more on a full-blown laptop. Now on to the computer running slow issues. This issue can have many variables. If you know your computer is clean from malicious software (cause 1), and doesn't have a lot of programs installed that boot up as your computer turns on (cause 2), it is often directly related to storage (cause 3). A computer should have a few GB (preferably more) free to operate at full capacity. Without going into detail, my custom built gaming PC will run slow if I fill the hard drive with the OS on it completely. This is not a problem with the computer, but more so that there is no \"breathing room\" for the operating system and other components to work. Throw a micro SD card in, make sure you save your files there, and save some room for your operating system. This is the main problem people run into when their computer is running slow and they aren't infested with adware/malware and other infectious programs that automatically run when you turn on your PC. If you have eliminated all of these variables, then you may be unlucky and actually have a hardware problem.\n\n****IMPORTANT**** I have discovered a way to save you 8.9GB of storage instantly and it is very easy. This computer comes with a factory reset that looks to be a way to revert it to the previous version of Windows (8.1). It will automatically delete this after a month of using this laptop. However, you can remove the files right away if you would like. Currently, with Office 365 installed, I have 9.63GB free. Plenty of space for the computer to run efficiently. From this point on, you can use either the added micro SD card for storage or your external hard drive. Keep as much space as you can free on the internal hard drive so that the laptop will run better. Keep in mind that you can use this technique do keep track of storage and delete things you don't need such as temporary files, here is how you do it:\n\n1: Go to the \"ask me anything\" search box AKA Cortana and type in \"storage\".\n2: Click on \"Storage- In system settings\"  which will have a little gear symbol.\n3: Click on \"this PC (C:) and let the system load the information\n4: Scroll to the bottom of the list and delete the 8.9GB recovery file.\n5. Restart your computer, and you will see the space is now free on your hard drive.\n\n****Installing Programs On Your External Hard Drive and Running Them On This Laptop****\n\n1: Make a folder in your external hard drive. I prefer to name the file \"Program Files (x86)\" because that is what the file is named where you normally save programs to anyway.\n\n2: Get your program, you need to either have a download code from the internet, or since this laptop has no disk drive, you need an external disc drive to initially install the program you want. Treat it as you are installing anything else you would normally install.\n\n3: When installing the program it will ask you where you want to install it which is set at Drive (C:) Program Files (x86) by default. All you have to do is change the location of the programs installation which now will be on your external hard drive under the new file you named \"Program Files (x86)\"\n\n4: Proceed with the rest of the install.\n\n5: Repeat these steps for other programs it is literally that easy.\n\nYou can use this very same method to install smaller programs on your micro SD card as well. I also found out that you can change your storage settings to automatically store apps, documents, music, pictures, and videos to your micro SD card. All you have to do is go to your system settings, storage, and scroll down to the tabs that allow you to change where these files are automatically stored. Easy right?\n\nSpeakers:\n\nThe speakers on this laptop are actually surprisingly loud. They certainly are not the loudest on the market, but for what you pay for the laptop, they get the job done.\n\nGaming:\n\nIf you are seriously considering a laptop like this for gaming, you are in the wrong place. This doesn't have the CPU, RAM, or Processor capable of giving you a good gaming experience. Sure, it will run the simple tablet games such as Angry Birds, but it simply is not designed in any way for AAA gaming. If you want a gaming laptop, be ready to spend well over $1000 for a decent one.\n\nThat is currently all that I have for now. I haven't been able to use the integrated web cam yet. I will try to get to that soon. Hopefully this review helps someone. This really is a bang for your buck laptop and I am extremely satisfied this far."}

If you want to use it as an actual computer though, you're out of luck. It has basically no internal memory. You put a few documents or photos on it and it's out of memory. If you consistently store everything on the cloud or have an external hard drive, it's fine, but if you want it to replace a real laptop, get something else. If you just want basically a monitor to stream video to, it would be a good choice."}

I have to keep XBox stuff on here which takes up a lot of space, and I don't even use Xbox.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "After reading the reviews here I was aprehensive but ordered anyway. I am waiting on new Macs to come out but needed something to fill the gap, replacing my old dying HP laptop hardware/heat related issues that may be  by Win 10). I could not resist the price at 179.99. If it doesnt work out, I can donate it to our Cub Scout pack, who needs a limited capability laptop.  You get what you pay for.\nAre there storage limitations? Yes - I can keep my files on a home Network Attached Storage (NAS) drive for a while. (I must figure out another backup solution for files. We have several other home computers I might use or i may try out the bundled cloud storage that came with it for a limited time).  I have already researched and it looks like it will accept any size microSD card (greater than the 32GB cited in HP literature). I will also try that as a local storage or backup volume.\nAre there RAM memory and CPU speed limitations? Yes - cant do anything about this other than not run many apps/web pages at a time.  I have installed Firefox and opened at least 10 tabs on one of my favorite forums. It took many seconds (maybe 15) to load all the pages but once they loaded, there were no issues reading, scrolling, or switching between tabs. With task mgr running, CPU usage was at 100% for most of the load time but settled down after they loaded.\nDespite other reviews, the unit i got did not have much bloatware on it. I installed and ran CrapCleaner first and it only found a couple of items i removed immediately. I left most of the Windows 10 fluff on it thinking i might use it at some point or remove it after a few weeks if i haven't taken the time to learn to use it (I started using Win 10 just a couple of months ago and haven't taken the time to actually learn all the features).\nOther concerns: I should have gotten the 13 inch instead of the 11 due to eyesight vs screen area. But I didn't have time to wait on a deal. I increased the font size in Win10 to 125%. The keyboard takes a bit of getting used to becuase your hands are closer together and some keys (like delete and backspace) are not in the usual locations. I don't like the tocuhpad but stopped using it after installing the wireless mouse.  Some Win10 apps cannot be uninstalled (uninstall button is greyed out) using the Win10 normal function. This includes Xbox (I don't game); Windows store, and a few others i cant remember. Im sure there is a way to remove this stuff but when i looked it didn't take up much storage space.\nSo far i have installed: CCleaner (freeware version); Logitech wireless mouse; Firefox; Thunderbird. Except for speed on the last two, all perform adequately.  I played a youtube.com and played a video and also checked the HDMI port, driving my flatscreen TV. There were no issues. I plugged in an 8GB microSD card that we had around the house. It showed up immedately in Explorer but i haven't used it yet. I only have a few stored emails and NO stored files moved over so far. Using Explorer C drive properties, i have used 15GB of 28GB (only 13GB more availlable.) I have not elected to compress the C drive yet (not sure what the effect noticeable will be on speed, if any).\nI like the size and weight (small!) and the case seems comparitively rugged construction. Although i have had few problems ith HD's in the past, i like the SSD instead of an HD. I have already dropped it once with no issues."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "We bought this laptop on 11/29/14 and have used it daily for the past 14 months for websurfing, email, watching videos online.  Out of the box, it had Win 8.1 installed & everything worked great. Wifi connected fine, comfortable keyboard, nice design; the best part is still the looks & color (which is sad, actually).\n\nWithin a few months, the Wifi started dropping a lot. We bought a USB wifi adapter and that helped, but the onboard Wifi really should be good enough quality to last.  The keyboard is a pain. It's just not as smooth as other ones. Not sure if it just gets old, but I've never noticed keyboard issues with any of the numerous other laptops we've had.  The computer is sluggish.  We run Avast, Malwarebytes, and Superantispyware regularly and disk cleanup, but it's just too slow.\n\nThe biggest issue is lack of storage space! This hard drive is just TOO small for a large operating system like Windows!  (fine with linux)  These streaming laptops should come with a minimum of 64gb hard drive space.  We don't use this to store files such as photos, videos etc. Just Windows, antivirus, and a few programs we use regularly.  We can't even load Office because there isn't enough space (after cleaning the disk via Windows and Clean Master). If you do a Google search, some people can't even update Windows or upgrade to Windows 10 because of the lack of space.\n\nWe are getting a micro SD card (it does have a micro SD slot) to keep in the slot all the time so we can transfer as much off of the SSD as we can eg if we can use the micro SD for antivirus, Office etc that may help.\n\nNext time I buy a streaming laptop, I will look for a different brand (all our HPs have been problematic) and something with a bit more storage.\n\nEdit:  Office 365 can NOT be stored on an SD card. Unlike previous versions of Office, there is no option where to install.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I've gone through a few laptops over the last number of years, with mixed results and experiences. In the past I have had decent luck with HP, so when I needed something inexpensive quickly to keep up with school work I jumped at the chance to try this machine out. I have been disappointed. Really the only reason I would even give this thing two stars is that it was cheap and readily available. I guess you do get what you pay for.\nLess than ten days after receiving this thing it crashed during an update and completely locked out all controls. It had to be returned to HP to have the BIOS completely replaced. This took over two weeks. So much for being readily available. From what I have found out since then, this is a fairly common occurrence.\nThere are issues with working with the internet, where it randomly reloads pages without notice, which can be a problem if you are dealing with any type of online communications. I even spoke to HP about it, and their response was \"Yeah, we know about that. It happens all the time. It is on our list of complaints to take care of.\" A list of common complaints? Really? And they are producing these without a fix anyway? Did they not test out the system before release?\nBeyond that, for supposedly being a 2gig ram machine, it is incredibly slow. At start up it has at points taken over an hour to recognize a key stroke because the pre-loaded McAfee takes up 90% of processor capacity.\nEach update I have run, some while trying to delay it to a more convenient time and it ran anyway, has instead of fixing issues made more. I have more than once had to recreate all the hot buttons and shortcuts to applications because an update wipes them out.\nWhen I complained to HP about the speed issues and random wipes, again the said these were common complaints, and eventually updates should help clear up my complaints.\nOver all, I got this machine because needed something reliable for school work. I am a graduating senior with multiple classes with online components. This machine failed me, and continues to do so, and has done nothing but make a stressful time much worse. It may be alluring because of the price, and coming in fun colors, but if you need it for anything beside just being bored and occasionally attempting to waste time, it will waste your time and money. Be prepared for frustrations and quite possibly loosing the system back to HP."}

The updater will download all the updates and then begin installing in order of download.  I still like the idea of this laptop but not so much the actual laptop.\n\nAlmost sent this laptop back.  My other option was an ACER Cloudbook that was very similar to this one and a little cheaper.\n\nBut for the low cost, I decided to keep it.  It is really buggy and my first attempt to update the Windows 10 OS wasn't successful for some reason but I decided to work through the issues.  Just keep coming up with new bugs that I feel have to do with Windows 10.  For example, my trackpad settings wouldn't save upon shutdown.  Yes, it was a bug that a Windows 10 update should fix.  Then my Facebook login will not save despite checking the box to save password.  Still trying to figure that one out.  And then with two users accounts it will freeze up and not allow the other user to log in to the laptop.\n\nBut overall, these things can be worked out with patience and time.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "This is a tough review, but here goes... I really wanted to like this computer. I teach at a local community college and I'm always on the lookout for inexpensive laptops to recommend to my students. A $199 (now $179, evidently) Windows 10 notebook with 1 year of Office 365 included seemed like a \"too good to be true\" offer. Well, it was, kinda. I'm not going to review the features, that's been done very well here and on Youtube by others, very accurately. Fit and finish for a computer of this price is impressive. However, the 32GB main storage (C:\\ drive) is a deal-breaker. If you don't watch it closely, Windows will gobble up ALL this storage space for itself and you will find the thing unusable. I had to beat Windows down to a minimum and turn off all Windows updates to conserve this extremely limited (and un-expandable) storage space.  It DOES support an SD card as storage (shows up as D:\\), but you must put a fair bit of effort  to install software to the D drive, not the default C drive. Again, it is do-able, but this is a serious nuisance and you need to pay close attention to direct every software install to the D drive. Even if you use cloud storage (a must), the local storage situation is terrible.\n\nThe other situation I encountered was that the \"included\" one year subscription of Office 360 was NOT included. I ended up spending over four hours on the phone over a three day period with HP Support trying to straighten this situation out. No gory details here, but it was as bad as you think it would be. I did, eventually, convince HP to send me a license for Office 365 but I wouldn't set my students (or my worst enemy) up for this experience.\n\nBottom line - a good computer for the money - sturdy, good battery life, kinda pokey but OK performance. But that 32 gb limit is a killer - Windows 10 eats disk space for breakfast and there just isn't enough space for Windows 10 and you at the same time. You lose, sorry."}

Only flaw to useing it for school is well it isn't that fast so if you have a huge paper open with music and a power point or school website open, well you will probably get a bit of lag. Ive experience small bits of lag n glitches simply navigating the web and watching anime.\n\nBut over all:\n-Good battery life\n-runs cool no fans (silent pc)\n- fast for the price\n-very cost effective\n- appealing color / build\n- good for every day use\n- not for gaming\n- not for video editing\n- or photo if its in a high resolution"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I bought this at the spur of the moment because my previous laptop that was on its last leg bit the dust and I need a computer for a variety of reasons. I was a little nervous downsizing to a netbook computer, but I'm glad i made the choice. I am no longer a student and my laptop does not serve the same purpose as it used to. I also have a desktop, so most of my activities on my laptop were becoming Internet related.\n\nI am absolutely pleased at the design. For the price, it is extremely sturdy and does not feel like it's going to break. It is super lightweight. I can transport it just about anywhere. I recently went on vacation and I was able to carry my laptop with me on the airplane. In addition, it is super sleek and small. It can fit in my purse and that helps in transporting it.\n\nThe processing speed can be slow at times. Like most netbooks, it is not good for multitasking. If I'm video chatting with someone on Skype, I pretty much can't use thew Internet because it tends to go super slow and lag the conversation. However, it is much better than previous netbooks I've encountered and it's not the biggest deal.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have is the storage. I'm happy that cloud storage is becoming a thing, but as technologies become more advanced ,the  files keep on getting bigger and I found that the memory of netbooks hasn't been able to keep up with that. This one is no exception. However, it is not the biggest deal, seeing I can upload my photos and documents to Dropbox and One Drive.\n\nOverall, this is a great value and it exceeds my expectations for its price."}

Browsing pages takes FOREVER and streaming music? Forget it. Especially if you're trying to type using word or google docs. I didn't need anything fancy, I don't download on this computer because I knew that the storage was minimal, I clear everything off onto my external hard drive whenever I get the chance, but that doesn't even seem to help. I got rid of mcafee and a few other small things that weren't needed and it STILL RUNS SLOW. Overall, I'm disappointed with it's performance. And now that I've had it for 4 months, the battery, which used to last almost 8 hours, now barely lasts 4. I don't leave it plugged in, I charge, then remove and use, it doesn't get beat up or tossed around... there is no real reason for the battery to be dying already.

While the size and weight is perfect for travel (the reason I purchased it), this machine has caused endless problems in the few months I've owned it.  It's advertised as having a 32GB hard drive, which I assumed would be more than enough space, particularly since I store all of my files on Dropbox or on an SD card. Unfortunately, normal Windows updates and usage eats up the space so quickly that I'm down to under a GB of space left. Using an SD card to store files and apps does not solve this problem. The latest Windows update freed up about 6gb of space and I thought the problem was solved, but now the space is gone again. I've tried all of the troubleshooting tips I could find (Disk Cleanup, etc) and nothing worked. I'm now trying to reinstall Windows, as a last effort to make this computer usable, but right now I don't have enough space for the new install.  I've spent hours researching how to make this computer work. If I could return it, I would."}

It is very portable and light. It will also hook up wireless to a mobile hot spot if needed. The purple color is a bit darker in reality, compared to the picture. Still very purple and very easy on the eyes. I did however take a few apps and extra \"garbage\" off of the system when I got it. If you are purchasing this notebook in order to play games, you will not be impressed! There is not a lot of storage on this notebook. Although there is a slot for an SD card and an external zip drive can be used for storage. My advice is to check the specifications of the system and compare them with what you are intending to use it for. Purchase responsibly!!!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I received the computer, opened the box, and plugged it in and turned it on. The screen turned on, and the desktop appeared, but nothing else would happen -- no cursor, no ability to open programs, nothing. The on/off button would not work. Unplugging and plugging back in did nothing. The next day at work, I contact HP customer service, who were nothing but a waste of time. They offered no help, other than telling me to take the computer in for repairs. They didn't seem to understand that I had just paid for a NEW computer, not for a computer that had already broken and been repaired. I exchanged the computer through Amazon.\n\nThe new one arrived, and I opened the box, plugged it in, and turned it on. This time it worked, although it was already so slow that I was shocked. Trying to check my email took five times as long as it does on my old computer. And this was literally the first time I'd used the thing. In fact, the whole point of this computer seems to be that it's a trojan horse to get people to use a bunch of HP's favored apps -- they're built into the computer, taking up precious space, even though they're mostly useless and stupid. After I finally checked my email, I plugged my camera into the computer to download some pictures onto a popular photo-sharing website -- not downloading them onto the computer itself, mind you, but onto a website. What happened next? You guessed it, the computer crashed and would not work again no matter what I did. So all told, two brand-new computers worked for a grand total of 5 minutes before they both died.\n\nI contacted HP customer service again, and got the same response -- send it in for repairs. I asked the HP person if this computer is just a scam. He didn't deny the notion, but he also didn't take my problems seriously or offer any real assistance, even when I told him that he was about to lose a customer forever. I returned it to Amazon and will never again buy anything for this shady company."}

It is extremely slow and can take minutes to open up a program and webpage. Opening up multiple tabs is a nightmare because it can take over 5 minutes to get all of the tabs loaded. Watching any videos (youtube) takes a long time to load and there are usually problems where the sound is ahead of the video or the video is extremely laggy and it's not an internet problem, either, because I have no issues with the 2 other computers in the house. I have nothing extra installed on this laptop yet over half of my storage is full. Overall, I'm really disappointed with this purchase. I figured this laptop would at least be able to handle mild internet and microsoft office usage but it really comes up short.\nUpdate 3/29/16: due to a hardware failure this laptop no longer works at all. It lasted less than one month (arrived March 3rd). What a piece of junk."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "This laptop went from being something I nearly returned to a decent Windows 10 machine after I spent a fair amount of time sorting through device manager and updating all of the drivers.\n\nI bought this computer for my elementary school aged daughter as her first laptop and we became quickly frustrated over how slowly it ran. CPU would spike to 100% upon boot up and generally stay there, occasionally drifting down to the 40-60% range before spiking to 100% again, with no applications actively running.\n\nI bought the laptop with Windows 10 option installed and considered that maybe the hardware is too underpowered for the OS. After doing some investigation to troubleshoot the slow wireless connection, I saw advice on an HP support forum regarding the Windows 8.1 to 10 migration for this model to update the network adapter driver.\n\nAfter that worked, I systematically checked all of the other drivers and about 25% of them, including graphics card, keyboard, etc, needed an update.\n\nAfter the thorough driver updates, the laptop now runs much faster, CPU stays in the <20-30% range most of the time, and the applications behave as expected.\n\nFor a low cost laptop, the HP Stream runs acceptably if not exceptionally. Hopefully this advice about the drivers will help anyone encountering issues with running Windows 10 on this machine or give potential buyers something to consider when making a purchase (the driver updates are easy to do, they're just time consuming)."}

I know part of the point of Windows 10 is Microsoft streamlined the OS for mobile and close-to-mobile devices, but really, you're gonna have to put a Linux variant for netbooks on it - which would be fine, except that the wifi card is one of those that's pretty much incompatible with Linux (it works, but only when you're basically next to your router).\n\nMicrosoft is going to need to make a special Chromebook-type variant of Win10 if it wants to compete with Chromebooks. I don't think this is HP's fault - I bought this computer because I had a broken PC and I needed something fast and it did its job up to a point, but Win10 is just too heavy duty for this computer's hardware.

Although it works very well and has a solid state drive system, it is totally inadequate when it comes to drive space.  It only has 32 Gb and 21 of those are used up by the processing system. Until you load in a couple of extra programs and get the updates, you are down to 4 or 5 Gb free space.\nI made the mistake of loading windows 10 on it and now my drive is full and will not load the updates.\nI will have to do a clean out and reload windows 8 and start over again. What a pain.\nDo not buy this machine."}

So if you're a busy student like me who just needs to start getting work done ASAP it can be a little tiresome having to constantly click, \"yes, give this program access to the internet,\" all the time.\n\nAlso, sometimes you have to hit the space bar twice when you're typing something fast (like you know, a paper). So students, it's cheap but it's mildly annoying. Not annoying enough to spend the time returning, but it's annoying.\n\nHope that helps!"}

After days and hours trying to get it corrected, I finally deleted it and re-ordered Office 365 (at $7 a month). This took a day to download...all sorts of error messages kept popping up...It never dawned on me to tell amazon (now I think of it they probably would have replaced it with an English version), so I fought with HP and Microsoft. Now that everything's downloaded - at an extra cost to me, the machine itself is soooo slow working.  When I finally get to one site and try to go somewhere else, it comes up saying, \"hmmm, we can not reach this page...please try again.\" No matter where I try to go, that will pop up.\n This was definitetly a waste of my money. Not what it was advertised to be at all. Even my 9 year old grandson says it is not any good. (Not his exact words)and he knows a heck of a lot more about computers than I do.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I got this for school. I figured I wouldn't need that much power or memory since I just planned on using it for internet browsing and microsoft office. Unfortunately, this notebook can't do even that without being annoying. It's slow and I hate it because it makes me feel less efficient. Also, it just has about 10 gigs of memory for you to store your stuff. 32 gigs? Nope. It gets used up by the system and apps. This feels more like an inefficient, cheap tablet than a notebook and I regret spending my money on it. It's pretty, but utterly worthless, at least for me. I recommend spending fifty bucks more and buying a better model. It's what I would have done had HP's stupid website accepted my debit card."}

First off, this is a cute little computer, and my daughter likes the aesthetics.  The screen is decent, it's not 1080p HD like we are used to these days, but it still has a good picture, it could be brighter though.  The CPU is not fast, but it's not slow either, considering the price paid for this laptop, internet pages load quickly, word processing is smooth, video from Netflix has no skips or hiccups.  I can't attest to any programs that use a lot of memory or processing power, but my guess is this would not do well.  For a basic laptop this is a good choice."}

So not very powerful, and certainly not possible to install any other OS on here.\n\nOn top of that, it's been a while since I've used a non-Linux operating system extensively, and my experience with this windows computer does not make me want to start again. I PAID for this computer; that means that I should be able to do WHATEVER I want with it; if I don't want to upgrade to Windows 10, I shouldn't have to be harassed by pop-ups over and over again. If I don't feel like I need anti-virus protection because I'm adequately safe in my use of the internet, I should be allowed to do that. But there was never an option to disable either of these ridiculously annoying pop-up notifications.\n\nAnd here's the worst part: Finally, after 36 days of going unprotected, the computer told me I need to install anti-virus, without giving me the option to delay any longer. So I accepted Windows Defender, and then it asked me whether I want to give the program permission to install. So I said no. And the computer shut down, and cannot be turned back on anymore at all.\n\nWindows sucks. It's really sad that we live in a world where paying LESS for my software gives me more freedom to do with it what I want to do with it."}

Connects to WiFi good, keys are great for typing papers for school and good for watching Netflix (which are the only 3 things I really do) occasionally the sound while watching Netflix will go a little screwy but it always fixes with a pause so it doesn't bother me.

I like Windows 10, but it is rather large.  It doesn't slow the machine though.  All in all I was really pleasantly surprised by this little laptop.

Thumbs up!\n\n*Update*\nSo, about 2 months ago this thing completely died; we couldn't turn it on no matter what we tried. Although we bought the warranty, my husband wanted to make a claim through HP. Long story short: we had it shipped to HP so that they could fix it. Only once we got it back did it turn back on and start working again. I have no idea what happened, and neither do they. It works fine now, but we had to have it shipped to be fixed! I don't know what to think of this thing now."}

It replaced a laptop that was approximately 4 years old, and the improvement in function was obvious.  She uses it mostly for web surfing, email, and spreadsheets, so she doesn't demand a lot in terms of computing speed, but it handles her daily use perfectly.  The screen and keyboard size are excellent - we've had a number of smaller laptops and netbooks before that were just too small to efficiently type on, but that's not a problem here.

I came across this one and the majority of reviews were good so I decided to try it.  It's okay but it comes loaded with so much junk taking up what little memory it has so to get it to be responsive I'm going to have to go through and remove quite a few programs.  It's very slow to respond which is driving me crazy.  I would say you get what you pay for and if all you need is a small. lightweight laptop for a child or a preteen or to take on a plane or on a car trip then this would be a good choice.  If you want a laptop for more than surfing the web and doing some emails then spend a little more and get something more suitable."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I tried 3 other laptops the same week I bought this one! The Acer Switch 10 lost sound and WiFi all the time and had no bluetooth. The ASUS Transformer T100HA froze or restarted every 5 minutes. The Acer Cloudbook 11 was okay but the touchpad was super broken. Oh, and none of those let me reverse the scrolling--a minor detail which drove me nuts.\n\nThe HP Stream has just worked out of the box. Thank goodness. I came from using a Chromebook for several years so I expected all of my laptops to just work, the way Chromebooks do. The HP is the only one that lived up to that expectation. It's nothing fancy, and it can be a little slow loading tabs in Chrome (even when sitting right next to the router), but for the price I can live with that. It actually gets phenomenal WiFi reception, to where I can use the home WiFi in my bedroom (which I've never been able to do with any laptop since I've lived here). I deleted some bloatware and added a 64 GB microSD card, and it's good to go. I needed to switch from the Chromebook in order to use iTunes for my new iPhone and Microsoft Office for work (I couldn't use the online version for the features I needed). So far, it's working perfectly. I'm relieved to finally have found a laptop that actually works."}

On top of being slow, this thing also perpetually crashes. I believe the crashes are due to a lack of hard drive space.  running disk cleanup does not free up enough space to be of any help.....  32 GB is just NOT enough to run Windows 10.

I had this computer for less than three months before the headphone jack became loose with regular use. I would only at times be able to hear the music in one ear.  This has never happened on any computer I've owned. I ended up sending the computer in for repair, thinking it would be no problem.  But they told me the heapdhone jack is soldered to the motherboard and that it had snapped off.  They said this was not a manufacturing defect and therefore was not covered under warranty, so it would cost $320 to replace the motherboard.  This is obviously way more than the cost of the computer.  I am now out $220 for a computer, plus $16 for shipping to the repair center,  all for a computer I was able to use at maximum working order for less than three months.  On top of it, the customer service rep was extremely curt and indifferent and essentially cut me off and hung up on me. I have had three HP's in my life but I will never buy from HP again.  This is clearly a company in decline. They are selling cut-rate products and don't care about the customer.  Don't be enticed by the price. In this case, you get less than what you pay for."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I was looking for a small and lightweight laptop, which my 10 y.o. niece could easily use for her computer needs. After reviewing a multitude of choices on Amazon, I decided to buy HP Stream 11.6-inch (Intel Celeron, 2 GB RAM, 32 GB SSD, Violet Purple) laptop. Since it was a Christmas gift for her, I did not have a chance to verify it was working. So, the first chance I got to open this laptop was after a New Year, since after Christmas, my niece took the gift home to play with it. Since she could not set it up herself, she brought it back to me. I took it out the box and checked if all the parts were present, properly packed and looked new. Then I opened the laptop and noticed a small piece of paper packing tape attached under the right side of the keyboard with some writing on (see the photo). It had serial number and some other number written by hand, which at that time should indicate a red flag for me. I proceeded with setting up the Microsoft Outlook account for a kid and adult (for supervision). Then, I activated the Microsoft Word subscription and installed the app. When I was done installing, everything seemed to work fine at first. The laptop was charging, the Microsoft Word seemed to function properly, and the only thing which I didn't like was the speed of the internet download, it was way too slow...I checked the internet connection and connected the laptop to my existing network. It was still slow, but I thought it is ok for 10 y.o. as a first laptop. So, I closed the laptop to make sure that the password I set up for my niece works. When I opened the laptop, the screen was dark and nothing was coming up. I tried several times closing and reopening it with the charger connected and without. I thought that  it was a glitchy charger, which I could easily replace. To test my theory, I used the charger from my own laptop, HP Notebook 15 (both laptops utilize 65W adapters). I waited for 15 min. to charge it for a bit, but it didn't work. I closed the laptop and left it closed for a day. The next day, I opened it again and to my surprise, it came alive...all the apps were working, Internet browsing was ok, so again, I thought that it was just a glitch, nothing serious. So, I brought this laptop back to my niece's house to let her get familiar with it and also to teach her how to properly use the Internet (how to utilize search criteria and proper syntax). The laptop was working well for a few hours, my niece was mainly using it for shopkins search. When she was done, she just closed it ( closed the lid). It stayed closed for a while, until I reopened it to search for something. When I reopened it, the screen was dark again and nothing was coming up. The power button was lit up, but the processor was quiet, as if there were no processes running on it. I was so frustrated with it, that I packed it back to its box and brought it home to ask my husband to look into it. He suggested to try a different charger again, and we made sure that when we inserted the charger, the white light on the right side of a laptop was on. So, we left it to charge for a whole day. The next day, when we reopened it again, no processes were running up, it was dead! We tried to reboot it with and without the charger (first, we used its own, then from my HP laptop) but it was still dead. The power button would light up when pressed on, but no processes were running and it remained dead quiet. It is still dead quiet now, as I am writing my review (wanted to make sure).\nI am VERY dissatisfied with this product, as I am not sure if the seller sent me a refurbished laptop or just a bad one. Having found the piece of paper tape with the serial number and some other number written by hand, gives me real doubts regarding the quality and the state of the product. At this point I really wish I had purchased this laptop from reputable store and got a warranty on it. But most of all, I feel guilty and resentful that my gift to my niece, who was so thrilled to get it, was a total bust. Since it has been more than 30 days since the purchase, I can't return it or replace it. I spent $200 for nothing and really regret this purchase, since now I have to buy another laptop for my niece.\nLesson learned - will never buy any electronics from Amazon again!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "This is a well built laptop with a nice keyboard, and it comes with a full version of Windows on it. Overall, I recommend it for people who need basic computing, shopping, working online, social networks, etc. Given its price, I was almost ready to give it 5 stars, because it really is incredible that this machine can do what it does for just over $200. However, I think it's necessary to point out its shortcomings so that people know what they are getting and can compare this to a mid price machine.\n\nFirst, the screen is really quite poor. It seems a bit faded and dim, and if you're not looking at it straight on, it's very hard to see it (i.e. It has a narrow view range).\n\nSecond, the touchpad mouse is not very sensitive. This is more annoying because it is something that one uses constantly, so it's a constant reminder of the comprise you're making with this machine. It works, but just takes getting used to. Disclosure- I usually use Macs, which have some of the best trackpads out there, so perhaps my expectations are unreasonable- but again, I wanted to make sure to be honest here.\n\nFinally, it is quite slow, especially before you take off some of the crapeware that comes pre-installed. Other reviews have very good directions for which programs to remove. Remove them, it will run better.\n\nI was going to list the tiny 32 GB solid state hard drive as a negative, but really, that is pretty minor these days. If you need more storage, SD cards are easy to get and affordable, and if you have more storage needs for photos or videos, this is not the machine for you (or, of course, simply use an external hard drive)."}

As someone who types 70-80 WPM, I find it difficult to use when the key strikes fail to recognize usage of the same letter (for example, when typing words such as 'better' and 'transmitter'). In addition, the space bar registers half of the time. In a college classroom environment, I waste precious note-taking time by constantly having to fix minor errors due to poor key striking."}

I am sure it will improve as soon as we can figure out how to get rid of Windows 10 and install Linux. Unfortunately, Windows 10 seems to have built in safeguards to make it much more difficult for users to get rid of the OS. Windows 10 will not let my son save anything on his flash drive and only allows the hard drive or the cloud as an option. We were disappointed that it seems more like a tablet with a keyboard and less like a computer- when what he really needed was a portable computer (for word processing and homework). I was sorely disappointed when shopping that it was so difficult to find a laptop that was NOT cloud based. I only settled for this because it was within my price range and was purple (his favorite color)."}

And if you're looking for a prop for a play or video or something and you have two hundred dollars to spend on that kind of thing, then by all means.  This would make a wonderful prop.\n\nOr if perhaps you need a paperweight.\n\nOther than that, DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP. NOT WITH WINDOWS 10.  It says 32 GB hard drive.  And I TOTALLY understand the concept of a cloud device.  But, when you can't even install Office 365 (which is approximately 3GB, mind you), after Windows 10 installs and all the updates occur, then, what exactly is the point of this?  (I installed NOTHING, all I did was turn on the thing and sign into my Microsoft account) It's WORSE than a tablet, because the OS uses up almost 100% of the CPU, so the internet is ALWAYS slow, no matter the connection.\n\nIt comes with a year of Office 365. Which you can't install because the OS takes up all the HD space.  So, yay?  Thanks for teasing with the prospect of a working device that you could actually USE Office 365 on.\n\nAnd don't be fooled by that 14 GB of free space after you set everything up.  It will disappear as updates are installed.  You can watch it happen, if you're a masochist or something.  It will dwindle and dwindle as if by magic, until only 2.85 GB are remaining. Disc cleanup doesn't work at all, because there is JUST Windows 10 on this device.  Nothing to fall back on.\n\nI do however, have some alternate name ideas for HP:  Hp Stream Craptop.  Maybe the HP Stream Nopebook?  Either of those.  Because this isn't a laptop.  It's just LIES."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "For this computer to work well, you need to remove all the junk that comes pre-installed, including their anti-virus ware--then install a low-footprint anti-virus of your own (free ones work great, but remember they're free so they'll have upgrade ads every time you start up, and those slow your computer down slightly). Make sure only your browser of choice is installed. Make sure you check all the start-up programs for anything that you don't absolutely need. There are YouTube videos that take you step by step through this whole process. At the end you'll have a laptop that starts up nearly as fast as a phone or ipad. Then carefully install ONLY the software you need! Make sure you're using the OneDrive for all your saving--dont' be putting stuff on the desktop or saving in weird locations without immediately deleting once you're finished with whatever it is.\n\nPersonally I would use a wireless mouse (amazon has a great one for super cheap) and not the touchpad...but it's nice to have the touchpad if you either forget the mouse or don't want to tote something extra. I would also recommend picking up a memory card if you want to install extra software--you want to try and minimize your footprint in the 32gigs of onboard storage where you can. But files (as opposed to applications) should generally be saved to your OneDrive\n\nNow you have a fast, lean, tiny laptop. From here you'll want to build your usage around online apps (like a chromebook) where possible. But the HUGE advantage over a chromebook is that you've got a fully functional Window 10 computer to run those Windows programs that you really want/need. Plus you get a year of Office 365 and a TB of storage on OneDrive for free.\n\nWho am I? I'm a professional visual effects artist. I work in 3ds Max and Maya 3D files that have billions of polygons and Photoshop documents that are hundreds of gigs in size. Do I use this for work? No, of course not--no laptop can replace a workstation for my work. Do I use it for writing in Word and spreadsheeting in Excel? ABSOLUTELY. Do I use it for its near instant-on start up and surfing the web. ABSOLUTELY. Playing movies and music? ABSOLUTELY. What is it like? Well, it's like a Chromebook but with more flexibility.\n\nMy wife has one that she uses for her work--her work requires her to use the Firefox browser to run proprietary software that runs through Firefox. If you have a Chromebook, you can ONLY use the chrome browser--you can't use IE and you can't use Firefox. That's a limitation that sometimes crops up where you least expect it. For instance, I've had studios (Disney (ILM) for instance) where the benefits portal does not support Chrome. If I had a Chromebook, I'd be locked out from those portals. Because of the nature of our use, we cannot limit our computer usability just to support google and chrome."}

The color is gorgeous and eye-catching, I love the gradient purple. More than one person has enviously commented on the color, and the 13.3 screen is perfect for me. I'm a writer, so I spend a lot of time staring intently at the screen. The 11 inch screens are usually too small for me, but 13.3\" is just right. The laptop is also surprisingly sturdy for something so lightweight and inexpensive. The last laptop I bought was an Asus (which cost 100 more dollars than my HP Steam) and the Asus seemed much less durable and more prone to pick up smudges. The fact that the HP Stream is smudge-resistant is important to me too.\n\nI had a Chromebook once, but found I couldn't use it (again, because I'm a writer) I couldn't handle being restricted to google docs, so I appreciated that the HP Stream was an affordable Windows laptop. Programs like OpenOffice and Office are a must for me. Because I use it mainly for word processing (and to surf for the occasional youtube video or check twitter) it suits my needs just fine. It's a little slower than some computers I've worked on, but since it's much less expensive than those computers, it feels like a steal. It certainly wouldn't be a good computer for gaming or anything like that, but it's perfect for me.\n\nIf I had one small complaint, it would be the keyboard. It seems a little cheap, and when I really get going, it sounds like it's squeaking a little bit. This is just a small thing though. The small 32 GB of storage can also fill up very quickly, but that would be easily solved by saving your stuff to a USB.\n\nAll in all, I was extremely satisfied with this little computer. I even considered buying another one in a different color."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "Great little laptop for all kinds of tasks. I've owned this laptop since January, 2015 and there has been little wear on the body, save for the touchpad. I've used Visual Studios, Photoshop and Java development on this laptop. Had to get a 16 GB SD card, but this laptop could use a lot more space. I'd say no less than 200 GB. Here are my thoughts on this laptop:\n\nPros:\n- Speedy processor; excellent Windows 10 companion laptop for a desktop\n- Upgrade-able SSD (IF you can find the WWAN module board)\n- Light enough to carry with one hand\n- Very durable plastic\n- Runs cold even with full utilization\n\nCons:\n- Screen quality is grainy and pixelated and is far too dark or bright\n- Ugly blue (will repaint this a different color)\n- Poor speaker quality\n- Touchpad is sometimes unpredictable. I recommend buying a mouse or swapping this one out from a compatible HP Chromebook\n- Side light is not necessary, would opt for a hard drive activity light instead\n- Non upgradeable RAM and processor\n- No DVD ROM drive\n\nOverall, I recommend getting a Chromebook unless you really must use Microsoft Windows. This blue color is a turn-off at a developer's conference or business meeting because it makes this look cheap. The screen looks bad at many angles because of it's matte design. HP can do better for a $200 laptop!"}

The keyboard is easy to use. Like that the mute button lights up when  pressed. Great price, especially if you are wanting it for writing, email, research and watching videos. I'm not sure about games, which I don't ever play. Also for writers, I'm not sure you would want a smaller screen than this 11.5. Great for the price. I noticed that you normally have to pay extra for tablets because keyboards and cases are usually sold separately. For the money and the convenience, this HP Stream can't be beat.\n\nUPDATE: Oh I sound so happy with the above statement, but now I realize that this is the worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon.\nThe more windows provides updates, the more useless this computer becomes in terms of memory and storage. I had to completely delete my I Tunes and my Microsoft Office 365 and every possible thing  I could and I still get messages that I'm running out of disk space. So what does that leave? I guess searching the Net and Email. Now with movies from Netflix and Amazon, the sound quality is horrible. You need earphones. The keyboard is hard to operate with its flat keys and of course no light. What a waste of money. No wonder it is so cheap. You can't even take advantage of the free Office 365 unless you completely delete it and install it on a better computer. Actually your smart phone probably does a better job of giving you research info and email possibility, so what is the point with this? I'm so sorry I bought it.\nPlease do not waste your money.

I'm generally a fan of HP products and bought my mother a full sized HP laptop that is working out great. Unfortunately, this one is just too damn slow.\n\nBoth my kids needed laptops for schoolwork. I wasn't sure if I wanted to go with a chromebook or stick to windows just for the sake of compatibility. The chromebook setup in minutes. This HP model took what felt like forever. Every step required several minutes of waiting. After it was done, it was slow as molasses. I figured it might still be configuring stuff in the background, so I just let it run for a bit.\n\nJust trying to bring up a simple web page in microsoft edge would peg the processor at 100%. I tried installing chrome, but that also took up full processor usage just to view cnn. I tried uninstalling every piece of non-essential software which helped a little, but the computer was still basically unsuable for browsing the internet.\n\nMeanwhile, the chromebook (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ASUS-Chromebook-13-Inch-HD-with-Gigabit-WiFi-16GB-Storage-4GB-RAM-Light-Blue/dp/B015ZD6ZH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ASUS Chromebook 13 Inch HD with Gigabit WiFi, 16GB Storage & 4GB RAM (Light Blue)</a>), seemed blazing fast. I really have no idea how anyone is actually using this HP computer. I was even tempted to install some flavor of linux to see if I could get some decent performance out of it, but I really didn't feel like I should have to do something so drastic just to get a single webpage to load in a timely fashion. Since the processor was maxed out, it felt like I was on dialup again.\n\nLooking at some of the other reviews on here, I'm not alone in experience this issue."}

Luckily, it takes an extra MicroSD card for storage and these are pretty inexpensive.\nOverall I am impressed by the speed of this little machine, battery life is great, the 13in screen is adequate and it definitely beats a tablet. Windows 10 came loaded with a lot of unnecessary crap being part of the Microsoft store and a few other unnecessary programs, luckily I was able to uninstall these with ccleaner, including the ones that won't uninstall from the Windows 10 menu.\n\nI installed Office 2010 on mine (not the Office365) and runs without a hitch.\n\nSkype works well, as does Netflix. It has Bluetooth so you can stream audio to your portable speakers, share data with your phones, etc.\n\nThe speakers are loud enough for what it is, even though they might be a bit bass light even for laptop, but they're better than what I expected.\nAlso, lets not forget to mention the lightness of this unit - due to the fact that it is basically a glorified tablet with keyboard you save on weight and get extended battery life, and almost the performance of a fully fledged laptop, at least for normal everyday use.\n\nI am very impressed and honestly, I regret owning a tablet as this seems to be much better suited to my needs and will probably get a lot more use.\n\nI am taking 1 star for limited space as I don't see how it would've been so expensive to do a 64GB drive instead."}

I have office 365 and use Google Drive, so I didn't need a lot of power, so I thought.\n\nBefore I rant, let me tell you what it does do well: my 7 year old daughter uses it to practice her typing online (web-based program), and to practice her simple math, also using a web based program. She stays logged in, pops it open, waits a few minutes for it to figure out where it is and then whammo, she's off and running.\n\nNow the rant.\n1. Changing signed in users generally results in the black screen of death. If you're patient the computer may find its way to an actual desktop but I  am generally done by about fifteen minutes and do a hard reboot.\n\n2. Syncing files for Google Drive is RIDICULOUSLY SLOW. One edit to one file (file size 3mg) took... I timed it.... 17 minutes. My favorite laptop, same wireless network, took less than 2. This has resulted in more than one file being corrupted when the computer gives up, goes to sleep, or I don't realize that it's not finished. When you're writing a novel a corrupted file is kind of an emergency.\n\nI expected to make some compromises at this price point, but I'm not exaggerating when I say that my phone has more processing power than this product.

He had the laptop for seven months and the earphone jack stopped working.  We shipped the computer back to HP and they said they'd fix the earphone jack for $350.  Of course, this seemed crazy to me considering the computer didn't cost $350 to begin with.  After trying to logically talk through why this did not make sense with HP customer support (actually seven different people) I had them ship the computer back to me.  When the computer was returned it had a big scratch on the exterior of the computer and it wouldn't even turn on.  We called HP back customer support again and they said, effectively, it was our problem.  I've decided that HP stands for \"horrible products\" and will not ever buy another HP product.  If you buy this computer just know it will not last long.  So if you want to spend $200 on a computer that may last a year then go for it.  One final note, we called Amazon and explained what happened.  Amazon graciously took back the computer and gave us a full credit.

The display was very dim, even at full brightness, and the colors were muted. It was slow and hard to navigate due to some skipping issues. My internet connection was not the issue; I was one room away from my router when I was using this computer, and all of the other devices in my house were connected and working just fine. I was looking for a cheap alternative to most laptops that I could use to casually browse the internet and take notes at school. It is definitely not worth even the low price it is."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "This computer would be great if it weren't for the extremely limited drive space. I can't say I'm a computer expert, so I wasn't aware how much trouble that was going to cause. It says 32GB but it comes out to a little over 28GB, for at least the one I got, and \"essential files\" take up over 16GB from that. I literally cannot store any files on this laptop drive, or there will be no space for it to run updates. I'm also very limited on app space and I keep having to delete apps I'd rather keep. I'm basically constantly running Disk Cleanup, with little resolution. I feel like part of the problem might be that there are too many unnecessary files in the app and \"essential\" folders, but I don't really know what I can and can't delete, so it's not doing me any good. I think it's a bit ridiculous that there are tiny removable drives and iPods with more space than this laptop.\n\nSo if you're a very casual user who can put everything on external drives, you'll probably be fine. But if you want to install additional programs to use (iTunes, etc.) and/or if you want to store some of your files on your actual laptop drive, it's going to cause you a headache."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I actually bought this from Walmart, not Amazon, but absolutely love this product nonetheless and decided to write a few tips here (including how to use it with a pen!)\n\nI honestly think the Stream does something unique. Does anyone here remember the iBook Clamshell from Apple and how unique and wonderful it was to hold one? Today, in an overflowing myriad of thin aluminum, this has disappeared. HP manages to bring up those memories with this model, offering it in two vibrant, striking colors and an all plastic design that's for everyone. It's light design and minimal ports remind me of a more reasonable price for the recent MacBook as well.\n\nYou don't get backlit keys or a re-invented keyboard. You don't get a premium display. You don't get one lone USB C port. You don't get that great of a camera, and you only get a simple diver-board style ClickPad.\n\nBut what you do get is an economy netbook that behaves like a bona-fide computer. The first thing to do (and all bias aside, I am *completely* serious about this!) is to get rid of Windows 8.1! You can strip out the apps, etc. you don't use, but both it and the recovery partition take up quite a bit of room on the tiny 32GB eMMC flash drive, leaving you crunched on here. But, I would *really* recommend to make a Recovery USB first, though, in case you need to reflash it, resell it, or are new to it all and change your mind. Spending a while configuring Gnu/Linux right to where I wanted it was well worth it. I had 75% of my disk free for use, and I really felt processor performance went up. Minus the additional 2 seconds for legacy mode, OS boot time was also pretty fast (10-15 seconds), but all this is also because of careful fine-tuning... and that it went right to a bare X.org with light programs.\n\nAs for hardware, this has a weak (but good) webcam for the price, a dual mic to match it, a fairly decent keyboard (do NOT pound the poor thing or it will break!) and Wifi and Bluetooth built right in. One USB 2 and one USB 3 port, along with HDMI, and 3.5 mm audio in are included, as well as a SD card slot on the right. The feel is very solid (in fact impressive, considering this computer's class), and the hinges are very responsive. The ClickPad works great, and I've had no problems with it when my fingers are clean and dry. Fine-tuning Touchpad settings is a definite need, however, so that it works the way you like.\n\nThis machine has a really awesome processor, related to the M family. In essence, though, it is simply a fan-less (seriously; I disassembled the notebook) Intel Celeron N2840 clocking at 2.16 GHz. Gratefully, Vt-x is supported for running virtual machines for anyone like me who needs to use that (even if it is just on the go), and both UEFI and legacy boot modes are supported.\n\nThis isn't for games, and was built simply for mediocre, everyday video streaming (hence Stream), writing documents, and Web browsing to compete with the Chromebooks. For me, I simply wanted something to replace my aging tablet PC to draw icons on and write software with on the go. So, why am I so excited? What makes this computer so cool, really?\n\n- USB 3! Seriously -- this cheap, entry-level machine has this built right in... and I was expecting just two USB 2 ports standard. Copies are inherently faster, and disk access from external drives is fairly snappy, even with the lagging eMMC storage this has in it, and I was generally (and genuinely) impressed.\n\n- Expansion. The SD card slot was a very, very wise decision, as 32 GB of extra space literally make the little storage this machine comes with humanly livable with a quick mount script and symlinks (or if you have Windows 7+, just set up Libraries to point your folders over). I might also mention that you could also dedicate extra swap space with a portable image to get more out of the 2 GB of RAM in here as well.\n\n- Efficiency. Out of curiosity, I compiled a full snapshot for a software project I work on (as of this writing) utilizing both cores, and put the computer on its side rather than in a normal bottom-down position to better dissipate heat. Despite not having a fan, it surprisingly did not overheat (Linux reported sensor temps at 75 C, which was warm, but definitely not 90 C hot) and went through the compilation just 50% slower than my mobile workstation with a much faster processor. Again, same as with the USB 3, I was impressed at this performance for this level of machine -- especially with a humble Celeron, which are famously slow.\n\n- Battery. This is seriously like carrying an iPad around with a lid (and yes, you can use it like a tablet. See the next point for that...) as it gets an incredible 6 hours of use! And I really like the thin tipped new generation adapter HP is including with the Stream, etc. as well. The battery is not user servicable, but it is not soldered (I took the bottom plate off), so like the Envy, on the day the battery finally goes out, it shouldn't be too much of a challenge if you're experienced to simply pop in a new one.\n\n- Matte screen (which also means \"Hello, pen!\"). To start with, there are no annoying reflections of the world on here! While the color depth is not the greatest and you get a standard 1280x800 resolution, it is uniform with a good LED backlight, and that also means something else -- something really important. If you buy a (good) optical pen from eBay or on here, etc. you can pair the pen to a dongle and tune the settings to your liking. From there, while you will not have a point-to-point interaction with it (the pointer will move independently of the pen's placement), you can draw, click, and move the pointer around the screen, saving you $100s from buying a convertible or other hardware if it works for you. I personally found doing this really cool. :-)\n\nOverall, I am seriously in love with this machine -- and I have not felt this for a really long time. I literally have been finding myself spending more time with it over my workstation, thanks to its awesome portability and the pen hack! Buy this little computer -- with the right expectations, you won't be sorry you did!"}

It came with Windows 10 - right out of the box, it installed 11 updates, after which I got the message that it failed to \"upgrade to Windows 10 Home, version 1511, 10586\" because it needed more space! I googled the error, and found the suggestion that the recovery partition be copied to a flash drive and then deleted from the hard drive, in order to free up the necessary space. Except that this can't be done on newer HP Streams like mine, because they have no separate, free-standing recovery partition any more. Also, though the computer comes with Windows Defender, there was no way for me to turn it on. I had uninstalled McAfee right off the bat, so there should be no conflict with another anti-virus program, but the option to turn on Defender remains grayed out, Also, I find the computer to be surprisingly slow for a brand new machine, and the microphone is defective (so I can't use Skype).\nI'm only planning to use this computer for email and general browsing, so I don't expect to need a lot of storage space - but I sure didn't expect the computer to not even have enough space for Windows updates! I will try a clean installation of Win 10 from a USB drive - I've read people have had some success with that - but I wouldn't recommend that for someone who's not comfortable \"messing around\" with a new computer.\nI love the looks of this machine, but I'm afraid the joy ends there."}

Unfortunately, I didn't do enough homework here, or rather, some drawbacks of this operating system were not clearly stated. First off, my laptop did not come with a passcode to access Microsoft Office Personal. After multiple chat sessions and an hour waiting to chat with an HP rep, I was told that a manager would have to contact me in the next 24-48 hours. They did and offered to send me Microsoft Office Home via mail. Then they called back and left a message stating they couldn't \"confirm\" that this offer had come with my purchase and I had to send them photos of my invoice and the stickers on the laptop and box. Ridiculous, but I did it anyway. A day later my passcode and disc (completely useless given that this device has no CD ROM drive) arrived, however, I was still unable to access office and needed to spend another hour and a half via phone with Microsoft to remove the installed software, reinstall it, and get everything running. Great? No. Though the Microsoft service was far preferable to HP, I've now discovered that I'm unable to attach files in Chrome, the e-mail and other services I prefer to use for my basic internet use. This is due to the fact that photos and info are stored via flash which isn't compatible, yadda, yadda, yadda, after several internet searches, I've discovered this and it sucks. Uploading photos, even with a separate card reader, was a nightmare with no ease of use and difficulty transferring them to other locations. I'm unable to return the product since it is apparently functioning just fine, but it is not at all what I'd expected and the memory is even worse than advertised. Crapware everywhere. I'm beyond disappointed and will, unfortunately be stuck with this device. Do yourselves a favor and spend an extra $100 to get something more multi-functional."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I bought this machine to replace an aging laptop my son uses at college.  Full disclosure:  I bought the machine at a local retailer instead of Amazon.  I wanted a quick way to return it if it wouldn't work.  My son is an Engineering student and prefers Linux to Windows, so compatibility with Ubuntu / Xubuntu was a key factor in the choice.  There is one MAJOR linux \"gotcha\" with this machine: wifi - more info further into the review.\n\nAs delivered using Windows 10, the machine seems OK at best.  32GB of storage and 2GB of memory are not really enough to make the Stream 11 useful for anything more than casual browsing and video streaming.  You won't want to play games or do anything compute intensive.  The included AV software is a particular drag on performance.  While I was trying to create the recovery drive, AV would suck up to 45% of available CPU.  I uninstalled it and finally created the recovery USB stick.  Next, I used HP's utility to update the BIOS and several other programs.  Once the machine BIOS was updated, I proceeded to install Xubuntu 15.10.\n\nThe machine booted from the install USB and everything worked, albeit with a very low wifi signal.  I selected \"something else\" during the setup and wiped only the Win10 partition.  I wanted to leave the recovery and diagnostics partitions so I could return the machine to its original state if it just didn't work out.  In the free partition, I created a 2G Swap partition and used the rest for Xubuntu.  I did not download updates during the installation, preferring to do this once the machine is running.\n\nOnce up, it booted immediately to the Xubuntu desktop but wifi was spotty.  I used a USB Ethernet dongle and hardwired connection to my network, then installed updates. After the update and restart, wifi stopped working completely!  Making a long story short, there is a driver related problem with the Realtek RTL8723be wifi in this machine.  The fix has two parts:\n- install an updated driver as documented here:  http://askubuntu.com/questions/590414/wifi-problems-with-rtl8723be-in-ubuntu-14-04  Note this will not cure the problem just get wifi working if you are sitting right next to an access point\n- Open the machine and move the single antenna to the other connector on the router.  Yes, you have to physically OPEN THE MACHINE.  HP, for whatever reasons, elected to only put one antenna wire in the case even though the wifi adapter supports two.  The Linux driver cannot currently detect the port with the best signal and simply uses one antenna - the wrong one.  It's not difficult to lift the keyboard and make the change, once you realize there are screws under the feet and two small rubber plugs.  A credit card allows lifting the keyboard without marring the plastic case.  The wifi adapter is at the back-right; the black wire has a teeny-tiny connector that snaps onto the adapter and can be easily moved to the other port.  Still, it's not a pretty fix.  If you are willing to make this change, you'll be rewarded with great wifi performance.  The linux driver maintainer is currently working with Realtek to find a software solution to the problem.  The other alternative, of course, would simply be to use a supported USB wifi adapter, but where's the challenge in that?\n\nThe last change I made was to edit /etc/fstab, move temp directories to a ramdisk and add \"noatime\" to the main partition, to save write wear and tear on the eMMC/SSD.\n\nEverything else \"just works\".  Booting is quicker than Win10 by a good margin.  Screen resolution is excellent. Touchpad works as expected.  Bluetooth support is great.  I paired an HP6000 bluetooth mouse; it works great and I was stunned to see that clicking the \"battery level\" icon showed the mouse battery level as well as the system!\n\nWere it not for the wifi issue, this would be a five-star machine.  At the price of a Chromebook, you get a truly great day-to-day Ubuntu machine with full program support."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "Two main problems. First, this laptop was advertised as having 32 GB memory. However, when you open up the stats, it says it only has 21.1 total, and after setting it up to run with bare minimum installations, it only has 11.1 GB left--apparently not enough to run Minecraft, which is why my GD wanted the laptop from \"Santa\" to begin with. Second, the laptop appears to be used.  It says that some things were updated on it in 2013 and again in 2014. Other than that, it actually works beautifully just for her playing Poptropica and a few games like that online.  I wish it could be fixed so that it would play Minecraft, but it looks like I'll have to return it. I only wish I knew what kind of bare bones laptop I could exchange it for that would \"get the job done\" or if there would be an easy way to increase the memory, but I am not tech savvy at all.  :-("}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "The whole point of this laptop is it runs windows over the Google OS for the same price. This device CANNOT operate windows 10. It sucks even when you extensively adjust every setting to make it work well, and are just doing extremely basic tasks like web browsing! They load it with a heavily bloated OS, and even after playing with it for hours It is still is maxing out the processor and lagging. This could be a great device...if it came with an extremely stripped down and efficient version of windows, but it doesn't.\nThat being said i switched to linux ubuntu like another review suggested, took the keyboard off and switched the antenna port on the wifi card, and installed rtl wifi new as the driver (just search around online you'll find it) you'll have to install using cmd prompt. now this thing is great. But...you could just go buy an older laptop that's better supported for linux and get the same result for 1/4 the price...at the same time it probably won't be as portable and have as good of battery life. Pretty much i don't see these things selling well, much like the windows phone they don't come with an OS that is compatible with an entry level device (or is barely compatable reguiring atleast 2 gigs of ram) while linux ubuntu only needs 512 mb of ram...So basically if your not a computer tech don't buy, but for me with the new OS this thing is great. If it came the way mine is setup now out of the box i'd give it 5 stars."}

Start up time is mediocre, and everything just doesn't seem to load as fast as it should be. And it doesn't have much memory so unless you have an external hard drive, to store things like photos and music, you might run into some problems.\nOverall, I wouldn't waste your money.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "This was a Christmas present this year for my daughter, primarily for web browsing, some apps and doing homework. After ONLY ONE WEEK, it stopped charging and when we shut it down (properly) the screen went black (as if it were off), yet the power light remained on - meaning, you can't power it on/off. We tried holding down the power button and nothing happens. We called HP support and they were hopeless (e.g. the rep asked me to take the battery out when the HP Stream doesn't even have a removable battery!). Our only hope now is to return it and get our money back. To state that we are extremely disappointed is a huge understatement.\n\n**UPDATE: We let the power completely run out and then charged the laptop. When we turned it back on, we realized it had just gone through an automatic update. After doing a lot of research, we learned that these little laptops can't handle ANY updates. My husband updated all the settings and removed the HP software that caused the problem (not sure exactly what he did though). Since then the computer has been working with no issues. I have upgraded my rating because we were able to keep and use the laptop as intended. However, there is a serious flaw when a PC can't handle its own updates so I can't give it more than 3 stars.**"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I got this laptop for Christmas and I love it! The color is a beautiful dark purple on the outside with the same dark purple to a lighter purple gradient on the inside. The color definitely isn't childish, which is what I've been seeing a lot. I'm a freshmen in high school and it does exactly what I want/need it to do. First of all, the battery life is amazing. I've had it last up to 7 hours on one charge. It can also do quite a bit at once. I don't know what people are complaining about. I watched Netflix while downloading a game and had no problems. Also, unlike what lots of people have said, it CAN play games. I've been able to run Sims 4 on low settings, the first Mass Effect, Skyrim (but it was a bit laggy), and a few other simple games. I've put all of these on an external hard drive. If you want to play games, just don't expect to play new big games on it. It can run things that are a bit older or aren't as demanding games, but don't expect to run Fallout 4 or something like that. Back to other things, It comes with a free year of windows 365, which is very useful because I'm in high school. It also comes with a month of McAfee protection stuff. The only bad thing I could say about this laptop is that sometimes the sound is a bit weird. It's happenend a few times where the sound was almost.. demonic? That's a good word to describe it. The sound slows down a lot or lags or something, but it's fixable by restarting the computer."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I purchased this based on some of the positive Amazon reviews, as a replacement for my Chromebook.  I expected a slight performance hit--after all, Windows 10 is heavier than ChromeOS--but the computer itself is almost unusable.  Using Microsoft Edge, any more than four tabs grinds the machine to a halt.  Even YouTube videos stutter in a small screen.  Don't even think about installing Chrome--this doesn't have the gas to run that browser.  Worse yet, if Window 10 decides it going to download some updates or perform \"maintenance\" while you're working, the entire machine grinds almost to a halt.\n\nThings get a bit better if you uninstall every bit of bloatware that HP \"helpfully\" installs for you.  Not much, however.  Basically, if you need to run Windows, spend an extra $100 or so and buy a more powerful computer. If you're looking to browse the web, buy a Chromebook. This box of half measures doesn't do much of anything well."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "Please, folks, do your homework before giving this laptop one star because it doesn't have an optical drive, doesn't have a ton of storage, etc. etc. This laptop is bare bones. I think it was actually engineered fairly well for what it is --- which is, a bare bones system designed for basic tasks like email, internet browsing, and using office applications (spreadsheets, word processing, etc.). It's not going to run games well (though it will run Minecraft fine on the lowest graphic settings), it probably won't play HD movies very smoothly, and with only two gigs of RAM you aren't going to be running many applications at once.\n\nTips if you get it - install the free version of Revo Uninstaller, and uninstall all of the bloatware that comes on any big-brand laptop. If the 32 gigs of storage space isn't enough, buy a SD card to keep in the laptop to store your media on, or buy an external SSD drive. Just remember to backup your data.\n\nSide note - can't stand all the one star reviews on here from people who don't know jack about computers and are whining because it \"Doesn't have a CD-ROM drive\" or \"Won't play the Sims\". Simple fact that even tech-challenged people can understand -- all computers are NOT created equally. But this is a good thing. It's like cars. You can buy a Ferrari, but you probably don't need one and can't afford one, even though they're superb. But that's okay. A Civic is still a decent car that will get you to point B. Just don't expect it to do zero to sixty in a few seconds. Same thing here. This laptop is sort of like the Civic. And I think it's a great little machine."}

However it's too slow to easily do online banking or online purchases. Want to log into your bank account online? The HP stream will eventually do it, but it takes so long that it's an exercise in frustration.  I unloaded all the junk ware to try to speed it up, but this didn't help. Also the track-pad is very bad, you'll likely have to use a separate mouse with it.\n\nThis is a cheap, but pretty much unusable computer, even for simple web surfing.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "Looking for a notebook that can keep up with your busy day? Then the HP Stream is NOT your best choice. In fact, this may be the first time I'm looking forward to the speed of UPS and USPS when it returns this laptop.\nMore than likely, you'll want it because of its looks, which I totally understand. I waited years for companies to start bringing color to the laptops, knowing full well that it would be more of a distraction to the purchaser who'd eventually notice the downgrading of the laptop. And make no mistake - HP is famous for their \"Pay no attention to what my right hand is doing\" while waving their left hand in front your face.\n\nI come from a family of HP engineers, back when Hewlett and Packard lived long enough to oversee their products built with the integrity they lost long before Carly Fiorina came on the scene. That's right - by the 1998, HP was well on the road to becoming what you see today - a company who's products appear all bright and shiny on the outside, but packed with tons of product placements that offers 30 days free for things you either already have or don't need, leaving you with spending more time removing, uninstalling, cleaning and reinstalling -sometimes three times! - just to completely clear out all the files that hide in the little nooks and crannies of the machine.\nAnd that's just the beginning:\n\nIf you are using this to keep you occupied while sitting in the doctor's office, just know that the RAM and Storage on this thing is pretty much spent the moment you turn it on with its Windows8 and/or Windows10 software. Think about it: On your regular 15in laptop, how much space does Windows take up? Now add Microsoft Office (I'm a 2010 Office person, so you won't ever see me trying to work with 365 -ever), Mcaffee (because you already know what a hog Norton is) and just for the heck of it, load something you know requires a minimum amount of  space and speed (That's not even possible anymore).  Okay? Great.\nNow go about your day. By the time you begin moving about the internet, collecting cookies, filling out your name, email address so Microsoft and the others can have even more access to your business, you'll find yourself cursing the machine, as you finger punch your keyboard trying to coax it to comply with what the advertisers promised in the beginning. And for gods sake, don't try and read your email!!!\n\nTrust me, by this time, you are no longer focusing on the pretty colors. You're too busy beating your head on the table for buying a 232.00 mini laptop, that runs 10 times slower than your kid's Dell 15in laptop, with 4GB RAM, 230GB storage, which only costs 70.00 more (At Micro-Center). I don't know if Fisher-Price is making computers for the \"little ones,\" but I wouldn't be surprised to hear stories of parents, tucking their kids into bed earlier, just to use their computer, which would no doubt be faster.\n\nOh yeah, and here's the kicker:\nNo CD/ROM and no way to open it up to modify. I take that back. You could open it up, but what a waste of time for the amount of money you pay. If it had a CD/ROM, you could justify buying it to watch movies, but do we already have that in another system? Then what is HP trying to accomplish here? Heaven forbid, HP should stop thinking their bottom line, and focus on products that would bring back faithful Return Customers, right?\nBut that's HP for you - Always looking to the \"turnover\" customers, because that's where their real profits lie - in the buying habits of those who have yet to discover the true uselessness of HP in the 21st century. Oh, by the way, have you noticed that many HP mouse have been USB- modified to fit only THEIR computers? A little more than  simply selfish, don't you think? Standardization is no longer key to their bottom line.\n\nLook, I've loved HP for years, and you can still pretty much get a pretty good HP laptop today (I bought an HP 17in last year, but I had to return two before that in order to get one worth the price), but you have to do your homework, and resign yourself to a period of modification, as with all laptops today. It's just unfortunate that HP who could have maintained it's position as a forerunner to providing quality products for the consumer,  chose to go the route of shortcuts and trying to sell expensive warranties that they hate having to honor.\n\nFinally, and this is not a political statement for or against Carly Fiorina, but I'll say it again: Don't fall for the hype that she was responsible for the way HP turned out. HP was going downhill fast and Carly got paid good money to wear that truth around her neck.\n\nSo, I'm going a MINUS 1 star, for the HP \"MUDDIED\" STREAM 13.3 LAPTOP. I think they should put the image of a bottle of MOLASSES alongside the HP LOGO. On second thought, never mind. They'd probably find a 30-day trial for an app that'll fill your laptop with imaginary molasses, and then include a discount coupon to purchase paper towels that will clean the mess it'll make as it turns your laptop to a brick. I am so returning this as soon as the next business day, which is faster than ANYTHING having to do with this piece of..."}

The solid click and double tap don't work as well as some reviews claim, response is slow, but it can also be oddly sensitive.  When typing if my hand brushes it it will respond when I don't need it to, but when I'm actively trying to use it the darn thing doesn't work so well. 2) The screen is also terrible.  Whites appear too bright even when you mess with the color schemes and it can be distracting, plus it has tight viewing angles. 3) The keyboard takes some getting used to.  It's justified to the left so my fingers will hit wrong keys all the time.\n\nThat being said, having Win 10 vs. a Chromebook makes this computer more flexible.

I had to delete several programs so that it could be fully up to date and run smoothly as HP puts many things on the system that runs in the background which saps the majority of CPU and RAM.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "Really happy with this laptop;  typing on it now in fact.  Fantastic value for such a low price.  First of all I live in reality.  I have to laugh when I read some of these reviews;  I mean come on, this is a sub $200 laptop, not a Cray or Watson computer.  Didn't you even read the specs?  I have a powerful 4 core desktop as my main computer and just wanted something super portable while on the road so I will not have to strain while trying to read my smartphone screen, or struggle with the tiny on-screen keyboard keys.  I also wanted all the Windows programs I like with me that I normally use.\n\nPROS:\n\n1) Sharp easy to read bright screen.\n\n2) Much faster than I expected given the low specs.  It is really just the load time of very large programs that I give it a ding for.\n\n3) Very portable and lightweight.  Would have gone with the 13 if that was not my criteria.\n\n4) It is so cheap that if it breaks or somebody steals it I will not go ballistic.\n\n5) EDIT ON 01-24-2018.  Replaced Windows with Linux mint 18.3 because there was not enough space on the laptop to perform any more Windows updates.\n\n6) This will be perfect for communicating with my Raspberry Pi fireworks launcher via wifi in the field:\n\n[...]\n\nCONS:\n\n1)  Yes it only has a small amount of drive space. That said, I knew that before I ordered it and added a 32GB SDHC card to my order.  I installed a ton of programs on the SD Card which still leaves me with 8 GB on the main drive.\n\n2) EDIT: SOLVED ON 01-28-2016. Wireless reception is really poor under Linux.  FIX IS LOCATED HERE:\n\n[...]\n\nEDIT AGAIN ON 01-24-2018.  Linux Mint 18.3 with the latest kernel includes the Realtek driver option to select the antenna port to fix the poor wifi signal (CAUTION: This is for the 11-r010nr model with the Realtek rtl8723be wireless chipset only.  I see other HP Streams may or may not have the same wifi hardware so you would need to investigate)  The external Realtek drivers from lwfinger are no longer necessary.  So, to fix the wireless run:\n\na) sudo modprobe -r rtl8723be\nb) sudo modprobe -v rtl8723be ant_sel=2\n\nc) Create a new file.\n\n  vi /etc/modprobe.d/50-rtl8723be.conf\n\n Add the following to the file\n\n  options rtl8723be ant_sel=2 ips=0\n\nd) reboot.  The wifi signal should double or more.\n\n3) I wish it had just one more USB port.  I often have to find workarounds because I need to connect another device to that missing third port.\n\n4)  EDIT: SOLVED THIS PROBLEM ON 12-27-2015 (SEE BELOW): Only a couple of Linux versions will load from a bootable usb memory stick.  I especially wanted to run Clonezilla so I could make image backups, but it just will not start up.\n\nThe following versions of Live Linux distributions do load fine though:\nLubuntu 15.10\nMint 17.3\n\nStill working on that problem.\n\nPROBLEM SOLVED:\n\nSo, this was really bothering me, so I played around with it this morning a bit. It was recommended by the Clonezilla author that I try Tuxboot and/or another USB drive brand. So first I tried Tuxboot with Clonezilla 2.4.2-61 Stable and initially it didn't work like all my other attempts. However this time I noticed a new boot option in the boot menu:\n\nWhereas the only boot option before was:\n\nUSB Hard Drive - Sandisk Extreme......\n\nA new entry appeared when using Tuxboot, and with Clonezilla being the only ISO on the USB drive:\n\nUSB Hard Drive (EUFI) - Sandisk Extreme\n\nSo, I gave it a try and a slightly different Clonezilla main menu popped up. It was a plain text menu of the normal selection of choices (resolution, etc) rather than the normal scrollable menu. Also, on top of the screen was the following text....\"GNU grub version 2.02 Beta 2-28\". I selected one of the entries (1024 resolution in my case) and Clonezilla started up properly. Unfortunately no such option exists when running YUMI, so I would have to put each individual distro on its own USB stick, which of course I would never do.\n\nACCESSORIES I BOUGHT (AND CAN VERIFY THAT THEY WORK PROPERLY):\n\n1) This is so I can hook directly to my wired LAN while at home.  I must say that WIFI is very speedy though and I have not had any glitches, so this was probably not necessary:\nCable Matters SuperSpeed USB 3.0 to RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet Network Adapter in Black\n\n2) An SD card with decent random write / read speeds.  I installed all my Windows programs on this card (The D: drive in Windows), so it would not fill up the main drive (Which in fact it would have!).\nSanDisk Extreme 32GB microSDHC UHS-1 Card with Adapter (SDSQXNE-032G-GN6MA)\n\n3) A Gigabit capable Ethernet cable to go along with the Network Adapter above.

The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because it's so thin and light compared to my MacBook Pro. However, the display was just too disappointing to overlook. The keyboard is also white and cheap looking. This is a laptop more suited for a child or a 13 year old's first laptop--not for a college student who is depending on the technology to complete assignments. I guess the saying holds true...\"you get what you pay for\". Back it went!!"}

The same with trying to install something simple like Google Chrome, it can never completes the install, after waiting for over 30 minutes - you must re-start,  to recover.

As a Chromebook owner, I understand the product's built in space limitations in terms of hard drive. You are paying for a machine to use with online apps primarily. As such, this is a good option - the size is light and portable while still being full scale enough to use effectively for heavy writing. The touch of the keyboard is solid and the machine feels well made. You will either love or hate the blue color - I personally like it! My only concern with this product is the speed. I do most of my work on a macbook pro, so I'm used to lightning fast responsiveness. The HP felt sluggish at times when using Internet based apps. I'm not techy enough to know if this is due to processing speed, but I definitely noticed the lag. Aside from that limitation, the computer would make a terrific model for a student or even an adult who is primarily using their computer for browsing and wants a fully functional keyboard and the option to use Office online (which comes included!). Recommended as a good value online computer."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I bought the HP Stream 13 to replace an aging Asus laptop that was starting to struggle...for one reason or another.  The Asus was a larger laptop that I had originally purchased to play Diablo 3 with my wife, however, we never really played.  As such, I've had this hulking monstrosity of a laptop for the last 3 years that was being used to browse the internet, check e-mail, and word process.  Basically, I could've used something much smaller, lighter, and more compact and still gotten the same performance.\n\nI read a bunch of the reviews on the Stream and liked what I was reading.  I knew going in that I was going to be working with a machine that was probably not quite as fast as the laptop I was replacing...but the thing is, that laptop was running so poorly after the upgrade to Windows 10 that even if this Stream 13 IS slower, it probably wouldn't really be noticeable.\n\nThe machine arrived quickly, as is the case for all of my Amazon Prime shipments...well, most of them...lately it hasn't been the case, but that's not got anything to do with the Stream.\n\nIt was packaged well, in a nondescript box that was easy enough to open.  On the inside, the computer was supported with some nice foam and it was secured very well.\n\nI popped it out and took a look.  I really like the color of it.  My last couple of laptops have been gray and black...it's nice to have a machine that's got a splash of color on it!!  I liked the feel of it, too...it's feel really kind of belies the price, in my opinion.  It looks and feels like a more expensive machine, that's for sure.\n\nWhen opening it up, I also immediately took a liking to the keyboard.  I've got rather large hands, and on other small-ish laptops my hands often feel cramped, but this is not the case on the Stream 13.\n\nI purchased the Windows 10 version of the Stream.  My experience with Windows 10 on both my Asus laptop and my Asus desktop has not been very positive...but I believe this to be more the result of Asus not releasing updated drivers in a timely manner, so the laptop in particular struggles because it's video card isn't running correctly.  I figured, though, that the Stream...with Windows 10 preinstalled...would probably at the very least have all of it's hardware work.\n\nI fired up the Stream and went through all the basic setup stuff.  As soon as I could, I removed most of the bloatware from the computer.  I followed suggestions in other reviews here and on other sites and removed pretty much everything that I wasn't going to be using.  After getting those things removed, I immediately upgraded to the November 2015 update to Windows 10.  That was interesting, as it required about as much space as the laptop has available...but once it was installed, I was able to delete the Windows.old file and get my drive space back.\n\nWith the newest update to Windows on the machine, it runs very well.  I find it to be snappy for opening apps, browses the web relatively quickly, and is a joy to type on.  I find the Edge browser to every once in a while seem a bit slow, but I've also found that the Edge browser seems to load every image from a webpage before it will actually let you navigate the page, where other browers seem to load images as you scroll...the result, I believe, is that Edge is just as fast as the other browsers I'm using, it just seems a bit slower because it seems like it's catching for a second right after it gets to a page.\n\nThe MicroSD slot works great for adding storage space.  I'll be saving all of my photos, videos, and documents onto MicroSD cards and using them as almost like miniature hard drives...this will allow me to keep as much space on the Stream as I possibly can.\n\nI've found that the complaints about this machine that others have are accurate.  The track pad isn't the greatest, and sometimes it doesn't register clicks or gestures.  This, however, for me isn't a concern because I'm wireless mouse user and I very rarely use a trackpad.  Even on my older and much more expensive Asus I found the trackpad difficult to use.  The screen also washes out at angles pretty quickly, but I also don't move around a whole lot while using my laptop.  It's...generally...on my lap directly in front of me, so there's no real reason for me to need to see it from an angle.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with this purchase.  It has a couple of downsides, but for the price I don't think you can really expect much more.  It's a solid machine that runs well, is easy to use, and gives you a full version of Windows.\n\nI would recommend this computer to anyone looking for an inexpensive machine for basic computing such as web browsing, e-mail, organizing photos, or typing."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I purchased this laptop in July of 2015, looking for a laptop for coding, mainly with arduino and python, small projects like that, and school work.\nFor the price, it seemed like a no-brainer. It combined the low-cost, low-weight, disposability of a chromebook with the everyday functionality of a Windows laptop.\n\nPros:\n+ Price point - Can't be beat, it's in a class of its own.\n+ Weight - The lightest laptop I've ever owned. I could juggle these. (Note: Do not juggle HP Streams)\n+ Durability - The Stream's 32 GB SSD means that it can take a bump or two without an issue. The plastic body also resists dents quite well. It does show chips and scrapes, however.\n+ Ease of use - Obviously, with windows 10 installed the Stream is intuitive right out of the box. Another bonus is that it is incredibly easy to install Linux. Unlike Chromebooks, there is no real limit to the operating systems you can install.\n+ Build quality - This goes hand in hand with durability. Very little flex in the keyboard, and very minor in the screen (What did you expect? it's 3mm of plastic)\n+ Battery life - Man oh man, if my old Toshiba Satellite was a big rig, this thing's a Geo Metro. I'm unlucky if I get less than 2 days out of the Stream with the backlight turned down.\n\nCons:\n- Speed - Obviously the Intel Celeron is no speed demon. But that's not the main issue. I tend to have many tabs open when doing research and other common internet activities, and 2 GB of RAM CANNOT handle that. This thing freezes up at about 3 open tabs in Firefox.\n- Space - This laptop is advertised as a \"cloud computing\" machine, and i understand that. But with the HP bloatware installed, and Windows 10 (which is a large operating system, especially for this thing) You're left with about 5 GB for other programs. This is not enough for my needs, at least. I will say, however, that with a lightweight Linux distro installed, that is bumped up to about 20 GB. Better, but still not great. Again, depends what you use it for.\n\nSummary - The HP Stream does what is is advertised to do quite well, and it doesn't claim to be anything it's not.\nShould you buy one if you need to do intensive computing, or god forbid, gaming? No.\nShould you buy it if you need to type google docs papers, or streaming (haha, that's it's name) Netflix, or leaving it in a classroom and not worry about anyone stealing it? Yes. Yes you should."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "EDIT TO MY EDIT: The computer is fine. I had stopped it in the middle of an update when it \"died\". After turning it off and letting it do it's thing, the laptop os totallu fine today. Everything is intact. All my programs work. No issues. I did cancel the update it wanted to do and now it's back to A-OK. EDIT: The computer died after just 10 days. I have requested a new replacement which Amazon is supplying free of charge. THIS IS A NEW MODEL for HP so they don't know how to fix the kinks yet. Mine croaked during a system upgrade for no reason. I spent 2.5 hours on the phone with HP and got nowhere. My computer still won't turn off. Blank screen but the power button is still lit. I am hoping this was just a glitch with my computer and not the next one. My daughter has had her HP for awhile with no issues. Please note that I DID LOVE this little computer! It's perfect for my needs. I can get onto my remote access for work and watch Netflix. You do have to delete a lot of preprogrammed apps, but after that, you'll have plenty of space. This is a perfect emergency and portable computer. People think it's silly that I got the same computer as my 13 year old, but it does the trick. I don't use it for gaming. The free MS Office for a year is awesome too!"}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I hate this computer. All I wanted it for was to type papers on for my college classes, and it can BARELY do that. All I have done is updated to Windows 10 (which was included) and installed Microsoft Office, and POOF pretty much all the memory was gone. It's so agonizingly slow! It restarts out of nowhere, and I have lost 2 papers this way (1 was my fault as I hadn't saved it, but the 2nd was saved, however, it somehow disappeared when the computer randomly rebooted itself). To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. I'm a broke college student who thought I was getting a deal. I have uninstalled a bunch of cap like Netflix that came originally downloaded (who is going to watch Netflix on a tiny laptop) and there is still barely any memory. Admittedly, I know nothing about computers and I should have known that pink, cute, and cheap ultimately means worthless but -oh well. Going to have to threaten the inanimate machine into doing my will for the next three years, and then it really is going out the window!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "This is my initial review of the 11.6\" HP Stream in the Violet color that has the newest processor (not last year's discontinued Horizon blue, nor the Orchid Pink Streams, which have less powerful processors and can be had for less than $199 now. Those can be picked up for $179 at Walmart, and other retailers.). All in all, I'm very pleased with the newer edition of the HP stream 11 with its faster processor.  It would be the bomb for anyone wanting a sleek and snappy budget laptop that doesn't play memory intense games, or do heavy graphic editing, etc. It's extremely portable, attractive and well built, super quiet, zippy and a terrific deal with the included 1 year of  Office 365 Personal. Plus you get an extra copy to use on your phone or tablet, too. It also comes with 1 year of 1 terabyte of cloud storage.  Mine did NOT come with the $25 Windows gift card, that promotion ended and doesn't ship with the newest ones. But it's still an incredible deal for all that this beauty does!\nAdmittedly, I am a power iPad user, in fact I have 3 going all day usually. But writing books on iPads even when they are equipped with Bluetooth keyboards is tedious.  So I when I saw the HP Stream came with a full year of Office 365 I bought it for the software mainly, and to have a copy of the software for my iPad, too.  The ideal consumer of this product is someone who wants a great deal on an ultra portable laptop that is zippy in performance and who wants to use it for basics, like using Office, browsing the web, online shopping, checking email, watching videos, streaming content , and for storage of photos and documents. It is NOT ideal in the least for heavy graphic editing, or for people who want to play 2D and 3D games that take incredible amounts of RAM, or for someone looking for a touch screen or tablet.\nLike formortals, the top reviewer did,  I also removed some crapware (but keep in mind I have a newer model than he sent his nephew, so some of it was different.) That included:\nThe Wild Tangent game pack\nAvast Secure Line\nHP welcome and registration\nPriceline\nApple Bonjour\ncIsco LEAP and EAPFAST and PEAP\nmcafee Antivrus (so I could default to the included Windows Defender)\nI did not remove the HP support, nor the Card reader driver and I have over 11 gig left on the drive, actually almost 12 G and that's after installing the Pc Decrapifier, and CCleaner (both free downloads, just search) to remove the stuff I didn't want.  You can also uninstall preloaded apps through the Settings.  I did not change any internet explorer extensions, nor mess with the bios or registry. I will update this review if I make further changes. Anyone can remove crapware. Even me. It was easy, so don't let other reviewers put you off. CCleaner also offers a free defragmenter and that's what I used to defrag after I was done removing the bloat ware. The almost 12 G is also after adding the free CCleaner programs (all 4, including the defrag tool), and the free PCDecrapifier, and Chrome.  The HP Stream also comes with Cortana, HP's idea of a personal assistant...I will probably uninstall that as well.\nMost of my gaming and streaming is done on my iPad Airs, so I won't comment on that as I did not purchase this for anything other than writing my books, performing research online, storing photos with the free year 1 terabyte cloud storage, and for creating my YouTube channels, though I will probably still rely on the iPads for most of the YouTube stuff. I did install Chrome and Magic Actions for YouTube. But another comment on the MS Edge browser...I like the fact you can write on the web!  But I'm not a fan of the Bing search engine.\nIf you do like movies it has the VUDU app pre installed where you can instantly watch any movie you buy with the VUDU label. Or you can remove it, too. It also has Microsoft's own music app. Streaming from Hulu or Netfflix works fine, no glitches, but I'm already spoiled from streaming on my IPads, so I doubt if I will use that much. The Netflix app is preloaded, along with  other popular links like Amazon, Priceline, etc. I removed the ones that I know I don't  use.  I'm using a 64G micro SDXC card for additional storage, and you can attach an external hard drive if you wish.  It meets my storage needs, and I write long books, with no problem storing the manuscripts.\nThis tablet performs better than my  $800 Dell laptop Inspiron 15..6 , though the screen is not as good in resolution.  However, I spend a lot of my day  on writing and research, and the screen does not bother me, even with my extremely poor vision.  Use the built in accessibility tools in Windows if you need to change your contrast, etc.\nThe sound from the speakers is surprisingly good for a laptop this inexpensive.\nThe violet color is closer to a nice blue.  (I actually thought they sent me the blue at first), and the HP emblem on top is a metallic purple, looks sweet! The newer models come in violet or a brighter cobalt blue. I do wish they had made a pink color similar to last years Orchid, but I really like the Violet, and it doesn't look like I'm a middle aged adult with a Hello Kitty obsession, especially if I take it to Panera or Starbucks to work on. This laptop is sleek and solid yet easy to carry anywhere because it's so light.  The white keys are a nice contrast on the gradient colored keyboard base. Easy to see and the keys have a nice feel and spring to them.\nThe battery life is terrific, the CPU processor is zippy,  and it boots very quickly.\nThe laptop stays remarkably cool, and it's soooo quiet! There is no fan since there is no hard drive, and it's weird if you are used to that fan purring when you're working away, but I've learned to treasure the silence!  I've read that with this type of drive storage, it's important to defrag often and regularly to keep it running swiftly with minimal errors.\nI tried my off brand (Gearhead) Bluetooth mouse with it, but it didn't recognize it, and I'm not blaming the laptop, it's probably the mouse. Even after loading a new battery in the mouse, the Stream failed to pick up its presence. I will try a more popular brand of Bluetooth mouse.  Some people have commented on the trackpad, but I actually had no problem getting used to it, and you can adjust the settings if you don't care for the defaults. It's not too stiff or too mushy to click. It's pretty accurate when following my touch. EDIT: I installed a name brand mouse and it worked just fine.\nThe RAM memory cannot be upgraded on the recent models, either, but I have not found it to limit me in any way. It's plenty enough for the functions that this laptop does best.\nMy sincere thanks to the many articulate reviewers before me who were honest in their reviews and influenced my decision to go ahead and buy this little gem. I love it.  It has many wonderful features and I would buy this over a Chromebook any day. If you're considering a Chromebook, consider this instead, because it is much more capable and is incredibly priced for what you get.\nIMPORTANT- read the reviews. Most of the people who are complaining don't understand what the concept behind this laptop is...they expect it to come with the features of a $750 laptop.  Or they don't understand how the storage works. One terabyte of cloud storage is a lot of storage!! And if you get the newer model like I did, the CPU is faster than the Horiizon blue or orchid colored models.  This is an incredible deal but it's not for anyone who expects it to do what a more expensive laptop would do.  If you don't know what\nthings are like the solid state drive is, look it up before you buy.\nSUMMARY-- it's an incredible value but research what you are getting and don't be put off by the negative reviews. Most of those people didn't research the product or had unrealistic expectations or lack basic computer skills.  And many people bought these on Black Friiday not even researching the product just because of the price point."}

I wanted something compact to travel with that could withstand a writing intensive semester. The subscription to Office 365 is awesome since I have to write frequent papers and care plans. I also had to do online testing assessments and had no problem browsing multiple windows and several applications open at a time.  It's a great size for note taking without clutter. Yes it's limited storage capacity, but it was nothing that getting rid of bloatware and an external SD card couldn't fix. And if you have extensive files, you get a boosted One Drive cloud storage so you don't have to ever worry about not having the save space. And to top it off, it's aesthetically one of the nicest laptops you'll ever see."}

It also asks you when choosing the laptop if you would like to purchase a protection plan for 2 years for$26, get it this too was worth every penny,I don't have tons if money for a geek squad member ship nor do I have the money to pay someone somewhere to fix my laptop should it break get the protection plan."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I just got my stream today and so far it's been pretty good. It tends to stutter and lag when multiple programs are running. Battery life is kinda disappointing at only 5 hours. The viewing angles are decent. Internet explorer is SO slow! I 'm thinking of changing over to chrome if it's compatible with this notebook This computer speed is okay. The keyboard is a good size, although the back space key is pretty tiny (not much of a personal issue for me at least). I have to say though, the touch pad kinda sucks. Trying to scroll through things is annoying as heck. I am getting a wireless mouse soon to make it a little easier on me. I like that it has a Microsoft app store. Although I do not like the start up menu on it, there's a bunch of useless apps that I'll have to delete. But I heard that you can go to your settings and change it back to a normal start up menu. It seems to look like it is sturdily built. Not to mention the design is fun! I like that it isn't a watered down version of Windows. Overall, if you're looking for a decent notebook under $200.00, this a decent option. I mainly bought it just for light internet use. There are some nice freebies such as a one free year subscription to Office 365 and 1TB of Cloud Storage. Although after this one gives out, I might invest in a slightly better notebook computer."}

I ordered violet purple and I ended up getting a BLUE one .. out of my excitement about getting a VIOLET PURPLE computer, I ended up buying a PURPLE laptop carrying case for it ...\nand lo and behold, I got a\nBLUE computer !!!\nSo now, I have a PURPLE protective carrying case for a BLUE computer.\n\nOne thing I am very happy about was the deal I got for Cyber Monday on it.\n My thoughts turned to disappointment when I had the thought of having to return to exchange it for the correct color  and when I have the feeling of is that Amazon would tell me that we don't have any purple ones left and you're going to have to buy it at the regular price instead of the Cyber Monday price.\n\nI love shopping with Amazon and I love their customer service ... so far, I've been very pleased with almost all of my purchases off of Amazon.\n\nAll in all, it is a good computer. I've had no problems with it yet.\nI've read most of the reviews and they've been very positive - this computer will only be used for browsing and ordering stuff online ... because sometimes, my tablet won't let me order because it won't register my email or a credit card,  which I don't or understand but regardless,  this laptop will be used only for traveling.  I don't plan on storing a million pictures on it or 100 apps ... I have a regular computer for that ... the way these computers are now adays, with no fans and the lighter the better.\nThis one is really light, perfect for traveling."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "First of all: this computer is NOT given enough brainpower to run the OS, let alone anything else! I can't even run pandora on it without major problems, and it won't run the version of MS Word IT COMES WITH. It hates firefox and even chrome runs slowly on it. And that touchpad! Ugh, gods save me from touchpads that are trying to be apple's single-click system. Gross! Don't get this! The only good thing about it is the monitor is super crisp and amazing and the machine doesn't overheat, but without any ability to add power or memory, you're better off using it as a super light satellite for only the most basic text editing or whatnot.\n\nFor reference, spouse and I both have one of these. This is what I ask my laptops to do:\n\n1. Run pandora or 8tracks on a continuous basis (I need to listen to music all the time due to misphonia)\n2. Run MS Word\n3. Run firefox (I prefer firefox to chrome due to a wider range of accessibility apps)\n4. Run telegram (a light IM app)\n\nSometimes, I would like this laptop to run audacity, which it does if that's ALL I'm doing.\n\nThis is not a lot to ask a computer to do simultaneously, right? This lappy can just about manage to run telegram. It's *atrociously* slow. My spouse has fared better, and has managed to get his to run:\n\n1. Chrome\n2. Telegram\n3. iTunes\n4. VLC media player\n\nNot all at the same time, but in combinations of 1, 2, 3 or 1, 2, 4. He still fights with the damn thing on a daily basis, and comments that it is extremely slow, and very fussy.\n\nIn my mind? This computer *might* do better running a version of Linux, but as I'm not a supergeek programmer, that's not possible. HP 'stream'lined this machine TOO MUCH, and it's a waste of money, even though it's cheap. About the only thing going for it is that it's tinysmol and has a GREAT mic/speaker/sound system. If all I wanna do is record something on audacity, this is the machine I use.\n\nWhat a waste of good hardware! It should have been made with more processing and memory capability, then it would have been able to take advantage of that sterling graphics and sound hardware!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I bought this computer just for something portable I can take and use on the go to get some light work done. It does comes with 32gb of on-board storage but you will run out really quickly. Just like any laptop you buy from a manufacturer it will come with a lot of bloatware, program you really do not need that will take up storage and each up that 2gb of ram. I suggest that yo claim your free one year subscription to Office 365 and 1TB of Onedrive cloud storage. Once you have claimed that I suggest you do a full clean install of Windows. That means opening up settings, go to recovery, and reset the pc. It will ask you if you want to keep your files or remove everything. Choose remove everything. This will do a fresh clean install of windows without all of the bloatware. Once your computer starts back up you will easily have about around 10gb of free space (it depends). This space you get back you can use for programs and windows update.\n\nFor storing Documents, photos, videos, etc. I highly recommend you get a micro SD card for storage and set the computer to automatically use the micro SD card for storing documents, programs (some will let you choose where to install them), and other things etc. This means going to settings again, select system then choose storage. Under Save Locations move everything to your microSD card.\n\nAs for performance its pretty good for the price you pay. I suggest not having anything running in the background of your computer at idle except for system task. You only have 2gb or ram and more or less 1gb or that ram will be used by the operating system. That means you have about 1gb for programs that you will run on the desktop. If I am not doing anything too specific for web browsing I would more likely use the Microsoft Edge browser since it takes up less system resources than Chrome.\n\nOther than that you get a pretty good computer for light web browsing and word processing. Its a great inexpensive first computer for first year college students or students in general or people who don't do many things other than light video watching (you can watch one 1080p video from Youtube but when you open another video and have two running at the same time the system throttles heavily mostly due to memory and processor bottle necking), word processing, and light web browsing."}

It's so perfect for me, I bought this laptop because my other HP laptop was too big and heavy and the back light went out two years ago and I never fixed it. I wanted something lighter, thinner and wouldn't be a hassle to take anywhere. I was worried about the storage space however, since Microsoft offers you 1TB free for a year, you can save everything to the cloud and you should not have any problems with this laptop. I'm a (new) vlogger and I needed something to edit my videos besides using my iPhone, I actually downloaded Movie Maker from the Microsoft website and it works perfectly fine. I was surprised actually for the price for this computer and what it can actually offer you. Some reviews scared me but I decided to take a chance, and I'm glad I did! There are some moments where it may run slow but that's because you have a lot of tasks open. Just remember to delete the apps you don't need so you will have more storage space.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I hope you have your reading glasses on, because it's about to be a long one. Grab a loved one and a hot beverage, sit back, and let me spin you a yarn that'll put you in the computer buying mood.\n\nFirst and foremost, this computer comes with Windows 10 Home Edition. I have a bit of a problem with Microsoft and Windows 10 since I wear a tinfoil hat on most days and believe that without your knowing consent, the operating system is keeping track of data from you and using it to tailor make advertisements for you, not only while browsing websites, but on your own start menu. If Microsoft and Advertisers get that sort of information about you, who else is getting that information? Do you care? Do you have \"nothing to hide\"? Am I going down a dark path you don't want to think about right now?\n\nAll of what I said just now is factual, just sort of look it up in your free time. Fortunately, you can turn off pretty much all of these things aside from Telemetry data (non-identifiable information about how your computer is being used such as program history and crash reports) that goes straight to the codemonkeys at Microsoft to help them make a better update in the future. Unlike Windows 7 and Windows 8, unfortunately, you will be getting that update, as Windows 10 Home comes with no way to turn off automatic updates. Technically, neither does Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise, but they do come with access to Group Policy Editor, which will allow advanced users to change the way Windows 10 handles automatic updates beyond what's advertised on the user friendly menus. In general, you're going to want to install some other OS on this little machine, because Windows 10 Home is criminally lacking. Perhaps you may want to downgrade to 8, or upgrade to a better version of 10, but unfortunately for me, it doesn't seem that 7 is an option as HP has seemingly discontinued support for drivers necessary to 7's installation. More experimentation for me, I suppose.\n\nNow, I know I just slammed Windows 10 pretty hard, but in truth, there's still a Microsoft operating system somewhere in there trying to help you have an enjoyable experience. Beyond all of the strange and potentially privacy invading settings, it's a solid operating system with a lot of useful (and worthless) applications built in. Out of concern for my own privacy I connected this laptop to my Wifi only long enough to download essential software for on the go work, and I haven't allowed it access to any network since. The connection was solid, though. Now, let's get to the part that's going to aggravate most normal users:\n\nThis is an HP PC first and foremost, and that means it's going to be preinstalled with about 50 pounds of worthless, redundant bloatware. I was actually surprised how little there was on this machine compared to devices I've purchased in the past, but it's still there and you're still going to want to remove it, along with the one year subscription to McAfee because it's just trash. The HP software tends to make the processor go up to 100% use quite often, so with it still on there, you're going to notice slowdowns for no apparent reason. Just poor optimization on the software's part, I assume. Fortunately, it's easy enough to take this stuff off, and it'll also let you reclaim a good chunk of your relatively small Hard Drive, which is solid state. The read times are incredible, and really, 32gb is enough for you to store the OS and any larger programs that you want to run quickly. For those of you who want to store your pictures and video and music and such - that adds up fast. I suggest buying an external hard drive, as it'll go at lightning speeds when it interfaces with the USB 3.0 port included on this laptop.\n\nPhysically speaking, this laptop is exactly what I wanted - a mobile computing option that is durable, more usable than a tablet, but still small enough to fit in a bag while I'm out and about. This laptop measures in at about 1 foot and some change in length, and its width is no more significant than one of those black and white composition books. It's incredibly lightweight, and while closed, the battery seems practically endless. With proper power management (dim screen, few programs, etc) you can get a workday's worth of use out of this little thing off of one charge. As strange as it is to say, my personal favorite part about this laptop is that it has no fans, and really, no moving parts at all. Not only does this eliminate weight, it really allows you to use and store this laptop anywhere without worrying what kind of dust it's going to suck up. Most people love having their laptops on their lap, or on a bed, and unfortunately, dust and fuzz gets sucked up in there and eventually becomes a problem, causing the processor to overheat or the fan to outright stop running in extreme cases. It makes no noise and keeps itself cool based purely on how little power it consumes. Even though it has a completely plastic shell, that tells me it was designed to last.\n\nThe keyboard being white on an otherwise all indigo laptop (and yes this is a very deep bluish purple, not violet as the name suggests) is a little disorienting, and I don't look forward to the fact that eventually, no matter how clean my hands are, the keyboard's going to start to look dirty. I would have much preferred black keys, or y'know, keys that match the color. The touchpad is honestly one of the worst I've ever used. The tracking can be jumpy and the buttons barely function. If you don't have a wireless mouse to go with this, Logitech makes many great ones at reasonable prices, look into them. I don't consider that worthy of detracting a star from this otherwise stellar laptop just because so much about the design makes me really happy.\n\nYou're hard pressed to find better for the price - I couldn't find a better deal even with Black Friday/Cyber Monday factored in. Some of that may depend on the kind of specifics I was looking for, but in general I'm happier with this purchase than I ever was with my old laptop which ran me twice as much as this one. My biggest gripes are honestly nitpicks about the fact that there isn't a model that comes with an AMD processor (I dislike Intel) and HP's apparent lack of concern for supporting Windows 7, even though Windows XP still received support for much longer after it became \"legacy\". On the advanced end of the spectrum, the BIOS is a bit lacking and doesn't seem to allow you access to the really advanced options unless you pull of some intense registry editing. I'm not too fond of the \"return\" of the Start Menu, since it's less of a start menu and more of 8's awful home menu squeezed into one little area. A step in the right direction, yes, but I don't want that pointless clutter in my start menu. A program called Classic Shell helps you get around that, and it's absolutely free.\n\nOverall a great purchase for all levels of experience."}

I haven't regretted it. I use it mostly as a netbook (that is, I open files from my online SugarSync drive), web-browsing, and for Exchange-based e-mail -- I like that I can use whatever Windows programs I want, unlike being tied to Google apps if I use a Chromebook. I did buy a 64GB microSD and keep a copy of my data files there; they're not always up to date, as SugarSync won't look at an external drive, but this way I do have access to old files easily if I need them. Because it's relatively cheap (I know $225 isn't nothing, but I'm in a situation where that's money I can afford to lose), I didn't worry when I took it traveling internationally to a variety of high-potential-theft places -- even if it was damaged, lost, or stolen, I hadn't lost my main machine or a huge investment. For about 6 weeks last summer, it was my only machine, and I didn't regret it.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "This is our second HP Stream in our home with middle school kids who spend hours each night with homework.  We loved the price of our first one purchased last summer and since this newer model came compliments of the Amazon Vine Program we were eager to give it a try.  Set up was around 20 minutes out of the box.  You have to have a Microsoft Account  or create a new one to use the features.  It's loaded with Windows 10 which takes a bit to adjust to especially if you are used to the older Windows versions.  You get one free year of Microsoft Office 365 which was simple to download.  The laptop itself is stylish and lightweight, easy to tote around all day if needed.  Connected easily to my wireless Epson printer.  Battery life was decent and gave us several hours of work time before needing a charge.  Touch pad was responsive and there are several USB ports and one HDMI port.  My main use will be to dump photos onto flash drives with this laptop since I like to store documents on my hard drive at home and this won't handle the storage.  I see other reviewers mentioned the machine slows down with lots of unwanted \"bloat\" but I haven't noticed anything terrible yet.  If I find after another month using this that I run into issues, I will update my review.  Otherwise we are happy!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I was able to get a refurbished one of these for about $160 and it was in amazing condition since it was factory refurbished. Amazing deal and amazing laptop given the price. It's super sleek and skinny and the keyboard is pretty good. The trackpad features are a little weird so I went into settings and turned off all the extras except for clicking and two finger scrolling. I had Win 8.1 for a little bit than freed up some space and upgraded it to Win 10, however I went into settings to optimize performance over appearance so it works decent given the hardware. It can't really multitask that well but for the price I don't really expect it to. I mostly use it for word and some basic internet surfing. I'd recommend getting the 13\" since the extra room on the keyboard and screen is worth it. The best part is probably the battery life, it lasts a super long time for such a cheap computer. If you're worried about not having space, or maybe you don't like saving things on the cloud, than you can just use a memory card or flash drive if you want the extra space to save stuff physically."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "This is a review based on first impressions, and on the use case for which we got the laptop.  I'll update if warranted.\n\nWe got this as a secondary laptop for use by a teacher at an elementary charter school.  She will be using it for Internet browsing, email, and working on Word docs.  Possibly Excel docs in the future.  Nothing too demanding.\n\nOnce I cleaned off the extraneous junk programs and got Office 365 installed and registered (free for a year), things worked well enough though slowly.  The keyboard is good.  What's left of the 32 GB SSD storage is enough for our purposes, especially if docs get stored in the cloud or on thumb drives or memory cards.  2 GB of memory is a tight limit; you won't do much multitasking.  But for browsing, email, and Word it's good enough.  The cheerful bright blue will fit in nicely at the elementary school.\n\nEXCEPT:  the touchpad is awful.  It simply does not respond properly to clicks and gestures, at least half the time.  We'll use a mouse instead.\n\nWindows 10 is an acquired taste, which we are in the process of acquiring.  At least it's better than Windows 8.  The jury is still out on the Microsoft Edge browser."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "First, let me acknowledge that I am in no way a computer expert.  My review of this product is merely my humble opinion by making a simple comparison between the current product and equipment that I've previously used.\n\nThe trackpad for this Notebook does not interact properly and I often have delayed responses - particularly when attempting a right click.  I found that I could avoid this by using a USB mouse.  The slowness however drove me crazy and made we want to throw the Notebook out the window.\n\nYou will need to delete a lot of garbage that is pre-loaded on this computer (temporary files, etc.) to free up the 32 Gig hard drive.  Once mine was cleaned up, I had 12 gigs left.  With a 32 Gig hard drive, 64 bit operating system, and only 2 gigabits of memory - this system is SLOW.  I updated a tablet at the same time as this laptop (the exact same updates were needed) and this laptop was much slower in uploading the updates.\n\nI really dislike that there is so little storage space on this laptop.  Users will have to be constantly saving photos, data/documents, files, music, etc. on the cloud storage as the 32 gig storage space will not allow much long term storage (most smart phones have more storage space than this).  This means that you will be uploading everything on the cloud, and when you need to use it again - you need to then download it. If you live in rural areas and your internet provider is slow, you may have wait times that are not insurmountable but very annoying when uploading and downloading.  The fee after the 1-year of free storage appears to be currently priced at $7 monthly.\n\nI find that this Notebook is practical for browsing the internet but for my use - that's about it.  I really don't like it and wish I would have realized that you cannot expand the RAM or storage space. The small 32 gig storage space ensures that you MUST use the cloud as opposed to having it be for optional long term storage."}

It has really good battery life, it is QUIET, and it does not get hot.  My MacBook Air has a lot better screen, and a lot better sound. But it runs hot, and has a loud, almost incessant fan.\n\nThis is a modest machine with a modest price.  It's not for everyone.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "This looked like an good laptop for basic use, so I ordered it. I find it to be fast enough for basic tasks, with a solid keyboard and decent screen.\n\nThere are some good points to this laptop:\n\n+ I wanted this device for basic word processing on the go, and for that purpose it is very good. It is not as convenient to pack as my former 11 inch, and at 4 lbs is a bit heavy, but is fine for a backpack.\n\n+ Overall I'm finding that I like the size - the screen is easy to see and quite readable. Some folks will complain about the relatively low screen resolution (1366x768), but in fact this resolution makes it excellent for basic word processing; it is much easier to read (and use, overall) than my more expensive Dell convertible.\n\n+ I like that HP bundled Office 365 with it, with a one year subscription. The files are executed off the hard drive, which makes it run faster.\n\n+ The keyboard is a bit small, but has very good backing and is absolutely silent in operation - great for a classroom. I like it for touch typing.\n\n+ The overall construction seems quite sturdy.\n\n+ The dedicated keys for home, page up, page down, end, print screen, and etc. are separate and easy to use. This is a fully functional keyboard, unlike some models where the keys have dual use.\n\n+ The touchpad works very well, with a solid left and right click. More importantly, the keyboard is situated such that I was not constantly accidentally hitting the touchpad and moving the cursor. I've had some laptops for which I've actually had to disable the touchpad because it interfered with typing - not this one.\n\n+ With the default power saving settings, I was able to get 5 hours of screen time. I think this could be pushed with tweaking and turning on airplane mode.\n\n+ OK, it is only cosmetic, but I really like the blue color. In fact, the overall design is stylish, while not sacrificing sturdy build quality.\n\n+ Three USB ports, although only one is 3.0. What I don't like is that the 3 port is not colored blue, which is industry standard.\n\n+ The 3mm port supports both headset and microphone, which means you can plug in an earbud or basic handsfree for use with Skype and etc. This leaves the USB ports free for other tasks.\n\n+ The full size HDMI port is great for playing movies.\n\n+ The supplied charger is very small (a mini brick), which will fit better in the backpack.\n\nThere are some things that are less good.\n\n- I found that the hard drive has only 15 GB free when booted up. Fortunately, it does have a MicroSD storage slot (unusual, since most have a standard SD), which can be used to store files. They also provide a one year subscription to OneDrive for a full TB of data.\n\n- The screen is not touch sensitive, but at this price point that is just a note, not a drawback.\n\n- The antivirus is only good for a single month, and ironically, it looks like I will have to uninstall it and reinstall the same program so that I can register it. Mcafee allows unlimited computers to use the same license at home, and it actually works very well.\n\n- There is some HP bloatware, but that can be easily removed. This is frustrating on a machine with limited storage space.\n\n- I did notice that the laptop has a definite way of operating - occasionally it will slow down for a brief second. But it is not noticeable in general, and did not detract from using it. I attribute this to the Celeron processor and limited memory. You have to work with the machine, rather than fighting it.\n\n- When using this laptop, you will want to stay with the basics. This machine is not at all suited for gaming, or heavy database / spreadsheet use. Programs can take a few seconds to come up, but then they run fine. I don't plan on running more than a couple of major programs at a time. I'm actually impressed with how well it works with only 2GB of main memory. Once everything completes the boot process, it runs well. I did not bother running PC diagnostics - if you are interested in those numbers, don't bother with this machine!\n\nSummary: A very decent laptop for student use, at a great price. Highly recommended for light word processing and excel."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I recently purchased this laptop 3 months ago for $200. I purchased it for the purpose of using it for college and I needed one to do work and study. I will be going over some pros and cons with this laptop and will also give it a evaluation.\nPros:\n-This laptop is cheap and affordable. For $200 there aren't going to be much that are better than this\n-It also came with a $25 Microsoft gift card and 1 free year of Microsoft Office. Now those two items alone can be worth up to $100, probably more. Spending $200 on a cheap laptop and getting at least $100 back? Ill take that deal again any day.\n-Its reliable; while this is a cheap and reliable laptop, it has also gotten pretty slow over the months. At first it was pretty fast and I was amazed. Then as time went on it started to show why it was only $200. Although its gotten pretty slow, it still gets the job done and hopefully (fingers crossed) it doesnt get slower as its still usable and reliable now.\n-The life on the battery is pretty good. Ive used my laptop for 7 hours straight before doing work and listening to music, and I still had battery left over when I finished.\n- This laptop also shipped to me in Windows 10, which is amazing. Unfortunately it does take up most of your space as this laptop doesnt have that move space.\nCons:\n-The keyboard takes some getting used too, and after 3 months Im still getting used to it. Its pretty small and if you have big hands, you should probably buy a separate keyboard that suits you.\n-Clicking things can also be frustrating. Whenever trying to click on things, sometimes the computer doesnt register it and I have to click it 2 or 3 times. Its as if the key needs to be clicked on harder than most keys.\n-No storage space. Even though it says its 32GB its not. Also after Windows 10 theres little to no room for storage. So if you're thinking of downloading a big program or anything I would advise against it; this is also probably why its been running slow lately as it keeps saying Im about to run out of storage room.\nFor $200 this is a pretty decent laptop. Would I spend an extra $200 dollars for a better more efficient laptop? Probably yeah. Does this get the job done? Yes, Ive written multiple essays, and still do, and Ive also studied a lot with it. If you just need a cheap laptop to get work done then buy this laptop. If you're looking for anything else Id advise you to buy another laptop.\nRating: 7.5/10"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "Okay, so I`ve had this computer about a week so take that into account on my review.  I have read every single review and was prompted to give my review because I take issue with many of the things I have read.  First, I have the blue one, not the purple one that so many seem to want to avoid the \"crapware\".  Microsoft is selling the purple one in their store and, at first, I was tempted to take mine back to Walmart and buy that one because of so much fuss about the crapware.  However, as I played with mine I realized I was not having any issues with it.  I did eliminate the programs I did not need like bonjour and a few others to free up some space.  I upgraded to Windows 10, put in all the updates and added flash player, java and firefox.  I currently have 8.3 GB of free space and added a 32 GB SD card.\n\nI want everyone to know you do not have to be tech-savvy to have a good running machine so do not be put off by what you may have read in regards to eliminating everything.  I have all my HP software still on my PC and it works great.  Furthermore, I find the HP utility center to be very helpful.  Maybe it does effect the speed but I certainly have not found that to be a problem.  The only issue I have is with the touch pad which many times requires another touch or two to select an item.  I can live with that.  I tried Youtube and had no problems viewing the various clips as well as playing a movie from my USB drive.  Bottom line, I absolutely love this little computer.  It does exactly what I want, is easy to carry and the battery lasts a very long time.  Buy it, you won`t be disappointed unless, of course, you get a lemon in which case you simply return it and get another one.\n\nFinal thoughts:  I`m thinking of uninstalling firefox, not because there is a problem but because Microsoft Edge works very well.  I see no need for two browsers.  Also, we are coming up on Black Friday so you might want to wait and see if these little gems are discounted further.  I got mine at Walmart for $179 ($193.50 with tax).  Microsoft still wants $199 as of this writing.  Hope this review has helped someone.  Enjoy the Stream and happy computing!"}

I purchased a 64 GB MicroSD to give him more storage, and I deleted whatever applications I felt were unnecessary to increase speed and startup time. A November 12, 2014 comment on Amazon.com helped me sift through and delete applications that could be considered bloatware.\n\nThe laptop is mainly used by my son for watching assigned homework videos, for typing reports, and doing light research. My son has not had to take it to school yet, but its light weight makes it very easy to transport.\n\nThe keyboard is easy to type on, however the mouse pad can be unresponsive at times. Weve solved that by getting him an external mouse. Overall I think this computer fills a gap for first laptop users (young kids) and for other users looking for a Windows computer at a Chromebook price. Plus the one year subscription to Office Online, and a $25 Microsoft App Store gift card made this purchase worth it."}

We ordered the Magenta colored one for him and the color is really pretty. It comes with Windows 8.1, has 32GB of storage and 2 GB memory, which was just fine for him since he is just using it for stuff like Facebook. If he decides  he needs more space there is a spot for an SD card.  The screen is 11.6 in. and the laptop weighs a little over 2 lbs.  so he can take it wherever he goes. One thing we did not realize until he received it is that it does not have a CD drive.  The keyboard and mouse are easy to use and he hasn't had a problem with them sticking at all. Sometimes it does take some time to get things to load correctly but then again that is to be expected with a cheaper laptop.  He uses it a lot so he really likes that he can be on it for 7 or 8 hours before he needs to charge it.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "The HP Stream 11.6 represents a cost-engineered laptop that makes decisions on what to leave in, and leave out to meet a low target price. With this in mind, I didn't expect a powerhouse, but instead a small, lightweight laptop for conventional computer tasks (Web surfing, Skype, Office). Given this low threshold, the laptop succeeds.\n\nSo, what is left out? The storage is slim; of a reported 28 GB of space, only 12.5 GB of space is free. Clearly, the thought is that this laptop will leverage cloud storage for much of it's storage space, whether it be Microsoft's or someone else (Dropbox is pre-installed, with a 25 GB capacity). The screen is decent, if not stellar with good viewing angles. The body is all plastic, in my case made of a nice shade of blue. The webcam offers an image of a entry level webcam - a slightly noisy image. The trackpad is not the best I have used, but with a little tweaking it is acceptable - tracking is a little sluggish even at a faster speed.\n\nSo - the positives -  it is reasonably snappy. It boots quickly, applications launch with little hesitation. It is true that there are faster SSD drives out there, but the included drive works well for it's intended purpose. The keyboard is actually decent; a little plasticy but action is acceptable and layout is comfortable. I tried Office, Paint. Net, Chrome, playing back Youtube videos, and it all worked fine. It ships with Windows 10, which is a significant improvement over Windows 8. The start menu is actually quite useful, and for myself - the mail client works well - and will work easily with email sources other than Microsoft's (such a Google). The laptop is fairly lightweight and the case is rigid (despite it being plastic). Battery life is surprisingly good; I was able to get 9 hours of use, a combination of email, web surfing, watching videos, working in Microsoft word and Paint.net. It does include some extraneous applications that most will ignore, or delete, plus a trial version of McAfee. It comes with Office 365 for a year. It has a microSD slot, an easy and cheap way to add additional storage for files to the laptop.\n\nThe laptop is clearly targeted for those who might otherwise buy a cheap Chromebook. For some the HP Stream may be a better option, simply because the Windows OS allows for more flexibility in applications being installed, keeping mind that there is a hard limit due to the scant storage space for applications. It may make sense for someone who a few years ago would have been tempted by a netbook (the HP Stream is better than many due to it's keyboard). It might make sense as a laptop for a kid, or for someone who just wants an inexpensive laptop to take to a coffee shop and get some work done (and in fact, that's what I've used it for). It is true that for a bit more someone can get a more capable laptop (prices have plummeted) so that should definitely be taken into consideration. But as it stands on it's own, it is a decent, inexpensive laptop that is a viable alternative to a Chromebook"}

You get multiple notifications regarding the memory every time you boot up, every time you try to save a simple document, and every few days because of the temporary internet files.  \"Oh well,\" I thought. I'll just upgrade the memory and install it myself. Nope.  Can't be upgraded.  It gets worse.  The video driver needs an upgrade. Not enough memory. About 10% of the time you switch between apps, the screen just blacks out, especially between PowerPoint and Microsoft edge. Sometimes just switching tabs on internet explorer causes the screen to go black. When it comes back on, I get a message that tells me to install critical updates for the video driver. Well I can't. Worse yet, about half the time that the screen goes black, it doesn't come back on so it has to be manually restarted.

I have only spent a few hours with it but I thought I would post a quick review. It seems like a lot of computer for the money, it has a very solid feel. The only complaint I have is my touchpad has a slight rattle, when you tap it lightly you can hear and feel a rattle. It is hard to explain but it does not have the same tight, spring-loaded feel of other laptop touchpads I have used. I usually use an external mouse so it should not be an issue.\n\nI did not test performance other than playing some YouTube videos at 720p and the performance seemed good. I plugged in a 23 inch LCD TV to the HDMI port and that looked very good and the audio played through the TV speakers automatically and sounded good. I checked the disk with the Windows Disk Management Utility and it shows it has a 29 GB Hynix HBG4e with a 260 MB EFI partition, 21.54 GB NTFS C: drive (4.3 GB used, 17.2 GB free) and a 7.20 GB Recovery partition.\n\nChangin...

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "We own three computers. I run Window 8.1 for web site development and maintenance. This was purchased to replace my laptop for use when traveling. The unit bought is the 13.3 inch, non-touch screen, Windows 10 HP laptop. It had too many problems out of the box; I returned it. First, the sound was the worst I have ever heard on any computer, (very, very tinny), which I figured I could somehow fix later, so I continued the installation. It failed three times copying files from a remote server over the internet to the local hard drive; the failures hung the program, which had to be killed from the Task Manager. Three other times, when copying from a USB flash drive to the local hard drive it also failed, once giving the message \"not enough memory,\" yet there was 12 GB free; that USB port, (the one on the left), was then dead until the computer was restarted, but the flash drive worked in either of the other two right ports just fine. Is it a problem with Windows 10 or the Stream or both? I don't know, but I am unwilling to spend more than the 7 hours it took to remove the bloatware, install the programs I use every day, and then remove it all before returning it.\n\nThe good news is Amazon's return policy; that is why there is a two-star review instead of one-star review."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "So this thing is basically a tablet with a keyboard and lots of ports to connect peripherals. The ports were my reason for buying this instead of a tablet - you can get data, applications, etc off of it without a network or cloud.\n\nI followed suggested, \"remove crapware\", instructions in other's reviews and as they say it runs smoothly thereafter. I can open a bunch of tabs in Chrome and the CPU averages about 6% and I'm not having any trouble with typical browsing. Hulu and Netflix work smoothly and the HDMI out runs without skipping at 1080p.\n\nBattery life is at least as advertised. I use it most of the day without plugging in, regardless of what I'm doing with it.\n\nIt's very light weight so is easy to sit on the couch with or carry around. It feels kind of cheap / plasticky - like when the lid is closed and you carry it around the two halves aren't secured, they, \"clack\", a little. I type for a living and I can type pretty well on the chicklet keys. For $225 I guess I can't complain about the build - it all works.\n\nTurning DTS off is a big deal if you use the microphone for Skype, etc. With it on you sound like you're in a tunnel. There aren't any visible DTS applications anywhere, you have to type, \"dts\", at the search prompt and run the located program and turn it off. It's not a studio quality mic but at least you sound like you.\n\nThe 32 gB storage is really bare minimum, you don't really have much room to install anything. It comes with 12 mos of Office, but you have to install it and yes, it takes space. I installed Office and just a few other applications and I have 6 gB left. Even though I expected this I am still surprised how little space is left and I'm getting used to doing everything off USB sticks. Right now I'm too chicken to update to WIndows 10, mostly because the disk space thing leaves me thinking I'd wind up with a rescue operation and a lot of wasted time and the words about, \"drivers won't be recognized\", spooked me a little."}

It can't even handle the \"Free Windows Update\" it offers. This was confirmed by a HP Senior Case Manager. Even simple educational Flash videos drain ALL of the system resources- literally (98%). The HP senior case manager that helped me was actually VERY good. Unfortunately, the only resolution to this problem is returning it to Windows 8.1 and only using it for light use. We will have to purchase a completely different computer to run WINDOWS 10 & pretty much anything else. DO NOT INSTALL WINDOWS 10 & DO NOT USE FOR GAMING.\n.......................\nI bought this for my 2nd grader who is enrolled in Virtual Public School. I was looking for something light, easy to use, & portable. Having Windows 10 is important because it is the same as what she has been using since school started in August.\n\nWindows 10 upgrade may be free- but there isn't enough memory on the laptop to install it. I tried SEVERAL ways (SD cards & USB storage, all large & fast enough for the upgrade). The update would be almost complete when it would notify me, without reason, that it would not work. I was eventually successful using an external hard drive.\n\nThis computer is EXTREMELY SLOW. I do NOT recommend this for gaming. EVERYTHING is slower, including the Internet (none of our other Laptops & desktops have this problem). I was able to pick up some speed by removing ALL system animations & other tweaks. It's still ridiculously slow- even my 8 year old knows it's abnormal!.\n\nI installed a large, fast mini-SD card for extra memory. It's good for saving pics, docs, music, etc. I can't get the system to use it as default (especially for things like Windows Apps).\n\nI wish I could return this (especially for an upgrade).

When I called the company, I was talking to someone in India, with a very think accent that I could not understand, After talking to him for 15 minutes, he transferred me to another debt, and they were unable to help me as well. I was going to have to find a repair shop in my area and turn in it for them to ship to the manufacturer. There were none in my city and I wouldn't even find one in the state. I called Best Buy but even thou they sold the same model they would not look at it without charging me money. It was a $199 Computer, and it would have cost me more to fix than to buy a new one -which is what I did. And not that model and not thru Amazon."}

While it isn't great, the HP Stream 11.6-Inch Laptop (Intel Celeron, 2 GB RAM, 32 GB SSD, Cobalt Blue), will be a sturdy addition to your home.\n\nEssentially, it feels like a toy. I mean that in the best way. It is colorful and feels less dainty than my other laptop (a medium-end Windows-based product). As it is much smaller, and because the price-point is low, it is easy to grab-and-go into meetings.\n\nIt is all in there, everything you expect in a Windows machine. That's a plus. The downside is the hardware. The thing is slow, the resolution is weak and the keyboard feels awkward. Granted, because the it is smaller, the keyboard is also smaller, but it is difficult to get used to.\n\nI like it as an extra computer on which I don't store anything like photos or documents. It is excellent as a way to Skype, YouTube and Netflix, as well as some insignificant surfing. Bring it to the beach without worry.\n\nDon't think of this as a laptop, but as more of a tablet (minus the ability to use a touch screen).\n\n--Brockeim"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "This is a tiny, small inexpensive made portable demi-netbook, suitable for a child or someone whose computer needs are focused on internet activity or someone who doesn't have the money to purchase something more durable with a larger screen.  It came pre-loaded with windows 10, and full of software 'free for a while' that you will have to pay for after the subscription period ended. It is not super fast, but not super slow, although my 5 year old dell runs faster. For me it is functional, but closer to a toy than a piece of serious hardware. But if you take into mind the audience you are purchasing it for, it might suit a certain type of user. Someone who wants to chat, check facebook, browse Amazon, and whose vision is great, might do well on this small tablet-sized machine. For a person trying to do more, this machine might be too limited.\n\nIt boots, and immediately wants to find your wifi router. Connecting to wifi was simple and easy. I was on the internet in minutes, mostly because I had to add this machine's mac address to my mac address filter.\n\nLooks wise, it is cute. It is bright blue plastic, resembling a toy computer. The keyboard is responsive, the track pad is a single piece, the screen narrow and tiny but appealing with a backdrop of pre-selected icy snow.\n\nI probably wouldn't purchase a machine like this, as I need more robust power, but if you are looking to gift grandma with a computer to check her email this might be something you might buy- as long as granny has good vision. I would be concerned about using this for children, as it is a heavily internet reliant piece of hardware, but that's each parents decision to make.\n\nThis machine doesn't blow me away, but it isn't bad either. It is a solid piece of technology for what it is."}

Then her health declined sharply near the middle of August and the laptop (still working well) was placed aside on the charger.

Won't start on battery; won't start with power cord plugged in; just blank.  Power cord has been checked; power on switch has been checked; NOTHING.\n\nThere is no indication that it is getting power except that the bottom is very warm so power is going somewhere.  I don't know if this HP version has a safety cutoff switch or not.

It has taken me that long to get everything updated, and all my programs installed, lol  I have to say that I wasn't very happy with the touch screen, I didn't think it was very responsive, nor was I happy with the touchpad, also not very responsive. (I had a little Acer before this, that I thought was much better in these two areas)  However, today I finally had a chance to go to HP's website and did find a bunch of updates directly from them, and holy cow!  Total difference in that how this runs now! It's like a different computer!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that after you get this baby home, you go straight to HP's website and do your updates from there first. Then go and get your windows updates, and then add your personal programs.\nI have to say, I now am impressed with this little laptop! It has lots of storage, the cloud, the SSD may be small, but there is room on an SD card, also. And even though this has a celeron processor, it works just as well as my 17.3\" laptop! I must admit, I'm a processor snob, lol, but things have changed on that score, and this one is just fine for what I need it for. I also wanted to say that I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the white keyboard. It's so much easier to see the keys, I much prefer it over a black one, although, I do stay up late at night, and a backlit one would have been nice. ( I like to sit in the dark)  So, this little baby is working great for me now, and I'm very happy I bought it. I highly recommend this little laptop for basic web browsing, and doing all those things we all like to do online. I don't know much about gaming, you'll have to trust someone else's word on that. Good Luck, and I'm kinda liking HP!  :)"}

It failed during an attempted upgrade to Windows 10, but the operating system files for the upgrade have been partially installed by Microsoft.  As a result, I have no disc space left:  it is all allocated to Windows files.  It is not \"Windows 10 Ready\" as advertised.\nIt has never been able to run my peripherals:  a projector or an external DVD player.  On 2/11/16, the power cord intake broke.  The pin inside the intake is loose and it appears to be chipped.  I do not handle my electronic devices roughly.  I unplugged it to pack it and take it away from home, and when I tried to plug it back in the cord would no longer fit.  Now, of course, the battery is dead.  Its best feature is its light weight, but this prevents me from using it as a doorstop.  I can't think of any other practical use for it.\nIt was originally advertised at $159.  Three weeks after ordering it, the seller had not begun processing the order, and the price had increased to $197.  When I emailed the seller to cancel the order, it suddenly shipped:  seriously, later the same day, it shipped.  I don't recommend the seller, and I have no love for HP.

Beats netbooks and chromebooks in versatility IMO.\nI bought the 13 inch for nearly the same price for another family member, which I personally think is a better deal, but like I said some people will want the smaller form factor.\nHighly recommend"}

I compare this to the<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Asus-Transformer-Book-10-1-inch-32GB-Detachable-2-in-1-Touch-Laptop-Tablet-T100TA-With-Keyboard-Dock-Grey-Certified-Refurbished/dp/B015GGPP3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Asus Transformer Book 10.1-inch 32GB Detachable 2-in-1 Touch Laptop/Tablet T100TA With Keyboard Dock - Grey (Certified Refurbished)</a>(64 GB Storage) that I recently bought myself, and love. Comparing the two systems, I love the wider spread keys of the HP's keyboard, and the lighter weight of the system overall, when holding it in the hand, but I like that my ASUS has a touchscreen tablet/screen that I can disconnect and use independent of the keyboard dock.\n\nThe resources of the two systems are about the same, so the performance is similar, as well. Because of that, I find the HP to be a bit slow to respond when multiple tabs are open, especially considering all the bloatware that comes loaded on the system. Once the greater portion of that is removed, you're likely to find that you have more than just the 15 GB of system memory that my system currently has, pre-bloatware removal.\n\nIt's easy enough to pick up a Micro SD card to add more storage to this system, but it's never going to run high-demand games or any other resource-demanding software... of course, it's not meant to run that sort of software, either.\n\nOverall, I like this system. The colors it's offered in are great and bright, thus very eye-catching. The resources are on-point for a basic, travel-friendly netbook. For the price, you really can't go wrong with the HP Stream, as long as you keep in mind what it's meant to do."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "This is a little no frills computer, but it is quite pretty.  It has very little bloatware on it. After I got it optimized and cleaned out, it has turned out to be a zippy little thing that boots up faster than any laptop I have ever owned.  It does not have a big memory, but it does have a card slot and usb ports if you are open to using external storage.  I prefer keeping my sensitive stuff, photos, etc off my internal hard drive so that suits me just fine. I used to restore old computers and give them away--and from that, learned to love HP and Compaq as practically un killable.  I had strayed to other brands for a few years and this is my first HP in quite some time.  I am remembering why I was so loyal to this brand!"}

I like the look of this laptop. It's cute. It's very light and slim. I wasn't expecting the audio to be this good. The image is of quality too. It came with 1 year Office 365, which is very helpful for a college student. So far so good. It has been a good laptop for the price I paid. The only thing I am not sure if I like is the battery. I was used to the batteries that you could replace but this one is built-in. Oh! Also the battery life lasts pretty long. Last time I calculated it took 6 hrs and half and I downloaded stuff and watched videos."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00NSHLUBU", "review": "I do not like this computer at all, but I needed a new one on a budget a few years ago, so I bought this one. However, it seems HP is not doing extremely well at the moment, and I now realize that purchasing this was a mistake. The disk space is always low due to the constant updates, and someone needs to go to the updates and find old updates to uninstall. However, this is easier said than done. With countless files under an old update, uninstalling the wrong one can leave  a computer crippled and even completely broken. I am upgrading to a more expensive laptop with 4 times the memory after dealing with this piece of junk.\n\nThat being said, I never was able to even install Microsoft Office, Excel, and the like. Any program I installed for school was immediately uninstalled once I was finished with it. This still did nothing to help with my memory issues. For someone who deletes my downloads, temporary files, and does not store pictures or any large files, the memory still was not enough! Google Docs and Drive was my savior when it came to utilizing this computer for homework, etc. Without its existence this computer is useless. I would not recommend this computer to any student, spent $500 more and get something else."}
