Lighter than last years model.\n+Great quality front & rear cameras (though don't look like a major fool and hold the nexus 7 overhead to use the camera to record at public events...you know what I'm talking about)\n+Almost full day battery life for most people (specs @ 10 hrs.)\n+HDMI out. Watch movies, videos, etc. on the big screen. Awesome!\n+4G data available (LTE)\n\nCons:\n+No expandable memory -- we get it, we can use cloud storage (google music, google drive), but there are some times when you want to have a whole bunch of media/games on hand, like say a long international flight\n+Lingering build quality concerns based off problems that some users had with original Nexus 7 model\n\nRecommendations:\nIf you are an early adopter, you probably bought this...\nIf you have last years model, you'll see benefits from the better screen, hdmi out and performance, so it's probably worth the upgrade (caveat: wait if you're on the fence due to the build quality)\n\nIn the market for a 7\" tablet? Buy this!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "*** This review is for a 32GB, WiFi only tablet.\n\nI just picked one of these little guys at my local BB presale because I'm impatient and had to try one. Yes, I actually have one and I'm not BS'ing.\n\nBeing an IT professional, I've used a variety of Android and Apple devices, probably dozens at this point. I'm well versed in Apple, Android and Microsoft world, and have a MCSE/MCSA and half a dozen other MS/IT certs, so I know what I'm talking about.\n\nI suspect it will take a month or two before I'm fully versed in the eccentricities of this tablet, but here is my 3 hours of use review:\n\nFirst Impressions:\n\nUpon receiving the box, I was pleasantly surprised by how small and minimal it is. Very similar to Apple packaging, which is best in the business in my opinion. Upon turning it on and signing into my Google account, I was immediately greeted by several updates. 0-day updates to be expected from a major release and are appreciated.\n\nAs usual, my Google account wanted to sync all my previous Play Store apps onto the device which I immediately stopped. No stupid Verizon apps for you! One of my primary reason for getting this tablet was for gaming. I'm disappointed by the horridly slow memory on my old Kindle Fire, and I hate the uphill battle that comes with trying to Jailbreak and install emulators on Apple tablets. I nearly bought a Nexus 7 Gen1 until I heard it had slow storage as well. Once I heard that Nexus 7 Gen2 had greatly improved storage speeds, as well as better specs down the board, I was sold. I won't bore you with all the specs, as you can read those in the Amazon description above. However, I must point out one particularly great spec that this tablet has, and many covet: a 1080p screen on a 7\" tablet. There are no current 7\" tablets on the market that match that PPI, but I'm sure Apple's iPad mini 2 will match or come close to it. (when it comes out)\n\nPerformance:\n\nI have no gear to officially test the dynamic contrast and black levels of the screen, but CNET (Normally Apple biased) gave a very impressive 570/0.44 cd/m2 for it's max brightness/black level, putting it at 1,295:1 contrast ratio, beating the socks off the iPad Mini's 814:1, and the old Nexus 7 at 1,028:1. I notice this most in black and white movies like Casablanca, (my usual test) but color also pops much better too. The color levels are more accurate across the board than the greenish tint of the first N7, and give Apple a run for the money.\n\nIf gaming is your target, it's interesting to find that the Nexus 7 Gen2 meets or exceeds the iPad Gen4. GFXBench tests put the N7g2 consistently in line with the iPad, no small feat for a sub-$300 device. I confirmed this performance by playing a number of games and finding that I couldn't slow this little guy down; Galaxy on Fire's new android release, Project Y, and a host of old standbys. It runs an Adreno 320, the same as the mighty HTC One, so if an HTC One plays it well, the Nexus 7 will too. It also typically beats a Nexus 10 in all tests, so if your choice between these two tablets is speed, the N7 is the obvious winner.\n\nWhen I got the tablet it was at 50% battery life. It took about 2 hours before it was at 100%. I'm guessing it will take 3-4 hours with the shipped charger to bring it from 0 to 100.\n\nOther improvements:\n\nThe improvements in Android 4.3 are not going to be apparent for a while, as the main improvements are OpenGL ES 3.0 and app security permissions. However, it also includes battery improvements which seem to stretch an additional hour of video watching despite it's slightly smaller battery. It's also a little thinner than the 1st gen Nexus 7, by around 1.8mm. Usually thin tablets annoy me and are awkward to hold, but the Nexus 7 has comfortable rounded sides and a soft rubber back. The front is a fingerprint magnet of course.\n\nValue and software:\n\nLast but not least, the Nexus 7 is only $230 for a 16GB model, or $270 for 32GB. Compare this to an iPad mini at $330 for a 16GB model, or a 32GB at $430. The original Nexus 7 seems to be going for under $200 now, so if all you need is a nice internet browser and like to dabble in everything else, the Nexus 7 Gen 1 is actually a great deal.\n\nA last positive comes in the form of the Apple/Android philosophy. This baby comes ready to be loaded up with any ROM you chose, as do all of the Nexus series. There aren't any real releases yet, but I expect there to be some great ones over the next few months. Apple does it's best to prevent Jailbreaking. If you don't know the benefits of either, and consider yourself a tinkerer, then you may want to brush up on them.\n\nThe other part of this Android/Apple philosophical difference takes the place of Apple censorship. I HATE IT. Apple tries it's best to keep it's store locked down with American prude censorship. Google doesn't. Apple also nixes nearly any emulator apps they can. This means no DOSBox, SNES, NES, Genesis and Playstation emulators for you if you're stuck on an Apple device. That sucks a big one. One of the big reasons I will not pick up an IOS device.\n\nNow for negatives:\n\n1.) The obvious being that the Google Play Store gets some games later than the Apple App Store. Nearly all the \"good\" games are available on both within months, but the tendency is for Apple to get the initial release followed closely. by Play Store. However, the total number of Apps in either store is now shifted into Google's favor, as it now has over 1,000,00 apps compared to Apple's 900,000+, with the lead growing each month. So let the stupid, \"My tablet has more apps\" argument die, as it doesn't matter anymore.\n\n2.) The widescreen format and shape can be awkward for some, but I got used to it quickly.\n\n3.) There is no SD card slot. We already expected this as the previous didn't have one, but I really wish it had one so I could load it up with music and movies. Heck, I've got a 64GB microSD card in my phone. Why can't a much larger tablet have one too?\n\nOther than that, I am struggling to find a negative with this tablet. Once again, I think I'll give it a few weeks before I can fully flesh out this review. Until then, I'm gonna enjoy messing with this little guy.\n\nEdit: 48 hours later...\n\nNow that I've had the tablet for a couple days and kicked it around a bit more, I'm still holding firm on my previous statements. I've loaded up Jet Set Radio, Dolphin, Labtech Control Center and a number of other apps to see how well it handles a variety of content. I must say, I'm not having any issues. I loaded up 3DMark so I could see for myself how well it handles a heavy load on it's GPU, and it breezed through even on Extreme, achieving a score of around 6300. The first Nexus is only able to pull off around 1900, making the new model over 3 times faster.\n\nThe battery life has been good, as it seems to still have 25-50% charge after a day of moderate to heavy use.\n\nOne detail I didn't realize before, but now find apparent is that while the speakers sound good for built in tiny tablet speakers, the volume levels are capped to achieve this. Before the speakers begin to distort bass, the top volume levels out. I kind of wish it could go little further so I could use it for a portable radio while I'm cleaning, but I suppose headphones will fix that. It fits in a pants pocket like a big mp3 player, something I can't pull off with an iPad mini. The iPad mini is 5.3 inches wide, while the Nexus 7 is about 4.7 inches. The widescreen just barely makes it into a back or side pocket without being too tight.\n\nEdit: 7/29\n\nAnother detail I've heard from at least one reviewer is that of dead pixels. I HIGHLY recommend running the free app, \"Dead Pixel Test\" as soon as you can. I discovered only two dead pixels on my tablet, both in the top. One is incredibly hard to see except at an angle, and only then in complete black. The other is slightly more visible, but only at an angle again. Dead pixels are to be expected on an high density display, so be extra diligent to identify whether or not your display has a serious problem with dead or stuck pixels. Mine are minor, but a few significant reports have surfaced.\n\nEdit: 8/6/13\n\nAfter around 2 weeks of use, I'm very happy with the tablet. It has done well with battery life throughout a day or two of moderate use and occasional gaming. I'm waiting on an ultra-slim case from Moko, but would like to see that \"Premium Official Case\" come out so I can decide if it's worth it. Word on the street is the official travel case is not worth the $20 they are asking.\n\nEdit: 9/18/13\n\nI've now had the tablet for almost 2 months and I'm 100% sold on it. It's fast, reliable and just about the perfect size for taking anywhere. I take it to customer sites to use WiFi-Analyzer, take notes, check email, Remote Desktop into PCs/Servers, change configs on network equipment and many other things. My Kindle Fire is now converted into a semi-dedicated iTunes remote because I'm so spoiled by the responsiveness of my Nexus 7.\n\nAlso, I rooted it about a week or so ago and put a lean version of 4.3 on it. It's even faster now! I also love the Moko ultra-slim case I put on it. It doesn't add bulk, the magnetic clamps seem to be holding up, and it looks nice.\n\nhttp://smile.amazon.com/MoKo-Google-New-Nexus-Case/dp/B00CKA1IYU/ref=pd_cp_pc_2\n\nI'm a very satisfied fan of this tablet.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Probable\" final update, 11/12/15\n\nIf anyone is still checking this tablet out, here's a final addition to the review. I've had the table for over two years now, and I'm still happy with it and frequently use it for web browsing as well as light gaming, such as Clash of Clans. Its battery still maintains a nice long charge even after continual use for 2 years, and it still does a good job of handling day to day tasks.\n\nMarshmallow, Android 6.0, was pushed out to the tablet over the past month, and seems to be very stable on it.\n\nI guess my review stands. I still really like this tablet. It's still a good value and solid platform."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "This is 2013's best small tablet out there. Improvements over the 2012 nexus 7 model in every way. GPU, CPU, RAM, screen resolution, rear camera, you name it. But don't take my word for it. Go to cnet or the verge.com. Cnet gave it an \"excellent\" rating, while The Verge gave it a score of 9.0 out of 10. And these are tech sites that love their apple products. Browse just about every tech site... and they recommend it. The screen alone is incredible."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I just recently got my nexus 7, so for me to write a full review is not really fair but let me give my first impressions since this product is new and people would like a fresh perspective before buying one.\n\nI am quite the android enthusiast. I have only used android smartphones and I have had the first galaxy tab from Samsung so I know a little about how the interface is and I know what irks me about the interface. Since I only got this today I can only give a preliminary review.\n\nI bought this device for school, mostly to carry my textbooks and read some book through Amazon's kindle app. It works brilliantly for that, the compactness makes it very easy to carry around. The battery life is adequate but from my usage of it, the battery seems to drain rather quickly. As I understand it, the battery in this second gen nexus 7 has a smaller battery than the first one, but that can be accounted for by the reduction in weight and the new nexus being slightly, but noticeably, smaller than its predecessor.\nThe display is what attracted me most to this device, but this could be its weakest point also. There is something about the display that makes Youtube and Netflix feel a little strange. It could be the aspect ratio but I'm not sure about that. Like almost every smartphone/tablet, this thing is a finger magnet. I don't think it's fair to rate this product down for that since almost every smartphone/tablet has that problem, so I won't rate it down because of that. The size of the display is wonderful if you're looking for something small and portable. The 10.1 inch display on my Galaxy Tab was a bit too big for me to carry around everywhere. This 7 inch display is perfect for my purposes and works like it should.\n\nI think this is one of those products that you should definitely try before you actually buy though. I am a android enthusiast so I have gotten used to the interface rather quickly. Other people who have used apple products or windows products may not like the interface as much, but I have gotten used to it. The interface is not without its flaws, but I'm sure developers will be coming out with new ROMs that will remedy the flaws. For this price point, it is difficult to find anything better. I have used Amazon's tablet before, but I personally prefer the Nexus to that. Kind of sucks that Amazon has prevented android users from using the Instant Video feature, but I'm sure work-a-rounds are already going to be coming out for this device in due time. If you're looking for a tablet to use for college and travel, this may be the tablet for you.\n\n**This review is for the WIFI only 32GB Second Generation Nexus 7. If you're looking for the LTE version, that will be coming out in a couple weeks for 350.\n\n**I know someone is going to bring up this issue so I'll address it before I post this review. The previous Nexus 7 did not have a microSD slot, so why are people complaining about that? You should have seen that coming, and for this price point it cannot be expected. If you need more space go for the 32GB like I did. And Also, the available space you can use for a 32GB is a little over 26 GB. This is probably due to some of the drive being used for the Android interface and some of it being taken from just being formatted. If you've ever formatted a computer you know exactly what I'm talking about.\n\nJuly 28, 2013 Update: Ok I got a lot more time to play with this tablet and I have seen a couple of problems. On occasion it will freeze up on me and then continue. I have a tendency of pushing my devices by downloading multiple apps and doing other things at the same time, but I find it weird how it still freezes with a quad core processor. The screen still irks me a little. Netflix doesn't look quite like it should, it feels a little strange to me. Also I have noticed something strange. My speaker has some static at lower volumes. At higher volumes I can't hear the static since whatever I am playing usually drowns it out. I don't know if this problem only lies with my nexus, but I am just reporting my experience. I may return my nexus if no new software updates remedy this within the next 30 days. It could be hardware, I don't know. It doesn't appear that anyone else has this problem.\n\nFor those who wanted to use this tablet as a player for your downloaded video, you probably will not be able to unless you convert your files. I have 720p mkv movies and tv shows and it does not appear that I am able to play any of them with audio and video. There are apps such as MX player or bs player that will enable me to look at the video, but there's not audio playing with it. I have heard about this happening around all Jelly Bean phones and since 4.3 just came out, it looks like an app update might be a long ways away. If I could, I would turn my rating to a 3.5 at this point, but Amazon doesn't allow for that, so I'll keep it at 4 stars for now."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "First to be clear I ended up not buying the new version after using it for a day. I do think the screen is better, not knock out better but can be seen. My problem is that there is still no SD card. Not having an SD card will keep me from buying any Tablet. I keep extra movies on it, and actually have a \"travel\" card that does not have all the apps I don't need while on vacation or traveling off of it, and more movies, and personal data that I do need plus more apps that would be used for traveling. The Cloud is just not a good substitute for such a device.\n\nYou can use a slimport for HDMI out but does require buying and having with you another adaptor, but at least it has it.\nIn reality, though not quite as good a screen, my Panasonic tablet, which also to an extent is waterproof, has all those features and more and for traveling is better for me, and my Daughter decided to keep her original version.\nIf the SD card is not important to you, this can be a very good tablet. As posted above in another review I do think it is faster than the original.\n\nNOTE - my review was modified to reflect the slimport."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I was a fan of the size and features of the original Nexus 7, so I stepped out to get one of the new models today. I wanted to see how the app and data synchronization works between two devices, and I'm likely going to gift the old one to my young daughter. Let's call the new device Nexus 7 (B) to differentiate it, since neither Google nor Asus has given it a new name.\n\nThe packaging is a nice slip-on gift box as you'd expect from this kind of device, with a splash of blue to differentiate it from Apple or Amazon tablets. First impressions as it comes out of the box are positive. Nexus 7 (B) is black-on-black-on-black: the power/volume buttons are black, the logos are black, the (slim, between the size of iPhone cube and iPad bricklet, very short cord) charger is black, the bezel is black, and the holes for the cameras (back and front, more on them later) are black. It's like, how much more black could this be? And the answer is none. None more black. (Apologies to Nigel Tufnel, but it's true).\n\nIt makes the \"old\" (2012) Nexus 7 look like a tacky cheese ball when placed side by side. The silvery painted-plastic trim on the old one (all nicked and pitted in my case) is not missed at all. The new device is slimmer and flatter (no curved back) than the original. The rubbery backing is smooth, not \"Steve McQueen Driving Gloves\" texture like the original, but still pleasant to the touch and solid feeling. The front is a fingerprint magnet as you'd expect, like any black glass screen, but you won't notice when the screen is on. There are pinholes for stereo speakers in the back, at either end of the device, which sound fine for their size (audiophiles will use headphones, I presume).\n\nNexus 7 (B) ships with Android 4.3 out of the box, with a few tiny service updates to make you reboot after assigning a Google profile to the device. The default start screen comes with Chrome, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, Hangouts, and the new-to-Nexus 7- Camera app in the bottom dock. A shortcut to Google Play (App Store) is on the first page, along with a folder for shortcuts to Google apps for music, books, movies, magazines, photos, G+ (Facebook wannabe), Keep (Evernote wannabe), calendar, Currents (news magazine), gallery (formerly known as Picasa), and People (contacts).\n\nGoogle Sync pulled my installed apps from their store, including additional data, upon first launch. Unlike Apple's iCloud backups, not everything is synchronized and backed up. I had to enter lots of third-party passwords to get going, and all my downloads in other folders were not carried over. If you live more or less exclusively in Google's world, they've taken care of you, but otherwise, you'll need to look after your own backups. I'll need to install Amazon's App Store and my Humble Bundle apps separately. No big deal, but be prepared for some file transfers if you think outside the Google box.\n\nThe screen is qualitatively \"nicer\" than the original Nexus screen, with blacks being more black and text looking as Retina (no pixels) as I could imagine. I haven't received the over-the-air update for 4.3 on my original unit, so I can't tell if subpixel rendering is better on the old screen, but side by side the new one is clearly superior. It's probably not enough of a difference to upgrade if you're happy with the current one, but after some time with the new screen, going back to the old one could be more noticeable. Think Retina iPad vs. iPad Mini (though the original Nexus screen resolution is better than iPad Mini in my opinion).\n\nWhat's missing, besides that nasty silver plastic bezel? The pogo pins (which allow for zero-friction placement on a horizontal dock, for charging and audio output) are gone. To make up for that loss, Nexus 7 (B) includes a rear-facing camera. Like many early mobile phone cameras, it's better than nothing but far inferior to what is possible. It looks to be about on par with the rear camera in the iPad 3, and shares the same megapixel count. There's no flash and the image is noisy, even in the preview screen. You're not buying this for the camera. There's also a low-quality camera in the front of the unit for videoconferencing with Google Hangouts. This time around, it's offset to the right the top center, so you can use it in landscape orientation.\n\nThere is no SD card support. Also unsupported: Adobe Flash, floppy disks, slide-out keyboard, removable battery. It's a wonderful, inexpensive personal handheld computer, not a genie that wants to grant every wish you might have. These \"limitations\" are fine with me.\n\nPerformance is super snappy, the way you want it to be. I'm always skeptical of judging how fast a computer system \"feels\" on first boot, before I've bogged it down with all my software and files. The technical benchmarks (which you can read elsewhere), particularly memory and input-output speeds, make me think that this snappiness will stay around, even once I've made this my own. Mobile Chrome, the slowest dog aspect of the original Nexus, is finally a pleasure to use here, just as it is on the desktop. Library apps like Kindle or Comixology respond instantly, without the heavy lag as felt on the old Nexus. Networking feels faster too, but that's probably because of the faster internal read-write workings. File copies over USB are terrible as always, you're generally better off using Dropbox plus Astro File Manager to move things around.\n\nOne of my favorite features of the Google Play store is their selection of video games. They have a lot of the same high-end, 3D-intensive titles as the Apple App Store, like Grand Theft Auto, Galaxy on Fire, and Riptide GP. All of these and more run perfectly on the Nexus 7 (B), as you'd expect, despite the absence of an Nvidia Tegra chip inside. Where the Google store shines is in the red-light district that Apple's App Store avoids: emulation. You can get an emulator for many different obsolete-but-classic home computers and video game consoles in the Google Play store. Playing Super Nintendo games with a glass touchscreen might not seem like fun, but you can add Bluetooth game controllers and keyboards to the Nexus to make it into many little computers in one. This feature is just as good on the Nexus 7 (B). DOSBox Turbo is showing that the CPU governor is in \"ondemand\" mode, which means better battery life for you but that I will need to wait for new software to enjoy TIE Fighter on the go. I am and edge case as far as that is concerned. Everything else seems to run very well, and the store software will likely be updated to optimize for this device.\n\nI really like this tablet. Compared to some of the competition, it's limited (not as many apps as Apple), but its nice little size and price make up for it. Almost all of the \"neutral\" web services that work everywhere, like Feedly, Kindle, Dropbox, Pocket, Facebook, Tumblr, Flipboard, and so on work just as well in Android as they do in iOS. The physical aspect is very pleasant, both to the eye and in the hand. The screen is top-notch, the store is excellent, and the price is right. Recommended."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "Okay, so I have one of these and on the surface, it has just about EVERYTHING going for it.  It's slim, powerful, has a higher res screen, better cameras (anything is better than what the Nexus 7 earlier versions had!) and a super slick feel.  But hold up, there is a beef and a significant one!  This cute little beast can die without warning and Google or Nexus will put you through the ringer to fix it.  What mine has done, MANY have also done, and the forums are full of dead-ended requests for help that Google can't or won't address.  Nexus will stonewall you too.  Gods forbid we actually get to USE the tablet for any time longer than its warranty!  If your tablet slips beyond its warranty period, and you have a problem with it, I suggest throwing it in the junk drawer and forgetting about it.  Both Google and Nexus won't help, and the forums don't have a solution.  Just what happened?\n\nWell, mine got bonked on its corner, and the next time I went to start it, it got stuck on the \"Google\" word and refused to go further.  No attempts to reboot worked either.  It just goes back to the Google screen.  To send it back for fixing would require $35 to Google, then an additional $100 + to assess the repair need.  That doesn't even factor in the actual repair!  In essence, my device is bricked with no option of recovery.  There are few things that annoy me more than a product that is designed such that once it fails, you can't do a thing with it. We need better options for handling issues like this!  Google and/or Nexus lost me as a cheerleader on this one.  I should be able to find an at least reasonable work around so that I can get my tablet up and running again and keep it running until features evolve enough that I want to get a new one.  How is it  bad thing to keep older Nexii working?  Once they go out of warranty, make it possible for us to fix them ourselves.  It keeps them out of landfills and helps our environment, since recycling them currently doesn't seem to be an option where I am.\n\n\"Planned obsolescence\" is a concept that corporations like because by planning for customers to buy products that are designed to fail within a certain period, thereby ensuring that the customer will be forced to come back and buy another version of the product.  I definitely think that's what's going on here, since the injury my tablet sustained (while out of warranty) was relatively small, and the failure is catastrophically fatal.  Sorry Google/Nexus.  I can't lend my support for a product that cost so much and crapped out so completely.  This is a device that is pretty on the surface, but one that will cost you dear to repair or replace far sooner than you should have to."}

That was a new experience as I had used screens with my previous two units, with no problems. I removed the screen, but the problem continued so I took it in for repair. Turns out the sensor in this third unit was proven faulty, and also affected the auto rotate screen function, and further, just highlighting for cut and paste became a real bother. Please note I do not blame the seller, as it may well have happened just on its own, as the unit is now several years old. I feel sure the seller was factual, and since these things do happen to electronics, I waited a long time before reviewing it.  (This review is about the unit, not the seller.)"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "When it comes to motherboards, Asus beats most competitors hands down. When it comes to tablets, they should never have gotten involved in the industry. For one, the Nexus is an extreme fire hazard. I had bought 4 of these for my family, and had to replace have the components within the first two weeks out of my pocket because ASUS skirted responsibility. Despite being sealed brand new in a box, one of the tablets was an obvious repair as it had a tech sticker pointing to what was bad which actually never was taken care of before it was resold. Lets start with the issues.\nThe first day of charging, one of the chargers cables burned my landlords rug. They all ran very hot. Two out of the 4 which had the normal UL approved stamp on them I was able to verify had changes made after the approval which would never have passed inspection. The cable was flimsy and shielding was cracked around the connectors. All 4 tablets had charging issues which was caused by the faulty micro USB port which was loos on every tablet. Very bad solder/welding jobs and extremely cheap. I bought $15 replacement's which was much better quality. The loose ports was a huge contributor to the charger and cables running hot.\nOne of the Tablets were DOA, which was a bad screen. They claim to test these units before shipping out. I seriously doubt that, because the screen that was bad was missing the flex cable, so how they tested it and OK'd it to ship, is a surprise to me.  After buying the $10 cable, the screen still was dead which was about another $125.00. Would of been $45, but unfortunately I don't have the equipment to separate the digitizer from the LCD display so was forced to buy the whole digitizer setup.\nOne unit kept shorting out which was due to improper shielding and allowed shorting with very little pressure to the screen.\nThen the unit with the crushed broken screen because I sat on it accidentally. (Oh wait, that is my fault isn't it? Guess I'll give them a half a star later, after they return my calls on the other issues)\nScrews missing in key parts. This was discovered after opening one for the first time. I gather the double stick tape they used to insulate the micro USB port they assumed was strong enough to keep the port in place. (NOT!)\nThe chargers themselves were poorly designed as I mentioned above. Two out of the 4 produced no power at all. I highly suggest getting a replacement charger for this unit if you plan buying one. Actually, the money you save buying one of these can go toward the parts your most likely going to need to actually charge one up. New adapter, new charging cable. Lets not even bother to discuss support. The chances of actually getting someone once you select tablet is almost the same chances of winning the lottery. Try emailing them, they respond were sorry, we didn't get your previous emails, please give the following information so we can assist you. The funny part here, it included my previous messages I had sent them that they just said they never got in the first place. And better yet, when they reply to complaints like the one I'm leaving here, they leave a phone number asking you to call them which goes to the same annoying system that goes to absolutely nothing other than a infinite hold. ASUS, if your not going to hire staff for your tablet support and leave us on hold, please at least invest in a cheap $50 elevator  music system. Listening to the same advertisement 2000 times over on how your tablets are the rave, makes one feel as if they just downed 30+ white castle cheeseburgers then take a ride on the gravatron at the amusement park.\nMy daughters unit she complained she couldn't get sound, even without the headset. That was due to the unit missing the headset jack. I see the price has doubled here. I spent $150 for each one when they came out, then about an additional $125 average in replacement parts per unit. I hope the rise in price was to fix the issues that came with the units. I'll say this, if this was my first ASUS product, I would never have gone near another of theirs ever. Even after all this chaos, I still bought several of their motherboards last year which my 10 year old daughter with my help, built her own and her brothers own I7 servers. As I said above, stay clear of their tablets. Their motherboards, their the best. After seeing these tablets and reviews, I suggest getting&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/RCA-Galileo-Pro-11-5-34-32GB-Tablet-with-Keyboard-Case-Android-6-0-BLACK-Touchscreen/dp/B01M21V2Y9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">RCA Galileo Pro 11.5\" 32GB Tablet with Keyboard Case Android 6.0 BLACK Touchscreen</a>&nbsp;These run great. I bought 4 of these and have had no issues. The few I talked with who complained of them being slow, was because they bought the cheapest micro SD card to increase ram. If you want speed and accuracy, you don't buy a $8 micro SD card. You buy a card that has great read/write speeds and doesn't corrupt your data.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-EVO-32GB-Class-10-Micro-SDHC-Card-with-Adapter-MB-MP32DA-AM/dp/B00IVPU786/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung EVO 32GB Class 10 Micro SDHC Card with Adapter (MB-MP32DA/AM)</a>&nbsp;Only a few dollars more, and that makes a huge difference. The ironic thing about this card, it was suggested by Amazon when I bought 10 security cameras, that this card was highly recommended yet would only allow me to buy 3. Go figure."}

The only thing I noticed is that always use genuine charger otherwise, your device will charge very slowly. Many users have reported this as a problem in device but no. The problem shall be with using 3rd party data cables or charger.\nThe battery of this device is very powerful. I have even downloaded the offline map in the Google Maps and is helping me while driving sometimes. Buy a flip cover for this device, it will protect the device a lot. The cover comes with sensor recognition too.\nOverall I am impressed with this device. I like watching Kodi in it since it gives good battery backup."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I purchased the 2013 Google Nexus 7 tablet refurbished in 2014.  After about 15 months of daily use, the tablet was not keeping its charge well.  So I purchased an Asus Zenpad 7c to replace it.  Both tablets are made by Asus, but the ZenPad tablet is not quite the quality of the Nexus 7.  And after about 10 months, I started having the same drop in battery time as the Nexus 7.  Just in time, I found a local place that replaces cell phone and tablet batteries.  For $48, I was able to get the battery replaced in my Nexus 7, so I have moved back to that tablet.  The Nexus 7 is faster, has a sharper display, and better cameras.  Here is a quick comparison:\n\nNexus 7 2013\n- 32 GB Storage\n- 2 GB RAM\n- Quad-Core Snapdragon Processor\n- Display Resolution: 1200x1920\n- 5.0 Mega-Pixel Rear Camera\n- 1.2 Mega-Pixel Forward Camera (Screen Side)\n- NO micro-SD slot\n- Stereo speakers (1 on each end for horizontal stereo sound)\n- Android (upgraded to version 6)\n- Paid: $190 Refurbished\n\nZenPad 7\n- 16 GB Storage\n- 1 GB RAM\n- Quad-Core Intel Atom Processor\n- Display Resolution: 1024 x 600\n- 2.0 Mega-Pixel Rear Camera\n- 0.3 Mega-Pixel Forward Camera (Screen Side)\n- micro-SD card slot\n- Stereo speakers (2 on top side)\n- Android (upgraded to version 5)\n- Paid: $87 New\n\nSo there are primarily 3 advantages of the ZenPad 7 over the Nexus 7:\n1. micro-SD Card Slot: Expands memory (I use a 32GB card that costs between $10 and $20) that can be used on other devices.\n2. Interface: Asus' ZenUI interface that runs on top of Android was much easier and flexible to use.  However, there are several interfaces that can be downloaded and installed on Andriod tablets.\n3. Price:  Currently you can get the ZenPad tablet on Amazon for about $77 NEW.  So you can buy 2-3 of these tablets versus a Nexus 7 tablet.  Since the Nexus 7 is no longer manufactured, a new Nexus 7 2013 32GB tablet goes for quite a high price.\n\nOverall, I like the Nexus 7 better, which is why I opted to have its battery replaced instead of the ZenPad.  However, I really liked having the 32GB micro-SD card slot on the ZenPad.  For the money, though, this Asus Zenpad 7 tablet is well worth it!  But if you can get a good deal on the Nexus 7, go for it.  There are micro-USB thumb drives that allow use of a micro-SD card.  I use that with my Nexus 7 tablet.\n\nI also wanted to note that my 1st tablet was the first Kindle Fire 7-inch tablet.  That tablet only had 8GB storage (way too small), and most of that was earmarked for Amazon media only.  This limited app and file storage quite a bit!  Newer Kindle Fire tablets offer more, but I understand that they still do not allow Google Play Store.  That is a major issue with me, as there are so many more apps available on the Google Play Store.  Those issues being the case, I will not purchase a Kindle Fire tablet until those limitations are lifted.  I can easily read my Kindle books on both the Zenpad and Nexus tablets, so no big deal there.\n\nEnjoy!"}

So I did a little reading and informed her that while the Kindle Fire was ok, the Nexus 7 would be ...better. (I was only slightly convinced at the time). She would not be swayed and the Kindle is now a part of her daily life, and I suppose she still likes it. I opted for the Nexus 7 2013 32g and a Minisuit bluetooth keyboard/protective case that acts as a stand... she and the daughter are both jealous but neither will admit it ;) I often cast a YouTube video onto the Visio TV and effectively take over the TV and before long requests on what to play next are flying at me like popcorn. But I digress. The Nexus 7 was my choice and I've watched helplessly as the Mrs. has struggled with her choice; while I am often encouraged to \"fix\" her Kindle, there is only so much I can do. I wish everyone could have had the Nexus 7 2013, I really do. The only way it could be better would be if I had gotten the cellular connectivity. I did not. Mine is wfi only but the hangouts dialer lets me make calls. Mostly to corporations that I prefer not to leave MY number with.\n  In the beginning, I kinda wanted a tablet - but didn't know much about them. My decision to go with this one was almost \"off the cuff\" except for that \"light reading\" I did upon my wife's suggestion for a Kindle Fire. Now that I have gotten used to this little fellow, I hate leaving it at home, but I have to travel lite when I work.\n  If anyone is undecided about making a purchase, I would like to tell you - I am very happy with mine. It fits in my back pocket when I need both hands, the battery life is totally cool and perfectly acceptable per the amount of use it gets. I've made it a habit to turn it on \"airplane mode\" when I'm at work, so it doesn't sit there and run itself down. I can run it down reading, shopping, researching, checking the weather... you get the picture. GET THE NEXUS"}

The only problem I had was that the touch system did not work well as delivered, and I was initially very disappointed.  However, the problem straightened out over time via automatic SW upgrades.  The first device died March 2016 shortly after the Marshmallow upgrade. Other people had similar problems.\n\nI then bought a Nexus 9, which is a sweet device, and I bought another Nexus 7 from Amazon as \"used like new.\"  It seems clear to me that the latter had been refurbished. There was an evergreen needle wedged in one corner of the back.  I was able to remove it and finish seating the cover properly.\n\nInitially, the unit had some crazy behavior from the touch screen.  I could touch on the left side of the screen and activate a link on the right side.  Over time that has been resolved by software updates, more or less as for my original new unit. The touch capability on my used unit is just okay, but otherwise it is a fine device.  It makes a great reader and a good backup for my main tablet, the Nexus 9.  Nexus 7 battery life is good; display quality is great.\n\nIf you buy one of these, you have a whole series of historical software updates to do, and they will probably have to be done sequentially."}

The battery does not seem to have degraded and I charge it just about every day, however  I rarely let it go below 60% before I charge it. I've been looking at newer tablets but I just can't justify spending the money when this still works so well.

I have about 100 apps loaded and I've only used about 50% of the storage, however I don't have many photos or a lot of music stored.

I just called ASUS Tech Support (888-678-3688).  They said I would need to send the device to ASUS, and since it is out of warranty, I would have to pay for the repair.  The repair estimate I was given was $201.25---i.e., more than the price I paid for a new tablet!!!!  What a Rip-Off!  Heed the negative reviews!"}

Was able to fix the touchscreen issues. However, to this day, I still get force closes and random reboots (even when using the tablet in a non-intensive manner). I experienced this on stock builds and after flashing many different ROMs that are well tested and reviewed to be more stable than the stock builds that Google pushes to the tablet. Might have received one of the faulty ones. Still an amazing tablet despite all the issues. One of the most used and most useful products that I have ever purchased.\n\nTOUCHSCREEN FIX\nWas able to fix my touchscreen by following this video:\nFix Nexus 7 Touch Screen Issues(easy hw fix)\n  by drHerrscher on youtube.\n\nJust as the poster of the video shows, you have to open up the tablet and tape something like cardboard or folded paper to the connectors so that they sandwich together with the backplate when it is closed. This prevents the connectors from moving over time. Apparently the loose connections cause the touchscreen issues. After applying the fix, I haven't had any noticeable issues with my tablet touchscreen."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "At first I thought that this Google/ASUS Nexus 7 2013 tablet was great especially for the discounted price I paid about 18 months ago, $160 vs $300 MSRP... Problem #1... USB port charging, degraded, slowed, and failed permanently... Oops, my fault because I often used the tablet while charging. Even though I used a right angle connector cable, eventually this stressed the USB connector enough to fail... ASUS wants $90 for the small board to fix this... But, for $13 get Anker 'hockey puck' wireless Qii charger... This worked fine for several months (tip.. Use Velcro to secure correct positioning...) After a while, Qii charging became a problem... I opened the case to find inferior design and manufacturing techniques... For example, the USB connector is mounted about 1/16 in from the edge of the case, allowing for a pivoting and wiggling which will cause a line to break and fail... (Compare this construction to the USB connector on a top name cellphone and you'll see the connector set back from the case edge providing two point support, rather than a one point pivot) ... While removing the back cover incorrectly the first time, I caused the corner to actually rip a little... Uh oh, bad choice of plastic....! Too soft...probably dimensionally unstable... Looking around inside, one will notice the Qii charger coil on the inside of the cover relies on springy contacts to touch and complete charging circuit to battery on the main unit.. There's not a wired connection.. Combine that with inferior plastic material being too soft and flexible, add a bit of corrosion perhaps, and you have an intermittent contact... Oh boy... This is nowhere near $300 quality... Wait...! What's going on with all the tapes over the connectors and corresponding foam rubber spacers on the cover ...? They secure the tiny male/female connector pairs joining various board level components using tape to hold them and spacer pressure too...  Time for research... Didn't take long to find YouTube's and Android forum entries addressing these shortcomings... Build up the spacers with cardboard and adhesive to restore pressure lost to failure of foam rubber compression.  With tablet reassembled my Qii charger works fine with three 2-1/2 lb dumbell weights pressing onto the tablet ( screen face down on folded cloth, apply Qii, load with weights )... Problem #2... As for the mysterious screen freezes, boot up freezes, lock screen freezes, brick States, etc... believe it or not merely tapping on the back probably will get the tablet motivated... Or squeeze it hard on the USB end, and it may cure the freeze problem for a while... You need to keep in mind that the connectors inside are literally falling apart at all times after the warranty period ends... Do not call ASUS or Google about these problems, they don't know, they won't admit, they don't care about this P.O.S.  However, you can learn to live with it... Indeed, you might consider picking one up for $100 as long as you can return for refund... Note that ASUS no longer manufactures Nexus....!"}

I was in the market for a low cost tablet, and the Nexus 7 topped many recommendation lists because of it's performance for the price you pay. It also received the OTA update to Marshmallow 6.0.1 so you'll have the latest version of Android. (I had no trouble updating it out of the box [I did do a complete system restore between each update as recommended] and recently installed the latest security patch with no adverse effects to the tablet.) I do recommend getting the 32Gb version as this does not have an expandable memory slot.\n\nUnfortunately not all is perfect. The tablet I received suffers from an apparently infamous grounding issue (in which sometimes a touch is not recognized when one isn't physically holding the tablet or if the tablet is in a case) which has been well documented online. As Amazon sold out of their stock shortly after I received my tablet (though it seems to be back in stock now) I decided to keep my unit and placed a piece of cardboard wrapped in foil behind the tablet when it's in a case and that seems to have lessened the issue (though it has not completely fixed it) for me.\n\nIf you're looking for a lower priced but not lower end tablet, do consider this version of the Nexus 7."}

Something about it was completely hosed.\n\nAmazon is usually very responsive for defective items, especially for Amazon Prime members, but would not automatically replace it. We have to send it back and have them receive it before issuing a refund and separately purchase the device again.

All was well until I got a notification to install the latest version of the Android OS. After the update, the tablet worked fine for about five minutes before freezing and rebooting - and then would not turn on at all. I followed all directions and the device was fully charged, but no longer functional. A web search revealed that the new Android OS update has been bricking Nexus 7 tablets left and right for months and Google is doing nothing about it. I'm in the process of getting a refund from Amazon and won't be buying another Google tablet. I'm not sure how well the tablet will work without the update, but buy at your own risk. I went with a Samsung tablet instead, and it works beautifully - even if it's a little slower than this model. I'd rather have a slightly slower tablet than a $200 paperweight. Never again, Google."}

Asus wanted $200 to fix it (more than a new one).  Google the problem and you will see it is a widespread issue experienced by hundreds.  Asus won't acknowledge the issue.  I ended up sending it in just to get the repair estimate and submitted that to American Express which automatically added a year to the warranty when I bought it.  I then used the claim money to buy parts on eBay and got it working again.  One month later it failed for another common issue.  The touch screen became jumpy and unresponsive.  Piece of junk I've wasted too much time on.  A shame because I really liked it at first.  My dealings with ASUS resulted in a complete loss of confidence with the company.  Although some of their products have good reviews (even this one, amazingly), I now avoid ASUS products completely because I'm not willing to roll the dice with them again.  If ASUS had acknowledged the problem, fixed defective units, and released a revision, it would have cost them a trivial amount of money.  It would have been the right thing to do.  Instead, they are writing off customers as a less expensive loss."}

Paired with a bluetooth keyboard (and maybe bluetooth headphones) and VPN/RDP/VNC software, it's a perfect work-anywhere solution.  The Snapdragon 600 holds its own, despite its age, in any application I've tried--game, productivity or video.  If you've ever used a Nexus 5, it's the best analogue I can point to, just with a bigger screen (and no cellular service), despite the 600/800 difference in processor.\n\nExternal batteries are helpful, but not strictly required.  I get 4-6 hours of screen-on runtime with battery left.  The biggest drawback is WiFi.  Subscribing to Sprint, I didn't have LTE connectivity as an option to go with the LTE model (wrong bands), so I've looked at the hotspot service, a physical hotspot or hunting down an available service provider.  It's the only real Achilles' Heel I can mention.  I guess you can add the bezels if you really need a second weakness.\n\nPut a glass screen protector and a solid case on it--kickstands are wonderful if you can secure one--and enjoy it.  Lollipop 5.1.1 runs like it was designed for it.  And if Google enables it for Fi, it becomes the Phablet to end all Phablets!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "Although the Nexus 7 is a good tablet, for the most part, I chose to buy this through Amazon Warehouse Deals, which was a big mistake on my part. For, there appears to be no way of knowing how long the remainder of the warranty is good for, or if it has any warranty at all. And, I know now more than ever that this is the risk you take with electronics. For, my Nexus 7 2013 edition died within the first year and there was no warranty left when I checked with Asus. So, although it was \"used like new,\" the \"used\" part is where you need to be concerned when purchasing from Amazon Warehouse Deals. For, you may get it a bit cheaper; but if it breaks soon thereafter, you will likely be out of luck and end up paying much more in the long run."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "(update 3, Apr  2016)\nAfter a year still loving this tablet. Playing an hour or two of games daily got me though the New England winter. It's best feature I find is the excellent sound from the speakers. I'm a fan of streaming radio 'Organ Live', and organ music sounds great on this tablet. Streaming radio will play in the background of games (two sound sources add) without the play of the game being affected. My earlier problem with the screen becoming unresponsive I am now sure is not a hardware problem. It is due to system resources becoming overloaded. A power down/up reset fixes the problem every time. The Nexus 7 case by JETech is great, highly recommended, flip it up and Nexus 7 suspends. My only annoyance is that the black sound buttons, which are exactly the same color as the case, are nearly invisible and hard to find even by feel.\n----------------------------------\n(update 2, Oct 2015)\n  The problem I was having with the screen not responding reliably to touch has pretty much faded away. I think the main problem is not physical, but the response time of the OS. When the screen starts to become not fully responsive, which happens regularly after using my tablet for navigation, I just power down/up, and it nearly always it fixes the problem.\n---------------------------\nScreen touch sensitivity problem (update)\n  I have had this tablet a month now and spent many hours playing games with it, but yesterday I gave up in disgust because the screen was responding so poorly to touch. Playing Candy Crush, Temple Run and Solitaire I often had to tap the screen 5 or 10 times to get it to respond. I have the exact same games on my 7\" Nook, also an android machine, and its screen is always responsive, and the games play smoothly. I'm an engineer and I've noticed that the Nexus screen sensitivity varies from day to day, like it's sensitive to humidity or temperature or finger oils or something. Sometimes it's as sensitive as the Nook and games play cleanly, but on other days the screen ignores repeated taps and swipes with some regions of the screen being particularly bad. I've found resetting the tablet doesn't help. This is a serious problem. I've lowered my rating to two stars. It appears that Nexus in pushing the screen to very high resolution has traded off it having a reliable, robust touch sensitivity.\n\nTips\nAt first power up the home screens on my new tablet were not clean. More than half the space of the center home screen was occupied by a \"My Library' box and the home screen to the right had a large \"Recommended for\" box. To me these are just annoyances. I have not figured out how to delete them, but there is a way to minimize them and move them out of the way. I don't see any discussion of this in a search of the reviews, so I thought I would write up how to do it.\n\nA long press on these boxes will eventually show an outline box. Play around this as it is a little tricky. The edges of the outline box can be dragged to make the boxes considerably smaller. But even better a long press on the minimized boxes will allow them to be moved to other home screens like any app icon. I moved them to the outer home screens giving me three clean center home screens for my icons.\n\nHow to hide the keyboard --- when I searched, all I found was recommendations to swipe the keyboard, but that doesn't work on my Nexus 7. What does work is hitting the left back arrow, which changes from pointing left to pointing down when the keyboard is on screen."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "In today's tech race, we've been led to believe that a 2 year old or even a 1 year old piece of tech is obsolete.  It's a lie in the marketing world known as planned obsolescence.  Do you remember a time when there were no \"new purchase insurance\"?  What happened to quality & value?  The secret is today, it's rare, but I'm constantly looking and when I find something, I want to share the info.  The internet is a great equalizer.  Credit marketers and today's economy for so much crap that we buy, the idea of planned obsolescence drives more purchases and the economy into spending more frequently.  The marketer's idea was sold to companies and now it's part of production.  If I bought a fridge and it lasts 10 years or more, it's not profitable.  It's a clear sign when I'm in the cashier line to pay, haven't even opened the box to the new product yet, and I'm offered the \"what if this breaks\" insurance.\nNot the Nexus 7 2013 32GB tablet.  This tablet is still, in my humble opinion, one of the best tablets to date. ASUS has won my trust.  They consistently make quality products with the consumer in mind.  I own the ASUS RT68AC Router, which was the first of it's kind to meet the needs of high tech streaming homes.  After this product, the rest of the competition followed suit. I also own ASUS laptops and switches in my home.  I'm rarely disappointed with an ASUS product.  The Nexus 7 screen is bright and vivid, it's still super snappy, the speakers give ample sound, and the 32gb version offers just enough space if you add cloud storage.  This tablet is worth your purchase, and you shouldn't need to compare specs because it works just like it should.  Plus you will be the first to get the latest updates from Google, since it's pure Android.  I've actually had this tablet for over 2 years, and I'm finally coming around to writing the review because it is necessary.  It's a winner."}

This is apparently what happened to mine. I woke up one Monday to discover it frozen at the Google logo (which appears during boot-up). It is impossible to get past that point. So far as I can tell, it had just upgraded itself to Lollipop 5.0.2, and froze when rebooting. At least, that's what many, many other people reported as the cause of the problem. I've tried every cure I could find on the Internet with no luck. And even worse, neither Google nor Asus will do anything about the problem unless it happens while you are still in warranty. Since I bought my tablet early after its release, I've had it about a year and a half now. When it works, it's very nice. My wife's still works, even upgraded to Lollipop 5.1.1. But mine seems forever stuck on the Google logo. Asus reportedly wants $200+ to fix the problem, and Google just says, \"Too bad,\" when they say anything--even though I bought both tablets directly from the Google Play Store. At present I'm awaiting a motherboard from China to replace the motherboard in the tablet, which seems to be the recommended solution. I'm hoping it will work, but if it doesn't I'll have to buy another tablet (NOT a Nexus this time)."}

ASUS told me they'd fix it... for $150 if it's a motherboard problem, and some unspecified amount if it's a software problem.\n\nDid I mention there's no way to hard reboot/factory reset the device if you can't get into the OS?\n\nSo, yeah...

Normally I don't care about the size of a device, but I fitted my Nexus 7 2013 into the stock nav-hood of my RX-8. Note for anyone who wants to do that: get the 2012 version. The 2013 is just slightly wider and it will make your life a whole lot harder.\n\nThe device itself works very well, if a little under-powered. For general use you'll never even notice."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "This tablet failed just after the 1 year warranty.  There is a known issue with the motherboards.  Asus would not stand behind their product and was charging $200 to replace the motherboard, though I can replace the motherboard for $40 in parts on my own.  I will never buy another asus product again.  My original iPad still works 5 years later.  Shame on asus for making a product that lasts for 1 year.  Oh and thanks for breaking the screen when it was there.  I will really enjoy replacing that while I am replacing the motherboard."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "DO NOT BUY!  Let me first start by saying that I am ordinarily a huge fan of both Asus and the Nexus product line -- and while it worked, I loved my 2013 Nexus 7 32GB tablet.  It became my main computing device for email, web surfing, media, etc.  HOWEVER - it died one month after the warranty expired.  Asus wants $200 to fix it because it is out of warranty!  Do an internet search on \"nexus 7 2013 won't boot\" - there are MANY, MANY people that have the 2013 model and had it die within a couple months after the warranty expired.  Asus seems to have a serious design or manufacturing flaw with this device - their earlier models don't seem to have this issue.  We also have a 32GB 2012 Nexus 7 that is still working just fine and my wife loves it. Seems like class action lawsuit material to me.  Also - if you get one of these, be sure to back up EVERYTHING.  I had GBs of content stored on the tablet that is now permanently lost."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "Let me start off by saying I love this tablet! My kids have Samsung tab 3 & 4...It blows the tab 3 out of the water and is faster and I prefer the keyboard setup to the tab 4. The nexus was my first tablet and it was love at first sight!\n\nBeautiful screen, nice battery life, fast switching between apps, lots of tabs open in the browser and it doesn't lag.\n\nI purchased this tablet in Oct 2013 by early March of 2015 the battery started overheating, not holding a charge and draining fast, the charging port started malfunctioning it got so bad it would no longer charge...I have used this tablet constantly up until the problems started\nI bought an extended warranty *square trade was worthless repairing it* they admitted to never repairing the charging port, the replacement battery still didn't hold a charge and they put a cheap screen on it, which had a dark spot in the corner, wavy unclear picture when scrolling text and pictures and other assorted issues...after a long drawn out battle I finally got a full refund.\n\nWhile the tablet worked it was awesome! I'm not sure what the life expectancy  should be so I took one star off for the battery and charging port issues.\n\nNow I'm stuck deciding if I should order another one and have to replace it again in 1 to 1 1/2 years since reading other reviews the battery and charging issues are a known problem. I was really hoping they would have a new version of this tablet since some games/apps won't work with this tablet (outdated hardware?) No matter what I choose as a replacement I would not recommend squaretrade for a warranty. They will not repair with comparable parts!! This isn't the first problem I've had with them I'll  no longer give them my business. I'll be giving canopy warranties a try now.\n\nConclusion- Great tablet while it works but not long lasting. Definitely worth having a warranty for the price. I'd buy another one in a heartbeat if they put a newer version out. Mainly for a fix on the charging port, battery, and newer hardware for being compatible with new apps and games that this model isn't compatible to play/use\n\nSo far my replacement considerations would be the nexus 8, Nvidia shield, If anyone has any input since all seem to have ups and downs I'd greatly appreciate it..."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "Bought this unit in August 2013.  Flash ahead 1 year 7 months later... this morning i open up my device to see this Google Screen.  I get to this screen of death where my only options are to try to reboot it or reset it.  I can get it to get to some sort a screen to pick one of 4 options.  Start and Recovery Mode takes me back to the same Google Screen. Power Off just turns it off.  Upon restarting it will take me back to this Google screen.  Restart Bootloader takes me back to these 4 options.  I contacted ASUS and similar to other people, they gave me a RMA.  Not sure at this point it's worth sending it back as it's out of warranty.  They said they will look at it once it's in their hands.  It could potentially cost $100 to fix; otherwise they will ship it back for free.  We'll see how this turns out.  I spent $269 for this device, and I don't think i will be purchasing another Nexus anytime soon.  At this point i don't know if it's an ASUS issue or a Google Lollipop OS update issue.  Many people on android forums seem to be blaming Google over Asus.  Maybe I will go try out a kindle device.  At least it's cheaper than the Nexus and you know Amazon will stand by it's product and you can easily get a hold of Amazon Customer Service.\n\nI called Google for support.  Forget about it.  Their response was if you had purchased it via our PLAY STORE, then we can help you. Since you bought it from Amazon, you need to deal with ASUS.  I asked for a supervisor, and they were all busy and they told me they would call me when one was available.  24 hours later, there still hasn't been a call."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "Great at what it is, and a great bargain.  This is my second Nexus 7, the first being the Gen 1 model.  I loved it so dearly I leapt on the chance to buy this upgraded model.  Sure, there are other tablets with bigger screens, better cameras, a few other niceties, but they cost more and those frills are of no interest to me.  I am disabled and spend most of my time in bed.  This is small and light enough I can easily hold it in one hand and plenty big enough to read mail, check out Web sites, and watch movies from Netflix.  It's plenty zippy enough and the display is 1920x1080, the perfect resolution for watching HD movies.  It's great for playing most games, too, though for some it is a little too big as it's hard to cover the whole screen with your thumbs.\n\nAs for the negatives, they aren't things I care about much.  The cameras are nothing special, but tablets make awkward cameras so I don't care.  The front camera is perfectly adequate for Skype.  If there is one feature I would like it is a MicroSD slot for expanding the storage.  I have way too much music to fit in the 32gb of built-in memory.  Still, no big deal, because at home I'm on WiFi, so downloading music I want to listen to is quick and easy.  Only when I'm away from home would it be nice to have.  Some competitors have this feature, but they are weaker in other respects or quite a bit more expensive.  This is a wonderful tablet for such a low price."}

I received my 2nd gen Nexus 7 (32gb) from them 2 days ago and have experienced 1 issue so far, the generic 2-port AC adapter which came with the Nexus 7 (not original) from Ocean Reef, overheated my device and would not power on for about 15 mins! This is surprising to me, but I realize I should probably buy the official charger from Asus to keep this problem from happening. Well getting back to it, first off the price had me sold, it was unbeatable and couldn't find it anywhere else for the money and Ocean Reef as a company had great reviews here on Amazon! As far as I can tell, there are only slight visual marks and scratches on the screen and very few of them at that! As soon as I turned it on I installed the Lollipop 5.0.2 update, which is a massive overhaul for Android and definitely makes the tablet more enjoyable to use!\nThis isn't my first 2nd gen Nexus 7, I really enjoy trying out different tablets from Samsung, Apple, Dell, Asus, Kindle, etc, you name the good ones and I've most likely tried them out (just a side hobby and learning curve). I'm a big fan of the Nexus line of tablets and am yet to try the Nexus 9, but for right now I really enjoy using the 2nd gen Nexus 7, 32gb, its just enough screen for short emails, movies on-the-go in HD, mobile gaming (Modern Combat, Dead Trigger, etc.) and writing reviews such as this one! It's quite inexpensive now as well, due to other tablets coming out with better specs and hardware, not to say that this doesn't do its justice, with 2gb of RAM, 1920x1080p resolution, a 1.5 GHZ Qualcomm processor, 9+ hours of battery and the latest, greatest Lollipop update, this is still considered (in my book) to be a great, fast and helpful tablet!\nI am pretty happy with my purchase of this Nexus 7 (2nd gen, 32gb) through Ocean Reef, the shipping was free and it came within 3 days of purchasing it! Again the only issue is the bad generic AC adapter it came with, I'm probably better off not using it (Giving it a 4-star rating)! Otherwise I look forward to getting the most out of my Nexus 7 2nd generation! Thanks!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I purchased this tablet a few weeks ago and it is the best tablet that I have owned. It is everything that I needed in a tablet. It has great color and vivid contrast. It has enough storage for me for a tablet and runs fast and quickly to open pages. I have several apps downloaded and it hasn't given me one hiccup  maybe if i decided to go crazy on how many apps that I install on it but reasonably it works well. One thing that I would advise anyone that has had an Android phone or Android tablet and have purchased or downloaded certain free android apps is that some android apps like Amazon App Store or Amazon Prime videos and others won't download to this Nexus tablet. There are several of the same apps from Amazon that you can get through Google Play but don't order this if you want to use your Amazon Prime on it because Google and Amazon are at odds after Amazon decided to only offer their prime videos on their Fire brand tablets. Not having the ability to instal memory to a SD card may be another thing to keep in mind but the 32 GB internal memory is quite a bit and works for me. There may be a way to backdoor the Amazon apps somehow but for the normal user you may want to stay clear if you are all gung ho on these apps that I mentioned or have spent tons of coin on your apps from Amazon."}

While I prefer the size of the screen of my 10-inch Samsung \"Google pad\", that particular unit has the unfortunate tendency to turn on and stay on if you bump it accidentally (plus, the 10 inch is not exactly pocket friendly).  As for this 7-inch device, having to hold the ON button down for a full 7 seconds before it will start can be annoying during regular use, but it is really nice to find that it hasn't turned itself on and run down the battery while still in your luggage.  Incidentally, I have found other uses for these useful devices, but I bought them both originally to have something portable to run Google Translate on.  Great travel app."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "Although long in the tooth by fast-changing design standards across the field of electronic devices, the Nexus 7 (2013 or FHD or ii version) is a real gem. The Google-ASUS partnership means that updates to the operating system are available soon after they are released. When received, the tablet is likely to be running some version of Android 4, but can easily be updated in steps right to Android 5 which is a more sophisticated and secure operating system than the earlier ones.  I highly recommend going to Settings and System Update at the earliest and getting Lollipop (Android 5) even if you have to go through incremental updates before you get it. It is worth it for the security and peace of mind that results. As others have commented, the speed of operation and high quality of the color screen as well as the easy-to-hold 7\" format make this a device that feels just as contemporary, this-minute, and up-to-date and any tablet currently on the market that runs on Android. An Ultra Slim case like the one by FYY is a great addition to the tablet--svelte but protective and allowing great access to all controls."}

Very nice screen, fast and smooth performance. The only drawback was a mediocre battery life. I actually purchased it a few weeks after its original release. However, after 16 months (December 2014) when performing the official Android 5 update the tablet could not boot. It froze in the Google logo. Recovery mode, fastboot mode could not make the table work again. So, even though out of warranty (it is 12 months) I sent it to Asus service. They recommended a motherboard change for a total cost of 200$ !!! As everyone may understand this price is unacceptable and close to the original price of the tablet ($269). Hence, my whole experience with this Asus nexus branded tablet is awful as I had high expectations from nexus branded products."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I've been using this tablet for the last 3 months and have been absolutely blown away from how reliable it is. In many ways it's replaced my quad core laptop and most of the time runs things more efficiently than my laptop can! There are many great reviews talking about this tablet so I won't go in-depth with what's already been said but I had a $500 Transformer Infinity tablet that was laggy, full of bugs, freezes, and would constantly restart itself regardless of what ROM I ran on it. I was very disappointed with ASUS and Android but after getting the Nexus 7 it ran every program and widget I ever tried on the Infinity all at once with no issues. It's never froze, crashed, or randomly restarted. Although a 10in tablet is great for YouTube and watching videos, for everything else (especially messaging) it's way too big while the Nexus 7 fits perfectly in the hand or in a pocket. The build quality looks nice but is cheap and plastic so I have a Poetic slim case on it which looks great and adds protection. Again the build quality is probably why some people have screen and battery issues, especially if it's been dropped without a case but as long as you take care of it as I have it runs better than many $500 tablets for less than half the price. The screen is super sharp, the stereo speakers are good although using good headphones with an EQ app is the way to go for the best experience. The biggest weak spot are the cameras which aren't that good but considering the previous Nexus 7 only had a front camera it is an improvement but I would like to see better cameras (8-10MP) in all tablets as I'm one of the few that does use tablets for their cameras, and again the Nexus 7's size doesn't make using it as a camera that odd. I've recently put Android Lollipop on it which runs great (5.0.1) and keeps this Nexus up to date along with the great internals which will keep this tablet relevant for years to come. If you don't have the money for the Nexus 9 or simply don't want a tablet that large the Nexus 7 is still a great performer, runs great, and with Lollipop still feels like it can hold its own among late 2014 tablets and probably even some tablets that we'll see in 2015."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "Good device, works great.  This looses two stars for some two main reasons.  First, the obvious, it is loaded with Google spyware, otherwise know as data collection from your personal information on the device.  You can turn off some of the collection, but not not all.  I will say this with Google store, it advices what information is collected by the apps you wish to install. Quite a few apps I refuse to install because they asked for information that had noting to do with the app (other then advertising). I can understand the ads as a way to make money, but why would a game need to know my contact's information?\n\nThe second issue is the lack of a SD card reader.  The whole point of a tablet is to be portable.  Now I have to carry other \"parts\" to read the SD card from my SLR camera.  Also, to save internal memory, any files I create or want to use on the Nexus needs to be stored in Google cloud to be useable (requiring WiFi access).  Not easy to save the files (books, movies or music) on an external memory.  This lack of a SD card reader slot is worth the removal of 2 stars by itself."}

I'm near sighted but my sister is visualy impaired and legally blind. The acessability option on this tablet is a joke, the font called \"huge\" is like barely normal size.

I am also now able to fairly assess this tablet after a few months' use.\n\nI wanted a highly-rated unrestricted (open) tablet that provided great graphics and sufficient screen space. I purchased this to use on a Wi-Fi network only for when I didn't want to boot up my laptop to check mail or see a movie, etc.  I also did not want an Apple tablet because my boyfriend has an iPad 3 and the Apple products have restrictions. I also was not impressed with the graphics on his iPad.  I was considering a Kindle Fire HD 7\" but that tablet was too restrictive as well and was geared to Amazon junkies. I am an Amazon junkie but I also do not like restrictions on products I purchase.  During my July 2014 research, I discovered that the Nexus 7 tablet was the highest rated Android next to those more restrictive tablets.\n\nAfter I received the Nexus, I wondered if I had made the right decision.  First, I was surprised that this came with no documentation (other than the business card sized diagram of where all the ports were and a warranty and safety agreement in both English and French).  The documentation didn't even say how long I needed to charge the unit.  I charged it overnight and then had immense trouble getting this connected.\n\nThe router I was connecting to has MAC filtering enabled so I needed the MAC address.  However, I couldn't get the MAC address without setting up the device. Also, I couldn't set it up because I couldn't get the MAC address.  I could have fussed with the router and turned off MAC filtering/security temporarily but I had to get to work in the morning right after the unit completed charging.  I then tried connecting via three other networks (my library for one, my work another, and another Wi-Fi connection).  It still would not connect. Because I didn't want to wait until I got home 12 hours later to fuss with my router I wound up asking a tech support person where I work. He connected me via his personal MiFi mobile hotspot.\n\nApparently, Google Nexus only connects to certain networks if the first time setup has not been done.  I tried several open networks. My co-worker's MiFi mobile network connection, although I suspect mine would have connected had I temporarily removed the security on my router, was the only one that would allow me to run the automatic setup so that I could connect.  After setup was performed, I was able to get the MAC address from the settings \"about\" tab.  I was also able to connect to the three other networks I tried previously and after inputting the MAC address, I could also connect to my router.  It was apparently the initial setup process that prevented the connection.\n\n This Google Nexus would have gotten five stars if they enhanced the user experience by:\n1 - Providing a MAC address either on the unit or on a piece of paper for those that have MAC filtering enabled.\n2 - Providing a documentation pamphlet with the unit that:\n* Tells the user how long they need to charge the unit the first time.\n* Explains to the user that setup cannot be run on all networks and sometimes they will get an error message.  Therefore, they might say something like \"using your own network is advisable\" or provide an explanation of why certain networks (including totally open ones that allow all connections) would not work.  Perhaps there is some sort of technical protocol that is not available on all networks; I have no idea.\n\nOther than the above, I absolutely love my Google Nexus.  I've been using this for almost 6 months and it has met my every expectation. It charges in less than four hours; lasts about 3 hours if I'm constantly using it; lasts about 3-4 days when I'm using it for about 10 minutes daily. I've used this for email, movies, web surfing, pictures, etc. App availability is unending (Kindle, LinkedIn, Battery Doctor, etc., etc.)  I tested the screen image next to my co-workers Kindle Fire HD 7\" and there is no discernible difference in quality or resolution.  Images and movies on this device are superb. If I attach my&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/APLWL-USB-2-0-A-to-Micro-B-Cable-6FT-TPE-jacket-Blue/dp/B00N4SIIFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">APLWL USB 2.0 A to Micro B Cable 6FT-TPE jacket-Blue</a>&nbsp;to my laptop, I can both charge the unit and also access files on it from my laptop such as the photos located under Nexus 7\\Internal storage\\DCIM\\Camera directory (that's Computer\\Nexus 7\\Internal storage\\DCIM\\Camera in Explorer).\n\nOverall this is a quality tablet that did not disappoint me once I got past the initial installation and lack of documentation headache. In the comments section of my review, I put links to Google documentation I found helpful as well as to the 2014 review I used for my research.\n\nUPDATE Jan 6, 2015 - Right after I wrote this review I had a problem where my Nexus was shutting down automatically and every time I went to use it I had to power it back up.  After doing an Internet search I was able to fix this by going to the Play Store app on the Nexus, then selecting \"My Apps\" and accepting all install updates.  There were a few updates that had not installed and this was playing havoc with my system. After I did this, the Nexus remained powered up and has been working fine the last several days."}

They might also claim that your internet connection must be weak, or that you're running too many apps.  Even if you have an identical device, which runs identical apps and works fine, they will avoid having to look at the damned thing.\n\nWhen you finally get the unit to them, they will send it back without really examining it.  Most likely, they will just perform a reset, which you have already done, so that it works for a while.  But you will still have the same damaged unit, as before, and it will eventually conk out again.\n\nAnd if you're unlucky enough to order from this distributor, don't even bother suggesting a refund.  They will simply ignore the request.\n\nGood device, but purchase it from distributors whom you can trust."}

I love it, it's a great size, fits comfortable in one hand, battery life is pretty good (about 1-2 days depending on how often I use it and what apps are running).  Apps are easy to install through the Google play store.  I wish the volume was a little louder though.  I use my tablet mostly for reading, playing a few games and surfing the net and it suits my needs."}

The screen is beautiful and the tablet is very easy to hold.  I have had no problems at all of any kind with it thus far.  I bought a rooCASE for it and it slips into my purse just fine so I can have it with me.  It is awesome for reading, and handles games well too.  The battery life is acceptable; so far I have charged it about every day and a half; or every day with heavy usage.  It was fun to customize (love the Android widgets) and set up. Don't hesitate to grab one of these things before they're all gone!"}

Something about the hardware/software was poorly designed, because it is constantly malfunctioning.\n\nUnfortunately, due to repeated hardware issues, I've cycled through 3 tablets in the last 6 months, and am about to need a new one yet again.\nI had originally bought the 2012 version, and after a year of use it stopped turning on. After a painstaking troubleshooting session with the ASUS online support (you have to manually press different buttons on the side and navigate a confusing boot menu in order to do a factory reset), it became clear I had to send in the tablet for servicing. The process, which entails submitting an \"RMA\", is long and tedious. From the day I shipped to getting the new one, I had to wait about 6 weeks.\nI finally get my new tablet.. and within 2 weeks of receiving it, it stops working. Once again, I try all sorts of troubleshooting but it won't get past the load screen. At this point I don't want to endure another servicing and decide to just buy the 2013 version, hoping all my troubles will go away.\nLo and behold, I encountered YET ANOTHER type of hardware issue within weeks of buying it - the tablet often and randomly restarts itself. At this point I don't know if I should just trash this piece of junk and buy an iPad mini or try to get it serviced yet again..\n\nTo recap: 3 different types of issues over the course of a few months, you have to really wonder about the quality of these tablets."}

I won't get real technical, just practical.\n\nThe size is \"just right\" for my hands. The screen is Fantastic!!! It's Bright, super sharp and just a pleasure to read on or even watch a movie. This tablet is fast, touch responsive and, being a Nexus, not a lot of bloat to deal with. Over the years I've used a couple other \"less expensive\" 7 or 8 in tablets and wasn't happy with the performance. Then I tried an 8.9 in that had good performance but it's just a little big. I also used a wonderful Transformer Prime with keyboard that is a great tablet semi-laptop but, for my uses now, I just wanted a smaller tablet good for catching up on the news and reading a few books. Surfing the web is quick on my home wireless. For reading pdfs (or books only in pdf format) print is a little small but that's Adobe Reader's fault, not the Nexus.\n\nI do root my Android products but mainly so I can freeze a little bloatware. I have Android 4.4.4 now but have the notice to go to Lollipop. I'm hesitant because I don't want to loose root.  I also run Go Launcher EX too. It doesn't slow this tablet down at all and everything I have tried works great; music player, photo editor, etc.  I even use the Nexus as a backup drive to make copies of photos when I'm on the road. With a simple OTG cable and a card reader (and the right app) it's great. I do wish I could use a micro SD with it, but with 32GB it really does have enough room. At one point I had about 1000 mp3s on it and about 400 pics (RAWs and jpegs) and had plenty of room left.\n\nThough the speakers face back, they're still pretty good. I'm pleased with them certainly for news video and even for music when I don't bother to get my earphones (Skull Candy buds: GREAT!!) out. Funny, with the case I use (folding front cover type) with the cover folded back in my hands it actually enhances the sound back forward.\n\nRecommended? You bet. Functionality wise, i's lots more than a Kindle or other e-reader. Size wise, much more manageable than the bigger tablets I've tried. I really do like and recommend this Nexus 7 (2013)"}

The only con is camera quality, but nobody buys a tablet to use it as a camera.\n\nI have a smartphone, desktop computer and this, so for me tablet is more like a leisure device, light browsing, random games and watching movies, which is where this thing shines. As said screen quality is astonishing for the price, you can really teel this where Google/Asus put their money.\n\nBuild quality feels solid (as with any Asus product), but over the time the plastic on the side might chip (I'm a dropper who really mistreats his devices) but without causing any real damage. Also, apparently is not that uncommon to get dead pixels (black or red spots on the screen), which don't guarantee you a replacement from Google unless it is too big or too centered. Mine got a red spot, but you can only see it against solid black backgrounds.\n\nIf you're looking for a cheap tablet this is for you, dead pixel and all I feel it is well worth the money spent if you just want it for casual use or even for children."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "Although the Nexus7 has received all sorts of plaudits in online reviews don't expect any help from ASUS if you get a problem with one. I have so far had two (the original unit and a store replacement) that didn't work properly (the first one the screen pixilated, the second one the charger connection didn't work).This was followed two repairs done by ASUS which have failed to solve problems with the microphone. I am now waiting for my 5th replacement/repair. The real problem, though, is with the terrible service from ASUS. I have received positively the worst service I have ever had with any product in my entire life - and I'm 69 years old. Hours on the basic service phone line, hours more to speak to a supervisor, a six-week long exchange of dozens of emails using ASUS's online \"escalation\" approach with someone who simply does not understand the English language. Repair turnaround times are advertised at 5 - 7 business days but actually take in excess of a month. The escalation process which promises responses within 48 hours takes 5 - 7 days to get a response and questions are never answered directly, if at all. Requests for my unit to be replaced with a new unit have been denied (not their policy). Even a request for a reconditioned replacement unit has been denied. I'd love to get my money back but that, of course, has been denied too. ASUS does not deserve to stay in business with this kind of customer aftercare. Unfortunately I am required to give a star rating before I can submit this review. Being unable to give it zero stars I reluctantly give it one star."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I purchased the Nexus 7 shortly after its launch in summer of 2013. I have already submitted the tablet once to ASUS for an RMA. While I like this tablet for what it is, myself and many other users have been plagued with a lot of issues that point to poor hardware quality and quality control. When the tablet isn't experiencing any problems, it's a great tablet.\n\nThe Good:\n- The IPS LED screen is nice. Good color, brightness, and viewing angles. The pixel density and resolution is great.\n- Lightweight plastic body, which cuts down on weight, making it less fatiguing to hold in your hands for long periods of time.\n- Qi charging compatible is neat.\n- Decent performance. As of this review, I have stock Android 5.0 running on the N7, and it's pretty smooth.\n- Attractive price, but you do get what you pay for...\n\nThe Bad:\n- Weird, unnecessarily wide top and bottom bezel. Considering there are no front-facing speakers nor capacitive buttons, this is a strange design choice that is a poor use of space.\n- Speakers, while stereo, are not great. Not surprising for a mobile device. But you would think that a tablet, with its larger space, would have speakers that perform considerably better than those on a mobile phone. The HTC One, while smaller, has comparable, if not better, speaker sound.\n- Cameras are so-so, but tablets never have decent cameras anyway. They'll do the job, just not very well.\n\nThe Ugly, experienced by myself and reported by many other users:\n- Touchscreen issues. My first N7 would simply not register any touches at random intervals. Even after receiving after my RMA, the touchscreen still has stints of unresponsiveness or erratic responses. This is most noticeable when playing games that simulate the use of analog sticks on-screen.\n- Backlight bleeding. YMMV with how much backlight bleeding you may get. Some units have it bad, some not so much. My first N7 had bleeding near the top edge. The unit I received after the RMA has very little.\n- Poor microUSB connection. Another reason I had to submit my N7 for an RMA. It would only be detected by my computer if I plugged it in just right, then it stopped being detected completely.\n- Random stuttering and freezing. My first N7 had this bad. Sometimes it was solved or at least improved with a custom kernel, but it was always there. The unit I received after the RMA hasn't frozen enough for me to notice, leading me to believe that it was a hardware issue before that has since been solved.\n\nTo be fair, many of the problems I experienced have been solved since receiving a new unit after an RMA. However, the fact that many users, myself included, have had to go through RMAs to get a problem-free tablet is troubling, and points to poor quality control. Without these issues, the N7 2013 is a great 7\" tablet. Just make sure you check yours for any of the above issues, and be prepared to exchange it or put in an RMA."}

Its performance specs and price made it a very easy choice. Pros: Battery life, display, android operating system, availability of accessories, system specs, size, weight, and best of all PRICE. This things a beast and easily outshines all other tablets in this price range as well as other more expensive tablets and has the feel of a much more expensive item. It doesn't feel cheap, the screen is very responsive, and the overall experience when using it is great. Its main drawback is that theres no SD card slot so you only get the internal memory (16 or 32).

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "i recently purchased the nexus 9 and was disappointed with the quality of the tablet. i returned it and as usual amazon proves to be the leader in customer service. so on the hunt i went for a tablet. i gave my dad my nexus 7 2013 about 6 months ago and he fell in love with it. i was playing with it a cpl days ago and realized how much i loved this device. so much so that i bought one for me (32gb) there is no other tablet in this size that can beat the quality, specs and value. it feels and fits so well in one hand. it is a solid tablet, nothing cheap or plastic-y here. simply holding it will impress you. the screen is bright and colors are rich and balanced. this screen is a true 1080 HD screen. snappy performance with a quad processor that handles multi tasking and games effortlessly. speakers are nice and have good sound. yes, the bezels on the top and bottom are thick but the first time you hold it in landscape mode, you will thank google for it. no worries about your thumbs being in the way. i thought bigger would be better but this size is great for travel. the trend seems to be bigger and bigger with these items but imho, this size fits my needs so well. on to value: in about 1 week this device will get the new 5.0 google os. so you'll have a 2015 (it's almost here) os before any other device. on top of that, you will be first in line to get any updates or bug fixes. as you look around, notice how many devices with higher prices are running 2 yr old android versions.  i suggest the 32 gb because apps have grown in size and they can fill up easily esp if you add music and movies. a 90 to 120 min  hd movie can take up 1 to 1.5 gb of storage. but if you can live with the 16gb, i will say its quite a steal also. pure clean android that you can build and trick out your way. you will not find another device with the quality build, screen, processor and cutting edge android software. im holding on to this gem until she gives out. (see screen shot of usable storage after unboxing and updating to 4.4.4 including a dozen app updates such as gmail, google music, maps, drive etc)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I read a LOT of reviews over the course of a few months before settling on which tablet to buy.  I finally broke down and decided to go with the Nexus 7, even though it did cost a little more than I'd planned to spend.  I have had the tablet for awhile now and have zero regrets.  It does everything I need and more. I've almost completely stopped using my nook Simple since getting the Nexus.  I originally thought I'd just use it for reading in bed at night. It didn't take long for that to expand to a trip to the in-laws and then the doctor's office and next thing I know it is going everywhere with me!  It fits nicely in my purse and just makes life so much easier when it comes to reading or playing games on the go.  I'm glad I let the Hubby talk me into getting the larger amount of memory.  Since this tablet doesn't have a USB slot for storing things to a memory card, it is pretty essential to consider that when selecting which tablet to purchase.  I also love that I didn't have to buy any new cords for charging!  It takes the same as my phone, and a few other devices we own.  I just can't say enough good things about this little tablet.

It's extremely portable, fitting in an inside suite jacket pocket, or even in a front pants pocket (though sitting down with it there would not be recommended).  You can hold it for over an hour in one hand with no fatigue. The screen is extremely high resolution, with a full HD screen packed into 7 inches.  You cannot distinguish pixels at all. It's just beautiful. The performance is very fast. There is really no lag at all with this tablet, even with a processor that's now 3 generations old.  The sound is excellent, with stereo speakers that had good loudness. The network connectivity is great. I easily get 50Mbs up and down on the Wi-Fi - More than enough to stream full HD video or load the most intricate web pages.  Being a Nexus, you get the latest Android updates directly from Google.  5.0 Lollipop will be out for it within the next week or two and Google will probably support it with Android upgrades for at least another year or more. I use mine for web surfing, YouTube, streaming video from my church when I'm traveling, Netflix, taking notes, reading, audio books, music, watching movies on the plane, games, stock trades, managing my bank account, buying stuff on Amazon, email, video chat, and more. Whatever you're looking to do, you can do it on this device. If you're looking for a compact, portable tablet, this one is highly recommended."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "Ive owned both generations of nexus 7s and I loved them both. Android seemed better out of the box w/ the first gen, but the 2nd gen caught up after a couple of fix's and Its lived up to my expectations every since. This has thinner bezels, a better glass , it feels smoother. This is gorilla glass2 , im not sure what the first gen was but I just like the way this feels. I do miss the way the back of the first gen felt, the dimpled almost leather feel but its no big deal. This gen is easier to hold, its lighter and it has the most vivid display ive seen on a 7 in tablet bar none. Every aspect of this tablet is better. It has stereo speakers instead of just one speaker, it has a rear camera. Taking scans w/ the first gen was impossible but this is smooth. The processor is snappy is they come and I haven't found a game I couldn't play. Its light enough to use this as an e reader but if you are one to read for hours, get a kindle for 80 bucks, it will suit you better and you won't worry about battery power.  speaking of battery power , the battery charges now when plugged in and using it, where as the first gen drained the battery if you used it while it was charging. There a lot ore accessories available for the second gen, it took a while to get a good choice of covers and folios and stuff like that when the first gen came out.  The volume buttons and power on buttons are still the same, very comfortable and easy to use and responsive. I was a first time android used w/ the first gen nexus and it took me about 2 weeks to get comfortable w/ it. well, id say about a week to get comfortable, 2 weeks to grasp the idea of it completely. Coming from windows a bit of a change but its a fun change and one that I haven't experienced since windows became the go to o/s back in the mid 90s. Overall , for the price, you will not find a better all around tablet experience. And for that matter, price being no concern you won't find a better one. The ipad mini w/ retina display is the nearest competitor for the second gen nexus 7 and even it only beats the nexus in one category in my opinion and that would be apps. Everyone knows apple has the apps down, esp the ones that work so well on the 7in platform but androids getting there and has came along way in a short short time. The future is very bright for this company so jump on board w/ them and see why they've sold so many of these tablets."}

I'm really glad I decided to purchase this tablet to give me a taste of the Android side of things, and I'm absolutely thrilled with it. In fact, I had the 2012 model I sold to purchase this 2013 model for the faster internals. I'll always be an Apple fan, but this is the best 7\" tablet you can get right now hands down. For the price, there's nothing out there with the features, clean design, and clean android. The only thing missing is MicroSD; you're stuck with the 32GB. However, I did get a flash drive to show up using an OTA USB cable - once. I'm working on that, I have a bad feeling I'll be rooting the tablet to get the usb functions I want. And I'm so looking forward to Android L - one reason I'm holding out on rooting or flashing for now.\n\nBasically, coming from the 'Apple Guy', if you're looking for a 7\" Android tablet, get this. Don't look any further - it's a winner."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I already had the previous version of the nexus 7 and I must say I loved it. The only con was the sound. It wasn't loud enough. So when the new version came out and supposedly had better speakers I decided to buy it.\nUpon receiving the tablet I noticed that the sound didn't work. I restarted the tablet and it worked. After a while, it stopped working again. I tried everything: restarting, factory resetting, etc... Everything the people from ASUS technical support advised. It was useless, the sound stopped working and the tablet sometimes restarted without reason.\nI finally decided to RMA the tablet. I sent it to ASUS, waited almost three weeks between shipping it to Texas, waiting for ASUS to fix it and then for ASUS to ship it back to me. I also had to spend a lot of money on shipping because I live outside the US, so I had to pay air shipping to the US twice. Once to send it, and another one to get it.\nFinally, the tablet arrived. I was so excited! Imagine my surprise when I unpacked it, turned it on and tested it. The sound stopped working after a few minutes. I contacted ASUS support and explained them the problem, again. All they offered was to RMA, again. I told them I wasn't going to send it back to the US a second time. I'm not spending any more money on it. And who guarantees the repair? Imagine sending the tablet a second time and not getting the problem fixed."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I had been using an iPad for a couple of years but was about to lose the company-supplied device when I retired.  There are many things I hated about the iPad and I dislike Apple for their totalitarian policies, so I decided to try the Nexus 7 because friends had recommended it.\n\nUnfortunately, there are also many things I hate about the Nexus 7.  Like the iPad, I spend half of my composing time editing the millions of mistakes I make because of the miserable touch screen.  Something I can fix on a Real Computer (TM) with little effort using a keyboard and mouse are a pain on the Nexus 7 (and iPad too).  It's also too small to use on my lap and almost too big to hold comfortably in one hand.  It should be either bigger or smaller.  I do like that I can stick it in my back pocket, but I almost never need to do that.\n\nAs a result of this disappointment, instead of buying a Samsung Galaxy 5 to replace the iPhone I was about to lose, I held my nose and bought another iPhone.  I figured I knew the iPhone and it's quirks well enough, so I decided to stick with the devil I knew.\n\nOther than the size issue, my complaint is really more of an indictment of tablets in general.  I've been using PCs for decades and I hate how my productivity plummets when using a tablet.  I would never try to write this review on the Nexus 7.  I just don't have an hour to spare for correcting typos.  They are useful for playing simple games, and are also useful when needing to access email, Facebook, and do simple web browsing in situations where a PC is not practical."}

I am disabled and spend a good bit of time bed-ridden so I use my tablet for streaming videos, listening to audio books & music, reading ebooks, playing puzzle games, surfing the web, emails, etc. The screen quality is \"out of this world!\". Photos, movies & TV shows are absolutely  GORGEOUS! I purchased a $12 cover that folds backwards into a stand which makes the tablet extremely convenient because it can be propped up in my lap, on a table or even against a pillow when I'm using it. Also, an angled cable for charging was a MUST for me since I use the tablet for very long periods of time and I tend to bump the cord when it's charging. I am about to purchase a wireless keyboard because I like a \"real\" keyboard when using Google Drive for documents, as well as an External Hard Drive for more memory so that I can throw my $600 Dell Inspiron Laptop in the trash where it has belonged since the 5th day out of the \"Dell 12-month warranty\". I am so impressed with the Nexus 7 Tablet that IF I ever purchase another laptop it will certainly be an Asus. I own an Ipod Touch 4th Gen & an Iphone 5, both were inherited from family members so I'm familiar with Apple products & Itunes and I've used a friend's Ipad so I can truthfully pass on that I have absolutely no regrets what so ever with my 2013 Nexus 7 Tablet by Asus with Android/Google Play.

Basically it just wouldn't power on or charge.  I tried all the various trouble-shooting that I found online.  Finally I called ASUS and had a case created for me.\n\nThey just emailed me and said there's damage to the motherboard, which isn't covered warranty, and it will cost $200 to fix it.  First of all, there isn't any external physical damage, so I don't understand how I could have done anything to damage the internal motherboard.  I feel that it's a faulty product, but they won't do anything to help me fix it, and they're trying to blame it on me instead.\n\nSo not only will they not fix it for me for free, they amount they want to charge me is pretty much the SAME amount as a brand new tablet!  If I had to buy a brand new one, I would NOT put my money towards another one of these, because it broke within one year of use.\n\nI would NOT recommend this product, because I feel they have horrible customer service, warranty, and billing procedures and policies.

For a tablet that was about $250, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who'd like a multipurpose tablet.\n\nThe one thing I noted however is that the 7'' screen is a little small for taking written notes.

While initially my impressions of this tablet were very good, unfortunately this product lacks in quality.  I'm currently on my 4th RMA with Asus in one year's time.  Three of these have been due to the micro USB port flaking out and intermittently not charging properly.  I've also had screen rotation issues, which I don't totally understand, but after sleeping/resuming sometimes the accelerator and gyroscope become unresponsive.  And as of writing today, the touchscreen has completed stopped working."}

From what we've read online, this problem is not uncommon, and very little support is available from Google or ASUS to help.  We've tried all the solutions we found online, and nothing...  I also have a Nexus 7, and the warranty expired on September 8, and what do you know, it is starting to act up.  It freezes and have to reboot, starting to have a mind of it's own when it starts program on its own, touch screen is not responsive... I just reset it, so we'll see what happens.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I would like to say I purchased the newest Google Nexus 7 tablet (2014 model)  on Feb 16 2014 as a birthday present for my daughter (Her birthday is in March). The product worked for about 3 months.  My daughter brought it to me to charge because the battery had fully died. I left it to charge overnight. The tablet never turned back on. All that happened was a blinking white light.  I tried using a different nexus charger I borrowed from my niece who also had a Nexus and nothing.  I finally went online and found out that several others also had this issue.  I tried contacting google and they stated I had to contact Amazon since I purchased it from them.  They were NO HELP. Person I spoke to on the phone stated I could return the item but there was no telling what my refund would be.  WHAT?!?!? I informed the person that my daughter had really enjoyed the product I just needed an exchange or for them to fix it, being that I had only purchased it a few months prior.  She just kept repeating herself that Amazon would return item but no telling what I would get back until they recieved it.  I tried speaking to google once again. The person I spoke with at Google also tried blaming me (or my daughter that is) for letting the tablet battery die all the way. He said you should never use the tablet until all the battery is gone. He also stated that if I sent it to their tech people to \"fix\" the problem it would be close to $200 ((WOW)) might as well buy the same product again (well actually I would never purchase a google product again). Not after this experience.  Needless to say I am VERY DISSAPOINTED that Google did not stand by their product and that Amazon could not assist me any further. To this day the tablet is just sitting there with the protective case that I also bought from Amazon to protect the tablet from any damage. ***Those of you thinking about buying this product please research the issue online about the tablet not turing back on once the battery has died completely and the blinking white light.***Silly of me thinking that once you plug in the charger it should ACTUALLY CHARGE the tablet."}

It's faster than the original, the battery lasts longer (even when using Google Now as the launcher), and it feels thinner and lighter.\n\nThe only two complaints I have are related to its arrival.\n\nFirst, the packaging.\nIt's like someone said \"How can we make the packaging SO disappointing that the buyer will question why they even bought this?\" I'm pretty sure this is actually Amazon's doing, but why I have no idea. Mine came in a plain (as in no markings at all save for a barcode label) brown cardboard box. I would have thought I was shipped a refurbished unit had I not seen \"new\" on the barcode label. Opening the box I was treated to the most underwhelming unboxing experience ever. Inside the tablet was secured to another piece of cardboard by way of a plastic sheet stretched over it. The charger was wound and secured with a twist tie in a separate compartment. That's it. No paperwork, no manual, no bags, no buzz, no excitement, no mystery.\n\nSecond, it arrived dead.\nI don't know about you, but every time I've purchased a device, it arrived with at least a little charge so you can turn it on and have that little sense of wonderment and joy. No joy here. In fact, trying to power it on resulted in 5 blinks of the notification light. After the plain box, I was sure this was a sign I had been screwed and shipped a DOA refirb. Googling the blinks didn't help, in the Nexus community there's actually an acronym for this: FBoD or Five Blinks of Death. In every case I encountered in forum after forum this mean the tablet was dead, until I finally found a single post that said this is how the Nexus reacts when you try to power it on but the battery is too low. SO... if you get one, and you get the FBOD out of the box, do what I did and just plug it in for 30 minutes.\n\nAfter the initial arrival, I haven't has a single problem. Love it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "This tablet is absolutely amazing.  I got this as a Christmas gift and have been using it every day since.  I have not had a single issue with it so far, and I have owned this for eight months.  Here are some comments on the basics:\n\nThe operating system:  Google Android version 4.4.4 KitKat\nThis system works fast, efficiently, and smoothly.  I am notified whenever the latest Android version is out and am able to update my system for free.\n\nMemory: Yes, this is a 32 GB, however the programs that come on the tablet take up some space, so you have 26.41 GB to work with.  It is definitely enough space for me, since I don't download any videos or movies.  I don't use my tablet to keep all of my music, either.  I really just use this for apps, surfing the web, some gaming.  If you are using your tablet for those things, this is more than enough space.  If you plan on keeping music and movies on it, though, I'd look for one with more space.\n\nScreen size:  7-inch.  The screen is a rectangle, making it really great for surfing the web in portrait position and viewing images, videos, and games in landscape mode.  At first, the extreme rectangle screen was a little hard to get used to because I had been using my mother's tablet, which was more of a square-shape.  Now that I am used to my tablet, I really do like it.  I have no complaints.\n\nScreen resolution:  The screen has a 19201200 pixel display (323 pixels per inch; 127 ppcm).  It can play video in HD, although I find that when on the YouTube app it has a difficult time playing HD.  Apps like Netflix play just fine with a great picture.  Everything looks great and crystal clear.\n\nWiFi Connectivity:  2.4 GHz & 5 GHz  This has the most complete WiFi connectivity, which makes large downloads a snap.\n\nCameras:  1.2-MP front-facing 720p video recording, 5.0-MP rear-facing f2.4 AF, 1080p video recording.  A big reason I got this tablet over the 2012 tablet is because of the dual cameras.  The cameras work just fine.  They are not that great, but the point of a tablet isn't to take professional photos and videos.  When the tablet is held completely still, some pictures actually turn out very nicely.  I was surprised.  The videos that can be taken are low-quality, but the mic picks up a lot of sound.  I did not buy this tablet for good quality pictures and videos, so I am happy with them.\n\nSpeakers: Stereo Speakers, 5.1 surround sound.  I watch Netflix, YouTube videos, listen to music, etc. on this tablet, and the sound is surprisingly good!  You don't get much bass action in the music, but that is what headphones are for.  You can't expect that from such small speakers.  I am very happy with the quality of the sound that comes out of those little things.\n\nInputs and Outputs: SlimPort and headphone jack.  The micro USB connector works great.  I have connected my tablet to my laptop, and have successfully transported files.  The headphone jack works well, too.  I have listened to music on headphones and on my stereo via an aux in cord.\n\nBattery Life:  I don't know the exact amount of battery life that I get, but I know that I get more than enough!  I use my tablet a lot throughout the day.  I mainly surf the web, play games on apps, and occasionally watch YouTube and Netflix videos.  I find that I can do whatever I want and how much of it I want in a day and the battery will be at about 50%, lower when I watch videos.  I charge my tablet every night to preserve battery life.  The battery will drain much faster with bluetooth and location on.  I keep both off unless I am using them.  I am very happy with the battery life.  Taking good care of the battery helps, so do some research on how to care for lithium ion batteries and how often you should be charging them.\n\nBottom line:  I am in love with this tablet and would recommend it to anyone seeking one out."}

I never ever had any problems with it till now over a year later hahaha... It keeps on freezing up in the middle of  doing something when it never did while running multiple apps on the background. Then eventually shuts downs automatically. The power battery icon shows up while charging, thou still has to be rebooted constantly. Its such a pain in the butt and to be honest I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I'm no expert or technician to diagnose why, what or how things happen the way the happen or what its causing this, why is acting like that? I do recall thou everything started with the new upgrade to Android 4.4.4. Then my headaches started along with it. Lol. I have been thinking bout upgrading to the new generation of Nexus 7, thou I'm a lil scared :( I don't know what to do.\n\n __Have anybody in here had the same problem with your tablet before? If so, how did you fix it?\nI had also heard that there is a Google Nexus 8 coming up soon. Oh goodness should I wait, then for how long.....???

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "Googles Nexus line of products has been full of great and excellent products. The Nexus 7 is no exception. With excellent power, long battery life, and its gorgeous screen, the Nexus 7 is the best tablet to get if you are looking for the perfect 7-inch tablet at a good price.\n\n-Design-\n\nAdmittedly, the design is not the most beautiful. It probably won't impress next to the likes of the iPad Air and even other Android devices such as those from Samsung. But while the design may be understated, it is not as ugly or as barren as an ancient barn. The plastic back is covered in soft material that feels like rubber, with good grip and a resistance to fingerprints. The nexus logo is placed with shiny plastic all along the middle. Even the box it came in organized and beautifully packaged. As for the front, there is nothing to be excited about, but its simplicity is still very much attractive. It is built solidly and there is no flex, twisting, or any cheap feeling material that would be normally found on low end Android devices. If I were to say what the weakest link of the device was, it would be the buttons on the side. They are a bit loose (at least with mine) and they aren't as sturdy as Id like them to be, but it still works great, even after 7 months of constant use and abuse.\n\n-Software-\n\nIf you have a Samsung or an HTC phone, then the layout will be different, albeit not that much. It comes with Android 4.4 KitKat, which is the most recent Android version available. It works similarly to other Android phones. Google Play Store is where you will get all of your apps and updates and all apps will be available to you. Apps run and will mostly be compatible with the device (Only apps exclusively available for phones won't run on it). It has software buttons instead of physical home buttons, which work perfectly well and it is completely customizable if you are the type of person who likes that. If you prefer the simplicity of iOS products, it can work that way too.\n\n-Performance-\n\nThe Nexus 7 uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Pro Quad-Core Processor running at 1.5 GHz with an Adreno 320 GPU. It also has a 1920 x 1200 screen, which is Retina quality screen. Its 323 ppi means that the screen looks beautiful. Text are paper clear and movies can be shown in full HD and with rich colors. The processor is not the fastest processor currently available, but it is powerful that you won't notice. Website is fully responsive with no lag whatsoever. Apps run smoothly and with no stutter ever. Games like Dead Trigger 2 and Asphalt 8 run smooth as silk and movies download swiftly and smoothly. The only time it will lag a bit is when there are a lot of apps open. But even then, the lag is barely noticeable. It can run everything flawlessly. Only drawback is that the storage space may not be enough for those who want everything on their tablet since it only comes with 32GB of internal storage, which is really only about 25GB of actual available storage. But for most people, this is more than enough. Battery life is also excellent, I go throughout 3 days when just browsing and reading without any intense things going on. Battery life should be impressive even under pressure.\n\n-Quality-\n\nIve owned this tablet for 8 months now and it has dropped a couple of times. Out of these times, the corners cracked and the black frame around the screen has come apart. But the screen cracked after too many drops, even with a case on it. Warrenty covered the damage, so that was good. But if you are really careful or get a tough case for it, then the Nexus 7 should have no problem in the reliability department.\n\n-Perks-\n\nThis being a Google product, it is supported by them with the latest updates available as soon as they are released. Those who have any other manufacturer's devices usually lag a bit from getting a new software update. Some may wait from anywhere from a month to even a year or in some cases never. The new Android 5.0 promises improvements and new features and having a Nexus device makes you the first one to use the new updates. Being made by Google also means it supports almost all applications without fail. It is also currently the best balance between price and performance.\n\n-Competition-\n\nCurrently, there are a few options but there are reasons not to take them. An iPad Mini (Non Retina) is $299 and is currently the cheapest way of getting into the Apple ecosystem. It is a good tablet in its own right, but it is $30 more and comes with less space (16GB vs 32GB). A 32GB option is not available for the normal iPad Mini, so the price would be $499 for the equivalent 32GB Nexus 7 ($269.99) A Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is tempting, but too slow and not worth the $20 saved. The LG G Pad 10.1 is good for those who want a bigger screen and same responsiveness, but the screen is too blurry. The REAL contender is the NVIDIA Shield Tablet. At $299, it is a bit more expensive and comes with less storage. However, the screen is bigger and it personally looks better to me. However, the real feature that threatens the Nexus 7 is the processor. Its called the Tegra K1, which is an EXTREMELY powerful chip that has a huge performance gap over the Nexus 7. And although it will update later than the Nexus 7, NVIDIA has had a reputation of updating quick, so it shouldnt be a problem. These two are good solid choices.\n\n-Conclusion-\nThe Nexus 7 isn't perfect. It couldve been more attractive and it couldve been built to stand out more. But for the price, the performance, and the support, the Nexus 7 is the best, if not the perfect tablet on the market."}

When there is no wi-fi, there is plenty of storage (I got the 32 GB) for books and music.  Even though the model I bought doesn't have 3G/4G, it is easy to save maps in Google Maps and then use it to navigate even when you no longer have a wifi connection.  Battery life is good.  I have not had any problems with crashes or other issues.  The screen is beautiful and reading is easy.  (I can't report about video playback - I usually use it to read and listen to music.)

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "In short, a good tablet whilst it works but good luck to you if there is a hardware issue.\n\nMy son and I shared this device from Singapore contently for the last 11 months until I had issues hooking it up for a charge.  Until then it was strong alternative to more popular tablet brands.\n\nIt's been over three weeks now since I handed it into ASUS to repair and I'm still to get a confirmed date for when the device will be repaired.  So far I've only been told that the motherboard needs to be replaced and that my device needs to get wiped and so lose all my paid apps and my son loses all the levels he'd worked up to.  With this consequence in mind I've asked multiple times for a one for one replacement - to no reply either.  Calls to the support centre are pretty fruitless with promises to \"escalate to HQ for an outcome but sorry there is not ETA\".\n\nIn this interim period I've refreshed my Apple iPad 2 which I have had for MANY years and it still charges and works well.  I also recall handing in a ipod to Apple Support and it being repaired comparatively promptly."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "The tablet generally works but both the hardware and software are flaky and service is abominable. I had 2 hardware problems (loose charging port and flickering auto-brightness) under warranty. Asus makes it hard to figure out where to send it for service, and once I did, it was gone for 25 days -- unacceptable service in this day and age -- and even worse, the problems remained when they returned it. So now I have to send it again. Obviously, this won't work if you really need a tablet. Furthermore, Google's \"automatic backup\" software setting doesn't actually back up anything except your address book -- not settings, apps, app settings, app data, screen & folder layout, etc. I'm not impressed."}

The battery life is good, the size is perfect and it is light weight. I use many of Google products and it integrates really well with all those products especially with Google voice for messages.\n\nI have two on going problems that I don't think are common for the Nexus 7. First the auto rotate feature from time to time will get stuck in the portrait mode. Usually turning it off and on (sometimes repeatedly) will unstick it. It seems to be a software rather than a hardware problem. But whatever it is annoying. It didn't start happening until it was about 6 months old. Mine is a year old now.\n\nThe second problem is occasionally the touch screen will get a little slow to respond. I find this problem to be minor and about the same as other devices I have such as my iPad and my phone. The touch screen problem takes care of it self after a few minutes but the auto rotate problem is more annoying.\n\nI would still buy the Nexus 7 again. When you consider the features for the price I think it is a very good choice."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I have a first generation Nexus 7.  I moved up to it from an iPod Touch.  I preordered it the day after it was announced based on all the glowing reviews so I probably have one of the first devices shipped.  I was really pleased with it, delighted in fact.  It was fast, and responsive, a great little tablet.  I was recommending it to everyone.\n\nThen they updated the OS from \"Jelly Bean\" to \"Kit Kat.\"  Kit Kat, that silly moniker should have been a clue of what was to come.  The OS update to 4.4.1 totally destroyed the tablet.  After a short time another update to 4.4.2 didn't help at all.  Everything is now incredibly slow and unresponsive.  Every app begins with a pause, followed by a delay.  If I try to do things too quickly, it crashes.  The Chrome browser is excruciatingly slow.  It pretty much just ignores you.  They keep adding ridiculous and useless features to it.  For example, if you close a tab, a banner opens to say you just closed a tab.  Using this thing has become an exercise in frustration tolerance.\n\nWhat is also irritating me is Google's total silence on the issue.  There is some rather complicated fixes that will revert the Gen1 devices back to the previous OS.  It involves factory resetting and rooting around in the bowels of the thing that seems a bit risky to me.  I don't understand why it is our problem to fix this issue and not Google's.\n\nApparently the later models (Gen2) work fine with the new OS. I am not ready to say that Google purposely sabotaged this thing as a ploy to get people to buy new ones.  Frankly, I will never buy another one based on this experience.  I would never recommend the tablet to anyone ever again.  If my experience is anything to go by, I would be vary wary of any future OS updates.  There is another update now that I am refusing to install.  Reports indicate that the devices lose all wifi with this update.  See what I mean?\n\nI am also disappointed with Android apps in general.  Most seem mediocre at best.  For example, there is no decent tide app available, at least nothing to compare to iOS.  Very few seem to have paid versions to eliminate the ads, and the ads are pretty cheesy.  I simply refuse to sit through a video ad in order to play a game of spider solitaire.\n\nAnother problem with Android apps is an apparent compulsion to keep updating them unnecessarily by the developers.  They take a good app and mess with it until it becomes unusable.  They destroyed the Google+ app to the point I just quit visiting.  I don't know what Evernote just did, but they have rendered it useless and a waste of time.  You can't even open it any more.  It just saves everything to the default notebook, whether you want that or not.  Twitter's app has also been pretty much ruined by the automatic refreshing.  If you open a tweet, look at a photo or follow a link, the thing automatically refreshes your stream.  Then you must scroll, scroll, scroll to find where you left off.  It's just a total pain to use now.  I tried other Twitter clients, but none where any good.\n\nNow I am just waiting for the new iPad Minis to come out.  Then I am going to see how far I can Frisbee this thing into the bay."}

I will be contacting customer support.\n\nConclusion: If this is the best bang for your buck then stay away from these devices or just mail your $300.00 to Asus/google tell them to keep the device, your basically giving it to them anyway. I have never givin' such a terrible review, however, I expected A LOT BETTER BUILT PRODUCT for the money. Now I know how Asus/Google make a profit every quarter. The only reason I gave it two stars is because WHEN it works, it is great !\n\nUPDATE !!! 8/28/14\n  I called customer service, I was treated in a professional manner, as expected...they took my info, had me send it on to Texas, via my treat. Package arrived in Texas within 3 days. I waited two weeks for them to notify me that the package was either on the way or not their problem. A few days later I came home from work to find a package sitting on the porch of my house which is on a very busy NOISY street...I opened it to find a nexus. I was shocked they would 1)Not notify me that it is coming so I could expect it...2) had it dropped off at the porch like that. I live on a corner of two busy streets, I know, sucks to be me. I guess I should be thankful that I received it at all, huh ???. Thanks NEXUS !!! It is a new unit with my existing charger and cable. Everything I had is lost (that part is my fault)...Anyway, I have a feeling this device will be \"non-usable\" within six months so for now I will enjoy it, because as I said WHEN it works it's great ! You may want to purchase EXTRA insurance because it's a matter of time. On a scale of 1 to 5 stars...customer service at this time gets a (3). Not a strong 3 mind you."}

Given the fact that Barnes and Noble does not have a decent solution for this systemic issue (a lot of people are experiencing the same issue), I decided to trash the Nook HD and get something to replace it.  I am so glad that I chose the Nexus 7.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "The Nexus 7 (Kit Kat) is a well rounded device that does most things well, a jack of all trades and master of none. I primarily purchased this device for app development and reading PDF files while traveling.\n\nThe fit and finish are good and I prefer the grippy plastic back to the metal back of the iPad mini.  Aesthetically it is a nice device. The only minor issue I have is with finding the power button by feel and it seems that the sound rocker works the opposite to what I expect. No real issues here. As far as operating systems go I personally prefer Kit Kat to iOS at the moment, but it  is a personal choice.  Android also has a good range of apps.\n\nThe automatic brightness setting/ambient light sensor is really annoying. It starts out fine, but within a second or so of use it dims or brightens.  It is getting more noticeable the longer I have the tablet. This is just not nice and distracts from what is otherwise a capable device.  I find myself constantly having to adjust the brightness setting manually. Not good.  I've never had this problem on an iPad.  I sincerely hope this is a software problem that can be fixed and not a hardware problem, but I suspect ASUS went cheap on the light sensor. At the moment I'm leaning towards a software problem as there is no light variation when I turn off automatic light settings. The sensor also seems to work correctly when presented with light and dark scenarios.\n\nInitially I was very disappointed with the Nexus 7 as a PDF reader and I kept wanting to grab an iPad mini retina because the form factor seemed to be better for this purpose. However, I discovered that acrobat has a text reflow mode that formats PDFs more like e-books. It works on a limited number of PDFs but helps. The Nexus 7 is easier to palm with one hand in portrait than the retina iPad mini, which makes it a good e-reader. Reflection is a problem so if this is your primary use then it may be better to get a purpose built e-reader.\n\nWhat is up with LTE?  I wanted to purchase an LTE device for use domestically and internationally, but there are two versions one for the US and another for everywhere else.  Come on Google and Asus,  Apple has a device that is capable of supporting both domestic and international LTE.  For business use this is important to me. I want one device I can stick various data sims in without needing multiple devices.\n\nOverall this is a good device, which is let down by the ambient light sensor and lack of genuine LTE support."}

Its the perfect size fits easily in my scrub pocket at work even with a case on. It is noticable that i have it there and i can feel it there but its not a heavy feeling at all. Best part is working in a Pediatric facility if i have a child who is crying or sad i set it up on netflix and half an episode of Yo Gaba Gaba later i have a smiling child while i do their treatment. The screen is perfect very bright and vivid and i love the fusion of google within the system i ask a lot of random questions to google and it works perfect. Speakers on either side of the tablet are loud and have very good sound. The price is great as well @ 200 bucks you get all the features of an inch or two taller Ipad but with even more features it cant be beat.

Overall, extremely satisfied with the product.\n\nHardware specs are good enough to run everything I've thrown at it so far. Screen looks amazing for media.\n\nI opted for the 32gb version and I'm glad I did. If I would have gone with the 16gb I would have run out of space quickly. As it stands I'm at about 20gb of storage. Extra space is worth the extra cost.\n\nBiggest selling point at least for me is the steady updates from google and the quick support. This is why I chose a nexus over the other android tablets out there. My biggest problem with the android ecosystem is the spotty update records of non nexus products. I have piece of mind on this purchase that I'm somewhat future-proofed for the next few cycles and I won't have to buy a new tablet just to get an is upgrade.\n\nIt isn't a laptop replacement, but that wasn't what I was looking for. I mainly use it for web browsing/email while traveling and media streaming/consumption. It can do minor office tasks but isn't suited for long term word processing or spreadsheets without a keyboard attachment. Even then I'd prefer a larger screen."}

I read my ebooks, surf the web and reply my email with ease and comfort. I really can't find anything wrong with it, battery life also is pretty impressive. I read some complaints about the battery being insufficient for an average day's use but I think it was due to older versions of Android; with KitKat, I enjoy a full day's use and more.\n\nSamsung launched their Tab S, a thing of beauty in terms of design and display. But I do not see a need to get that nor do I plan to. First of all, the price difference is too great and second of all, I've had bad experiences with Samsung with their bad support for their older models.

It was impossible to charge and impossible to add files from my computer.\nI looked it up and many many people had this problem.  I found out that it cost one hundred dollars to repair.  If that wasn't bad enough, so many people had this problem that I could not trust it not to happen again if I had it repaired.  It was purchased in April of 2013 and conked out in June 2014. Needless to say, I did not replace it with another Nexus.  I made sure that they will never get my business again, even though I have a Nexus computer and a Nexus laptop.  Brand loyalty means nothing to these people.  Do not buy this product.  If you don't believe me, just google it and see how many people have had this problem"}

The high resolution screen (1920x1200) really is great and has a very wide viewing angle. I can watch music videos for hours and the battery indicator barley moves.\n\nThe only short coming is the built in 32GB memory. My previous tablet had an SD card for the 32GB memory and you got to use the entire 32 GB memory for your personal use where as the built in 32GB memory allows the Nexus to use about 6GB of the 32 GB memory for system operation thus leaving you around 26 GB for personal use.  Other wise it is a great tablet - Well worth the price.\n\nWhen watching streaming video over WiFi the unit works well. When you try to watch streaming WiFi video and connect the audio to external speakers with blue tooth the Nexus cant't keep up and stops ever 15 or 20 seconds to re-buffer. I doesn't seem to be able to handle streaming WiFi video and blue tooth audio at the same time. If you connect the audio by cable every thing works fine. This is still a great tablet with all the other things it can do."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I originally wrote a very bad review and gave it one star out of extreme frustration. I edited that review to this. I also contacted the seller and I was not that pleasant. The seller wrote back in awesome time and I could have gotten things sorted out but now there is no need to. What had happened was I had called my isp twice yesterday and everything was online except for my tablet. I thought it was because of the date and time on the tablet which was wrong. When my isp couldn't help me get that online, and after googling, and after going into my computer to see if something was blocking access for the Nexus, I was ready to throw it out the window. I'm sure other people have been in my position with being frustrated over technology, but I thought I was doing everything to get the thing online. Today, it still wasn't online so I went into my router settings, which my isp should have about when they told me to reset my modem last night. I saw that it had firewall enabled and then when I went to another page and saw the pppoe username and pw (can't remember right now if that's the correct label, but I'm lucky I can even write this after wasting a whole day with the isp and on my own trying to fix things when I'm no expert. lol) and saw it was not what was supposed to be there. I corrected that and then VOILA! Nexus was doing EXACTLY what I had watched on youtube and displayed BRILLIANT colors and, not to be too dramatic..lol.. LIGHTENING fast speed! I even got my hola unblocker on there and was watching coronation street on the british itv player using hola unblocker. I took a couple of pictures and I am impressed. I'm not an expert in camera but I loved the quality of my pics. I installed some apps, but still trying to figure out how to get adobe flash on there, despite the directions I had seen posted in various forums. Nexus is lightweight, and it's easy to handle. I have rheumatoid arthritis, so my manual dexterity is a bit slipshod at the best of times. I'm charging it right now even though I wanted to continue to explore on it. I bought a Poetic slim casing for it.. actually I made the mistake of buying two, but I'll keep the spare one in case, because I did see reviews somewhere saying they will get damaged at some point. Not sure if that will happen with me though, I will wait and see. Oh and I watched WWE Main Event this morning as well and it was better than watching it on my tv through my computer. I can't see anything wrong with the graphics at all. I'm totally impressed with this gizmo and now I'm spoiled. I'm sure I'll be fighting with my husband to watch things on it. I should have ordered a slimport at the same time, but I can still do that. I'm also totally impressed with the quick response and the patience the seller had with me and highly recommend them. I would DEFINITELY recommend Nexus 7 2nd generation to a first time tablet user such as myself, but hopefully they will be less insane than I was when I was trying to get online with it. lol..."}

And my #1 favorite feature is the OS. Oh man, I love vanilla Android. I've had a Galaxy S3 for about 1.5 years and I hate TouchWiz and I hate what Samsung has done to Android.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "After ten months of use my Nexus 7 FHD quit workingblank screenkaput. It was still under warranty but Asus would not honor it because I could not give them the serial number, which is supposedly on the long ago discarded box as well as on the inside of the device. Opening the device voids the warranty. One customer service representative gave the okay to honor the warranty once I sent in my receipt of purchase, which I did, and was rewarded with a no warranty coverage due to no serial number. They said an RMA number would be generated.\n\nWhen I called I was again told there would be a charge. The customer service representative refused to let me speak with their manager or anyone else for that matter. I was chastised for not keeping the box. I don't know if the serial number was on or in the box, or not, but perhaps if it was, they should have placarded it: Do Not Throw Away Your Empty Box For One Year!  You Will Need It When The Product Fails!  As if were all supposed to save the empty packaging from every purchase when the receipt should be sufficient.\n\nSo, awaiting a charge to repair my much needed Nexus for, what is in my opinion, an expensive device that should have lasted more than ten months as well as honored by the warranty by my proof of purchase, I have been trading their delaying-tactics emails awaiting them to generate an RMA number to send in the device. It has been a month since this began and I still have neither an RMA number nor a repair station address to send it to. I get the feeling they are deliberately dragging their feet until the warranty year expires because once they open it the serial number will stare them in the face.\nAt this point I just want the thing fixed. I should not have to run out and buy another like a disposable butane lighter.\n\nWhen the device was working I came to depend on it for my business as well as for my work as an aviator. I enjoyed the recreational benefits as well, and fully expected Asus to keep their written word agreement, which has turned out to be worthless. I should not have to buy two devices in order to have a backup when one fails. I suspect that the Nexus is normally a quality electronic device and that I got a lemon, but I don't know. If the Asus Nexus is built with low quality parts, then the price should be a lot less, since their customer service is poor, their warranty is weak, and their product reliability is inferior.\n\nMy recommendation is to not buy Asus products without purchasing a good insurance program from an outside source."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "The Good: Sleek and light, gorgeous high-res screen, fantastic 5.1 surround sound speakers, ultra fast and zippy, addition is rear camera is nice\n\nThe Bad: Cameras are a bit lacking, no expandable media option\n\nThe Nexus 7 was the best 7 inch tablet on the market at its time. With the powerful Tegra 3 chipset it seemed like it was unstoppablethat is until its cousin came along to trump it. Not only is the 2013 addition thinner and sleeker, its 4 times as powerful and is well worth upgrading. Google partnered with Asus once again but this time ditched the Tegra chipset and threw in the Snapdragon CPU and Adreno GPU. Once you open the box you will immediately notice the physical changes to the tablet. The deep black and the overall more rectangle shape and sharper edges look slick and clean. Gone is the soft bumpy back from before replaced with plastic and a beveled Nexus logo. I do miss that soft back as it didn't scratch, but the new back still has a soft fuzzy feeling to it.\n\nApart from that you will also notice the front facing camera has moved to the right as there is now a back camera that is 5.0 MP. The front camera has improved slightly by 0.1 MP but it makes a difference. While other tablets have more powerful rear facing cameras the Nexus 7 does record in 1080p and looks pretty good in well-lit areas. I would have liked to see at least an 8 MP camera, but just having a camera added is a great addition. There isn't a flash so the camera is nearly useless at night.\n\nLets talk about the screen. Its absolutely gorgeous. The 19201200 resolution LCD screen looks clear, bright, and crisp. The resolution upgrade is very noticeable compared to the 2012 model. With 323 ppi everything is going to pop out at you from games to comics. The sound is also something I love in this tablet that most tablets don't have. We have 5.1 surround sound in this thing. Two small speakers at the bottom and a large one at the top. The speakers are made by Fraunhofer who are the guys who invented the MP3. I immediately noticed the sound difference when I started playing games. It sounds like everything is coming at your from all angles, its rich, crisp, and so much clearer than the 2012 model.\n\nSo whats under the hood? The speed increase is incredible as apps load faster and things just process at a much faster rate. My comics rendered faster, games loaded quicker, and I had zero hang when loading graphic heavy websites in Chrome or switching apps quickly. The Snapdragon Krait 300 CPU is clocked at 1.51 Ghz and is quad-core. This is much faster than the 2012s 1.3 Ghz CPU. The Adreno 320 GPU helps a lot as well and is loads faster than the Tegra 3. Games looked better and everything loaded so much faster. For example, on the 2012 model I could not select the best graphics option in Rival Knights, on the 2013 model I could. I also had a lot of slow down with low framerate on the 2012 model in Joe Devers Lone Wolf. On the 2013 model it ran at 60 FPS.\n\nThe battery also lasts a good while for a slimmer battery. You will get hours of gaming or reading out of this thing even with Wifi on. Besides processing speed the 2013 model has Bluetooth 4.0, screen mirroring, Qi wireless battery charging, a notification indicator at the bottom of the tablet. These may not seem like much but they make a big difference for an upgrade. Not to mention the loose charging port from the previous model has been fixed with a more sturdy USB slot. The tablet is also 2 ounces lighter so you cant really complain.\n\nBottom line: The Google Nexus 7 (2013) is the best 7 inch tablet you can get your hands on at a great price. If you own the 2012 model I highly recommend the upgrade like I did. Its fast, sleek, has a gorgeous screen, and has fantastic surround sound speakers."}

If you need to do a reset or change a setting I find that I have to go look for a youtube video as the online documentation provided by Google is so lacking.\n\nThis extends to the touch screen where the touch point is sometimes indicated and sometimes not. When it is not provided it becomes a trial and error process to determine what movement in what location will work. This is far inferior to the iPad user interface and operating system and application. Once again one has to pay double and buy an Apple product (and put up with their stupid iTunes file management process) to get a small device that works properly and in a nearly intuitive manner.\n\nSad that the people at Google did not bother to hire UI people for their development efforts.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I want to start by saying that it has a jaw-dropping resolution. Sound is very crisp, but not loud enough when noise is present wherever you are. Although it has had very minor issues (that have nothing to do with hardware), they have been solved as Android has released new versions of the software for this tablet. The only aspect that I hate about companies different than Samsung is that they do not let expand memory on their devices. In fact, I thought it was going to be trouble, but I haven't even used half of my memory because I prefer the cloud, which in my opinion is a hundred times more reliable. Also, I have the highest Internet speed in my area, so online storage for me is very accesible. Overall, I would definitely recommend it to anyone. A very simple advice to those who are not advanced tablet users and don't know how much space they should buy is to get any tablet that has at least 32 GB of memory. Trust me on that, because 16 GB is most of the time not enough. I hope I have helped all of you with this review. Good luck with the Nexus 7!"}

Reading feels natural (the screen is about the size of supermarket paperback).  Service from Google and Amazon was above what was expected when I forgot to recharge and they were extremely patient and gentle with me.

I am so frustrated that something so simple caused so much frustration.  Due to this annoying design flaw I am sticking with my 3 star rating, but I am THRILLED to have my Nexus alive again!!! ***\n\nI bought my Nexus 7 last August when it first came out, mainly for reading digital comics and fiction.  I LOVED IT.  I used it every day.  I didn't have any complaints.  UNTIL the jellybean update came out and killed it.  My tablet got stuck in a boot loop, or would just crash constantly.  If I was lucky I got 15 minutes of use out of it before it would crash.  Sometimes it wouldn't charge.  Whatever the problem, it was pretty much unusable.  This was early December 2013.  Its now June 2014, and its mainly just an expensive paper weight.  I would have returned it, but the boyfriend found it necessary to unlock the thing and void my warranty.\n\nI wavered a lot before purchasing this device because I wasn't sure I could trust the software.  Sadly my fears were proven correct.  Say what you will about Apple devices being overpriced and behind on features, at least you can depend on them to operate for as long as you want to keep the device.\n\nI would buy another one immediately if I could trust that I could at least get 2 years of use out of it, but I don't."}

The biggest issue I have is Amazons stuck up elitist attitude with regard to it working with Amazon instant video or music. If you are a very frequent Amazon prime user, you will be extremely disappointed with their integration (or lack thereof) with this tablet. You can't play any of your music or movies that are on your Amazon drives. You can't even download them to your computer and then put them on your tablet. Amazon- seriously.

There have been several updates to the software of the device since its release. (Prompt updates are are expected with a nexus device).\n\nThe screen is excellent. Videos and games look great on this device, however the sound is rather average and isn't very loud. It has duel speakers on the back instead of the front which would be better, but most devices have the speakers in the back which makes it average not terrible. The over all build is simple and minimalistic but feels premium. The back has a grippy soft touch feel to it with a matte finish that is not slippery, and doesn't show fingerprints. It feels great in the hand, Its very light and thin.\n\nIt has a quad core snapdragon sp400 1.5 GHz processor and 2 gigs of ram. It runs very smooth and with these specs should perform quite well for sometime. The specs are ever better than some more expensive 2014 Samsung tablets in this size category.\n\nOverall, very reasonable price, looks and feels great, and handles even better. Speakers are average.

There are an exhaustive number of great reviews on both already so I'll keep it brief.\n\nThe iPad mini simply doesn't compare. This Nexus has far better hardware. It runs faster than iPad mini, by far and the internet loads far more quickly. AppStore loads way slower than Google Play on Nexus and downloads are much faster on Nexus even though both are on the same network.\n\nCosmetically, I prefer the wide screen format of Nexus over iPad's older screen dimension.  The clarity is clearly better on Nexus too. Also, the text on iPad is minuscule to the point of being annoying. I enabled large fonts and even went into the Accessibility options and activated the largest text and bold, and still the fonts are about 6pt at best. Very inconvenient. Nexus isn't like that and I find it much easier to read. Activating the dark background on iPad did help some though. The screen just isn't as vibrant as Nexus. iPad does have a decent 3 finger tap zoom feature, but it sorely needs to be improved in this arena.  Nexus also has zoom features, but I find I don't really need it, where as, with iPad, it's an absolute must.\n\nGraphic intensive games play far better on Nexus than iPad, though I will say the overall game quality seems to be a tad better on iPad.  Angry Birds is Angry Birds. It renders faster on Nexus, but iPad seems to have a more interesting selection of apps I've never seen before. But I'm new to iPad so maybe the App Store is just more of a novelty right now.  I will say that I find Google Play far easier to navigate and more pleasing to the eye.  And generally, App Store's free apps seem to be riddled with heavy handed advertising. You see that on some Google Play apps too, but not as aggressively as iPad.\n\nI have always considered myself an Android guy, and in all honesty, I don't see that changing.  I have an 8.9\" Fire HDX for personal use and this Nexus and my iPad for work.  I'd say that iPad has done nothing to sway me over to iOS. I like it, but it just doesn't hold a match to either HDX or Nexus, as far as user experience and power.  If I had to pick just one, I'd say this Nexus is the winner, due to the specs and form factor.\n\nI got my iPad mini for a great deal at 230 brand new. But it's only 16gb and has less than half the computing power of Nexus.  I paid 221 for my Nexus and it's 32gb. This Nexus just offers way more for the money than iPad, which typically can't be had new for under $270.\n\nHaving used both iPad mini and Nexus on a daily basis for work -- hands down, Nexus is the clear winner in price, function, usability and quality. Not even close. Sorry iPad."}

I use it all the time and I loved it so much that I bought him one for our anniversary a couple months ago.  He hated his big 10\" tablet from work because it was so bulky.  This one is thin and light and just right for reading or sitting on the couch and he loves his so much that I can't get him to put it down.  The battery life is also a thing of wonder.  Because of it, he never has to put it down.  I've read for ten hours straight without needing to plug it in.  In fact, I pass out before it does.  I would recommend it to anyone who has wi-fi and doesn't need a modem.  It's perfect."}

Gen 2 seems to have a pretty pervasive touchscreen problem that causes it to be laggy and non-responsive even though it's running KitKat 4.4.3.  I \"googled\" this issue and found a ton of forum related posts and discussions regarding this issue.  Surprisingly enough, people have been reporting this since Oct/Nov 2013 without any official response/fix by either Asus or Google.  Anyway, I was able to find a settings adjustment involving changing about 5 or 6 settings that people claim has solved their problems.  I made these and at first glance, it may have fixed it.  But honestly, you never know about this kind of fix for a couple months.  This problem was sporadic and can't be judged until some time has passed.  I just posted this because of my disappointment with Google/Asus allowing this issue to persist after having been discovered quite some time ago.  I will update this after some trials and before the deadline for returning."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "First off, anything from Asus is garbage in my mind. I myself have never had any luck with their products and a few I know haven't either. I would buy this from Google (if you have to) as they will probably be more responsive to your needs. First off I am an Computer Science and Electrical Engineer. I am not a huge fan of Android (turned down my third interview at Google if you mush know a few years back). However, it has proven itself in the market and people seem to like it better than iOS (they are split about 50-50 it seems). That is not the problem with this device. The device is the problem. Yes Android supposedly had a battery issue within the OS where if it got below a certain level you had to go through some reboot sequence to fix it or else update the OS...I won't go into detail, but you can read about it.\n\nNOPE, this is a quality of manufacturing issue. The device belongs to my girlfriend's son who actually got the extended warranty which I thought covered EVERYTHING. Not according to ASUS. The first thing he noticed is sometimes his device would not charge all the way. I was thinking battery, but then it stopped completely. OK, you have the warranty send it back. NOT that easy. They were on the phone for hours with Google, Walmart (where it was purchased) and even ASUS. Seriously folks, THEY BOUGHT the extended Warranty!\n\nSO they sent it in to ASUS. They sent an email that it was going to cost $150 to fix. What? The device was $229 when he bought it back in December or January. So they sent it back. Time for the engineer to look into it. Took it to work and be ****ed the warranty, I took it all apart. The issue you ask? Poor soldering! YEP, VERY POOR (Thank you cheap Chinese labor). They call it abuse, but the micro-USB on the board is inadequate as it is. What did I do? A new connector, soldered a lot more reliably and voila' FIXED! And they wanted $150? Her son is convinced never again to buy anything from ASUS. My girlfriends Dell tablet and my iPad are working just fine!"}

If i plug in a usb ethernet adapter that works on any other android device, i have to drop down to a terminal emulator to find out the IP.  the nexus is missing a base feature that's in android for recognizing other network connections.  Google's BS makes me want to give it three or less stars, but everything else it does it does exceptionally well, and i can at least get around the storage issue using free 3rd party apps so put that in my pipe and smoke it google."}

The all run Android/Cyanogenmod well and I still haven't scratched any of them, despite taking no special precautions (a bumper on the Nexus 4 is all). But this Nexus 7 drives me crazy because of the poor battery life. I run the same software on all my devices (with the exception of the 4, which runs far more), and I'm lucky if I can get two days out of this with minimal use (mostly web surfing less than 2 hours a day). Once it gets past the 50% mark, it's pretty much going to be dead by the time I pick it up again. By comparison, I can get a 1-2 weeks out of my Nexus 10, using it the same way (and I usually use that for youtube as well).\n\nIf you want something in the 7-inch form, I'd look into another brand. If you don't mind going bigger, and you can still find it, the Nexus 10 is the finest tablet I ever put my hands one (I have no idea why they discontinued it). It takes forever to charge, so it might not be good for heavy gamers (which can kill the battery in hours), but it's the best tablet for surfing and youtube. Lighter than the iPad."}

I started surfing the internet when it was a black screen with white lettering, we didn't refer to it as the internet than we refereed to it as an \"Bulletin Board\".

Anyone old enough to utilize commonsense should know that anytime something is mass produced there are going to be glitch in few of the parts.\n\nI make it a point to read any and all reviews of a product I am able to find, the internet makes it considerable easier and more concise than previously \"Word of Mouth technique we used in the ole' days.

LAN into my local network, FTP to my seedbox, streaming true 720p & 1080p video files which are 6-8GB each with ease. It even has the power to skip forward on the stream with only a 1 second buffer. That's a lot to ask for even my Intel i3 media center tower. I've had this for over a month and probably charge it once a week. It uses almost no battery. I played music via bluetooth for 2 days straight camping and it only got down to 65%. The bluetooth antenna also has an impressive range. Combined with my Blockrocker, I was able to walk 60 ft away without skipping a beat. The shell is solid with no flexing or sounds when I handle it, even roughly. I don't use a case with it. I'm fairly certain it is indestructible, but I don't have kids yet ;-). Asus is a good \"go to\" brand for quality products. If I you don't build your own computers, I'd suggest checking out their PC's next time you are in the market.\n\nCons: No SD card slot. I love having a 32gb sd card in my phone for music. This now isn't really a problem since I'm using Spotify and no longer pirating music (mostly). The only other things I could complain about are little nit picky things about Android, which is only quasi-relevant to this review, like a Dell owner complaining about the windows start menu.\n\nOther thoughts: Google is now my preferred source for tablets. The purity of the Android on this device is unmatched. I don't like manufacture's manipulation of operating systems.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I spent some time going through all of the tablets online and trying to find one that met my needs.  I was attracted to the Nexus 7 by the size of the internal memory and the screen resolution.  I am totally pleased with my choice.\n\nThis is the third tablet I have owned and totally outshines the other two.  It is simply a mini-computer, allowing me to print and create my own docs.  Best of all I was able to get a Bluetooth keyboard and a Bluetooth mouse and they  work well together.  I already have dozens of apps on the tablet and still have 21GB left.  My last tablet had 8GB and was filled before I had much on it.\n\nCan't say enough about the screen.  The HD quality is incredible.  It's easy to read the small letters, even with my elderly eyes.  I'm looking forward to downloading movies to watch.\n\nThe speed is quicker than I could have hoped for and the Google version of \"Siri\" works better than the original.  There have been very few times when it didn't figure out what I was asking.\n\nI would absolutely recommend the 2013 Nexus 7 to anyone looking to buy a tablet.  I was able to get mine through Walmart for a ridiculously low price and added the keyboard and mouse to create a complete \"system\" for less than $50.  The HP 4000b mouse works very well."}

The speakers are nice and it fits well in the hand, and I can get through the day with about 20% battery remaining. The one problem I had with the device, though, is that I went to bed one day and, not thinking, placed the device on my table upside-down with my cell phone on top of it. When I turned it on in the morning, I saw a blue almost airbrush effect on the screen in the corner when I'm viewing a black or dark image.\n\nI then had this happen again when I placed the device in the laptop sleeve of a backpack in the opposite corner.\n\nWhile this is completely my fault, my point is to be careful with the device, as I find that it's fragile compared to other tablets such as the Galaxy Tab 3 or even the previous generation Nexus. If you were to get a case or something for it, you should be good to go. And don't be afraid to return it if there's a dead pixel, etc. when you first get it; reports online say that manufacturer defects are more common than before with the Nexus 2013."}

I sent it in to ASUS for repair, and it came back with the same problem, plus a chipped corner of the screen!  I sent it in yet again, figuring they'd be shamed into really getting on it this time - that was a month ago.  When I call them, no one can say what is going on, or when I may expect to see it again.\n\nI plan to buy something else, and it won't be from ASUS.  With all the appealing choices there are in the marketplace, a product with negligent and indifferent manufacturer support is not worth having unless you don't mind just tossing it in the event that it fails.

I was weighing this against a refurbished original iPad Mini and decided mostly based on cost and the fact that I really wanted a retina display! It's been an excellent tablet. The display really is beautiful and it's noticeably faster than my iPad 2. I also really like the form factor; it's very comfortable to hold onto for gaming or reading. The display also contributes to a great reading experience. The battery life was better than I expected - I knew it wouldn't last as long as an iPad but I can get through a few evenings' use without a charge.\n\nA few drawbacks to keep in mind:\nThe Android market doesn't have nearly the selection of tablet apps that iOS does - the disparity for tablet apps is much greater than for phone apps. Also the device does become noticeably warm if you spend some time watching videos or playing an intensive game."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "My husband and I have been having problems with warranty service on the 2013 Nexus 7 tablet.\n\nOur device had a blurry rear camera and we sent it in for warranty service for the camera.  There was no visible damage on the device when we sent it in.  ASUS repaired it and returned it to us.  When we received it, the camera worked fine (no more blurriness), the LCD worked fine, however, there was a small crack in the plastic bezel around the outside of the screen.  Since the bezel was cracked during the RMA process, we initiated a second RMA to repair the cracked bezel from the first RMA.\n\nWe're now in the middle of the second RMA process.  ASUS has had the device for two weeks.  On Sunday evening (11 May), we received an email indicating that our device had a cracked LCD screen, which was not covered by warranty and we could either pay $200 to replace the LCD or ASUS would return our device to us.  The email included a picture of a device with a cracked LCD, however, the datestamp on the image was from 5 days before ASUS received our device, and the device in the picture was clearly not a 2013 Nexus 7 tablet (in fact, we believe it was an ASUS branded 10\" tablet).  We immediately responded that the device in the picture was not our device, nor was it the same model as our device, but we have yet to hear back.\n\nAt this point, our RMA for the blurry rear camera has taken two RMAs, 6 weeks, and we're concerned that ASUS has lost our device or is otherwise mistracking it.  While we have been very happy with ASUS devices so far, we are very frustrated with the ASUS warranty service that we are receiving for this product.  We approached a service agent who left his information on an Amazon review on this tablet, and we received a return email saying that they would issue a \"discount\" on the repair.  We do not understand why a \"discount\" would even be offered on a device that is clearly not ours.  When we called to check on the RMA to see if there was any sort of response to our email, we were told that there was no way to know if the repair facility located our device or where it was in the repair process.\n\nFor timeline, this is what we've experienced -\nFirst RMA:  for a blurry rear-facing camera\n- device shipped on 04 April\n- device received 10 April\n- device received 18 April\n\nSecond RMA: for the bezel that was damaged during the first RMA -- ASUS paid the shipping for this since the damage was caused during the ASUS RMA process\n- reported bezel damage on device 18 April (date received from repair facility)\n- device shipped 24 April\n- device received 30 April\n- contacted 09 May on status update of device\n- received email regarding cracked LCD 11 May, with a picture of a device that isn't mine and with a timestamped (25 April) photograph that indicates the device was in their facility before my device was received (30 April) by the facility\n\nTo this date, we have yet to receive any word on our device, nor an apology for the email or how this has been handled.  Trying to get a hold of someone who can actually tell us where our device is and when we can get it back has been a complete nightmare."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I am a college student and I owned a Sony tablet S (sold) and an iPad mini (gave away) before, so I pretty familiar with tablets and all its strengths and weaknesses. I mainly use tablets for checking my class materials (pdf) and reading news, sometimes watching stream videos, and occasionally do some gaming. All I need is something that is in a fair price as well as easy to carry around. After I done some research online I decided to give the 2nd gen Nexus 7 a shot. It is on sale right now and has all those decent specs to meet my needs. For now, I have used it for about two weeks, and I should say that I absolutely love it! I keep it in my backpack every day to school and I just can't get my hand off it even when I am in bed. It runs so fast and so smooth, I enjoy using it to play the Real Racing 3 and Dear Trigger, and I really prefer watching live sports games on it. To keep this review short, I'll just list some pros and cons I thought about this little but powerful device.\n\nPros:\n1. Amazing screen. I have put my friend's iPad Air side by side with this tablet; the display looks just as good as the so called \"retina\" screen if no better. Everybody should know here that although a \"retina\" iPad air has a 2048x1536 resolution which is indeed higher than the Nexus 7s 1920x1200 but its pixel density is only 264, in contrast, the nexus 7 has a higher 323 ppi (pixels per inch), which means the Nexus has a sharper screen and you could tell once you play HD videos.\n2. Great build quality. I think Asus is truly a good brand and they made some really great tablets (ex. Transformer book), and what they have done with the Nexus 7 is rather impressive. It is light and easy to hold, and I don't see any place flimsy or bendable. The overall build quality is just top notch.\n3. Fast performance. I don't have to put the tech specs here to impress but honestly I think this tablet performance so well that for the first time I think the Android tablet is really catching up with the iPad: great UI and smooth performance\n4. Running Android 4.4 KitKat. This is a nice addition if you purchase a google device, I know that the mainstream Android devices would get the 4.4 eventually but google device is no doubt where you get it first and fast.\n\nCons:\n1. Battery life is unimpressive. To be fair, the battery life on Nexus 7 is good enough but not excellent. I understand that due to the size factor it can only pack a small size battery than an iPad does. Average 7-8 hours is still something that bothers me because after I play some none hi-spec demand games for a straight hour the battery would significant drops 18-22 percent (ex. Happy Store). However, if you only use it for reading news or jumping around some lifestyle apps (ex. Facebook) it would last longer than 8 hrs. And the good thing is if you put it in sleep mode it won't make you lose too many drains (5% battery drops after a night without plug in outlet).\n2. No SD card expansion. This is a huge disappoint since I have several SD card which hold my files that I need to access. And the 32 GB internal story is not that big you will soon find you are in a shortage after you download several high quality films and some big title games\nAll in all, I enjoy my experience on the Nexus 7 and I would like to recommend it to anyone who looking for a tablet with both portability and great performance."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "First of all, I was shopping for a new device to control a camera drone, and the software it used had 3 main requirements: built-in GPS chip, USB OTG, and Android only - not iOS compatible. That meant no Apple this time, so after some research on Android devices with the requirements I needed, I decided on the Nexus 7 because it is the reference device for the Android operating system - no bloatware, no custom interface, just vanilla unmodified Android.\n  Now then, I want to say up front that I am an avid iPhone owner - as well as a Macbook Air owner. I like the apple ecosystem. I use iCloud. I also used to have an iPad, then an iPad 2, and then an iPad Mini (all sold because I didn't use them that often). When it came time to get another tablet, logically I would be a candidate to get another iPad - yet after using the Nexus 7 FHD (2013) for the last couple of weeks now, I already feel like it's been much more of a value and way more useful than any of the iPads I've owned - here are my thoughts:\n\nImpressive Audio/Video\nFor a sub-10\" tablet, the Nexus 7 offers up an excellent audio/video combination. The 1920 x 1080p full HD screen is bright, vivid, and crystal clear. The colors look very good, there seems to be no streaking or blurring during video playback, and the 16:9 ratio is perfect for watching movies on Netflix or POV action camera footage. Compared to my old iPad Mini (non-retina) there is a noticeable difference in clarity and crispness - understandable because the iPad Mini only sports a 1024 x 768 resolution - for double the price.\n  Also impressive is the audio. The Nexus 7 features two stereo speakers at the bottom rear of the case. Much louder than the iPad Mini, the sound also seems more crisp; I'm not sure if this is due to the built-in \"synthetic surround sound\" software, but if the sound sounds excellent to my ears, I don't really care how it's achieving it.\n  As for the on-board camera, by the numbers the Nexys 7 matches the iPad Mini - 5MP rear camera, 1.2MP front camera. I've taken a few photos with the rear camera just for testing, and the photos come out just fine (though to be honest I always prefer using my phone camera over a tablet camera). The front camera was tested using Skype, and those on the other end informed me that they couldn't tell a difference between iPad Mini and Nexus 7 video quality, so no big deal here.\n\nGetting Used to Android OS\nThe Nexus 7 ships with Kit-Kat 4.3, but as of this writing the current version is 4.4.2. My Nexus 7 started downloading the 4.4.2 update in the background once I got connected to my home WiFi, while I was still doing the intial device setup. By the time I was at the home screen ready to use the tablet, the download was ready and it took a couple of minutes to get the device up to 4.4.2. Using the Android operating system took some learning to do - this from for someone who's never spent any time with Android, and is super familiar with the iOS operating system. In fact, I did find myself doing iOS things only to find that they do not work - for example, iOS gestures. This isn't a knock on Android at all though - this is just a case of me having to learn my way around a new operating system. However, after a few days I was comfortable using Android, and within 2 weeks of purchase I'm pretty confident that I can get myself around Android just as good as with iOS.\n\nSD/Micro-USB Port\nThere are some complaints about how the Nexus 7 does not have a removable SD card slot like other Android devices, however when compared to the iPad Mini you could easily say the same thing. What gives the Nexus 7 the one-up is its standard micro-USB port. Not just for charging, the micro-USB port is compatible with standard USB flash drives, external hard drives, and more. All I have to do is plug the flash drive into the Nexus 7 and I can transfer movies, music, and other data files directly, with no need to connect to a computer and use extra software.\n  I can also plug my GoPro or Contour POV action cameras and watch recorded footage on the Nexus 7 - directly from the camera's SD card, no need to copy the video files to the Nexus 7 beforehand, no media format conversion either. Just to be clear, unless you have a USB flash drive with a built-in micro-USB plug, you will need an inexpensive $4 OTG cable that converts the micro-USB to standard USB Type-A. In comparison, the above scenarios are not available with an iPad mini without a bunch of extra steps involving iTunes, media conversion, and dealing with their super-restrictive Lightning cable.\n\niCloud Syncing\nProbably the biggest question I had when I decided to use the Nexus 7 as my primary tablet was getting it to work in sync with my primary phone (iPhone) and primary computer (Macbook Air). I rely on iCloud for certain important data - specifically contacts and calendars. I already use Gmail so that's not a problem, nor is Google Docs - both of which function as expected under Android. However, when it came to contacts and calendars I use iCloud, but it turns out that there are free apps in the Google Play store that let my Nexus 7 sync my contacts and calendars in both directions with iCloud - problem solved, works seamlessly. I have my important data synced across platforms, which is always convenient.\n\nBattery Life\nBeing used to the iPad Mini's 6,471mAh battery life, I'm not surprised nor bothered at all that the Nexus 7 doesn't last as long; The Nexus 7 battery is 3,950mAh, and under regular usage I found that the battery life of the Nexus felt about 1/2 to 2/3 of what I remember my iPad Mini having. I did not scientifically test this - I'm just going by what I remember from having an iPad Mini before, but even if it doesn't last as long, the Nexus still can last the whole day for me; I always charge before I go to bed so that the device is at 100% in the morning, and the lowest I've seen the nexus 7 battery go down to in the late evening is about 20%.\n\nHome Button\nThere is no home button, because this is not an iPad. I was so used to waking up my iPad by tapping on the home button, but with the Nexus 7 this is not the case; the sleep button is on the side of the Nexus 7, so it's not as convenient to use since the tablet might slide around if you try to push the sleep button on the side without holding the tablet first.\n\nApps\nThe Google Play Store is not as expansive and vast as the Apple App Store, but there are many quality apps available, plus some features that aren't available or take more steps to do on the Apple App Store. One example is remote installation: I can browse Google Play apps on my desktop browser at home or work, purchase an app (free or paid), and install it with the click of a button to my Nexus 7 - even if the actual tablet is somewhere else. No need to fire up iTunes, no syncing, nada. The flipside to that is refunds - many Google Play apps have a timed refund button on the app page itself; if you buy a paid app, install it, and find that it's not really what you were expecting or looking for, you can click the \"refund\" button on the app page and Google Play will refund your purchase and automatically uninstall the app from your tablet just like that. the last time I remember trying to get a refund for an Apple Store app, it involved looking for the invoice# and contacting Apple support through email and waiting for a response.\n\n\"Rooting\" (Optional)\nWhen you \"root\" an Android device, you're not so much modifying the operating system, but you're basically giving yourself admin permission to access the OS. It's similar to having a basic user account on a PC vs. having administrator privileges. Once your device is rooted you can install and customize your Android device with anything from small tweaks to complete OS replacement. Unlike iOS, Android openly embraces device rooting.\n  In contrast - on iOS, to unlock the operating system and install outside apps, you have to jailbreak the device - which involves modifying the existing operating system. Though not illegal, Apple frowns upon this practice for the sake of integrity, and in return does all it can to disable/block jailbreaking with every update of its operating system. The current iOS version cannot be jailbroken, so those who enjoy jailbreaking and using outside apps/tweaks are stuck on an older version of the iOS (including my iPhone).\n\nChromecast (Option, $35)\nThough optional, picking up a Google Chromecast is probably the best accessory for the Nexus 7. It allows me to watch video on any HDMI-equipped TV - Netflix, YouTube, etc. No longer am I limited to just the Nexus 7 screen - it's a nice screen yes, but sometimes I would like to sit on the couch and watch my entertainment on a large HDTV. Sure - you can do the same with iOS and an Apple TV - and Apple TV does more than just project remote video - but for simple movie viewing you're looking at spending $99 for an Apple TV compared to $35 for a Chromecast.\n\nBang for the Buck\nInitially I was going to get the $199 16GB WiFi version, but I went with the $239 32GB WiFi version for some extra on-board storage. Aside from storage capacity, the hardware specs are the same - 1920 x 1080p resolution 7 HD screen, 2GB of RAM, 5MP rear and 1.2MP front cameras, GPS chip (even if its only a WiFi model), stereo speakers with synthetic surround sound and a quad-core processor are the important bits. At the time of this writing, the comparable iPad model (iPad Mini non-retina WiFi) with a lower resolution screen and no GPS chip costs $299 - $100 more than the Nexus 7. Because I chose to go with the 32GB version, the comparable iPad model is not the regular Mini, since it only comes in 16GB. I would have to get the iPad Mini with Retina (WiFi) to get 32GB of on-board storage, and that model is $499 - that's more than double the price of the Nexus 7.\n\nConclusion - I Really Like It!\nUsing the Nexus 7 is different form using the iPad Mini, and I think that is part of the reason why I'm a lot happier with the Nexus 7 as my daily usage tablet; I realized that I wasn't that happy with the iPad Mini because it basically felt like I was using my iPhone - with just a larger, not as crisp screen. The pricing difference between comparable Nexus 7 and iPad Mini models are another big factor - although a lot of people rely on specs and number comparisons to decide what is \"better\" I prefer to use my eyes and ears to judge what looks/sounds good to me, and the Nexus 7's crisp HD screen and loud stereo speakers make for an excellent audio-visual experience.\n  All in all it's only been 2 weeks and with everything I've been able to do with the Nexus 7, yet it's easily earned 5-stars from me. I can't see any reason not to strongly consider the Nexus 7 over an iPad Mini thanks to its impressive A/V capabilities, more useful features, and very reasonable price tag."}

Than on April 26 I plug it in to charge and go to use it a few hours later and the screen will not turn on. The device still works as I can hear it unlock using facial recognition. I can also guess where the numbers are and unlock the device that way too. I can make it ring using find my android. I can also plug it in to a PC and browse the files. Just what appears to be a randomly broken screen. No damage to the device at all and it has never been dropped. I babied the device.\nAfter calling best buy and learning their return and exchange policy is ONLY 15 days and that they would not take it back, I called google. Google was no help and told me to call Asus. Asus gave me an RMA number and I have to return it at my own expense for warranty repair. Btw, they say they may send you a re-manufactured or re-certified device in its place.....I have a screen protector on the device which will ruin the protector if I remove it, so I guess that is also more money down the drain. To make it worse I will have to pay for data while my device is away getting repaired or replaced.\nIf you google nexus 7 screen problems or nexus 7 power problems. It's scary the amount of people with similar problems. There are all sorts of different power on/off sequences with power on and volume buttons to try and fix but none of them actually do.\nWill report back with what my experience with Asus is like. Very disappointed in best buy. If they can't guarantee a product for at least 30 days then they do not deserve my future business. Lots of other retailers both on and offline which still do 30 day.\n\nupdate: May 7 2014,\n\nAsus has had the device for 1 full week now, they have not been able to provide me a status online or through their support team. I am beginning to fear the worst. Their online status webpage says it take 1 business day after receiving item to update status. Asus support says devices are typically turned around in 5 to 7 days. Both statements have come to be false!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I went out shopping for a tablet to run Dashmeter Pro in a sim racing cockpit I have (Obutto Ozone). At first that was my only reason for buying into the android family. I was looking for something around $100 for that purpose alone. I have an iPhone and recently sold an iPad 2 because I never used it. It was bulky and uncomfortable to hold on to. Without a case it was even harder to hold onto.\n\nEnter the Nexus 7. Working in IT and selling online I knew all about it. I just didn't think I would use a tablet after not using the iPad. Again I thought my only purpose for a tablet would be to run my sim racing gauges. I went to the local best buy to take a look at those $100 tablets and realized that they were seriously terrible. I looked at a 7 Samsung tab ($140) side by side with the nexus and while it was nice it took about twice as long to do anything on it. After some deliberation I decided to go for the 32gb Nexus in hopes that maybe I would use it around the house a little bit.\n\nI am happy to report that I haven't put this thing down since I brought it home. Coming to android from iOS is like a breath of fresh air. I can do more of what I want to on this tablet. Its light and powerful, easy to hold and the screen is amazing. Love that the back is the matte material that is ultra-easy to grip onto. Ive been using it nonstop for web browsing, youtube, hulu and games. I highly recommend NBA Jam! Anyway the tablet is excellent at everything. I am using it waaayyy more than I ever used my iPad. Plus at $250 its much cheaper than the 6 or $700 I spent on the iPad.\n\nA few cons but nothing serious. Out of the box it doesnt support DTS audio. Not a huge deal. There is a work around for it and honestly files with DTS audio are too big to be using on a mobile device anyway. That brings me to the next concern which is no expandable memory. Get the 32gb to be on the safe side. No one ever said I wish I had less space on a device. There are some USB options for more space but not as clean as having a micro sd card.\n\nOverall its an excellent tablet and well worth the money. I wouldnt hesitate to buy it again or recommend it to others. You really can't go wrong picking this tablet over others at even higher price points."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "Comparison: overall, the first look at this had me thinking it was narrower, and it is, but not the actual screen. It is the space around the screen that has been brought in. What advantage does this have? Well, it fits a little easier in the hands. This comes in handy for reading and it just feels like you're holding a rectangle versus the more square version on the old tablet.\n\nScreen: Seems brighter and more vibrant than before. The screen also feels slightly smoother, but it's not really that noticeable.\n\nQuicker? Maybe a tad.\n\nBattery life? Remains to be seen. I only got this tablet on Thursday and had charged it up that day, used the tablet for a few hours over the weekend, and the battery was at half yesterday, so I charged it up. It doesn't seem to get as warm as the 1st tablet did, although it's not like that one was burning hot.\n\nOne thing I really like is that the sides are now completely black, versus having that little bit of silver in there before -- I had been afraid to nick it on something, but I am somewhat of a perfectionist.\n\nI do like the way the screen turns off on this one. For those who have the first model and go to this one, it's more like turning off your t.v.  Kind-of cute the way it turns off.\n\nI did buy this refurbished, as I did the first one, and both came looking new, so I just wanted to add that I didn't buy it new (Asus does certify their refurbs, and they do a good job at sending out \"like new\" products with a 90 day warranty).\n\nOverall, I don't notice a big difference between my old tablet and this new one, but I do like the feel of it in my hands just because it is narrower. I have also ordered a cover for it, one that will close up around it versus the sleeve. I recommend that, as the sleeve got annoying as you have to be careful with the zipper, and then when you are using the tablet, you don't feel as protected as you do with a cover. My mom has one for her iPad mini and I liked it.\n\nPrimary uses for me are reading, then paying bills, etc., Facebooking, and crossword puzzles/games, etc.\n\nAlmost forgot to add: this tablet DOES have a front and rear camera, so it is possible to take selfies, unlike the old model."}

But I got pointers from hither and thither, and finally decided this would be suitable to my needs. Then I found out from a few highly respected computer-head friends of mine that this is one of the best tablets out there. Schweet. I gave myself points for that, though I'm still nothing even vaguely resembling a techy.\nAnyway, I saved and saved all my pennies till I finally could get it! Of course, I wanted the 32GB as opposed to the 16 since it doesn't have external memory (one downside. I will get over it. Yay cloud storage, too) and I think that will last me a while, since I'm not planning on downloading fifty gazillion aps and whatnot. I mostly wanted it for school, and I think it will serve its purpose well.\nNot having had a tablet before, and having only occasionally used similar technology in the past, I dont' really have much to relate it to... I actually had to re-order this because within the first week or so the power button stopped working. Obviously manufacture defect. But replacing it was a cinch. But it seems to be good. Reasonably fast and all that. Since I put a protective case/screen protector on, it is occasionally difficult to hit buttons (especially on the edge grrrr) which is frustrating, but I understand that is a common problem with touchscreen tech.... or maybe I'm just that tech-challenged.

I've been wanting to switch to a Google tablet for a while now since Google Play offers more of a variety when it comes to apps, unlike the Kindle. So far, I'm highly impressed by the Nexus 7.\n\nSome things I like:\n\n01. The size and weight of the tablet. I have small hands and while I could hold the Kindle in one hand, it couldn't for long before my fingers started to cramp. However, I can hold the Nexus easily in one hand, which makes it easy to read on.\n\n02. The keyboard. I've found it's easier to type on than the Kindle and iPad (I use an iPad at work sometimes) keyboards are. Also, it has a built-in emoji keyboard, which is nice since most of my friends use Apple products and now I can see what they're posting to Twitter when they use emojis.\n\n03. Battery life. The battery is superb. I was able to play a game on the tablet for an hour straight without the battery dying on me like with other tablets I've used.\n\n04. KitKat. The description of this tablet says it has JellyBean, but the tablet does update the software to KitKat.\n\n05. Display. It's crisp and clear. I used the HBOGo app to watch Game of Thrones and was highly impressed by the picture quality. It also makes reading books/emails/news articles a lot easier, especially for someone who doesn't have the best eyesight to begin with (like me!).\n\n06. Quickness. The tablet is fast.\n\n07. Sound. The sound quality is really, really good, especially with earbuds.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about this tablet is how the power button and volumes are positioned on the side of the tablet. I find myself fumbling to find the right one to press."}

The built-in speaker should easily be able to handle twice the volume level that it currently does, which makes it almost useless to try to listen to audio if there is any background noise.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I had the original Nexus 7.  After a while that slowed to a crawl.  And I pretty much stopped using it.  I bought the Nexus 10 and love it.  Then Google released 4.3 with fstrim support and my old Nexus 7 was back to it's old speed.  I didn't think I would buy the 2013 edition since the old one was working so well.  But I had made one big mistake with the original Nexus and had got the 8GB model and kept bumping into the limit.  So I sold it and bought the new one.  And it's significantly faster than the old one.  I personally don't like reading books on it.  For that, I still prefer the e-ink Nook, but my wife likes the Nexus 7 for reading.  The kids use it for homework and to play games.  Mail and Flipboard are the two main apps I use.  The only problem with my Nexuses  (I have 2 Nexus 10s) is that sometimes it's tough finding a free one.  They are certainly getting used a lot more than my iPad ever did.  For the price (and direct upgrades from Google), it's tough to recommend any other 7\" Android tablet.  I feel for the competition."}

I also transfer Word files as backup for meetings I go to, and have to read them in Kindle or as a pdf file.  I did have to find a file manager utility so I could find the files on it.  I also have several alarm clocks, news sites, weather apps, Pomodora timers, an audio recorder (for meetings),\n\nThe biggest pain is that GOOGLE produces the N7, so they force you to use a gmail account to register it, but then also force your account to register as a G+ account.  So things get screwed up because I DO NOT WANT TO USE OR WORK WITH GOOGLE PLUS, and I resent being forced to.  For instance,  apps ask you to rate them, but it requires logging in to Google Plus to enter the rating, so I decline.  Then the damn things keep asking for a rating every few days.  GOOGLE is screwing the usefullness of Android by forcing people to use Google +.  But, once I learn to avoid such obnoxious requests, the N7 is still very usefull.  A limitation is the lack of add on SD card memory.  So I don't use if for anything that is memory intensive."}

We started by identifying our primary uses:  e-mail, surfing the web, reading e-books, checking finances, reading docs and spreadsheets.  Our investigation showed that the Nexus 7 (32 gb) met those needs at a reasonable cost.  The only downside is that the Nexus does not have a slot for a micro-SD card.\n\nWe have not had the Nexus for very long.  It has worked well.  So far, lack of a micro-SD card has not been a problem.  One caution -- the Nexus will use a significant amount of internet and wi-fi bandwidth.  If you have a somewhat slow connection, as we do, you may notice a slowdown on your computers and other internet-connected devices."}

The display is bright and razor sharp. (Just as an e-reader it rivals anything else on the market.) The form factor is a little unusual but very well thought out, and I love that I can just stick it in my back pocket. The audio out from the built-in stereo speakers is clear and surprisingly rich (but of course you'll want to use headphones to get the best sound when you're playing your MP3s). The audio input works great with Skype and video recording, and supports very accurate speech recognition. The cameras take great stills and videos and the built-in photo/video apps are chock full of nice features. Android KitKat 4.4 is rock solid on this device -- I've been using it all day every day for a month and it hasn't had any kind of a glitch ever. I get more than a day off a full charge. The four core ARMv7 CPU is very responsive -- I never feel like I have to wait for it. The charger port also supports full two-way USB I/O functionality. Last but not least, the price point is better than anything else out there. If you're in the market for a tablet in this general size, don't look any further, this one is a real standout!!"}

The added rear camera and new texture are a great improvement over the old model.\n\nMeh: It is just a tiny bit too big for one-handed operation, but doesn't include any keyboard or other settings to make this easier (3rd party tools are available).

The screen is big enough, and it is a nice fit in your hand like a book because it is less wide than other tablets.\n\nFinding reasons to use this tablet has never been easier, as you will find yourself using it hours on end, searching the Playstore to fill it up with any useful apps you can find. Using Pocket to save articles for offline viewing later, Pinterest to save your likes are just some examples of how better it can be utilized.\n\nBattery life is also good. If you use it sparingly, it will last you 2-3 days before a needing a recharge. If used extensively, it can even last a day or 2. The colours and vividness of the tablet pops out, so movies/games are good to go.\n\nIn conclusion, the power and smoothness of this tablet will win you over, as with many numerous reviews on the internet has proved it to be an excellent, lean, powerful paper-thin device."}

In comparison to what some smartphone manufacturers are creating nowadays, it's (generously) a mediocre camera (this applies to both front and back facing cameras).\n\nSummary: If you're looking for an awesome, smooth, sexy and fast tablet with a brilliant display and operating system and a mediocre camera, then this is the tablet for you.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "This is a great tablet!  Yes, there are the occaisonal issue, but it's a tablet -- not a lap top!  Overall the performance is excellent, battery life is very good (if you use an app killer like \"Clean Master\", religiously).  The sound is good relative to it's size, the dimensions are very good and user friendly.\n\nMy only minor criticism is the lock/unlock button is very small, as is the volume rocker switch.  Ideally, I would like to see the switches a little bitter, and perhaps painted white to make them a little easier to find and differentiate.  Minor gripe.\n\nI have owned a few tablet and this is the best one yet, especially at this price point.  I would suggest getting the 32g version."}

I loved the thought of getting the latest android updates first along with a high spec, low cost tablet. Well it worked in the software, the hardware however, was that of a ninety dollar tablet that you would pick up at the grocery store. The camera that ASUS put in there, was horrible. I would have preferred a gorilla glass screen, instead of the camera. That brings me to my next point, the screen. The description says \"scratch resistant screen\", but it is about as scratch resistant as a piece of wet clay. I bought a keyboard case and it put many scratches that were very visible. The keyboard was smooth plastic! One day I had a screen protector (because of the scratches) and a case on it, I picked it up and it cracked right in front of my eyes!!! I then called ASUS and they refused to fix it! That is unless I payed two hundred dollars. Why am I nagging on about asus, you ask? ASUS makes the hardware, Google held up with the software and delivered the promise of the Nexus branding. I would have been much happier buying the Nexus 10 manufactured by Samsung."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I have had an iPad 1 and 2, currently have an iPhone. When I found that I was using the phone more and more and the iPad less and less, I wanted to use a cheaper, lighted pad for reading and some tablet-y things. So I sold the iPad and got a 1st gen Nexus 7. I hated that device. It was frequently laggy, the screen flickered and it was just a displeasure to use. I sold that for a Kindle Fire, which I promptly returned. No Google Play, and the restrictions  that lock it in make the Apple Universe seem liberal in comparison. I then got a refurb Nook HD which I liked very much. A good e-reader with pretty good tablet skills. I didn't like the nonsensical UI though, but because it had a microSD slot, you could add (for 10 bucks) an AndroidForNook card which allows it to dual boot CyanogenMod. I can't say enough about what a great product that was.\nBut I kept hearing things about the Nexus second gen tablet.\nThe build feels good. It is light and thin, almost feels like nothing in your hands. It is fast, no lag, no screen flicker. MKV files play absolutely smoothly and without stutter. The screen is beautiful and feels big. Page rendering on the web is fast. It has dual band wireless support.\nI don't game a lot on it, but it runs a side loaded version of The Walking Dead game beautifully.\n\nOne star off for the reading experience. The screen doesn't darken as well as the Nook, and like the first gen of the Nexus, the screen is just plain old too bright in a dark room, even on the lowest setting. I shouldn't have to use Screen Filter to further darken the screen for night time use.\n\nMy other gripe is not the Nexus' per se but the OS itself. Various options are scattered throughout the Settings, and can be hard to find. It is still hard to understand in any given program what the \"Back\" navigation button will do.\n\nI have always been comfortable with iOS devices, but even a Fanboy can have trouble justifying a device that costs twice as much as the Nexus 7. This device (and the OS, and the Play store) have matured enough that it is now a pleasure to use, and an excellent deal as well."}

I asked my relative to test it for me, seeing as I may have to return it again if it isn't fixed. She did. Issues remained. New RMA created. Sent back to ASUS.\n\nObviously I wasn't happy. However, ASUS did cover the shipping cost for returning the unit the second time around. That put me at ease. At least they care about my business.\n\nRMA came back, they gave me a new unit, and I'm happy to say it's working great! I updated it to Lollipop and everything is good. Changing my review to 4 stars. Not perfect given the QC issues ASUS has when building these.\n\n----------Original Review----------\n\nSo I just bought the Nexus 7 about a week ago at Best Buy. Seeing as I don't live in the States, I took the opportunity to have a relative import one for me. I would've thought twice about this decision after I started using it...\n\nSo, the tablet itself is great. Stereo speakers, great screen, nice, solid build quality... or so I thought. The Nexus came with Android 4.3 pre-installed. Many of the issues I started seeing with the screen I thought would be issues with the Android version it was running. Needless to say, I immediately downloaded Android 4.4.2. Not only were the screen issues not resolved, but the touch issues got worse. Multiple touches being detected on the screen make it IMPOSSIBLE to use. You browse through a site, it clicks a link that you didn't intend to click; you read a book, the screen goes crazy when flipping pages cause it detects multiple touches; you try to pinch-to-zoom, all sorts of wacky things start happening.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm pissed. I live in a country where the Nexus is not sold, and I can't take a plane and return it to Best Buy. A relative is flying to the States next month and will be RMA'ing this ASAP. Asus better replace it, or I just flushed $250 down the toilet.\n\nWhy did I give it two stars? Well cause the tablet itself is awesome... if you're lucky to get a decent unit.\n\nI wouldn't recommend importing one. If you do, make sure you fully test touch screen sensitivity and build quality before you get on a plane back home."}

The Kindle probably has a bit better hardware. And you could get a great selection of free contents (Sherlock, Dr. Who, Skyfall etc.etc.) for FREE.

Sure, I have to touch the screen more than once somethimes for it to register my touch, but I touch pretty lightly most of those times, so I don't think that is a glitch with it, even if I've read tons of reviews of others having touch issues. I don't have enough of an issue to complain. My first android device with more than 8gb of drive space, awesome! I doubt I go back to less! 16gb is just enough, 32 lets me put any app I want on there with no issues of running out of space! AND I can put all kinds of files on it as well! It is definitely noticeably lighter than the 2012. I also have no issues with the slenderness of the screen. I use it to surf the web, facebook, read books and comics, and play games, and it never gives me any trouble! I have had about a dozen different android devices now, and this one is the fastest and easiest to use I have had. I prefer this android over the galaxy tab's version as well. Great buy!\n\nEdit 8-20-15: Passed this on to my 8 tear old about 6 months ago and it is still going strong with lollipop! every once in a while, the touch stops responding completely and I have to hold the power swich a few seconds to get it to turn off, but when I turn it back on, it's as good as new. It has 4 profiles on it with a different email and password for each and only issue is space. Still love it!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I purchased the Nexus 7 in Sept 2013 to replace my first generation Nexus 7.  Suffice it to say, I like the operating system, the screen, the logic, the connectivity.  However, last week (after 6 months) I took the Nexus out to use after being hooked up to a charger all night and it was dead.  I thought possibly a problem with the charger so I used another one that I had.  Dead.  Hmmm, I thought.  That's a rare event to have both chargers go bad at once.  But I ordered another charger and hooked it up.  Dead.  I got on the internet and found that the Nexus 7 has a problem with suddenly losing the ability to charge.  It apparently has something to do with the mini-usb connection.  So I downloaded a widget that monitors whether it is charging and discharging and plugged the Nexus 7 in.  Sure enough, it was discharging even though it was hooked up to the new charger.  So for 15 minutes I kept plugging and unplugging the unit until I finally got a connection that was charging at around 1,000 ma.  I had to move rooms.  I did not disconnect the mini-usb, simply unplugged.  When I replugged the charger in to a different outlet, it now only has 400 ma.  Go figure.  If this were an isolated event I could forgive.  But this is evidently a design flaw because I read of many people having this problem.  I would give the unit 4.5 stars other than this really significant issue."}

I have experienced no problems on this second unit, even before updating the unit.\n\nIf you own the original Nexus 7 and like the form factor consider making the upgrade as there is a considerable performance gap and the screen is leap years ahead in resolution and brightness.\n\nConsider getting the Moko Google New Nexus 7 FHD 2nd Gen Case.

Definitely worth paying extra to get one of these new ones with the higher resolution screen.  No more scrolling side to side to view the whole webpage.  This one was purchased for our 2yr old who mainly uses it for watching Netflix cartoons.  We can just hand him the tablet and he can unlock it and open/navigate Netflix himself.  He also uses it for some kids apps.  My wife and I will also use from time to time.\n\nMy wife was originally going to purchase one of those $100 kids tablets at the store that you have to pay an additional $20 for each cartridge.  She put it back when I told her we should buy him a Nexus 7 and get free apps.  This is also used by her sometimes and she loves it.  My son uses this way-way more than he ever would have used that $100 tablet.\n\nAlso bought this case to complete the \"kids tablet\" look and I definitely recommend this if it fits your application.....(i-Blason ArmorBox Kido Series for Google New Nexus 7 2 II)\n\nUpdate 7/24/2014:  Like the tablet very much.  My 2yr old did drop it once as he was trying to put it up on the counter and it locked up.  Held down power button for 30 seconds and it rebooted with no problems.  He is rough with it and that is the only time it had a slight issue so I am happy with quality.  I bought another because my 2yr old does not want to share (Netflix cartoon addiction).

Immediately, I went to search up this problem on the internet, and found out that I am not the only one in this position.\n\nAfter only having this product for 2 days, and using a screen testing app to find out where the dead pixels were, I found 6 blotches  of pixels in groups/clusters right next to each other, about the size of half a dime in width, where color was completely off, and even with a black screen, they attempt to show the colors of blue to green in a light hue.\n\nWhat flabbergasts me the most is the fact that I had only received this product 2 days ago, and I am already seeing dysfunctions in the quality of my screen.\n\n I hope I can get a replacement from Amazon quickly to deal with this, because even for a calm person such as myself with almost no OCD, I still get my eye drawn to the blotches of pixels that are displaying different colors than what they are supposed to show."}

Please do not get me wrong, I love Amazon with all my heart, that is why I buy almost everything here. It would also be a great purchase for the first time tablet user or for someone who is not very tech savvy for it has a cool feature called \"Mayday\" button that takes you to a live Amazon support individual on your tablet screen. It has good speakers if you do not plan on using headphones or ear-buds. It is also one of the only tablets that allows you to stream your free Amazon Prime videos.\n\n-I bought a Nexus 7 2013 version because I can always have the newest version of android when it becomes available first.\n\n-Google play has more than amazon does for apps. You can get the kindle app from Google play if you want to utilize your kindle library.\n\n-I do not have to unlock or try to manipulate the Nexus into trying to make an app work, they just do.\n\n-Chromecast is cool, so is Miracast that is on the Kindle. I just do not want to go out and buy a new television to be able to make Miracast work. We are PC gamers in this house so we do not have Playstations to run this through either.\n\n-I like having a front and back camera on the Nexus. Yes if you Skype a lot maybe you will want the 720p front camera on the kindle but you do not get a rear camera on the kindle.\n\n-The Nexus captures 1080P video, that is a cool tablet feature.\n\n-The kindle can be set up as child friendly. The Nexus can have multiple users. When you create a user profile you can you can restrict the mature content and set what applications that user will have access to. Not to mention the numerous apps available for helping the parent monitor and restrict if you deem this necessary it is all available on googleplay.\n\n-I like having the choice of what browser I want to use (firefox being my favorite) and I know that firefox works on just about every site. I also have the option of Google Chrome. I am not limited to just the kindle browser \"Silk\" which is not a horrible browser but I prefer knowing that when I use firefox under the right settings that I have a little privacy.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nWhat it boils down to is both of the tablets are great. Most of the time they are the same price. The kindle you will have to pay an additional fee if you do not want to see their adds every time you wake it up or unlock it. Most kindle users do not mind the adds and some like them. I have just found that for what I do the Nexus is a better buy for me. This is with the sacrifice of a little slower processor and video processor, I have not noticed any difference. If you are not in a huge hurry then maybe wait a little longer to see what the Nexus 8 is going to have besides a little larger screen. I believe that tablet is coming out sometime in 2014 (probably the 2nd or 3rd 1/4). Like I stated earlier I bought three of these and they are easy to set up and I have not had any problems in the last month of using them. I will gladly update this post/review if I do have any issues.\n\nI hope this review did not confuse you or make it harder for you to make a choice, the tablet is built by ASUS as well which this in itself is a bonus in my opinion.\n\nThanks for reading my review\n\nUPDATE/EDIT: 4/29/2014 Still running strong, all three of them. Love playing games on them and I love streaming Netflix in High Definition. Lots of rumors flying around out there about the Nexus 8. I still love my Nexus 7 2013 but I cannot wait to see what the next Nexus tablet has to offer.\n\nUPDATE/EDIT: 5/4/2015 The tablets are still operating just fine. Two of the three started having problems with the charging port. The charging port begins to get loose and sloppy. It will not charge after awhile. It is not that hard to fix if you do not mind opening up the back of the tablet and working with small tools. Eventually you can only bend things back into shape so many times before it fails. I did not bother buying a charging board replacement because they are expensive and there are two versions and you need the right one. I opted for a Qi wireless charging pad that I did a review on and it works great. Besides the charging port going bad the tablets have worked perfect.\n\nThanks for reading my review and this update."}

There are a lot of accessories for the tablet that my friend cant use on his ipad and mine is a lot cheaper. I don't like paying for the name.. I would recommend the Nexus 7 (2nd gen) to anyone. Thanks for the great product!!!!!"}

Charged it overnight on a working usb charger, but the machine just did not want to turn on no matter what I tried.  I am really disappointed for the fact that hardware built is bad that it only lasts about three months.  Who knows when my other machine goes down.  I want to buy a machine to replace the broken one, and I am not sure if I want another nexus."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "After looking in the tablet market for a couple weeks and looking through countless reviews I passed over the nexus 7 because of its humble price range and small size. No way could this $270 (32gb) tablet be a contender against galaxy tabs or I pads (not really a fan of apple) that were $400+! Then I saw some specs and reviews on various sites that blew my mind! Crazy fast processor, crystal clear screen, and stock android all packed into a 7 inch screen including front and back cameras! What more could you want? With Amazon's low price I was able to pick one up for around $250, which was possibly the best $250 I've ever spent. All good things about this tablet from the customisation to the blazing fast speeds to the vibrant display, Google sure has done it again with this 2013 model! Only complaint I could possibly have is no expandable memory in the form of an sd card slot but hey, the thing's $250 go get one, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I'm very happy with this tablet!  Had considered a Kindle Fire, but this has all the same good features, and none of the bad. All at $200 less!\n\n It is super fast, awesome display, and pretty easy to use. Its a bit of an adjustment if you're used to iOS, but very user-friendly.\n\nThe rear camera was a requirement for me, and the one on the Nexus 7 is just great. Comes with some basic photo editing software which is easy to use and makes for lovely pictures. You can also set multiple user accounts on the tablet, just like on a PC. So I can choose what apps my kids will have access to and what permissions they will have within the apps.\n\nThe speakers are pretty good, especially for a tablet. They ate louder and clearer than I expected. The screen is excellently clear and great for movies and games.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with this tablet and would not hesitate to recommend it to others."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I love my nexus 7, I really do, but I have to admit Apple products work with fewer glitches and there are more apps available. The 7 in size is perfect. The screen on the nexus is great. I love watching videos from YouTube or Netflix or other sources. I can even watch tv shows from my cable company. I frequently use facebook, twitter, and google and those apps and several others work quite well. I use yahoo mail and it has several flaws. One of my favorite games is Ruzzle and it frequently hangs on the nexus. I found instructions on the net to be able to view Amazon videos on Dolphin. It wasn't particularly easy to do but I accomplished it. It does seem like it has to be tweeked whenever the os is updated. I have an iPhone 5 and all the apps I use work fine and in many cases, slightly better than the nexus. I never tried to watch Amazon videos on the iPhone though.\n\nIf I had it to do over I would probably still buy the nexus because of the price difference. If money were no object, I would probably get the iPad. The other thing you should think about is if you've already purchased an extensive library of apps, music, movies, or TV shows on a phone or other device, you may not want to switch to another platform where you would have to repurchase everything."}

This tablet is beautiful, the screen is clear and crisp and it is lightning fast, I've yet to see it slow down or even hiccup while multi-tasking.\n\nCons:\nThe tablet had clearly been opened before I received it, even though it was marked new and the packaging even marked it as new.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I just bought - on many people's recommendations - this heap of rubbish.\n\nWhy do I say that? Well very simple. I'm over in the US from the UK and decided I'd like to get a tablet at last. I cannot fault the Amazon delivery system here one iota, as I got it two days after ordering. Very good, as I've come to expect with Amazon.\n\nWhat has really hacked me off is that I can't use the damn piece of cr*p. Why? Because I'm in a hotel room and it won't connect to the wifi!! It just gives me a warning that it can't connect to the web site. Doing some research (through the Google website of course) I find that others have had the same problem but unfortunately none of them could give me a coherent solution to fix it.\n\nNow this is the wonderful Google that I've lauded to the high heavens in regard to their search engine. Well let me tell you, on other Android experience, and now this, I think that's where they should stay. Rather leave this sort of thing to the professionals, because frankly, your silly named Jelly Bean or KitKat or whatever software is pathetic if it can't even connect to a hotel wifi.\n\nReally.\n\n24 March 2014 addition:\n\nOK, I've got home from the States and am still finding crap with this product. For a start the 'touchscreen' is certainly not that. Very unresponsive.\n\nAnd while I can just about manage the Lucky Fish (or whatever stupid name they've called the latest version) operating system on my htc phones, on the Nexus 7 it's useless. Coupled with another of Google's less-successful products, namely gmail, it's absolute rubbish. Talk about a couple of totally-unintuitive systems. To the extent that - while trying to impress my wife with my new purchase - I managed to completely delete an important email and have absolutely no idea where it went.\n\nI'll stick to - god strike me down for saying this - Windows and Yahoo mail.\n\nWhat a load of crap. I'll use it for doing Google searches - which got me to buy this thing in the first place - and NOTHING ELSE!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n30 March\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, I now find it doesn't support Flash Player so there's no way I can watch any videos on, for example, the BBC web site! For heaven's sake....."}

The display is stunning - as good as an iPad mini.  The user interface is responsive but scrolling is perhaps not quite as smooth as the iPad.  I was a bit disappointed by the battery life, which isn't the greatest - six hours on a charge is about all you can expect with GPS and WiFI enabled, checking email and watching videos.  All in all this is the best bang for your buck in a 7 inch tablet, at least as of this writing.\n\nHere's a warning - I left the supplied ASUS charger and micro-USB cable plugged in overnight (but fortunately the cable was not connected to the Nexus.)  When I woke up the next morning the micro-USB plug had literally melted, with plastic oozing out of the plug housing and through the plug itself.  Had the cable been plugged in it would have destroyed the Nexus USB connector.  I've seen several reports on the web of this scenario.  Until ASUS / Google does a recall or starts shipping a better cable my recommendation would be to avoid using the supplied cable for charging; either buy a good grade replacement cable or - even better - use a wireless charger."}

Even without a case it feels solid and easily gripped. Stock Android kit kat 4.4.2 is a pleasure to use, of course.\n\nI choose 5 stars because I really do prefer a stock android environment. Google gets it right! Hopefully more and more manufacturers clue in that it's really best to let android be android and to stop customizing their android products with crappy customizations like Samsung Touchwiz, Motoblur and HTC Sense. The bonus to Google running the show is you immediately get updates as Google pushes them out.\n\nThe nexus 7 is fast, and snappy. I experience zero lag when opening apps or even multitasking across apps. I've had this tablet since November 2013 and it still feels like new!  With 32 GB of space you'll also never run out of room for normal tasks such as reading ebooks, browsing online, listening to music, checking email or whatever.\n\nI would highly suggest this over most any other tablet in this price range for this same form factor of 7 inches."}

But, the real issue is that Asus can't fix the issue (I sent my tablet back twice) and they won't replace it.  So, I'm stuck with the best tablet could find, but from time to time it is useless.  Plug it into a power source and it works fine all the time.  But who wants a hardwired tablet?  Buy one, I'm sure yours will work fine now.  BUT, ASUS, I'M DONE BUYING YOUR PRODUCTS.

I buy the ones recommended for this particular unit, not a universal one.  After a short period of time, ( 2 months on average), the connection is too loose to charge  You have to move the cord around and hope to find a position in which it will make a connection.  As I said, I am on my third charging cord.  Having said that, the tablet itself is very good.  Had one issue with internet connectivity, contacted support, received a prompt reply and through a series of emails, I was able to correct the problem.

It has cool features like live wallpapers and can customize it more with widgets. But I mainly use my iPad mini still because the Nexus restarts itself frequently... It's very annoying and inconvenient. Sometimes I'm in the middle of reading, it restarts itself unexpectedly, so I have to figure out where I left off since I didn't have time to bookmark it. Sometimes I'm in the middle of writing an email, review, or Facebook post... It restarts and I lose everything.\n\nIf you want something reliable that you can count on, I wouldn't recommend this. It's okay as a back up or if I'm not doing anything important that can be unexpectedly interrupted."}

What about the older version of this tablet, or one with less memory, both of which could be had at SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper prices?\n\nAfter putting this model in the boys' hands during a test run at Best Buy, we were sold, and here's why:\n1) My boys use it to: play cheap-o apps from the app store, watch Netflix, surf the net to answer their own questions and research projects for school, chat and email with their friends, and video chat and email their grandparents.\n2) It's way cheaper than a similarly-equipped iPad mini.\n3) The aspect ratio is absolutely perfect for gaming and watching cartoons on Netflix.\n4) It is light as a feather, which makes it SUPER SUPER fun to play with.\n5) My husband was insistent that we buy the new Nexus model with Snapdragon.  His research suggested the boys' gaming experience would be the better for it.\n\nThere have been hangups.  For one, my iPhone family had to get used to Google Play.  And Google Hangouts, too, which sucks, but it works.  Also, we committed to accessory purchases that I would absolutely recommend to anyone buying this for a child:\n1) The BobJ cover, in their favorite color. (http://www.amazon.com/Bobj-Rugged-Nexus-Model-Tablet/dp/B00EMZC11K)\n2) Buying Funamo software for each device, at $19.99 a piece for a lifetime subscription (I do not work for Funamo in any way, just speaking from experience).  This software has so far provided us with flexible, excellent, and absolutely essential parental controls/child protection on their device.  The Nexus DOES NOT come equipped with any protection whatsoever to stop your 7-year-old from accidentally navigating to pornographic pictures while trying to bravely and independently google for answers about why he wets the bed AND I AM SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE HERE.  Funamo so far has provided us absolutely flawless internet-surfing protection.  For example, you can go to their Funamo Browser (AKA Chrome through a parental shield), type \"porn\" in the search engine, and it comes up with no results.  Funamo also allows you to restrict which apps the device can access and when, and to set time limits, like that the kiddos are only allowed to use their devices for 2 hours a day.\n\nI really can't express how phenomenally awesome these devices have been in our lives. With what limited time they are allowed to play on them, I have been so impressed at how the boys choose to use.  They beg me to schedule minecraft parties with their friends, where they all sit on the couch snuggled up and build things together in a shared virtual world.  They come up to me during their Nexus time and I see that they have been using Google Earth to chart a potential exploring adventure, or how to build a skateboard from scratch (which they actually did, with help from my husband).  Win win WIN."}

Read in google and decide for yourself...\n\nI don't know if it's a software issue or hardware, but me as a customer I should not worry about these things before I buy something, I only need a working device...\n\nBut...I do believe it's a software issue. Because after I restart it /reset settings, it works fine for two days and then it goes bizarre after that."}

And the screen resolution is fantastic!\n\nWARNING though, if you let the tablet battery die completely you will get the 5 white lights of death (or whatever people call it). I let mine get to about 7% then charge it fully. If it dies, you will likely panic when it takes an hour or so to finally turn back on after you place it on the charger.\n\nI laugh at people who spend hundreds more on Apple products.

The questions  and answers for this product said that by the time the battery quit charging, it would be time to get an updated machine.  But  I notice Amazon is selling this product and it is still current.  There is no cost effective way to replace the battery.  So my only other option is to replace the device. The problem is not only the cost of the device (for which I get no increased performance), but also all the data and apps on the device.  The real kicker is that I don't think the problem is that the battery won't hold another charge, but the plug on the tablet is defective.  It has always been quirky.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "After reading so many reviews and agonizing over which tablet to buy I am so happy with my decision. I realize that it is important to identify what features are most useful to you when deciding. I definitely wanted a smaller, more portable tablet that I could just throw into my bag. I also wanted an android platform and the fact that this one gets updated with the latest version was a top factor. I Love how it syncs with my PC and Android phone. I am not much for specs as they don't measure my personal satisfaction with things like screen satisfaction or speed. All I can say is that the screen clarity and color (are those even specs?) are great. Camera is great although I would not consider it my choice of device for digital pictures. I leave that to my Canon Digital camera which is great or my smart phone Samsung Galazy S4mini when on the go. I don't play games so no opinion on that. Great for watching movies/videos. One downside-does not support Amazon Prime movies (I wonder if this is intentional as the Fire is a worthy competitor). I got the 32G although I don't think I will ever come close to capacity. I have cloud storage so it really isn't a factor to me anyway. If you are an apple enthusiast..then go for it since you won't be happy unless you have that logo.

I use it every day (and I also have a Nexus 10; Kindle Fire; and my family owns an iPad); I found a great deal on the new Nexus 7, so I decided to finally go for it.\n\nThe improvements are easily worth the price. Even if the price difference is a hundred dollars, the screen alone is seriously worth the upgrade. It really is NIGHT AND DAY.\n\nWhen I'm watching an HD video with the new Nexus 7, it doesn't feel like I'm looking at a screen. There is so much more detail, it looks like you're actually there, and the contrast is EASILY better that the colors really pop.\n\nHolding it in the hands feels so much better too. The weight is very noticeable and thinner. Everything about it just cleaner - it really makes the old feel fat and heavy, as thin and light as it was.\n\nPros vs first generation:\n- Fantastic sharp screen - More detail and colors really pop! (1920x1200 323ppi vs 1280x800 216ppi)\n- Feels much better in the hands - lighter - much more pleasant experience\n- Faster processor and runs much smoother\n- Speakers really do sound better\n- Backside camera\n\nWhat would make the Nexus tablets even better is if it had a SD or microSD slot; but you can get a micro USB host cable and the Nexus Media Importer App.\n\nPersonally, I would go for the 32GB because the 16GB really is easily going to limit you in the long run with the installed apps and such.\n\nAgain, I own the Nexus 10 and first generation Nexus 7, but I'm still VERY impressed by the 2nd generation Nexus 7. I love it and I would not hesitate at all and can confidently recommend the new one over the first one. Technology really amazes me.\n\nThis is definitely a must-have for any tech gadget lover."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I've had this tablet since January 8, 2014 and I have been loving it since day one! Set up was a breeze. Once I signed into my pre-existing Google account, my email, contacts and calendar were synced almost instantly and without a hitch or a glitch. Therefore, getting organized was a snap! Even the latest operating system update was pushed to my device almost as fast. So, I will assume that prior glitches, as reported elsewhere here, were resolved with the latest update that was pushed to me. Because, happily, I have no such glitches or problems to report. NOTE: My personal Nexus 7 2013 is WIFI only. However, there are, or will be, units coming out soon that are both WIFI and 4G LTE compatible. Perhaps even by the time you read this.\n\nThere are two things I'd like to point out here. This tablet is fragile. So, save yourself some worry and buy a good case (with or without a stand) and a pack of screen protectors to go with this. Also, I am an avid eBook reader who, prior to getting this, used a Kindle Paperwhite to read with. Moving eBooks from Kindle to Nexus 7 2013, to read, can be a bit tricky. However, it is really not difficult. Simply sync Google drive (or Dropbox) to the Nexus 7. Then, download Moon Reader eBook reader from the Play Store (There are two versions, free and paid, available. The free version should do nicely for most people) Put any books you'd like to read into the Google Drive (or Dropbox) folder on your PC. Then, on the Nexus 7, select Moon Reader, then My Files, then GDrive (Google Drive) or Dropbox. You will then see a list of the books you put in the folder on your PC. Simply tap the name of the book you want, from the list on the Nexus 7, and it will automatically upload to the Nexus and be ready to read. As I said, tricky, yes. But, the process does get easier once you've done it a time or two. I highly recommend this tablet to anyone. Buy with confidence and enjoy!"}

In January, less than 2 and half months later, it no longer will boot.  ASUS  said to return the tablet for them to look at and fix or replace.  I'm glad they're going to stand behind it, but come-on, shouldn't it last longer than that for the amount you have to pay for it!  Maybe I got the exception, so I guess I have to give them the benefit of the doubt."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "First off, just want to make it clear I am NOT a technically inclined person. That being said, I still did my homework before choosing a tablet. This one got pretty high ratings by a couple of the most common tech review websights out there. The main reasons I went with the Nexus 7 is first, I really wanted one of the smaller sized tablets for easy portability and even in its' case this fits the bill. Second, and most important, I like the android operating system better for the fact you aren't bound to buying books, movies, etc...on iTunes only. I considered the Kindle for its' price & features as well, but again, bound mostly to Amazon & more added content/advertisements then I wanted(sorry Amazon)...thirdly, the price was definitely right for all the features you get!! And lastly, I've been very pleased with the video/sound quality, & ease of use. It comes right out of the box ready to use, and even though I'm not a techie, I've been able to figure applications out easily through Google's help pages. The only small negative I would say, is that the charging cord is too short--say if you're using it while having it plugged in & you haveto because you didn't get it charged before you wanted to use it& your battery is low :) but that's very minor in the over all picture. For the price point & features, I've been very pleased with my Nexus 7!! I'd highly reccomend this tablet to those looking for one in this category/price point."}

The whole Google integration is not the good compared to Apple. Very disappointing. I don't like Apple's overpricing and over-hyping, forget about comparing hardware and try the software first.

The screen has held up great, and operating system has proven rock solid, and the apps, of course, are abundant.\n\nOne worry I had was if the tablet's battery completely drained. Would it seriously degrade the battery?  Thankfully, when that day finally happened (and it will) I found no change in the battery life once it recharged.\n\nAnother thing I kept assessing during the first few months was whether I would buy one for my luddite wife, the one who knows how to browse and that's about it. The one who currently has an iPhone 4S.  I took a chance after she really liked mine (vs. going with an iPad Mini) and bought one for her, too. Good call.\n\nIt's light, and if you want to keep it light be mindful of the case/cover you buy for it. I didn't make such a good choice there.\n\nI still believe this to be the best 7-inch tablet available, and the best value."}

Everything my original Nexus 7 did, the 2013 version does better. The new HD screen is just beautiful. The rear camera while not great, is still very useful and takes decent pictures. The Snapdragon Processor is much faster than the Tegra 3 Processor inside the original N7 uses. Battery life seems very similar between the 2 tablets.

The main issue for me, however, is the screen sensitivity, particularly when typing. I often use my Nexus to type things, and the keyboard constantly lags and is very inaccurate. All other precision-based gestures are difficult as well, such as web browsing- the screen rarely responds how I wish it would. This really bothers me.

After that, they told me that they would have to charge e a restocking fee after they decided if something was wrong with the item. Then,, after a three weeks of waiting, they email me stating that they can't accept the return because the charger isn't the correct one even though I never took the charger out of the box. I contacted Amazon right away and they are currently helping me to sort this whole mess out.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I've owned this tablet for about 4 months now, and I believe I have a good grasp of it. Out of the box, you get the tablet, an AC charger, and a micro USB cable. The AC charger is superior to the Nexus 7 2012 charger, because it is smaller, square, and doesn't fall off the wall charger like it'd predecessor. The micro USB cable is the same as the Nexus 2012 charger, which are light and sleek, but my micro USB connector has popped out of the plastic a few times, which is an easy fix to snap back in, but is tedious when it happens.\n\nHardware:\nThe tablet itself is very light, which is nice if you want to hold it in one hand, but it is large enough to play android games comfortably. When the Tablet originally came out, people were having touch troubles with the screen, but that has since been resolved, and there hasn't been any major issues. This tablet is 7 inches, which is big enough to not strain your eyes when looking at the screen, but small enough to fit snugly in my pockets. The screen of the tablet is an 1900x1200 IPS display, which means that it can go anywhere with sunlight and still be clearly seen, and to see the smallest of details that most tablets for this price skimp. This is great for reading books or playing games outside. There are three hard buttons on the right side of the tablet: Power, Up and Down, and three soft buttons: Back, Home, and Multitask. This device has 2gb of Ram and a snapdragon S4 1.5ghz processor which makes multitasking very easy, and apps smooth. This Nexus has a front and rear (5MP) camera which is a great improvement over its predecessor. The stereo speakers allow you to hear clearly when playing music or videos without needing headphones. Hardware wise, this tablet is great, light, and powerful.\n\nUpdate 1/22/14:\nPeople that has reviewed this product has said that the fact that no micro sd card slot was a major negative. Although this is correct, you can add an OTG (On the Go) cable to this tablet and it will work fine. From there, you have to decide if you want to root your tablet or not.\n\nMy recommendation for which one to buy is from Meenova (not sold on amazon). They sell a \"Mini MicroSD Card Reader\" which is used on my Nexus 7. Unfortunately, they do not have a store on Amazon yet, so you'll have to Google it.\n\nI am not affiliated any way with the above people, but I will definitely say that my 64gb micro SDHC card works great with Poweramp, and every emulator I've used.\n\nSoftware:\nThis tablet is backed by Google Play, which is a great platform for free apps, and the paid apps are great. If you can think of an app, Google play probably has a free version with ads, great for students like myself trying to use a tablet on a budget.\n\nOverall:\nI use this tablet every single day. As a music player, a grocery list, a game console. I take it wherever I go, and I'd probably be lost without it. I would recommend this tablet to anyone who is interested in a tablet, especially at its price point @ $269 when I bought it, and deals are constantly online for much less.\n\nPros:\n+ Price is great compared to similar tablets.\n+ Screen size is large but portable\n+ 1900x 1200 IPS screen enables to see tablet wherever you are without seeing pixels\n+ 2gb Ram and Snapdragon S4 processor for easy multitasking\n+ Backed by Google Play's market.\n+ Front and Rear cameras\n\nCons:\n- Charger cord's connector sometimes comes loose, requires plastic to be reattached."}

This is so much more convient for travel, especially on planes.  I find it to be just big enough to watch movies or read books on and easy to stow and get out.  I can easily slide it into the pocket of my sweatpants.  Also a big fan of Android and wanted to try the Nexus line with its promise of timely updates.  No complaints or regrets as Android developers improve the number and quality of tablet apps."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I chose the Google Nexus 7 tablet because I trusted the Google brand, the price was right, and the reviews looked positive.\nI had a friend who had bought one in late 2012 and had various problems with his, but figured his was a lemon.\nNope, the problems are pretty widespread, it seems. If you do a quick search online you'll see that I'm not the only person with ongoing issues with charging. The problems started when the charger stopped working. I would plug it in and nothing would happen. This caused the battery to completely drain out, which then messed up the system somehow. I checked with Google support to do a \"hard\" reboot and that started it up, but the charger still only actually worked about 1/3 of the time. That slowly turned into about 5%--and I noticed that it would lose power even when it showed it was charging, so something else was wrong. It would be plugged in, show the \"charging\" signal, but I could sit there and watch it lose power a percentage point at a time. At this point I thought maybe the charger was broken, and I bought a new one on Amazon. This one didn't work any better.\nGoogle said it wasn't covered by warranty and I should refer to the store where I bought it. The store said I needed to contact ASIS. I had a hell of a time getting in touch with Asis, who then said that I had voided the warranty by using this second charger and not just the charger that came with the device.\nMan, oh man.\nSo, my Google Nexus has been sitting on my shelf, \"charging\" for several weeks now, but will only occasionally turn on just long enough for it to ask me to plug in my charger and then shut itself off.\nI do not recommend the Google Nexus. Better to spend a little bit more and get a product from a company with a proven history of quality and customer service."}

I use this to primarily read books, emulate PSX and SNES, and just browse in when I don't want to lug out my laptop.  If the memory is an issue, just buy a micro USB connector with a USB 2.0 on the other end, a flash reader, and microUSB of your choice (I went with a 64GB) to switch out files, games, music, movies, etc if you are a media user like myself.  It comes compatible so you can just literally plug'n'play\n\n  I do suggest skipping the tiny keyboards you could potentially get with a tablet because personally my hands are clumsy and a bit large to use the thing.  May be more useful for the more dextrous user.

I use it primarily for surfing the web and playing games with a little bit of work related tasks here and there.  Since I already have a Galaxy Note 3 and use Google related products to manage my life, the nexus fits in quite well, giving me another touch point to manage my calendar, tasks, email, etc.\n\nThe size is the biggest pro...large enough to make reading emails, books and other documents easy on the eyes, but still small enough to throw into a pocket without creating the burden on something else to carry.  For example I am volunteer firefighter and used to take my iPad with me to monthly meetings.  Unfortunately I dropped it from the truck once when carrying all my gear to the truck (didn't break or anything, but it could have).

My biggest gripe is with the sound/power keys. They practically lay on top of each other. This makes adjusting the volume a task that you must focus on - with a clumbsy or absent minded finger, you're more likely to shut the screen off than turn the volume up.\n\n2. The camera is always under my thumb when I pick it up. I'm not sure how. But, somehow, the placement of the camera makes it a prime target to be fingerprinted as I lift the tablet from the table.\n\n3. The speakers are unimpressive. I hate that the Nexus 7 must be paired with a Bluetooth speaker in order to be heard while in the shower. That said, the Bluetooth pairing is painless.\n\nOtherwise, fantastic machine.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "The Nexus 7 is a well-built tablet with a gorgeous display. The super high dpi screen is beautiful, and a pleasure to use. It comes with Android 4.4 Kit Kat, which is delightful to use. The processor is powerful enough for apps to run fluidly without a hitch. Sound quality is excellent, and it is a comfort to hold up.\n\nWHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS\nPersonally, I like to customize my devices a lot. Thus, I always buy Nexus devices, which will have the greatest support from the dev communities and will always get newest updates to ROMs first. For people who love trying out new stuff, a Nexus device (or any other AOSP-device) is a great choice. Battery life for the tablet is also pretty good. On heavy use, the battery can last an entire day.\n\nISSUES\nAs some others have noted, there are teething issues with the touch. I noticed that my drags are sometimes paused and cut off, though i didn't notice any phantom tap issues. Having rooted it and moved on to CyanogenMod, the issues have gone away, and even if you do not follow these steps, as others have noted, there are fixes for this.\n\nOVERALL\nThis is a solid 7\" tablet with a very decent selling price.

The nexus crashes a lot, and doesn't have quite the selection of good free apps that the IPAD has. However, I really like the size, it actually does fit into the inside pocket of my jacket. It is very portable and the screen is still big enough to watch netflix on. I love the fact that it is only half the price of the IPad, so I'm not quite so scared of breaking it."}

On the Android side of things, I have owned a Motorola Xoom, a Samsung S3 (rooted), a cheap Taiwan knockoff. My experience with Android hasn't been very good, and my main gripes are:\n\n- Android ecosystem is not as good as iOS, especially apps\n- Android gives you that flexibility to do with your device whatever you wanted, but in return, it is easier for malware to creeping, and software problems can be very painful. All of my Android devices have suffered from device frequent reboots that can only be solved by factory reset\n\nRecently I bought Nexus because I was looking for a 7' tablet but didn't feel like an iPad mini. Compared this against Samsung and finally settled on this because of the stellar reviews and cheap price.\n\nLove:\n\n- device is light and so portable\n- battery life is the best amongst all devices I have used so far. The fact that it is WiFi only means that it doesn't use battery as much as LTE devices, but bottom line is that there is no complains in the battery section\n- smooth as butter. As good as any iDevice, if not better, and by far the best in Android device that I have used and tested in stores (that includes most Samsung devices, Sony and Asus)\n- stable: though I load many of the same software that has caused problems with my other Androids, I have experienced no crashes. I was more careful this time, given my bad experience with Android, but it is still a lot of software loaded. So far so good\n- better integrated: data sharing between apps is just so much better than iDevices\n- screen: very nice and crisp. One of the best if not the best\n- sound: very good for a tablet, and surprisingly loud too\n- camera: didn't really try - never believed in taking photos using tablet\n- charging: fast. More than what it takes to charge iPhones but nowhere near iPads\n- cheap for its specs: compared to Samsung and iPad\n\nGripes:\n- almost all Android devices support SD expansion card, and it is also a strong plus point compared to iDevice, so I consider Nexus omission of one a big negative point\n- I still think the iOS app ecosystem superior\n\nNevertheless, the Nexus has replaced the iPad as my primary device"}

I downloaded and opened a PDF file with no problem.\n\nI am still trying to figure out all the stuff I can do with the camera, which is front and rear facing.

I'm gonna get straight to the point of all the things wrong with my device. Touch screen is selective on the apps and function buttons. At first the \"settings\" icon was working well. I thought I was able to set up my N7 how I wanted it. I attempted to adjust the mouse/cursor because it was extremely sensitive when typing. But it only got worse. The lock screen doesn't unlock easily. It takes a few tries to finally unlock the screen. I have a gazillion notifications at the top screen which I'm unable to check using the notification shortcut. I am unable to set up Google Now because the \"next\" tab is not functioning.  The email icon is not working. Let's just put it this way....about 90% of my icons aren't working properly. I click and click on them and nothing happens. I can't even get to the default apps since they aren't on my home screen and \"my apps\" icon doesn't work.\n\nI did some further research once I noticed all these issues. It seems N7 2013 requests an update and that update destroys a working device causing long presses, double clicks and losing track of touch/finger.\n\nI just received this device today. Obviously I opened it up immediately and began setting it up. It was to my dismay to discover I have a non-working device. I have no other choice but to return the device. I'm debating on exchanging for another N7 or select another device, such as a Samsung Tab or Kindle Fire."}

I have had this happen with Android and iOS devices, so no big deal. But when it came back on, it froze on the lock screen. Then it rebooted itself again, and again, and I realized it was stuck in a boot loop (always restarting without ever fully turning on). I shut it off, but then it did not come back on at all. I looked up online, and saw that you could try charging it for an hour, and when that did not work, charge it over night. None of that worked. I tried not charging it for a few days to let the battery die and see if it would come back up, but still nothing. Plugging it into the computer would not show a device attached. So I had a nice brick instead of a $269 tablet!\n\nI figured I was within thirty days to try an exchange, but it was a third party seller (not Amazon directly).

There are a few cons, but the pros outshine them so very, very well.\n\nPros:\n- This, by far, is one of the most heavy-duty tablets I've ever tried. As soon as I got it online, it updated to Kitkat and that's really great. It could take practically all the heavy games I could put on it and most of the apps I ran on it worked perfectly.\n\n- The screen size is actually just right. At first, I thought it'd be too small, but after using it for a week, it was pretty much just right for my needs. My lecture files read perfectly, and even drawing on it is pretty smooth.\n\n- The glass is strong, all right. I wasn't able to place a screen protector so I used it for a week without one. After a little cleaning with a microfiber towel, the tablet looked as good as new. Not a scratch in sight.\n\n- Movies look splendid on it, especially in HD.\n\n- Wifi is really fast. It connects to our school wifi no problem and runs the net at very good speeds.\n\n- Transferring files is a breeze after getting Nexus Media Importer from Google Play. There may be no SD card slot, but with NMI I can attach practically any USB drive to it.\n\nCons:\n- I noticed that after playing really heavy games (i.e. Little Inferno or #Sworcery), the tablet heats up at the area of the camera/power button really, really fast. It's not just \"warm,\" it's really hot. Not painfully hot, but hot nonetheless. Gameplay of around 30 minutes already causes it to heat up. It's made me stop playing these heavy games for extended periods of time.\n\n- That's pretty much all I can complain about. This tablet is great and I'd recommend it to practically anyone."}

Well Google teaming up with Android and Asus to build their tablet was one of the best things to happen in the tablet industry. I use my tablet for everything, it has a camera on the front for Skyping or for Conference Calls which is fantastic. It is set up just like an Android phone so it is very familiar to use if you have an Android phone. The HD screen resolution is the best in the market - it even beats the Apple iPad mini. The wide edges on the top and bottom of the tablet are great for viewing videos (or anything when you have the tablet horizontal) because you can hold on to the edges without blocking any of the screen. The best part, is if you have a Gmail account - you can use your Google Drive to always be able to access your documents without having to store them on the tablet, so really the amount of memory on your tablet isn't a huge factor in its ability to accomplish what you need. I am a tech geek, and I work in the Information Technology Industry (at UPS in software development), and I can assure you that more and more things will be stored in the cloud instead of physically stored on your device, don't be fooled by other tablets who claim to have much more memory as if you need it; it really doesn't matter. The Nexus7 (2013) also updates it's software and operating system automatically so you will not be stuck with an old operating system and need to buy a new tablet.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I've had a kindle for awhile; just books, nothing else. I'd been thinking about upgrading to a tablet, but was hesitant because I thought I'd never use it. But I started looking anyway, and narrowed it down to this one and the Kindle Fire HDX. Now I have a macbook pro, an iPod, and a droid phone. So I really have no bias on iOS or Android; they both have their moments. But with the solid specs of these two tablets, I didn't want to shell out the extra dough for an iPad mini with basically the same specs. Plus, I knew I'd want customization and widgets on my tablet, and iOS simply doesn't like that  Anyway...I ended up choosing the Nexus because I liked the customization options of stock android, and I didn't want to commit to amazon prime (which I would want to use the kindle hdx to its fullest extent.)\n\nI love this thing. I've had it for about a week now, and its just awesome. First of all, it's beautiful. The screen is amazing. I didn't expect to see a big difference between this and my relatively-new phone, but I was pleasantly surprised. Like some have said, you've just got to see it.\nI am using this thing quite a bit, for stuff all across the board. Its great for reading (my kindle hasn't gotten much use) and I can hold it in one hand quite easily. Its also great for videos (I've used YouTube, Netflix, and HBO GO with no problems.) I've also been using it for news. Google newsstand is good, but I downloaded flipboard and love it. Gaming is great too.\nOverall I am incredibly pleased with this little guy, and though I was hesitant about getting a tablet, I am happy with my decision.\nIf you're on the fence about getting a tablet, and half a couple hundred dollars to spend, I would suggest giving the nexus 7 a try (I got the 32 GB, but we'll see if I'll actually need the extra storage. For only $40 more, what the heck, right?) . Even if I had a larger budget, I think I still would've gone with this tablet. IMHO, apples a great company with solid products, but they have to stop acting like they still own the tablet game. I think they should lower their prices to be realistic with their competitors. But they have a very loyal fan base who will buy anything just because its apple ( which is totally fine, more power to them) but this was a choice that I'd make again and again, no regrets."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I got this because I was tired of the 10\" Transformer Prime. It was not good for playing games or anything else. It was only good for watching video but too big for everything else. Plus the prime had a performance problem because it only had like 768mb of RAM. So I decided I wanted something smaller. I for the new Nexus 7. Screen resolution is INSANE !!! Best on the market and it is fast as hell. It plays anything I throw at it perfectly.\n\nNow here is why I refunded it. 2 HUGE problems. #1) It intermitently would not get past the load screen, I would let it sit for hours and it would be stuck. Then I would force power it off and on next boot or 3 boots after since sometimes it would still be stuck, it would boot all the say but I would get data corruption and force close errors all over the place. This has happened 4 times since having it. The only workaround is to reset it back to factory defaults.  That is UNACCEPTABLE. I lose all my files and settings and apps when I do that. #2) There was a nasty screen problem when I would touch it to do anything. It would only recognize like every 2 touches. I would do anything and it would not register the 3rd touch. When doing normal stuff like surfing the internet or going through the gallery, it was annoying but when I would game on it, it would be unacceptable to me. It made playing games frustrating and impossible.\n\nKeep in mind, I did NOT alter the stock software. Did not root it, did not load any custom kernels or roms and I updated it to the latest software patch and same issues.\n\nI was thinking of exchanging it thinking I just had a defective one but then I read on forums how other people have the same exact issue and exchanged theirs 2, 3, even 4 times before they actually got one that worked the way it was suppose to.\n\nSo apparently the way these were made, was very cheap in a way where some of them were going to be defective off the product line. No quality control whatsoever. So I decided to refund it and got a LG G Pad 8.3\n\nI would NOT recommend the Nexus 7 2nd generation to ANYONE !!! But the 1st generation, go right ahead."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "7 May 2014: Thanks to Google's omission of full USB OTG function, file transfers are frustrating & sometimes impossible. When I return home, I'm rooting it.\n\nAfter 24 hours, I like it. It's a little different from my Galaxy Player 5 inch. The extra processor speed is nice. So is the combination of the light weight and larger screen. The GP5 was getting bogged down by software bloat. It fits nicely in my old K3 case. So far, so good.\n\n...and it works with my Targus Bluetooth keyboard. Actually, it works better than it does with the GP5. The Samsung has some key-mapping problems, probably due to Gingerbread.\n\nAs to reading, I happened to be starting a novel the other day, and started it on the Nexus 7. I had no problem. I did keep the brightness on 'Auto', so the light level of the screen matched the ambient light. With the GP5, matching light levels was a little chancy, so I had a bit more eyestrain. (Of course the extra 2\" of screen have no bearing on that, right?)\n\nI did try the freebie 'La Luna' video that Google gives away. It watched fine on the 7\" screen. The thing I really like is that there is a 7\" screen in the weight of a past-technology 5\" package. I owned a Nook color for 13 days, but took it back because of the weight and balance. It just wasn't comfortable to hold.\n\nI haven't tried any significant music listening. I suspect I'll still prefer my Clip+ for that. The Nexus is a little large for that purpose. I also haven't tried the camera in any particular serious way. A selfie and a picture of my cat isn't much of a trial.  Again, I'll probably use a purpose-made camera for real pictures. I also haven't explored portability yet. In the case, it's a bit bulky for easy transport, whereas the GP5 fits in my pocket next to my cell phone. I probably won't put the N7 in my pocket without a case. It's a little large and fragile seeming for that.\n\n...As to the camera, it's OK, the image quality is fine, but a 7\" tablet just isn't a good ergonomic platform for picture taking. This is the best from an afternoon at Mass Audubon's Ipswich River Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\nPicture is available at:\nMobileRead Forums > E-Book Readers > Android Devices>Nexus 7 2013 1st Impressions\n\n...And I still prefer my Clip+ for music. I hand to hunt around the Android store for a decent player for my collection which includes WMAs as well as MP3s. Google does not play WMAs (cue prissy, superior sniff). I settled on Poweramp, not because it was perfect, but because it was the first one I came to that was good enough. I just want to listen to some music, people, not commit my soul to a single, ringing, crystalline-pure music player that rules them all. Sheesh.\n\nSomeday I may do a better review, too. All of the usual things about tablets are at worst adequate on the N7.\n\nOh, one piece of free advice, worth every penny you paid: Don't go hog wild buying really great accessories. Shop around. A $3 wire easel from a craft store will make a fine desk stand. I have one at work and one at home. A chopstick and a binder clip will do in a pinch. Also, there are good $10 EVA zip cases that will protect your N7 for transport. They don't have to be purpose built. My old K3 had a case that loosely fits the N7 (freebie!) and my KPW1 lives in a similar case. As to ear buds, the candy-colored $5 ones in the bin at the cash register at WalGreens are my favorite, and you never misplace them, because candy-colored."}

I wanted something that I could use while on a bus and reading news articles or email, plus playing some minor games. I wanted to stick with the Android ecosystem since I already own an Android phone, plus I don't particularly like Apple. The Nexus 7 called to me, as it was a high resolution Nexus device (no worries about bad OEM skins and the like), plus it was far cheaper than the Nexus 10.\n\nSIZE:\nThe size is pretty much perfect for me. My pant pockets tend to be rather long, so my Nexus 7 actually fits in my pocket. Usually, I keep it in my jacket pocket instead and tether my cell phone in order to browse the Internet while taking the bus to work. I think of it as having a paperback book with me, only substantially more useful.\n\nSCREEN:\nSimply beautiful. High resolution\n\nBATTERY LIFE:\nWith heavy use, I usually get about two days of battery life on it; with more typical-for-other-people use, it is more like a week to a week and a half.\n\nPERFORMANCE/WIFI:\nI have no complaints about the performance of my Nexus 7. In fact, my sole complaint is with the defect in the 5 GHz antenna on the device; it will randomly shut off after connecting to a 2.4 GHz network until you reboot the tablet.

I was amazed how much different just 1 inch of tablet size felt.  The Nexus is also lightweight yet extremely high quality and this was very important for me.  My Ipad isn't any higher quality and the extra weight leads to more damage if it gets dropped.  Not the other way around.  In fact I watched some \"drop tests\" on Youtube and the Nexus was the only one I saw that when dropped didn't break the screen.  Though I would call this lucky, the best protection is obviously a case.\n\nThen there is the screen.  I was like Retina who??  It literally surpasses my Ipad in everyway.  If you want the best screen the Nexus 7 is for you, if you are just an easy sell by fancy names then maybe the Ipad is for you.  There is nothing bad about my Ipad it just isn't as good.  Every Apple product I own is just hype and marketing, based on my experience\n\nThe last thing is the Nexus 7 is fast.  It has not hiccupped even one time since I've had it.

Apps also don't quite work as well as on the iPad. You have almost too many choices on Android and the apps tend to be not as polished. The big, popular apps are not at issue. If you mostly use apps like Facebook, Twitter, Google apps, etc. you have nothing to worry about.\n\nI use my Nexus 7 mostly to read, and to watch streaming video every so often. For those purposes, the Nexus 7 can't be beat. The screen is great and it is a joy to read on the Nexus 7.\n\nI tried playing a few games as well and I have no complaints. The games ran smoothly. I can't get used to playing games using touchscreen controls though so I don't really play anything besides Angry Birds, Solitaire, Bejeweled Blitz and a couple of driving games.\n\nI would have given it 5 stars except for the lack of accessories and it can be a bit tough to navigate through the app store. I was thinking maybe I should give it 5 stars since this is not really the fault of the device itself - it's a great device but I do think the ecosystem matters as well."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I have been hearing so many good things about this tablet, and android KitKat, that I finally purchased one.\nThe resolution of the screen is beautiful, snapdragon processor is snappy,and Kit Kat brings some nice albeit minor changes to android.\nThat's where my love affair with Nexus 7 ends. Two major issues plagued the 32GB version of the tablet:\nFirst the keyboard and multi-touch have a problem. When using the built in Google virtual keyboard, most of the time I would get the wrong character or additional characters from what I typed. This was most problematic when trying to log in to a site with my password as I kept getting an error that my account and password did not match.. That's because the keyboard was adding additional letters to the ones I typed.  For example, instead of \"Password\" it would add characters or type wrong ones so I would get something like \"] PPasddewoerdd\"\nI also had issues with wifi connectivity for Internet based apps and streaming content where I would get an error message \"APP has stopped suddenly\" or I would just get thrown out of a video.\nAnother pet peeve of mine is the large bezel at the bottom of the screen which made a 7\" screen look smaller than tablets with more of an edge to edge design.\nI have returned it and am sticking with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 8 inch, which has proven very reliable. The slim design and additional useable screen real estate of the Tab3 8.0 outshines the overall performance of the new Asus designed Nexus 7.\nMaybe I got a defective one, but from some Web searches the problems seem somewhat widespread, and apparently Google is aware of the issues but have yet  to issue an update to fix them.  Disappointed that performance didn't measure up to all the accolades of the tech media who seem to be in love with Google and Apple and extra critical of perhaps the industry's most innovative performer, Samsung."}

I use it to check my mail and just about anything i could do with it.\n\nit is worth saying that I haven't updated to the latest version of android (4.4 kitkat) at the moment i am making the review. im running 4.3 because i was kinda lazy to flash a new recovery. but having said that it kinda didn't matter since most of the things that i liked about kitkat was exclusive to nexus 5.\n\nSpeed + Multitasking\ndont let that old processor fool you, I couldn't intentionally make it slow. i had 3 games running (well 1 on the screen and 2 others hidden) and it was just for experiment I switched from one game to another and it handled it like a BOSS. to name the three games its real racing 3, Deer Hunter and D-Day. so as you would imagine if it could handle that 1 video on mobo floating around while you browse the web and/or check mail would be a walk in the park.\n\nHardware\nscreen is still nice i didn't change the kernel. the buttons are still there and i always click the volume buttons because well i like clicking them a lot, i couldn't say the same to the lock button because i have a magnetic cover that shuts the screen off and turns it on when its covered and opened respectively but the button works. in everyday use i didn't feel like it was too hot to handle or overheating even when its hot inside the train. the screen is really bright probably too bright if theres no light on. if theres reflection i could still see the contents of the screen.\n\nSpeakers\ni know that a lot of people were saying good things about the boom sound and front facing speakers but these speakers on this thing is pretty good as well. its not too loud that when you're out and about and you wanted to show something to your friends and theres vehicles passing by its hard to hear from the speakers. if its indoors theres no problem with it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "Overall the Nexus 7 (2013 edition) WIFI ONLY is an awesome value. It packs a power punch in the CPU/GPU department. What I dislike about it are the hardware power and volume buttons I feel like if I press them too much they'll get stuck, plus they are a bit awkward to find if you're grasping for it in low light situations. Also, about 25% of the time using the tablet with your fingers it won't register some touch presses. I recently picked up a Truglide stylus and that seems to mitigate those issues completely. Also, the camera is pretty basic I wouldn't buy this tablet for the camera capability. On a really good note, battery life, even after full use during the day is OUTSTANDING. I use the tablet to stream spotify or pandora on a daily basis and when I'm using it as a display screen for photography at full brightness battery performance does not dissappoint. Screen resolution is phenomenal!! I use eyefi and dropbox for some photography work and for some hobby shooting, so yes using the Nexus 7 as a second display is perfect."}

I was very surprised when comparing it to my Note 10.1 2014.\n\nThe general build quality is pretty good, one of the best for an Android tablet. The soft rubber feeling is nice. Its got a suprising weight, but isn't overly heavy. Its fairly well balanced, if a bit top-heavy.\n\nThis tablets real world performance is very smooth. Stock it only benchmarks at around 5500 (Quadrant) while my Note 2014 is around 25,000. Real world performance however, its much smoother. And boy-o-boy once I unlocked/rooted/installed custom rom (cleanrom 2.6) it really screams. Doubled my benchmark score and I cant find a hint of lag/stutter anywhere.\n\nThe screen is sharper, colors were much more natural (better whites and blacks too). Holding this next to the Note 2014 the whites are so much whiter, and the screen is brighter.\n\nI didn't think a 7 inch tablet would be able to be good for much, but again I was wrong. Reading PDFs is easy so long as they are a good 10-12 font. Highlighting is pretty easy too.\n\nIts nice getting the latest updates from Google. 4.4.2 is a nice OS. ART cache offer a bit of a performance boost is you don't want to root and flash your tablet.\n\nBattery life is decent. Stock its around 2 days, rooted and custom rom (plus DS battery saver+setcpu) its about 3 days.\n\nMy Note 2014 is being returned. This tiny beast is here to stay."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "Pros: Good price, excellent display, fast, good size\n\nCons: No external SD card slot, navigation buttons take up some of the display\n\nThis second iteration of the Nexus 7 is pretty good and improved upon a lot of the shortcomings with the first one. The screen is very sharp and displays colors accurately. The resolution is very good for a 7\" display. Text, images, and video all look good on it.\n\nThe size is also pretty good; it fits comfortable in my hand, but might be a little big for someone with smaller hands. One thing I don't like about the Nexus 7 is how the navigation buttons at the bottom actually take up some of the 1920x1200 display, so you lose some of the screen real estate. It's not a big deal, but the actual usable area is smaller. I think they went with this implementation so the buttons re-orient when you flip the screen.\n\nThe battery is above average. I'm not a heavy user, but I'm able to read the news, check email, and watch videos without having to worry about the battery draining or keeping it constantly charged.\n\nI haven't seen a Kindle Fire HDX in person, but I think the two are very comparable. I decided to go with the Nexus 7 because I prefer a vanilla version of Android over the Fire OS."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "What happened, did I just die and go to heaven?\n\nThis thing so far exceeds the minimal requirements for 5 stars  its imperfections are slight and more than compensated for (based on 2 days of use).\n\nIts quad-core, surround sound, super thinness, and Retina display alone give it a 5 star.\n\nThere should be as much buzz for this as for the iPad mini, since the two are equivalent in important ways, with the Nexus 7 actually being better in other ways, including its rubberized back.  When I first laid eyes on it I knew I would have it.\n\nSETTING UP\nMinutes out of the box (4 minutes), not only were all the apps on my other android device automatically copied over, but the painstakingly designed custom eq settings from the PowerAMP app also.  It was a freak out moment.  I didn't have to create a gmail account, it was ALREADY THERE!  with the cool new interface.  Because its a google device, it just magically retrieved all this from the cloud.  It even upgraded to version 4.4 (Kit-Kat), all practically as I was still unboxing it, so freak out.\n\nSCREEN SIZE  at 7 inches, big enough to provide a big screen experience while still being small enough to hold in one hand, this may represent the elusive sweet spot for screen size where portable multimedia is the priority.  I also have a Samsung Galaxy player 5 inch, which Ive had for over a year with great satisfaction for multimedia and reading the news, and which I will continue to use, and which might even be better first thing in the morning before I put my contacts in and I hold the player only inches from my eyes, where a smaller screen would have an obvious advantage, or also for when Im just playing tunes.  I may actually prefer the UI (user interface) of the Samsung but then again Im so accustomed to it.  Bear in mind I didn't get the Nexus 7 to replace my Galaxy player 5, which in its own way also represents a sweet spot for me in terms of size and usability.\n\nThe Nexus 7, because of its bigger screen, allows for greater use of widgets than on smaller screens like my Galaxy 5-inch.  Im just beginning to appreciate that widgets allow for more immediate control of the device, or to display streaming information  that is actually a bigger step forward than I had anticipated when considering my new Nexus 7.  With smaller screen sizes you cant fully exploit the world of widgets!\n\nTHINNESS  8.65 mm.  If it was just 1mm thinner it would run the risk of flexing or snapping in two so it would be silly to wait for something thinner.  Even most thin cell phones in use today are at least 2-3 mm thicker.  So if thin is your thing you may as well hoot and holler right now.\n\nIMAGE QUALITY  323 ppi, compared to 326 on the iPads Retina display of the iPhone and iPad Touch.  So text and images are, suffice to say, beautiful.  The slightly larger iPad mini and even bigger iPads actually have less ppi than this (less resolution).  With my contact lenses on and the screen about 12 or so inches from my eyes I cant see individual pixels even with reading glasses  which is the general assumption of Retina display, even though without my contacts and the screen only a few inches from my eyes I can discern individual pixels if I stare at it, but lets not belabor the issue.  The images of this, the Nexus 7 2013 edition, are RAZOR SHARP and YOU WILL LIKE IT!\n\nIncidentally, I have the screen brightness at about 10% and that provides great contrast in subdued lighting indoors (while maximizing battery life).  Even outside in sunlight, 100% brightness seems more than enough for a bright, sharp image.\n\nSOUND  At a certain threshold of sound quality, the spirit is moved, and these speakers are at that threshold.  As with Retina display for the eyes, so it is with Fraunhofer surround sound for the ears.  Youll be holding this in one hand while you dance around, as I was while streaming music from the cloud.  You do not need to plug into an auxiliary speaker.  There are speakers at both the top and bottom of the device, providing surprisingly good fidelity and surround sound (as might be expected from  the inventors of MP3 technology itself).  It practically qualifies as room filling.  Satisfying for both music and talk.  The speakers face the back, and might be better than some of the cheaper plug-in speakers.  I haven't decided if the sound is better facing front or backward.  It also has Bluetooth.  Its so great when these devices have speakers, even better when they're as good as this.\n\nNO SD CARD SLOT\nBut the built-in 32 GB (actually less) more than compensates for this, and it can be plugged into some external hard drives (or thumb drives) full of movies or other files with a $3 OTG cable.  The Nexus 7 is designed to exploit wireless, streaming technologies, not serve as a repository for a movie library.  Much multimedia content is streamed and never stored on the device.  For music, the incapability to expand this is unlikely to be a problem because its too big to be used as a primary MP3 player.\n\nPLUSSES\n Its rubberized back (actually a hard, black plastic), which makes it easier to hold, and also warmer to the touch.  This alone may be worth half a star.  Ive actually dropped my other tablet, the 5-inch Player, a few times over the last year, fortunately always on carpet.\n 5 MP back camera and a 1.2 MP for the front.  Theres no flash but the usual assortment of controls.  Cameras on tablets are a gimmick and purely for random fun moments.  I would never use a 7-inch tablet to take pictures.\n It has other things like NFC and with an adapter can be plugged into your TV with a HDMI cable, theres just so much potential.  There are other cool features too numerous to mention.\n Some of the 3rd party cases carry on the spirit of thinness, and double as an easel  I will probably invest in one of these.\n It has that slippery glass that the fingers like to slide around on, and easier to wipe clean than regular glass or plastic.\n\nCONS\nSlight negatives I have already suggested or implied do not really compromise its stellar rating.  In this case, personal electronics have matured to the point where it is no longer necessary to offer the usual criticisms, so everybody high five."}

My reviews are typically more detailed, but I want to keep this to the point...\n\nI am an Android and an IOS user - I don't really have an OS bias. The screen on the 7 is what really sold it - nice color range, very bright, text is beautiful and sharp. I am reading much smaller fonts than I typically use. It is also light, thin and fast. The camera is fair, though an led lamp would be nice, maybe placed on the front for video calls in dim light. My iPhone has a wonderful camera, so this is not a biggie. Speakers are small, so not very loud, but they sound very good for their size - placement was thoughtful - good separation.\n\nSetup was a breeze. I provided my Google account information, and all my previous app purchases and settings from my original Motorola Xoom tablet were automatically installed - that's it... done!\n\nCons [you were looking for the cons, weren't you?]:\n\n-Screen is \"touchy\" (pun intended) - sometimes a touch doesn't register - not a huge concern for me;\n\n-WiFi cut-out regularly, when watching streaming video - it seems, however, that the 4.4.2 update MAY HAVE CORRECTED this as I haven't experienced it since updating last night - too soon to be sure;\n[Updated 12/14/2013: After a few days of the 4.4.2 update, the wifi has only cut out one time - with several uses. It seems that the update has mostly fixed the problem.]\n\n-Battery life had not been what I expected, even with minimal power settings, and using airplane mode when not online. I suspect that I have better battery life with the 4.4.2 update - again, too soon to be sure;\n[Updated 12/14/2013: I have noticed increased life in the battery, but I also made some changes to my \"notifications\" and set other power options to minimal. I put the Power widget on my home screen, to make turning wifi on and off simpler, too. If you go to \"Settings>Apps\" and turn off notifications on your gmail, facebook, and other apps, you can manually refresh when you check these applications, but they don't check for updates on their own - this seems to save quite a bit of power throughout the day.]\n\n-Amazon Instant Video is NOT supported here! Come On, Amazon! Give a guy a break!\n\nOther notes:\n\nI purchased one of those slim covers, similar to the origami style that the iPad was famous for. [MoKo Google New Nexus 7 FHD 2nd Gen Case - Ultra Slim Lightweight Smart-shell Stand Case for Google Nexus 2 7.0 Inch 2013 Generation Android 4.3 Tablet] Nice case - Inexpensive, lightweight, and attractive. The folding cover is touchy when used as a stand, but it keeps a slim profile while protecting the tablet [I know... It fell onto the tile floor last night!].\n\nThe iPad Mini Retina is a beaut! I simply cannot justify spending $500 for the 32GB version when this Nexus is available at less than half the price. If price (and availability) weren't a factor, I'd have bought the iPad Mini Retina, but price is a factor, and the Nexus 7 is, without a doubt, the best bang for the buck on the market today.\n\nI hope to update this post when I have more experience with the 4.4.2 update, but I wanted to get my 2-cents in. Thanks again for playing. Let the flames begin!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "Touch-pad input on this tablet never worked exactly right. It is a subtle problem which took a long time for me to characterize. I finally found mention of the app \"YAMTT\" in the blogs, downloaded it, and used it to test the tablet. After swiping around for a while in the lower left corner of the tablet, the line being drawn will change from blue to red, indicating that the tablet has decided it is a 2nd rather than the 1st finger being dragged. There is no 1st finger, and the red 2nd finger is the ONLY input being registered. Unfortunately if you are trying to swype or gesture type, the app won't register the \"2nd finger\" as a valid input. So I basically cannot swype-type on this device. It makes it virtually useless, and horribly, terribly, frustrating. It was not obvious what was going on, because it would just interrupt the gesture line and pop a couple of short estimates of words similar to the longer word I was trying to gesture type.\n\nI wasn't entirely sure that this was a failure until I located a friend with a similar Nexus 7, and tried them side-by-side. The bad news is it took a few more than 30 days for me to become fully convinced that this was a faulty device, and now I find that Amazon won't allow me to return it.\n\nAfter checking in more detail, I find that it is well-known in the Nexus 7 blogs that an entire batch of the touch-input screen devices were faulty, and, in some cases, vendors sold them anyway. This is FRAUD, pure and simple.\n\nI purchased this devices from Amazon proper, not one of the 3rd parties. I cannot believe that Amazon would besmirch their reputation and long-term sales by sticking their customers with a few faulty devices which were known to be failures by the manufacturer. But I cannot find a way to contact a real person at Amazon anymore. Their \"online return system\" simply cycles me through increasingly larger loops which end up saying the device cannot be returned. EVEN ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT AMAZON END IN THIS ON-LINE NIGHTMARE LOOP. I am an early Amazon customer, have always had good experiences with Amazon until now, and am flabbergasted. I cannot believe that Amazon would involve itself in fraud, but how can I believe otherwise if they refuse and actively prevent me from contacting them about this issue? PLEASE, AMAZON, WAKE UP!!!"}

It's fast like everyone says, with front and rear cameras, and battery life also lasts surprisingly long ~9 hours. Why am I giving it 2 stars then?! Well, the manufacturing process stinks! If you carefully look at your front camera, I bet it's not even centered. I got four Nexus 7 from W-mart and 3 of them had dead pixels; the fourth unit had a big dust particle between the front camera and the glass so I didn't even bother testing it for dead pixels. I immediately got a refund. 4 out of 4 bad Nexus 7 can't be a coincidence. I advice anyone who purchases this Nexus 7 2nd gen to download \"dead pixel test\" from the PlayStore and check.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "After a long period of reviewing this tablet, and having owned a defective model from 2012, seeing all the very poor reviews and having experienced many negative things that I won't mention here about Google customer service, I decided not to gamble with this device. Yet something about the tech guys on YouTube changed my mind, their insistence that despite the poor quality of some of the devices, it is truly a winner. I tried to get a deal on Amazon but they didn't have any when I looked so I purchased from a competitor, which quite frankly was a frightening experience simply because I don't use any other online shopping and I have always had a great experience with Amazon. The other store was far slower than Amazon but still got it to my door. It truly felt like gambling when I unboxed it and booted it up, will I win or lose?  So far a win... big win!  I own the ipad mini, iPod touch 5th Gen, and several other top end models, I really like this tablet, yes it has some of the little niggling quirks of the Android os but is as fast and fluid as my iPad and iPod,.... In it's Android sort of way,  meaning some apps still make it hicough, or crash but not as many as before.  I honestly think that this device feels better than my mini, and the screen is truly, truly, truly masterful! The device looks like a dark chocolate bar with a screen, beautiful! Just don't try to eat it. I have found that it is a very special little tablet and can highly recommend it, but like a lot of electronics these days, they are not all created equal  so buy from a reputable company and be willing to ship it back or better yet buy this one from a  brick and mortar, so you can exchange it for a good one,.. If you get a good one you will really like it!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "****12/12/13 update:  I took my first cross country trip with my Nexus 7.  This is the first time I have EVER traveled without my laptop but I wanted to see if I could get by since it is so much easier and lighter to travel with a 7\" tablet than a 14\" laptop.  I have to admit that I really enjoyed the trip.  It is a 6 hour flight from NYC to LA so I downloaded 4 movies (2 from Google Play and 2 that I already had).  I was able to watch 2 movies and play a few games that I have on my Nexus 7 and still had over 50% battery left.  With the exception of not being able to play my favorite Facebook game due to the lack of Flash I did not miss my laptop at all.  I had ZERO problems connecting and staying connected to the hotel wi-fi.  I have not tried to use the GPS function yet since I use my Samasung Galaxy SIII for navigation but I am going to try since I have read some reviews that say the Nexus 7 has trouble keeping locked on to satellites.\nAlso tonight when I got back home my Nexus updated to 4.4.2.  I have to admit that one of my favorite things about having a Nexus device is always having the most up to date rom without having to root the device.\nI do follow this review and will be more than happy to respond to any questions you may have about the Nexus 7 (2013)\n\nI have had the tablet for about 2 weeks now and so far it has lived up to my expectations.  I did not buy it from Amazon but let me share how I got a great deal on it.  During Black Friday week Walmart was offering the 2013 FHD model in 32gb for 229.  Staples has a price match guarantee and was also offering a $50 off any tablet $149.99 and above.  So I got the price match to Walmarts price and used the $50 off coupon for a total of 179.99 for the 32GB 2013 model.\n\nUnpacking;  After taking the Nexus 7 out of the box, turning it on and adding my account I was immediately met with an update is available.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that my Nexus was updated to 4.4 KitKat.  It's nice to buy a product directly supported by Google and not having to wait for another company to add their overlays before pushing the upgrades.\n\nDesign:  It's thin, it's comfortable, it's light, and there's a perfect amount of bezel around the display. Furthermore, the combination of tough scratch-resistant glass and soft-touch plastic makes the Nexus 7 physically feel really nice when you're holding it, but equally tough: there's no flex in the build at all.  One feature I really liked was the notification light below the display, glowing whenever you receive an email or Facebook message.  Other than the logo you can find a 5-megapixel camera in the top corner surrounded by a large glass lens, as well as dual rear-facing speakers, which really enhances the sound quality while watching videos. Not enough devices of this size feature left and right speakers, and it's great to see Asus managing to squeeze this feature into the budget.\n\nDisplay:  Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of the Nexus 7 is the display, which seems to defy the price tag associated with the device. It sports a 1920 x 1200, IPS LCD panel with a density of 323 ppi.  The high resolution and high pixel density of the Nexus 7's panel makes video watching and web browsing that much more enjoyable and text looks extremely sharp without any visible jagged edges. It's also nice to have a 7-inch tablet that can display 1080p movies at native resolution so you'll be getting the full clarity of Blu-ray playback without downscaling.  Vibrant images look amazing on the display, and not far off what one would consider a `true to life' image.  Contrast is very good, and white levels appear perfect with no color tinting to speak of.  The display produces a decent amount of light, which helps significantly when you're trying to use the Nexus 7 outdoors or in a bright environment. It's actually very easy to read text on this tablet in all conditions. Auto-brightness also works well, adapting quickly to light changes.\n\nSoftware:  The Nexus 7 runs pure Android 4.4 'KitKat' without any device-specific customizations which, as I stated above, means you will receive new software updates as soon as they are available.\n\nPerformance:  The nexus 7 features a quad-core processor clocked at 1.5 GHz, alongside an Adreno 320 GPU clocked at 400 MHz, an LPDDR3 memory controller, a Hexagon digital signal processor, and radios for Bluetooth 4.0 and dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n.  The tablet also has 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage. Unfortunately there's no microSD card slot to expand the storage, though I still found it to be plenty of space.  The Nexus 7 is a smooth and capable performer. Android feels well optimized for the device, so you're always getting the interface rendered at 60 frames per second with no lag to speak of. App switching is fast, and 2 GB of RAM allows a lot of applications to be stored for quick access.  Improvements to both Android and Chrome, especially in recent months, have made Chrome much nicer to use. It can be a little slow when zooming in or switching tabs while you wait for the webpage to re-render, but overall I was happy with the browsing capabilities.\n\nBattery:  I found battery life to be very good thanks to software optimizations and a more power-efficient CPU. Whether you're browsing the web on Wi-Fi or watching a video, generally the tablet lasts at least nine hours, if not more if you use a low brightness setting.\n\nCamera:  The included 5-megapixel camera isn't the most amazing I've seen, images can appear a little grainy in dark conditions.\nIn near-perfect conditions, the Nexus 7 is a very capable camera. There isn't a huge range of shooting modes or settings to control image quality, but I found automatic white balance to function accurately most of the time, and photos were rarely overexposed.  It does not have a flash, so it's no surprise that the Nexus 7 is unsuitable for photography in low-light conditions.\n\nSummary:  From the moment I powered on the new Nexus 7, I knew it would easily be the best 7-inch Android tablet. With a fantastic 1080p display that's ideal for gaming, reading and video watching, plus a slim and light design it's clear that Asus knows how to produce a solid tablet.  It's very speedy and despite it's small battery the Nexus 7 gives decent battery life, thanks to clever software and firmware optimizations.\n\nI am so far very happy with my purchase."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I bought a Nexus 7 32gb tablet after doing about 4 hours of research and following the reviews on Amazon and other sites, but I sent it back and bought a Nook HD 7 16Gb tablet instead.  Let me explain why.\n\nWithout a doubt, the Nexus 7 is the fastest, sleakest, most useful tablet on the market.  But.....but.....but, I believe ASUS has some serious quality control issues.  In my case I played around with it for about 6 hours, installing all sorts of applications without issue, then the reboots started happening. I got about 4 of them in 1 hour.  So I applied the OS update like many other reviewers recommended.  After the update I used it for another 2 hours and then I got a total lockup, and this happened twice in about 15 minutes, so that was it for me.\n\nFortunately I bought it at Walmart.com because it was cheaper at $229 and because it's no hassle to return it to the store, which is what I did.  I should also mention that the other reason I took it back was because I believe the device just doesn't have the durability it needs for a mobile device.  I was planning on getting a case for it, but nonetheless, it's very thin and there's no margin for error between the edge of the glass screen and the edge of the device.  And I read quite a few reviews where people said they cracked the screen without doing anything rough with it, so that also factored into my decision to return it.\n\nOverall if ASUS can fix their quality control problems and do something about the durability of the device, then this tablet will stay on top as the premier device for people that want a high-performing Android at a reasonable price (when compared to the iPad).\n\nI mentioned that I bought a Nook HD 7 16gb from Barnes & Noble after returning the Nexus, and I couldn't be more pleased.  I got it for a great price of $99 for black Friday weekend, and I love it.  It's completely compatible with the google play store now, minus a handful of incompatible apps, and you can even install some apps to make it look more like an Android and less like a Nook.  I've been using it for about a week now and have had zero issues.  It's a great device with an awesome display, performs very well, and looks and feels very durable."}

No good version of the Arduino Sketch IDE has been ported, though.\n\nI'm using a bluetooth mouse with it in order to use a CAD program. A bit different than working on a 19 inch LCD, but I can carry the Nexus with me anywhere. I bought a case and screen protector for it, and carry it with me in a pocket of my cargo pants and the mouse in my other cargo pocket. Yes, I'm a nerd.\n\nThe camera seems able to focus closer than the camera in my Samsung phone, something that has come in handy.\n\nI have read that there have been problems using bluetooth keyboards with the Nexus 2013, although an update to Android 4.4 just installed so that may not be an issue any more.\n\nUpdate: After using this for several years, I'm downgrading my 5 star to a 2 star review.\n\nThe autorotation randomly stops working. I've installed an app to check the sensor, the sensor works fine. Yet it often gets \"stuck\" in portrait or landscape, and it doesn't seem to matter which app it is running.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I've had the Nexus 7 for about 3 weeks and have yet to explore a tenth of what it can do. So far I haven't hit any unworkable glitches at all except in various apps, such as the Kindle app, where enlargement of illustrations has been a pain (but I think that's Kindle's fault).\n\nThe tablet has great screen resolution. Great size--fits in a deep jacket pockets, even with a case.\n\nOne thing I especially like is that with the USB connection you can drag and drop files between the Nexus and your regular computer--if you can find them.  The AntTek Explorer Ap is helping with that.  Sometimes the Google Apps gobble everything up and you don't know where things are.\n\nI do have one other complaint and that is the documentation, which is practically non-existent.  In the box you get zero. You have to go online for the booklet, and that is minimal. For anything else you have to consult the user forums. If I had ONLY the tablet, that would be tough.  Several times I've had to sit at my regular computer and look at forums while I have my tablet in hand. Much of what I've figured out has been by stumbling around.  I suppose that is now the way of things, but I'm one who has always actually consulted the direction booklets.\n\nIt would be nice to know, for instance, how thoroughly one should turn the tablet off and when. You can put it to sleep with a button tap or letting it go off, or you can shut it down by holding the button in for several seconds and then choosing your shut-down mode.  I could probably find this out from the forums, but, gee, wouldn't it be elementary to TELL us this?\n\nOr take the built-in clock.  I can't tell you how frustrating it was to try to turn off the alarm clock without waking everyone else in the house. I even consulted the forums.  Finally I stumbled onto what I suppose the makers thought was obvious-a sideways swipe of a finger.\n\nAll in all, though, this tablet is a wonderful value. For me it came down to a choice between the Nexus 7 and the new IPad mini 2. The file transfer and size proportions tipped the balance for me, and the price confirmed my choice."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I picked this Nexus 7 model up a few months ago at a Best Buy store. I really have enjoyed it in the past several months I've been using it, and I wanted to discuss some of my experiences with it.\n\nFirst of all, tablet Android has really come a long way. I remembered having another Android tablet back in 2011, and I ended up selling it because the app selection really wasn't there yet. But it seems like since the release of last year's Nexus 7 that tablet development has really started to pick up. Add in the fact that it's also a stock Android device, and you can see why people want to buy it instead of settling with skinned or modified versions of Android. The Nexus 7 has pure, vanilla Android on it. At the time I write this, the latest version of Android, Kit Kat, has already been released on it.\n\nThe app ecosystem dramatically improved. I use a lot of nice apps that work on tablet and phone, and there are a few that just work better on the tablet alone, like any comic or ebook readers. If you're somebody who loves to play games, you'll probably love the Nexus 7 even more than a phone. It always seems to me that game developers love tablets. There's so many games to choose from it makes your head spin.\n\nI never used last year's Nexus 7, but I do know of the improvements in this new one compared to that model. For one, the new Nexus 7 has a screen capable of 1080p resolution. It's also got this matte black finish on the back, where it says \"NEXUS\" on it. If you hold the tablet the default, portrait style, then you'll find the volume buttons and power button to your right side towards the top. On the back side to the left is the camera. The camera quality isn't anything to write home about, but it doesn't matter much to me, as I rarely ever bother using it. But considering it's even an option now (last year's Nexus had no camera), I guess you can say having the option is better than not having it.\n\nAt the bottom of the tablet is the USB port, where you can plug in any standard micro USB to charge it or connect it to your PC. Then just behind that on the back are the speaker grills. They're not remarkably strong, but they work. Plus, I have a wireless bluetooth speaker if I ever want to listen to audio on it at a higher quality.\n\nSo it's got a lot of improvements because tablet Android has had more time to mature, and the Nexus 7's hardware has been improved compared to last year's. I never used last year's tablet, but this one has excellent battery life as well. It can go over 2 days on a full charge for me. I don't really pay too much attention to specs on these tablets. So long as they're not very low-end like pre-paid Android phones, then I can see myself buying it.\n\nI really do like my Nexus 7, but I had to deduct a star because the build quality isn't as great as I was hoping. I'm quite careful with my devices, and I treated my Nexus 7 no differently. However, one day I took it out of my messenger bag and found the corner was damaged. The screen wasn't affected, but it looked like something hit the bottom right corner of the tablet hard enough to break off some of the plastic. It's kind of a chip. It really annoyed me to see it, so I eventually ordered a case that would cover it up.\n\nThat's not too bad, since the case covers up that damage and also prevents more. The case I ordered is one of those CruzerLite silicone/plastic sleeves with the Android robot on it. It adds a bit of style to my Nexus 7's plain look. I was satisfied, until one day I tried wiping the screen's smudges off. Then I realized that there was a scratch on the screen that would not go away no matter how hard I tried to get rid of it. I had to order a screen protector that claims to cover and fill scratches on screens, and I suppose that it's working because I can't see it anymore.\n\nI am a bit disappointed in how easily the Nexus 7 took this mysterious damage because I am always careful with my devices. The build quality isn't as sturdy as you would believe, as I've seen from the damage it's taken. I'm very disappointed that the screen even took a scratch, considering that you can buy a phone like the HTC One with its nigh unscratchable screen (there's a YouTube video of somebody trying to use a screwdriver to scratch the HTC One's bare screen and failing to leave any damage) and sturdy aluminum unibody, yet you can't buy a flagship tablet that has the same build quality. I know the price is quite good, but I actually wouldn't mind paying a bit more for a stronger, better-built, flagship tablet.\n\nHowever, it's still 4 stars because it's still a very usable tablet, even with the minor damage mine has. It still responds and works as it should. I would recommend it only if you buy it with a protective case (a case that actually protects or covers it, not a folio case) and a good screen protector. It's not as sturdy as you'd think, so be prepared to take very good care of it. The improved app ecosystem makes it all worth it."}

The battery life, the screen resolution are two.\n\nHowever, the issues that renders productivity null gives this tablet a 'no buy' recommendation. You have no doubt heard of the buggy keyboard that randomly switches from alpha to numeric to symbols? Well the problem still exist. Browsing the internet, the connection is snappy. However, the screens occasionally zooms and locks - forcing you to continually hit your screen hoping for it to zoom out or you have to refresh the screen. One or twice is an annoyance. Three or more is an issue.\n\nThe other issues are the native email apps. These are truly the worst available email apps. My Samsung and iPhone email apps do a better job by far. Basic features such as sort is missing. This cuts down on productivity if you receive more than one email per day or have more than one email address. Note that the delete function does not work when using the search function. What happens is the emails appears to delete with a system note, but when you exit search the emails are still there. These are some of the few annoying issues that plague this tablet. I can attest that my wife does not experience any of these issues with her apple tablet."}

So much that I wanted to use it for was already installed.  If you are a heavy user of Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, etc., then this is the tablet you want.  The screen is a tactile and visual pleasure.  (Not a scratch after weeks of carrying it in my purse without a case too.)  It upgraded painlessly and effortlessly to Android Kit Kat as soon as it was available.  One of the best features is that it doesn't have all the junk software added on top of the operating system that other tablets have.  It functions at decent speeds even with a weak WiFi signal.  I've dropped it once on concrete flooring (in a case) and it suffered no damage.  At first I thought the camera wasn't so great, then I figured out how to adjust for the lighting (incandescent/fluorescent/daylight) and now I'm taking amazing pictures.  Uploading them to Facebook or Google Drive is a piece of cake.  I'm old, so operating a tablet wasn't intuitive for me, but after a month I had the hang of it and I absolutely love my Nexus 7."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "This tablet is a massive improvement over last year's model. I bought last year's model and was HIGHLY disappointed with the lag I was getting after several months of usage. I knew the bottleneck was the 1gb ram and they were using a processor from 2011 in a 2012 tablet.\n\nThat problem has been fixed in this one. With 2gb of ram and a snapdragon s4 pro processor, this tablet flies. There is no noticeable slowdown. They have added a camera but its not all that great. The speakers have been updated, and although i wouldn't say the sound is \"surrounding\" me, it is much louder from last years model. Also, the screen was a major reason i upgraded and is definetly worth it for this steal of a price. Last year's model was a little washed out but the 2013 model is extremely bright and colors are accurate. Pixels can no longer be differentiated in this tablet and is a joy to read books and magazines on.\n\nI am not going to compare this with the Ipad mini Retina hardware wise. Both tablets have great displays and the average consumer won't notice much difference. However, in terms of usability, the android TABLET app ecosystem has some ways to go. The Ipad has WAYYY more apps than what is currently available on android. However, if all you need is something to check email on, play a few games, watch hulu/netflix, read news..... most of the heavy big hitter apps are available. There is no need to plunk down 500 dollars for an ipad.\n\nA few cons: The power buttons and the volume rocker are on the same side and a little flush. Sometimes I hit the power button when i just want to turn the volume up. Battery life is great but definitely not top notch. I get around 5 hours of \"screen on\" time."}

I use it all the time and I am now thinking of getting rid of my laptop and getting a desktop (since the laptop now seems so bulky).\n\nThe Kindle and Overdrive apps plus the AWESOME Seattle Public Library digital collection have actually encouraged me to read more books.  The only thing that has made me sad is that the charger port is loose and the micro USB cord falls out easily and the screen and back cover has come loose in one corner, which I found out by trying to pull my tablet out of it's cover. It has not affected my usage or performance of the tablet at all."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "This is the best tablet I've tried among many that claim to be better. Materials are sturdy and well made, it feels resistant but super lightweight and holding it as it is (without any cover) feels really natural, although the screen is really large and the sides to hold it are small, you don't feel tired to hold it so fast mainly because of the lightweight... the sound quality is really good but perhaps it is not that powerful so I would recommend buying some bluetooth external speakers to raise volume higher, nevertheless if you use built-in speakers to watch youtube videos and so forth it'll be good and also they put a really clear sound...\n\nConcerning the software and OS experience I really feel this is the best you can get if you like android systems, this would be without exaggerating the best tablet to run android in the market, the whole experience is frustration free and so easy that you don't even notice it... so, if there were any product out there that can compete with the new apple ipads it is definitively the google nexus tablet, specs are really great and the quality of the whole product is outstanding.\n\nI would totally recommend this tablet to any user who needs a tablet to browse the internet, check mail, watch videos (except flash videos), listen to music and play games to buy with confident the google nexus tablets, they're so great!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "Have had this for two months and I LOVE it. Now that airlines allow you to use tablets the entire time you are in the cabin I wanted to get away from paper books and mags. I have a large screen on my laptop and a tiny screen on my phone so I opted for the 7 inch tablet that is in between the two. For most things this was the perfect decision. The only issue is when I am sitting in an airplane seat and I prop the nexus on the tray table it is too small for me to really see recorded TV shows. This is only time I would have preferred the 10 inch screen tablets. In all other situations the small size is better. To fix the problem of TV shows, just buy the MoKo 2nd gen slim fit case. It allows you to attach the N7 to your hand without having to grasp it. Makes two hours of TV watching comfortable. The size allows this to fit into my front pants pocket (with some sticking out but securely in my pocket).\n\nI have TiVo DVRs so I got the TiVo Desktop Plus software. It transfers shows to my laptop and then auto converts them for my tablet. If you use this select (Convert for Apple Ipad which is MP4 format). I connect my N7 to my laptop in MTP mode and use Windows explorer to transfer the TV shows to my N7. I now have HD TiVo recordings that I can watch on the airplane.\n\nLast night my N7 said it was ready to update to Android 4.4 (KitKat). I said OK and it rebooted right away with the new OS (It must have downloaded in the background ahead of time). This is why I wanted the Nexus product. I will always get the new Android OS without any of the phone manufacturer BS.\n\nPros:\n-Light weight\n-Brilliant beautiful, clear HD screen with vibrant colors. Watching HD video is FANTASTIC. Much better than my laptop.\n-Fast processor. Turn it completely around and screen will orient instantly in all four directions. Much faster than my Galaxy S3 phone or my win7 laptop\n-Excellent battery life. I normally charge nightly but a couple of times when I didn't I still stayed abouve 50% battery with moderate to heavy use.\n-WiFi only is not a problem. If free wifi is not available I turn on my phones hotspot. If I had gotten a tablet with 4G-LTE I would pay an extra $10 a month and the exact same data usage costs. Not worth it.\n-I don't use the camera but I tested it and it took a good image\n-Ideal device for consuming written and video content\n-separate pull down control panel on right and notification screen on left. This is much better than my phone which combines these\n-Durable and well made\n\nCons:\n-Sound volume is TOO low. I think KitKat may have improved this slightly but this is my one big complaint. If I only use earbuds and the surroundings are very noisy it is a little hard to hear my TV shows.\n-Screen is perfect size EXCEPT for watching TV on a plane with the device on the TV tray. The MoKo case solves this\n\nIf you are not sure which tablet to buy . . . then this is the one. Perfect in almost every way."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I bought a nexus 7 in late August to take on a trip to Spain, replacing my 10 inch Lenovo K1, which was orphaned within 6 months of my purchasing it. One of my main requirements was that its GPS work, and work well, since I planned to use it to navigate the El Camino using citymaps2go and the free OSMAND.org map app, both of which worked off-line (unlike Google maps.)\n\nI could never get the GPS to work reliably, and after going online found hundreds of posts relating to just this problem. WIthin 2 days I returned the tablet, having been unsuccessful in downloading an update that fixed the problem. It appeared no other user had done so either.\n\nInstead, on a suggestion from a user who was in the GPS discussion, I bought a WalMart Hisense Sero 7 pro. It was $100 less expensive, and the GPS worked perfectly out of the box. It is slightly heavier and thicker, but has plenty of battery life, cameras, good screen, and can be broken or lost without breaking the bank. After the trip, during which it worked perfectly, I noticed one slight problem with one horizontal display line failing right where the bottom menu starts, but it was unnoticeable in most circumstances. I sent it back for repair and will report back when and if it gets returned.\n\nUpdate: the unit was returned working perfectly within 1-2 weeks, and they had made sure to return the microSD card I had inadvertently left in. I'm very satisfied with the service!"}

I have a recently purchased my first Samsung smart phone which I rarely use, but I do spend about 20 hrs a week on the home computer.\n\nAfter a week, I am very impressed with the Nexus 7. I was more than concerned about technical issues with the tablet after reading reviews, enough so that I decided not to buy a pre-owned tablet, no matter how good a price it may have seemed. Amazon had a great price on this with the 2 yr warranty (double what Radio Shack offered). I couldn't be more pleased!\n\nThe main reason I bought this was for the exceptional HD screen clarity, which this does not disappoint. Compared to a few other tablets I have listened to, the sound is fantastic.\n\nI also bought the Omoton case (B00E6NKBXI), amFilm screen saver (B00FRIJPCY) which is considerably smudged after just a few hours of use, a Keyboard stand/case (B00EDTTIXE) which has not yet arrived, and the \"Google Nexus 7 Tablet: Visual QuickStart Guide\", which I very highly recommend.\n\nEven having watched 10 yrs of You Tube instructions on the tablet, the book was mandatory for me. I have learned a great deal in just a few days. Next to the tablet purchase, the book was probably the most important accessory I could have purchased.\n\nUpdate: Nov 27th, 2013. 1 week later, the backlight had been flickering just barely noticeably for a couple of days, something I thought might have been part of the notifications process and loading many apps. On day six, it started blanking out while in use, picking it up or going back to a locked screen after just minutes of use.\n\nI checked the symptoms on You Tube. Sure enough it was a loose battery connector. I called Google and was told to return the unit. The price had gone up $44 since I bought it a week prior. Amazon was excellent and offered to refund the difference after I bought another Nexus at full price. Still waiting for that to arrive.\n\nBeware of the problems and price fluctuations."}

The battery life leaves a little to be desired especially in standby mode but I found that Google Play Services is eating up battery for unknown reasons (just uncovered a few days ago), so hopefully a fix is coming for that shortly.\n\nOtherwise, overall this has been my absolute favorite tablet experience. I did like the iPad Mini but it felt restrictive for the price, and the Android-based Nexus 7 seems to allow me to do more.

I have been impressed with Google as of late and their product offering. I am slowly losing my taste for apple and since I have been using an Android phone since January, I decide to upgrade from an iPad 2 to the new Nexus 7. I log onto Amazon and place my order for a 2013 32GB Nexus 7... overnight shipping of course (I MUST have the tablet in hand tomorrow!).\n\nFast forward 24 hours and I open the Amazon box to see the Google Nexus box inside. I open the Nexus box and notice that the Nexus 7 is encased in plastic wrapping but there is dust and small particles all over the plastic. This was the very first thing that irked me. I unwrap the Nexus and immediately get excited by its form, weight and overall simple beauty. I charge the device fully and go to power it on. I am presented with the Welcome screen and then the \"Select Wifi Connection\" screen... but the device will not connect to my wifi. The one or two times it saves the connection, it immediately says the connection is not available. It simply will not progress further into the setup process. After an hour of rebooting my router, checking my admin settings and reading articles online, I decide to do a factory reset of the device. Yes, a factory reset on a device that is fresh out of the packaging and never set up.\n\nI go through the process of restoring the Nexus to its factory settings and it worked! I was able to set up the Nexus and I am in heaven... or so I thought. Over the course of playing with the new device and in the matter of a couple of hours, I notice that the headphone jack does not work. No sound through the headphones... period. In fact, I could hear the stereo sound pouring out of the Nexus speakers while my headphones were plugged in. I'm not happy. It was all downhill from there. The device started rebooting all by itself. Each time I wonder if the OTA Kit Kat update had been installed and it rebooted because of an update. Nope.\n\nWell to make a long story short, the Nexus rebooted 2-3 times on its own and then got stuck in an infinite loop of the Google screen flashing on and off. I attempted to restore the device to factory settings once more. It didn't work. It wouldn't move past the Google screen. It was charged. It was connected. It was put through several hard reboots. Finally, I get the Welcome screen again. I click the giant arrow and move to the Wifi Connection screen. Then the touch screen fails. No touch is registered on the screen period. After 2-3 seconds of tapping on the screen, the Nexus reboots by itself. It immediately goes to the Google screen and is stuck on the infinite loop of the Google logo flashing on and then off.\n\nI log onto to Amazon, print off my return authorization and shipping label and now its in the hands of UPS. Now I sit here waiting for a refund without a tablet. I sold my iPad 2 in order to buy this Nexus 7. I'm so disappointed. I can't begin to tell you just how much."}

Essential apps: HuluPlus, Plex, Marvel Unlimited, Amazon Kindle, Cool Reader, Comic Book Rack, Super GNES, TTorrent, Dolphin Web Browser  (can run Flash with the Legacy Flash App installed), Netflix, Crackle, FPse (playstation roms), PINBALL ARCADE (so this). I also recommend Max Payne and the Room for games. Go ahead and pay the extra for the 32 gig version, it's worth it. The screen is fantastic, with brightness levels that are at times absurd. Haven't really used the camera much except to test skype, and it's good. Also has built in simulated surround support for apps that support it, like netflix. I got mine used and it was in perfect condition, if you're looking to shave a few dollars off of the price, getting a used one is not a bad idea. Anyways, very impressed and satisfied with my purpose. I use it to update my blog and do all sorts of other things. Only complaint is with Android, it's still an operating system that is hindered by device fragmentation. With out the ability to optimize for devices all Android apps have silly bugs and can be sluggish at times, with occasional freezes. It's not a deal breaker but it makes what is an overpowered device sometimes seem like an underpowered one, but this is a problem with all Android devices and would be considerably worse in a lesser powered device."}

Google has come a long way in what they offer and the hardware they produce. With the price and how fast everything is, I have jumped ship from Apple and am now totally Google.

I noticed a lot of one star reviews that had phrases like \"users report the GPS doesn't work.\" First of all, if you're writing a review, you should try the product for yourself and not rely on word of mouth. That being said, I have had no problems with my GPS. The screen display is amazing... Clear and crisp picture. I have had it in a case and dropped it multiple times without any cracks or malfunctions, but I can't give an accurate review as to the durability without a case. I also own an iPad which I paid twice as much for, and I like the nexus much better. Operating android allows me to download emulators and other such apps without having to jailbreak anything.\n\nLong story short, if you're in the market for a tablet I strongly recom! end the nexus 7. The combination of quality, function, and price can't be beat."}

My only negative is that it is kind of hard to turn on and off and it is fairly small. I think if you have smaller hands and are a child, this is a good deal. I prefer the size of my iPad mini, but the Nexus has a lot better picture and seems a bit faster.\nIt is very lightweight and I bought a case for it and it does seem to make it a bit safer. It is quite a bit cheaper than the iPad mini and definitely worth the money if cost is a factor for you. If the Nexus was the same size as an iPad mini, I definitely would suggest buying it without a doubt. I would recommend that you physically use one before buying it. Check it out at some store it possible and get a feel for it before you plop down all the money. The size of it may be a factor for you."}

My office uses google docs so I thought the Nexus 7 might have better google docs integration since it is a google product. I also wanted to save a few $$.  My first impression was more negative than positive.  I liked the form factor, look feel etc... but I was used to apple products so it wasn't that intuitive to me.  I thought I need to give it time and learn the new OS.  One thing I didn't like was the battery life.  I could not get more than 1 day out of the battery life even with low use.  I tried all of the advice from their website but battery life never improved.\n\nAfter several months of use I must prefer the apple OS.  More intuitive for me.  The one thing that is inexcusable is the battery life.  Within the last month the battery life has gotten worse.  I get 2 to 3 hours max. This makes the device unusable for work.  I have spent the last hour and a half trying to figure out how to get service.  The entire service process is terrible.  Very convoluted like they have a goal to discourage service requests by making the process hard to figure out and slow."}

I have used both the Nexus 7 and the new iPad Mini with Retina Display. I own both Apple and Android devices. For me personally, I prefer the Nexus 7 though I see the appeal of both. ]\n\nFirst of all, I've had zero issues with my Nexus 7 that I've owned for about a month and a half now. Other users complained of GPS issues (which i believe have been corrected with updates), screen flicker, etc. I've had none of these. I also prefer the selection of the Google Play store vs the Apple App store. Some of my favorite features of the Nexus 7 are the built in GPS, the customization options (home screen, widgets, etc), Ok Google, Qi (wireless) charging, Google Currents, Google Talk integration, Google Play Music, being able to gain root access to the device, and I prefer the size of the Nexus (I can throw it in my pocket).\n\nAt the same time, if you want a very simplified locked down interface, don't care about customization etc the Mini is also a very nice device. I'm a techie, I like to fiddle with things and like to have control of my device. That is why I prefer the new Nexus."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "This is my very first Amazon review.  I figured this would be a good item to start with.  For background, I'm both an Apple and Android user.  My phone is an HTC One.  I sold my Nexus 7 (2012) to purchase this one.  Here are the reasons why:\n\nForm factor - right way, you can tell the Nexus 7-2 is thinner and weighs a little less.  This is important to me as I hate holding tablets, especially my iPad.\n\nSpeed - I read reviews where the benchmarks for the new Nexus are twice as fast as the original.  It clearly shows as I have very little lag.  On the Nexus 7-1, I noticed lag when I surfed the web and the pages were data heavy.  I absolutely hate trying to scroll down a page when it's lagging.  The Nexus 7-2 has very little lag.  In fact, it's almost indistinguishable from my HTC One in terms of speed.\n\nScreen - the resolution is night and day between Nexus 7-2 and Nexus 7-1.  It's almost like switching from a non-retina Apple to a retina Apple (okay, maybe not that extreme but it's pretty close).\n\nSlimport - This is one of the main reasons I upgrade.  With the slimport, you can just plug in the optional adapter and watch Netflix, Dish Anywhere, Hulu, etc. on your big screen television through HDMI.  This saves me from having to pay a monthly fee for another receiver.\n\nOther perks - The speakers are supposed to be better but I don't turn them up high enough to notice a difference.  Also, the camera on the tablet is worthless to me as I don't use it.\n\nOverall, Slimport was the reason for the upgrade for me.  The speed and resolution and night and day compared to the original.  You can sell your original on Amazon and upgrade to the new edition for roughly $40-$60.  If you're currently happy with your original Nexus, then there's no need to upgrade.  For a techie guy like myself, I can't see myself going back to the original version.  The extra $50 is clearly worth it to me as I'll save more than that from my cable receiver rental fees."}

Shattered the screen.\n\nI thought it was a good product...up to the point that I had the misfortune of trying to get it repaired by ASUS, the manufacturer. The experience was unbelievably terrible.\n\nI had to make multiple calls to ASUS in my attempt to get the tablet repaired. I was doubtful it would be worth it, but hesitatingly changed my mind after I called ASUS support and was told the repair would be $150, including shipping. That was just cheap enough to justify going ahead with it. The first representative quoted me the price --  -- but attempted to put me on hold and dropped my call. On my second call, I received an identical quote from a different support person ($150 to repair the product, including labor and shipping.) I asked explicitly if that would be the total cost -- it was not much less than the cost of a new tablet -- and I was told \"yes, it would be.\"  I was issued an RMA. After I shipped the unit to ASUS (at my cost) I waited over a month before receiving any confirmation. This came in the form of an invoice by email that was much higher than the repair cost I was given over the phone. The new quote included tax, shipping and labor charges. (The California sales tax was added to the part PLUS the repair charges, even though labor to repair an item isn't subject to CA sales tax). The total came out to about $200, 33 percent higher than what I was told on the phone, and almost identical to the  price of a brand new Nexus.\n\nI sent an email reply to ASUS to complain, but it was ignored. After several more weeks, I was sent notice that the product was being returned to me for non-payment of the repair invoice.  In all, this process took more than two months, with nothing to show for my trouble but a shipping expense.\n\nThis was terrible service on every level: slow, misleading and unfairly priced (sales tax doesn't apply to repair labor in California). I actually liked the Nexus 7 product, before I broke it, but considering the horrible ASUS customer support,  I will not replace it with another one."}

Performance of the Nexus 7 was another matter.  Less than 90 days after booting the Nexus 7, the touch screen functions completely froze.  I could not even turn the tablet off to preserve a charge on the battery.\n\nIf this was a one-person problem,  it would be bad enough.  However, a Google search identified dozens of videos and owner complaints about problems with X screen freezes and touch screen failure.  Google's response to customer complaints was \"a fix is being developed and will be available for upload\".  Perhaps a helpful solution if a customer could log in to the Nexus 7, which I could not.\n\nOne offered solution was to do a factory reboot which completely erased all owner data.  Not a helpful suggestion when you have spent 2 months adding 10 Gigs of pictures, documents, and other personal data.\n\nSo, a warning to those thinking about purchasing a Nexus 7.  Read some reviews and watch videos about Nexus 7 screen problems before you purchase.\n\nI now have a useless $249 tablet tucked away in a drawer, and plan to go to an Apple Mini IPad like my wife purchased.\n\nSummary:  Good purchasing experience , horrible and frustrating user experience."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I recently purchased a second generation, 32 GB, Nexus 7 with a leather case (and Bluetooth Keyboard), and a mUSB - HDMI adapter for a total of approximately $450; and it was one of the best purchases that I've made in the last three or four years. I used the Nexus on both of my travel days as a media streaming device (local content through MXPlayer, and streamed content through Netflix), e-reader (Kindle App), and gaming device (Air Control and World of Goo). Both travel days consisted of about twelve hours of intermittent use, about thirty minutes of charging over lunch, and about four hours of WiFi connection.\n\nDuring the two days of my conference, I used my Nexus (and keyboard) as a word processing unit. The Keyboard took a little getting used to (mostly due to the absurd key requirement to type the character '), but both devices never showed any sign of distress after being used as a defacto laptop for eight hours of relatively intense note taking. After my conference, I would then retreat to my room, hook my Nexus up to the HDMI port of the TV, and watch Netflix until dinner.\n\nAt the end of the day, my phone would be at about 13% (used only for texting and light browsing over lunch) and the Nexus at about 28%. The speed isn't what I would call \"blazing fast\"- but that's mostly because I am a spoiled elitist and \"blazing fast\" is basically predicting what I want, before I want it, and then doing it. Short of that, the tablet was superb in doing what it needed to do in a timely fashion.\n\nSetting the tablet up was a breeze. It was recognized by MediaMonkey, making importing my 5GB of playlists very intuitive; the importing of the movies (16GB) was a little more time consuming; and the syncing of Google Apps and preferences was seamless. Total setup time was about six hours, to include initial charging, and only about two hours of hands-on interaction."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "This tablet is quick--much snappier than my nexus 10 and every bit as wonderful as my nexus 4.  It runs preliminary builds (4.3 binaries) of android 4.4 AOSP amazingly well--impressively smooth and responsive.  The touchscreen is working perfectly while running android 4.4 (also tested with a touchscreen test app to verify).  I have not had one random reboot.  Cannot wait to see how well the official Google 4.4 factory image performs when it is released.\n\nWireless works well and doesn't drop.  I haven't had a chance to test Bluetooth.  Screen is sharp and really bright-- a lot brighter than the screen on the nexus 10.  Battery seems sufficient, I have used the tablet throughout the day for classes at college and the battery didn't require a recharge until late in the evening.  Haven't tested the camera because the 4.3 camera binaries aren't working with 4.4.  If I remember, I will update this review once an official 4.4 image is released for this tablet.\n\nWhen running 4.3, I had no random reboots but the touchscreen responsiveness didn't as optimized as it is on 4.4.  I wouldn't call it unusable (it was tolerable), but the difference was fairly noticeable after upgrading.  However, I do feel they have finally gotten it dialed in with 4.4, at least on my unit.  Overall I am happy with the purchase and do not regret it one bit."}

It works great for watching uTube or Netflix, reading books or magazines, or casual web surfing, but accuracy of the touch interface is often poor and frustrating. I bought this mostly to access certain web sites containing many links and buttons, but it continually thinks I'm touching someplace else, sometimes with unfortunate consequences. It would be funny if it wasn't so frustrating. I often have to zoom in a long way to get it to select the link that I want. I have a 4 inch Samsung media player (no longer sold and basically a 4 inch tablet) that is easier to navigate web pages with than this Nexus 7.  I should have spent much more time in the store testing the screen and comparing it with other offerings. I wish I had taken the money spent on this and applied it to the purchase of a Surface Pro. Because of the inaccuracy of the touch screen and the importance of that for my use, and for that alone, I would not purchase this again."}

However, the touch screen is much less sensitive than the ipad.  We have to tap things several times often.  When typing (and inevitable) editing on Evernote, the touch sensitivity is so random that the tablet ends up rearranging and cutting a bunch of texts!

Battery last long enough and it's dimensions are great. Too bad it's so fragile.\n\nCons:\n\nSo why only 1 star? I am a deployed soldier and I almost never write reviews, but I was so urked by Asus I felt the need to.\n\nI bought this device specifically to be able to Skype my wife and 3 yr old daughter back home. You can imagine how upset I was when I pulled out my 30 day old Nexus 7 and the screen had a couple hairline cracks, making it unusable (wouldn't respond to touch anymore). Anyone who has dropped a device before knows that screens shatter when dropped. Mine looks pristine and it's obvious that the device wasn't dropped or slammed into anything.\n\nThese devices do not have a durable frame at all. One thing that has always bothered me about this device is how much you can flex it by holding the corners and twisting. (Look up reviews for this thing. There's one where they did a drop test. Most tablets can survive at least a couple drops. This thing didn't even survive one!)\n\nI contacted Asus and 1st they told me to contact the seller (unfortunately it wasn't Amazon. I wish it had been now because I'm sure that they actually care about soldiers seeing their families back home). The seller said it was out of their return period so they couldn't do anything.\n\nI contacted ASUS again. This time they said it was \"physical damage\" so I would have to pay $160 + shipping to have it fixed. That's 60% the cost of the tablet!\n\nThis was my first and LAST Asus purchase. From now on, I'm only purchasing from companies that actually stand behind their products and the troops. I'm just glad I have good friends over here that will let me borrow their stuff..."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "I made the decision to purchase the 2nd gen Nexus 7 after a test drive on a display unit, and comparing it to other similar tablets from competing brands. This unit is easy to handle in one hand, and is perhaps one of the lightest tablets in the market. The display resolution is very sharp, comparable (if not better) to Apple's Retina displays. It is capable of video playback at 1080p Full HD. Music quality is reasonably good. This tablet also comes with stereo speakers, located at the top and bottom sides, which makes watching videos or listening to music quite enjoyable without using earbuds, although you would have to be in a rather quiet area. Apps load and perform fast, even when compared to my Samsung Galaxy S3 which also has a quad core CPU. Cable connectivity is via micro USB, so getting replacement cables will be easy.\n\nNow, the weak points of the Nexus 7. Both front and back facing cameras are very average. The back camera is 5MP, and even in broad daylight outdoors, the quality of photos taken are not as good as other tablets. The camera app's auto focus is finicky, and seems to have trouble getting the right focus. The front camera is 1.2 MP, so needless to say, don't expect Full HD video conferencing. Compared to other brands, the Nexus 7 doesn't come with its own Task Manager, and File Manager, so if you need access to the file system or to view / kill running tasks, you would need to download the apps off Play Store. I felt that the default collection of apps to be rather \"bare\", but it isn't a deal breaker as earlier mentioned, many good 3rd party apps are available.\n\nNote: I found out that the tiny hole next to the volume controls is actually the mic.

Well the GPS did not work without an internet connection so that failed miserably.  Support had me reset the device and do a bunch of stuff that has nothing to do with defective hardware, after doing all that they had me send it in for RMA through ASUS support.  Well that didn't fix it and they sent he tablet back loose in the shipping box.\n\nI was directed to customer support when I contacted the RMA office and said the problem isn't fixed.  After about an hour with support and many, \"I under stand how frustrating it is for your _______ not to be working.\"  A set line to say, GPS was inserted.  The resolution is I must send it back to RMA and they will not send a replacement ahead.  So I am sure that the unit will be returned to me defective again and the original purpose of the unit was for travel...yes it is very frustrating when your gps/research unit does not work as advertised when you are in an unknown area."}

It's my first tablet, and I have been extremely satisfied with it.\n\nI am a Mechanical Engineering student at a technical school, and I use my tablet daily for productivity, note taking, and entertainment consumption. I use it to take notes in some of my classes, and it acts as my organizer, calendar, and tasks-list.\n\nFirst, I'll start with the cons, and save the best for last:\n-I pre-ordered my first Nexus 7, and it crapped out in about two weeks. I think I just got a lemon, as I have not had any issues with my current tablet. Not necessarily a con, but worth noting.\n-Not as \"snappy\" as an iPad, but that is just because Android is an open-ended system. I MUCH prefer Android over Apple, however, that is just my preference. I have not really had to many latency related issues with this tablet. All of the other android devices that I've used have had issues freezing up or randomly shutting off, but nothing of the sort has happen with this tablet...built I digress...\n-Camera isn't the best, but I don't really think a tablet camera is that usable anyway.\n\nPros:\n-I love the HD screen. It's very clear, and great for reading and watching videos, as well as playing games.\n-Speakers are AWESOME. Not a lot of base...but if one of your biggest demands from a tablet is heavy base, you might want to rethink your purchase, or get some good speakers or headphones. :P\n-So easy to use; great touch response, well though-out control and volume-rocker placement, and so many other things make it so effortless to use, unlike lots of other tablets on the market. This is such a balanced piece of equipment.\n\nThere are so many other great things about this tablet, but the best way to find out is to go get one!

Honestly, there are many reviews which will tell you why this is a great tablet, so I will focus in the negatives. There are two things, which made me give this product ONLY 4 stars.\nFirst one is that when I lay my tablet screen up on tha table it doest perfectly touch the surface of the table. The top part (where the camera and flash are) seems to be 0.5-1 mm above the table. I checked a few other Nexus 7 in stores and it seems that I am just the unlucky one. It doesnt affect the performance and day-to-day use in any way, but sometimes I remember about it and it ruins the perfection of the tablet.\nSecond reason is that the middle right part of the screen (portrait view) is not working perfectly when it comes to gestures.

Comparing the two you can really see a difference:\n\nPROS:  It has a great screen; Very thin, very light, very easy to hold and grip in one hand, yet it still feels solidly built; if you've bought into the Google universe, services like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, etc. are all fully integrated with accompanying voice commands; fairly accurate voice recognition; good battery life; tons of apps to choose from; front and rear cameras; mini-USB so no special wires or adapters; tough (I dropped it off my couch onto a wood floor with no ill effects); wireless charging.\n\nCONS:  It's SLOW; the touchscreen is much trickier to use than an iPad's - you wind up tapping multiple times to get it to do anything; if you're not fully invested in the Google universe of services then you miss out on some of the best functionality; no memory card slot; the rear 5MP camera isn't very good and gets grainy in low light; the volume rocker switch is close to the power button and a few times I've accidentally put the tablet into rest mode when trying to change the volume; it takes a long time to charge the battery; the auto-dimmer feature leaves the screen too dark.  If you're not careful the mini-USB connector will break pretty easily, which is when wireless charging helps a lot.\n\nNote that of the 32GB of memory only 26GB is usable out of the box."}

I been using the nexus 7 all day for 3 weeks so far and had no issues. you may hear of crash problems others had but no matter what product you buy there are going to be defects. also the people most likely to write a review's are people who either live this thing or has a problem with it. every one in between who are satasified prob won't say a thing so we are missing many positive feedbacks because they won't take the time to publish. I also noticed that some people claim the screen cracks for no reason and I really think that is bs. has it occurred to those people they damaged it by accident without them knowing or maybe someone else used it without permission and damaged it or it could of been damaged by the carrier during shipping. sorry for bad grammar but typing in a tiny android phone. in summery, the nexus 7 have me more happiness than other technology I own that cost much more money.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "This is a review for the Nexus 7 32GB wifi only tablet.\n\nSo I gave had this tablet now for close to 3 months and can now give some feedback. It was not looking too good for the Nexus 7 when the first device I got from Amazon stopped accepting a charge 6 days after I received it.  However, as usual Amazon was amazing with their customer service and even sent me a new one before I had sent back the defective model.  The replacement Nexus 7 has never had a problem so I understand every product has a few defective units made and my first Nexus 7 just happened to be one of those few so I will not hold this against Google.\n\nPros:\n\nThe whole tactical experience of the Nexus 7 is just amazing.  This device just feels \"right\" when you are holding it.  It fits perfectly in my hand, has nice rounded corners and very sensible soft rubber back (I really wish Apple would use soft rubber backs as they do not scratch and the tend to stay in place better on things like your car dashboard).\n\nThe screen is just incredible compared to the iPad Mini (which I own as well - although to be honest I have not used the iPad Mini in over month since this tablet has replaced the iPad Mini as my everyday tablet).  The resolution is perfect and you would be hard pressed to find a valid criticism of the screen.\n\nThe battery life is pretty impressive.  Now I do not use this tablet to watch very many videos so my battery life might not be indicative of everyone's but I can go a solid 2 days sometimes 3 days before it needs to be charged.  And the charger it comes with seems to be a rapid charger as it fully charges in under 3 hours which is much better then either my iPad or Ipad Mini.\n\nThis tablet seems to me to be very fast.  So I am not a techy who benchmarks performance, but from personal observation it is seems much faster then the iPad Mini when playing games.\n\nThis tablet is just incredibly light and it makes it very easy to always bring it along.  It weighs practically nothing and as a result I find myself never leaving the tablet behind and I bring it with me everywhere.\n\nGoogle Now is simply the perfect electronic assistant.  Yes, I know Google Now is available on iPhone, but the iPhone version does not have the full functionality of the Android version and Google Now has become essential to my everyday life.\n\nThe cost of the 32GB version was $270.  This is half the cost of the iPad Mini and it is a better device in my opinion.  I don't know how they could be making money on this tablet at that price point, but that is Google's problem.  As a consumer, I love the super low price.\n\nNegatives:\n\nIt required a couple updates right when turned on and I would expect this to have zero updates out of the box.\n\nThe Android ecosystem of apps is the Wild West and hence you are likely to get several apps that are adware or malicious.  I highly suggest the first app that you download be Lookout as it screens apps that might have these characteristics.\n\nNo SD card slot.  Adding an SD card slot to the Nexus 7 would seem to be a no brainer, but alas they have not added one.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis tablet has blown me away.  I mostly bought it out of curiosity, but it has become my go to tablet for everyday use.  I think it is perfect for browser the Internet and playing games.  However, if you are heavy video watcher on tablets you might want to make sure the screen is big enough for you to enjoy watching videos.  I cannot recommend this tablet enough - they hit a home run with this device and still it costs half the price of the next best \"mini\" tablet .  Buy with confidence."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "Despite being heavily immersed in Google Apps-I've had an Android phone since 2.1 and I use a Chromebook for 80% of my computing-I have held off on getting an Android tablet as they've seemed compromised until now. After reading the first reviews of this Gen 2 Nexus 7 I took the leap and picked a 32gb model up from my local Staples. I purchased another the next day for my wife as she insisted on one as soon as she saw it. Yes there was an immediate over the air update that I guess resolved a lot of the issues I've been reading about, but I'm honestly surprised by all of the complaints especially given we have 2 in the house without problems.\n\nI honestly could not be happier with the Nexus 7. I use it for media consumption YouTube, Netflix, Kindle, Flipboard, Currents, Google Play Movies and Music. Google Play Music All Access is a real game changer. And I also use it at work to keep track of my notes on Google Keep and check out YouTube videos using Chromecast on the big screen.\n\nMy kids who have iPad Minis are coveting their parents' Nexus 7s b/c of the size and screen mainly. They are actually finding Android 4.3 more open to use believe it or not, and we keep a family gmail account so we can share apps and content across our Android devices.\n\nBig Pros:\n\nBattery life - I used it for 2 movies and several hours of reading and music on a transatlantic flight and only made a 20% dent in the battery\nScreen - bright and clear as only an iPad can dream of\nSize - 7 inch letterbox form factor is perfect to hold as a book (I read with it every night!) and with the right case great for movies etc.\nNot an Apple device so you aren't walled in.\nCHROMECAST - this is a gamechanger. Don't hesitate to buy with the Nexus 7.\nPrice: $300 incl tax for 32gb is hard to beat compared to what else is out there.\nStock Android 4.3 - super clean to use and snappy!\n\nCons:\nScreen glass seams to pick up even light scratches more than my Galaxy S4 phone - get a protector immediately - I didn't!\nMicro USB is a bit finicky but at least pretty much everyone has one if you need it.\nNo SD card - while its not been an issue I like the convenience of having an SD card on my phone especially for sharing files.\nLack of Flash - only an occasional inconvenience though.\n\nIf you are using Google Apps / Cloud products and unless you are heavily invested in Apple's App store there's absolutely no reason to not consider a Nexus 7 over iPad mini. And combined with Chromecast its a pretty unbeatable and compelling media device."}

The colors on the screen don't look vibrant.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "My first entry to tablet ownership was the original Nexus 7, late last December.  Great device, but the Nexus 10's amazing display drew me in, so I traded up.\n\nBut... that Nexus 7 form factor is tough to beat.  Easy to hold in one hand, lightweight.  The Nexus 10, although beautiful, is neither of those after 20 or so minutes of use without propping it.  I reasoned if I had the 7's form factor with the 10's display quality, it'd be a winner.  So I bought the newer 7.\n\nWow.  The screen is just as beautiful as the Nexus 10, just smaller.  Holding my Nexus 7 at comfortable arm's length, I'm seeing a bigger screen than my 52\" Samsung LCD HDTV across the room -- and still seeing the same number of pixels.  So, for many applications, the Nexus 7 display is quite enough space.\n\nThe rear-facing 5MP camera is really not that bad, and fills one of the earlier 7's gaps.  I didn't buy it for that camera, but I'd rather have a decent camera than none at all.  Haven't tried front-facing camera yet for video calling, but it also looks to be very serviceable.\n\nSpeakers - not front-facing as I'd hoped (I really like the Nexus 10 for this), but they are stereo, and they do a FAR better job than the first-gen 7's speakers.\n\nVery smooth and responsive user experience.  Even smoother than the Nexus 10.\n\nBattery life is impressive.  WiFI performance is great.  I just really can't find fault with this tablet.  It's a great intro tablet (particularly at the 16 GB price point), and I've not seen any of the instability issues mentioned elsewhere.\n\nJust go for it.  It's a great little device."}

I still like the Transformer for its keyboard/dock solution, but it's about 2 years old now and its performance shows it. Battery life on the Nexus has been good, GPS has worked fine for me, wireless performance is very good (especially compared with the Transformer), etc.\n\nI also picked up a Moko case for it and they work very well together. The speakers are great on the unit as is, but the case enhances the audio even more.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, I'd say a microSD slot would have been a solid addition and I wish there was a way to do native mini HDMI without an adapter.

There were many occasions when I had to hit a link, button, or keyboard \"key\" multiple times before it would register.  I've seen other complaints about this online, so I'm not sure if the problem is a defective unit, bad design, or bad software.\n\n2. I've experienced a number of software crashes -- programs freezing or exiting mysteriously.  Most of these occurred in programs that came with the device -- I did not keep it long enough to download a lot of third-party apps.\n\n3. In general, navigating this thing and setting up the settings I want were MUCH less intuitive on this version of Android  than on iOS devices.\n\nIt's possible that all three problems were software and will get fixed in future updates.  In that case, it would be a great device at a great price.  But I can't be sure of that, so I decided to return it within the 30-day window."}

But I seem to have received a good unit, no such problems. When comparing to the 2012 model, it's a huge improvement in almost any regard:\n- The new screen is much better than the old one, brighter and better resolution.  Also, the new screen doesn't flicker anymore at low brightness settings.\n- Noticeable improvement in CPU speed. Qualcomm makes much better SOCs than nvidia, much snappier and no lag anymore. I can't emphasize how much  more enjoyable this tablet is to use compared to the old one.\n- Much improved storage speed, programs install much faster and finally no lag anymore during normal usage.\n-  Battery life is much better, lasts noticeably longer than the old model. The only quibble I have i have that the battery seems to drain a little faster when idle. Eg, 6% over night, even with WiFi, GPS, background data, etc. turned off. Maybe they will fix that in some software update.\n- They fixed issue with light sensor reading being all over the place, making auto brightness more reliable.\n- Lighter, nicer form factor, and sturdier feel.\n- Stereo speakers are nice, max volume much better than previous model.\n- The old model had the nasty habit of skipping music playback while e.g. surfing the web. New one also doesn't do this anymore.\n- Headphone jack on top much more practical.\n\nOverall, if you have the first generation Nexus 7 and any of the issues listed above bother you, don't hesitate to upgrade, you won't be disappointed."}

So far this tablet has performed very well.  Picture quality is excellent and I can download so many more apps.  It charges up really fast when not in use.  But still charges up faster than the Kindle Fire when I am using it and charging at the same time.  And the battery stays charged for a longer time.  One charge will last 38 + hours on standby.  The touch screen is a more responsive than the Kindle Fire.  The keyboard is quick to respond.\n\nOf course, there are times when the touch screen does not respond as well.  But I believe that is caused by the stylus wearing down.  I will see, because I bought some more styluses to try out.  Fiber mesh styluses.  So that is the one issue I have, right now, with the Nexus.  However, with the new fiber mesh stylus, I have not had any respond issues with the touch screen.  So I beliee I solved that problem.  The same thing also happened on my Kindle Fire.  But all-in-all, this is a very good tablet.  I like the way it responds with a good stylus pen and I love the sound quality and picture quality and the size.  I do not like gigantic tablets.  Oh, and one can set the wi-fi to go off when the tablet is in sleep mode and it comes right back on when I start using it again.  So I can really conserve energy this way."}

If you did not buy the tablet directly from the Google Play store, then you have to have it serviced by Asus (and you have to pay to ship it out to them).  UPS shows Asus received my tablet on 10/3/13 (RMA USG7397854).  Asus says they need 5-7 days to evaluate and repair.  It is now 10/18/13.  I have spoken with two separate supervisors and neither has been able to give me a definitive update as to when I can expect to receive it back.  The first supervisor actually told me that there may be a \"discrepancy with the case\" and that I may be charged for repairs?! Don't know how that is possible for an item still completely under warranty and only a few weeks old that is otherwise in mint condition but I found that statement to be pretty ridiculous.  The second supervisor says that it will take 1-2 business days to get a response from the repair facility.  Again, very poor customer service.  This is my second Nexus 7 tablet (still own the 2012 first generation) and also have an Asus UX31a ultrabook.

The Nexus 7 is the perfect size and fits in my hand comfortably.  The size is the reason I bought this tablet.  But it's not the reason I love it so much.  The screen is brilliant and the speakers are amazing.  Normally, with most mobile devices, I struggle to hear music or movies with the volume up all the way.  With my phone or other tablet if I don't have an external speaker to pump sound through, it's not worth watching a movie.  With the Nexus 7, I have to turn the volume down slightly.  Oh joy!  Rapture!  A device with more than adequate sound!  I've never experienced such a mobile device before!\n\nOther than that, the device is beautiful and comfortable.  Top notch!\n\nBut it's not all roses.  There are a few things to nitpick.  There's no micro HDMI port so even though the Nexus 7 is great to watch movies on if I'm not in front of TV, I'll still need my TF700T if I want to watch movies on a TV while on the road say at a hotel or at my parents house.  Then there's the lack of microSD card support.  There's not enough room on the device for all my music and because this is the wifi only version, I'm not always going to have access to my music on the cloud.\n\nThese minor drawbacks prevent me from giving it 5 stars...but I knew these things going into the purchase.  Overall, a fantastic tablet that I'd recommend to anyway."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "While I basically use my iPad as a mini-laptop, I needed a smaller device that could be held in one hand for reading e-books and web-surfing.  Plus, I needed a tablet (unlike the iPad) that I could load Adobe Flash Player onto for playing online Flash video and using Flash-based websites.  (Adobe Flash is no longer \"officially\" supported on Android tablets, but the application can easily be downloaded from several developer websites and still runs well on the new Nexus 7).  I spent quite awhile researching and trying to decide between the Nexus 7 and the Samsung Tab 3 (8-inch), but I ended up choosing this device because I wanted a \"pure Android\" OS, and the Nexus seemed like it would be easier to hold in one hand, being a slightly smaller/narrower device.\n\nIn terms of pure esthetics, the Nexus 7 is a gorgeous tablet.  It's slim, sleek and shiny (on the front; the back is made of a grippier material that keeps it from slipping out of your hand).  The screen is a thing of beauty: Colors are bright and crisp, and video and photos \"pop\" off the screen.  The high resolution display is ideally suited to playing HD video.  There are also a plethora of apps from the Google Play store that make this a very handy little device.\n\nHowever, the benchmark of a real quality computer -- be it a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone -- is that it should function smoothly and seamlessly, with a minimum of glitches.  Unfortunately, this is where the Nexus 7 falls short.  I've had this device for about a month now, and at least 3-4 times per week, it freezes and/or crashes.  Apps will suddenly stop working and close, or the touch screen will become unresponsive, requiring me to shut down the device and restart it.  Also, the Google touchscreen keyboard is buggy and often slow to respond to taps, especially when entering text in web browser apps like Chrome and Firefox.\n\nThe above glitches don't happen enough for me to declare my Nexus 7 a total \"lemon,\" but they are pretty annoying when they happen.  And they happen too frequently for me to give the Nexus 7 a wholehearted recommendation.  Hence my 3 star rating.\n\nFinally, the lack of a microSD card slot is a significant omission on the Nexus 7. Apps are pretty memory-intensive on their own, and if you're planning on storing your music collection or HD movies/TV shows on your Nexus, even 32gb of onboard memory can get eaten up pretty quickly. It would've been great if the Nexus 7 had included a microSD slot for expanding the device's memory. That said, thanks to a nifty 3rd party device called the Meenova Mini Micro SD Card Reader (please Google it), it is possible to expand the file storage capacity of the Nexus 7. The Meenova looks like a tiny thumb drive, except that it holds a microSD card of up to 32gb, and it plugs into the microUSB port on the Nexus. Ideally, the Nexus 7 would have an internal microSD card slot, but in the absence of that, the Meenova is a good work-around.\n\nGrade: C"}

You would have to use the power button to restart the device.  Two other irritating issues:  1) The edges of the device are not rounded, but instead are pointed with a 90 degree angle making holding the device annoying.  Not sure why they would design a device that people are going to hold by the edges (with one hand) and not make the edges rounded. Sigh.  2) There's a full INCH of space above and below the screen for some weird reason.  Why?  As I'm looking at the screen I'm just thinking, why is 2 full inches of this device wasted with empty space.\n\nSo I returned this for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, 8 inch.  I just like the Samsung design better.  The device has rounded edges, no wasted space, a physical \"home\" button, microSD card expansion.  It may not be quite as powerful or have as good a resolution as the Nexus, but who cares, the drawbacks of the Nexus aren't worth those benefits in my opinion."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00DVFLJKQ", "review": "When this tablet worked correctly, it was a pleasure to use. It fits very nicely in your hand, and has great visual quality. This is my second Nexus 7 tablet, and unfortunately both had similar problems.  The first issue had to do with the tablet arbitrarily shutting down for no reason.  Both tablets have this issue, and when the tablet shuts down I lose the work I have on screen.  That alone is very annoying, but it also is very slow to restart.  Over time the shutdowns have become more frequent, and the current tablet is now shutting down almost every time I use it.  Secondly, the touch screen has been losing sensitivity, and doesn't always respond to touch.  Third is an issue with recharging.  Both tablets reached a point where they wouldn't recharge, although the recharging cords and connections worked fine on all my other devices.  On the first tablet I ended up having the battery replaced, and this seemed to help that particular issue.  It did not help, however, with the random shutdowns.  I had the first tablet for close to four years, before these problems overcame its usefulness.  The current tablet is barely 6 months old, refurbished, and had a one month warranty.  In retrospect it would have been better to not purchase the refurbished product since I really haven't saved any  money.  I contacted ASUS to address my problems, but ASUS did not have any record of this refurbished device's serial number.  In other words they didn't warrant a third party refurbishment.  Since I did not receive any information on the refurbishment with my purchase, I couldn't follow up with that approach. A fourth issue with the current tablet is the screen brightness.  The light arbitrarily dims and returns to bright.  Much as I enjoy this tablet when it works, I'm going to have to find a more reliable product in the future.  I like an analog system, but haven't really seen any tablets that match this device for the size and convenience."}

Then, a couple of months ago, I had to have the charge port replaced, because the design of the tablet does not afford adequate protection, and the shell had become deformed. Got it back ($85 later!) and the touch system was messed up. Took it in again, they reseated a cable, and that resolved the issue with the touch system, but just two days later, it bricked itself, and the service center declares it unrepairable. It was too expensive in the first place, to be so poorly supported. It has put me off ASUS, at least, for mobile devices, and the service company they license to make repairs."}

It's an older product and I'd say it ages all right. I'll just say this, it does what I want it to do, watch YouTube and Netflix. But that's about it, and it barely does that now. There's issues in YouTube that are still persistent even after a factory reset. It doesn't play 1080p 60 FPS (it's not even an option) but it does do 720p 60 FPS, but the video often freezes while audio continues to play. Only in 60 FPS mode for YouTube. It's not great for web browsing anymore, it's quite slow, and it doesn't play modern 3d games well but that's ok. The two best things this tablet has is the beautiful screen with amazing colors with a resolution ahead of it's time (1920x1200) and stock android (the best android). My two biggest issues (now three in the past five minutes) is that the screen has issues auto rotating. It's been like this for a couple of years and I think it's because the sensors are wonky. With a gyro sensing app, it shows that this device isn't detecting any movement. A restart usually fixes it but it breaks shortly after. Another thing that always breaks is that it doesn't detect touch. Sometimes I can't tap anything, or even unlock it because it doesn't detect my finger. Turning the screen off and on again usually fixes this problem except for today, a few minutes ago. Coincidentally as I'm writing this review, It wasn't detecting touch and I couldn't even press the power off option so I had to force shut it down. Now it won't boot, I keep getting stuck at the \"Google\" screen. I've had this for well over 3 years and the time it breaks is when I'm writing a review! I'm sure the internet has information on fixing this. Lastly, I'm surprised the price hasn't changed. In fact I think I got it for less years ago."}
