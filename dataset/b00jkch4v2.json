{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "I already have a Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 but curiosity was killing me; I had to see what the differences were between the two model years. I think the Galaxy Tab 4 8.0 is a great tablet!  I am a Galaxy Tab fan from the beginning.  I still have and use a Sprint Galaxy Tab sph-p100 which is now several years old, but has been tweaked in nearly every way. I have watched the Galaxy Tab line evolve from the beginning. The GT4 8.0 is an evolutionary change from the 3.\n\nThe introductory price was lowered by $30 on the first day of its release and it is currently $60 less than the introductory price of the GT 3 8.0.  To keep the price down other than the processor and the newer operating system there are no other notable improvements and some compromises were made.  The speakers and cameras were downgraded and the data/power cable was shortened.  The cable that was used to output an HDMI signal from the GT 3 8.0 no longer works with the 4.  I find this very disturbing.  Even my original Galaxy Tab has HDMI output through an adapter.  In most ways this was less of a performance upgrade than a response to current market conditions.  Because of the competition in 8\" tablets... at the current price point consumers expect a more modern quad-core processor.  That is what we got.\n\nMy first impressions...\n\nTo me the GT4 8.0 seemed slightly zippier than the GT3 8.0.  However when I ran the applications that I actually use on a tablet most of the time (web browsers, book readers, video and music players) with the two tablets side by side there were no appreciable differences.  So I have to admit that my first impression may have been psychological... knowing that the newer unit has a quad core processor vs a dual core in the GT3 8.0 gives the expectation that the GT4 8.0 would be faster.  I ran approximately 20 benchmark programs on the two tablets side by side. The GT 4 8.0 was faster by most but not all measures.\n\nThe Gtab4 8.0 has the same processor as the Motorola Moto G.  In nearly every benchmark I ran the scores were almost the same as the Moto G.  Since the Moto G has been out longer... if you want to know how the GT4 8.0 is going to perform using a certain benchmark just look at how the Moto G performed; you will most likely be within a very few percentage points.\n\nMost notably on the initial runs using the Antutu Benchmark program... the GT4 8.0 earned a score of 17281 and the GT3 8.0 received a score of 15263.  On the Antutu 3DRating Benchmark the 4 got a score of 2765 and the 3 just 1870. Neither is a speed demon compared to many other Android Devices. Neither tablet is meant to be a maximum performance gaming device.  Overall however both tablets have a lot of features for entry level tablets as noted in other reviews and both are very good, well rounded devices.\n\nCompared to the GT3 8.0, the GT4 8.0 shines running applications which take full advantage of its 4 processors and on chip Graphics Processor Unit. There are benchmarks where the GT3 8.0 outperforms the 4 due to its faster clock speed and the design of its processors and gpu.  Overall, however one must reasonably conclude that the new processor in the 4... future proofs it more as compared to the GT3 8.0. It will be interesting to find out what type of overclocking potential the processors and GPU have.  Whether either unit has any practical real world advantages for the a particular user depends entirely on the applications being used. A budding tablet gamer would be better off with the 4.\n\nMy guess is that most users who do not run 3D games, photo or video editing apps would not be able to tell much if any difference using typical applications.  Unless there are applications that you want to use that you know are CPU intensive and are going to run better on the quad core tablet it would not be a worthwhile upgrade for most.  If however you are making a decision about which tablet to purchase... I would be willing to spend a little more on the GT4 8.0 than the GT3 8.0.\n\nSome advantages of the 3 are:\n1.  It has been out for a while and has a lot of community support.  It is easy to root; there are many custom ROMS and setups that one can take advantage of without having to reinvent the wheel.\n2 .The 3 has loads of cheap accessories available through eBay, Amazon and numerous retailers.\n3. The 3 has better speakers and cameras.\n\nSome advantages of the 4 are:\n1.  It has a newer quad-core processor that out performs the 3 in many benchmarks.\n2.  The Kitkat Operating System... as annoying as it is to have to learn new features... it is an upgrade. There probably already are custom ROMs to upgrade the GT3 8.0, but there are advantages to having a factory supported OEM version with the latest OS.\n3. The back of the 4's case has a faux leather finish that is not a fingerprint magnet like the shiny 3's is.  Personally I never take the 3 out of its gel case because you can't pick it up without getting nasty looking fingerprints all over it's beautiful shiny white exterior.\n4. {{{edit 5-18-14}}} After using the 4 for over two weeks I can report that in its stock configuration plus a couple dozen of my favorite apps, that it seems to have exceptional battery life.  I normally charge most devices that I depend on such as my phone every night.  I haven't charged the Galaxy Tab 4 for several days and have used it regularly, often with the screen at full brightness and the battery is still indicator still shows that it has 64% left. If you leave it in standby mode and don't use it... I can now report that it doesn't seem to lose more than a couple of percentage points of battery life in a day.  I am pleased enough that I raised my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  Kudos to Samsung for not putting a bunch of battery eating fluff in the stock configuration!\n\nSome disadvantages of the 3 are:\n1. Older Operating System.\n2. Dual Core vs Quad Core processor... albeit running at 1.5ghz as opposed to 1.2ghz\n3. The shiny case attracts fingerprints.\n\nSome disadvantages of the 4 are:\n1. Lower quality speaker and cameras.  The speaker is in the back so if you cover it or lay it down flat it will be muffled.  The 3 has great speakers and goes louder to begin with. The 4 doesn't sound bad but it is not as good as the GT3 8.0.\n2. The case has different dimensions than 3 so there are very few custom molded gel cases currently available. This of course should improve within a month or two.\n3. It is so new that currently there is very little support in the tablet community... you will probably have to wait a while to run your favorite applications that require rooting.\n\nI took many pictures and videos of the two units running side by side.  When I get the chance I will try to post those in updates to this review.\n\n{{{Update 10-11-14}}} We have had the Tab 4 since May and it has served us well.  I am disappointed that Samsung still hasn't released a firmware update that would allow one to attach an HDMI adapter to this device and display content on a High Definition Television.  It seems ridiculous considering that all of our Android phones, a $75 Chinese tablet, and our 4 year old  sph-p100 Sprint Galaxy Tab 7 all have working HDMI adapters.  As far as I am concerned Samsung has really dropped the ball on this.  Samsung, why has this still not been corrected after nearly 6 months?\n\n{{{Update 12-02-14}}} One thing that I forgot to mention in my review that has been used a lot by my family is the IR Blaster.  This is a feature on both the Tab 3 and the Tab 4 that allows you to use them as a universal remote control.  I have found that with a $6 App from the Play Store that this is an incredibly useful feature and there is no limit to the number of remotes that you can emulate.  The App that I am using has half a million remotes already in its database.  These can all be customized easily.  It can also learn commands from the IR signal if you have a remote not in the database.  I have got a whole lot of supposedly universal remotes but none seem to work as well or as easily as this feature on the Galaxy Tab.\n\nSo, in conclusion... if you already have a Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 the GT 4 8.0 is most likely not enough of an upgrade to justify purchasing the 4 unless you have a family member who could use a hand me down or any other excuse that you can make up.  If you are looking for a new tablet I would recommend either the 3 or the 4 because of the features they both provide features that have been well covered in other reviews.  I would be willing to pay a little more for the 3 than the 4 but not more than around $30 at this time.  Basically, if you plan to use the tablet for processor intensive applications such as editing photos or playing the latest 3D games you would probably be better off with the 4.  If you want to take pictures with your tablet and like to listen to the built in speakers I would lean towards the 3.  As far as browsing the internet, staying connected, watching videos or looking at pictures I doubt whether you will be able to tell the difference.  Both are good values as far as I am concerned."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "I have the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 and the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 and love them both, so when I read that Samsung was coming out with the Galaxy Tab 4 I just had to try it out.  It arrived within 2 days of ordering it.  I have to say that I am thrilled with it.  Everything about it is fantastic.  From the build quality to the performance it is great.  I love the 8\", it is the perfect size for me.  The back has a very nice faux leather feel, much nicer than the shiny, slippery plastic back on the tab 3.  The screen resolution is very clear and bright.  It is lightning fast, the quad core is much faster than the dual core of the tab 3.  It is just a bit heavier than the tab pro but not uncomfortably so.  It is just a great tablet all around and at $239 it just can't be beat in my opinion.  I own many tablets including the newest Nexus 7, the Kindle Fire HDX and the Galaxy as I mentioned and I love the Samsung products.  This Galaxy Tab 4 is a wonderful new addition to the Samsung line and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a tablet.  And as usual Amazon shipped it very quickly and free shipping with Prime.  A fantastic experience all around!! Forgot to mention that the battery life is incredible!!  I have been using it for the past 2 days, emailing, surfing the web, reading and playing a couple of games and it still has 72% battery life left!!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "I am happy with device so far. KitKat OS is a big improvement over previous versions. Coupled with a snapdragon S5 1.2GHZ processor, and it is very quick. Display is crisp, bright and responsive. Looks like a very large Galaxy S5. Buttons are in the same place as the Galaxy Sx series phones. I added a 32GB microSD card. Back camera takes very good pictures. Could be better, but it is only 3MP. Not sure why Samsung cannot put a decent camera in their tablets. No flash as with most tablets. Their is only one speaker on the lower left (looking at the back). It is pretty load, no greatest sound quality. I find myself accidentally covering it up all the time and with a cover it can sound muffled. Comes with the usual Samsung bloatware. Strangely, it also came with ATT apps. Back cover is awful. Feels very cheap and feels like it will slip out of my hands. I have almost dropped it several times. Ordered a case immediately. This a great machine to use. Unfortunately, Samsung ruined it with a cheap camera, slow charger and slippery back detracting from a solid machine."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "I bought this tablet because I need to learn all mobile operating systems. A guy I know had the Tab 3 which I thought was pretty cool, so I went ahead and bought the Tab 4. I am new to the Android system (being an Apple user) so I am learning how to navigate through everything.\n\nUpon comparing it to the Tab 3, there is not much difference... Pretty much it is just the Android 4.4 (Kit-Kat) and a little faster CPU. Other then that the Tab 4 is a twin of the Tab 3. The camera is better in the Tab 3 (5 MP) and the Tab 4 is (3 MP). Don't know why Samsung would downgrade a newer tablet, but maybe it's the affordable cost, being a faster CPU.\n\nI haven't been able to spend hours into going through everything it offers. But with just what I have been able to see, this is pretty cool tablet. Just wish Samsung would have done a little more."}

A red x appeared over the battery symbol and the tablet appeared to be charging but very slowly. This red x means that the tablet is plugged into a computer and exchanging data but in reality it was plugged into the Samsung AC wall charger using their cable.\n\nI tried another Micro USB charging cable and it worked fine but not every time. I was worried that the charging port on the tablet was going bad. I take excellent care of my smart devices and I wanted to find out what the issue was. I contacted Samsung support using the on line message support system. It took about an hour to convince Samsung that the cable was bad and perhaps the AC wall charger.\n\nThey shipped me a new AC wall charger and the cable. I tried only the cable by itself first and it has worked perfectly every time I haved plugged it in for three weeks. I wanted to post this update in case any other user of this tablet is having a similar problem. Good luck with Samsung support as the person I dealt with was stubborn about recognizing that one of their products was defective.\n\n---------------------\n\nI own a lot of different tablets but this is my first Samsung and let me say that I am impressed.  I went to the store to buy a 7 inch unit but quickly decided to upgrade to the 8 inch version.  There were several features that I was concerned about and the 8 inch unit just fit my needs better.\n\n* Larger screen size for reading\n* More basic internal memory at 16 GIG versus 8 GIG for the 7 inch unit\n* The ability to upgrade to a 64 GIG SD card instead of just 32 GIG\n\nJust remember that in my experience your need for more memory grows as you use your tablet more and if you buy a smaller memory upgrade capability you may regret it.  The price difference on launch day was only $40 more.  I already own 8 tablets in my family so my experience has proven this need for more memory.  As you add more books and more apps the memory slowly gets eaten up.  I went ahead and also purchased a Samsung 64 GIG Micro SD memory card and I got a Class 10 Pro series at a cost of $55.  It reads at 70 MB/s and a write speed of 20 MB/s.  For under $300 you will have a powerful tablet that has more memory (80 GIG) than a 64 GIG iPad Mini for a much lower price.\n\nHere is the link to the Samsung Memory that I purchased:\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-64GB-MicroSD-XC-Pro-Class-10-UHS-1-Read-Speed-70mb-s-Write-Speed-20mb-s-MB-MGCGB-Ultra-Fast-Speed-Memory-Card-with-SoCal-Trade-Inc-Memory-Card-Reader/dp/B00B535XA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung 64GB MicroSD XC Pro Class 10 UHS-1 Read Speed 70mb/s Write Speed 20mb/s MB-MGCGB Ultra Fast Speed Memory Card with SoCal Trade, Inc. Memory Card Reader</a>\n\nSome other key features are:\n\n* A powerful Qualcomm quad core CPU operating at 1.2 GHZ  ( You can see the speed in using the tablet)\n* 1280 by 800 pixel display\n* A 3 MP rear facing camera\n* A 1.3 MP front facing camera\n* It weighs in at 11  ounces per my scales\n* Bluetooth 4.0\n* Internal 16 GIG of flash memory and it goes to 80 GIG using a 64 GIG Micro SD card (Use a high quality Class 10 Micro SD card)\n* 1.5 GIG of internal RAM\n* A 4450 mAh internal battery pack\n* Android 4.4 operating system Kit Kat\n* 1080P playback and recording\n* A built in IR blaster to control your TV and other infra-red devices and an App called WatchON the help you control your TV and see what is playing on your cable service.\n* The tablet comes with a 31 inch charging and data cable that is a Micro USB on one end and a USB on the other.\n* It comes with an AC wall charger that outputs 5 VDC at 1 Amp and it will operate on 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 HZ.\n* It features a power multitasking function that lets you see and use two apps simultaneously which is something that an Apple iPad cannot do. Very nice feature!\n* You can set up multiple users and limit the apps that they can see and use.\n* You can set up a child friendly and protected user interface.\n* You get $300 worth of free content\n\nI found this tablet to be extremely versatile and very fast.  The quad core processor is very impressive and browsing the internet was fast and easy.  Adding my Gmail account to the tablet literally took a minute.  I put together a video to show you the locations for the controls and what the tablet looks like.  It is a bit long and I couldn't even talk about all of the items that I wanted to include. I apologize for the length of the video but I get excited over good technology.  Overall the tablet is impressive and it is well worth the money based on the quality and performance that I have seen.  I rate it as a 5 star item.\n\nYou can register your device with Samsung Galaxy Perks and get more free items:\n\n* A $10 credit on the Google Play Store\n* 3 months free of Hulu plus\n* 1 year free of Boingo WIFI\n* 50 GIG of free Drop Box cloud storage for 2 years\n* Sirius 3 months free\n* 3 free audible books for new members\n* 3 digital magazines free on Zinio for 2 months\n* A free Polaris Office\n\nUpdate May 2, 2014:\n\nLast night I installed the Amazon AppStore and the Amazon Kindle reading app. I down loaded over 950 books and I was blown away by the speed of the downloads.  The CPU and strong WIFI connection really shines with its speed. I was using a strong 2.4 GHz WIFI and I downloaded the speedtest app from Google Play and I could download data at 13.36 Mbps and upload data at 2.09 Mbps. Since I am on ATT Uverse that is a reasonable result. The tablet can use either a 2.4 GHz or a 5 GHz WIFI channel. On the 5GHz frequency I got 17.71 Mbps download and 2.24 Mbps upload.\n\nI used the Amazon AppStore as I own over 1000 apps and it was fast and easy to download many of them. I could transfer them to the SD card to conserve my internal memory. I had to do this manually on some of the apps and others went to the SD card automatically.\n\nThe sound of the speaker is pretty loud for its size. I paired the tablet with a Bluetooth speaker and the process is fast and easy. I use Bluetooth a lot and I was glad to see it work so well and Bluetooth 4.0 is the low power version to help reduce battery consumption.\n\nOver three hours of continuous work the battery dropped from 98% to 62% which is pretty good considering I downloaded over 950 books and 35 apps. I love the fact that I can use my Amazon books and apps so easily and still have access to the Google Play Store to download utilities and apps that are not available on Amazon. It is like having the best of both worlds.\n\nPhotographs are easy to take and edit. I even shot some videos. I wanted to include some in my online video but there was not enough space and time remaining to do so.\n\nUsing an app called Hangouts I was able to do face to face video calls and text messaging with my wife using our gmail account emails. The quality was as good as Facetime and the connection worked very well. I had to install the app Hangouts on my wife's iPhone 5S and the app is free on iTunes. The app was already installed on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4.\n\nI continue to be impressed with the performance and capability of this tablet.\n\nI did want to add that the case is slippery and a little wide to hold so I suggest that you get a case to improve your ability to grip the tablet and hold it."}

The screen resolution is great, the battery life is still pretty good even after all this time, and I love that it has expandable storage (I put a 16GB microSD card in there). The cameras are not very good, but that's a compromise you have to make to get a tablet for under $200. It can play up to 1080p, 30FPS or 720p, 60FPS video smoothly. It cannot play 4K video at any framerate, as it will stutter and probably crash the video player. Again, that's to be expected with a tablet at this price range and suits my needs very well. It can play most games as long as they're not too graphically demanding, though the load times can be a bit long with more modern mobile games.\n\nIf you can find it cheaper now, I'd recommend this to just about anyone who isn't willing or able to spend a ton of money on a tablet."}

I just got a firmware update, and now it charges entirely reliably, as good as new, so this was a firmware problem.  I suspect shenanigans.  I suspect the last update was to get you to upgrade.  Well that won't happen now, I'm done with Samsung.  Nothing on the internet about this sudden fix, but lots of people complaining of the same problem months ago.

This is the perfect size and aspect ratio in my opinion, and Samsung makes some pretty tough and reliable devices.  I've dropped it several times and it's held up, however my friend ended up dropping it face down on some concrete from a higher distance and it did crack the screen (I expected it to be a lot worse).  It's a small crack though and the device still functions fine, which is more than I can say for my LG phone with a small crack (Samsung phone was completely shattered and still worked).  I'm getting a little off topic, but it's a good tablet and I'd buy another one."}

It is a nice size and the android operating system is easy to work, especially if you are already used to an android phone. It fits well in my labcoat pocket and is a nice, convenient tablet.\n\nThe only issue I have with the tablet is not really with the tablet itself. The whole reason I got the tablet was so it would fit in my labcoat pocket and so I could have all of my notes from veterinary school on there as a resource as I entered clinics. My notes are on the OneNote app, which is available on this tablet. The problem is that the OneNote app cannot be put onto the memory card and my notes exceed the size of the tablets internal memory. So I cannot get all the notes on my tablet, and it has issues syncing the notes because of that and because of such a large volume of notes trying to sync over a wireless connection. It would be nice if this tablet had an ethernet port so I could force it to sync but with wireless only I can't really do much. So it mostly sits in my backpack and I still use my laptop. But it was great for BOARDS studying."}

Even though it uses a standard android USB port, it will not charge with any other charger. I travel a lot for work and can't even use my external portable battery to keep it charged while I'm on the road. My son's $50 cheapo tablet can be charged with any standard android charger, but not this $300 tablet? That shows that the capability is there but samsung just wants to keep you buying their far more expensive oem chargers. The tablet works fine itself, but because of this one issue, I will never buy another samsung product. Absolute stupidity!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "I've owned five or so iPhones and an iPad 2. This was my first Android purchase.\n\nI'm not really in love with this tablet for a few reasons:\n\nThe responsiveness of the touch screen is not as good/accurate as any of the apple products I have used.  It was something I never gave a second thought to until owning this tablet. It's not terrible,  just not as good.\n\nThe placement of the two touch sensitive buttons that flank the home button at the bottom of the tablet are in a bad place for me. When I'm laying down and balancing the tablet on my belly,  those buttons get touched accidentally. It's annoying.\n\nThis tablet is too slow,  and I'm comparing it to an iPad 2 that I bought in 2011.\n\nThe resolution is not as good as on my iphone 5s.\n\nThe plastic screen scratches very easily. I purchased a folio case which protects it well. But within the first two days the screen was practically destroyed. I am not rough with my devices... I have NEVER broken an iPhone oriPad screen, or had one scratched to this degree. This screen is too delicate, in my opinion.\n\nOn the positive side, I like the Android OS. I do find it slightly less intuitive than my iOS devices.  There was an app that I wanted that wasn't available on iOS and I felt lucky to have this tablet.\n\nThis tablet was offered to me for 99 cents if I signed it up under my cell contact (plus $10/month data). If I purchased this item for full price I would be very disappointed.\n\nThe bottom line is this: if you can spend the money for an iPad,  get that instead. The top of the line Samsung tablets are probably fantastic.  But this one is just eh."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "We bought 3 of these tablets for our kids for Christmas last year (2014).  They are wonderful for the kids.  There are controls I can use to limit what internet page accesses and purchases from the App store.  They are easy to use and the kids love them.  In March 2015, 3 months after buying them, one of them stopped charging.  We had it serviced and it only worked for a few days.  We thought it was faulty and purchased another one.  This week, the newest one and one of the ones purchased in December stopped charging.  So 3 out of 4 of the tablets have broken.  We tried all \"at home\" methods of trying to fix them - reading blog tips, etc.  I have to send them into Samsung to be serviced but from what I understand the charger port is not covered under any warranty.  So 10 months and 800.00 purchasing 4 tablets later, 3 are broken. They won't be replaced and we have no way of getting our money back.  Before buying this, do a quick google search for \"Samsung tablet stopped charging\" and you will see the hundreds of posts about this problem.  As great as they are when they work, it is not worth the risk.  There are other tablets out there with the same features and of better quality."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "The table itself is okay but I guess having had Kindle Fires with Amazon has spoiled me for customer service.  I bought my Samsung tablet in November 2014 to primarily use to watch movies, etc while I was using my Kindle Fire at the same time for Facebook, etc.  I quickly discovered that even though I am an Amazon prime member and have purchased 10 movies through Amazon Instant video, Amazon does not make it easy to watch videos on a non-Kindle device. It took a bit of research but I was finally able to play MY movies on my Samsung Galaxy 4 Tablet.\n\nMy reason for the 1 star review is based on the warrantee. This tablet comes with a one  year warrantee and I bought the two year Square Trade Warrantee  Five days ago, I was using my Samsung tablet and it started making a faint beeping sound.  I did a downward swipe to check notifications and the tablet just died on me.  Nothing I did to get it to turn back on worked. The next morning, I contacted Square Trade to arrange to get the tablet repaired and was told it was still under warrantee with Samsung and they gave me the number to contact Samsung.  I am at this point beyond frustrated.  If this was a Kindle, I would have probably had a brand new Kindle already delivered.  I called Samsung and eventually got through to the correct person.  For some reason, they kept saying the serial number on my tablet was invalid.  I read it right off of the back of the tablet over and over and over and over and got the same result.  Eventually, I was told to send/upload a copy of my Amazon invoice before i could we could proceed any further.  I received the email and did a screen print of my amazon receipt and both uploaded it and emailed it.  about 30 hours later, I received a call from Samsung saying that the date the order was placed was missing.  The ship date was there but somehow the screen print didn't show the very top line.  So, I had to redo it.  I did a new screen print and resent it.  24 hours later, I got yet another phone call from Samsung saying they still had not received the information they needed.  I don't know who is monitoring their uploads but they need to pay better attention.  I made sure I sent enough copies of my receipt last night in both avenues so there would be no question.  I received another phone call this morning letting me know they were sending me a shipping label.  I was told to send my tablet and charging cord and to expect it to take 21 days to get it back.  21 DAYS??  I just feel like this has been a major, major hassle.  How come while I was on the phone with the first guy last week when I received the email asking or the invoice couldn't he have looked at the invoice and told me if there was a problem or not and sent a shipping label right then?  Why all the jerking around?"}

I turned the tablet over to someone that knew about tables and he told me that you need to be smarter than the equipment you are using.  He pull the junk micro memory card out of it and it started working like a charm.  I have since replaced the micro memory and can load as many mp4's that it will hold.  Very pleased with it's performance.  Worth the money. The following is my previous post. (I like the picture and the nice features loaded by Samsung but I don't like that I can't load and watch my videos that I watched on my 7 inch tablet.  Samsung makes it almost impossible to load and watch movies you already have as MP4's.  I am sure there is a business reason for this but I am looking for a work around to this problem.  Any ideas\")"}

I've had it for around two months and I've had no problems at all. I think I see why it's specs are worse to other tabs in the same price range now; the Galaxy Tab 4 8\" has better quality parts. It's screen doesn't have static ghost-touches, it's updates don't turn it into a slug, it has a microSD card slot, and the multi-tasking feature is a lot more useful than I thought it'd be.

I was impressed with the clarity of the movie,  the sound was pretty good and the size.  The price was about what he paid when I went to check it out on Amazon too.  So knowing that the OS was an Android system also AND Amazon sells this,  I bought it.  I do really like it but I'm an Amazon Prime member and I cannot watch any of the free streaming movies and tv shows that I have access to through my Prime membership.  This tablet WILL NOT acknowledge the streaming service through Amazon.  I was really disappointed with this tablet for that reason.  I'm going to keep this tablet but I'm going to buy the Kindle Fire HDX so I can get my prime movies and tv."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "It's a simple durable tablet. The screen resolution is weak, and the camera does not have a flash. It is a great starter tablet, or tablet for a child. For the price it is awesome. I sue this for work daily. If you want a basic no frills tablet, this is for you. If you want bells, and whistles; upgrade. If you want a something simple buy this tablet. If you are into electronics, you probably already know, this tablet is for beginners on a budget. If it fits your needs buy."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "I got this as an open box item from an amazon marketplace seller so I got a good deal at $165.\nIt's the perfect sized tablet for me (the 10\" is too big and hard to hold with one hand). Screen looks great! I already have a Galaxy S4, so I knew what to expect with this. I bought it so we could watch movies and play games while on the road, in the air or in our hotel or cruise cabin. It does have wifi so as long as you have access to wifi you can stream Netflix. If you don't have access to wifi, you can use your cell phone as a mobile hotspot and link them. Get a headphone jack splitter and you can share a movie. You can also plug in an external speaker for better sound if not wearing headphones. Terrific tablet for travel and you can add a sd card with up to 32 gb of space for movies and such. (I have heard you can put in a 64 gb sd card, but it's not listed in the product spec.)"}

Since I already have the kindle fire and the kindle reader- I opted for this one with a bigger screen.\nIt is light, very thin and has the same features as my Samsung Galaxy 5 phone except for the camera.  I brought it to a party with the expectations of getting great pictures but to my great disappointment my pictures were lousy and blurry.  The same shots taken on  my Samsung phone were bright and clear. I wonder why that is. My tab went into a 'sleep' mode and I could not ' wake 'it up.  So I had to reboot it.  Quite a few negatives for a brand new tab. On the plus side, I have a bigger, brighter movie screen with great sound on a much lighter tablet, that fits my phone prop on a landscape\nmode. Oh well !

She has never owned cell phone or really used a computer so I was thrilled that she is learning how to use this so quickly. She loves it Nd it helps pass the time during her 8+ hour chemotherapy treatments.\n It's a great size. Small enough to fit in her purse but big enough she can read the text and see the movies."}

Plus the Google store has tons of free apps you can down load. And the keyboard is the best because you don't have to switch back and forths for numbers.\nThe only down side, which is why I gave it the 4 star rating is that Adobe doesn't provide Flash player for Android anymore- they stopped a few yrs. ago.  What does that mean for you, you may think?  Any site that uses the Flash player for videos will not play. A lot of the little videos that ppl post on Facebook will not play.  In the Google app store, they do have browsers that say they can provide Flash player, but I haven't tried them.  So if you REALLY need to see those little videos then ya might consider Amazon's Kindle Fire or a Windows based tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "With electronics as well as other things in life, there will always be the argument that you get what you pay for.  This is true many times.  But it can also persuade the buyer to buy more than he or she actually NEEDS.  This is key.  The next Samsung up from here is the Tablet S.  I have no doubt of its quality.  But this one, at $160.00 less?  Its perfect for my needs.  There is this argument about resolution also.  1280 by 800 is more than sufficient for an 8 inch screen.  Technology is past what the human eye can actually see.  But its marketed in such a way that people go for it, and that is fine.  Let me repeat myself.  I do NOT think the next step from this is worth almost twice the price.  I bought this in white, its just right in the hand, its not that heavy.  Games seem to run very well, thought I have not loaded it up with graphic hungry games.  I like this size because it also mimics a phone with its portrait orientation.  Someone here complained about recharge time being ridiculously slow.  They are correct.  The solution is to power it down and then charge.  The speed difference is amazing.\n\nOverall - a GREAT value as I paid $189.99 for this.  I believe this is the size to go with if you want best balance between portability and usability.  I had an ASUS 10.1 model that gave out and I did not want another in that size.  I do not think this is cheap feeling at all either.  Yes, its plastic but it is textured in a way that gives it a nice feel in hand.  The camera is adequate but not great.  I did not buy this for that.  I have photo gear.  A single speaker is also in back so audio is decent but not anything to brag about.  But again - not an issue for me as I use ear buds for anything requiring great sound.\n\nRemember.... wants versus needs.  Figuring how this fits you can save you quite a bit of money.  If you want the best in this line, go with the Samsung S series tablet.  I simply cannot justify its price against this one.  This is my opinion only.  Buy this and I do not think you will be disappointed.  I think I may be a Samsung customer for life.  Excellent products!!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "We love this android device. Best out of the 5 we have tried. We have used Asus Transformer Prime (terrible), Nexus 7 (technically also Asus, and just OK), HTC One VX (great for a phone) and an older Samsung phone (S2, not so good). I love everything about the performance of this tablet. I have two issues that prevent me from going with 5 stars. First off, the volume buttons and the power button are right next to each other. Users are constantly turning off the system when trying to increase the volume. This is extra annoying as I have it password protected, so each time it happens the password needs to be entered again.\n\nIssue number two I am assuming is more an issue with the OS than this product. If I were reviewing the OS, I would give it 1 star for this issue. I bought the tablet for my almost 5 year old. I bought it because the OS supposedly supports kid mode. Here is a quote from the product description:\n\n\"Kids Mode Offers a Child-Friendly Interface\n\nCreate a separate profile for your kids and switch to Kids Mode--a child-friendly interface that is fun and easy to control. Parents can track the time their kids spend and even set preferences to manage which features their children can access.\"\n\nNo amount of fiddling around has allowed kid mode to work. Because online access is automatically restricted on the kids profile, it is impossible to run any game purchased through the Amazon App Store as well as almost every game purchased through the Play Store. All of the apps run fine on my profile. In the end we gave up on a kid profile and my 5 year old just uses mine. He constantly ends up on the internet through in game links and I find him often browsing the play store. All of the games he plays are purchased apps, nothing with ads in them. We have passwords on the Play Store and the App Store so he can't actually buy anything, but I don't like him on the internet at all.\n\nI don't like not having access to a promised feature simply because no one has bothered to make it work. I could accept not being able to run the Amazon store because it's technically side loaded, but the stuff purchased on the Play Store absolutely will not run other than some random fire truck game. Of course the system froze soon after I got that running, so maybe I shouldn't even count it. I couldn't really find any help on the internet and I tried everything I could think of, but nothing has worked so far. I did not call the company, so I have no idea if they would have been helpful or not. We are just living with it as it is for now.\n\nSo, other than the very disappointing issue with kid mode, this device is absolutely great. Fast, intuitive, beautiful, cheap, and compatible with almost all of our prior purchases. It was a great deal and I don't regret the purchase."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "I'm not going into detail here, there are other reviews here and even videos out there. Let me just tell you why I bought this. Well first off I got $200 from my rich Uncle for Christmas and said alright I'll just use this. Anyways, to get to the point, I've gone through 2 Droid phones already and I just wanted something bigger and prettier. This is great for any videos, games (android and emulators) and reading Comics/Manga and strategy guides. That's basically why I got it and I am very happy with it. The charge/battery life is decent and the features are easy to learn. If you ever have any questions just Google it. I also recommend that you buy an OtterBox Case for this. It's just obvious that this fragile beauty needs good protection. I expect many years of use out of this."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "After my ASUS tablet broke and absolutely nobody had the necessary equipment to fix it, I decided to go with a brand that's more recognizable as far as tablets go (meaning that if it breaks, I won't have to pay twice the price of the tablet to fix it via the official company). I chose a Samsung product partially because most of the shops in my area would be able to repair it but also because I've heard fairly good things about the brand itself.\n\nFirst off, the good. This is a relatively user friendly tablet and after some initial fumbling about I was able to locate everything that I needed and put it on the main screen so that I wouldn't have to worry about flipping through multiple gadgets that I'd only use once in a blue moon. This does run on Android and as such you'll have access to all of the Google Play goodies, which is helpful if you've already got an account through them for another device. I was pleased at how easy it was to upload everything onto the device and that you can pretty much do just about any of the basics with this tablet. (Videos, reading, etc.) People like me that are looking for someone to just do the stereotypical tablet use will greatly enjoy this tablet. I'm not fan of the more busy tablet games so I haven't checked those out just yet, although I do eventually plan to download one or two just so I'll have something for my nephews to play with on a long car trip later this year. It's also incredibly durable and I've dropped this at least once and it hasn't cracked, although this is in part to me putting this in an Otterbox case.\n\nNow the bad: the unfortunate thing with Samsungs is that they are extremely finicky with chargers and they really prefer that you use a Samsung cable. You can use other cables and it will charge, albeit extremely slowly to the point where it's not really worth it unless you have nothing else. I also noticed that this is pretty gung ho about you not wiggling the tablet around while it's charging. I tend to sometimes read or watch TV while it's charging and if I move it a little too much in one direction or another it will stop charging, despite the cord still being attached. I'm not sure if this is a factory issue or not, but it is slightly annoying. Other than that, occasionally the unit will occasionally freeze on me (although that's rare) and once in a while it'll have issues picking up specific wifi sources (although this has so far only been with a local college's wifi and may be them).\n\nBy large the flaws aren't so bad that I'd recommend getting something else, although they may be considered deal breakers for people who want a less temperamental tablet for extreme newbies. Other than that I'm fairly pleased with the tablet as a whole and the benefits (faster than my previous tablet, easier to get fixed) far outweigh the negatives. I'd probably say that this would be slightly better for intermediate users than beginners, though."}

(Much lighter than my Kindle Fire HD BUT I still love my Kindle!)\n3) 300.00 worth of free add ons. Thank you!\n4) Sleek\n5) GOOGLE PLAY!! ( As I've mentioned,  I love my Kindle but if I wanted to add an app from Google Play I either had to side load the app/enable the Unknown App Source. Quite frankly,  hated doing that and putting my sweet Kindle friend in danger.) NOW: NO WORRIES!\n6) Easy-Peasy!! I just got it yesterday and I haven't had much time to play and get familiar with it but it's very easy to figure out. Set up was a breeze.\n7) Battery life appears to be excellent.  So far. But, hey! There's an app for  that...on Google Play!\n8) I JUST DO!!!! I will always love my Kindle Fire HD 7\" and still use it often but when I was looking around for an upgrade, I decided that getting the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 was the best choice. It just made sense. Now I have the best of both worlds. While their both great, each does something a bit different from the other and THAT gives me more options.\n9) Front and rear camera which my Kindle lacked.\n10) Can be used as a universal remote!\n11) Adding a 64 GB memory card with microSD slot.\n12) I can use two apps at once!!\n\nI shall but love thee better everyday.\n\nDo I recommend that you get one of these bad boys?! Abso-positively!! The sooner the better. You won't be disappointed."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "Managed to snag this tablet (white) just before Xmas for $179. I had gift cards and points so this was a bargain and very little actual out of pocket, Xmas and b-day gift to myself all rolled into one nice brand spanking new package. I had been nerding out on the live floor displays at Staples and Sams Club for about 6 months with both the 7\"and the 8\" models. I ultimately decided on the 8\" tab since it had twice the onboard memory and twice the MicroSD capacity. I'm glad I did.\nI had previously had a Kindle Fire 1st gen and after really digging into it I ended up hating the OS, the fact that I couldn't get Google Play (all of my music, unless I tried to root it which I ultimately decided not to do- not worth it) and the measly 8g of memory (3 of which is taken up by system programs, leaving a paltry 5g for apps and storage).\n\nThis tablet is fantastic. Peppy, smooth graphics, excellent video playback. I can download whatever app I need since it has 16g onboard. Anything I need to store at any time with my 64g Microsd. The quad core is so much snappier than my 1st gen Kindle it was no contest.\nDownloading is smooth, Facebook and Twitter run like champs and syncing my Google accounts to all three of my devices, my PC, Samsung GalaxyS3 phone and now my Tab 8 is so easy with Smart Switch Moblie app. It easily wirelessly prints on my printer as well.\nSince Kindle app is a thing I can get my Kindle library and Samsung has tons of freebies as well with Play Books. Free storage with Dropbox too.\nBattery life is a not as good as on a Kindle Fire, but only slightly less so. Surfing and movies drain both quickly. Reading ebooks is better on the battery. But since I use my tablet more like a tablet than an e reader only, I'm not going to be as picky about that.\nPro tip: Turn off the GPS/location setting. Most people clearly don't do this enough and they're usually the ones complaining about battery life. GPS/location is great for...GPS navigation (duh) and if you have your local transit schedules synced and need to check the arrival/departure...other than that why do you need it? You really don't.\nAnother plus: This puppy is light. My Kindle Fire was much heavier and an inch shorter. I know a lot of people equate weightiness with quality, but with me performance=quality. I carry a lot of crap in my bag and the lighter the better. I've carried an ipad 2 for work and it feels like a brick in my bag compared to this Tab. I also like the 8\" version for ease of reading. I don't have to magnify the text with this size screen like I used to with my Kindle 7\".\nCamera quality could be better, especially the front facing camera. It's grainy and kinda slow but good enough for a Skype with my sister or mom. Transition between front and rear camera is smooth though so that's a plus. Just about a half second lag when it changes.\nCharging cord is a little too short, this is a big con. My power strip is right next to my bed (1 foot from the floor to the top of my mattress) and I can't charge while using the tab while I'm laying in bed. I have to use my phone's power cable if I want to watch a movie with a low battery. Also a con when you want to stream your Google Play music, Pandora or Spotify for a nice 10-12 hour work shift. If you don't have a nearby outlet or USB...be prepared to bring a longer cord or the battery is going to crap out on you for the last couple of hours if you're not fully charged when you start work.\nCharges fast. From a 10% battery to a complete charge in less than an hour.\n\nA few general remarks:\nUnless you by a \"Built\" brand neoprene case or search on Amazon for a custom snap in folding case...you're not going to find anything readily available for the 8\" Tab in store. Most stores stock 7\" and 10\" cases standardly. But 8\" cases are not the norm yet so there's that.\nIt's also not a commonly stocked screen protector size either.\nThe alarm widget works just like my phone. Loud and an array snooze options, location alarm and alarm sounds. I have to commend Samsung on this really. I have had numerous other cell and tablet manufacturers and Samsung alarms are by far the best. I get up at 4:30am every day for the past 14 years for my job and I've never been let down once by a Samsung alarm.\n\nLast of all, I usually get the white version. I have found that if you can get yourself to get used to it, you'll save yourself anywhere between $30 and sometimes $60 on Samsung products."}

I also own a Viewsonic G-Tab (old). I even tried several different I-pads from Apple.... I had a gift card from Best Buy and my local store has a 60% off open box sale, here was this brand new Samsung Tab 4 8inch I looked at it and the salesperson gave me the gist, I said I would think on it for a bit. Walking back to my car, all of a sudden there was this little voice in my ear!\n  Long story short, I bought it for 161 dollars including tax and with in minuets of getting it home I was receiving and sending emails! What a smooth operator this tablet is, right up there with the I-pads! No matter where you find this tablet it is a great one!\n  Over time we'll see how it does but the reviews here tell me that this tablet is a winner. poikaa"}

It is a bit wide (8\") if you're used to the 7\" tablet, but a great mini-tab. Screen resolution is GREAT, response is good, and the ability to expand storage is awesome. I would highly suggest getting a 32GB memory (microSD) as you will eventually need the additional memory. This makes the third samsung tablet in my household... all are very happy with it.\n\nIf you're wanting the top of the line, get the Tab S series... but for the money, you can't beat this one!"}

This one is just the right size for him to hold and carry around with him throughout the house.  He loves that he has his own tablet.  I used the multi-user features to set up a restricted account for him to use, and he can log himself on by clicking his profile picture with no problems.  I tried the kids mode app as well, and he does love the little games that come with it, as well as the interactive background, but its a little too restrictive since there;s no internet or youtube access allowed.  I'd rather be able to set parental restrictions within those apps instead of not being able to use them at all in kids mode.  That's why I went with restricted user access instead.  But that's not the tablets fault, so can't blame the Tab 4 for that."}

I took it back due to problems connecting it to the TV (which I found out later all of them can be connected to the TV wirelessly using a google Chrome stick).  So on Cyber Monday I went to AMAZON and saw some great prices.  WAY better than Best Buy.  I ended up getting a 8\" tablet and an awesome 360 degree rotating case for about $50 bucks cheaper.  I love it.  It's great for playing games, Facebook, surfing the web and the picture on it is amazing for movies/videos!  I do wish the sound on it was better quality (and louder) but if you put headphones in (to watch a movie) then it's fine.  It boots up fast for quick look-ups of recipes or to answer an email.  Over all I really like it and use it every night.  It's a good size for travel (not too big or too small) Thanks!!  :)"}

If you just need the basics in a tablet, this one is for you. If you want more advanced features like scrolling with your eyes, waving your phone awake, flipping pages with your head, etc., you need to buy one of the \"S\" Galaxy tablets. This tablet doesn't do any of that. It does have a smart screen feature where it turns off when you stop looking at it but it doesn't seem to work at all.\n\nI'm also used to the simplicity of the Apple operating system (aka iShackles), but this tablet definitely is more flexible and gets along well with other gadgets/operating systems. If you're struggling to work this thing, you can YouTube how to get it to do what you want or ask a tech geek. The Samsung counter at Best Buy is very helpful. You may want to ask them before you buy to make sure you're getting the one that fits your needs best."}

However, if your coming from an apple product (Ipad mini) this may leave you wanting more. First, the speaker isn't nearly as good as the ipad mini and is placed on the back which means the sounds gets muffled anytime you lay it down, the camera is also lacking (but who uses a tablet for a camera?). This tablet also weighs more than the ipad mini, and is slightly thicker. Now that the bad is out of the way, here is the good. This tablet can support external storage (something all apple portables lack). The shape of this product is longer than the ipad tablet, which for me, makes this easier to take notes on. The price is slightly less than the ipad mini. All in all, this tablet is a decent one, but after comparing constantly with my sons ipad Mini, I'm wondering if I've made a mistake."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "This is a review coming from a 27 year old who STILL does not own a smart phone, but is very much into browsing the internet, reading blogs, and online shopping. I liked the idea of owning a tablet and then I spilled wine on my laptop sending it to the repair shop for a minimum of 4 days (in actuality I still don't have it back and it's been 12 days) which I couldn't stand the thought of (a little sad, I know) so I decided I really should own another device for situations like this and also just for fun and convenience. I spent just a couple hours shopping around reading reviews and weighing pros and cons. My considerations were:\n\n- Android: I wanted this operating system to take advantage of the myriad Android apps. I was briefly tempted by the Kindle Fire but didn't like the idea of being limited to their proprietary browser. I need my Chrome.\n- Size: While tablets in the 10 inch range look nice and I'm sure I would enjoy one, they were out of my budget. At first I considered the 7 inch for affordability but for not much more an 8 inch really gives you much more screen. I read an article that said for web browsing at least 8 inches is ideal.\n- Portability: Not a priority for me initially but I have already started taking my tablet lots of places and it has not been inconvenient or felt too large. A 10.1 probably would be somewhat cumbersome in these situations.\n\nOnce I made those decisions it was pretty much a no-brainer that the highly rated Galaxy Tab 4 was a safe bet and it was also going for much lower than the list price on Amazon at the time, presumably because it was the Saturday before Black Friday and sales were already running.\n\nRight out of the box my Tab has worked perfectly, smoothly, and quickly. I love it. It's easy to get the hang of, even if you have very little experience with Android or smart phones in general like me. A breeze to search for and download all the apps your heart desires. I've got an app for almost all the major websites I frequent: Gmail, Facebook, Feedly, Pinterest, Keep, Wordpress, Etsy, Amazon, etc etc. I've also been playing a few games which work wonderfully.\n\nI purchased an Amazon Basics stylus and I LOVE it. Works just as it should, drastically reduces smudge marks on the screen, and makes lots of tasks easier. Get a stylus! And get this tablet!"}

But for navigating the screen they look virtually identical to me.  The other thing is the screen brightness on the Tab 4 works like it should but I have to manually set the Tab S screen or it will be too dim. I have read others with the same issue, not sure if there is a fix for this or not. Also the Tab S is supposed to be much faster but I sure can't see that at all, least not yet. The Tab 4 is very smooth and I can't tell it has a weaker processor than the S. The Tab 4 is for my girlfriend and so far the *only* issue she has had is that chrome can come up with a black screen sometimes but this is a known issue with Chrome. I don't have this issue with the Tab S, but I have had Chrome freeze at times so it is not perfect either.\n\nSo why didn't I just buy 2 Tab 4's?  The main reason is the S can have a physical hdmi connection and I wanted that. But both models have built in ways to do it wireless (screen mirroring) and both work just fine with my samsung smart tv.  To be fair, with Amazon promotions, I got the Tab 4 for a song so this is probably going to bias my review somewhat. But regardless, it is still much better tablet than these Cnet type reviews would have you to believe. So much, in fact, that I am considering exchanging the S for another 4 but still up in the air on this."}

The screen is super bright and the speaker is quite loud. The haptic buttons (back and multi-key) are not illuminated but they are marked on the frontso you can locate them.\n\nTablet is still loaded with tons of bloat ware but that's sadly considered normal. The tablet comes with a Samsung 1 amp (5 watt) charger. This is automatically made it lose a star! The battery is huge and the addition of the weak charger makes things rediculous. My s3 and s5 both came with 2 amp chargers, apple and aftermarket suppliers offer 2.2 amp chargers. Step it up, this thing takes all damn day to charge!\n\nI know Samsung likes to keep the front of the tablet clean looking, but putting the speaker on the back of devices is a poor move. Set it down to watch a video, you mute the volume. Put it face down on a hard surface and you can hear your music, but risk scratching the face. You can't win with a rear facing speaker.\n\nThe case is just a cheap slab of plastic under an enormous piece of glass framed in a thin strip of chrome. The device is clean with a discreet micro SD slot on the right side and power and volume buttons that blend right in."}

I have to turn it off constantly.\nI don't like having the Samsung website defaulting as my home page when I select the internet. I always have to go into my bookmarks and select Google or whatever search engine I want to use.\nOther than that, I love the fact that I can add up to 64gb of memory. I use it as a music player and connect to my home stereo via bluetooth and can play my whole music library from my tablet.\nI think that I would also suggest the next largest size. this 8\" is still a little bit small to read from and surf the web."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "This is my review of the Galaxy Tab 4 8.0:\n\nFirst I didn't buy this product on Amazon, I bought it on sale at Best Buy So I cant be much help with the buying experience.\n\nBuild Quality:  Samsung typically has always been criticized for their design and material choices.  To be honest if your one of the people that is critical of them for either, this product will most likely do little to change your opinion.  However in my opinion the build quality is pretty good, it has a hard polycarbonite casing with an aluminum ring around the screen.  The buttons are the same color and material as the rest of the tablet, they have a very tactile and responsive feel to them.  Its a very solid but lightweight tablet.\n\nScreen:  The main essential of any tablet is the screen because this is what you most interact with.  Lets be honest here no matter what your opinion is of Samsung...they are the best screen makers in the business there is reason why Apple always goes back to them for their devices.  The screen on the Tab 4 continues to show why Samsung is the best screen maker, its very bright and its extremely responsive.  The only real complaint that I have is that small text are extremely hard to read and you will have to zoom in to read them, so book reading can be an adventure so I would suggest using a larger font.  The viewing angles are really good as well but I don't know how much the average person will really care about that.\n\nBattery:  My biggest problem with this tablet isn't the battery but how long it takes the battery to charge, my goodness I would leave home for work at 0800 and come back at lunch around 1130 and it would only be at 65% charged. But on the plus side the standby time is very good,  it only lose maybe 5% over night.  A fully charged battery last roughly charged battery will get you through an entire day of surfing the web, checking email and doing work.\n\nUI/Productivity.  I know another one of the biggest complaints with Samsung is the Touchwiz interface.  I honestly don't have an issue with touchwiz.  I have haven't noticed a single incident of lag.  However if you're really that turned off by touchwiz  you can opt for the Google launcher (which comes with the tab out fo the box, but can also be downloaded from the play store) to give your tab the stock andriod experiece although a lot of elements of touchwiz will remain.  Thankfully the annoying water drop sounds can be turned off as well.  My favorite part of this tablet is the split screen function, there is nothing more handy on a tablet.  Being able to write a paper while have your reference material on the same screen is awesome.  If you own a galaxy S4/S5 or a Galaxy Note 3 the SideSync is a pretty handy trick as well.  This allows you to see and control all elements of your phone on the screen of your tablet this includes playing games that are on your phone to replying to text messages, the only thing I couldn't get it to recieve phone calls although I could see it ringing.\n\nO/S:  KitKat 4.4 is really good.  For those of you who remember the early days of Honeycomb and Jellybean will remember when there was hardly any apps or if there were, they would always be much better on the iPad but times have definitely changed there is 1000s and 1000s of tablet optimized apps for android now.  There is still more on the iPad but you will find plenty on Android as well.  Android still has a long way to go but they have made inprovemnts in leaps and bounds.  This operating system is incredibly smooth, gone are the days of android lag.  And its very attractive as well with its larger icons and cool transition affects.\n\nMisc: Camera 3MP and pointless unless  your in a real crunch, S Voice:  also pointless and definitely subpar compared to Google Now, Memory 16 gig but expandable to 128 Gigs...fantastic, packaging and presentation...Meh!!!\n\nOverall this is a fantastic tablet at a great price.  If you can't afford one of the expensive tablets like the Tab S or the iPad then this a very good alternative.  I currently own this tablet, a Tab S 10.1, a surface RT 2, and a iPad Air, and I use this one the most by far for everything from just laying in bed reading or finishing up or editing spread sheets on the run at work.  If you are on the fence about this tablet, give it a shot, its well worth it."}

If I did it all over, I probably would have bought the Tab 3 which looks better and has some features (such as MHL) that this one does not have. Also, if you're a fan of the menu button which is going the way of the dodo on android devices, know this does not have one. It also lacks the home row of apps on the home screens. Otherwise, a solid tablet; I like it very much."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "Cons:\nSince this was my first tablet, I was thinking it would be more like a PC and I found the interface very unintuitive.  I also expected there there would be tutorial movies that I could view pre-installed on the tablet or online but there were none.  Also I don't like the call in first and get a code number, start the help app, type in the code, and then get live online support on the tablet.  Why can the app just connect and I give then any extra info then?  The User Manual, also not on the tablet, did not talk about how to use the tablet or how to use the Apps on the tablet.  So its all trial and error.  On top of that the battery is at 50% with in two hours if the WIFI is turned on.\nPros:\nThe screen to great, the price competitive, and it should do what I want (download schedules at conventions, etc. and read books downloaded).  I wish they could be used more like phones to I could use it in the car for navigation but the WIFI doesn't work that way it seems.  Is a good piece of hardware but the support needs lots of improvement."}

I am typing this using the voice to text  I'm pretty impressed I have not had to correct any of the spelling at this point although I will show you this if I miss type something like I miss typing typing delete delete delete delete last word back back  (see all of that I was trying to delete the last word) for some reason this is not recognize that so I would have to go back and delete. all of that has to be fixed by clicking on the keyboard and fixing it. also punctuation is very difficult if I have to say, it doesn't fine it puts a,,,, and that's just fine but when you say.. For example it takes a longer time to put a period at the end of the sentence then it did to you say, at the end of a sentence as you can tell from from this reviewyou can see some typos typos and I am NOT going to correct any of the mess ups."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "The device comes in typical Samsung packaging - well packaged. It also comes with the essential charging devices, warranty information, user manual, and extras. Please note that my review is based on device with modifications and without.\n\nWithout modification the device can be a little bit sluggish, but thats only due to some bloatware and the Samsung UI overlay on android. A simple fix for this would be to disable all apps that you will not use (does not require root for 90% of these apps) and then to install a UI replacement such as Nova Launcher. Once Nova launcher installed go through the advanced settings of Nova and turn off all animations on desktop, draw, and application switching. Set these to \"Faster than Light\" and all lag perceived will be eliminated.\n\nWith modification: Using any root method and putting root on the device (some can do so without tripping knox) will help with app removal / freezing significantly. To find a safe and knox-problem-free root method go to - http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2785869 -\nThis method has not tripped knox for me and has allowed me to remove all the bloatware I've since discovered. I've freed up 1.2 gigs of internal memory and thus reboot / application open times have hastened by at least 30%!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "I have a Google Nexus 7, the 2013 model with the fancy 1920 x 1200 display with 323 pixels per inch. While it works great for book reading and other apps that have adjustable fonts, many apps don't let you adjust the display size. The higher resolution can result in tiny displays with control buttons are too small to be selected with a fingertip, and the text that needs magnification.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab 8 has a little bigger screen, and old-fashioned 1280 x 800 resolution for 189 pixels per inch. I've now been able to compare the Nexus side by side to the Tab 8 and I've found the following:\n\nSome text based apps have adjustable font sizes.  With these apps, the bigger 8 inch screen gives you a couple of extra words per line, but doesn't otherwise make a major difference in usability.\n\nSome apps are pixel dependent, meaning a given element is so many pixels wide. On screens with higher resolution, these elements are smaller because the pixels are closer together. I have a note taking app that worked great with an old tablet with a 1024 x 768 display. I had to quit using it when I got the Nexus, because the font was too tiny. I needed reading glasses to use this app on the Nexus. But it works fine on the Tab 8 and it's again easy to read.\n\nSome apps have a fixed size font, regardless of screen resolution. I have a HTML editor that was originally designed for PCs (it has the Windows 98 style File, Edit and Format drop down menus across the top). On the Nexus, the buttons and menus were too small to use with my fingertip. With the bigger screen of the Tab 8, the controls are much more usable. But while the buttons are larger on a lower resolution screen, for some reason, the actual text font is the same size on both tablets. But the text is actually more readable on the Tab 8. The Samsung screen had a bright white background and dark black text. The Nexus screen had a light grey background, and dark grey letters.  In spite of the greater resolution of the Nexus, I find the Samsung is easier to read.\n\nI mostly use my tablet for writing. Overall, the Nexus feels like a big smart phone. The Samsung feels like it's approaching a laptop screen. It's only slightly larger than the Nexus 7 in your hand, but is a better tool for writing and office work. For multimedia, the Nexus would probably be a better choice."}

I have seen reviews saying there is no difference from the tab 7 and 8, so if you find the tab 7 at a cheaper price, I would suggest going with that one.

The only  problem was  a new buyer  is suppose  to get 50gb  of  Drop-box  cloud  storage  when signing  up  for which  I  did not receive .  This wasn't  a  major issue  for me, not getting the cloud storage.  I bought  this tablet to  replace  a  old Kindle  which is now obsolete.  I  would recommend  this tablet over a Kindle  any day of the  week due to the Android Play Store .  I found this tablet easy to learn  when it comes to the settings.  Connecting to a WIFI  connection  was not a problem.  The one  thing  about this  tablet is that when you first get it,  you should turn the unit  off after the set up  process  and then  charge the battery completely  to 100 percent. It takes  about  five to  six  hours  to  go from a  fifty  percent charge  to  a  completely charged  battery. If  you have a  Samsung  Smart Phone then using  this tablet  should be super easy to use."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "Absolutely perfect purchase...\n  As a Galaxy S3, S4, Note 2, S5, and now Note 3 user for quite a few years, this was a no brainer for myself. However, this purchase was a gift for my wife (who btw has been an avid Kindle user/supporter for years, and swore she would never walk away from Kindle.)\n  While comparing and trying to convince her to let me buy her the Galaxy Tab over the Kindle, she fussed and argued that all she wanted was the newer Kindle Fire HD, she complained that she would \"not like the Galaxy, she knows what she likes\" etc. etc. Well, after a few days of discussion, and persuasion, I convinced her to TRY the Galaxy Tab 4 8.0 and if she didn't like it we would simply exchange it.\n  Not 2 hours after receiving it, her mind was blown away. She continuously thanks me for it, and the best part, she admitted that I was right!!  (that's a first) LoL. She was shocked to see that I could easily download all of her previous Kindle purchases from Amazon through their app, she loves the Google Play Store, she loves the customizable features, including setting up different users so that when our son decides to pick it up and play, it's customized towards him. All in all, she just loves the freedom of choices this tablet gives her compared to the Kindle.\n  From both of our mouths, and our 6 year old son, this truly is an amazing tablet. The quality, speed, and overall swiftness of the this tablet is amazing. And I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone out there shopping around, or comparing different tablets.\n  Thank you Amazon for yet another speedy delivery of a perfect purchase. I hope this review will help someone in a similar situation that we were in."}

Based on our daughter's experience (she's a college senior) there is no way he's going to carry that laptop to classes plus books and notebooks, etc. So we went looking for a tablet, and this 8-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 is wonderful. The resolution is very good and the clarity and focusing of the camera and video is amazing.  The free Polaris Office programs have him set up for note-taking, and of course that's barely the surface of the apps he has available. The Multi-Window ability is just what his multi-tasking heart desires. You can read downloads from Amazon Kindle, Google Play Books and Google Play Newsstand.\n\nIn particular, we are happy with the 8-inch size. It's not \"that much\" bigger than a 7-inch, but that extra inch makes a nice difference for reading documents, viewing movies, etc. The 10-inch tablets are nice, but more than he needs for mobile purposes (and he will still have his regular laptop back in his room).\n\nWe also snapped up a ZAGG folio for the tablet that is fantastic. This is a hard protective case. It has backlit keys on a hinged keyboard base - you snap in the tablet and wow, the keyboard is there like a mini-laptop. It has 135 of viewing angles, that is, like a regular laptop, you can position the screen through a 135 range.\n\nEverybody's happy!\n\nHappy Reader"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "Samsung has so many tablets out right now, that it was really hard to decide which one to get.  I ended up choosing the 8\" galaxy tab 4 instead of the Galaxy tab S primarily because of the price difference - I just didn't want to pay that much of a premium for the super amoled screen that the Galaxy tab s has.  I decided to skip the slightly larger more powerful galaxy tab pro, because this one actually has a longer battery life - and that was very important to me.  I'm glad I chose this model, because out of all of the galaxy tabs, I really think this provides the most bang for your buck.  The tablet feels plenty fast and responsive, so I'm not sure the speed improvement of the S and Pro models would be that noticeable.  Holding it in your hand, it doesn't really look much larger than my older galaxy tab 2 7\", but you definitely do get more screen real estate.  The display is also very nice and crisp.  Out of all the tablets out there right now, I think this is hits the sweet spot of screen size, price and performance. Highly recommend."}

I had a tab 2 10 inch but wanted something smaller to put in my purse. I was going to purchase the 7 inch but I am happy I didn't.\nMy mother has the 7 inch so when I used hers the internet page doesn't fit on the screen so you need to move it around, but on the 8inch in fits perfectly.\nI love how it has a dual screen. It is light weight and have not had any issues with it. I don't know much about computers or tablets but compared to my 10 inch I love this."}

There's plenty of articles out there on the specs so I'll skip the boredom.\n\nInstead, what I can say is I love the physical size of this. The screen is bright and easy on the eyes. It's easy to hold and very light.  This tablet is more long shaped that wide (slightly different than the iPad Mini screen size) so watching movies fill the screen. The standard USB port makes one less cable to carry, but will admit I do like the iPad's lightning cable better.\n\nOne thing to be aware, is that Samsung has loaded this tablet with a bunch software that you cannot uninstall or removed."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "I bought this tablet to downsize from a Galaxy Note 10. I primarily use my tablet as an e-reader and a way to check email and social media and I wanted a tablet I could toss in my purse. I thought the 8 inch would be a nice compromise between the 10\" and the smaller 7\". It does fairly well for the purposes I bought it. I haven't had any performance issues. The screen resolution is great - pictures are clear and vivid and print is crisp. The screen is not quite big enough to view PDF's easily. If you view a lot of PDF documents I would recommend buying a 10\" tablet. My biggest problem is a feature most people probably like - the extra slim bezel around the screen. It is not big enough for me to hold without touching the screen (and I have small hands). Most of the time this is not a huge issue. When using it as an e-reader it becomes a major problem. When I accidentally touch the screen pages turn. When I hold it at the bottom I hit the back button and close the book all together. I keep experimenting with ways to hold the tablet without this happening but have had little luck so far. I am sure this probably would not be as big a problem for many people. All in all it is a good 8\" tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "Since I have owned tablets from the Samsung Tab line since the Tab 2, I can still say that in my opinion that Samsung makes a excellent and wonderful tablet with this Tab 4 Eight! It arrived with  Kit Kat onboard, however as on now (September, 2015), it updated to Lollipop 5.1.1. If you are looking a high quality eight inch tablet, this may very well be the one for you! For me I found that this tablet has that WOW, WOW, WOW Factor. So below, I am listing the many Pros I personally have found while using this tablet:\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Overall Speed And Performance and Android Kit Kat OS:\nWith the fast 1.2  GHz Quad processor,  Since I owned the Samsung Tab 3 8.0 before, I have noticed faster loading, this tablet runs ultra smooth and very, very responsive!  Love that this tablet has 16GB Internal memory.\nIf you have used a Samsung Galaxy device as S3, S4, S5, Note 3, or other Galaxy type, you will love the OS and the familiar Samsung Touch Wiz interface on this tablet. However, what if you have never used Android OS or even a Samsung device? No worries, as this tablet is easy to learn in my opinion.\n\n+ SCREEN SIZE IS JUST RIGHT SIZE - VERY CLEAR/SHARP SCREEN FOR READING eBooks or VIEWING WEBPAGES. (Screen in my opinion is large and has superb clarity/clearness for reading eBooks and webpages as the print is so readable as I find it VERY CLEAR/VIVID. This is a great in-between size tablet to use. And I found that the screen was large enough to read webpages easily or watch videos. The screen has a PPI (pixels per inch) of 189, which renders a crisp and clear screen and I found that the colors are super vivid and very colorful.\nPortability - Excellent as I use a combo MoKo stand-cover-case on it and it is easy to place into my purse or any bag as it is so easy to carry anywhere!\n\n+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - It is said that you can add a 64gb SD card for personal files. In my case, I have a 64GB SD card and still have plenty of room after my songs, files and photos are added.\n*** Also, I inserted an 128gig SD card and the tablet read it just fine. I am planning on purchasing an 256GB card and try it in this tablet also.\n\n+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi - Setting up WiFi and keeping a great signal and long distance WiFi strong signal is one superb feature on this tablet. So I compared the signal strength with the Tab 4 vs my regular Android phone. The Tab 4 had about 35% stronger signal then the phone. I believe it is because there is a very strong WiFi receiver in this tablet. At home or on the road, I am able to connect to many free WiFi hotspots very easily with great signal strength.\n****Do you need to know how to get on the internet when you are out of a WiFi range? Ask me about this as I have written an article on how to do this using a MiFi type of service from different service providers (please ask in the comment section for more info).\n\n+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: This comes with a OK app for reading Office documents, however, I prefer Kingsoft Office which is a free app from Playstore. It is the best I have ever tried and I am very picky about so called Office programs. It is very compatible with MS Office as it reads, edits and creates Office files and reads PDF files, and it has more features of any other Android Office program that I tried. This app is a MUST have for tablet owners in my opinion.\n\n+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player, this is a free App from Playstore and it plays every home video I tried). Also MX Video Player is very good, however, I prefer QQ Player.\n\n+ Music Player/Sound Quality - Stock player has clear sound through the outside \"speakers\" are really OK. Better with good quality headphones or a BlueTooth Speaker. To sync easily with Windows Media Player may I suggest the Playstore app free called WinAmp for the tablet as it is very highly rated and the sound is SUPERB!\n\n+ Battery Life- For me, I noticed that this model the Tab 4, has better battery life than my older Tab 3 eight! Excellent, so far, however, this is what I have found: When I am on WiFi, I go to the websites I need and then as soon as I am done (reasonable time), I exit the browser (or YouTube, etc) and TURN OFF WiFi. However, I run my brightness at 100%. So this seems to keep the battery going longer.\n\n+ Kindle App - I installed the Kindle App and synced my Kindle books. Began to read a new book and was very impressed with how exceptional the book rendered using this Tab 4 8.0. Very impressed as the text was very crisp and clear.\n\n+ OTG USB Compatible - You can add an optional OTG (On the Go Micro USB adapter cable to the Micro port for copying files to your flash drive and from your flash drive to the Tab 4). I already had one from my Samsung phone and it works great on the Tab. You can also plug in a mouse, I tried it and it worked. *Note that portable external hard drives and portable DVD/CD drives will not work using OTG in the Tab 4 as I discovered when I tried to read my hard disks via OTG in the Tab 4. However, it is still good to know that you can easily plug in your flash drive and copy files to the Tab 4 and from Tab 3 to PC--what a time-saver.\n\n+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices as well as Bluetooth keyboards, Bluetooth Stereo Headsets, Bluetooth speakers (all I tried) and copied files at a great rate of speed. SUPERB and FAST Bluetooth.\n\n+ Screenshots: There is no ICON for screenshots, however, to take a quick screenshot, hold down home button and power button (at the same time), and then it will take a beautiful screenshot. You can find your screenshot in MyFiles, Internal Storage, Pictures, and Screenshots. I use this sometimes for a map on the internet it saves time and this way it is SAVED for later viewing when I am offline.\n\n+ MICRO USB PORT - No more having to use the old type of (non standard) USB charger/cable that the Tab 2 line had. However, this tablet requires a 2 AMP USB Charger to charge the tablet so it will not charge on a standard 1 AMP (phone charger) as I tried and only the 2 AMP one will work. This tablet uses the same Micro 2 AMP type of chargers that the Galaxy Note 8 uses.\n\nCONS:\n-  Camera - The 3MP rear camera on this Tab 4 8.0 and it not as good of a camera as the older Tab 3 line. Also, there is no flash on the camera, yet there are several helpful modes (7 modes) to enhance your shots. For me, I use Auto mode. And I tried the camera and video and was happily surprised in the quality (that is for outdoor shots) - it is pretty good. However, I will continue to use my regular camera for serious picture taking and videos.\n***Note when I take INSIDE pictures, I use the NIGHT MODE on the camera as I found that my pictures with this mode take are taken inside or in a dimly lit area come out BETTER and CLEARER, better detailing.\nWhen I am outside, I use either the AUTO mode (takes pretty good pictures) or I use the Panorama mode.\nWhen I want 9 seconds of SOUND included in my picture say at a special event, I use the Shot and Sound Mode. The sound comes out nice and it plays when you open the picture on the tablet.\n\n-  New Adobe Flash is not supported, however, I found that archived flash is rather old and not really suited for playback on ANY Android after OS 4.1. I did get a couple of videos to work in the Photon Flash Player and Browser however (sometimes).\n\n* Bottom line/My Suggestions to You: Would I buy this WiFi only model over again? Yes because this Tab 4 8.0 is lightweight, easy to hold in ONE HAND, and it just as easy to hold as the Tab 4 7 inch, yet has so much more screen real-estate than the Tab 4 7 inch and clarity etc, for just a few dollars more, this is a MUCH BETTER BUY! And I have found because the screen is so crisp and clear, it reads internet pages CLEARER, Home Videos are larger and much clearer to see etc. And the 8 inch is so easy to pop into a briefcase, bag or purse etc than say a large 10 inch is...if you travel and want to go light, may I suggest this Tab 4 8.0 to you!\n-\nSince I am somewhat of a techie person, I will be glad to answer any questions that you may have. Just ask in the comment section and I will answer promptly."}

I can wirelessly transfer files back and forth from my computer, phone, etc.  I can display photos on my television without a cable as well.  The 8 inch size is perfect and the resolution is comparable with 7 and 8 inch screens, at least by my eyes.  Photos and other graphics \"snap\" beautifully.\n\nI've read negatives on the camera and I agree it's not the best.  It's fine for quick snapshots but I will stick to my DSLR if I want quality shots."}

This tablet is no different. Bluetooth communications are solid, the graphics are very good, the battery lasts all day so long as I am not playing graphic intensive games or turning off the power saving mode. I use mine to read PDF books, listen to music, watch videos (which chews up more power than reading a book), and browsing the internet whenever I don't have access to a PC. I highly recommend getting the SQUARE TRADE Protection Plan for all your electronics, especially this one. Be sure to keep your receipt available and get a good case (paid $15 for one from Pellem here on Amazon and the tablet actually knows its covered by it. Great product, highly recommended. Note: If you're going to buy a microSD card for storage, but a high speed one because this tablet can take advantage of it. I used a SanDisk 64gb that's a class 10. They're about $45 or so now."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "I originally bought a Dell Venue 8 but wasn't happy with slow 54MBps WiFi it had so I returned it and bought the Galaxy Tab 4 8.0 model.  So far, this tablet has satisfied my needs.\n\nThe WiFi runs at 150MBps, which is respectable since I bought it to primarily stream videos from my computer and watch Cable TV while working out in my garage while on the treadmill.\n\nOne initial problem I had was trying to access the menu in some apps.  Properly coded apps are suppose to have the menu button (three dots/lines) in the corner of the app's main screen.  However, one of my messaging apps didn't have that.. and Samsung replaced the menu (navigation) key with Recent Apps.  After further research I discovered that the Menu button was still there... just hidden.  To access it, all you do is Long Press the Recent Apps button while inside an app and it will bring it back up.  I was so relieved to find that.\n\nThe screen is very bright and the touch controls aren't too bad.  The sound...  well, the tiny mono speaker in the back isn't all that great.  However, I have a bluetooth speaker that I use... so audio is never a problem for me.\n\nMany people prefer stock Android over Samsung's TouchWiz interface.  I actually don't really mind it at all... and find stock to be kind of boring and too plain.  It does take time to learn all the menus... but that isn't too hard.. and there are a lot of features not available in standard android... like setting up part of the screen that doesn't detect touch and screen color/audio calibrations.\n\nAs far as performance goes..  it runs OK...  I do get lag when playing Plants vs Zombies 2.  Multiwindow is ok, but I don't use it since it doesn't work with many apps you install.... just the preinstalled stuff, primarily.\n\nConcerning Bloatware...  this tablet does come with a few apps you may never use.  Some of them can be disabled from the Settings/Application menu.  However, there are a few that can't.. and they will run continuously.  If you are looking to root this tablet...  that ability just surfaced and it is now possible to do that.  If you do that, you can then install an \"app manager\" that will Freeze those apps you don't want running as well as prevent automatic startup of apps you don't need running all the time.\n\nAs far as MicroSD cards.  There is a slot that allows them.  Right before I bought this tablet, I picked up a Samsung EVO 32GB card and it worked perfectly.  However, with Android 4.4, Google no longer allowed apps you installed yourself to write to SD Cards you install.  Because of that change, I  couldn't wireless copy over files onto the card... I had to use the internal memory to save them... or connect the tablet to a computer and copy paste onto the card directly.  However, if you root the device you could install an app that allows you to write to the card again.\n\nThis device is lightweight but I highly recommend you order a case for it, as well as a Screen Protector...  because the display is a huge smear magnet..."}

It was so easy for me to pick up and start using right away, and was instantly familiarlike a big smartphone. It's quick, convenient, and has a good amount of storage space. I got the case for it to protect myself from dropping it since I take it everywhere with me now. I highly recommend. No issues at all so far. I also find the battery life to be impressiveabout 8 hours of solid use before I need to charge it, or much longer if you're not running anything and it's asleep."}

But my father inlaw wanted a tablet with lots of storage so he can save family pictures in it. The tablet was at a affordable price he did not want a windows or apple tablet so i got him this instead. It is very easy to use and it very fast for regular usages. It fits in his hands it does not feel too big or to small since he has big chubby hands. The fonts can be easily read since he is old and wears glasses. The shipment came very fast and well packaged."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "There is really nothing I do not like about this product. As of late, I am extremely impressed with Samsung products. This tablet is perfect for me. It isn't too big or too small. It fits in my small to medium sized purse and goes just about everywhere with me. My significant other has the older version, which is very similar. I fell in love with his and wanted to get my own, and accidentally bought this one instead - it looks almost exactly the same as the older version. I read that the camera on the Tab 4 is not as good as the older version, but that's okay with me. I have yet to take a picture with it (that's what my Samsung Galaxy S4 is for :). My favorite thing about this product is how well it works with Google apps. I frequently use Drive, so being able to access word documents on my tablet is a huge life saver. I do a lot of my homework on it, but I wouldn't recommend it for typing assignments, although you could get a keyboard for it. Watching videos on it is great, too. Seriously, buy this product and you won't regret it!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "After reading all the reviews, I ordered the Galaxy Tab 4, 8 inch and a SD card. I am very pleased with the performance and all of the apps and features that came with it. The Google play store goes on and on and you can find anything there.  I am still downloading new apps daily, while deleting the ones that I am not happy with. I have synchronized all my email/calendar accounts, sent photos and other things from laptop to the tablet, and found some apps for all kinds of stuff I didn't even know I wanted...all saved to the SD card so I can leave the main storage free to update the apps that came with the tablet. This tablet sure has a lot of things all packed in it and arranged so I can find when I want. And.....it seems to know when I mess up and asks what do I want to do. I am surprised the battery lasts so long. I did download from the Samsung site the operation manual and saved to the SD card and can pull it up when I want to check on something. The operation is so easy, I really have not had to do a lot of reading of the manual. I found a free app for wifi phone that I can use in a fix. That was the most difficult thing so far in following Google's instructions to set up a free account but it works fine. I use the speaker instead of ear buds. Good quality, for calling through the internet. The keyboard is pretty good although I did order and install a combo bluetooth keyboard/case which is removable. If the keyboard gets in the way, I can just take it off.  I did this so if on a trip, I have more options when doing a lot of email or notes. So far, can't say anything negative."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "I LOVE Amazon and was very disappointed that the features listed for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 that I purchased were not accurate (keep reading...it's all good now!). After several days of shopping for tablets I decided on this one for size, cost, quality and also largely because of the ability to utilize the Kids Zone. I am sharing this tablet with my daughter and liked the ability to limit her time on it as well as to limit the content for her. I was unable to find anything on the tablet that said Kids Zone, and searching the Samsung site didn't bring up info on Kids Zone for this tablet. I finally did a live chat with a Samsung rep and found out that, in fact, this tablet does NOT have Kids Zone. HOWEVER, I was just prompted to do a software update and was thrilled to see that Kids Zone was on the update!\n\nI thought I would be fine with a smaller tablet but wasn't sure so I was glad this was an extra inch over the smaller 7\" tablets. I like the smaller size for portability, especially since I'm sharing it with my daughter.\n\nI'm still setting up the tablet and have a lot to learn. I think I will really like the tablet overall. The screen is really clear,I have had good luck with Droid apps in the past when I had a Droid phone, and it will serve the purpose for which I bought it. It's too early for me to say much more but I think this is a great buy!"}

Although, I think the Tab 4 would be easy to use regardless of prior Android experience.  Eight inch screen is a perfect size for my needs.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "I bought this Galaxy Tab 4 after owning iPads, iPod Touch and iPhones over the last 4 years. I wanted something that was less Appleish and more functional. The Galaxy Tab 3 that I played with at the local stores had the multiple windows, plenty of apps and functioned well. The Tab 4 is faster, a little more sleek and a few tweaks to the processor speed. I pre-ordered and had it at my door May 1.\n\nThe things I really like:\n* The 8 inch screen is perfect for reading, yet compact enough to make it convenient to carry. If you have smaller hands, you may want to consider the 7 inch screen.\n* The quality is excellent with fit and finish to rival any tablet in its class.\n* The Android platform works smoothly and doesn't hang up as often as either the Apple iOS  6 or iOS 7 operating systems. No clunky screens, delays responding or freezes that I found common on the iPad Retina.\n* Plenty of Apps. I'm sure you could find more for Apple, but I doubt you will miss them. Every App I had loaded on my iPad was available in the Play Store.\n* Multi-window is great. Drag and drop from one to another is a useful tool.\n* Smart Stay works well. It monitors your eyes and won't go into sleep mode if you are watching. Look away, and it goes to sleep. Cool trick. And you can turn it off.\n* Easy setup: It only took a few minutes after the initial charge to go completely through the setup.\n* Easy navigation: Once you play around with the screens and buttons, it is very intuitive.\n* Great battery life. I am probably on it 4 hours a day. I charge it after about 8 hours.\n* Expandable memory. All my music is going on an SD card. No running out of memory like on the iPad, iPod or iPhone.\n* Screen is crystal clear. There are better ones out there, but you won't miss them.\n\nAlmost forgot. The built in IR is great, especially if you have Samsung TV, Blue ray,  Sound, like I do. Very easy to control everything in my living room from my Tab.\n\nThings I didn't like - (very minor):\n* Cameras could be better. Quality is limited to 3 mp.\n* I can't find a detailed user's manual. Not a big issue.\n* No cases available as of today. I'm sure this will change soon.\nTIP: If you like taking screenshots, instead of pushing buttons, you just swipe across the screen with the side of your hand. It will store the pic in your My Files folder."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4V2", "review": "This is my first tablet and I must say its pretty good. I chose 8\" white over the 10.1 mainly for the feel and the size. I ordered with prime and it came within 2 days. I like the ability to use multi window with a limited number of apps available. The only thing I didn't like was registering this product for the perks through Samsung. I have still not be able to receive any and process can be a little confusing. I don't know why I haven't received my codes yet.  Anyway, I like this tablet and would recommend it.\n\nUpdate:\n\nDecent tablet for the price but I would give it lower stars due to poor customer service. I have still not received my perks! I am constantly told to check my spam folder but I haven't received anything except a 50% code for Samsung accessories on their site. I have called,emailed, chatted and face booked all with no avail for these dumb codes for a 10 dollar google play credit.  It's not with my time or perhaps yours to even try for it. I'll update if I get the codes.\n\nonly other complaint is that it takes forever to charge up.\n\nBattery life is average to a little low if you don't use your tablet a lot.\nCamera is OK but could be better.\n\nask any questions you like about it"}
