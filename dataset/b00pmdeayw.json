Powerful processors, nice screen, easy to use Android and most important the advanced operating system and I can customize the tablet very easily. I can work and study whenever and wherever I am with this tablet. There is no lag here because of the powerful processors and the screen has very high resolution. The color performance is perfect, compared to my ipad. This is more portable to my ipad so I would prefer this tablet carrying out with me. Overall great, 5 stars!"}

However, we quickly learned that the system couldn't keep up with most activities. Many games, when opened, cause the OS to crash and results in a system restart. Games seem to lag when playing. Internet searches, even with a good wifi signal, are very slow. The charging port seems to be too big and causes the cord to move, which interrupts the charging and causes the cord to fall out of the port.  I cannot recommend this tablet for any purpose."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "To begin with, the screen on this is very cheap. If the device is not held perfectly perpendicular to the users face, the color begins to distort and make reading impossible, much like very old flat screen TVs. The screen is also highly reflective and if I am viewing a dark-background app I can see more of my face reflecting on the screen than the actual app. Finally, the screen recognition is fine for tapping, but when I need to slide across something it causes all sorts of problems. I have to attempt to slide 3-4 times because the slide will not activate, then it usually taps something it shouldn't have.\n\nWhen I synced my calendar to the device, every single event had the wrong time. I went into the calendar and changed my timezone to get the correct time and now the time on the homepage of my device is wrong. I haven't found a way to get both times correct. The calendar app is also  hard to read because it only shows 8 hours of the day at a time. Thus I have to scroll through the day to view my events and we've already been over the difficulty in scrolling.\n\nThe construction is very cheap plastic. It is lightweight to the point I am afraid it will simply snap in half. I have serious concerns that the screen will not withstand any use (I hate screen protectors, never use them) I charged the battery to 100% last night, left the device idle, and this morning at 11 am the battery is 17%.\n\nAt this point, you may think I am being too harsh because what did I expect for a tablet in this price point? Well I expected my kindle fire. My kindle fire weighs a few more ounces and feels sturdier. I have had it for a year without a screen protector and no problems whatsoever. Screen is easy to read and highly responsive. Battery lasts usually about a week, even when I am reading 2-3 hours per day. I would have kept using my kindle fire exclusively, except that Google Hangouts does not work on the fire and I need Google Hangouts to be on-call for work (my boss will not simply call me). It took about 3 updates and 3 rebooting sessions for the neutab to NOT lockup when I tried to launch the hangouts app. I finally got the app working and that is probably the only thing I will use this device for."}

The screen feels like the material was not intended to be used as a screen. It just feels like plastic, and is extremely prone to scratching and cracking (the screens looked terrible after about a week of use). It seems like no measures were taken to prevent this. The actual screen picture and resolution is horrendous as well. Just looking at it you can tell how cheap it is.\n\n3 of the 4 that I bought just stopped turning on one day, 2 of them even started coming apart around the edges.\n\nIt just doesn't make sense to buy this when Amazon makes a much better quality tablet for the same price. Don't fall for the Google Play and Android buzzwords in the product title, they mean nothing. They can be installed on virtually any tablet which is why cheap tablet manufacturers use them."}

The screen is pretty clear, and it is reflective like the reviews said. The screen is also pretty fragile without the screen cover. I would suggest not touching the screen with anything but your hands before putting the cover on. I tried to get a little but of dust that had fallen on it without the cover with paper, and it scratched the screen. But it is not noticeable unless you really look. You can't really see it in the sunlight, which is pretty typical for the kind of screen that it is. It works pretty fast with wifi, it's not the fastest one out there, I'm sure, but you have to understand what you are getting for a $50 tablet. If you want a cheap tablet for surfing the web, videos, book reading and games, this is for you. If you are looking for a durable tablet with a great camera, you might want to look else where. Also, with some apps, it randomly turns off. I have not idea why. It also randomly turns on sometimes. One feature that I do like about it though is that if you set an alarm and then turn your tablet off, it will turn on to set the alarm off. All around, for me a good buy. I'm not picky, I just wanted to put all the things that I saw about it on here. For me it's pretty great. :)"}

I contacted the company through the Neutab website and after a few email exchanges they told me to ship it to them so they could service it or replace it.  The person I communicated with was helpful and I was overall very happy with how quickly they responded to my emails and how quickly they shipped me a replacement.  I just tried to use the replacement for the first time and was disappointed to find that the screen is offset and and that the screen is completely blank and white when turned on.  I've turned it on and off a few times and it makes the start up sounds but nothing comes up on the screen.  Don't think I'll bother emailing them again about the problems I'm having.  I don't think another replacement will be any better."}

Screen looks washed out with dim colors, the thing gets hot from the internal wifi antennae. Battery is pretty bad when wifi is used, and if you leave this alone for a few days, the battery will actually completely drain. The version of android it comes with is old and doesn't support certain apps, like Google Keep. I use it only for typing into Evernote and reading PDFs and ebooks on commutes.\n\nIf you want a real tablet that will serve you well, and hope to get that with a cheap one, I know the RCA is good and the one selling for the 50 dollar price mark has a higher version of android, but their screen isn't great either. Save up and get a better tablet from a trusted brand.\n\nIf I get a new tablet, this one will probably end up in my kitchen,"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "UPDATE - I purchased the first tablet on September 30th, today is October 19th. The tablet will power on but had weird lines going through the screen and the tablet is useless now. It has not fallen, been dropped or suffered any other misuse. I have contacted  Amazon about a replacement and if we continue to have issues we will be requesting a refund and looking for something different that will last.\n\nWe got a free tablet on our phone plan when we upgraded last year and since it was free, we gave it to the kids. While its a great tablet, the battery didn't last long, which frustrated the kids, and they were constantly fighting over it. We tried to solve this by giving them my husband's old tablet as well but that one is sadly on its last leg.\nThis started the hunt for new, yet affordable,tablets for the kids as they use them for everything (learning, watching videos, homeschool activities, etc). We decided on this one based on the reviews. We were so pleased with the first one that we ordered that we actually purchased a second one the day we got the first one.\nThis tablet is small yet large enough for what my kids use their tablets for and is easy for them to hold and easy to take on the go. Its Android, which is a big plus and I'm able to download all their favorite apps from the Google Play store for them and it has plenty of storage space for all their apps and other things. The camera isn't the greatest, but we didn't really buy it for the camera so that's not a huge deal for us. It charges amazingly fast, we were actually quite shocked by that and that's one of the biggest things that we love about it.\nReally, this is a great tablet for the price and we couldn't be happier with it, it is exactly what we were looking for."}

Prices of tablets have dropped a lot on the lower end tablets in the past few years, and this one cost about half what the prior tablet had.  This tablet met or exceeded all of my expectations.  No, it is not an iPad, it's not a Samsung Galaxy, but it also doesn't cost anywhere near what those tablets cost.  It has a much nicer screen than most of the lower end tablets, it has more internal memory than most of the lower end tablets, and it doesn't block the Google Play store and direct you to their own store with fewer apps like a lot of the lower end tablets to.  The processor speed has been more than adequate for anything I've tried to do with it.  No, it isn't just as good as an Apple as a Samsung.  However, I think most people would find that for $50 it is more than good enough.

When I opened the box the unit battery was at 85%, so rather than charging I went ahead and connected to my wireless router (less than 5 minutes).  Downloaded my NAS app, and bamb - streaming in less than 10 minutes from opening the box.  Smooth audio and video.  Sets up as easy as a smart phone, so I've yet to look at the user's guide.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "This tablet worked quite well! For about 2 days. Then I noticed a few things that concerned me, the first being that apps crashed left and right. Try to watch Amazon Video and not have it interrupted by frequent crashes, good luck. Secondly, I was unable to charge the battery from the actual charger, and had to do it via the USB port which worked quite well - until the next day, which was yesterday. One minute I was reading on my lunch break. I turn it to sleep mode, and I could not turn it back on. I know the battery wasn't dead because there was no drain icon.\n\nSo I feel like I wasted so much money on this. I would recommend purchasing a Phablet, perhaps even Dragon Touch, since I will personally never sully my hard-earned cash with this pos in the future."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "Firstly, there are much better options out there, but how many of those cost $50? So yeah, for the price, this is an excellent device! My primary complaint about this tablet is the narrow viewing angle. If you're looking at the top of the screen, the bottom part has a \"negative\" appearance. So if you're reading from top to bottom, you constantly have to tilt the tablet one way or another so that what you're reading is legible. I've noticed that white backgrounds are easier to read than black ones.\n\nThis thing looks and feels cheap. The buttons are in unusual locations. It runs Kitkat. It's under-powered & laggy. So why do I think it's a good deal? Because I bought it to read my digital magazines on. It works fine for that.\n\nPros:\nCheap\n\nCons:\n- Screen is reflective\n- Narrow viewing angle\n- Under powered\n- Cheap construction"}

My Kobo died after  2 years of working almost all day every day.  The Prontotec was cheap and I could get it quickly with Prime shipping, but after a couple of months, I dropped it and the power button broke...So the Zeepad was my next affordable choice.  Never again....the battery does not last.  I can't even get an hour out of it.\n\nSo, I have been in the market for a new tablet. Apart from the price.  I have been looking at battery life.  I'm so glad that I did a little bit of research before deciding on the NeuTab.  This baby is lightweight and built like both the Zeepad and the Prontotec, but you can certainly tell the difference in power, speed, and battery life.  I can run multiple programs at a time, without noticing delays.  I must also note that I do not make it a habit to have too many things open on my tablet.  All of the previous tablets I've had lagged (even if just one program was running).  Must be that quad core processor.  This would also be my first experience with Android KitKat, but Androids don't vary too much, so it's easy to use.\n\nI must finally note that when the description says 6 hours of battery life, believe it.  I normally will use it for a little while, then come back to it later.  So, I've been able to go a couple of days without having to charge it.  This is perfect for me.  My primary use for the tablet is reading. My reading apps don't use up too much power.  I like to use it mainly at church and around the house.\n\nI'm so glad I got this one.  I will take great care of it (get a case for it, don't let the kids play on it, etc...) and will probably get another one soon."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "This was a birthday gift for my daughter.  She was used the tablet for almost two months now.  Here is her review of it.\n\nOverall, the performance is great. When in its case, turning it vertically is not a great idea.  The screen goes a bit wonky and you can't really see anything on it very well.  Although it runs fast, sometimes I cannot use games because it says \"no network connection\". I have to go out of the game and go back in. The battery life is not very long, so I often keep it on its charger when I'm near a plug.  The advanced task killer really helps with keeping my tablet running fast. The charger does not have long reach, I'm afraid.  Some apps don't work all that well, but maybe that is just the apps.  Otherwise, a great tablet.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt is her tablet and I've only used it a couple times.  The screen is good if you are looking at it head-on, but not viewable from the side or most other angles.  This was to be expected based on price and other reviews I read, but I was still disappointed you can only see the screen clearly when holding it in just the right way.  This is our second NeuTab device and other than the screen issue, both have worked very well for budget tablets.  I would always recommend NeuTab if someone was looking for a nice, budget tablet for themselves or kids.  As long as you understand this is not a top of the line tablet and has its limitations, you can't go wrong purchasing a NeuTab."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "1. The first thing I noticed was a slight gap between the faceplate and the housing where the power button is located - not a huge problem, but it made it look shoddily put together.\n2. Set-up was smooth, but count-down for the battery icon was very distracting, mainly because of how quickly the percentage points dropped while the device was more or less idle (one example: immediately after charging the battery I walked about 40 feet from my room to the kitchen and sat down - during that time the battery meter dropped from 99% to 89% - that was without opening any apps). Maybe the battery meter was defective. I never timed how long I could get use out of the tablet before having to recharge, but it wasn't much. Recharging was quick - about 2.5 hours.\n3. Even though the tablet is advertised as \"3d Game Supported\" the games I tried lagged and crashed. The item's picture on Amazon shows a Clash of Clans icon on the screen - I doubt it would be playable.\n4. I bought this mainly for handy web-browsing. Chrome crashed every single time I used it. So I installed Dolphin - that allowed me to read some pages that quickly crashed with Chrome, but the lag was still very poor, and it did crash about half the time. I also tried Firefox with the Adblock Plus extension - just as bad as Chrome. I downloaded and used the app killer recommended in the tablet's paperwork, but it didn't help the situation.\n5. Held horizontally, the viewing angle from side to side wasn't too bad, but tilt it back an inch or two and the image becomes very obscured.\n6. I was surprised about the one decent thing with this tablet - Youtube worked. I watched the Star Wars: The Old Republic videos, which are pretty visually intensive, and they looked ok. I'm not sure why that works while browsers and games do not.\n\nIn conclusion,I wasn't expecting much for $50, but after reading many of the positive reviews here I'm surprised at how little this machine could function. It may have been defective."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "Great bargain tablet! This is my first Android tablet. I'm teaching myself Android development, and I wanted something super simple for deploying my apps onto tablets for testing. This one is a great buy for this purpose. It's packed with features (bluetooth, wifi, microSD slot, forward/rear cameras, etc) and is plenty speedy thanks to its quad-core processor. I'd be lying if I said I didn't use it for watching some Netflix and YouTube in addition to my dev purposes. Works fine there as well.\nThe only areas I've seen where quality could be improved were in the resolution of the screen and the camera. But, given the price, overall quality, and my specific needs, these issues are relatively minor. Individuals looking to use this as a 2nd camera or videophiles looking for a media tablet should keep looking. Otherwise, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this tablet.\nOnly reason I took off a star is because of the lack of dedicated hardware keys (maybe this is standard, like I said, this is my first tablet). And the extremely limited viewing angle of the screen is a major bummer, even for my development purposes."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "I was skeptical about the quality of this tablet compared to the price, but figured I'd give it a try. My five and six year old kids really put their RCA Voyagers through the ringer since Christmas and my five year old's finally bit the dust. So I bought her a new RCA Voyager. Then a week later, my six year old's tablet started responding much slower than usual. This time, I knew I had the leisure to go out and shop around a bit online. So after much comparison and reading SO MANY reviews, I went ahead and bought the NeuTab. This was already a win because it was cheaper than the RCA I bought my daughter at Wal-Mart.\nUpon delivery, I was really surprised how much nicer the packaging was than my daughter's RCA.It looked like a bit more thought and quality went into this alone. The tablet itself is more aesthetically pleasing than the RCA. The performance and options are superior to the RCA. It is just a really nice little tablet for the money! I am already looking at purchasing another one because I'm kind of worried that as people catch on to the value, the price might actually go up a bit.\nOverall, I'm really happy that I took the chance on this brand and this bargain. I will definitely be doing it again."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "I wanted something light and easy to handle, to use as a digital portfolio for my photography business. This tables cost less that it would have been to print portraits to show my clients. I can access my website, Flickr, Facebook business page and show client my work, and I can update my work on any of these site to keep my work fresh for advertising and I never have to constantly reprint work for a portfolio when I can just pull out my table D The image quality and color on the table are as clear as the portraits and images are when they were taken. I can zoom in and the detail are just as sharp. I use my table anywhere there is free wifi and I can watch my Neflix movies, use Facebook etc.  The dual camera is a bonus when I am at a location and need to refer back to lighting and space I may need for equipment set up. I love the product. Way more affordable than an iPad and just as useful."}

She is in Haiti me i was at delaware when i placed the order to be delivered at florida and when i came back the firs thing i touch is the tablet. I was very, very, very mad when i pressed the power key and nothing, take out the charger and plug it, nothing on the screen, i let it pluged think the battery was very low, after one hour, nothing. I wasn't able to believe that. What im gonna say to her. I return it till to now they never give me the money back.\n\nBuy on amazon is a risk, sometime you find good products and sometime you waste and lose money. You can buy the same tablet and it comes very good but mine was good. Just consider the 1 star is for me."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "Great value for the price. Will lag behind mid-high budget tablets but probably as competitive as anything you will find for 50 bucks. I have owned a Motorolla Xoom tablet for 3 years now. It is getting long in the tooth and has some issues so I decided to pick up one of these as a bridge until next year when I will probably go all out and get another high end tablet. So far I like it. The screen isn't the best when compared to my Xoom but its still very good compared to other low end devices. A lot of the hardware in this tablet actually surpasses my Xoom which is nice, it rums more fluidly and is more portable. For the price its hard to pass up. Great for first time tablet buyers as well."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "Was hesitant at first, but the product proved me wrong! As my first purchase of a tablet, I needed something that would be able to just do tasks such as typing documents and hold my scanned files for my classes. Many of my peers boast about their tablets ranging from Samsung, Ipad mini, LG, and even Nabi that can cost more than my basic laptop!? No way! I needed something budget friendly, that had the basic needs on every tablet (as though it was a laptop/phone), and had access to Google Play instead of automatically trying to download and fail. This product was it! The bonus for me was that the tablet had access to Bluetooth which connected wonderfully with my Bluetooth headphones!\n\nThe reviews from other customers did warn me of the RAM amount when it comes to multi-tasking. Even the battery shortage would be an average of 2-3 hours, but I never owned a tablet and just needed one instead of hauling my laptop everywhere around my university. Google drive is a major help in my assignments and finally being able to have easier access to eBooks. A miracle with this tablet! You have to lighten the load because even books from college become a burden.\n\nI think the only issue I have is the performance with one Google Play game called Final Fantasy Record Keeper (I adore JRPG playing). Probably the only game I play besides an occasion Angry Birds out of boredom. The instructions did mention an app from Google Play to boost the the performance and I thank tech support for mentioning it. It even extended my battery life! Still, I'm remotely satisfied with the outcome of my new purchase and hope that the company continues to produce excellent  products like this."}

It would disconnect from Wifi, and would not automatically reconnect.  He would have to manually select the Wifi to get it to reconnect.\n\nOnce reconnected it would work fine while he was using the tablet, but if it would go into hibernation, it would disconnect again.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "Absolutely a great buy!  I have a NeuTab brand tablet of my own, so when my son wanted one for his 12th birthday it was only natural that I was going to buy him a brand I knew and trusted.  I was curious if it was going to hold up to the abuse of a 12 year old, because I am not very rough with mine, nor do I use it excessively like I knew my son would.  So far, the tablet has taken everything he's put it through, and could probably withstand much more.  No issues downloading anything my son has wanted, it runs his music and apps seamlessly, and the battery life is incredible!  I know there are many different brands out there in this price range, but you will not find this quality at this price anywhere else, nor will you find a tablet in this price range that is Bluetooth compatible.  Now my other son wants one for Christmas and if he is lucky enough to get one, I'm sure you can all guess what brand the tablet will be...NeuTab!!!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "I purchased two of these because i couldn't beat the price and the tablet. i I loaded everything on there for my children and they are working great.  I plan to watch them closely and see how well they keep functioning and will re-post another review here in a few weeks.  These are great tablets for the price and even if not for the price they are functioning very well.  You tube streams properly, so do movies, etc.  We purchased the expansion cards bc of the limited memory and an external battery charger.  I noticed my kids were able to get a good 3-3.5 hours of continual play on these on full charge.  The external batter charger ($9.99 3200mah) works very well when they are at low battery and could possibly play 3 more hours (which they shouldn't be doing).  I just wanted to test these out to be aware of their battery life and the next day we let them die down and plugged it up to the external battery.  The sound, the screen image quality is great and going from app to app is quick.  I have an ipad and a windows surface...these work better than the surface IMO my husband keeps having windows problems with his he commented he should get one of these.  we also purchased the cover folio that goes with this as my kids may drop and didn't know how these would hold up so i wanted to help these little tablets along as much as i could.  oh and the head phones work great on these as well.  i haven't had an issue only on my son's where the wifi was flickering on and off but not enough to stop him from streaming his video and it froze one time that i know of but i was doing a bunch of downloading and setting up his tablet so that may be it; however, i am keeping an eye out on these issues and have asked my son to let me know.  i disconnected wifi and reconnected with password and it still flickered but again it didn't stop the streaming.  Overall, extremely happy with these tablets and i highly recommend these for any age. will re-post progress in a few weeks."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "This tablet is Okay. For the price it is great. I turned off all of the options in order to maximize its performance. What I use it for is YouTube for my kids, and reading. Some apps crash on it  (Crossyroad, Clash of Clans, Relax and Sleep). These apps do not crash every time it is random. I think it is due to the lack of RAM. The screen is pretty bad, it has a bad glare and your line of site has to be pretty direct in order to see it clearly. The speaker is also pretty bad. It isn't loud and the quality is poor. I use Bluetooth headphones for sound. The blue tooth is good. The WIFI is 2.4 only but works well. It is also slow to load the home screen. I recommend an app that keeps your RAM clear. All that being said if you want a tablet for watching video or reading this is not bad. Once an app is loaded (which can take some time) It usually works well."}

Be sure to have a case on it. After about 6 month one stopped working and had charging issues leading up to that for a month or two before hand. There were some items from the play store that just wouldn't download. We have a Samsung tablet that has been dropped and still works just fine (unlike these). The price of these were really appealing considering the name brand ones."}

There is also a pixel that is out it doesn't bother me only when i notice it. The last thing i don't like is that the screen bothers my eyes it has a gloss sort of effect to it and it makes it like a mirror and it just bothers my eyes."}

I was happily surprised when I received them! The build felt solid and they were pretty fast. I was able to customize them to use as a home control and they worked perfectly. The items I'm running from them are Sonos, Logitech Harmony, Nest and Wink. If you use Wink, the Google Play store says the app is incompatible with this device. However, a quick Google search for the Wink APK provided a downloadable file that installed perfectly.\n\nAfter about 40 days (just outside the return window), one of the tablets completely died. Wouldn't boot. So I sent an email to the seller through Amazon, and they immediately shipped out a replacement. Amazing customer service! It's not an iPad replacement, but it was the perfect option for my needs."}

The time is always 12 hours ahead of EST.  I suppose this is because it was made in China and set there permanently.  I have spent hours trying to figure how to change it.  As soon as we go off daylight savings time, it will be 13 hours off and this will be a real hassel, not just an inconvenience as it is now.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "I am giving this tablet 4 stars, only because it is a decent tablet- for the price. Let me make the \"for the price\" clearer. It is a very cheap tablet...as tablets run. I think I had my expectations set too high in this case. This tablet runs pretty smooth, although I have yet to add more than 2 apps of my own since set up. Battery life leaves more to be desired. In sleep mode, the battery is decent. While using the tablet, the battery life seems to drop a percentage every minute your using it. Some of the bugs we've been discovering include:1) the Wi-Fi does not stay connected. It blinks on and off while using it, which gets very frustrating. 2) While attempting to load a local news website, (keep in mind, the battery drops a percentage per minute during use) it went from 33% - 27% and the page had not yet completely loaded. I do not believe the internet usage in our home could have been a factor, we do have high speed, but at that time, we only had one other thing connected and running off our internet. The camera in this tablet is basic, low grade picture quality. I have not attempted streaming video as of yet. Pandora played smoothly, speaker quality is clear, crisp and decently loud. Game play is good, as long as it is not downloading at the time. The tablet itself is very light weight, cheap feeling almost. Would I purchase this again? Maybe for a young child to play games on, or if that was the only intention I had when purchasing it. This is not something you would want to surf the internet on. Purely a tablet for gaming apps and leisure.  Like I stated above- you get what you pay for."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "It is a decent product for the price, don't get me wrong, but I set my bar way to high before I ordered this product. I have another tablet I got from Verizon and I wanted to upgrade. I thought this would be the upgrade but it falls short in several areas: the battery life, a little slower with using apps, and does not work well when trying to stream from it to my chromecast.\n\nThe battery life on this product, in my opinion, feels like a timer counting down; I literally watched the percent just steadily decrease and it just pained me to know that I would have to charge it again so very soon! :( I might be spoiled by the battery life on my other tablet, but it does not take away from the fact that it is disappointing.\n\nI am the kind of guy who switches between apps like a mad man. It took several seconds longer to change apps on this tablet over my other one. Several seconds may not sound like much but it seems like an eternity sometimes. YouTube is also much slower on this tablet for some reason - maybe it's just a defect on my product, I am not sure.\n\nI like to use my tablet to stream through my chromecast but this tablet was having a difficulty changing between videos; it even went as far as to freezing at one point - this was a consistent occurrence and was very disappointing.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a good tablet for anyone just coming onto the scene of the tablet industry; for those of us who have owned a tablet before, this is probably not the best choice but it can be livable.\n\nP.s. Part of the screen when flipped in a certain way does not work; fortunately enough, I do not use that part of the screen at all so it can be ignored."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "Woow beginner's tablet. It runs a Android KitKat OS. It has access to the Google Play Store and as far as the actual operating system and default apps are concerned, it is no different than my Samsung Galaxy. I've read other reviews here that have warned of pre-installed titles of a questionable nature being discovered and am happy to report that there were no apps installed that weren't standard fare (media player, optimizer app, etc.) for pretty much every Android device out there, regardless of manufacturer.\n\nThe N7 Pro has run all the apps I've asked it to, including Minecraft PE, without much fuss. It doesn't have much RAM, but if you keep the running apps to a minimum, you won't have any problems. Media playback on Plex, Youtube, Netflix and Hulu works great.\n\nThe Both the Cameras are very basic to have snaps. That's the only thing I found not great.\n\nThe device is sturdy enough to stand up to daily use, and doesn't flex easily in your hands (not that you should try it, but kids do weird things sometimes). The white color I like, but it has no bearing on usability.\n\nI'd say that this is a good entry level tablet for the money and as long as you manage your expectations appropriately, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this Tab.\n\nOverall good buy and nice selection !!"}

It is so slow that I had to get another mobile WiFi way to do hangouts, check mail, frequently check a few website.  I saw this tablet was highly rated and the price was very good, almost too good to be what I wanted.  I was very concerned abou\nt the small amount of RAM (512mb). It appears NeuTab has optimized the KitKat OS for speed with small RAM.\nI have kept the installed application to a minimum, similar to what i had when the Nexus 7 was new. It is very responsive.  Using it I don't have to wait minutes to display what I want (literally).\nThis is an update. I still like the NeuTab but it has a serious flaw. When t goes to sleep the WiFi shuts off regardless of the WiFi settings this means that notifications do not happen. Therefore I miss hangouts from my friend. Very Bad!!!\nFeatures are: Bluetooth -- needed to run Torque (which works well),\n  Google Play pre-installed (easy to add apps and update them),\n  Good size battery (3775mAh  according to Battery Monitor Widget)\nCons: Camera resolution is poor.\n  Some areas of the screen are hard to make the touch work.\nI recommend this for anyone wants a low cost, responsive tablet. Very impressive!"}

I believe its a defective inlet for the power cord. Neutab sent me another one as part of the warrenty. Again same problem won't charge same as last tablet. 2 tablet s in less then 6 months. Its definitely a manufacturer defect in these Tablets .Now Im gonna send second one back for a replacement. The problem is they keep sending me the same defective tablet design. Without fixing the problem . So it's a great tablet but will not last longer then 2 months stops charging. Im hoping neu tab doesnt sent me another defective tablet.  Shipping has cost me $25.00 for the 2 tablets\nAnd appear to be a waste of money. What happen to customer service?  Or correcting the problem.\nThanks\nDean"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "I've owned 3 other droid tabllets (not same seller) that died almost immediately. I'll update if that is an issue with this one. I try to write my reviews after a week or so but they are offering a case if I post a review so doing so now. FYI a lot of sellers do this, it is important to note the review doesn't have to be positive so don't worry about that influencing.\n\nI'm not a very tech savy person, but am pretty familiar with droid as my smartphone is a droid. I paid for next day shipping, had by 10 AM next day.\n\nI work online and my laptop died on Friday. Needed a quick replacement until I can afford computer repair.$60 with one day shipping seemed like a steal.\n\nArrived well packaged. Looked and felt like what I expected. Yes back is an inexpensive plastic, if I wanted expensive feel would have ordered expensive. The tap screen works reasonably well. I do have some issue accessing the app shortcut icon on right hand side of screen, I quickly saved setting icon to home screen to avoid that frustration.\n\nAll I really need it for is to access Google docs, as most my clients use Google for teleworking. I do have one who uses Microsoft. I'm able to access my Microsoft Home Office no problem. I save everything in Dropbox or OneDrive so storage space not an issue.\n\nI only play Forge of Empires and haven't had any tablet related issues doing so.\n\nI've downloaded Skype, but need to contact them regarding connecting Bluetooth, I wish that had been included in instruction manual.\n\nOh speed. Well it is slower than my laptop but that is to be expected. I live in a townhouse, the router is in upstairs bedroom and I have no WiFi issues.\n\nThe seller also includes a screen guard.. So when you consider a decent basic tablet, a case (with review) plus screen cover $50 a darn good deal."}

The screen throws off a lot of glare but I haven't tried netflix or hulu yet to see if it is usable as a streaming device.\n\nNot all playstore apps are compatible with the device (weather channel and yelp to name a few).\n\nThe camera is kind of a joke.\n\nOverall, I am giving it 4 stars because, for the price, it does the job and you can't really expect much else, however, it doesn't get 5 stars because there are blatant shortcuts in screen and camera quality."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "I was looking for an inexpensive android tablet to take some home automation products on a test drive; the tablet was really second over the home automation products, so my expectations were pretty minimal:  run the automation software I need, access my Amazon Echo and my Amazon cloud music account.  This product easily managed this.  The product is plastic, and feels rather cheap; but it is rugged, I have managed to send it flying off the couch several times at a fairly high velocity onto the hardwood floor without any problems.  There are no bells and whistles on it; but it is doing everything I asked for reliably.  The battery is adequate; probably 2 days without doing much; but my plan is too mount it into a permanent niche so the battery length was not something I am really concerned with.  All-in-all, does everything I have asked of it so far."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "I would only recommend this tablet for those who want a simple tablet, nothing else.  It's working great for my purpose, which was intended for my child.  The flaws I would consider are:  the screen quality, reactive time after touching the screen is not as fast, and WiFi connection goes in and out inside home.  The screen quality feels like it's made of plastic.  The definition of the screen works best if it's at an angle, instead of the tablet facing straight in front of you.  I've noticed that allowing the tablet to lay flat on the table while using it, has less of that 3D effect on my eyes.  Second, the reactive time is quite slow after tapping on the screen.  When I select something, I sometimes would have to keep tapping it until I get a response.  And lastly, the WIFI connection sometimes goes off and on while I'm at home.  I don't think the signal strength on these tablets are strong enough.  However, it doesn't seem to bother my child much.  He still enjoys using this.  And I'd make sure to have a protective case on these tablets.  It's lightweight, but more of a \"toy-type\" plastic feel.  The battery life drains sorta fast.  From being 100% charged, after an hour of continuous usage, it went down to 70%."}

The screen on the right side is not responsive to touch and I have to turn upside down to use it. The biggest annoyance is really this bright blue line that cuts through the center of the display. I could probably live with this annoying line and deal with flipping the screen to use it since I bought it cheaply knowing it would only be used in the kitchen for my recipes, but as it has two issues at the initial unboxing, I will return this item for fear of more issues"}

The tablet looked okay, but the construction felt a bit flimsy to me, and felt a bit clumsy to use. Often had to tap icons several times before they'd open. Wi-Fi connection doesn't have great range, so it was unreliable when upstairs, but worked okay when downstairs near my router. I do like the fact that this tablet allows user accounts, so I could share with my husband. You get what you pay for, so it's okay, for a first-time tablet, but I would definitely buy a more expensive model for regular use if I decided to get rid of my Kindle Fire."}

There were also two scratches on the screen even though the packaging was pristine. Even so, I checked the tablet's performance. It was good enough for what I intended (i.e., what you'd expect from a $50 tablet), but it was running Android 4.4. When I looked under Settings for a way to update it, I found no option to even check for updates. The only updates are offered from the manufacturer's web site, and 4.4 is the newest version available, even though Android 5.1 is out. Furthermore, the tablet arrived with USB Debugging enabled. Given that this tablet is from China, I now have doubts that I'll ever be able to secure it. I'm returning it for a refund."}

Unfortunately they claim nothing was wrong with the tablet even though you can clearly see its blurry. Bottom line is don't waste your money.

I understand this tablets quality isn't going to be great but I was expecting at the very minimum a decent screen. I gave it 2 stars because the screen is \"3d\" but it hurts your eyes tremendously. After messing with it for 3 minutes my eyes started hurting. Everyone's warning about the wifi going in and out is a true statement this morning it went out while my wife was using it. I turned it off and back on and it started working again. The good thing about this tablet is the volume and sound is above average. You can turn it up to a decent volume (I'm hard hearing). The touch screen works. I was worried about that but it works pretty good. And if you like more than 10 apps you need to find another tablet. If you need a quick fix then waste your money. This isn't a completely horrible tablet but if I was to price it I would put the value between 25-35 dollars. I also want to say if you need to buy a product please purchase it from Amazon because their customer service is the greatest I can return this tablet within 30 days and this is the best part. Amazon called me when I requested them to do so instead of me waiting on hold or talking to a computer voice. I'm completely satisfied with Amazon!"}

The housing on the second was so offset that the camera was obstructed and the charger wouldn't connect. Truly disappointing!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "Updated review:\nAfter 3 months, the charger port lost its solder integrity and I had to open it up and re-solder it myself. It kept breaking, so I had to start charging it via the microUSB port, which was fine, but then the same thing started happening to that port. 6 months after purchase, the tablet started spontaneously rebooting, and now 7 months after purchase, it shuts down completely at random. I would NOT recommend this tablet even if you think it's your only option. Save up a little more and buy a Kindle Fire HD 6 or 7.\n\nOriginal review:\nGreat beginner's tablet. It runs a vanilla Android Kit Kat OS and that's a good thing. It has access to the Google Play Store and as far as the actual operating system and default apps are concerned, it is no different than my Moto G. I've read other reviews here that have warned of pre-installed titles of a questionable nature being discovered and am happy to report that there were no apps installed that weren't standard fare (media player, optimizer app, etc.) for pretty much every Android device out there, regardless of manufacturer.\n\nThe N7 Pro has run all the apps I've asked it to, including Minecraft PE, without much fuss. It doesn't have much RAM, but if you keep the running apps to a minimum, you won't have any problems. Media playback on Plex, Youtube, Netflix and Hulu works great.\n\nThe device is sturdy enough to stand up to daily use, and doesn't flex easily in your hands (not that you should try it, but kids do weird things sometimes). The white color and Christmas decorations on the back are hidden by the case we bought for it, but it has no bearing on usability.\n\nI'd say that this is a good entry level tablet for the money and as long as you manage your expectations appropriately, I don't think you'll be disappointed."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "This is my first tablet. Bought it for my 4 year old son for playing toddler games. For me, I am a Computer idiot and have zero experience about an iPad or Google Android Tablet PC. 7 inches screen is big enough for simple games for a toddler. Back to the tablet itself, I simply tested it a little bit. The internet speed or WiFi is fast when I browsing the Web so I am happy! The camera has font and rear facing just like an smart phone. It also come with some handful apps which I haven't have a chance to play with. Well, I don't do a lot of things with a Tablet PC, just web browsing and watch some videos/movies and that's it. Overall both me and my son are satisfied with this product, lol."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "Junk!!! Won't stay connected to wifi even though all my other devices work perfectly. Doesn't hold charge as well. Apps continuously stops working. I've even tried a full factory reset and the it's the same. The display is dim, the only good thing about it, is the processing speed to run apps. I wish it didn't have those problems but it does.\n\nOther reviews here about this are so fake. They got an extended warranty for it to leave good reviews."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00PMDEAYW", "review": "I really wish I hadn't caved in and bought a cheaper tablet for Chirstmas, because I definitely regret not going for a bigger brand, like Samsung or HTC.\n\nFirst of all, it's performance is absolute garbage, despite what it advertises what it seems to be. Takes forever to move through running apps and is extremely sluggish when doing simple tasks. On top of that, constant freezing/crashing when loading HTML5 video, playing on many apps, and even basic internet browsing on Chrome. My Samsung Galaxy S3 out-performs it in every way, despite being an older device. It also doesn't help that the hard-drive on mine was 2 GB when it was advertised as 8.\n\nDon't believe in the advertised camera quality either. Pictures come out looking like the lens was covered in frosted glass, with horrendous quality and fuzzy images. Also the video recording is extremely laggy.\n\nOn top of that, for whatever reason, on the corners of my tablet, there are extremely bright white lights that shine through the back of the case (which is made by a really cheap material that bends easily, by the way) and is very obnoxious/distracting in dark environments.\n\nThe touch calibration is also awful. The pointer is almost always nowhere near my finger and takes many tries before I can press a button/tab accurately. On top of that, the screen continues on the left pass the black area, so part of the display is \"missing\" in a way. On top of that, you cannot re-calibrate the touchpad, so you're stuck screwing around with your finger on the screen.\n\nIt also came with a ton of bloatware apps, like performance boosting apps or cleaning apps that barely work. In fact, these apps always show pop-up menus or are impossible to exit out of, so they constantly get in your way until you uninstall them.\n\nTo top of this heaping pile of garbage, the display is not as great as they advertise it to be. I can literally count the pixels on the screen. Following this, my wallpaper always re-sizes itself whenever i go back to the home menu, incredibly zoomed in so it looks awful. I constantly have to go back and re-set my wallpaper, only to have it resized and zoomed in all the way again.\n\nPlease, muster up the will to spend an extra $50 dollars or so to get a better brand tablet, because this genuinely isn't worth the money at all."}

Constant updates that took up the majority of space on the tablet, the USB charger port broke, the battery became next to impossible to keep charged, and often at times you had to keep it on the AC charger to keep it working. Then, video playback became odd, it wouldn't run anything at 60fps, YouTube video colors were shades of blue and never played video, only audio, and apps constantly shut down without warning. Buy with caution."}
