I'll re-visit this after I have the tablet in hand.\n\n##############################\n\nLong over-do review (5/21/2012):\n\nThis product is excellent. The screen is beyond gorgeous (I've tried the HP TouchPad, iPad 2 and HTC Evo View 4G), it blows away any other tablets I've used. While it's not perfect outside the display is bright enough that it can still be used outdoors. The successor to this (TF201) is said to have increased the brightness further to the point of being able to use it seamlessly outdoors. The only downer on this particular display is that my unit seems to have experienced some light bleed around the right edge of the screen. It's nothing too bad and I really only notice it if I'm on a black screen in a dark room.\n\nThe fit and finish of the device leave something to be desired, with the plastic back-casing having odd creaks. I've read on various forums that you can disassemble the unit and correct the creaking but it's such a minor inconvenience I've never done so.\n\nIn terms of speed and usage this device really shines here. The Tegra 2 is more than able to keep up with just about anything you throw at it. I've watched 1080p videos on this (as output to a TV, not using MKV) with no hiccups. The other nice benefit is that out of the box you get all of the Tegra specific games compatibility without any dancing around with ChainFire to spoof the games into working.\n\nIn terms of software this device truly shines. ASUS is STILL releasing updates for this tablet, in addition to including useful programs with the tablet (and rolling out new ASUS software, such as their stylus input program which works amazing well!). ASUS truly sets the bar with software updates on their devices and this is a shining crown to that achievement. The fact that they actually published ICS for the tablet, and with due haste speaks volumes about their commitment to the Android community.\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend this device. Especially now that it's a little older you can find it at bargain prices! If given the opportunity to purchase this device for $200 you won't be disappointed. Even a bit more and it's still a good buy."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I got this tablet when it first came out and it was probably the worst tablet I have ever had the dissatisfaction of owning. Slow (even when it was new)... Lagged on even a 720p youtube video and swiping between home screens with little to no app icons. Standby time was horrendous. The keyboard dock was a huge disappointment. It gave extra battery when it was charged, but drained its own battery without even doing anything within 24 hours, and since it drained itself so quickly it would leach power from the tablet itself resulting in even worse battery life. The dock battery issue was widely known by yet nothing was done to fix it. Mainly performance was the worst part though. Pretty unacceptable seeing it cost me $300 + $150 for the dock."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "The Asus Eee Pad Transformer TF101-A1 was bought new in the Fall of 2011, replacing an old HP Compaq TC1100 I had been using as my writing workhorse (which still fires up but is too slow). A friend bought the docking keyboard for me a few months later, which became my new writing workhorse. At that time, Honeycomb was the Android OS and worked good. I like the Mocha color and rough texture on the outside. The screen is 10.1, good for writing, internet research but not much else, with the 1 G Ram and small 16 G harddrive. At that time, neither the two SD card slots would read/write and the USB could be tricky to read/write as well. The update to Ice Cream Sandwich fixed a lot of issues I had been having with the hardware, but slowed down the software. I had to delete some apps to the very least I could get away with and still be productive.\n\nAfter a few years I had to do several resets, reload ICE and the tablet was performing well. Not great, but well. I'm still using the TF101 when i'm at a coffee house or meeting friends to show my website or linkedin profile. The keyboard is just big enough to work on but will duplicate or skip letters because I type so fast. Booting takes up to two minutes, but it is a five year old tablet. I use google docs, drive and spreadsheet and it works pretty good.\n\nAs much as I love using this old tablet and dock, i'd like to trade it in for the newer Asus Transformer Book T100-HA."}

I have a Note 10.1 which I love but needed an older unit with a mini hdmi and an older bluetooth version for my Icade. The Tf101 fit the bill and works well for both purposes. It's an older unit so obviously it can't compete with newer high end tablets but it's a solid unit with good features. I am happy with the purchase.\n\nThe unit was inexpensive so I don't mind if my 3 year plays around on it once and a while. Additionally it's pretty cool that I can easily mirror the screen using a mini hdmi cable. Works well and looks good on the big screen. The unit is also touch sensitive and responsive. If your looking for an older tablet to use around the house the Asus is a solid choice."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Everyone else has covered this tablet in great detail ... at this point given the tablet is about four years old as I write this review (February 2015, tablet came out in Nov 2011 when I first purchased it) I'm guessing you're probably looking to buy a dirt-cheap (by tablet standards anyways) used version of this tablet.\n\nBearing in mind that modern day tablets will no doubt be much more powerful/robust/faster than this one.. I can still assure you that if you're not picky about your tablets this one will be more than sufficient... I let myself be fooled by the cheaper new tablets that run so painfully slowly that they're not even worth it (check out my review of the Sylvania SYTAB10MT 10-Inch Magni Tablet for one such horror story)... for a bit more than a new tablet that will function like a piece of crap you can get a used version of this tablet instead and be much happier.... I still find this tablet to be quick, responsive, and reliable even four years after purchasing it... at the time I purchased it I believe it won awards of some sort for being the top tablet performer in it's class (or close to the top anyways) in the year 2011 which was the deciding factor for me.\n\n.....your one BIG drawback is the design flaw on the power button which has been known to \"sink\" into the case sometimes making it difficult to turn the tablet on and off (you can imagine what an issue that would be)... back in the old days when I purchased this brand new squaretrade came to my rescue and paid for shipping and handling both mailing the tablet to them and back to get the power button fixed (they replaced the whole dang motherboard in the tablet for me ! ) ... doing so \"exhausted\" my warranty such that it was no longer covered but I was still quite happy (thanks squaretrade !  :)  ) ... I don't think squaretrade will offer a warranty for a used tablet though (maybe I'm wrong?) ... there's a video online that describes how to fix the power button problem with a cut off piece of old credit card but this assumes you're comfortable opening up your asus tablet and doing the repairs yourself (do a google search for \"tampatec\", \"How to open and fix asus tablet\" for a video... and also do a google search for \"xda-developers\" \"bukithd\" and \"possible power button fix\" for written instructions... really wish amazon would let us just insert links to websites instead !  )\n\nMy children were quite happy using the tablet for videos, walk-throughs when they're stuck on a particular video game... I used the tablet to read comic books and pdf's (though make sure the pdf you purchase is \"tablet friendly\" ... if it's too \"rich\" in graphics and other content the asus tablet will struggle  with it )  and was satisfied for the most part with it's performance (there was the occasional \"error you can't read this comic book!\" type thing but my research indicates it's a problem with comic book readers in general not the asus tablet... if someone has had a different experience feel free to leave a comment on here of course ! ) ...  sound is okay coming from the tiny speakers (what can you expect?) but plug a headphone in and you'll be happy.. definitely splurge for the micro SD card you can slot into it to increase storage, those little things are cheap as all heck nowadays especially say during a Black Friday or Cyber Monday or Christmas sale... I did not bother using the tablet to take pictures, conduct skype or other video calls or the like so can't speak to the tablet's performance in this regard.\n\nI never bothered purchasing the keyboard you can plug into this and was quite happy with the tablet's performance even without it.  For all I know said keyboard might make it even better/easier to use turning it into a \"mini computer\" of sorts who knows?  And I believe the keyboard lets you plug additional sd cards in for additional storage ? ...  Not sure if you will end up getting the charger with this or not if you buy it used.. I ended up purchasing the EastVita Asus Eee Pad Transformer TF101 Wall Charger Power Adapter back in Dec 2012 to replace the data cable/power cable plug into the wall/transfer data onto the cable thing that originally came with the asus tablet when I bought it new (the asus original was NOT built to last and started falling apart on me ) .. I've been very happy with the new charger works like a charm even now 3 years later... of course now that the failing data cable / power supply thing that Asus originally enclosed fell apart on me completely now I need to purchase a new cable to transfer data back and forth between the asus tablet and the PC (though there's a \"workaround\" if you put the data on the SD card and plug that into the PC then plug the SD card back into the tablet)... I'll try to remember to update this review with the data cable I purchased and let you know how it worked... (EDIT AND UPDATE.. the charger stopped working for me in March 2015, a little over 3 years after purchasing it.... given how finicky electronics can be I'm not that upset about it, especially given how cheap it's selling for!  I ended up just buying a new one that's working great right out of the box far as charging my tablet.. Even given the 3 year lifespan it's still put together much more solidly/much sturdier than the \"official\" asus charger/usb sync cable combo that literally fell apart on me after my first year of using it.  I'd recommend buying this charger, using it exclusively to charge the tablet, and saving the sync/charging cord that comes with the tablet solely for syncing info / downloading stuff between the PC and your tablet)\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a cheap budget used tablet that won't break the bank you'll be quite happy with this... obviously if you're buying used make sure you're purchasing it from has a decent return policy (talk to the seller beforehand maybe?) in case the tablet isn't working properly when it gets to you in the mail...\n\nEDIT AND UPDATE... shortly after posting this review started having problems charging the tablet .. but in all fairness, four year old tablet, you would expect the battery in the tablet to die after four  years of usage anyways (given how heavily we were using the tablet to begin with)... this may be a problem for you if you are buying this tablet used, which I'm sure will be the case (why pay the retail price for this when newer tablets for the same price are probably faster, more  powerful and so forth?  Again as mentioned above makes a great used tablet if you don't need the \"latest and greatest\" tablet).... in this case google search is your friend as far as instructional videos.. search for the following terms ... youtube, NewLife2OldStuff, asus TF-101 (or  TF101), and replace battery ... then do a second search with the same words except replace NewLife2OldStuff with trinhkets... this should result in two videos (which should hopefully be still posted and up there on the internet by the time you read this review) that both teach you how to replace the battery in your tablet, the first video takes you through it nice and slow step by step, the second video is a bit too fast in my opinion but it tells you the tools and type of battery you'll need to purchase...\n\nThe videos make it look like a big scary complicated deal replacing the battery.. but honestly, it's not, I did it, the most annoying thing for me was prying the outer case off the tablet to get at the insides of it and after that no big deal ... the tools and battery that you need are relatively cheap on certain websites (such as the one beginning with \"e\" and ending with \"y\" that is amazon's biggest competition) when you compare it to the cost of bringing this tablet in to a professional which would NOT be worth the cost in labor they'd charge you in my opinion (assuming the professional would even bother  to replace a battery in a tablet this old to begin with... the professional in my area said the battery was too old for them to keep in stock anymore, the other professional I e-mailed never got back to me about it so that probably tells you something right there)... You'll need a t-5 screwdriver/stardriver, a phillips head screwdriver  sized for 000 size screws, and a prying tool for electronics (a search for those key words on amazon's biggest competition as mentioned above should turn them up easily) and of course the asus tf-101 (or you can just type asus tf101) battery (which can also be found on that \"other\" website).\n\nBattery replacement may be a necessity given that you'd be buying this tablet used.. then again maybe the previous owner was a \"light\" tablet user and you won't need to replace the battery for a long while?  Opening this up will void your warranty but.. then again if you're buying this used from some third party seller (unless Asus has some sort of strange sale where they sell these with a \"limited warranty\" or something ) then you might not be able to take advantage of the warranty to begin with (check with Asus I guess to see what your options are far as warranty.. in my case I knew after four years it was unlikely my tablet would still be under warranty).\n\nI also noticed I had to charge my tablet overnight (as in leave it plugged in for  about 8 or 9 hours or so with the tablet turned off) before my tablet figured out that it had a new battery in it and showed a 100 percent charge.. after that however worked great, charged up without any problem at all !"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "This was my first tablet, purchased at the suggestion of my son, who repairs all brands of cellphones and tablets for a living. He felt that this was the best \"bang for the buck\" I would find; more reliable and stable than some much more expensive tablets. I purchased a \"factory refurb\" a month ago and was indeed very pleased with it. I attempted to purchase a second factory refurb for my wife, but two in a row, from different vendors, arrived DOA; even with a full charge, they could be started only when plugged in - the result of a bad bios update, according so some forums. In any case, even though they were \"refurbed\", it was obvious that nobody had tested them to see if they would actually start! The vendors were not to blame; both (including Focus) promptly sent call tags and refunded my payment in full with no questions. I finally received another ASUS Tf101 which, like the first, works perfectly.\n\nMy second unit came in the original box with all the literature, and looked like new. But the literature is perfunctory and of very little use; not a problem if you're already an Android phone user, but my wife uses an iPhone so some hand-holding was required.\n\nAn additional issue with this purchase is that Amazon's posting says, \"Asus Transformer Tf101 10.1-inch Tablet (Dock Included)\". There was NO dock included for most of the offers under this headline, which was easy to deduce by reading the product information. But Amazon should make sure their posting headline matches the product!"}

I like the fact that it looks super expensive and yet at an affordable price.  It is in fact, quite fast for an old Tablet.  Just like my former Toshiba Thrive,  it has a dual core speed,  However,  it seems a little faster than the Thrive.  I just want to add one very important thing.  Make sure whenever you purchase this Tablet, that it has and ADOBE FLASH PLAYER downloaded into the system.  This one did not and I had to really go find someone to help me out.  I was able to download the Flash Player through the Dolphin browser.  For some people to have or not to have a Flash Player makes no difference.  HOWER, be aware that some video sites will not open without the Adobe Flash Player.  These are some of the sites you will not be able to enjoy without a Flash Player....C/SPAN Washington Journal,  CNN VIDEOS, FOX NEWS VIDEOS, PBS VIDEOS including the NEWS HOUR Show....I am sure there might be others out there off limits without the Flash Player.  However, if it does not have a Flash Player, you will still be able to watch HULU, NETFLIX, and YOUTUBE.  If that is all the matters to you, than don't worry about the Flash Player.  But if you want a more complete  experience on the net....Yes,  I think you will want the Flash Player downloaded in your Tablet.  So, make sure when ordering your Tablet to know for sure that it does have the Adobe Flash Player, otherwise it can still be done like I did through the Dolphin browser, but not an easy thing to do if you like me are not a tech genius.  If this Tablet came already with a Flash Player....I would have given it 5 stars...."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I did not buy on amazon originally, got as a gift for my birthday. I've been using it since just before they updated the OS to the new one. I've been using it everyday, mostly for apps, and pdf reading for school, but this tablet has gone through a lot.\n\nEven after the several times I've dropped it(it has a roo case on but still, probably should try to never drop any sort of techy gadget), the countless app games I've played on it, the frequent skype calls, the times where I've slept on it(don't sleep on your electronics often, pro tip), and the occasional YouTube video, this thing has lasted. Apparently, this thing charges faster than the iPad I heard, and even after a few years it doesn't take long for my tablet to get a 3rd or half of its battery refilled.\n\nThe only cons I see is sometimes I feel the processor isn't totally powerful for some apps, but that's mostly due to the apps poor coding. Somehow, I've managed to short out the charger 2 times, but it was fixed by me waiting awhile, and then my tablet was able to charge again. On that note, I've not had yet to replace the charger either, but I've heard of some people that had to, but there's also fixes like taking the charger part off of the base of it, and then reattaching it to \"reset\" it in a way. Another minor note is I kinda suspect my tablet's battery to need charging more often, but I can't tell since I've been using more gaming apps more and more often. In the beginning, I barely used the tablet and it would last quite a while if left untouched because I didn't do anything with it  other than just leaving it on.\n\nI recommend asus' tablets, but it's probably best to choose a later version of the transformer, as the newest ones have better processors and stuff. I can't really say for their quality, or other tablets that had pixel and other graphics problems, but for my experience their first tablet worked for me."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "At first,  all was well.  I have been an Android user for a while and am familiar with it.  I bought the dock with it as well, but sold it after 3 months because it was awkward and uncomfortable to use.  It has been 2+ years, and I am about to throw the tablet down the basement stairs.  The power button stopped working after 6 months.  You can turn it off with it,  but you can't turn it on.  That has to be done by plugging in the power supply and plugging it into the wall.  Once on,  you have to leave it on otherwise you have to go through that whole scenario again.\n\nThere are no longer system updates for this tablet. There is no support for this tablet.  \"It is outdated,  sorry\".\n\nNow,  even after a reset,  it locks up,  most apps force close on a regular basis.  The speakers do nothing except emit a high pitched shriek when the volume is on at any level.  Mind you,  it has not been abused.  Never wet, dropped or damaged.  Stays in its leather cover,  in fact.\n\nThe biggest negative. ..  We are Chromecast users,  and because the tablet is seen as a mobile device,  the only two things you can cast to the TV are Crackle and YouTube,  both of which freeze up at regular intervals.  Chrome does not allow casting from this device.  I have done all updates,  every time they say this has been resolved.  Nothing.\n\nI like that it is portable.  But if it dies and there is no outlet around,  it is nothing more than a glorified paper weight.  Forget about taking it on an airplane.  It never makes the trip.\n\nOverall,  disappointed.  It was great for a while but it just doesn't hold up."}

At first I thought the performance was pretty smooth with occasional lag when typing. But with continued use the lag began to feel a lot more noticeable especially when using web browsers and I eventually ended up rooting it and installing a custom ROM on it which allowed me to change various interface features and also overclock the CPU from 1Ghz to 1.7Ghz. It took me a couple of hours to go through the process but I highly recommend going through with it because it would greatly improve your experience with this product. It won't impair it in anyway including the Keyboard functionality nor would it prohibit you from making purchases from Google Play.

Until I saw this Asus trans. on Amazon, read all the positive reviews and it's cheaper (not a lot) I bought the whole set with keyboard.  I was happy at first, but since my friend have an iPad, I can see the big diff..  Then the on/off button start playing tricks on me after a month, I called the manufacturer and they want me to send it for a repair, I didn't, I found out how to do the tricks. The keyboard is useless, I barely use it, it's so heavy, the apps are limited. After almost 2 years while showing my portfolio to my clients the screen stop responding all the time, it's very embarrassing.  I paid almost $700 for the whole set, and I felt being stock on it, until my husband gave me an iPad-air for my birthday, and it was such a relief. My Asus trans. is now somewhere in the corner of our house collecting dust!  I'm a computer savvy,  and I learned not to be cheap, just go for the best!!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Overall, this has been a solid tablet over the past two years for basic usage (television apps such as WatchESPN and HBO Go, the Kindle app, and various games).  To be fair, it performed best when I first got it and it was still running Android 3 (HoneyComb).  After the upgrade to Android 4 (ICS), there were a number of various lockups and freezes.  I was able to get past that by removing most all apps (and selectively re-installing only the ones needed) and performing a cold boot.\n\nThe primary positives of the tablet are that it has very good quality video (at least when watching television); seems to have an excellent wireless card (I have less trouble streaming video to it versus an iPad); and an aesthetically designed chassis.\n\nOn the downside, the battery life is exceedingly poor. I find that I have to re-charge it far more frequently than the original iPad that I also have (which is also a year older).  Additionally, as mentioned, although the hardware is more than capable of running Android 4, the version that ASUS rolled out was far from perfect.  In late 2013, this unit certainly doesn't compare against many newer models (from ASUS or other manufacturers), but for a good price, it's an average, but solid, tablet."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I purchased this tablet along with the keyboard docking station for a cost of more than $500 just over two years ago.  Suddenly, it would not turn on even though the battery was fully charged.  I contacted customer service, and they instructed me to hold the power on button and the volume down at the same time for 25 seconds or so to do a reset (there is no reset button) ..... but nothing happened.  This unit has NEVER been dropped or abused in any way. Because of the exceptional care it received, I decided to wait about a month before sending this in for repair (they said it would be about $75 minimum to fix it) and after trying many times, I was able to get it up and running again.  But the fix lasted only about a week or so and then once again, I am unable to turn it on.  After going to Google and searching the internet for this problem I have discovered this is a very HUGE and common problem.  Whoops!  Looks like Asus has a defective product  but they are unwilling to do anything about it except to change you a lot of money to either replace the motherboard or whatever.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice?  Nope, I will never, ever purchase another Asus product period.  Buyer beware!  I am not sure what I am going to do with this unit, maybe in 30 days I can get it working again.  I am writing this review on a 10 year old lenova laptop that I have used a lot, and the only thing that has ever gone bad was a battery which cost less that $15 to replace.  I will get another tablet because I like the battery life and the ease of carrying it with me, but I will really do my homework before I buy another.  Failure after a year or two with gentle use is not acceptable to me.  Any questions?  I will be happy to answer them.  Thanks for reading this post.\n12/3/2013. UPDATE:  After trying for days (weeks) I was able to get the tablet to boot up again.  Although I have tried many times using the \"hold the power on button and the volume down button at the same time for 20-30 seconds to do a reboot, it never worked.  Today I did it again, with the keyboard dock attached and also pushed a pin into the reset hole between the headset jack and the hdmi attachment and between pushing lots of things it rebooted.  I went into the tools at once and reset the tablet to factory specs which erased every thing I had done, including all apps I had downloaded.  As of now, it is working.  I will keep you up to date.  Thanks for reading this post. 12/27/13. Update. I finally got this to start, not quite sure how but immediately reset this tablet to factory settings and after two weeks is still working fine. Go figure. Still, I am very fearful of this brand and will not buy another unless I am convinced newer models will not fail like this one did.\n,"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Our son purchased an Asus Transformer 32gig tablet. He is in the Air Force stationed in Germany (currently stationed in Afghanistan). He purchased it online, it arrived in Germany D.O.A. It would not power up at all. He asked us if we could send it in for him to get fixed on warranty, we said sure, send it to us, we'd gladly take care of it. This was in January. We received the pad in March. I called Asus about getting it repaired and spent alot of time with tech support. The first person I talked to took all the information and said it could be fixed under warranty, all he needed was the email that our son ordered it under to verify his identity. Since it was a different address than he uses to communicate with us, I contacted our son in Germany to get that email address, and called tech support again. This time I spoke with a different representative who, after alot of time on the phone, informed me it couldn't be fixed under warranty. She said it didn't matter where it was shipped from or whether or not it was D.O.A., we'd have to pay full price plus shipping and insurance to get it fixed. Since we don't know what the cost would be, we put it away, it's never worked, we're stuck with a non-working expensive tablet (with nice leather cover that our son bought with the tablet...) that we don't know what to do with. It was a lesson learned for our son, who lost several hundred dollars on this deal. The help and cooperation we received from Asus was, shall we say, not good. I doubt our son would buy another tablet from Asus. I know I wouldn't."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "If you trust my words at all, know that these tablets are appalling.\n\nPerformance: performed well for about 5 months before a faulty software update (and this is an official update, mind) started to slowly cook its guts; photo gallery will not work anymore, can't pause videos on Youtube, it's stopped recognizing its own charger, and it randomly crashes, and I do mean randomly: sometimes when I have a bunch of very taxing apps open, sometimes when I am closing same said apps to give it a breather, and sometimes from the mere act of bringing it out of sleep mode. Nothing fixes it; a factory reset doesn't work, trying to update to a newer firmware doesn't work, calling tech support got me a recommendation to do either of those things before they declared that I \"must not be doing it right\" and to send it in. It is currently being fixed at ASUS headquarters in Grapevine. Which leads me to...\n\nProduct support: Haphazard. Tech support reps for ASUS don't often seem very knowledgeable. One of the times I called, the rep took my RMA number and put me on hold to \"pull up [your] account\" for nearly 10 minutes; this has not happened before or since, I called back immediately after and there wasn't even a pause after they took my RMA number. Each call is WILDLY different in procedure and length (coming from someone who also does tech support, this is something that should NOT be happening) and usually of zero help.\n\nBattery life: Laughable. I am constantly plugging this monster in, something like 6-8 times a day, because it seems like every time I turn around it's almost dead. That \"9.5 hours\" you're reading? A hideous lie. It gives you MAYBE 3, if you're lucky, during use. Only problem with that is, as mentioned above, an official software update fried its brains and it's stopped recognizing when its charger is plugged in, meaning I have to trick it. Not to mention the charging cable is maybe 1.5 feet long, so if you're getting this crazy idea of USING your tablet while it charges, well, you're gonna be crouching next to a power outlet for a while.\n\nWell, I'm rambling now, so I'll wrap up: don't buy this. If you're considering buying it because you've heard it's powerful, avoid it, all it does is drain its own battery. Maybe I just got a faulty unit, judging by all these other favorable reviews, but after my experience I won't be giving it another chance."}

After upgrading, the tablet spontaneously reboots, crashes, force closes, and the battery drains even when plugged in. Software updates from ASUS seemed to make the problem worse rather than better. An entire month went by when I couldn't use the tablet because of poor software quality.\n\nThis tablet simply is not reliable enough to be a primary device. It's become an expensive spare tablet. I hate to throw it away but I really can't justify investing any more money in it to fix the hardware problems or any more time to sort out the other issues.\n\nIn my experience, the quality of the Transformer tablet is very poor compared to the other ASUS products I own such as motherboards and graphics cards. Perhaps ASUS has improved its tablet quality with later Transformer models. If so, I would recommend buying one of those and staying away from the TF101."}

I've used it mainly for web browsing, chat, email and games.  I've very few issues with it.  First issue was with the keyboard attachment with it's track pad, but figured out how to disable the track pad and fixed that issue.  The second issue was one instance where I was not able to turn on my screen and it went completely black.  Was able to fix that issue with holding the power button for about 30 seconds.  Otherwise I've had no issues with it and am very pleased with this purchase!  I'd recommend this to anyone looking to do some casual tablet using! :D"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I loved the ASUS EEE pad transformer tablet...while it lasted! It was kinda big but this only enhanced my Netflix and other video viewing. The app store is great- I even got an app that seems no longer to be available in the app store not even for other EEE pad users (something called SuperNote with a really cool \"Paint\" note option) and I kinda really liked that app - so sad I cannot get it again!\n I figured out how to customise my screens eventually with trial and error (there was not much documentation) and downloaded a bunch of apps for the kids in my house to practice learning stuff - very few actual games - although in the last month before it gave out, I did get one of the building games. It had both a rear and front facing camera which worked decently enough and the device never gave much trouble except the few times it seemed to reboot itself for no reason. But I'm used to PCs giving similar issues so I never really gave that \"defect\" much thought as it never really affected my day-to-day use of the thing.\nFor 9 months I started to think ASUS was the best brand ever and was considering buying a laptop in that brand. After 9 months and now more than a year later, I'm completely disillusioned and completely without a working EEE pad! It's not even a glorified paper-weight because I wouldn't want to use it as that, so it just sits in my room while I contemplate exactly what I can do to get it working again. Since it first \"conked out\" within the 1 year warranty period, I was able to send it for service and when it came back, I was happy for a few days, as it seemed to be working fine. I had not gotten around to reloading my apps yet and then it again started exhibiting the same symptoms that caused me to send it for service, so it's as if I wasted money shipping it out to get the service done on it. The symptom: it continually reboots itself once connected to a power source, or once it has any remnant of power in it. Sometimes it will stay on for like 10 seconds (giving me false hope) and then reboot but usually the reboot will happen almost instantaneously. So I liked it for a while and now I hate it because it doesn't work! Maybe I got the one in a million dud, but I sure feel duped. Something this expensive should at least last more than 2 years before it blows. I take small comfort in the fact I never purchased the dock for it. I so wanted to like ASUS for this, but clearly something is not right. I have a Nexus now and it's ok, but why oh why does anyone make a portable device like this and not include: expandable storage via micro sd slot and both front and rear-facing cameras...who does that? Want to know who: ASUS apparently! But that's another review!"}

Too long for a single page, but too \"short\" when held sideways to properly display 2 pages side by side.\n\nThe touch input is not precise(?) (does not have a fine enough resolution) to allow handwriting input.\n\nAs a note pad as well the display is actually a little too small. I'm still waiting for a tablet that has a display area at least as large as a standard sheet of paper. (8.5\" x 11\") which would be a 13.9\" display.\n\nThe display for an android device is finally large enough to support apps running inside of windows. But android seems like it won't support this sort of display for quite awhile still\n\nPros:\nIt's thin,\nit's a tablet that can be connected to a keyboard\nbattery life ONLY with the keyboard is decent\n\nCons:\nthe keyboard has to be purchased separately\nbattery life without the keyboard is so so\nthe included charging cable is far too short\nThe power adapter is unreliable (AC to USB 5vDC)\nThe display aspect ratio is only worthwhile when viewing video with that ratio\nCould have been thinner except for the style of the design\nthey keyboard is completely useless when not connected to the tablet. It should have been connectable via a cable or via bluetooth when disconnected\nThe display is too small - 10.1\" is still too small for decent textbook reading or web browsing\nFor a tablet this size it need to support an accurate/precise enough stylus accept handwriting as input\nScreen realestate wasted by the button/status bar for the sake of onscreen buttons that are provided by the keyboard (this is more of an android 3.x issue)"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Have had this table with dock for almost a year. I was very excited when I first got it, but it quickly began to dissappoint, most notably the dreadful ability (or inability) it has to connect to networks.  It takes so long for pages to load, it reminds me of being on dial-up, and when I'm surfing, I'm constantly getting messages that say \"browser is not responding\" (this is with having nearly full bars).  Another peeve I just thought of while typing this has to do with the keyboard dock: the screenlock button is right above the backspace key, so for someone like me who isn't always looking at the keyboard, hitting the screen lock accidentally happens with annoying frequency, forcing you to enter your unlock code to continue your work.  On to the wi-fi/customer service issues. Apparently the geniuses at ASUS finally realized that their latest and greatest had some issues, so they offered their customers a dongle (really?) So the dongle would actually connect to the tablet in the same place where the keyboard docks, which means in order to use the dongle and boost connectivity, you would have to forgo the use of the keyboard (really?)Seemed like a stupid idea to me, so I suffered on without the dongle until finally I couldn't take it any longer.  I called customer service (really tough finding the right number), and explained the problem which of course they are fully aware of.  The CS rep proceeded to tell me that they were offering the dongle free of charge only for a limited time, and too bad for me that the shipped had sailed on that one.  I was stunned not only by the stupidity of their \"fix\", but that they would attempt to charge me to fix a problem that shouldn't be a problem!  I calmly told him that both my husband and 14 year old son will be in the market for new computer devices and to guess which brand we WON'T be choosing.  The guy had the audacity to say: \"With the other devices, you won't need a dongle.\" I SHOULDN'T NEED A DONGLE FOR THIS DEVICE AND I MOST CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR IT!! The very idea that while I was experiencing dissatisfcation with an existing product, this joker tries to upsell me on something else without trying to resolve my issue was beyond infuriating. Right now, I am researching tablets for my husband....guess which brand I won't be considering?"}

I bought it so that when I conduct communications coaching sessions I could video record the client and then offer an instant critique.  It worked beautifully and still does.  Both the video and audio quality were excellent even when attached to a projector for display on a large screen.  And ... the unit has enough hard drive to allow for seemingly endless recording.\n\nMy only disappointment is that I still had to bring my laptop to be able to play my PowerPoint presentation because while the Asus software will play PowerPoint it will not play the animation.  All it will do is switch from slide to slide and my slide show includes not only animation but imbedded video as well.\n\nI also bought the keyboard which is fine but I wound up using it for a stand in order to position the camera.  The key pad is far too small for my big fingers and the touch pad is super sensitive.  The big pro with the keypad, though, is that it offers additional battery power when attached to the pad itself.  I ran it for 12 hours on a charge and it had plenty in reserve.  I also like the other functions of the Asus transformer especially the fact that there is a USB port an HDMI port and an external speaker jack and those are the real reasons I bought it.  I don't know anything about the I-Pad so I'm no judge but I can't imagine it can do much more than the Asus.\n\nI had one minor incident with it.  Somehow the corner of it got stepped on and the glass covering the screen has 3 cracks in it.  But the cracks are invisible when its on and operation isn't affected so I'm a happy camper."}

I had to wait for a replacement. The store I bought it from told me a month to wait for their warranty, Asus told me 2 because of back orders. That told me that they were having major issues with the chargers. After raising a bit of heck I had a replacement in a week. Three months later it happened again. Same deal with the back ordering and the waiting. Four months later it happened a third time. Not happy, but what can you do? At least I had the warranty.\n\nOther issues cropped up in that time. I had touch sensitivity issues to the point where I finally broke down and bought the docking station. The docking station had it's own problems, but I'm not reviewing that so I'll let them go. About 6 months into owning the tablet the volume buttons on the side stopped working. I put off complaining about it, and figured I'd take one trip to the store I bought it at towards the end of my coverage to deal with anything that may or may not have come up.\n\nSo, last month, December, a month before my coverage was up, I brought it to the store and told them about my issues.\n\nTouch screen was all but gone for about 45% of the time. Volume buttons didn't work, apps were crashing like Lindsay Lohan, the charger issue came back for a fourth time, the GPS couldn't hold a signal to save it's life. Bleh.\n\nThe store's solution put a smile on my face. Apparently at least one of my complaints was enough to warrant giving me a brand new tablet, (telling me that at least one of my complaints was a widespread one that they had already decided was enough to scrap the old models). I was assured by the associate, trained specifically to help these issue, (call him part of a \"Nerd Brigade\" to not call out a store by name) that the replacement tablet would work on my original docking station. I didn't believe him, and had good reason to. So now I'm out the docking station, and have to repay full price for one because Asus put a sub par product on the market to beat competitors in a race.\n\nI liked the tablet. I like Asus. I don't like the situation I'm in because of them though. My replacement (newer model if you couldn't tell) so far seems awesome, but with the replacement being necessary because of Asus's design flaws, (nobody can deny it was their own fault I needed a new one) I would expect some kind of discount on the dock for the people in my situation at the very least."}

I was super excited to use my new tablet, but after 8hrs of charging in a functional outlet (I tried 3 different ones!) it still refused to turn on. I reluctantly wrapped my Transformer up in it's original packaging, and went online to find the return address.  The return address label did not come in the original packaging(!!??).  Usually they give me a sticky return label, but the seller did not provide this.  I contacted Amazon.com and chatted with someone. After much prodding, they gave me a physical address I could actually write on the box, as I do not have a functional printer available at home. I stress the words \"much prodding\"... After a couple weeks, my package was confirmed delivered, and my money credited back to my account. I ordered another Transformer that same day, and when I received it (almost a month after the original order date) it turned right on. I am on week 2 of having my Transformer. I like it for the most part. One thing I've noticed is that when I am on Facebook and try to \"like\" or \"comment\" on someone's status/picture/etc., it takes a long time for the screen to recognize what I am trying to do. I often get frustrated and continue scrolling, but by the time the screen catches up to me, I am long gone. It then does this bouncy scroll screen thing where it goes back and fourth on it's own for several seconds. I guess I will just not use my Transformer to comment on Facebook.  All in all, it was a good purchase. The apps I've downloaded work nicely, and it has lots of internal memory. I have no intention of using it as a PC for typing or storing data and only plan on using it for surfing the 'net, taking videos and pictures, or using the Kindle app on it, so it works for me. Maybe if given the choice and money weren't involved, I would have ordered an iPad, but it is definitely worth saving over $200 for a product that basically has the same function."}

As a matter of fact I've began to use it as my end all to be all notebook.\nI've found myself using it more than my laptop and at times my desktop for something quick.\n\nAs they say all good things come to and end. Trouble in paradise... problems start occurring.\nThe first one, when I've accidentally let the battery run dead. It took at least two to three days on a consistent charge before I could even boot into the thing to use it.\n\nSecond problem occurred over the summer on a trip to NYC. It was dead before I ever took off from the ground. I had to carried this thing just about the entire trip (it was useless), it would not boot up, and there wasn't any reason as to why.\nSo I've sent it back to the Asuck, I mean ASUS and to their credit in about a month time they've sent me back my tab with a new android system. I think ICS 4.0...\nWell I don't have to tell you all my files were wiped. ;-( So I had to start from scratch.\n\nThe third problem, three month into using my tab after it came back from ASUS support, get this.. This thing won't display the screen. It will boot, I will see the ASUS logo, and the spinning dots but I won't see nothing else after that, I mean WTF?\n\nWell I'm done, it doesn't make any sense sending it back waiting another month just to get it back and from some unexplained reason the tab goes belly up again. The product is unstable.\n\nListen folks, word to the wise if you're in the market for a tab leave this one alone. ASUS haven't done a good job with this product, and they don't really stand behind it either and for the money they're asking for it, well its ridiculous.\nGood luck!\n- d"}

I bought it for school - I started an online university that uses lots of flash resources and all of the forums I read said to try this because the ipad does not support all we need and it's nice to hook up the keyboard when its time to write a paper. Frankly, I was a tad skeptical. I have an android phone and love it for the most part but just had a hunch that nothing would rival ipad. I can't say enough good things about it! It's so customizable like my phone is. I have everything I need - most primarily full flash support. I understand that 4.1 jelly bean will kill that so I plan on ignoring any updates if they come. ICS is plenty good enough for me - which it automatically updated to right out of the box.  It's a little heavy and thick - most tablets of this generation are in my opinion. So far, I'd say that I'm really impressed with ASUS quality and would consider buying the newest Transformer over the newest ipad in the future. I'm converted, err... \"transformed\". ;)"}

I am IT professional who knows his way around these gadgets and yet I am  beyond frustrated.  I bought this 1 year ago today and in that time I could have saved enough money to buy an iPad or a Samsung which are both head and shoulders above this tablet.  I bought this because of the price point and not wanting to spend $600+ for what really amounts to a tech-toy...EPIC mistake.\n\nCons:  Internet browser closes randomly since day one.  Upgrade to ICS turned this into a paper weight for 3 months while ASUS finally sent out enough firmware updates to fix all the problems.  Kudos to ASUS for their tenacity.  Typing on dock is no joy if you are used to a real keyboard, mouse pad continually moves cursor while typing, there is no delete key that I can find (get used to using the backspace), touchscreen is sporadic at best.  Many Android apps are not compatible with this hardware.  Many websites don't display properly, for example...instead of having 7 or 8 items shown horizontally, it will line them all up on the left in two columns  for pages and pages.  Wireless response is slower that iPad (tested between this tablet and wife's iPad).\n\nPros:  Sadly I cannot think of one thing positive to say about this tablet.  Save your money and buy something you'll be happy with.

I've been researching a lot of different android tablets and for the price / performance this one really attracted a broke college student like myself. My main uses for the tablet are drawing, note taking, and internet browsing aside from the occasional app here and there. So far it's been doing it's job fairly well and although the OS doesn't feel as \"smooth\" as the iPads the extra features of Android really make up for it especially if you're an open source kinda guy like me. Widgets are pretty cool although I don't use them as much but still it allows you to personalize your tablet the way you want it which is a big plus. Because of the ips display this tablet carries some apps which aren't optimized for this resolution can seem very pixelated or just stretched out but a lot more developers seem to be starting to fix that it tends to be smaller ones which haven't yet. With that said I'd take an IPS display over a lower res LED display any day of the week. Some cons are build quality isn't the finest thing in the world but not the worst either. While it does feel like a high quality device it seems like the way it was pieced together was half assed. For someone like me who tends to be very ocd about the little things it was a negative to this tablet but for someone who's not looking for every little small issue won't notice it. While it might seem that I'm mainly pointing out the negatives I do love this tablet and would purchase it again, I'm just trying to be helpful to those who want to know what they're buying. My guess is if you're looking at this product you know what's great about it already. Overall it's a very solid tablet and compared to other android tablets at this price range and bellow it seems to be the obvious choice, stock android, SD CARD SLOT!! (stop it with all this low memory / cloud nonsense it's not cutting it yet), beautiful display, and awesome battery life.

Secondly, the connector pins that bridge the gap between the prongs and what is commonly called the \"brick\" bend easily thereby completely breaking the circuit so it no longer charges the tablet. I don't even understand why they come as two separate pieces. And lastly the cable is connected to the brick via a USB plug and after little more then one year the insulation around the USB plug has started cracking and is falling off exposing the wiring. No doubt because the aforementioned overheating problem is drying out the rubber making it brittle. I can't believe this thing ever passed quality control. It'll either burn you or electrocute you one day. What kills me is that anyone at ASUS would have only needed to plug this thing in for like 10 minutes to notice how hot it gets.

While it is a tablet and does what any table can do, if your son drops it on the floor and dents the power button, be prepared to suffer the consequences and use small hard objects to push in the power button forever until it turns on and off.  I take full responsibility and don't blame asus for that, but for your information...even if it has a case on it, it can still get damaged.  I tried getting a hold of asus, which you have to in order to fix it since nobody can service the thing.  I waited weeks before getting a response from them and they didn't even give me an estimate so I decided shipping it off in hopes of it getting fixed was something I'd put off until I just couldn't handle it anymore.  I was unsure since I had read several reviews about them not being able to fix similar problems the first time.  I got the tablet because I wanted a tablet and I wanted a laptop.  The dock is useful and it's nice having the extra battery life and keyboard, but I have found the cursor skips around sometimes in the middle of typing words. No, my hand is not touching the mouse pad.  Anyway, the most annoying thing is that I can't do everything I had hoped to do with it.  I still need a regular computer since some web pages always come up mobile and you can only change to desktop format on some of them.  I can't send mass emails from contact groups and the flash only works half the time on any browser. Oh, and the charger stops working if it's plugged in too long.  I ordered another cable because I thought it didn't work, but it does the same thing.  Apps are better on the hubby's ipad and if he has a problem ever, he can take it directly to an apple place instead of having to blindly ship it somewhere far far away.  I suppose I'll again look into fixing it and maybe it will be less annoying to use, but I guess I'm just more of a desktop person and will leave the tablet for going out and playing games."}

The built quality is very sub-par with the casing of the tablet already loose. Also the screen could have used a resolution bump but thats been fixed with the Prime. Other than that the tablet functions great. Or should I say funtionED. Yesterday as I was doing a little reading on my tablet it automatically shut off and started back up. I didn't think anything of it because it was a common problem. Well once it got past the boot logo a message came up on the screen that said \"Encryption Unsuccessful\" and it said my tablet needed a factory reset and all data would be wiped. I had the 32 GB version with 4GB of free space. I go to show somebody else and then the screen cut off and never came back on. It has been a full day since and nothing will get the screen back on (dock, wall charger, or computer). I loved this tablet for my reading, textbooks, and netflix and now it is a $400 paperweight. So please be warned that there is a possible - albeit small - chance that you might lose everything on your tablet and never recover it again.\n\nEDIT: After dealing with customer service I was able to use my warranty and get the item fixed and shipped back at no cost. They even waived the usual shipping costs (probably because they know it was their fault). Of course all data was gone off of it like it had to do a factory reset. After a couple of months I decided to switch to the new iPad because I do not want to take the risk of losing everything again.\n\nP.S. The charger also stopped working and after searching online I found a fix for it. I would have left the review at 4 stars but after ANOTHER problem its at a 3 max."}

My thought was that she could use it instead of junk up the laptop with food and kill it with viruses from odd websites. It worked good for just that and occasionally I would use it for transferring pictures from my desktop pc and carrying the transformer for showing portfolio pictures to my clients. It worked ok for that as well except for occassionally getting to a meeting and the transformer wouldn't power on with a full battery. Asus tech support couldn't help much other than say I downloaded something that is causing it to do that. Then one day I called Asus tech support waay before the 1 year warranty was up and they said the won't help with support unless I buy a plan so they can assist me. After around 20 hard resets and maybe 7 factory resets now the unit is completely dead and i am now 8 days out of my 1 year warranty. I paid somewhere around $350 for this transformer. With what I know now and the trouble associated with this unit, I will definitely be buying an Ipad. Losing out on quality and craftsmanship was a bad mistake.

What is really annoying is that you cannot charge the pad without the docking station.  In other words, this is not a pad, it is a net book that you can detach for temporary use as a pad.  A pad, would indicate that it could be used independently of the keyboard, and though this can be used, for the length of the battery, it cannot ever be charged unless on the dock.  A truly annoying \"feature\" dreamed up by people who want you carrying the dock around everywhere you go. As a matter of business theory, if the dock is required to charge the pad, why is it sold separately?\n\nPlus the tech support people are just rude, constantly interrupting and refusing to accept that their product isn't perfect.

It's increasingly frustrating. The first time, it was a charger issue. It took 3+ weeks to get it back and $20 in shipping on our part. The second time (today) it won't turn on at all. We've tried everything and it doesn't do anything.\n\nI called Tech Support and while calmly expressing my frustration, was hung up on by the CSR. The second time I called back, I was able to talk to someone who would listen but there was a major delay between my talking and his. A good 3-8 seconds. Sometimes so much that I thought I had been hung up on and would say \"Hello?\" Weird. This whole thing has been frustrating, customer service is little help.\n\nAll of that to say that we are generally pleased with this tablet, despite some forced and unexplained shutdowns. It's pretty quick and it has worked (ha) well for us.\n\nConsider Apple a little harder. I wish we would have.\n\nUPDATE: 8/1/2012 - I had asked to speak to a manager when I called in previously. The CSR told me that a supervisor was unavailable (likely) but that he would take my name and number and I would be called back by a manager. I fully expected not to hear from anyone. A couple of days went by and I was finally called by a manager. After telling him my story, he allowed a \"one-time courtesy\" of sending me a shipping label. So the shipping cost was picked up by Asus, which was nice. Haven't received the tablet back yet. Will update on how it works when we get it back. Happy we didn't have to pay for shipping.\n\nUPDATE #2: 10/8/2012 - Guess what broke - AGAIN!?! I'm so done with this company and it's lousy product. Now, when we turn it on, we get the back light but nothing else happens. I'm DREADING calling customer service. It's official that I will NEVER buy from this company again. I changed my review to ONE STAR after trying to find their customer support number and none of the web pages worked that contained that information. Trying to hide your phone number from customers - figures.\n\nUPDATE #3: 5/3/2013 - Some good, some bad, and some ugly. . .Our tablet broke yet again. I'm not even a little surprised. Since our one year warranty is up, I was still hoping to plead our case for just getting the whole device replaced with a new one - it's obvious we got a lemon. After being in contact with Tien, the CSR who commented on this, he says he can't put in a request for a new one (for some reason) but to call Asus and they will probably do it. NOPE. Figures. I will NEVER EVER EVER again consider buying an Asus product. This has been a horrible experience and this tablet is a piece of JUNK. Oh, I said there was some good...the only good news is that they will repair it for me. Haha. Look for me to update again in another 4 months about how it broke again. UGH."}

I had been using a family members Ipad for a couple of weeks and liked it, but I was interested in trying out an android tablet instead (mostly because they are flash enabled and cheaper).  I did a ton of research and finally decided on this product.  I was really suprised when I opened the package and saw how big this tablet was!  It was a couple of inches longer than the Ipad, and I know that doesn't sound like much but it really makes a difference!  It started up fine and the setup was fairly easy.  However, once I stated using the browser I noticed how much slower the internet browsing experience was compared to the Ipad, and there was a very noticable lag when typing in online forums.  Another annoying thing is the lack of built in spell checker that the Ipad has (this is a really helpful tool with the Ipad, it makes writing a lot easier and there isn't a lag between what you type and when it appears in text box).  I was also annoyed that the tablet kept updating itself and then restarting.  This isn't a bad tablet, but I just enjoyed the ipad experience a lot more.

It is very quick, I can multitask, the wi-fi is excellent, the screen is very responsive, and i have not had a single freeze up on it. The cameras are easy to use and very, very nice! I downloaded some great apps from the Google Play market and can do a billion different things on here. The speakers aren't too bad, but obviously not stereo quality. That is my only complaint, if you could call it that, but honestly in my opinion built-in speakers are usually not great on any device.\n\nMy husband likes it so much that he is planning on getting one for himself (good, i have hardly put the thing down since i got it and don't want to share!). It takes us some time to buy a new device and I can tell you it was worth the wait. Very pleased with this device and I'm sure I will find a million new ways to use it!  I really like the operating system and it was easy for me to figure out since it basically was a larger, better version of my Android based smartphone. Yay ASUS!!"}

I naively thought I could just contact Asus and get a new charger. Instead, it has been a frustrating series of emails and phone calls and being put on hold for long periods of time and being told to contact someone else and start the process over with them.\n\nOther than this issue the tablet seems to work pretty well. Written instructions and the tutorial provided are minimal so it has been a big guessing game figuring out what icons mean and how to get things done.\n\nI read some other revues about poor customer service before I bought the unit but decided to take my chances and go ahead anyway. I should have known better. No matter how good the product, why would anyone do business with a company that places so little value on standing behind it's products?"}

However, problems arose once I \"upgraded\" to the new Android 4 operating system, a.k.a.: \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" (ICS).\n\nMy experience is not unique or isolated.  If you do some research on xda-developers.com, you'll find numerous reports of random reboots, units freezing on the ASUS splash screen, WiFi disconnects, and more.  It is unclear at this point whether these issues are attributable to ASUS, Nvidia or Google, but several attempts to fix the issues have had limited success.\n\nPROS:\n- Excellent battery life, especially with the keyboard dock, which includes an extra battery.\n- Responsive capacitive touch screen.\n- Runs Adobe Flash.\n- Multiple storage options - MicroSD card slot on the tablet, and if you buy the keyboard dock, an SD card slot and USB ports for flash drives.\n- Lighweight, even with the keyboard dock.\n\nCONS:\n- Flawed ICS firmware (at this point).\n- Very poor tech support from ASUS.\n- Running on ICS, if the unit has a random reboot, then gets stuck on the ASUS splash screen, it will drain the battery in pretty short order.  (This happened to me, and it drained the fully-charged battery overnight.)\n- \"Universal\" tablet cases won't fit, due to the TF101's unique dimensions.  There are cases out there, but I only found one that would work with the keyboard dock. (Search for \" ASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101 Leather KeyBoard Docking Station Portfolio Stand Case Cover\" by Minisuit)\n- Sound volume is quite weak with Honeycomb, but improved with ICS."}

I love the convenience and the ease of checking multiple email accounts and my calendar and since I've gone mobile I rarely use my All-in-one.  However, the annoyances are getting to me.\nThe tablet will shut itself off at random times even when the battery is well charged (others seem to have this issue if you check the Transformer forums).  The included My Library app has never worked, but fortunately Polaris Office can open PDFs.  Facebook's app was also problematic so I use the highly rated Dolphin browser but that usually crashes several times a day.  Other apps such as Rhapsody also are balky on occasion.  Is Android a problem for developers? Am I just having bad luck? I don't really know.\nI hope that Android updates may eventually fix the annoyances but I'm starting to see weird display artifacts like the ones that preceded the demise of the first Transformer.  If the tablet bricks again I may abandon my religious convictions and head to the local *pple store where I can talk face to face with a \"genius\".\n6/9/2012 Update (also see my comment on the original post).  This unit did brick again.  After several back-and-forth emails with Asus support (who were fairly prompt but had no solution) I received a return authorization ticket and the tablet is on its way to Texas.  I don't know whether a new tablet or a repaired one will come back to me but I will sell or give it away.  I paid $466.53 before tax for the Asus but I can get a 16GB iPad2 for $399.00 now. If I have a problem there is an Apple store 4.6 miles from my house.  I really wanted to like this Android product but I'm really disappointed."}

I initially purchased an Archos 101g9 from Microcenter and noticed that it would hang and reboot intermittently no matter what app I was using.  I returned the first unit after doing a total reset on it and still had the hanging and reboot issue .  After the second unit had identical issues and working with Archos tech support only resulted in repeated questions from them with no resolution, I returned the second unit and got a full refund.  While still at Microcenter I took a look at other tablets and saw that for $10 more I could purchase this unit.  I had read some reviews about this unit and it was rated highly so I figured why not give it a try.  I am very impressed with this unit.  For starters it has not frozen once (I have ice cream sandwich installed) and having the alpha and numeric characters usable on the keyboard without switching screens was a big plus.  Network connectivity was an issue on the Archos also but I have this unit running on my home N network and have not experienced any lost connectivity. I also purchased the keyboard which extends the battery life (advertised at total 16 hours).  The keyboard definitely sets this unit apart from other tablets due to the built in battery, integrated touchpad, two full sized USB plugs, SD card reader, and it fits perfectly.  I'm just waiting for my case now and need to figure out how to print and I think i will be giving my laptop a long rest :-).  By the way I paid $299 for this at Microcenter.  Great unit and sweet deal .  The only negative I have is that the trackpad is very sensitive so I do sometimes hit it by mistake while typing and it  moves the cursor somewhere on the page where I was typing but that is more user error on my part and I just need to keep my fat fingers away from it when typing"}

I am able with a single charge to play 2 hour game and stream\n  movies for 5 hours from netflix.  I was waiting for the battery to perform less after 8 months but\n  it is still performing the same.\n4) A full recharge is taking nearly 1:00h to 1:30h\n5) The CPU power is excellent (no issue with any games in the adroide store )\n6) Streaming and video viewing is excellent\n  (nearly as good as some video from the ipad depending on the quality of the files and if\n  hardware acceleration is available)\n7) The price is very good for the quality of the product and the return value that you can get from it.\n8) No need to use itune  and a lot of sofware available in the adroide store\n\nThe CONS for the ASUS :\n\n1) The charger provided don't have the quality needed for the tablet. I will recommend to buy\n  immediatly an voltage ajustable charger after buying. The one provided is getting hot\n  if used frequently.  My last kid was playing (during charging) and after 12 hours it stop\n  working.  Bought a new votage adjustable charger and no issue like this even if the tablet\n  is video streaming 16 hours.\n\n2) The tablet is using 15V as input. All other equipement has a standard of 5V then you absolutly\n  need ASUS charger of an adjustable charger. This was a suprise for me.\n\n3) I have upgraded to ice cream version and I found that this version is less stable the previous version.\n  I am having now \"force clausing\" once a day.  what I did not have with the previous version.\n\n4) The tablet is coming with a US firmware version or other Zone related version.  This is used to block\n  some applications or fonctionality.\n\nI love this tablet and I want to get one for my kids . ASUS will need to convince me to buy the new version\nsince I am feeling very confortable with this one.\n\nThe 3G/4G service can also be an issue for some people but  In my case I am using the 3G network on my phone\nif I am moving with the tabl"}

I love the screen, the ease of copying files into an SD card whether it's music, video or pictures, and the fact that I can surf anywhere there is a wifi hotspot. I don't have a Kindle but I downloaded a Kindle reader app which works the same for the ebooks. The Transformer has a built in reader that reads those generic pdf files that the Kindle app can't open. I'm not terribly into tablet games but I do have AirControl and Spaghetti&Marshmallows to play when I get tired of reading and surfing. I can watch videos and listen to music and I like the fact that it's so easy to change whatever is in my SD card. No USB port on the tablet itself (I hear it's on the dock) so either I remove the SD card or I turn on bluetooth. Then I go to File Manager and copy/paste as I please, just like in a PC. I haven't tried the Cloud thing yet coz I don't like putting my stuff on a virtual server but I will one of these days. I'm the type to turn off auto syncing too, btw. I like to do things myself.\n\nAnyway, I actually went out of my way to write this coz I noticed the product specs says it comes with Honeycomb. It does. But it can be updated to ICS. One day I got a notice that I had an  Asus update and when I did,  voila, Ice Cream Sandwich.\n\nBrowser got better. Less closures and if it does close with multiple tabs open it will offer to restore those tabs for you. With Honeycomb I had to look for my tabs in the history before I could restore them.\n\nMy only serious complaint is I can't watch vids taken by my Kodak digital camera (which I transferred to my SD card) using the built in video player. But then, I found an app (player) for that so still ok. Oh, and the camera is fine but is grainy. Good enough for Skype but not great for pictures or video.  The camera on my Nexus One is better. Heck, my husband's Sony Ericsson Mini Pro's camera has macro. Takes great pictures but can't update firmware past Froyo."}

The on/off button has been touchy since the get-go....just thought it was \"normal.\"\nAbout a month back, I tried to turn the tablet on and couldn't. I had to use an object to \"help\" press the on/off button to get it to turn on. Also can't get the tablet to turn off as the switch is so sensitive, it puts the tablet to sleep whenever you can get the button to work.\nSearched Google and found this is a very common problem with this tablet. So, I contact ASUS RMA service and have been trapped in foreign CS hell for weeks now! They need the serial number....fine....WHERE IS IT???? I find the number under settings, send it to the CS rep. A week goes by....I get an email stating the serial is wrong, to send the correct number. I look all over the ^%@$%@# tablet - NOTHING. I finally find the instruction manual - Alas! Another - DIFFERENT - serial number. I send it along....wait several days....and receive an RMA from ASUS....only, the return instructions state that if the serial number isn't physically on the product, the warranty is void?!? WHAT???\nSo, now I am - once again - waiting for a response from these people about WHERE the serial number is supposed to be located on the tablet and WHY the serial number on the manual doesn't match what's under the \"settings\" tab on the tablet!!\nTo me, it seems like an excuse to get out of warranty coverage!!! And, after the run-around, I'm supposed to feel confident in sending my tablet - which cost hundreds - off into the sunset to these people?!?!?\nOther than the sucky customer service at ASUS, the tablet has been okay at best. We ended up buying an Ipad several months back - which blows the TF101 out of the water.\nGiven the obvious issue's with the on/off button (search Google) and the lack of customer service, I'd say this is my first and LAST ASUS purchase. Go for the IPAD - skip the TF101 unless you're \"in\" to taking gambles..."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "have now used this tablet for almost 1 month. I am not a journalist or evaluator of electronic devices (borrowed for short period). I am just a normal user who uses it daily for myself. I do not own any other tablet but have a colleague who uses an iPad, with which I can compare.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAfter one week of use, I found myself loving it. After two weeks, I was loving it even more. And after almost 1 month, I cannot live without. I recommend it highly to everyone.\n\nWHY NOT APPLE'S IPAD\n\nI am an Apple fan. I have been a Mac user for last 10 years. I bought at least 2 iPods in the past. And I currently use iPhone 4S. So naturally I liked iPad when my colleague showed me one.\n\nThen why I did not buy Apple's tablet (iPad)? That's because I am an iPhone user! More and more I learned about iPad, it became clear to me that it is a \"big iPhone without phone\". I already have most of the features of iPad in my iPhone.\n\nIn other words, If I buy an iPad, I gain little while paying twice for the same things. But If I buy an android tablet, my selection of features and apps gets doubled, as I gain an access to Android Market in addition to Apple's App store.\n\nThis was one of decisive reasons why I chose ASUS Tablet over Apple's iPad.\n\nWHAT I LIKE\n\nA. Superb Design - Beautifully design with a GREAT shaped body is a winner.\n\nI found that its physical design is not just gorgeous but significantly useful.\n\n(1) When holding it on your hand, it feels lighter than flat type because the center of gravity is closer to your holding hand.\n(This is true even when holding it horizontally with both hands if you hold the upper half of the device. And it feels secure because the wedge shape on upper side works as a slip-stopper.)\n\n(2) It is much safer and easier to carry it around room to room without fear of dropping it\n\n(3) The screen is easier to view with less glare, and its virtual keyboard is easier to type when placed on the desk. You do not need a special carrier case to do that like all other flat shaped tablets.\n\n(4) This is the only tablet that you can gently put on the desk and comfortably pick it up without fear of dropping it because the wedge shape with hollowed sides gives you a convenient handle to hold it securely.\n\nASUS is the first company that realized that thiner is not necessarily better. Thiner and flatter the device, the more difficult to gently put it on a hard surface of desk because your fingers are not on the sides but underneath, and you have to pull your fingers from beneath at some point. And thiner and flatter the device, the more difficult it is to pick up. (Just imagine about picking up an unbending flat thin plastic plate from a desk!)\n\n(5) It is simply gorgeous to look at both when held in hand and placed on the desktop (you don't need ugly case to elevate the upper side).\n\nB. Light Weight - Use of special plastics make this tablet light and strong.\n\n(1) This tablet is lightest among all tablets in its size-class. It is essential for mobile device to be light. Lighter the better; therefore, it is the best in its class in this regard.\n\nC. Large Storage Capacity (External SD card and USB drive)\n\n(1) I bought one with 16GB. I also bought a 32GB external SD card. Together, my Tablet has 48GB at all times. That's plenty for many videos and movies and other data. (Compare with Kindle Fire which has only 8GB)\n\n(2) In addition, with a USB connector ($17), I can also connect to my 1 TB USB pocket drive if I need it. (iPad does not have USB connector.)\n\nD. High Quality Camera and Video Recorder and Crisp Video Replay\nOne of the things that my friends envy about my ASUS Tablet is quality of pictures and videos it can record. You take video in front of them and replay immediately in beautiful resolution. And watch their reaction :). It's fun.\n\nE. Wide Screen\nUnlike iPad or iPad-wannabe tablets, ASUS Tablet has a wider screen. That gives ASUS Tablet at least two major advantages. First, it is much more suitable as a movie viewer. If you intend to use tablet for movie viewing, this is an important consideration. Second, it gives THE Tablet a comfortable space for a virtual keyboard that includes numeric keypad, just like a normal keyboard. I really hate iPad virtual keyboard because I have to keep switching in order to type a number. Another good thing resulted from ASUS not followling Apple."}

With the addition of the docking keyboard that has USB connectivity I have yet to find any basic computing functions that I am not able to perform versus my laptop and with the android market (now called google play) you can find many applications to fit your needs. It comes pre-loaded with Polaris Office which allows you to manage all your files and folders and create MS Office compatible documents (97-2003 powerpoint, word and excel). It also comes pre-loaded with the kindle app for downloading any of the kindle books from Amazon. The EEE Pad allows you to web browse, chat on FB, listen to music and watch videos with ease. Setting up email is painless and I even have my AKO email set up. If you are unfamiliar with Android there are many great applications for whatever your needs are. Android also uses desktop widgets so you can quickly view weather, chat messages, tasks and calendar events and many other things right from the desktop. There is also a menu button that let's you switch quickly back and and forth between any of the applications you have open.\n\nThe tablet itself is quite snappy and responsive and multi-touch works well. The screen is very good, crisp, clean text and images, colors look great and it has wide viewing angles. It is however prone to glare. The rear facing 5 MP camera takes good photos and while the front facing camera photos are only ok it is more than adequate for video chatting. Audio quality is good and it's plenty loud.\n\nI am very satisfied with this purchase. Since I have a powerful desktop computer and with all of the features and functionality I get with this tablet I do not see the need to buy another windows based laptop. The Eee pad is perfect for everything I need and is lighter and more portable than a laptop. Add to that the fact that the battery life is outstanding (even more so with the additional keyboard dock) and you have a fantastic mobile computing device. As you will find in online reviews, this  is one of the best android tablets out there (pretty much hands down the best in it's price range) and is the perfect alternative to the Ipad2.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I bought this tablet in September of 2011 and have been using it as my primary computing device ever since. It is a perfect blend of portability and functionality. I only fire up my PC for those few things that a tablet can't do.\n\nOn its own, the tablet has a lot to offer, especially at its current price point. The Tegra 2 processor is no slouch, even if it is outclassed by the new Tegra 3. It runs really smoothly, especially with the latest update to Android 4.0.\n\nI was worried about the plastic back housing before I bought it, and was surprised to find that it feels pretty nice, and keeps the tablet from feeling too heavy. It certainly does not seem to have hurt the tablet's durability. I accidentally left my TF101 on the roof of my car, in a flimsy little soft case, and it flew off at 40 mph. It hit the asphalt pretty hard, but other than minor asthetic damage, it was unharmed. I am sure that it could have been damaged worse, had it not been in a case at all, or had it fallen at another angle, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well it held up.\n\nSome people have complained about the wide bezel on the front, but I actually prefer it. Having that much room means you can grip the tablet firmly without accidentally activating the touch screen.\n\nASUS has been really good about updating this device as well. They seem to be conscious of customer complaints, and address them with firmware updates to fix bugs, and they are always one of the first companies to update when a new version of Android is released. This is probably largely due to the fact that ASUS doesn't make many modifications to the stock operating system. What few they do make can only be described as improvements.\n\nThere are some nice apps and services that ASUS includes with the TF101 as well. SuperNote has quickly become my favorite note taking app when using a stylus. It is designed to combine handwriting, typeface, and drawings all into the same note, seamlessly. Polaris Office is one of the best office suites available for Android, and you can only get it with your ASUS device. Additionally, ASUS has app backup, cloud storage and desktop streaming services available with trial periods.\n\nWhere the Transformer really shines, though, is when it is paired with the optional keyboard dock. The dock is what solidified the TF101 as my primary device. With the extended battery life, full size USB and SD card slots, mouse trackpad and chicklet style keyboard, there is very little that I can't get done on my tablet faster and easier than I could on a PC. With desktop streaming and services like Onlive Desktop available, there is even less that I can't do on the TF101 vs my PC.\n\nThe only reason I gave this tablet 4 stars rather than 5 is because it is not THE BEST tablet available right now. If you want the best, then look at the Tegra 3 devices. If you want a solid tablet, with great support from the manufacturer, a good pricepoint and the option of turning it into an Android powered netbook, then look no further than the ASUS Transformer TF101.\n\nThis review was written from my TF101 with optional keyboard dock."}

I also got a bluetooth keyboard in lieu of the more expensive dock and have been happy with it:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/AmazonBasics-Bluetooth-Keyboard-for-Apple-iPad-iPhone-Black/dp/B005EOWBKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">AmazonBasics Bluetooth Keyboard for Apple iPad, iPhone (Black)</a>.\n\n3. Responsiveness. There's been a lot of complaining post-ICS for this device, but after a few cache clears and following some directions on XDA to speed up the device, I haven't had any problems. ICS is snappy on the TF101 and I was really happy to have the device receive the update as early as it did. I haven't felt the need to root the device at all (unlike with my phone).\n\nASUS is now on the 3rd (4th?) iteration of their Android tablet line, so much of this is probably outdated, but if you happen to find one of these for cheap and are looking for a smooth Android experience, I can't recommend it enough. It's wonderful for typed notes in class and great as a travel tool too--the IPS display really shines with HD video."}

It's really not that bad. Until it starts powering off randomly.

I call customer service again and basically the same thing is happening. I have to ship it back. Half the time I have had this tablet, it has been at \"customer service\".

Running Android 3.1, there was no lag, all the applications ran smoothly, and I had complete compatibility with all the applications I wanted to run. After the update to the latest version of Android, the tablet randomly restarts, the sound cuts out entirely until a manual reboot, and most of my applications hang or encounter problems which force them to close. Sometimes the homescreen itself locks up and requires a reboot. The update occurred recently, so I am outside of Amazon's return period. ASUS won't offer a solution since \"It isn't broken\". They did tell me to do a factory reset, but that did not fix the problem."}

I love the fact that you can buy a 16gb model and YES a 64gb microSD card WILL WORK. I have tried it myself and it took  me a while, BUT you I formatted it in my droidx, that was the only way I got it to work. Overall, I am very happy with this device! The dock is a must have because I can go 3-5 days with out charging either as long as I don't watch videos a lot haha Oh, and the microSD card slot does not fit the card very well, it sticks out slightly, but again, not a big deal, it will not fall out."}

But then came the not so happy experience that may happen with any electronic equipment: Even though Asus advertises it as having an ''9,5 hours'' battery, the most I was getting with no GPS or Wi-Fi activated was 5 hours which really annoyed me, then came two problems with the screen: First was the back light-bleeding in three spots in the lower portion of it which also was annoying especially when watching videos and to end the experience with majesty, a dead pixel appeared!! And then it was enough and I had it returned and god an Acer Iconia and I'm loving its screen: The quality was as good as the Asus but no backlight-bleeding at all. When the background is dark, it looks like the screen is turned off! I had never seen such a good level of black. At the moment there's no update available to ICS but my experience with it in the Asus was not good as it slowed down the performance badly and if the delay bring estability I'll be patient and happy to wait.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "In my business I have gone through 5 different tablets to fulfill the communications needs of my staff.\n\nFirst was a IPad--an okay tablet but it fought all my non-apple devices, took over my computer, etc.  If you're not fully Apple, the IPad freaks out, fails to hold up with routers, etc.  Second was a Nook Tablet--great tablet, few available apps.  The B&N mail client was really lame when considering the tablet's capabilities.  (The Kindle Fire is a bit less of a machine but has lots of apps.)  Barnes and Noble wouldn't let me jail break the Nook either--I would have paid an extra $15 just to be able to go to the Adroid Market.  Now my 7-year old boy plays some games on it.  Next came an Acer Iconia 7-inch A100.  Great little tablet.  7-inch screen was tough to read with using my aged eyes--great screen ...  I just needed bigger tablet or I have to constantly find my glasses (same issue with the Nook--getting older really sucks at times).  Then tried the Acer Iconia A200 with it's 10.1 inch screen.  Worked great, but I'm old school and need tactile feedback when I type or its 20 words a minute if I'm lucky.  And I'm on the email 3 hours a day, with an hour of it on the run.\n\nBut then I saw the ASUS ee Transformer with the dockable keyboard.  It was what the doctor ordered.  I got both the ee transformer Tablet and the docking station and I was amazed at the Android's 3.2 OS speed and the Asus screen clarity, etc.  Who needs aretina display that needs a lot of battery power (the issue with Apple IPad 3 getting a good bit warm--it's the batteries draining).  This Asus tablet kicks some rear end.  Lots of Apps, no gimmicks or real issues.  The memory on the tablet/docking station and the slots for the micro SD (tablet) and SD chip (dock) allow you to go to at least 78GB!  And the battery actually runs 8-ish hours.  And when docked to the keyboard with it's separate internal battery, I took it past 15 before I plugged in to save the batteries.\n\nBTW, (from America's battery experts) Lithium Ion (Lion) batteries are not supposed to be drained like the Ni-Cad and others.  They don't like to be deeply drained.  They can last for 7 to 10 years if you don't cycle them hard (that's why Prius Batteries last that long--the Prius wisely keeps you from deep cycling the batteries).  LIONs wear out a bit every time you deep drain them.  If you deep drain them a lot they lose charging capability over time and last 1 to 2 years (why many laptop batteries die so quickly).  So stay plugged in unless you need to go somewhere and enjoy long Lithium Ion lives.  Note that when the laptop istructs you to drain the battery every so often and then recharge it, this action isn't for the batery's sake--it's so the computer knows how much the charge goes down to and can charge to.  (And so the laptop maker can sell you a $150 new battery every two years.)  Just an FYI.\n\nBack to the Tablet: I've recently received Android 4.03 for the ASUS and its gotten even better.  A bit different, but better. Runs crisper, so to speak.\n\nThe screen of death popped up twice for no reason, but this also did so did on the IPad.  For the Asus, I had to hold the power button for about 14 seconds and it rebooted just fine.  Asus should let everyone know why it passes out every so often.  Both times the tablet was with me at work in a no-signal zone where I can't hook up my hot-spot.  Was it the tablet's attempt to get out to the bigger world and it fainted from the effort?  Was it the honking big transformer sitting 12 feet from my desk putting out EMP noise??  I don't know.  But, I you're like me, just hold the power button to recycle the unit and you're good to go.  All the other great things truly out-weigh this inconvenince.  Nothings perfect, and if I have to hold a button down once a month to stay free of Apple's unjust war with the rest of the non-Apple world, so be it.  As a business man I understand competition, and Apple's got some good stuff, but they should live and let live.  If Apple management eased off on this aspect, people would get to better know the Wizards at Cupertino.\n\nEnough said."}

After reading many reviews, most of them highly favorable for this tablet, I was not disappointed with the tablet when I got my hands on it.\n Pros: The price. Much cheaper than the over-hyped iPad. (No fan of Mac here)\n  Battery length. Running ours even with Google Navigation, will easily go two days without charging.\n  The solid feel of the tablet. The fact you can use SD card for extra storage. The quickness of the OS.\n  The Screen: Color is very good, brightness is good.\n  Sound: When using Google Navigation, and no this is not 3G or 4G tablet. When in area where you get wifi, map out your trip, it will download and then live GPS will take over from there. The sound is lacking, but this is a tablet. When in area where there is no background noise like open card windows or radio, or people the sound is very clear. Videos from youtube and movies play without hiccups and no problem hearing the sound.\n  The Menu buttons are responsive to the touch and overall the tablet responds quickly.\n The Good: I wish ASUS, and I am a big fan of ASUS, had thought out the position of softkeys, like their Application Key. It is in the top right corner and it is very difficult to see, at the very least make the text bigger and even a different color? Something that when you look at the screen you can quickly find the shortcut to all of the applications on your tablet.\n The Settings is also petty hard to come by. The only way I know of accessing the settings is by accessing the Applications and then select Settings. I would think a softkey next to the home icon would be perfect for this, like on my EVO.\n The camera: It is OK. This is the 101 tablet and my understanding is the bigger tablet has the better camera. This comes with a 5 megapixel camera back facing and I think a 3 megapixel front facing camera. The pictures are, OK. I really wish a LED flash would have been used but, it is a tablet. The pictures are pretty good especially in good light, low light not so much.\nVideo is pretty good. I have yet to put it out to my HD tv, but I will when I get the HDMI cable; mini-HDMI port on the side of the ASUS for porting out to HD devices.\nThe tablet is slick to the feel so a gel case was ordered as well.\nFor those that want a solid tablet, one that dare I say rivals the iPad, ASUS does it, it is much cheaper and compared to iPad 2, I think this ASUS, the small version, matches or beats the iPad on almost everything, except for the camera and I will have to be honest the screen quality. Otherwise, this ASUS rivals the iPad2.\nSo save yourself some cash and buy this baby.\nTim"}

Browser performance was spotty with constant force closes on photo or flash heavy web pages. Wifi and Bluetooth radio performance was also below average. I was unable to stream video smoothly at only 20 feet away from my Belkin N router. I contacted ASUS customer service and was assured an Ice Cream Sandwich update would be released in just a few days and to hang tight. They claimed this would fix all my issues. True to their word, an update was soon available. This fixed my browser issues completely. Unfortunately, the tablet started force closing random apps with complete power cycles occurring randomly. I performed a factory reset as advised by their tech support line. The same issues arose. Just a few days after my 30 day return window with Amazon expired, the tablet froze while using the Gmail app. It rebooted to a screen saying, \"Encryption Unsuccessful\" and gave me an option to reset the tablet. Tablet now only power cycles and shows that screen. I have been issued an RMA to have the unit serviced by ASUS. Repair is expected to take \"between 10 and 14 business days in our repair center, plus any shipping time\". It's also worth noting that I have to pay for shipping out of pocket. In combing the interwebs I see many others with similar issues and horror stories. I would rate this tablet 5 stars if the software was solid. The hardware seems great. Epic battery life, beautiful screen, responsive touch input, etc. I'll review my repaired product once it arrives from ASUS service."}

I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews, but wasn't too worried due to Amazon great return policy.\n\nWe saw or experience NONE of the problems reported by many of the reviews, except the power switch was close to the volume control.  The power switch issue is/was a non issue for us.\n\nWe liked the Transformer so much I order one for myself!  I also order the keyboard which most likely won't get used that much, but nice to have available just in case.\n\nI have three desk top computers, a laptop, three printers and two hard drives networked at home.  The transformer logged onto our network quickly (with password) and recognized everything.  It even picked up our Direct TV boxes!  The Transformer is faster then any of my current computers (both processing speed and network speed)which are all fairly new and fast computers.\n\nWe were amazed at the Google voice recognition and search function!  My wife has COPD and the voice recognition had NO problem understanding her.\n\nWe don't have a single negative thing to say or report about this product.  It appears Asus reads the review and comments and takes corrective action, even the power cord appears to be longer then others reported!  There are so many good (and free) apps available for Android systems, when will Apple learn that their product control and priority controls will bite them sooner or later.\n\n3/21/2013 Update - I ended up ordering another Transformer for myself, because my wife was having so much fun with the one I purchased for her.  It works greats and has absolutely NO problems or issues.\n\nI noted that one of the reviews said the Transformer would not run Netflix movies.  Not true, I'm able to enjoy any Netflix movie using the free app.\n\nI'm still finding great, useful and fun free apps!"}

All the ports and expanded storage options are great too.\n\n***However*** the nice looking hard shell gives a false sense of security. If you press on the back of the transformer, the metal covering bows inward. Press harder, and the screen will have permanent bleed (white marks). This is not a problem unless someone accidentally steps on it, even lightly. This was not a problem with my Apple Ipad."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I have two 32g TF101s and they were both upgraded to ICS (Android 4.0.3) without any hitches, like rebooting or power button problems. The power drain is noticeably less, thanks to the optimized ICS that proves more efficient than the previous version. The tabs were stock and unrooted before ICS, the notifications were received and automatically installed upon acceptance. Asus did an excellent job in providing the latest Android OS on the Transformer 101.\n\nAs far as functionality, the TF101 gps locks on within 10 seconds, the wifi signal strength is excellent at 54 mbps with very fast downloads, and the bluetooth now has a built in native pairing for the Playstation 3 sixaxis game pad controller. No root required.\n\nIn addition, the playback of 720p hd movies is extremely smooth and highly detailed with no lag, even from an external hard  drive hooked up through the usb adaptor or the external sd card storage. At 1280x800 res, the screen update is noticeably faster after the ICS update and HD playback on Netflix must be seen to be appreciated, it rocks! Note that a minimum dsl speed of 5 mbps is needed to sustain the high density needed for HD video streams, a high bandwidth that the TF101 handles effortlessly.\n\nThe gaming capability of the Tegra 2 in the TF101 is without a doubt the top notch in performance, any HD game out there will execute with speed and fast response to your touch.\n\nLastly, this tablet's resale value has not waned because of it's excellent performance and quality. While you may be happy with the new quadcore chips in the new tablets, the TF101 still has no match in overall functionality and flawless operation."}

I have a lot of gadgets, an iPad, an Acer W500, a NookColor, a Kindle and have never had any problems with the rest of them, but the build quality and lack of service from Asus is absolutely amazing. I've already ordered a Samsung Tab to replace this, if they can ever fix this it's going to eBay.

I love the fact that with the dock and I can connect a full USB keyboard and wireless mouse. I can even connect a external hard drive if it wanted. HDMI is a great bonus to connect to a tv or computer monitors. I can completely get rid of my dell laptop and use this a standalone PC if I really wanted to. Battery life is awesome! I've taken it on a couple of flights and never had a issue with the battery. I think the next flight I won't even take my charging cables because I always have more then enough for the entire trip and the flight back. The TF101 I have only has the 16GB internal storage but with the MicroSD and standard SD in the dock I have a easy 100+ GB of storage available for use. Some limitation I have ran into is watching movies. Video rendering performance was lacking when running HoneyComb but since the upgrade to Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4) those problems are a thing of a past. ICS has made this already awesome tablet running butter smooth.\n\nOn another note I do support for credit card terminal and found that it supports running card readers (swiper) such as the Magtek Micro USB Reader. So if you are a business owner you can use the same hardware on your computer with your tablet. Its crazy what this tablet can do.\n\nThe only think I do not like about my TF101 is that it takes about a 1-2 mins to start up. Seems a little slow but I can live with that. I highly recommend this tablet!"}

The transformer was not turning on, i tried connecting to a computer,  connected to the wall adapter, but nothing worked. I called the customer care and they tried to cold boot the transformer by asking me to press vol down button and the power button. Since nothing worked they gave me an RMA number and asked me to sent the transformer to their repair facility. I had to spend 15$ for shipping even though the return shipping was free but it took around 14 days for the total repair process. Their customer service is worse, they won't update the status online regularly and if you call then they will say that it will be done in 14 business days not customer friendly at all. After I received my transformer last week my wall charger started not working, again i called Asus support and they asked me to send it for repair again. I had to spend another 4$ for shipping and this time I am not able to view the status online at all. Less than 8 months I have to send it for repair two times.

Of course, the worst thing about the Transformer is the moment of transformation. Connecting the tablet to the keyboard requires a gentle patience that is simply not part of our clunky American culture. I could easily imagine someone bending or breaking the connecting device.\n\nThe system works like a charm, but the machine seems thin and vulnerable (particularly the on/off button, USB input, dock). While I personally find this product to be twice as good as anything else on the market, I would not recommend it for young people, careless people, or people who are clumsy. A single drop to the floor and this perfect dual-product would instantly become a hundred pieces of trash."}

The screen quality is great, it's easy to use, and a few days after I got it ASUS sent out the Ice Cream Sandwich update, which makes a number of small but significant improvements over Honeycomb. The device is very light, and as a result feels slightly unsteady if holding with one hand.\n\nMy only complaint is that the build quality seems to be less than stellar. The plastic back can be a little creaky, but if you get a folio cover (as you should) this isn't really a problem. There is a little bit of lightbleed on the edges, but I didn't even notice until I had set the screen all black and was in a dark room.\n\nOverall, I'd say if you're looking for a solid dual-core android tablet, this would be a good purchase."}

The touchscreen is as responsive as any other tablet on the market. The apps download and open very quickly. I have had some apps Foreclose a couple of times but it was always a game and never the OS. So, that didn't bother me. The sound appears to be great coming from a tablet. It reads and has edited every Microsoft Office document I have opened including Word, excel and powerpoint. It comes with a few widgets already preloaded like weather and such that work good and is accurate. Before I bought this tablet I spent nearly two months reading reviews and comparing between the Asus Transformer, Ipad 2, Samsung Galaxy, HP Touchpad and a few others. I found that the Asus appeared to be just as good if not better than any others on the Android OS but had an advantage with the mini SD card slot, mini HDMI port and the keyboard docking station that the others didn't have. I found that in my opinion it is better than the Ipad because you have the ability to be in more control of the OS which is the way it should be right? I mean its your money you should be able to do what you wish with it. Bottom line is this tablet does so much and is capable of doing anything you would expect from a tablet.

The screen seems to pick up finger prints very easily. Finally, the power charger/data transfer cord has a proprietary connection, not a mini USB. I'm sure this is needed to work best with the dock, but it would be nice to be able to use universal power chargers and USB cords.\n\nThat being said, the HDMI slot and micro USB slot I'm stoked about, though I haven't used them yet. It's nice knowing I have some options for expandability and perhaps used to play videos from on an HDTV. The Android platform and apps have come a long way and there's plenty of Android apps I've been using that are optimized for the larger tablet screen, including some apps I specifically got the tablet for like Kindle, Repligo Reader, Anomaly HD, and more.

The battery life is impressive, I play a Gameboy color Emulator on it, as if it were my job and I can get about 6 hours. That is 6 hours with constant use and the screen brightness at a moderate level. With the docking station I can go almost 2.5 days before I worry and need to charge it. Asus is also standing behiind their customers (or so they have said), and are going to release the update to Ice cream sandwhich (4.0) within the next month. I have not had any serious issues with it.\n\nSo for all the good things I have to say about it there are two complants I have with it.\n1. When typing extensive notes the typing speed gets very very slow. It gets a little overwhelmed and when I am trying to move quickly and keep up in class it gets a little crazy.\n\n2. The second issue is with the charger. Tht bad boy gets HOT. Like it could almost burn you if you aren't paying attention. I've checked around on the internet/looked and friends asus chargers and I've been assured this is normal due to the amount of Amps running though it, but I still worry leaving it to charge while I am not in the room.\n\nOther than those two issues I love this thing. Its versatility I feel, is unparalleled in today's tablets market. I've even had my apple companions envy this little power house. I recommend this to anyone who needs to be productive, but still wants access to fun applications. Best decision."}

I say so becuase I lost multiple package someone stole it. The good thing I have my tablet now. Anyway, I love the product: 1). It's easy to operate self explanatory. 2). It's fast, battery life is very excellent, internet connection's great, the apps are great, I may say better than my I phone apps,. The downside, the TF101 is not thin as TF102. Overall, I love this product. This is my first ASUS tablet. I am happy about this product."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I was very heppy with this product, at least until I needed to contact ASUS customer support.\n\nI have the TF101 tablet purchased in July of 2011, and the docking station/keyboard purchased in October of 2011.  The tablet has been fine, but the docking station has had issues.  The first one that I received was DOA, so I returned it to Amazon.  The second was fine for three months, but then developed a problem where several of the keys have become intermittent.  Note that nothing has been spilled in the keyboard, and there has been no other physical damage.  Moreover, the keyboard has had only very light use.  Bottom line on the hardware is that ASUS knows how to make a good tablet, but has yet to figure out how to make a reliable keyboard.\n\nLast night I called ASUS customer support and explained the problem.  The customer support rep insisted that I reset the firmware back to factory settings, even though it was obvious that there was a hardware problem with the keyboard.  He assured me that I would lose no applications.  I backed up all documents, pictures, music, etc., to the external SD card, and then called back.  Per their instructions I did the reset.  Guess what?  I lost ALL \"Free\" Apps, and there is no way to get them back short of finding and re-installing them.  By the way, the reset had absolutely no effect on the keyboard problem, so now I have a bad keyboard, and I get to spend untold hours re-installing apps, tweaking settings, re-installing data, and who knows what else.  This reset back to factory settings was ABSOLUTELY UNNECESSARY.  To add insult to injury, it will take 2-3 weeks to have the keyboard repaired.\n\nI don't know if Apple's customer support is any better, but at this point, I would sure give them a try!"}

As you can see it is cheaper then an ipad with all the functions more power and of course the android market. I do now have the keyboard but I honestly find it just as easy, if not easier then a regular keyboard . The best thing about it for a college kid the fact that it's got an awesome word program (Polaris Office), that puts it right into Microsoft .doc format. It's light enough to bring every where but powerful enough to run netflix and a bunch of games. Being a college student who is also in student government (therefore in plenty of meetings) I find it very important to be able to write notes but also have the ability to play games, surf the web, and access to the Android Market.\n\nThe last and most important thing is the price, Asus is truly shoving in the face of Apple that they can make a product that is cheaper and better. Usually I say you get what you pay for in this case you still do! A tablet with this much power (Nvidia tegra 2) and running top of the line platforms (Android Honeycomb 3.2) should not cost any more. Just because Apple (Ipad) and Samsung (Galaxy Tab) over price does not mean they are better.\n\nAlso if you are looking for even more power I suggest going with the Asus Transformer prime which runs on a quad-core processor."}

I didn't want a laptop or just a tablet but both and this fits the slot perfectly! well done Asus. My Transformer is fast to respond and holds so much stuff! and with the docking keyboard the tablet battery life is extended beyond my expectations! and is very quick to recharge. So far I have had no problems at all (touch wood) and yes I would recommend these items to anyone wanting just that little bit more for less.\nI have watched Netflix movies with no lag and great picture quality and e.mail is a breeze, games play perfectly,both the tablet and the keyboard are neat, light and great looking. I downloaded the Duel Battery Widget which shows me the charge in both tablet and keyboeard dock on screen so i always know the battery life in both.\nThe keyboard dock charges up the tablet when connected should the tablet run out of juice and that alone is just great!.The tablet is very easy to detatch from the keyboard but very secure once docked.\nGreat product and price....5 stars to Asus."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Pros: Stock Android with no annoying user interface additions, timely updates.\n\nCons: Flimsy back cover, speakers, front and back camera sucks!\n\nWorst of all is Asus customer service! god forbid you ever need them. Pretty much once you buy this thing and the two weeks Amazon return window is over, you are on your own! Cheers to all those who got the CID/OOW (customer induced damage /out of warranty) and received a repair quotation of almost more than what the tablet cost after two weeks of sending it in out of pocket. My advice, if it breaks down try to repair it yourself. If you can't, sell it for parts on ebay or just throw it away.\n\nUpdate: Beware that the cost of repairing the glass alone(even if everything is still working normally like LCD and the touch Digitizer) would cost you $199 Parts + $65 Labor + $10 Ground shipping = $274 minimum. You could find a new tablet that costs around $350.\n\nUpdate (3/28/2012): Repairs department lost my tablet. They shipped it to a wrong customer. When I checked the tracking number I found the reference number matches my RMA number, but it was sent to a different address. When I contacted them, they admitted the mix up. I am still waiting to hear from them. It has been more than a month since i shipped it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Pros: Good graphix, apps are easy to install, touch scrolling is smooth.  Very good camera, fast processor.  The setup to access documents is very easy.  Reading the documents is very easy and they show up very clear.  It does take them a minute to focus (more like 1 full second) once you show the next page but it's doable.  The back light is very clear.  You can add and remove apps very easily (not the same as shutting down).  The browser is pretty solid.  The battery life is great.  You can encrypt the tablet so you need 2 passwords to open up the tablet.  If you are security conscious, then it's a very nice feature to have.  You can setup the tablet so that you can access a personal email (if you have one) and check it from your desktop.  There are tons of free apps for work, education, etc that are compatible with this version of android for this tablet.  This was one of the biggest reasons for me to NOT go to the ipad.\n\nCONS: Some of the apps are hard to shut down.  I installed the talking tom and talking tom2 and they have trouble shutting down.  The screen gets smudged very easily.  For my tastes, it uses about a 3rd of the RAM on normal without any active apps.  The charger is a bit problematic.  The first charge charged the tablet (with the dock attached) after the 8 hours. However, further charges are slow with the charger plugged into an outlet and can be problematic.  My chrager actually got very very hot and stopped charging.  The solution to this is to take the USB charging cable and plug it into your computer.  Their USB-AC adapter seems to need some work. The worst about this product is not actually the product itself: it's ASUS' tech support.  I sent them an email 5 days ago requesting information on the product and I still haven't heard back.\n\nOverall, this is a very good tablet.  People have complained in the past about the screen being hard to see.  You can adjust the brightness very easily.  As for the smudging, you will want to keep a lens cleaner or glasses cleaning cloth near it.  to avoid all smudging I'd get a stylus.  I tried using the one that came with my sony e-reader but that didn't work.  getting the keyboard is definitely worth it.  The background isn't my favorite.  To change your background, just get the Mulitpicturelive app from the marketplace.android.com (I think).  It's a FREE app which will let you setup anything as the background.  This app allows you to set different backgrounds for the different screens (5 different screens you can slide to).  It's very very handy to download a few apps (task killer, easy task killer etc) all free to be able to shut down apps.  Creating folders to store documents is very easy.  cut, copy and pasting documents is simple.  I would recommend that you BRIEFLY look at the manual just so you know what does what on the tablet.  Then to learn how to use it, just use it and try everything out.  Do this BEFORE you download/install any documents (in case you mess up).  You can put different apps on different screens. For example, all of my office products and basic windows tools are on my main screen (open office, polaris office, browser, task killer, settings, calendar.  On another screen I have reference documents/apps.  On a 3rd screen, I have fun applications like the talking tom.  This tablet comes with some nifty apps as well.\n\nThe only reason I gave it a 4 is because this tablet does not fully utilize all of the RAM from the getgo.  It says it has 1GB of RAM but the process manager shows only 728MB.  Normal computer RAM is 1024MB.  This doesn't come close."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I received an Asus tablet for Christmas.  It came wrapped in a pretty bow and by all appearances, it was up to standards.  The tablet came with no instruction manual, so I have been navigating through it myself.  I am two steps away from being a computer nerd, so I didn't think this would be much of a challenge.  As time has passed, however, I am realizing that I may have to buy an instruction manual.  I just now figured out it is called the Transformer, as the name did not come on the box.  The tablet is aesthetically pleasing and fun, but it is not exactly user friendly.\n The first thing to take note of is that it has the option of becoming a notebook.  You can purchase a \"full size\" keyboard for about $200.  It snaps on to the tablet and then opens and closes just like a laptop.  This panel is slightly smaller than the average, as it is in proportion with the tablet.\n The screen is big--approximately ten inches.  Aside from its vivid color, an important quality is heat sensitivity.  This means that when you touch it, it responds to the heat of your finger, not the pressure.  Another note about reaction is its time.  It has fast reflexes.  There is no stalling or waiting with this tablet.  I was pleasantly surprised by this as most Android devices stall for an extended amount of time. The tablet is hooked up to the Android Market, which is comparable to Apple's App Store.  I am hesitant to download any applications.  I am scared this might slow the tablet down.  I have an Android phone and as soon as I downloaded the Twitter application it started acting sluggish and turning off sporadically.  Consequently, I fear the apps.\n A huge plus is the battery life.  This tablet will last about 12 hours with full use.  That means I can take it to school and use it in every class.  After classes, I can study with it in Starbucks for a few hours.  After studying, I can take it to the gym and watch an episode of Modern Family while I do my cardio.  And at the end of the night, even though it still has some battery life left, I just plug it in and start over the next day.  Although this situation is hypothetical, it is totally possible.  I don't use it in every class because I don't really need to.  I do study with it in Starbucks. Occasionally, when I want to be entertained instead of zoning out, I will bring it to the gym with me.\n I like is its portability.  It is so lightweight and small that it easily fits in my book bag with my forty pounds of books. I am the tiniest bit concerned that it might get squashed from the sheer weight of it all, so I am thinking about investing in a case for it.  The tablet is about the length of a piece of paper; however, it is not as wide.  It is about a half inch thick and weighs approximately three pounds.\n A big issue I am having is with the sound.  It randomly goes in and out.  I read online that a lot of people with this model have had the same issue.  Apparently, it has to do with the headphone jack.  The tablet for some reason thinks that the headphones are plugged in when they are not.  I have taken to plugging in my headphones and taking them out very slowly so as to trick the tablet into playing sound out loud and sometimes that works.  The only way to fix this issue is to take it into an Asus store, which I won't be getting around to anytime soon because I live in southern Indiana.  Additionally, the speakers face the wrong way so the sound comes out all garbled.  I found step by step instructions online on how to open the tablet and turn them around, but I am more than a little nervous to do that.  The next issue I am having is that I can't figure out how to avoid the screen timing out.  If you don't touch it for about 30 seconds, it goes black.  If you are watching a video or listening to music when the screen times out, the sound will stop and the video will freeze.  To prevent this, I touch the screen every couple of seconds.  I realize this is comical, but I am really trying!\n All in all- if this thing came with a manual, it would be great.  It is handy and fast.  Its color and graphics are bright and crisp.  It has fantastic battery life and has the capability to become more of a laptop than a tablet with its optional keyboard. It is a cheaper alternative to an Ipad, but the fact that Apple stores are more accessible than Asus stores will come back to haunt you. . If you live near an Asus store, I recommend this tablet.  If you live in the middle of nowhere, like me, don't take the chance! It's more hassle than it's worth."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I received the Transformer 16GB tab on Wednesday Feb. 1st. It literally took less than 5 minutes to set up. I just chose English as my language and gave it my Google account info and away it went. It started downloading all the apps from the market that I had on my Droid X. I only have about 20 apps but I was really impressed with how easy it was to set up.\n\nNo issues with WiFi or Bluetooth like the Transformer Prime. It streams NetFlix nicely and I'm getting a 15 foot Mediabridge mini HDMI to HDMI cable (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MSZBS0) so I can connect the tablet to my HD TVs in the house. That will be a lot of fun.\n\nDesign:\n-------\nIn the winter, my hands get very dry. So no matter whether the back was plastic or high polished aluminum it would still be a little slippery for me. I like the rounded plastic back with the little honeycomb-like grooves. Makes it easier to grip in my opinion. The tablet itself is light and fits nicely in my hands, and should fit nicely into your hands as well. The Gorilla Glass makes the front of the tablet almost indestructible. Gorilla Glass is very important to have for a tablet. It's virtually scratch-proof and can take a beating. Think about all the tapping a tablet takes over the course of a few months. You can actually drop a handful of change or screws on Gorilla Glass and it won't damage it!\n\nScreen Resolution & Brightness:\n-------------------------------\nI compared the brightness of the Transformer screen to my wife's iPad 2 and she mentioned it's much brighter. She was in the middle of Hanging With Friends so I didn't want to bug her and make her see if the iPad has an auto brightness setting like the Transformer. The difference wasn't night and day, but we could see the Transformer clearly had a brighter display than the iPad.\n\nSpeed or \"Snappiness\":\n----------------------\nFor those reviews I've read about the iPad or Samsung Galaxy being more \"snappy\" than the Transformer, I'm not sure how they came to that conclusion. The only difference I see in speed is when I move icons. The iPad seems to be a bit faster. But scrolling through screens, apps, browsing, streaming, etc. you will see that the Transformer flies through these things (like turning pages of a book).\n\nExtras:\n-------\nI like the stock browser. It uses tabbed browsing which is nice. I would highly recommend downloading the Dolphin Browser (HD). It rocks!\n\nWidgets (stock and for installed apps)...the widgets on the Transformer are very useful and are great for customizing your home screens. For example, I have the Gmail, YouTube, Twitter, and Location/Weather widgets on my default home screen. On the first home screen to the right I have all my entertainment widgets (Pandora, Spotify, Music, mSpot, etc.). The possibilities are practically endless.\n\nWiFi signal - I used the WiFi Analyzer app and was consistently in the -60 to -50 dBm range while streaming Season 1 of The Walking Dead on NetFlix. All this while I'm at the farthest point from the router in my house (the master bedroom). The router is in the basement and I have a decent sized home (2,200 sq. feet).\n\nI have not used Bluetooth.\n\nGPS works fine.\n\nI can't wait to get the dock with this. It will come in handy as a laptop and just as something to hold the tablet up when I'm watching movies or YouTube.\n\nThat's all I can think of for now. I'll try to update this review as I use the Transformer.\n\nUpdate: 2/8/2012\n----------------\nThe YouTube widget stopped working yesterday...bummer. I don't thinks it's an issue with the tablet though.\nI played The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Twilight, Breaking Dawn: Part 1 using the mini HDMI to HDMI cable into my TV. I used MX Player and the movies played great and looked great on both the TV and Transformer."}

Mine came with Android 3.2 (Honeycomb) loaded and last month's announcement from Asus that this model will get Ice Cream Sandwich this month, means that although it has been replaced by its faster brother Transformer Prime, there is still plenty of life left in it.

However, the speakers could have been a bit louder. Low speaker volume is a problem when there is a tv or music player in the room. Also, skype video for this device came out really late which was a problem about a month ago, but thankfully not anymore. Skype video chatting works fine now."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I have had two transformers, both of which quit working after about 3 months. In each instance, at around the third month, it spontaneously quit \"waking up\" when I hit the power button.  No matter how long I hold the button down, alone or in various combinations with the up/down button, it still does not work.  When I researched this problem on the internet, it appeared to be a common problem related to a poor connection between the tablet and the battery.  This leaves the user with only two choices, try to fix the problem yourself and void the warranty or send it back to Asus for repair. Neither is an acceptable choice for a product that is supposed to withstand routine use on a daily basis.  While I will this one repaired, I will not be purchasing another Transformer absent some explanation from ASUS as to how they are going to avoid this problem in the future.  Please note neither of my tablets have been dropped."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Having owned the product for about 6 months I am a little less enthusiastic now. The power button has started to fail and requires more and more force to trigger on/off. You can turn on and off after a few attempts but any reset requiring prolonged press is a real problem. Searching Google for \"asus transformer power button\" shows that I am one of many facing this problem. Those who have been brave enough to take the bezel apart mention that the power button looks like a pretty cheap piece of plastic that easily gets out of alignment. The product is good while it works, but is really frustrating when you need to use the power button. What a place to scrimp and what a way to destroy a potentially great product!! I have contacted Asus by email which per the website is responded to in 48 hours. However 6 days later the status of my inquiry still shows as \"This mail didn't reply yet\": whatever that's supposed to mean! No point sending it in even if it is still under warranty, as replacing with the same button will just postpone my misery by a few months, if at all that long. Being a happy Droid X user, should have gone with the Xoom. At least they have good power buttons. Certainly would not buy (again) or recommend the product."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Bought two of these at 2am \"Black Friday.\"  Mine (with the keyboard dock) has replaced my laptop for traveling and is everything the \"netbooks\" should have been a couple of years ago.  Since many of the pros and cons have been covered in other reviews, here are some of the points not mentioned elsewhere:\nICE CREAM SANDWICH (future support):  ASUS has finished updating the new Android OS and it is at Google getting approval with likely OTA update in mid February 2012.  This is a big deal.  Many Android devices become obsolete when their manufacturers fail to keep their software updated.  This keeps this product on the cutting edge for at least one more year.\nBattery Life:  My wife / kids Transformer never gets put on a charger.  They use it and leave it.  When cleaning the house, I'll throw it on the charger.  Never seen it more than 50% discharged even after hours of surfing, e book reading and Angry Birds.  With my dock, mine goes over 13 hours.  I can go on business trips without a charger, no worries.\nApps:  Android is better supported by developers than I could have ever imagined and many apps are less expensive than they are for the iPad.  One product I use is $3,000+ yearly in paper form, $195 iPad, $4.95 a month on Android (and I like the Android version a lot better).\nSpeed:  The aforementioned charting a weather app (Avilution)pushes an Android device pretty hard.  The Transformer does just fine.  Video and program loading is very quick and plays without stutters.\nSignal Reception:  GPS is quick and gets a lock even in buildings.  The WiFi is fine.  Better than phones can usually suck down and slightly better than my HP laptop.\n\nCONS:  The only complaint I have is that with the keyboard the keyboard is sluggish.  You will probably be able to type just as fact using Android's keyboard on the screen.  Ice Cream Sandwich (aka Android 4.0 is supposed to fix this)"}

I use the docking station and it effortlessly transforms into a netbook. Battery lasts forever, especially if use the docking. Bluetooth, USB works fine. Really a great product.\n\nBUT, the browser on it is just awful. It messes up the webpages most of the time, freezes for no reason often, shuts itself off randomly. Really crappy piece of software. I hope they stabilize it and update it. It's just such a major frustration to have this great piece of equipment and then have this god-awful software on it.\n\nOverall 5 stars for the tablet, 1 star for the software, 3 stars total."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I purchased this product on Black Friday 2011 for about $250, which is still $100 or more less than most places list.  I have been very please w/its performance.  I read some of the other reviews that described early lifetime failures of the touch screen, etc. but I haven't experienced any of those.  I'm guessing Asus has resolved those issues in 2011.  Now after having owned and used it for over 2 months I can write a more informed review.\n\nPros:\n1) Excellent display quality\n2) Nice responsive touch screen\n3) High quality/robust construction (doesn't feel cheap in your hands)\n4) Awesome HDMI connectivity to big screen TV for watching movies\n5) Excellent price ever at $389\n6) Video conferencing works great (have used Google Talk & Skype successfully).  The ability to switch from the front facing to rear facing cameras is very cool since you can show others what you are looking at and give virtual tours of your surroundings at the touch of a button.\n7) All secondary functions work as they should (Bluetooth, WiFi, GPS, SD card slot, HDMI port\n8) All the basic apps I loaded worked great on it as expected.\n\nCons\n1) Slightly heavy, but I'd rather it be heavy and solid feeling rather than light and cheap feeling\n2) Difficult finding a protective case.  I ended up just giving up and got a Case Logic sleeve to put it into when not using it.  None of the case I saw or read about seemed to do the job w/o major issues\n3) No flash on the back facing camera (could have been integrated at low cost w/o impacting the units overall cost much)\n\nSummary:\nExcellent tablet for the price."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I've owned/own several tablets, and the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101 is still the best one I've owned. That's includes the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer Prime TF201, which I was forced to return due to issues. While the original Transformer TF101 can't match the Prime TF201 in raw processing power, the TF101 is just an all around great tablet. Its Tegra 2 dual core processor is still more than adequate. My Transformer TF101 is a mid-production \"B60\", and does not have any issues at all. Some earlier production models did have some issues, but by now, most of the issues are gone. Most of them were screen related, but the screen on my \"B60\" is flawless. There are no dead pixels, and absolutely no light bleeding. The tablet has performed flawlessly since day 1. I'm eagerly awaiting Android 4.x, which should make it even better. I do not own the TF101 Dock, so I can't comment on how the pair perform together. All in all, I highly recommend the original ASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101. It may not have the latest and greatest processor, but Tegra 2 isn't dead yet. Many new tablets that haven't even been released yet, will still be using this processor. The Transformer TF101 is just a great all around tablet. There is only 1 thing I don't like about it. It comes with a short 3' proprietary USB charge cable. I solved this annoyance by purchasing an inexpensive 6' USB 3.0 extension cable. If you decide to do this, the cable must be USB 3.0 in order to work, and not USB 2.0. ASUS  also sells a 5' charge cable for $20, that is standard on the new Prime TF201. It will work on the original TF101. My only other caveat would be shop around and wait for a deal. This tablet does go on sale quite often at a deep discount. I got my 32GB model for under $400. The 16GB model also gets discounted often too."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "The only reason this product is not getting 5 stars has everything to do with the Android OS.  We have both Apple and Android in this family; I personally prefer Android's flexibility.  The only issue really is that the tablet is able to download apps made for the phone that don't operate properly on the tablet.  The coming upgrade to Android 4.0 (ICS) will solve this issue.  Otherwise, as my first tablet, it is everything I had hoped for.  Easy, intuitive, solid quality equipment.  The tablet itself is really of good quality; the screen response is as I would expect and the unit feels solid in hand.  It is slightly heavy, but not a primary concern at all.  Overall, I would buy this tablet again."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "As many have pointed out, this isn't a desktop or even a laptop replacement. As long as you understand that, then this is a great computer to have.  As for me, it has met all of my expectations.  So far, I haven't even come close to maxing out the processor or memory.  I use this tablet for mostly web surfing, netflix, youtube, reading books, etc, and it just gets the job done.  I'm sure that it is capable of more, but I really don't need it to do much more than that.  If I want to game, then that is what my Playstation is for.  I could have waited for the Transformer Prime and the quadcore processor, but in truth, I just don't think it is necessary for a tablet, and it's certainly not worth the extra $200 or so.  The build is very solid and the screen is very bright and responsive to the touch.  I have read lots of complaints about the speakers, but I think that the volume and clarity are reasonable considering that this is a tablet.  Battery life is pretty good.  The docking station/keyboard/extra battery, in my opinion, is a must to get the most out of this tablet.  I'm sure Asus was thinking the same thing, because there is no usb port on the tablet, and the only way to hook up accessories like external h/drives is through the usb ports located on the docking station.  The only thing that really pisses me off about this tablet is the 40pin charger and cable.  The cheapest replacement I have found, if I ever have to replace it, is $40.  Also, it might be the shortest charging cable that has ever been invented.  There is no reason to use a propriaritary charging connector except to force someone to come to you to buy a replacement.  In spite of this, this is a great tablet to have and a pleasure to use."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I've owned the Asus Eee pad Transformer (purchased refurbished from Amazon), 16GB, WiFi tablet for about a month now. I purchased it for its portability and with the thoughts of substituting one of our laptops, of which I rarely use to its full capability. I understood going into it that a tablet wasn't going to be the equivalent to the laptop but I figured I could do almost everything I was doing (emails, surfing the web) on it. I might also point out that I am not a real techie, don't play video games, am sorta tech savvy but to put a rating on it, probably on a scale of one to ten, sitting around a 5 or 6.\n\nThe size of the Transformer is good for what I do and it's portable enough to take with me if I choose to do so. It's not too heavy when I hold it in one hand but would be for extended periods if I used a couple fingers...like one might hold a clip board. External connections are as follows: a single charging port on the bottom center (charging cord included), mini-HDMI port, a mini-HD card slot, and a headphone jack. There is a single rocker switch for the volume and a power/stand-by button. The size of the tablet is a bit narrower than a pad of letter-sized paper, the length is approximately the same...and actually just a bit thicker than a pad of paper.\n\nThe screen is very clear and sharp. Was particularly impressed with that. The drawback is that finger prints and smudges are the norm. You really don't see them when you're viewing something on the screen but when it's off, it looks like a kid, after he ate a hamburger and fries and then licked his fingers, was using the tablet. Frequent cleaning is needed if that bothers you.\n\nSo far, the operation had been almost perfect. I've noticed that on occasion, while utilizing the browser, it will unexplainably close. If I open it back up, it does so but doesn't go back to the web page I was on. Kinda frustrating sometimes if you're in the middle of something (like Craiglist looking at an ad) and you have to type in the search parameters all over again and go back to where you were. This doesn't happen frequently but since I've owned it, probably a hand full of times and is more than likely a software issue with the browser rather than an issue with the tablet. Email operation, once I got it set up (not the tablet's fault just had to figure out how my email service provider sent and received the info) has been excellent. Connectivity to our home WiFi network was automatic once I provided the security codes.\n\nFor those not familiar with Android-based operating systems, if you're familiar with the windows environment, it shouldn't be too much of a challenge. I had a few issues with figuring things out but have done so with little trouble. I often forget that the operating system began its life as a mobile platform. If you think of this tablet as a super-mobile phone (without the phone connectivity), you'll get the idea. I've found that for emails and surfing the web, it does a fine job. Long letters would be difficult as the digital keypad is not as easy to use but one can type up a single paragraph in about the time it takes to write up maybe two or three on a normal keyboard but that's me with my fat fingers. Your results may vary!\n\nSo in short, I recommend this tablet. You'll read many reviews that go both ways but I've found the Transformer to be a great performer. I have not been disappointed."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "While I have had this for only a week, I am struck by the fact that I can find little wrong with the Eee Pad.  Having not used an iPad or any other tablet computer, it is not possible to compare it with others.  I do not see it as a replacement for a laptop, a desktop, or even a netbook, but that is only my opinion.  I have one of each, and to me it is an add-on in the world of computing as against a replacement for one of the other concepts.\n\nThe only possible negative I can come up with is the way it is designed to attach the charging cable.  The connection is on the lower edge, and that makes it very difficult to prop it up while the unit is charging.  Naturally, the reason it is there is because that is where the optional keyboard dock would attach for those users with one.\n\nThe installed apps make a good starting point for using the Eee Pad right out of the box, and I have added very few apps during the past week.\n\nSo, to me, ASUS has designed and engineered an excellent piece of equipment.  It has sure satisfied me!"}

This is my first tablet and I got the keyboard dock with it and the pair is amazing. I read some reviews and forum post about Honeycomb 3.2 having issues or being laggy but I haven't noticed anything like that, maybe i will once Ice Cream Sandwich comes out. the screen is great, its so much easier to see things then on my htc droid eris or my old motorola droid 2 global (i know its probably the bigger screen) but its bright and clear. The tablet itself is built solid, doesn't flex when i'm playing shadowgun( i have a tendency to get a little to games) I can't get the wireless to work in my room there seems to be to much interference, but out in the living room i get 11.5 Mbps down and .96 Mbps up with is exactly what i pay for, and i have no problems streaming my desktop using splashtop hd. As for battery life i have been using it almost non-stop since about 11 am this morning and now 6 hours later at 6 pm, my tablets battery is at 100 % and the docks battery is at 22% witch is better then what asus rated it for. I will add more later.\n\n**update 1/15** just wanted to throw in that the speaker placement sucks. there are two speakers on the sides of the tablet right where your hands hold the tablet, so if your playing a game or doing anything with sound really, the sound is bad cause its going thru your hands."}

I liked it and thought the Web OS was pretty inovative.  The HP was much larger/ heavier than the Asus.  The main problem I had with the HP was the keyboard or lack thereof.  Anytime I wanted to type something it took forever.  I finally got tired of it taking forever to type a paragraph and saw the transformer at best buys.  After playing around on it I decided it might be worth the money and spent the money for it.  Boy am I ever glad I did.  I am typing this lightening fast.\n\nIn addition to the typing advantage the keyboar.d acts as a backup battery. I have been using the computer for about 12 hours of and on.  My tablet is at  94 percent.  When you use the tablet, then put it back on the keyboard, it recharges the tablet.  Pretty cool.\n\nYou can edit word documents and powerpoints with the right programs.  Not as good as Microsoft office, but doable.  The tablet works well and I am familiar with the android system from my droid incredible.

If you have wi-fi connection issues, it could be your brand of router or your router security settings (try different security protocols, WPA-AES, WPA-TKIP, etc.) What I like most about the Android OS is the freedom to customize the device, as well as the ability to easily copy pictures, music and other data from a PC to the device.

The keyboard feature that allows you to drag your finger from one letter to the next instead of having to hit each key separately makes typing a breeze. The slight curve that the back of the asus has makes handling and holding it very comfortable. Flash support means you can load virtually any web page. Polaris Office is great and the ability to control your PC remotely is an excellent addition. The battery life is amazing! I hardly ever have to charge mine. Even when I use it heavily in one day, the battery manages to last all day long.\n\nThis is not to say that the transformer is without flaws. The screen resolution is nothing to call home about and it's a bit bigger than most tablets, though this probably can be attributed to it's excellent battery life.\n\nI paid $300 for my tablet and have owned it for 2 months now. I can safely say that I got a lot of bang for my buck. If you're looking for a nice, solid, functional device to surf the web, remotely access your PC, take and record notes, and to just have fun with, this tablet may just be for you. As for comparing this tablet to the ipad, the only differences I can say exists, having used the ipad and knowing people that have one, is that the screen quality is better on the ipad and that the ipad is smaller, but probably just about as heavy as the transformer. The ipad's battery life is not as good as the transfomer's and the ipad also lacks flash support, which was a major deal breaker for me ever wanting one.\n\nOverall for $300 you can't get a better product than this. Can't say I regret this purchase, it's made my laptop virtually obsolete and I would recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing a tablet."}

The USB port was especially nice.\n\nI ended up returning the Transformer a week later just so I could get the Transformer Prime. I feel like the Prime is worth the extra $100 and wait time.\n\nThe Transformer was a great tablet, and I agree with most of the in depth reviews on this page. There was nothing it couldn't do. For someone who doesn't necessarily see the need for more storage space or a faster quad-core processor, the Transformer is the best tablet out there. Otherwise, wait a couple weeks for the Prime. Based on reviews, it looks like it'll definitely be worth it."}

I have searched many Asus Transformer and Android forums to find it seems to be a common issue without any clear cause or remedy.  Some suggest ditching the stock browser, clearing cache, blocking javascript, ditching flash, blocking facebook, factory resets among other cures, but many post that these remedies either don't work or work only a short time.  I have submitted problem to Asus three times without any help forthcoming.  Because the crashes are so random in occurrence it is a highly annoying problem when it does occur. It may not crash for weeks, then it will start to crash every other webpage viewed!\n\nThis tablet was purchased for pleasure, I don't need it for work or school,  but the option to have a keyboard dock along with Polaris app should be a plus for those needing these functions.  Wifi connects easily. When it is not crashing, the pages load quickly so that's a plus.  I do a lot of reading through the Kindle app, that works great, books download quickly and can read with wifi off to save battery.  Love having the mini hdmi, purchased cable here (  Gold Plated HDMI to HDMI Mini cable, 1.83 m/ 6 ft) that has worked flawlessly when used to stream tennis matches from espngo.com to my flat screen tv, the action flowed without noticeable judderring and pic and sound quality remained good. Netflix streams exceptionally well, have yet to have any buffering issue. Battery life remains good, another plus. Purchased a leatherette folio case ( Acase (TM) Asus Eee Pad Transformer TF101 Leather Case Folio with multi view Stand for Asus Eee Pad Transformer 10.1-Inch TF101 Android Tablet Wi-Fi )  which makes it easy to prop up in bed while reading or streaming video and on kitchen counter when viewing recipes and cooking vids. Took on vaca, nice portable way to have travel docs stored and close at hand. Camera ok, video seems better, have taken great videos of son playing tennis to playback later on tv and laptop, all clear and sharp. Wish the sound from device alone was better, but using hdmi to hook up to receiver while streaming music works fantastically.\n\nOverall, the Transformer TF101 is a good tablet.  If the browser didn't crash so inexplicably it be close to great. The hdmi function really does vault it over some tablets lacking this since it allows you to play streaming video and music to your hdmi equipped tv and stereo receivers. being able to save to sdcard is also a plus, along with having bluetooth functionality.  One year later I am happy with this purchase.\n************************************************\nOriginal review January 7, 2012\n\nPurchased the Asus transformer on black friday,along with an Acer Iconia a100. I had played with several android tablets at the stores for a while and bought these two models catching a great  sale price. Immediately opened and played around with the Iconia, loved it, the display is superbright, colors vibrant, sharp, apps worked seamlessly, only flaw was the very poor battery life and poor viewing angle. Looking at the tab off-center was like looking at a film negative. Decided to give the Iconia to my teenage son.\n\nThis left the Tf101 to be my toy. First impressions:\n\n1. The screen isn`t as vibrant, sharp or clear as I had expected. ( much less bright than the Iconia).\n\n2. The 10inch screen size is nicer to view webpages than the 7 inch screen, but it is more cumbersome to hold.\n\n3. Packaging comes with almost no instructions and you have to search the Asus website to download a tutorial which is not super informative anyway. I have been finding most help on working this thing from android forums.\n\n4. TOO MANY FORCE CLOSES. Sometimes I can have 5 tabs open switching back and forth with no problem at all. Most of the time I can have 1 page open and can`t get through a single story without the browser simply closing, no message, no nothing, it simply closes the page and goes to my home wallpaper screen. Reopening the browser doesnt bring back to the page it closed and I must go to the history tab to reopen it. (This morning trying to read a story on cnngo it did this 4 times:-( )\n\n5. The stock keyboard is a nice size, yet it somehow still is like typing on a phone, lots of errors and typos. And it lags.\n\nI have not loaded any games yet, I have actually loaded only a few apps.  Tune in radio works great, sound is fine and it plays without causing interruptions to web surfing. This is the most I have used the keyboard thus far, and it has not been the most pleasant experience, typing on this should be much better. This touchscreen is less sensitive than the Iconia, which was a little too sensitive/quirky for me. Overall, the screen vibrancy and clarity is not that impressive (again the Iconia is much, much better), the keyboard kinda sucks, and the all too frequent inexplicable browser page closing drag this tablet down. I had read so many reviews praising all its features so I don`t think my expectations were too unrealistically high, but for me the Asus Tf101 is average to mediocre in its performance and just having a longer battery life is not enough to make this a great tablet."}

I'm seriously considering returning the Transformmer because I prefer my IPhone...  Here's the list of disappointments:\n\nI spend a lot of time listening to Podcasts and music.  Frequently, the sound has an echo (tin can effect). I haven't found a way to adjust the sound (bass, treble, etc..).  How hard is it to add an equalizer?  Does the tablet have one and I just can't find it?\n\nScreen?  When did resizing a screen become an unnecessary feature? It's awkward playing Solitaire on a 10.1 screen.  Same with other games.  Again, could be possible there's a way (it's not intuitive!).  I enjoy having several apps open at once, game in one quadrant, TedTalk in another, Facebook, you get the picture.  Not possible with the Tablet.\n\nCamera?  I don't understand why a nice size piece of computing equiptment can't support a camera which meets the quality standards of a small IPhone or Blackberry?  Is ASUS just cutting cost corners?  How much more would it have cost?  The camera quality is very poor.\n\nPraise: I like the color of the shell :)  Pathetic I know.\n\nMaybe if I tried ten other tablets I'd rank this one higher."}

So I created trouble tickets with ASUS Support it can't be that big a deal, support will be able to get me through this easily.

One day it simply would not start. This was after I had been using it two hours earlier and done nothing to it in the interim. I tried charging it up but that did not help and the charger got quite hot. I looked on online forums and found that this was a fairly common problem with the TF101. Long pressing the power button (20 seconds or more) helped some people but not my case. Long pressing the power and down volume buttons at the same time (suggested on some forums) did reboot the Linux kernel. There was a message on the screen about booting Linux. However the system froze on the boot screen. I tried calling ASUS tech support but after being on hold for over 5 minutes I gave up. I returned the TF101 to Amazon.\n\nDo not buy this tablet.

Unfortunately this doesn't matter very much when the wifi reception is so poor. Two laptops, an android phone, a PS3 streaming netflix, and a Wii can all run in the same room and the Prime cannot. Furthermore when it is on the fringe of getting wifi it tends to somehow disrupt the entire network, bringing all other devices to a halt. May be just mine, but I have to return it within 14 days (to B.B.) or keep it. Too much to risk for five hundred dollars. I  hope they iron it out. Very cool, just bad wifi.

I am very surprised at the polish and overall quality of this device. Despite the plastic casing, some say it feels cheap, but it doesn't feel like it would fall apart easily. Also, this device is definitely thicker than the iPad 2 and not quite as sleek as its successor(Transformer Prime), but that is what I would expect from a device in this price range.\n\nThe display is of great quality, is in a wide format (great for videos) and also affords you extra real estate space with the optional keyboard accessory (I have large hands and have had difficulty typing on keyboard add-ons for the iPad2). The UI is intuitive, even with the touchpad or a mouse, (this was unexpected) and it really feels like you are getting the best of both worlds (tablets / netbooks) with regards to performance and usability.

My mom has the Ipad so I had a lot of time to play with hers before making my decision. I decided to give the Asus a try thinking that I could always return it if I hated it. This is my first Android device and I have had no problems adjusting.  I actually prefer the setup to the Ipad now. It is nice always having a home button at the bottom left of the screen rather than a stationary button on the edge of the Ipad. The price, widescreen, Flashplayer, HDMI port and SD slot are what make this superior to the Ipad for me.  My mom had to download an app to watch videos on Amazon, etc. because she can't use Flash and even then hers runs slow and lags a lot.  I have had no problems just clicking and viewing my videos.  I just plug my HDMI into my TV to view on my big screen. Another plus that I didn't expect, most of the apps on the Android market are free.  I haven't had to pay for one yet.  The only thing I have an issue with is the placement of the volume control.  It is so close to the power button that I have trouble when I try to adjust the volume sometimes and accidently turn it off. Just a minor complaint with an otherwise exceptional device."}

OK, so you want to use a shopping app -- fine -- you launch it, and it NEVER GOES AWAY -- that thing is following your every move forever.  The Android OS really should have considered this.  There are aftermarket apps that are designed to overcome this, but if you pay $500 for a tablet, you would like to have rudimentary control over the things that are running.  I contacted the vendor --- \"don't worry, the upgraded OS will be PUSHED out to your tablet --- probably any day now\".  That was 90 days ago.  Now I hear that Google has no control over the distribution of their OS, and that the manufacturer (ASUS in this case) has no burning desire to see you happy.

I think all of the tablets that run off the new Honeycomb platform are pretty equivalent.  Asus has great graphics and is pretty fast.  It's easy to navigate to all the settings and set up your Gmail.  Unfortunately the Honeycomb platform is still having Active Sync issues.  So if you use corporate email that uses Active Sync you won't be able to get your email yet.\n\nThe best part of the Asus is that it uses Gorilla Glass (I believe this is the only tablet that has the Gorilla Glass for it's screen).  If you have young kids, this is a huge feature; as the screen is almost unbreakable.  Since my tablet has pretty much been commandeered by my children, this is what sold me on the Asus.  Also, CNet rated the Asus Transformer #2 behind the iPad.  But I prefer Android platform because you have so many more choices on devices.  Not to mention that there are thousands of free apps on the Android Market.  Many games like Angry Birds cost money with the Apple Market or with the Nook.\n\nMy only problem with e Asus has been that it does lock up sometimes but I suspect all the tablets do this.  This is easily resolved by turning it off and back on again.  I will probably buy one for my oldest daughter for her birthday.  Overall, I have been very pleased with the Asus Transformer.\n\nColin"}

The iPad 2 has certain advantages when compared to the TF101-B1, but when you factor in the price, the upgradability to Ice Cream Sandwich OS, and the availability of a matching docking keyboard with extra battery life, SD card slot, and two USB ports, in my opinion the TF101-B1 is unquestionably superior."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "This is the first touch screen tablet I've ever purchased.  I did as much research as I could, debating between the Asus Transformer, the Samsung Galaxy, and the Toshiba Thrive.  I chose the Asus (mostly because of the docking unit which I also purchased) and was initially quite pleased.  I absolutely loved the touch screen.  The response time was very nice, the video playback was very pleasurable and, from a person that has little to no knowledge about \"apps\", this was not too difficult a hurdle to overcome.  The battery life, especially with the docking unit, is outstanding!\n\nI erred on the side of caution for the initial charging and charged it for at least 8 hours and I was content.  The wi-fi was sporadic in the house.  I'd get it in my bedroom, but lose it in the kitchen, a mere ten feet away.  That was not a deal breaker for me, though.\n\nNow, perhaps it was just my unit, but after about two to three weeks, the charging unit would not charge when I connected it.  I found it strange.  The charging unit would get really hot, but I'd not see the lightning bolt symbol to show that I had a connection.  I could not charge the tablet or the docking unit.  I am not a constant user of the tablet, so I'd give it a two to three day rest and try again.  I tried outlets in the kitchen, the living room, the dining room, and the bedroom. No luck.  Bummer.  Luckily for me, since I was not a constant user, the last charge that did work fully charged the unit and I was still at 95%.\n\nI was very reluctant to return it as I really wanted this charging issue to be magically solved, but no such luck.  An exchange option was not available for the tablet, or I would have loved to just exchange it, but no such luck.  I had to return the item.  I will keep searching for another Asus Transformer and docking unit.  I may just get lucky again and get it for the same price!  I'll keep my fingers crossed.\n\nI'll update later on the return process."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Let me start this review out by saying that I am and have been a techie for years.  My current employment is steeped in the Tech world -- Applying Internet Technologies for real world Business application, Application Project Management and my new venture, Android App Development.  My home is full of every gadget, phone, console, piece of audio/visual system you could possibly want to tinker with. Ok, with that out of the way, here are my initial thoughts (it may be lengthy, you have been warned. =D\n\nI was one of the fortunate ones to get my Original-Release Asus Transformer (referred to from now on as TF), during this year's Black Friday Sale at Best Buy for $249.00.  For the price of a Nook Tablet, I got a 10\" Powerhouse that exceeds most of my expectations.\n\nLOOK AND FEEL\nOne thing you'll notice about the TF is that it is a bit wider than the likes of a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10 or Motorola Xoom, due to the larger bezel.  Some have complained about this, saying it makes the TF look larger than it should.  This was done by Asus to accommodate the attachable Keyboard dock.  When attached, the Tablet and keyboard dock look and behave much like a net book or small laptop. Unfortunately, I have not purchased a dock as of yet, as I see no need to at this time.  I have tinkered with colleagues Xooms and Galaxy Tabs and I actually like having more bezel, as my fingers don't accidently choose options, etc. on screen like on those \"other\" tabs, while handling the device.  One of our Xoom users also agreed to liking the larger bezel on the TF.\n\nWhen I initially viewed online reviews and sneak peeks, I thought the color of the TF and the plastic back would be an immediate negative for me.  Well, I'm happy to say that after handling the TF at Best Buy, days prior to purchasing it, the TF actually feels great, solid and stiff in hand (even with the textured plastic back).  The build quality on the TF is quite high.  I must add one negative to the build quality though.  For some reason, the power button is very loose and has a bit more play in it than I would like.  I'm constantly thinking that it'll fall off someday soon if I'm not careful.  This may be an individual occurrence and not accurately reflect other units out there.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nThe TF has similar specs to other decent to higher end tablets out there: 1280 x 800 IPS display,  NVIDIA's Tegra 2 dual processor, 1080p HD playback, an SD card slot, and front and rear facing  cameras.  Nothing really popped out as being utterly stupendous.  But I will say, I was really  pleased with how quick and snappy the device feels.  When in Best Buy (prior to buying the TF) I  played with the Acer, Xoom, Toshiba, Samsung and TF side by side for hours and really liked the  responsiveness of the TF.  In regards to responsiveness, I'd personally say that the TF was right up there with the Samsung and Motorola.  Following the TF were the Acer and Toshiba in that  order.  The sharp display and Honeycomb 3.2.1 (right out of the box) were excellent selling points, not to mention the great display.  Did I mention the screen is made from Corning's Gorilla Glass??? Nice.\n\nI didn't exactly love everything about the TF.  For instance, although the screen looks great, you have to press a little harder on it to get proper response.  Unlike my HTC Evo's, the screen is not very sensitive.  You definitely need to be a little more deliberate with your presses than you might for your android phone (if you use one).  I spent a little time retapping the screen to get my presses to respond.  Now, I'm used to it, so it's not really a big deal.  It was annoying enough for me to mention though.  Also, I was a little disappointed that there is no native micro or standard sized USB port on the tablet.  The only way to gain access to one is by purchasing the $150 (as of this review) keyboard dock, which does include them.  A big minus?  No, but I would have liked to have been able to plug a flash drive into the TF right out of the box.\n\nSOFTWARE SUGGESTIONS\nSince many, many sights have reviewed Honeycomb running on the TF and it's pretty much the same on each Tablet, sans very slight cosmetic changes, I'll refrain from going into that. I originally purchased the TF for business use, but have quickly broken down and put a myriad of games on the device for my wife, kids and even an occasional game for myself.  All the games I have played do so smoothly and quite well.  Some must have games (for my family at least) and software are:\n\nGAMES\nAngry Birds (of course), Apparatus, Wind Up Knight, Zen Pinball, Jelly Defense, Shine Runner\n\nSKETCHING SOFTWARE\nDrawing Pad, SBM\n\nPRODUCTIVITY\nCisco Webex, MindJet, Supernote, Polaris Office, Dropbox, GMail (Although the stock mail app works great)\n\nMEDIA CONSUMPTION/NEWS/BROWSER\nNetflix, Crackle, Equalizer, AppyGeek, Google Currents, Maxthon Mobile Browser\nMISC\nBank of America, Kayak, Thumbs Keyboard, Tablet Market\n\nPLUS's\n+Solid, sturdy build quality\n+Feels nice in hand\n+Honeycomb 3.2.1\n+Speedy response times\n+Beautiful IPS Screen\n+Add-on Optional Dock that extends battery life and ports\n\nMINUS's\n-No USB ports on the actual tablet\n-Capacitive screen response - need to press firmly\n\nFinal Words: All in all, I really do enjoy my TF. Is it perfect?  No, but its perfect for my needs and it is definitely a decent piece of tech.  Would I buy another one at $249.00? Sure.  Would I buy one at the full price of $400?  Absolutely...if the Transformer Prime weren't right around the corner."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "The unit I'm reviewing is the ASUS Transformer TF-101A (10.1\" screen) with 16 GB of internal storage. I purchased my unit from Best Buy for $300 (I received a price-match for an HH Gregg ad on Black Friday). I tested the unit for about 6 weeks, thanks to Best Buy's generous holiday return policies.\n\nSince there are already a lot of reviews about the Transformer's basic specifications, I'll focus on the things which initially attracted me to it over other similar Android tablets.\n\n* Micro SD memory slot, fully accessible as additional storage.\n* Long battery life, approximately 9 hours.\n* Easy to root (if you're into that sort of thing; note that rooting normally voids your warranty).\n* Available matching keyboard dock, which adds a nearly-full size keyboard and trackpad, USB ports, full SD-card port, and additional battery which brings the battery life to about 15 hours (as of December 23, 2011, the keyboard can be found for about $130).\n\nThe micro SD memory slot worked perfectly well with a Transcend class 4 32 GB micro SD card. I was able to play 1080p HD videos directly from the micro SD card without any hitches - smooth video and audio, perfectly in sync. The player that I used was Mobo Player. Note that, before playing the video on the Transformer off the memory card, I converted the video to MP4 / stereo AAC format so it could be played back using hardware decoding. The software I used was Handbrake, which is free.\n\nThe unit has great battery life. I was easily able to go from early morning til late night on a single charge, with power to spare, with light to medium use including checking email, browsing the web, watching an occasional movie, and listening to music. That said, recharging the unit can be inconvenient, due to the very short charging cable (about 3 feet long). But on the plus side, the charging cable and unit are very light and quite portable. And as an added bonus, the charging cable is actually a USB cable, so can be used to connect to your computer.\n\nThe Transformer is apparently quite easy to root. There is at least one rooting method which can be performed on the tablet without even connecting it to a computer, which (according to what I've read) is very fast. Rooting your tablet allows you to get access to low-level parameters, which is useful for people who like to fine-tune things, and also lets you use certain applications which require access to those low-level parameters. Also, for even braver souls, rooting allows you to install completely different versions of the basic operating system, such as the new Ice Cream Sandwich / Android 4. That said, rooting generally voids your warranty, and, if you're not careful, can render your device unusable (a \"brick\"). In any case, if you're interested in rooting, the Transformer is easily rootable.\n\nI was not able to test the unit with a keyboard. However, it seems that if you're interested in getting a netbook, or replacing one you have, you should seriously consider a Transformer plus keyboard. Why? Because you would get:\n\n* Amazing battery life (15+ hours)\n* Amazing screen (IPS 1280x800, far far better than any screen you'll find on a netbook, and indeed, many laptops)\n* An absolutely dead-silent unit (no fans!)\n* Completely solid-state device (no hard drive which can crash)\n* Full-size USB ports (x2) to attach external peripherals\n* Full-size SD card slot\n* Plenty of quite usable office applications (the TF comes with Polaris Office, which is quite full-featured).\n* All for about $500 (slightly more than an Intel Atom netbook, but far better)\n\nThere were a few issues with my Transformer. The main one was that the microphone seemed to be very insensitive, making it more-or-less unusable. It was difficult to use voice-commands, and video recordings had little or no sound. Audio-only recordings were likewise very faint. I tried to use the Transformer to record a classroom lecture, but all I was able to get was the sound of me moving around in my chair, and even that was super-quiet. Skype video chats had similarly poor mic performance. It's unclear whether the problem is hardware (which would be unfortunate) or software (which could be fixed). I tested the sound levels using an app called Andalyzer (free in the Android Market), and found the noise floor in a quiet room hover around -56 dB. In comparison, my Sony Tablet S and my mother's Toshiba Thrive 10.1 had noise floors of about -66 dB. Both the Sony and the Toshiba have relatively good mic performance (though certainly not spectacular), and were usable in all of the situations described above.\n\nOther issues included speaker imbalance (right speaker was far louder than the left), light leak (some areas of the screen were brighter in the dark areas than other dark areas), and overall build quality (some creakiness in the housing). The speaker issue is probably a non-issue for most people, but it bothered me quite a bit. The light leak and creakiness should probably not be unexpected given the low cost.\n\nOverall, given the price I paid ($300 after price-match), the Transformer is a great tablet. However, its greatness is marred by a number of issues, including poor mic sensitivity. However, with the optional keyboard dock, I can see the Transformer as having great potential for playing the role normally played by a netbook, so it's definitely worth considering if you're interested in such use."}

But then it got progressively worse from there. I will do cons and then pros if that's ok?\n\nCons:\nPolaris Office - Failed on me several times, why include it if it doesn't work? There is no support for this application either.\nApps - There is no Android support mechanism that I can see. What do you do if there something wrong? Think about this. If you buy something in a store you can return it. Can you return an App???\nSkype - Fails to work. Causes issues with Skype on my other devices.\nSpeakers - Very poor sound from the speakers. My phone has better sound. You will need earphones unless you are in a cave.\nMarketplace - You can ONLY buy videos from Google. Therefore you can only buy from their collection which has no TV episodes. Surely there is a Competition and Monopolies Commission that can do something about this? Didn't they do this and sue Microsoft back in the day?\nVideos - I bought two videos to watch on a plane. I started watching one and then decided I would watch the rest later. It will not play for me no matter what. So, I decided I would try the second video. Just to be cruel to myself I paused and went out of the Video app to look at another app and when I came back this second video would not play either. Gave an error eventually.\nKeyboard* - The keyboard, sold seperately, has to be the worst designed piece of hardware I have ever come across. The spacebar is too close to the mousepad which is far too sensitive. If you are typing and the heel of your hand brushes off it expect to see your text somewhere else on the page.\n\nPros:\nDesign - Physically this is lightweight and slick. The concept of allowing a keyboard attachment is great but in practice fails.\nBattery - Seems to be really good.\nSoftware - Android is ok. Unfortunately they seem to accept mediocrity. In the long run I can see them failing as either Apple, Microsoft or some unknown will blitz them if they allow higher sales at the expense of mediocrity.\nBrowser - Pretty good. Some sites don't translate well. Anything that needs an internal move of the mouse such as a cursor bar will not work well or at all. Would be nice if the browser ranked bookmarks in order of most use.\nSupernote - This is really good. I used it a conference to takes notes instead of using a pen and paper.\n\nOverall I made the mistake of not understanding exactly what I would use it for and then testing each application. But who has time to do that?"}

Fed-up and after finding and purchasing it at MicroCenter in Fairfax, Va for $399 today, I was curious to see what amazon was selling it for.\n\nEdit:\nNow you'll see below some people do not see the validity of reviewing the price of an item on Amazon - so be it. Rather than skip this review and move on to the next one, they seem to think it more important to high-jack the thread, move off topic and complain about a valid concern when purchasing an item - the cost.\n\nIn short, be sure to check back often, having watched this item for some time, seems pricing for this is changing by the hour.\n\nEdit II:\nHaving now used with and set the device for a few hours now, I can say its very nice, color and sound are just as they are described.  Feels and works just as my droid phone, so if you own a droid you show feel right at home.  Hooking up to my wireless internet was fast and painless.  I am really impressed with this and thinking of buying another to replace my aging laptop, this one actually being a present for my elderly mother.

Watching video is great even in hd with barely noticeable jitter, netflix streams just fine after the app became available. This is one fine tablet especially for the price 300 dollars less than the ipad. You just will not go wrong with this tablet. The Asus comes with a front facing 1.3 megapixel camera and a 3.0 megapixel rear camera both leave a lot to be desired however in a pinch not bad if the area is light enough, and the front camera is for video chat if you like.

Most electronic devices can drain the battery, but so far this product has minimized this problem.  I was very impressed with that. I have my Wi-Fi set to turn off when the screen shuts off and the brightness is set to auto and it helps to preserve the battery life even longer. It charges quickly too. The only thing that is a little weak is the sound. I wish it was louder, but it is ok otherwise.  The front and rear facing camera work pretty good for a tablet camera. I wished if it had a flash (the Transformer Prime recently released has better sound and a flash). Asus did an excellent job with this tablet.

It was everything that a tablet should be - functional, plenty of processing power, nice screen, decent battery life.  Aside from being a little bulky, the Transformer was a device that I could see myself owning for many years.  I really liked that Asus has made a point of loading their tablets with with the most recent Android versions.  There were two main reasons that I decided to purchase the Transformer: (1) the Asus name and (2) the docking keyboard (brilliant idea, btw).\n\nAnd then the Blank Screen of Death (BSD) happened.\n\nI can't believe that I didn't catch this problem during the research phase of my tablet shopping.  Just do a web search of the following phrase \"eee pad transformer won't turn on\" and you may think twice about purchasing this product.  From what I gather, this is a common problem for Transformers.  After 13 days of use, my Transformer just refused to turn on.  Nothing I did would 'wake it up' and none of the recommended solutions worked for me (creative button pressing, prong bending, charger freezing, etc.).  I called Asus support and they RMA'd the unit.  The service representative said that it was probably a charger problem.  However, when I asked why I needed return the tablet so that the charger could be fixed, the answer was vague at best (I'm thinking there is a hardware problem that Asus knows about and can't fix with a software update).  I sent the unit back to Asus (I had to pay for shipping) and now I am waiting for the tablet to be repaired and returned.\n\nSo, here is the kicker, if the BSD hadn't happened to me, I would have easily given the Eee Pad Transformer 5 stars.  And quite frankly, I still really like the product.  I am hoping the RMA process will fix the tablet and I hope that it will turn out to be a reliable product that will be my friend for many years to come.\n\nUpdate 12/20/2011\n\nI purchased the Transformer on 11/22/2011 and it decided to stop working 13 days later.  I shipped the unit back to Asus on 12/06/2011 and Asus received my Transformer a few days later.  They fixed it on 12/15/2011 and sent it back to me via FedEx Ground the same day.  I received the Transformer on 12/20/2011.  So far everything seems to be in order (i.e. the Transformer turned on).  Asus replaced the motherboard (the entire motherboard!) and a few other parts as well.  Hopefully after at least 14 days of use my Transformer will still be working as expected.\n\nUpdate 12/24/2011\n\nBad news.  It happened again!  This is very frustrating.  Last night I charged the unit and unplugged it after it was done.  I tried to turn it on afterwards and... nothing.  Black screen of death.  I called Asus support and they RMA'd the Transformer again.  At my request, they agreed to pay for shipping.  Unfortunately they won't send me a new unit until my Transformer has been RMA'd 4 times.  What a joke.  Because of this issue and the terrible Asus support I have encountered, I cannot recommend the Asus Transformer.  And I am demoting this product from 2 stars to just 1.  As a contrast, several years ago my Verizon-based Palm Treo stopped working.  I called Verizon, they apologized, and sent me a new phone the next day.  There is no reason why Asus shouldn't do the same.\n\nUpdate 02/10/2012\n\nMore bad news.  After the second round of RMA repairs, tablet decided to stop working again.  Received the my tablet from the Asus warranty center  on 01/06/2012.  Today, the tablet broke.  It simply won't turn on.  This is completely unacceptable.  I'm not sure what my options are at this point, but I'm going to try to the best of my ability to convince Asus that they need to send me a completely different device.\n\nUpdate 04/02/2012\n\nI've had my tablet back from Asus's service center for about a month now.  No problems to report of *yet*.  An Asus representative did tell me that if the problem happens again that Asus would replace the tablet.\n\nNow that I've had the tablet for a few months, these are my overall feelings: Tablet = middling.  Asus customer service = horrible.  Middling tablet + horrible customer service = I won't purchase Asus again."}

Doesn't lock up, doesn't slow down. I can do just about anything with it that I would want to do with a PC (almost). The size and weight make it perfect to carry around and with the plethora of WiFi access points these days, I am rarely without access to the internet. Love IT!"}

Asus runs updates for their firmware all the time telling me that they have no plans to let this platform die on the vine.  Android is getting more and more apps every day making this better all the time.\nMynet, which is an Asus exclusive i believe is excellent for houses like mine with 4 or 5 computers - sitting on my couch i can connect to my wifes laptop and listen to its music or view the photos she has on the laptop, or just as easily tap into the movies on my desktop.  love it.\nHdmi mini is excellent and connecting this device to my big screen tv is great.  view pics, movies, whatever.  I even connected it to the tv and streamed ESPN3 for a Badger game that was not televised and it worked fantastic.\nAll in, i cant remember what it was like not to get up in the morning and have this tablet.  i can't wait for the new Transformer to hit the market as i will buy it immediately."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I can't really find bad things to say about this tablet. The specs are great. It is super fast for the most part even with some fairly intense multi-tasking happening. The tablet has the docking station which makes it into a laptop. The screen is nice and the graphics are impressive. The battery life is not bad at all. The device feels has solid and sturdy construction. It is slightly heavier than what I thought but I adjusted to the weight very quickly. It is not heavy, just slightly more than what I was expecting. With the addition of the Transformer Prime, I would expect this tablet to drop in price soon which will make it the best tablet for the money hands down...if it is not already there. If I have to give the tablet a knock, I wish it had a USB port (the T-prime doesn't either) and a flash on the camera."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "My wife is not as computer literate as I so we bought her an iPad a few months ago. I have done all her syncing and am the only one who works with iTunes.\n\nI hate being told I have to do something somebody else's way....in this case Apple's.\n\nThe lack of flash technology on the iPad is a pain...we went to sent some of her photos to Walmart from the iPad and no go. Walmart's photo site apparently uses flash technology. Other sources on the web provide the info that Apple and Adobe (flash technology people) are in a spitting contest. Flash technology is available on all the android tablets.\n\nI like the Asus very much, and particularly the more \"open\" Android operating system. It is a pleasure to be able to go to the File Manager and do just that....manage files. You can do it via Windows Explorer, or directly on the tablet. Try doing that with an iPad. The iPad files come up in Windows not with the name you have designated, but with some coded name Apple has decided on. Apple just doesn't want the user managing files, except through iTunes. And talk about \"intuitive\". Whose intuition would tell them that iTunes is the gateway--and the ONLY one-- to all media and all players. Books, videos, devices, photos, etc?\n\nOh, and if you transfer photos into the iPad by any means other than the optional/extra card reader you will not find the file information....such as date created (picture taken) transferred to the iPad. The \"other means\" consists of syncing photos from the iTunes photo library (it pulls them from other sources on your computer) into the iPad via the USB connection. It took me 2 hours with an Apple tech rep before he told me \"Apple does not support jpg file information other than titles with Windows.\" What he did not tell me is what I have said here....as long as you stick with Apple's system....the optional card readeer.....the file info is intact.\n\nA negative for the Asus....it is short of the iPad's battery life by maybe 25%. Not a big issue unless you are headed for a 6 hour plane trip, + concourse wait time + tarmac time. I have played with screen brightness and media usage enough to be confident of my 25% estimate.\n\nA negative for the Android system: It has to do with the Market: this is where you purchase apps, same as on the iPad. The iPad allows each purchase to be password protected. With the Android (Google) market, once you open an account anybody using your tablet can but without further authorization. The google people tell me they know this is a shortcoming and are working on a fix. Meantime, my plan is to password protect the tablet itself whenever I am in an environment where the tablet has the potential to be stolen or misused.\n\n12/31/2011 update.\nA negative for Asus: you cannot use another standard type USB battery charger to power/charge the t101. I bought a Motorola universal charger. (Taking a 15 hour plane trip) It will charge wife's ipad but not the transformer. Shame on Asus."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Ok, just to summarize before i get started: i LOVE my tablet, it's my favorite toy and i've been enjoying it for awhile now. Had i written this review when i frist bought it that might not have been a true statement. I struggled a lot with figuring out how to use it, and i'm not terribly experienced in technical matters so that didn't help. Now i can finally say its awesome and just got awesomer!! IT PLAYS NETFLIX!!! The update just went through for the tablets so if you were waiting to buy, now is finally the time.\n\nOk, so here's the breakdown. I did lots of research and wanted a bit screen for my tablet, and this product offers the biggest screen size for these size tablets for the best money. If you are familiar with the Android operating system from phones then the transition will be a lot smoother, it was new to me, which also caused a few headaches. I had to find the right aps to get my tablet to do what i wanted. I mainly wanted a tablet to read online manga and watch movies, i'm not as much of a gamer but i am a serious reader. I bought the tablet and then bought a 32GB microchip for storage.\n\nFor watching movies on the tablet off an SD card, i had a hard time at first. I downloaded sooo many apps trying to play my video content. I kept trying to convert movie file types on my laptop just to make it work on my tablet, and in the process drove myself nuts. I tried app after app till i finally found the one i needed, and it was free! You need to use the QQPlayer (It's a blue app that looks like a movie reel), so far it has played every file type i have.\n\nI also had a hard time FINDING the movies on my tablet to run them. I finally realized if i use the File Manager icon (should already be on your tablet) and tap the folder picture (it has a folder and an arrow in the bottom right corner) and choose Removable, then click on MicroSD-THERE are all your files! Such a headache i got figuring that out!! Choose the file you want to watch, open with the QQPlayer app and you are good to go! I also have Amazon Prime membership and i am able to watch Amazon Prime movies on my table via the Amazon website, and of course now i can watch Netflix too-so excited!!\n\nAs for reading on your tablet, i discovered you need a variety of reader aps to read everything you have unless you want to convert the file types into one. You need 3 reader apps: Moon+ Reader(great for ebub books), MyLibrary(which i believe comes loaded on your tablet already-reads most files but struggles with pdf) and Polaris Office (which is also loaded on there, and perfect for pdf's!) It's also pretty cool becuase you can download the Kindle Reader to your tablet and read Amazon Kindle books on your tablet (it's almost like having a Kindle! lots of free books!) and same for B&N books/app as well.\n\nDouble Twist is a great (free) app i use for playing music and podcasts, it also plays videos, etc. I don't use my tablet for music much as its not terribly loud. It's fine if you're holding it or sitting right in front of it (as in watching movies) but its not loud enough to blast your music across the room if thats what you want.\n\nFor those that love manga (and yaoi!) there are two apps i would recomend: MangaZoo and Mango (though i am not sure you can get Mango anymore, seems to be hard to find) but both are very good. MangaZoo sometimes has 'connectivity issues' when i try to open it but its worth sticking with, especially compared to several of the other manga sites i tried, and again both are free. Also, for those that are interested, Elfquest now has thier entire library scanned, very cool, you can read it on your tablet!! Awoooo! LOL\n\nI am not much of a gamer but i do like the standards: Angry Bird, Jewels and so on. There are LOTS of free apps in the Android Market, i am impressed by the content. I also have downloaded tons of kid apps for my niece and nephew to play with, just be forwarded, check the comments before you download those. Sometimes there is advertising that is inappropriate for kids (like singles adds with busty women in some of the memory or art games) not sure why, i am sure the developers don't mean for that to happen but just be cautious and check it out yourself. I can tell you my two love to play 'Lets Play with Trains', any drawing/coloring apps and Memory-i admit to playing with the art ones too, they really are fun! But again, always check the adds!\n\nAlso i will say that my computer had a hard time recognizing my tablet in order for me to load content on it. I use my computer at work, apparently my laptop at home (even though i have done all the updates) doesnt recognize the extra hardware, though it does recognize my other externals drives. So you may have to check around to find a computer that will acknowledge it. I tried to find a solution online-there are forums and sites, and the tablet does have a connectivity fuction in its set up, but so far, no dice. This may just be my inexperience though.\n\nLasty, battery life; as others have mentioned it charges in no time flat, two hours and i am up and running. The laptop lasts for about 8-10 hours i would say. You can easily watch a movie, then still have plenty of life to read, surf or what have you. You may be able to play two movies and still have juice left for an hour or so, but i have not tried it. The computer power cord is short though, so you will want to grab an extension cord if you want to use it plugged in, but thats an easy fix.\n\nI also wanted to share a good solution i found instead of holding my tablet all the time. Tablet holdes are expensive but there is a 'Peak Floor Stand for iPad', which is a music stand that i bought (the tablet isn't heavy per se, but you wouldnt want to hold it for hours to read or watch a movie) for 30 bucks, though its now 40 and it does hold the transformer eeepad. Its not a snug fit, but if you put the tablet in vertically it will rest in the bottom two holders and if you center it, the holders on each side will secure it. I can turn the tablet sideways in the holder and its no problem, but the two holders at the top that slide open for you to insert the tablet will not close, however unless you plan to turn it around in a 180 your tablet won't fall out.\n\nHope this helps and also gives you an idea of some of the 'hidden' costs you might want to consider before purchasing. My recomendation is buy this baby, its so cool! I know that Amazon and B&N now have cheap tablets, but i really do believe you get more bang for your buck with this. I could be wrong since i don't own a Fire (but apparently your content is limited mainly to Amazon) but i am so happy with my tablet i don't think i will be purchasing another one any time soon anyway!"}

I love apple products but I wanted to know what my options were seeing that tablets are relatively new expecially in their use and I had no idea what was out there. After a lot of research it was clearly a decision between this asus product or an ipad. What tipped the scale for me was the ability to turn this thing into a netbook with a very good and useful keyboard, hence the name eee pad transformer. I am glad I went with this device because it is very cool. I also love the fact that I can play flash video on it as well.\nI have heard about people having problems with the power button but I've owned this product for a little over a month now with extensive use and I haven't experienced the issue.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Have been using my Eee Pad Tranformer for over two months now and have been very pleased with it.  In fact, I prefer using the Eee Pad over my new laptop.  It is so easy to take this unit with me anywhere and play games or surf the web.  I have not yet used the Polaris Office suite for documents, but the rest of the software is solid.  Features I am particularly happy with are the GPS and Google Maps--they make trip planning easy while on the road with the bigger-than-a-gps-unit screen and wi-fi capability.  It doesn't replace my GPS unit but allows another option while traveling.  I just wish the GPS was faster to load the current location.  We do live in Germany, so maybe the satellite signals aren't as strong(?).\n\nWe have not been able to test the media streaming since Germany's draconian laws regarding sharing of media prevent us from Hulu, Netflix and the like.  The mini HDMI port works great, though, and is an unexpected extra that will likely make many folks happy.\n\nThe available keyboard adds a TON of battery life, two USB ports, and additional SD card slot (not micro) and a clamshell form that makes your new Eee Pad easy to carry around without a case.  It does weigh a bit more with the keyboard but it is still not as heavy as our HP Mini netbook while being much better looking and easier to use.  Can you live wthout the keyboard?  You may never miss it but for me it has been quite worthwhile.  Best thing is I can leave the keyboard at home when I want easier portability.  Try that with a netbook.  Best yet, you can get several light days/evenings of use off of each charge when the keyboard is attached.\n\nBest of all, I get all the basic functions I need with a robust software market that is free from Microsoft and Apple rhetoric and associated cost bloating.  While the Eee Pad might not replace all the functionality of a desktop or laptop, it is a worthwhile device for surfing, e-mail, navigating, light wordsmithing, and simple games."}

At first I thought \"what the heck do I need a tablet for?\" At 63, I was happy as a clam with my PC and really never thought I could possibly have a use for a \"snazzy little hand held gimmick that seemed more appealing to kids than someone my age\". Mistake Big Mistake. I like that it was not hard to learn how to use, it's lightweight and not at all cumbersome [which I thought it might be].\n\n But what is it that I really like about this little computer! First thing, I loaded it with grocery shopping [one with a cool bar code scanner!], recipe conversion, recipe box and cookbook apps. Now all I have to do to keep my grocery/pantry list updated is scan the bar codes in my pantry! Could not be easier, no typing no searching....just a quick scan and its in my list!!

What a time saver!!\n\nI downloaded my favorite recipes into a \"recipe card file\" app. Now all I do is set my Transformer in its combination carry case/stand, pull up the recipe and start cooking!\n\nI like the \"transformer\" idea of this tablet!

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "If you are buying this just as a tablet there are probobly better options out there. Mine actually works quite well, but I've only had it for a few days and I would be concerned about quality if I didn't need a tablet with a keyboard. However, since this is the only tablet that also functions as a net book, it was a must have for me. I've been waiting for years for something like this. It's great to be able to navigate with the screen, and to be able to read books and also write papers on it is fantastic.\n\nAnyway, you've heard all the good things so I'll get right to the bad. There is no users manual. To be precise, it came with a tiny booklet that says 'users manual' on the cover, but this is clearly a ruse. There is nothing in it that explains in any useful detail at all, how to use this machine. The book is all of 10 pages long and none of it actually pertains to using the device, except for how to charge it and how not to electrocute yourself while doing so).  There is no built in manual either, or if there is they've managed to hide it quite well. I had to do a google search and get onto a forum just to find out how to turn off the pad. I located a pdf manual for the new transformer coming out, but most of it was missing. I spent half an hour trying to figure out how to cut and paste on Polaris Office, the stock office software loaded onto the tablet, and still have not any idea how to do it. No help with a google search either. There is also no onboard dictionary on Polaris, and no spell check. These are a couple of huge over sites for what should be a word processing program (which is a huge part of why I bought this machine, and is probably why anyone would buy it). It does all kinds of mostly useless crap, like align right, center, and some other stuff that I don't even know what it is, but two of the main things you want in word processor it does not do. To be accurate, I think there is a way to cut and paste, I just have not found it yet.\n\nIn closing, it is a good machine, but owing to reliability issues cited by many owners and a couple of over sites on the part of the makers, I would probably wait to see what updates become available if I didn't need a tablet with a keyboard in which case, this is it. And as long as it keeps working, you could certainly do worse.\n\nADDENDUM:\nThis was a great machine until the latest os update, aptly named Honeycomb, because it is full of holes. The touch screen was a bit spotty before but now it does not work at all about a third the time. It used to have two different places to save pages, so you could have your most used pages displayed as on a Mac, but also have a list of bookmarks. I found this to be quite a useful function. Now the only way to bookmark is to add it to your most used pages, making this function pretty much useless due to the clutter and disorganization it causes (since you can no longer organize it, the machine just jumbles them together in a seemingly haphazard way. In addition Facebook doesn't work on it any more unless all you  want to do is brows and not write anything. There are other issues i have encountered with the new os but I can't remember them all. I can say that the usefulness of this device has probobly been cut in half since the latest update. Hard to imagine what kind of group of monkeys would spend so much time and effort to make a product worse. Oh, and there's the crashing. It's only happened once where I was working on something important, and was fortunate not to loose any data, but I now have some trust issues with it which lead me to believe I should buy a net book. In addition the internet shuts down all the time. Not a huge problem since I mostly use this device for entertainment, but still a consideration."}

Our family enjoys technology and she's at that age where she would appreciate a device like this, especially since she's been hinting that she wants one for months now.  I seriously considered getting the Galaxy Tab 10.1 but the lack of a MicroSD slot and their reputation for extremely slow firmware updates made me take a look at other tablets.  Once I did my research on this tablet and knew IT was the one, so I got it along with the keyboard dock.\n\nI've been configuring the tablet (while my daughter is asleep at night) and it is really an awesome device!  I downloaded several educational apps and a few games that I think she will like from the Android Market.  I also downloaded an App Lock that allows me to password protect any apps I do not want her to have access to. This makes the tablet much more kid friendly\n\nPros:\n- Excellent screen\n- The dock is a great addition\n- microSD Slot and USB slot with dock\n- Asus provides timely software updates\n\nCons:\n- Charging cable too short\n\nI loved this so much I have pre-ordered two of the new ASUS Transformer Prime tablets for my wife and I."}

Do yourself a favor and do not buy it. If you don't have an ipad 2 yet, save your money and get an used ipad 1 for about $250 or simply get an ipad 2.let's start with the cons...\nLaggy response, despite a powerful hardware the android interface is unresponsive and slow. Comparing to my ipad 2, typing with onscreen keyboard is a total nightmare. I have to slow down considerably  my typing speed because my on screen keyboard can't keep up to my fast and accurate typing speed.\nBrowsing is totally a challenge here.default browser crashes very often,specially after opening a 3rd window tab. Zooming with multituch gestures is dissapointing. It is simply too slow and laggy.\nScreen looks washed out if you compare it to ipad 2 screen. Acer iconia tab a500 has a better screen.\nExpensive and overpriced gadget. Android 3.21 to blame for. This shouldn't cost more than 50% of the cheapest ipad 2, because this is what you are going to get, about 50% of the functionality of the ipad 2.\nWe need quad core arm cpus only to cover on android 3. XX flaws.\nI am going to keep it only waiting for official asus ice cream sandwich 4. XX\nPros:\nExtensive line of accessories from asus. However after getting them all (the ones really neccessary as asus keyboard, asus usb reader and sd reader)you can easily pass the $500 mark. At that point is a no sense getting an android tablet, no matter if it has a 4 or 8 core cpu.\nConclusion: this is an amazing gadget, not really a functional tablet, browsing is terrible, watching videos is dissapointing, screen quality is a low quality screen, again if you compare it to ipad 2 screen. If you don't have an an ipad 2, you will probably won't notice any of my observations here. Acer iconia a500 and toshiba thrive are much better values.\n\nupdated 11/28/2011\nAfter 12 hours playing and dealing with I almost gave up, I was going to return it and finally decided to root it, I had to change the filesystem to ext2 before and then Installed latest revolver ROM and finally overclocked it to 1.5 Ghz, I couldn't believe how fast and responsive it was. Highly recommended to install custom rom, even if you are not a power user, just follow the instructions and you will be ready to go, the stock honeycomb on transformer tf101 is disappointing. Now I'm using everyday, I'm ordering the asus dock station and my Ipad 2 64 Gb is taking dust now. Already started spending some bucks on the great android apps from the market.\nI highly recommended this tablet due its popularity and 3er party support, currently with the motorola xoom, are the most popular and supported tegra 2 android tablets. Money Well spent here."}

I'm a \"value\" shopper, and I couldn't make the justification to spend $650 on the iPad especially since a lot of my friends said they actually rarely use their iPad. I currently have an Android phone but will be switching to iPhone. I stayed up till about 4 AM using it, and primarily purchased it because it's a hybrid of a netbook/tablet and the 16-18? hour battery life when combined with the docking station.  I travel constantly on many trans-atlantic or trans-pacific flights so I wanted something functional for me to work or pass time on the airplane. There are lots of pros (battery life, lightweight, fast response, beautiful screen, Flash support) and I really can't complain for the price point...but here are my complaints :P\n\n1) App and Movie selection is very limited:\n- The apps are not yet well developed for Android tablet. Even the Facebook app is just a blown up version of what I see on my Android phone and does not utilize the screen space well at all. This is very annoying/frustrating to get so many poorly designed apps. The apps add a lot of functionality, so don't underestimate this when calculating the value proposition of the iPad.  I am kind of wishing I just took the plunge to get the iPad + a bluetooth keyboard for the added functionality from apps and integration with iPhone.\n- A lot more movies and TV shows are available on Amazon Instant Streaming and iTunes compared to the Google Videos. I read in a forum there is an app that has been extracted from the KindleFire for watching Amazon movies on android tablets, but it's a bit confusing to download to not necessarily optimized for android tablets.\n\n2) The camera quality is poor:\nI tested it with Skype video chat this morning, after using a Logitech HD webcam for several years.  The Logitech webcam has some sort of auto light adjustments that made my skin complexion look glowy, but the quality on this camera is a bit grainy looking and not very flattering.\n\n3) Office not quite functional (and hence my ability to do work):\nThe built-in Polaris Office interface is so strange that I will need to buy a separate application if I want to do any work on planes/trains/ automobiles, which adds another $10-15 dollars, e.g., to get QuickOffice.  Even with this, I don't think I'll ever get the functionality I really need to make say, a Powerpoint presentation or develop an Excel model on the go.\n\nI'm still waiting for the holy grail tablet that allows me to be fully functional from a work perspective, while offering a seamless media entertainment experience."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Let's begin with the specs. Physically, the tablet PC boasts a 10.1-inch IPS screen display, which is just perfect if you love to play games or watch movies. The screen itself can capture a lot more details that may be left out if you're using a smaller tablet. It has a resolution of 1280 by 800. While not true \"HD\" HD, but you can expect images to stand out quite beautifully. It isn't the lightest at 1.5 lbs (680g), but it is less than most of the Tablet PCs on the market. The tablet is very comfortable to carry around and the edges are easy to grip.\n\nIt is fitted with Android 3.2 OS, more commonly known as the Honeycomb, as well as an NVIDIA Tegra(tm) 2 processor. It comes with 40-pin docking port, used to attach it to the optional ASUS Transformer accessories keyboard dock, and a number of ports including HDMI. You can additionally expand storage through the microSD slot up 32GB. There's also 1GB of RAM, a pair of webcams, 1.2MP front facing and 5.0MP rear facing, along with an e-compass, light sensor, gyroscope and GPS.\n\nThe ASUS transformer also showcases its flexibility through the use of the optional keyboard dock. When attached, your tablet PC immediately converts itself into a \"netbook.\" Other tablets such as Acer Iconia W500 also offer a full-sized keyboard, but ASUS seems to be the only one who got the configuration or design right. There's a forty-pin dock, where you need to fit the keyboard. The easy snap-on, snap-off model is certainly admirable. Moreover, you can tilt the screen in your preferred position, usually to remove or reduce the glare. The keyboards, on the other hand, have keys that are not only functional but are very soft to press; and you can use it to charge your battery or improve your connectivity. It should be noted that the keyboard dock itself also houses a battery - a Tablet PC first!\n\nAs mentioned, this tablet PC sports the Android Honeycomb OS, which can be both a blessing and a curse depending on what your priority is. A big advantage of this OS over iOS is that it's easy to customize to fit the needs and preferences of the tablet manufacturers. iOS is proprietary to Apple. The Android OS has the ability to multitask (allowing you to have more than one App open at the same time). The older versions of this OS were mainly designed for smart phones, so the Honeycomb, which ASUS uses on this tablet, is the newest and designed to suit tablet PCs. As expected, too, the tablet offers Flash support, which is lacking in the market leading Apple Tablet PC the iPad.\n\nThe tablet also makes it very easy to manage all your files. You can decide to create a collective repository for all your videos, photos, and copies; and you can move them in different storage areas without having to connect your tablet to the computer all the time. The NVIDIA processor is praised for its speed and high performance, making it well suited for gaming. This also facilitates the fast multitasking. Our ASUS Transformer review has definitely shown that the upsides far outweigh the downsides for the device.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to love the ASUS Transformer and why it deserves a lot of commendations, including as one of the best Android Honeycomb devices. It's cheap, it's packed with pre-loaded Google apps, and it possesses a gorgeous display screen, and runs the latest Honeycomb 3.2 whose apps catalog is growing at an exponential rate. The ASUS Transformer definitely has found a place as one of the best Tablet PCs currently on the market."}

Have been very happy with the motherboards and other hardware from ASUS. Also the support and driver's for these boards has been excellent and new drivers for them are being developed and made available years after the model is discontinued. Thought that that would be a good indicator of the quality that I could expect from their other products.\n\n6/8/11 - I purchased the ASUS TF101 16gb model for my wife's bday , and she was very excited about having it. She has a Kindle 3rd generation and other electronics but wanted something that would be a smallish internet browsing/work machine.\n\n7/1/11 - Purchased the attachable ASUS Mobile Docking keyboard and have been very happy with the tablet as a convenient web tool for personal and she has been using it for the traveling she does for work.\n\n9/28/11 - On her work trip to San Diego the unit will not boot. The display is dark but you can see the back lighting is working. No text or any other indication that it is coming to life. Call ASUS support. Not very technically helpful and have to explain the problem a few times to a few different people.

Everything that was on system still on the system and working normally.  Overall would give ASUS repair process a B- grade. Long process and I had to search and call to get information about where it was in the process.\n\n11/23/11 - Unit is doing exactly the same thing. I do not believe this. Very disappointed and speaking to customer support does not reassure me that anything will be different. She states that ASUS service is the governing body that determines if a different unit will be provided as a replacement. I was pretty clear that I didn't want this unit back because I believe it is defective. Does not sound like that will happen and I will get this unit back \"repaired\" and waiting for it to break again.\n\n01/31/12 - Sending unit in again to repair the same exact problem. Why will they not scrap this unit and provide me with working hardware I do not understand. I have been a user of their products including lcd monitors, motherboards and such, but I can honestly say I will steer clear of their products due to this continuing problem. I am going to keep the keyboard away from this and not attach it to see if that has anything to do with this problem.\n\n2/15/12 - Notified that it has been shipped and on the way back to me. Oh yipee, can't wait to use it for a week and send it back in.\n\nI cannot recommend this item for purchase based on the problems we have had with its reliability and with ASUS customer service.\n\nASUS Transformer 16GB receives my lowest grade, F- (Yeah that's right, MINUS)"}

But, overall, the experience of using this thing drives me INSANE... *way* more often than not.\n\nThe hardware package is nice, and I love the facility of a real key board, but none of it \"just works\".  Speaking of the keyboard... it's really weird how, when you plug the tablet into the keyboard, it doesn't see the battery as an extension of its existing battery... the dock actually \"charges\" the tablet, which leads to weird inconsistencies in how long the battery lasts.\n\nMost annoying however is that, without fail, while it's in the dock, even when I turn it ALL THE WAY OFF, within hours the charge is dead in BOTH the dock and tablet.  To date, nothing has fixed the issue (multiple firmware updates). If I undock the tablet, it can go days on standby and, of course, weeks when fully powered off.\n\nOh, the camera SUCKS.  I mean SUUUUCKS.  My venerable, aged Nexus One Android phone takes WAY, WAY better pictures than this thing.\n\nThen there's Android itself... even the most trivial tasks can become 30 minute time-sucks b/c so many things don't QUITE work like they should.  Things I can do on my desktop/laptop in 5 minutes often take 20 minutes on this thing, either b/c the browser crashes, the tablet locks up, the website doesn't work any one of the *FOUR* blasted browsers I have on this thing... it's just annoying.  I have an Android phone, where I feel similar frustrations.\n\nI wanted to like the Android tablet experiece, but it's so annoying.  So why not 1 star instead of 2?  Well, it IS a nice piece of hardware... maybe Android 4 will make this thing usable."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "It has been such a long journey for me. I got my eyes on this tablet since last July. My goal to own a tablet is to easily annotate journal articles and lecture notes for Uni (nerdy, I know!). Well, I guess any tablets will do that. But the idea of having a complementary keyboard dock was so appealing. But then, I thought I could buy a separate generic wireless/bluetooth keyboard and a docking site separately which cost me less than $100. But, I didn't think it will be as mobile as having THE Transformer keyboard plus, that idea would actually suck the battery life out instead of adding it.\n\nHonestly, my experience with Android had been awkward. In fact, I have to sell my Sony Xperia Ray because I rather stick with my ancient iPhone 3GS. An iPad would be great but I was not willing to spend the price. I considered Acer Iconia which is somehow the cheapest tablet around but my experience with Acer had never been good. HP tablet was a disaster, so they said. Blackberry Playbook and Motorola Xoom didn't get good reviews as well. So I left with Toshiba Thrive or Asus Transformer.\n\nMonths after, Kindle Fire was announced at a very jaw-dropping price. I was confident that this was for me. Then, I realized that a 7\" inch display would defeat the purpose of me buying a tablet in the first place. Plus, I don't reside in the US which I believe is a disadvantage based on the reviews.\n\nDays before I made my final decision, Asus Slider and Sony Tablet were out. And they were awesome when I tried them in Harvey Norman. But, their prices in Aussie were just e-x-p-e-n-s-i-v-e.\n\nI was hoping to buy the Slider from Amazon but they did not offer shipping to Aus yet. At the same time, US dollar dropped massively and I knew that was the right time.\n\nSo, there you go, how Transformer made me $400 poorer :) But darn, I love it. The back has this gorgeous finish, it is light, sensitive, with long battery life and superb HD viewing. Never expected using Android on tablet will be this easy and versatile.\n\nAnd yes, I did use my tablet to study for my finals...in bed :) Right now I have to learn how to resist the temptation to buy ALL the super cheap kindle book on Amazon."}

The clincher, however, is removable storage. She wanted to travel with videos, and if you want extendable storage, Android is the only game in town.\nWe chose the Transformer, in short, for \"bang for the buck\". Great screen, responsive processing, and Honeycomb interface is well thought out. If you go for the keyboard, you get a \"two-fer\" netbook/tablet combo, and the extra batery life can't b overstated. The tablet alone is still a great tablet--IPS screen good from any angle, built pretty solid. Speaker sound was a bit weird, but that got fixed with an update a while back.\nMy only gripe is the proprietary cable for connecting and charging. I understand, since the connecion also serves the keyboard, but if you lose it, it's 30 bucks versus a couple for a micro-usb for the Acer Iconia...\nYou won't regret a Transformer purchase."}

I had reservations with buying this item now since the Transformer 2 is around corner and I was concerned about the speed of the current processor. It's actually very fast - web pages load quick, scrolling is smooth, and video playback is not choppy. It also looks and feels sleek and solid. It's a great alternative to a laptop or netbook, especially if you purchase the docking keyboard which not only adds a extra battery life but also additional ports like USB and SD slot for memory expansion. This is my first experience with Android and I must say it has a higher learning curve than iOS but I actually prefer the interface and customizability over the iOS. I like having widgets on my screen to view random stuff like news feeds, email, etc. My favorite feature of the Transformer is MyCloud where I can remotely view and control my desktop PC from anywhere with WiFi. It literally allows you to control and view everything from your PC on your Transformer.\nAlthough I'm very happy with the Transformer, I did have to go through 2 other Transformers to get the perfect one. The first unit I got was a B60 lot and it had an issue with the unit rebooting every few minutes and lightbleed around the edges. I could've lived with the lightbleed but I didn't know if the reboot loop was a software or hardware issue so I did an exchange anyway. The second unit was a B50 lot and although it didn't have rebooting issues, the lightbleed was severely worse. I pretty much retuned it the same day. Finally the third unit, also a B50 lot was perfect. It still has lightbleed as expected with all IPS but it's barely noticeable and it doesn't have the reboot issue. You do run the risk of getting a worse unit with each exchange but for the price of the product I didn't want to settle. I was lucky that the third was as perfect for me.\nOne thing to note that I've read in some forums, I did notice that the screen on the B50 was a lot more vibrant than the B60. The B60 colors were a bit muted in my opinion.\nOverall, I'm extremely happy with the Transformer and I highly recommend this tablet."}

The trouble came up, however, in two places - 1) The keyboard absolutely devastated the battery life and 2) Nothing runs on Honeycomb.\n\nWhile I know there were issues connected to the keyboard and battery life they were supposedly fixed on newer units and both of the pieces model numbers were beyond the affected models. However I still saw up to %10 drops in battery life per hours in normal \"sleep\" mode and 6% with the non-emitting \"Airplane Mode\" turned on. Considering I bought this to toss in the back seat for when I needed something to do while not at home it was totally unacceptable.\n\nThe second part is that nothing of real value runs on Honeycomb. I tried quite a few popular Android games only to discover they weren't available for the tablet. Considering these ran on a jail broken Nook Color this is a major problem. On top of that most of what's on the Android store isn't made for Honeycomb and scaling up to fit it, especially on a tablet designed for horizontal use, was more miss than hit.\n\nIn the end I returned both units and I'm waiting for the market to mature and Windows 8."}

The touch screen is very responsive. This was a worry, but any bugs must have been worked out. The Transformer really does turn this into a high quality netbook. When docked there is nearly unlimited power and the keyboard intergrates nicely with the tablet. (Keybord to be reviewed seperately). Came with Android 3.2. Cons: I can live with fewer apps than Apple, but no movie (Netflix or Blockbuster) or good TV (Hulu) keeps this from being 5 stars. Come on Asus, even the new Kindle Fire has Netflix. This is an Asus issue despite what others claim. Some programs are difficult to sort out, such as Skype, although this is probably user error.\n\nDon't buy one without also getting breakage insurance.  This computer seems a bit fragile, so it will give you peace of mind. I'm sure those of you who wait until Black Friday will get a better price than I did ($399) but I don't regret the early purchase one bit."}

BUT, what Ineeded was a USB port and the ability to edit my artwork and then transfer my revised designs to my PC.  The Transformer can do it once you get the keyboard.  I'm still practicing with my drawing and \"imaging\" apps.\n\nIn one review on another site, someone said the case \"squeeked\".  Absolutely not, no way Jose.  They must have confused it with something else.  This case is the highest quality of any tablet I've seen, in fact sturdier.  I love the metal textured back - totally solid and the highest quality I could imagine.  I actually purchased a Xoom and couldn't get the thing to perform for me.  Lucky me that I returned it after I researched and read reviews of the Transformer.  It's everything I'd hoped.  I have a business so it doesn't replace my laptop but it's SO nice to relax on the couch or even listen to select YouTube informative/teaching type videos before I take a nap (holding it on my chest).  The screen is fantastic, the e-mail works great, the browsing is so much fun, and on and on. I've had it for over a month.  Best Android, best tablet period as far as I can tell.\n\nI got the keyboard which is also of the highest quality - very solid and easy to use.  I'm very happy with the Transformer.  Yes, the best price I found was at Amazon.  A perfect transaction."}

I've also had the ipad2 since May but always felt it was lacking the full experience. I tried out the Asus with the optional keyboard for 2 weeks and loved the customization it offered. It was quick in response time however sometimes typing and backspace functions lagged. I realized that I wanted the sleek look and speed of the ipad with the customization of an Android device. Then I figured out that what I was describing was a laptop. I ended up taking back the Asus and keeping my ipad2. The lack of apps on the Google market was a negative also. The Asus did not feel as solid as the ipad and its battery life was not even close."}

I took it to work with full charge and at the end of the day was at 99% battery.  Pretty impressive.  Now I didn't do much but read email but was cool.\nNow for the not so great stuff.\nThe battery on both the transformer and keyboard was completely drained when I took them out of the box. They must have been on the shelf for a long time.\nThe version of honeycomb that was on it was out of date and was very slow especially web browsing.  I checking for updates in the settings but it said there was no updates.  What the heck?  I went to the Asus website and saw that it was several versions behind.  Again what the heck?  I had to Google on how to do a firmware upgrade.  It turns out I needed a microsd card to perform than manual firmware update.  What the heck?  Once I was able to get a micro sd card and perform the firmware upgrade, it then started to see other firmware updates and I did them.\nNow that I was up to date everything should be cool right? NOPE!!\nFlash support is great but it doesn't do high-def flash well.  On sites that does both flash and html5, the browser doesn't support html5 so I am stuck with flash??  i want html5 when available.  And there is no easy way of closing an app?  So many time the browser crashes and all I see are the tabs.  I have restart the tablet to clean;y quit the app?  This is the same of slacker and other apps. The calendar crashed on start-up every time.  I was never able to run the calendar app.  And this is a built in app!!!  I have the IOS products and was bored with them so I wanted to like android for all the reasons that people say.  Well you know what?  I gave up.  Sent it back.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I bought this item after a lot of research, hoping finally to find a viable alternative to an Apple product. Mostly, while iPads and iPods work perfectly and are wonderfully simple to use, I was tired of Apple controlling what I could and could not access (the well-known \"Big Brother\" element). I thought with Android Gingerbread we finally had a non-Apple alternative and bought this tablet based on user reviews. By way of context, I am an over-50 lawyer who works with laptops and desktops daily at work and uses an iPod, iPad and a Dell laptop frequently at home, and enjoy messing around with mobile devices enough to annoy my wife. I travel with my iPod Touch and use it in airports for email and websurfing and on planes for music, I also use it with skype as a phone whenever I can. In short, I know my way around computers more than many my age and enjoy using them, but am in no way expert at it.\n\nWhat the reviews did not say is that the tablet comes loaded with really nothing, in the way of apps, nor that accessing apps basically requires you to go websurfing and search, mainly to find only apps that are limited to Android cell phones, not tablets. There is no equivalent to the App Store icon on this tablet, or of iTunes, and so on - you have to google for apps and click on the choices resulting, many of which are not relevant. When you do find them, the download process often takes several steps and the download itself takes up to a minute compared to the seconds in which an iPad app loads. After an hour of trying, I was unable to find out how to download music, or even figure out how to easily navigate Android Market (which is basically just another website that leads you to other websites, not a \"store\").\n\nI do not need or want a device that makes me work that hard to figure out how to use it - I want it to be intuitive. This tablet is not. I conclude that the reviewers who liked it as much as the iPad valued the undoubted freedom Android gives you from Big Brother so much that they were willing to hassle (or enjoyed hassling) through the process instead of being directed to obvious and user friendly icons that take you right where you want to go. I guess in my case Big Brother is a lot less intrusive and irritating than a machine that does not seem designed primarily with the user's convenience in mind.\n\nOn the technical (hardware) performance side, I found little to criticize\nexcept (i) unlike iPad, when you power up the Asus it has to boot up like a fast laptop, it does not just come on instantly; (ii) I ran into some of the hinky response issues other reviewers have commented on, including the fact that not all links actually respond when you touch them on the screen and every website has to load for several seconds longer than the almost instant appearance of webpages on an iPad.\n\nBottom line the machine seems to work well and have some interesting features, but is basically too much trouble for me. I returned it."}

For me, it's a great toy for watching Netflix, surfing the web and playing games.  The mini hdmi port is also a great addition for viewing your movies or netflix on any tv.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I love it, it runs smoothly and if you add the ASUS dock, it's a hardware keyboard plus an additional battery! The MyCloud app that came with the tablet is great, you can control your computer with it (however, I'm still having difficulty pulling it off away from home).\n\nProblems is that you have to take some of its crashing issues in stride, MyCloud and the application needed on your computer to bring it all together, doesn't always work properly, especially if you attempt to take control via the internet. Also, the onboard music app is still problematic, you'll find yourself using PowerAMP if you have it (or at least trying it if you don't)\n\nThings to consider: The dock adds 2 USB slots (for data only, won't charge other devices) and an SD card slot (on top of the miniSD slot on the tablet); You have to turn the tablet off before you can charge; Do not expect the clock to properly synchronize automatically, that capability is reserved mainly for (cell phone) networks, so you're setting your own clock."}

Its charger is VERY quick (I'd say a couple hours and boom it's ready). Updates seem to come pretty quick if an Android release appears, so hopefully once Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0) is released, Asus will have one ready within a week or two! MicroSD slot, mini HDMI out... I wish it had a normal USB slot but that's what the keyboard dock is for if you buy it as well. My only gripes are the proprietary connector to charge it and the weak front webcam (seriously why can't we have the 720p webcams?!?!).\n\nAll in all, worth the $$$. And I'm sure its successor (the Transformer 2) will be just as awesome as the original...and maybe even better!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "We objectively looked at ALL the tablets.  At first thought I wanted the Toshibe Thrive b/c of its extended functionality.  Then considered the Samsung Galaxy 10.  Thrive has too many known defects and weighs too much.  Both Toshiba and Samsung have notoriously lackluster support.\n\nChoice came down to this and the iPad 2.  Obviously, I picked the Asus.\n\nBoy am I happy I did.  I love this device.  I really like Android Honeycomb - more than I thought I could.\n\nWhy this over the iPad 2?  It's a more functional, robust device.  We bought the dock/keyboard, which extends this from \"very cool entertainment device\" into the realm of \"seriously functional business tool\" (literally) in a snap.  The keybvoard is a must-have.  Use some of the $$ you saved by NOT buying the iPad 2 to get it.\n\nThe most common argument against the Asus (and all Android tabs) presented by the Apple fanatics is, \"Hah! you don't have 100,000 apps.\"  True, I don't.  But there are WAY more apps - seriously, like 50x more - than I'd ever come close to using in the Android market, and about half are free.  I don't care about 100K apps, I only care about the 30 or 40 that I've already installed on my Transformer.\n\nI bought the 16GB and just got a class 10 MicroSD card for $25, that gives me WAY more storage than I'll ever need.  And saved me $$.\n\nThis is by far the most versatile, equal (if not exceeding) the iPad 2 in quality.  We wanted GPS and you have to buy iPad 2 3G model to get a GPS chip.  Since we're not interested in a cell contract/bill for this thing, that was a waste in my mind.\n\nMy ONLY complaints are the slight edge bleeding from the LED IPS screen (yes same screen as the iPad 2 and covered with Gorilla glass for durability) and some screen flickering ONLY with the animated ice cube background.  The flickering seems to have disappeared with an update.  Edge bleeding is a by-product of the edge lit LED technology, and is common to all IPS screens (YES iPad 2's have some too, and just like the TF some units are worse than others).\n\n(PS - don't let anyone tell you different, Apple products have quirks and issues, like ALL computer products.  Don't believe me?  Read about the battery problems with the new iPhone 4s).\n\nI DO advise that you buy directly from Amazon (or some place where you can return it, ie not eBay) so that if you DO experience any of the issues that other people report you can return it - not send it in for repair."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I'm a professional photographer and I do all \"serious\" work at my home desktop.  That is a very powerful, custom built Windows machine.  Quite honestly, I don't see me using anything else for serious photo work any time soon.\n\nI also own a 12\" netbook for when I travel and go to meet clients.  It's fairly slim for a notebook, but it's slow, has a loud fan, and doesn't get great battery life.  Sure, I could buy a $1000 \"Ultrabook\", but I don't believe I should have to pay that much money for a decent computer to serve my simple needs.  What I would love to do is sell the netbook and use a tablet instead for my \"run about\" computer.  This is my starting point and where the Asus Transformer Tablet comes in.\n\nFor those of you who haven't used Android before, it's a whole world away from Windows.  I've been using the tablet for about two weeks now and most of that time has been spent just trying to become familiar with the Android operating system.  In that regard, I'm an Android beginner.\n\nOne of the things that really impressed me about this tablet was how fast it was.  This machine runs as quickly as most modern desktops costing 2-3 times as much and using 20-30 times more power.  All of this comes packaged into a chassis that's barely 1/2\" thick and has no fan.  The battery is obviously very small, yet battery life is 6-8 hours typically.  That's better than I've gotten with ANY laptop.  The sheer computing power of this machine won't match up to quad core Intel processor, but then again you're doing far less heavy computation with a tablet.  Tablets seem to be best for media viewing, not media *creation*.  Watching a video, great.  Creating and editing a video, not so much.  All of the apps I've used so far have been quick to launch and run responsively.  It's faster than my Asus 1215T netbook by a substantial margin - and that thing is an absolute power hog in comparison.\n\nPhysically this tablet is impressive.  At 10.1\", it's the closest you're going to get to a laptop replacement size at the moment.  The screen is gorgeous.  Colors are rich and vibrant while contrast and viewing angles are excellent.  There is almost no color distortion at high viewing angles.  Low end laptop screens are so much worse it's embarrassing.  Like all glossy screens, though, this thing shows finger prints with a vengeance.  Keeping a lens cloth around to wipe it off occasionally is a good idea.  Build quality is substantial.  The tablet feels very rigid in your hand.  I haven't performed any structural \"tests\" (ie: dropping), but for normal usage it feels much better than a cheap laptop (most are flimsy plastic).\n\nGenerally, my experience using the transformer has been positive.  The biggest hurdle for me so far has been the touch screen.  Quite simply, you don't have the precision with your finger tip that you do with a mouse - period.  There is no way around it.  This is not a knock against the Transformer, but more tablets in general.  For most normal size icons on the desktop, along with Android Apps, this isn't a big deal - as most of the controls are properly sized for tablets.  Where you'll run into trouble is when you're browsing a webpage (which was designed for use with a mouse) and you try to click on a small link.  You might get it right and you might not.  You'll probably find yourself zooming in frequently to able to accurately click on things.  Rather annoying.  If you can find an \"app\" in the market that will take the place of going to a discrete webpage, this is often in your best interest.\n\nAlong the same lines, expect your typing speed to be much lower than with a keyboard.  I can type 80-100 words per minute on a keyboard, but on a tablet I find myself pecking away with my index fingers like a beginner.  You get no tactile feedback on a smooth touchscreen as you do with a keyboard, so all of those typing skills you learned over the years get tossed out the window.  It will get better with time, but there is no way I'll be able to type as fast as I do with a keyboard.  If you plan on doing a lot of typing, I would highly suggest the keyboard attachment for the Transformer.\n\nI have a folding leather case for mine and while the case is a good idea (to prop it up for viewing, protection, etc), they have one critical flaw.  The opening on the cases tend to get too close to the edge of the screen.  This impedes proper selection of icons near the edge of the screen - notably the home, back, and windows buttons.  I find myself leaving the case off while at home.\n\nAs a windows user, I find myself having to start from scratch here with the software.  I've been using Windows for about 15 years and pretty much know what to download and install when getting a new machine.  With the Transformer, I'm having to start over again.  This should be scary, but it's not.  Rather, it's kind of exciting.  Only two weeks into the tablet experience and I'm already doing things which weren't possible with a Windows machine.  I'm keeping the Windows netbook for now, but it looks like it will be getting a lot less usage in the future."}

The design is stylish, and the buttons are durable and easy to press.\n\n***UPDATE*** ASUS is now charging for their free unlimited storage space that came with it.  You get TWO GB free now, which is comparable to Dropbox's free account.  I'm taking off 3 stars for taking away this feature AFTER they got us to purchase them.****\n\nThe screen is crisp and clear.  They all get fingerprints, but the texture seems a little better than the competition.  Either way, you'll want to buy an anti-glare, anti-fingerprint screen protector no matter what you get.\n\nFinally, there is the Tegra 2 processor itself.  This is my second one, running at the same speed.  It's worth saying that because of the built-in video features of the Tegra 2, there are certain games you just can't play with any other processor, and those are available in a separate \"Tegra Zone\" store app.  I cannot stress enough how great it is to see a tablet that so efficiently takes advantage of this feature."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "At the beginning I was a bit skeptical about the Wopad. So I researched a lot about this. Here are my findings before ordering and trying it myself:\n\n- Wopad USA is the name of the company who sells this Chinese tablets (don't get misled, as this is good quality stuff).\n- Android Tablet Best is the only official company licensed to sell Wopad tablets apart from Wopad USA themselves. So if you buy this through here (Amazon) you can feel completely safe and protected.\n- There are some reviews about this tablet online where you could see the characteristics and actually you will see all of them are positive (try YT for example, and some other websites ... just make sure you check the review for this Wopad i7/i8 versions and not for the previous ones).\n\nSo then I was able to test this tablet for 2 days and I was impressed. First of all, the design is really nice! And the functions, well, they are described already in the product details. About weight, it's not completely light but is not heavy .... It's fair for the dimensions, nothing to worry about.\n\nIf you are looking for an affordable, small and really good tablet this is the one to get. If you are looking for something more powerful, more expensive and bigger, you could look at some other products ... however for it's functions, performance and characteristics I would say this is one of the best Android tablets to get in the respective price range ($200 - $300)."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I've had my eye on this tablet for a while and finally decided to take the plunge and get one. I've had it for about two weeks now and couldn't be happier. I got the 32GB model along with the keyboard dock (which really sets this tablet above the rest IMO). This is now my go to device for home and work. The Polaris Office app that comes pre-installed makes it easy to view and edit any work documents I need on the go. The Super Notes app that also comes pre-installed is great for note taking. I have a 1TB external hard drive that I hooked up to the usb on the keyboard and transferred some movie and music files over to the Transformer. Took about an hour to transfer 5 movies and around 100 music files. I haven't experienced any lag, the graphics and screen quality are great. I'll be getting a screen protector to help reduce fingerprints. Sound could be a bit louder, but if you're using headphones it sounds great. My company has been contemplating getting our salesmen iPads to use on the road. Once I showed them this tablet, they all want it instead of the iPad due to the dockable keyboard and usb options. It took me a little while to get used to typing on the smaller keyboard, and there is a little bit of a lag while you're typing, but nothing too major. Overall, I definitely give this 5 stars and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great tablet at a decent price."}

But it also has qualities no portable computer has, like a 16 hours battery (with the dock) or the ultra fast boot. And being an Android based device is also a quality. I already have downloaded dozens of great apps, and there still many more to come, I'm sure."}

Well, don't buy it thinking that it will replace your laptop! You don't have a laptop? Then go buy one (preferably the Asus UX31) and avoid this. I enjoy this product because I feel the tablet works perfectly in tandem with the laptop. Yes, you may disagree with me but this is my secondary device.\n\nI will avoid the whole Apple 'closed-world' versus Android 'open world' debate as everyone has different needs, so the act of calling someone dumb for buying an Apple product is dumb itself!!\n\nIs this a good buy? Yes, it definitely is; however, you must understand that tablets are rapidly-evolving in terms of features and versatility, you definitely need to consider this fact before buying.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I'm a nerd.  Let's get that out of the way right now.  I grew up using and working with computers, I pursued a career as a computer repair technician and I spend almost every minute of my free time on a computer.  I love technology.\n\nBut I also live with severe social anxiety disorder (pre-existing condition, not a result of spending too much time with computers.  sorry, pseudo-psychologists, no fodder here), which inhibits me in telephone usage.  Meaning, I don't have a smartphone.  Until six weeks ago, I didn't even know what Android was, because I'd never handled anything that used it.  I left the repair industry five years ago, after being \"promoted\" to a deskside support position for a facility with 2500+ on-site clients, and before the smartphone/tablet boom began.  As a result, I was utterly in the dark about things of this nature, so I see a device like this from two perspectives, as an enthusiast and as a neophyte.\n\nComing from the desktop platform, I initially scoffed at the \"meager\" 1GB of RAM and 1Ghz CPU speed, the \"paltry\" 16-32GB of on-board storage and the \"tiny\" 10.1\" LCD.  I'd grown accustomed to big numbers attached to my hardware and a big display on my desk... and then I remembered that I used a PDA with a fraction of those specs and a laptop which wasn't much faster or \"better\", and realized that what I was looking at wasn't merely a phone with a bigger screen, or a scaled down laptop, but the evolution of computing.  20 years ago, I told someone that we'd have devices like these in our hands in the not-too-distant future, but until a few months ago, I just never noticed that we'd already reached that point.  The more I read about tablets, the more impressed and intrigued I was, and finally, six weeks ago, I convinced myself to take the plunge.\n\nI think what impresses me most about this tablet is how seamlessly the hardware and software are integrated.  There's a layer of abstraction, of separation, in using a \"normal\" computer.  You click a button, press a key, do everything through the proxies of input devices.  It's just how most modern OS' work.  You use the computer, but you don't interact directly with it, it's a usage distinctly segregated from the machine itself.  Android is different.  It's fundamentally different, even though it uses the same basic principles in many ways.  You interact directly with the tablet, without external devices to slow you down or force you to do things in a specific way, and that interaction is no different from what we, in our modern, high tech society, are trained to do practically from birth.  Push buttons and turn pages.  It's as simple as that with Android, you're pushing buttons and turning pages.  No need to search for your mouse pointer before you click something, no keyboard shortcuts to memorize, nothing to drag your eyes away from the screen, everything is right there, at the tips of your fingers.  Using a tablet is an entirely different experience from using a desktop, or even laptop, computer.  This is what blows the neophyte in me away, the part of me which is completely unfamiliar with Android and touchscreens (aside from primitive resistive devices, such as POS' and ATMs).  It's intuitive and intelligent, and it's... beautiful.  The \"click\" part of the point and click interface has been discarded, simplifying everything in such a manner as to make it seem like it should always have been done like this.\n\nThe nerdy part of me is thrilled with Android.  I've spent more than my fair share of time tweaking and twisting various iterations of Windows, Apple OS' and desktop versions of Linux to fit my \"needs\", but none of them ever approached the flexibility and simplicity of Android.  I've got a B70 tablet, one of the ones which can't be rooted (yet), but for the first time, I don't feel an overwhelming need to dig into the guts of the OS and change dozens of things just to make it work \"correctly\".  It already does everything that I want it to do, and every time I think of something new, I realize that it's already got that functionality built in or someone else has made it available as a third-party application.  Installing a program, an app, is as simple as visiting the Android Market or Amazon Appstore (or downloading a package (a .apk file)), picking what I want and letting it install itself.  Minimal prompts to slog through to get to the meat of the matter, no forced reboots, BSODs or kernel panics, no drivers to bother with, apps just install and work.  And the look and feel of Android, specifically Honeycomb, is magnificent.  It's not the haptic adaptive interface portrayed in Mass Effect or Minority Report, but it is a step in that direction and it's actually enjoyable to use and interact with.\n\nMy inner geek is also more than satisfied at how well this OS runs on the hardware.  Will it let me play Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Left 4 Dead, Mass Effect or Portal 2?  Nope.  But that's why I still have a desktop.  What I can do is almost everything else that I currently do, or used to do, with my other devices.  Video, music, note taking, mileage logs, reading books, catching up on news, weather reports, surfing, e-mail, spreadsheets, planning trips, indulging in amateur astronomy, timer, clock, alarm and even \"casual\" games and more than I can think of without making a list.  The Transformer has replaced my PDA, camera and laptop, and is now my default device for daily computer usage.  About the only thing I do with my desktop is watch television (Dscaler and a TV tuner card acting as a pass-through device for a DirecTV box), rip my DVD collection and play \"serious\" games.  Well, and write reviews like this, because I haven't adapted to the on-screen keyboard yet.  >.>\n\nWi-Fi connectivity is excellent.  I'm picking up networks all over my block, far outside of the range at which I should be seeing them, and where I do connect, it's stable and usable even at bar.  Battery life is at least twice what my laptop could ever achieve.  I conducted an impromptu test, running a two hour movie all the way through on a full charge and ended up right at 75%.  That was with Wi-Fi on, indicating that I should have 8+ hours of video time if I turn off Wi-Fi.  In sleep mode, with Wi-Fi set to turn off when the screen does, it consumes practically no power and can sit for days without being recharged.  The screen is brilliant, so much so that I keep it turned down to 25-33% for normal usage and only turn it up when watching videos or showing something to someone with vision problems.  Touch response precision is excellent, and it's almost too sensitive (tends to respond to the slightest brush or twitch, but that's as much me as it is the tablet).\n\nTwo of the main selling points for me were the GPS functionality and ability to charge via USB.  Other than going to work, grocery shopping or trips to the bank, I almost never leave my house, largely due to a fear of getting lost and having to ask someone for help to get home.  Having a tablet with fully functional GPS gives me a freedom that I've never had before.  I'll be turning 40 next year, and for the first time in my life, I'm actually planning a trip that takes me farther than a few miles away from home.  I dug through dozens of reviews before I decided to buy the Transformer, learned that \"assisted GPS\" was no less functional than \"true GPS\", and that people had tested the Transformer specifically and found that it worked as well as \"true GPS\", then tested it myself after I got the tablet.  With Wi-Fi turned off, I was still able to track as many as nine GPS satellites.  From my bedroom.  It works, it works without requiring a 3G/4G cell tower nearby, it works without being connected to the Internet.  So, while it is assisted GPS, it's not limited to only working if you meet the right qualifications or jump through the correct sequence of hoops.  It works, period.\n\nUSB charging was important to me because, if I'm going to use a tablet to enable me to go on long trips and camping expeditions, it had to be possible to charge it without being next to an AC outlet.  As with GPS, I spent a lot of time researching which tablets could be charged without a wall wart or other AC source, and it turned out that the Transformer was capable of USB charging.  It's only a trickle charge if it's plugged into a USB 2.0 port, and even that only works if it's turned off, but that also means it can be charged via solar panels or car cigarette lighter adapter, and that satisfies my second primary requirement for a tablet.  There were other tablets which accepted a charge through USB, but none at this price point, and that was my third specification for the tablet I was going to buy, a reasonable price.  The Transformer was the only one which met all three.\n\nIt's not all sunshine and roses, of course.  The Transformer isn't without its flaws.  The location of the power/data port was not well thought out, as it makes it uncomfortable to use while plugged in unless you turn it upside down or use it in portrait mode, and it makes finding (or making) a stand for the tablet a difficult process.  The power cord itself is far too short and thin.  The built-in microphone is also poorly located (really should be somewhere on the front, rather than on the right side).  The mini-HDMI slot and micro-SDHC slot are too similar in size and shape, and both located on the right side, making it very easy for a new user to confuse them (guilty).  My Transformer has a a few very small spots of clouding (what others refer to as \"light bleed\") on the bottom, and it does creak a bit if I give it a squeeze right above the power/data port.  Initially, in the first week, I would have also said that the screen not responding to touch and activating while in sleep mode was an oversight or flaw, but I've come to prefer that it doesn't work that way, as it prevents it from constantly turning itself on when stowed for transit or moved, which would impact battery life.  The IPS LCD is also prone to \"burn-in\".  It's not permanent (unlike old monochrome CRTs, or the ATM i use at the local grocery store), but it can be disconcerting to see.  The default wallpaper selection tool, the Gallery app, is horrid, just awful for setting wallpaper (use Wallpaper Wizardrii, it's free and works a thousand times better).  You can't remove the Google Search widget, it's bolted into the home screens, but that's a personal preference, not a flaw.  Um... the Water live wallpaper that Asus included doesn't properly register a level surface... and you can't completely get rid of some of the useless or unwanted bloatware apps without rooting.  I could probably come up with at least a dozen other minor quibbles, but on the whole, none of the things that I've covered actually impact the performance or usability of the tablet.  It's stable, reliable and versatile, and whatever complaints I might have, they're really little more than a list of \"things I would've done differently if I were making a tablet\".\n\nSome of my dislikes are likely to be addressed in the Android 4.0 update, Ice Cream Sandwich, which has been confirmed to be coming to the Transformer some time in the next few months.  It shouldn't be much of a departure from Honeycomb, based on what I've seen thus far, more of a change for phones than tablets, really.  I'm rubbing my hands eagerly in anticipation of it, even if it won't be much more than some minor improvements or new apps for tablets.\n\nSo that's my six week review.  Six of the best weeks of my computer-using life.  I've learned a lot, and rediscovered an enthusiasm I haven't had in over a decade.  Prices on other tablets have dropped quite a bit in the last month, some offering more features at a slightly lower price than what I paid for my Transformer.  I still check, a habit I developed after spending several months shopping around the tablet market, and occasionally, I stop and ask myself if buying this tablet was the right decision.  Then I look at what I'm holding in my hand, and that soft smile touches my lips, and I know that this was the only tablet I could have ever purchased.  Whatever issues I might have with it, however low prices on other tablets might drop, even if the Transformer Prime (the next version of this tablet) had been released the day after I bought this one, I just can't feel anything but joy for what I have now.  It's just that good, and better than anything I expected, wanted or thought I could get."}

GREAT PRODUCT RUINED BY BAD CUSTOMER CARE\nI have since had to return the unit for more repairs- failing screen, worsening creak, rubber feet falling out etc. the second RMA took just as long another month. I asked for a full refund and ASUS refused. Offered me a replacement - which turned out to be another refurbished unit! To top it off it took them another month again to send me a form saying I would accept a refurbished product and accept an extra 3 months warranty! What a joke 3months of a 12 month warranty with the manufacturer, 1/4 of the warranty oeriod for a product that was DOA! ASUS are treating the customer like dirt and ignoring waranty laws etc!!!!!!!\n\nIf not for the bad service above - Excellent product highly recommended especially for the traveller. With the dock it turns the tablet into the best laptop alternative on the market - I rarely use my laptop now. Just took it away on hols for 6 weeks and it was so so useful. SD slot and usb ports make it so handy. Can upload photos straight away and see if they are good. Can use a usb drive or hdd etc. And extra battery means you never run out. Price point is also awesome. Feels better then the closest rival at this price point - Acer which feels heavy, chunky and awkward.\n\nUnfortunately you don't get a variety of plug adaptors for the different regions - no other adaptors - Asus cheaped out here. Also the cable from the charger to tablet is very short - they should have doubled the length to make it more user friendly. Also wish that it was not a proprietary plug to charge - Micro or mini usb would have been better.\n\nDue to product demand and initial supply issues the quality control of the units were not so great at first - I bought this at release when you could not buy the tablet or dock. My tablet has the dreaded creak in the back sometimes (that you read about in a lot of early reviews). My dock unit also came with a faulty touchpad (DOA)which meant I had to send it back for repairs.  But the QC and build quality now is meant to be great. FYI Asus in Oz took forever to fix the dock and would not just replace it - Asus service pick up your act. Also it is an international warranty they tried to tell me it wasn't at first. Quality of units now is meant to be fine and I love mine.\n\nDesign is awesome. When docked it doesn't lign up perfectly always but I think that is normal flex for tolerances otherwise it wouldn't work. Mini HDMI vs Micro is kind of a pain because there are more cheap Micro HDMI adaptors etc out there but really this is nit picking. Would be perfect if it had the SD slot and the USB (or mini or micro) slot on the tablet itself as well as the dock, but once again nitpicking and size weight etc this tablet has the best all round specs stats etc. IPA screen is great - viewing angle is awesome as is gorilla glass, doesn't pop as much as the Galaxy screen but this is a better package. Micro SD is awesome too.\n\nNote when using the keyboard dock input for other regions eg. UK not US that some keys are switched around eg @ and \" - not sure why so just swap the keyboard input around in the settings. Also ASUS have been super quick with updates etc - faster than the other manufacturers.\n\nWish list: other colours eg black,\nmore accessories\ninclude a longer charger cable\ninclude extra region power adaptors\nUSB on tablet and SD too (but on the dock anyway).\n64gb internal version and 3g/ 4g (well 3g is now released but wasn't at first)\nFlash on rear camera.\nNow want to get the newer Transformer prime announced yesterday."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "There are plenty of people who have written lengthy detailed reviews.  I don't see a need to write another.  However, I felt it important to chime in on how much I love my ASUS Transformer.  Last year I got my wife the iPad and even got myself the iTouch, but I guess the rebel in me couldn't see getting myself an iPad too.  This the article from the International Herald Tribune sort of summed up my rebel sentiment, \"The Steve Jobs who founded Apple as an anarchic company promoting the message of freedom, whose first projects ...were pirate boxes and computers with open schematics, would be taken aback by the future that Apple is forging. Today there is no tech company that looks more like the Big Brother from Apple's iconic 1984 commercial than Apple itself, a testament to how quickly power can corrupt.\"  So, I wanted to opt out of the Apple world order, but I didn't want to screw up and get a piece of junk either!  I read about all of the tablets on the market jumping from one favorite to another (So glad I didn't end up with a HP Touchpad!).  Finally, I happened onto the Transformer.  I read all the Amazon reviews and I guess if I was like the guys who had to call tech support and couldn't get anywhere I would rate it 1 or 2 stars too.  However, right out of the box my tablet (and the keyboard) has done everything it is supposed to do!  Essentially it is a laptop, and then SHAZAM it is a tablet!  I have had it about three weeks now, and with the automatic updates it has only gotten better and better--I travel with it, watch streaming movies, type documents, take and send pictures, the works (well, I am not really a gamer, so I can't judge its gaming utility).  So far I have just two criticisms: 1, it is a bit on the heavy side (becomes most apparent when reading in bed and starting to doze) and 2, how do you develop a word processing program and not include spell check???  The tablet finally auto updated to have spell check, but when using the keyboard it is a pain to clip/ paste into another app to spell check documents!  I guess it is only a matter of time before that too will be corrected.  Other than that, I love it!"}

Let me give you a run down about this tab..first of all, I was buying it solely for school with a side of work and maybe some gaming in my spare time..( I have an xbox, so this really wasn't for gaming, but to get my mind off school, ie angry birds, TD games, etc\n\nSo for school, Im enrolled to WGU, if you're working full time without set hours, this is the school for you, check them out, nationally accredited non profit school(I get nothing in return, just wanted to pass the word along  Anyway I needed a tablet where I would be able to do my homework no matter where I am at.  And especially because my wife is always doing her homework on our macbook.  I went to the apple store to buy an ipad and I as I was playing around it with there were 2 red flags..first, I couldn't download my pdfs to the ipad from my school website, it would come back in a chopped format..aggravating..and second..it doesnt do flash naively (sp?) you have to download an app, like \"photon\" and run that app as your web browser to access any sites with flash..(interface was horrible, and when you ran into something with flash you had to click a 'lightning bolt' where the page would reload and you could see flash material, but it was still somewhat choppy, (even after I messed with the bandwidth) I asked the apple 'specialist' about flash and she told me everything is moving to html5..keyword people is MOVING!! how long will everything be able to be seen on an ipad for internet surfing (my theory, apple doesnt want you to have flash due to their itunes sales)..anyway, my school has alot of flash websites, so I thought that would be a move in the wrong direction..dont get me wrong, i love apple, I have an ipod touch, a macbook I just bought in july, I love the ios..but I don't feel the way some apple fanboys feel, I don't feel obligated to buy their products..The other thing is the pricing..I mean, I called on a listing locally to buy USED** 32g ipad2 with a screen cover and case for 600..I told the girl that I had 550 cash if she would take that..she said no, \"Im giving you a deal with the invisishield and smart cover for 600..well you can buy a new one for 600..but then it was a deal since you have to figure in tax, plus the case and screen would come out to be 743 (in utah  743!!! you might as well get a laptop!!! goodness!!!  So I bailed on the ipad due to no proper pdf from my school website (note: pdfs will most likely work from other sites or the ones you create from work, but it DIDNT WORK FOR ME..even with the 'specialist' next to me trying to figure it out  and the flash capability.  and of course, the PRICING!!\n\npricing, I bought mine at best buy bc I wanted it as fast as I could get it and didn't want to wait for shipping.  It costed me 399..so 424 out the door I think..I bought a roocase on amazon that I absolutely love for 25 and Im getting a shield on it today.  so with all those accessories Im still saving 200 bucks..granted I got the 16 g one, but it has expandable memory! so for another 25 you could get 32 g...we'll see how it goes..I haven't even put a dent in my memory..my music is all on my itouch\n\nfunctionality, this is a true multitasker tablet, its so easy when I do my studies..I have an app for my school, an app for my pdfs, an app for my etext, there is a button on the screen in the bottom left where you can push it and it pulls up your different apps and web browser with one touch..unlike the ipad where you have to back out and go back in different apps, the honeycomb has it down, I can easily be reading my textbook, switch to my evernote to write an answer down, then switch back without losing my place..and the BATTERY is amazing! Im running on this thing hard all day and it goes easily 2-3 days without a recharge..just follow the directions in the box, you will want to charge it 8 hrs before using it for the first time, then it run all the way down and charge it again, do this 3 times and your battery will be set!  It also has a micro sd card as well as a mini hdmi..havent tried either out yet..also comes with an optional keyboard which I *will not* be getting..If I wanted a keyboard I wouldve bought another macbook.  I like how versital the tablet is and would feel the keyboard would cumber it up..but thats bc I don't need it, you might, and its definitely an option\n\nlast thing, for those of you who don't know, asus will be releasing a new tablet called the transformer 2, I believe 11/7, I was going to wait for that initially until i heard that it will be 499 retail, but that wasn't necessarily the deal breaker for me, but when asus publicly announced they will still be manufacturing the 1st gen transformer at 400 I knew this one was for me, sure I passed up a quad core, but hey, for what I do it works perfectly, sure it doesnt have 4.0 android but I know it will be getting it in the next upcoming months..which Im not too concerned about at the moment anyway..\n\nso if you're looking for a great value, a snappy duo core processor with 1 g of ram and 16 g harddrive expandable, this has been great, the OS for android honeycomb is definitely unique and takes a minute to get used to..I have an android phone and picked it up relatively quick..Im so happy I saved money from not falling into lines of mindless sheep with the ipad and got this instead..make sure whatever you do that you research what will work best for you before purchasing something, there is definitely something for everyone in the tablet world and the asus transformer is for me"}

A lot of the Android tablets aren't that good for productivity either because they don't come with good office suite software or because their design is simply more entertainment focused. The Transformer comes with excellent software, including the Polaris office suite that works very well for most needs. The optional docking keyboard is also a great addition for productivity and helps extend the already impressive battery life of the tablet. This would be a good choice for anyone interested in picking up a reasonably priced tablet that can double as a good small laptop that also comes with free office suite software."}

It does have a slot for mini sd and installed a 32gb card. The one thing I don't like, which is only thing I can find, is that you can not move apps to the sd card. maybe in future updates this could be allowed, but not being able to makes my extra card some what useless accept to add music or my reading stuff to it.

Check out the forums on their website and you can clearly read the staff is best at sarcasm and NOT at solving problems.  The pad might be great for someone firmiliar with this type of computer.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "The Asus transformer is a well designed and well implemented Android Honeycomb tablet. I been using it for the past 6 months and this tablet truly delivers on every aspect of its tablet identity.\n\nThe tablet is so responsive that it has become my favorite computing device. Apps and games are very snappy. I prefer to browse the web on my tablet more than my laptop! Of course not all websites are optimized for tablets yet. Some websites do have their quirks. Multitasking is well implemented (thanks to Honeycomb). Switching between apps/browser etc is smooth and seamless.\n\nThe IPS touch screen is flawless, I can't imagine how the screen can be any better. The colors are brilliant and the brightness more than enough in most situations (including direct sunlight). Videos look crisp with this screen, perfect for watching movies/TV shows anywhere.\n\nRegarding the battery life, I'm happy to report it exceeded all my expectations. I have gone 3 to 4 days without charging it with average use and more than a week with light usage. With the keyboard dock, the battery life literally doubles(i.e 1 week of average use and 2 weeks of light use).\n\nThe only thing that bothers me sometimes is the power button which can need different levels of pressure to be applied to turn on the screen. Not sure what causes it though, sometimes a light press will turn on the screen, sometimes slightly harder press to accomplish the same.\n\nI would highly recommend the transformer to anyone who wants a snappy tablet with a beautiful screen."}

If everything worked great on it, this would functionally be better than the ipad as I think android honeycomb is miles ahead of iOS. However, this tablet has too many drawbacks.....the screen is not good at all. `lots of color bleeding and the resolution is poor when reading certain documents. It does play videos quite nicely though. I am returning it mainly because it does not connect as well to wifi access points. Even when my blackberry phone and other devices can browse over the same network, this tablet fails to connect and keeps saying 'obtaining IP address'.\n\nWhen it comes down to android honeycomb, this I would give 4 to 5 stars.\n\nI also viewed other tablets alongside this one and I must say that this screen resolution is poor even compared to the samsung galaxy tab and the sony tablet S. However, the transformer is functionally better due to its microSD slot and mini HDMI output. The sony tablet S also has microSD but no HDMI.\n\nI really wanted this tablet to work as I wanted one with the expansion slots and for a good price. But I guess you get what you pay for and cheap is not always good. The transformer is also a bit long compared to other tablets. This I don't like too much as in portrait orientation, the screen is a bit awkward. Its fine though in landscape.\n\nIf you want a reasonably cheap tablet then you can go with this one but don't expect absolute satisfaction from it."}

As the newness and excitment of the tablet wore off the browser crashing either got worse or more frequent.  The tablet has been unstable it freezes rather often.  After about 2 months the tablet would not charge I suspected it was the adapter.\n\nThe tablet and adapter were sent to ASUS warranty repair.  I told them that the tablet was unstable and the web browser crashed often.  They look at the TF101 and returned it to me with a note saying there was nothing wrong with it.  When they returned the tablet it came back with an obsiously different charger.  The charger they sent back was scratched up and not new like the one I sent to them.  Since there was nothing wrong with the tablet, I guess that it is supposed to freeze and have the browser crash?\n\nThe wireless in this tablet may be the problem?

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I purchased the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer Tablet back in June 2011. I had decided I wanted a tablet, but I knew I didn't want an iPad 2. I have nothing against Apple (I'm an iPhone owner), but I felt the \"closed\" nature of the iOS would limit the iPad 2's usefulness as a tablet. I was leaning toward the HP Touchpad, but its release was still months away and WebOS seemed like it would also be more of a \"closed\" operating system (we all know how that turned out). After some research, I decided to go with an Android powered tablet. I compared prices and reviews and finally decided on the Eee Pad Transformer. It was the least expensive Android tablet on the market by far at the time of my purchase and it just so happened to also be one of the best reviewed.\n\nI had some concerns that the build quality would reflect the price I paid, but any concerns I had were alleviated when I received my Eee Pad Transformer. It is simply a well built tablet. Yes, the back is plastic rather than aluminum and if you press hard enough it will flex a little, but why anyone would do that is beyond me. ASUS chose a nice, neutral color for the back and they also gave it a textured feel. The texture also happens to provide a better grip when holding the tablet, which helps mitigate the risk of having it slip out of your hands. The power/sleep button and the volume rocker all have a solid feel and offer a tight \"click\" when pressed.\n\nThe screen is the highlight of the tablet. It is an absolutely stunning IPS LED display with bright, vivid colors and sharpness that rivals the iPad 2's display. In some ways, it's even better as the Transformer offers a higher resolution than that of the iPad 2. Multi-touch gestures work just as you'd expect and touch input is very responsive. ASUS used Gorilla Glass for the screen, which is a highly scratch resistant type of glass. As such, you could technically go without a screen protector if you're the type of person that hates having them on your electronic devices.\n\nOne of the notable advantages of the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer is the Docking Station (sold separately). The Docking Station not only recharges your tablet, it actually extends the battery life for another 10 hours or so. In addition, it doubles as a keyboard with a trackpad so the Dock essentially transforms (hence the name) your tablet into a netbook. ASUS has stated on numerous occasions that the Docking Station will be compatible with future ASUS products, so it is not a \"one and done\" add-on. This was one of the key selling points for me over the other available Android tablets.\n\nAs with any product, there are of course a few areas that could use improvement. The front edges of the Transformer are squared off rather than tapered and while this gives it a clean cut look, the edges can dig into your hands depending on how you hold the tablet. Also, the Transformer is a little heavier than other available tablets. Granted, it's not much heavier, but the difference is noticeable after prolonged periods of use. NVIDIA's Tegra CPU offers acceptable performance in most situations, but it can chug at times. This is especially true when running multiple apps or loading Flash content. Finally, I wish the Transformer had a removable battery similar to the Toshiba Thrive.\n\nBottom Line: If you're looking for a tablet that offers the iPhone experience on a bigger scale, the iPad 2 is for you. If you need a device to run Windows programs, a netbook or low-end laptop might be a better choice. If you're looking for the best Android tablet currently on the market, look no further than the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer."}

When in my lectures I am unable to view the online powerpoints and discussion notes, and I cannot comoplete my online homework.  The tablet does not allow me to view my pop up questions and quizes and it is impossible for me to type up my essays because the Polaris Office application does not let me format my papers to the required formats and I cannot afford to buy an app for every necessary process on the \"college budget.\" I have also had numerous issues with putting word documents onto a flash drive, I either cannot transfer the file, or the file will transfer with no data and a blank paper.  It is really irritating because I have to go through a process of changing the file format on my desktop computer to be able to simply transfer to a usb drive to print a paper since I cannot print from this either.\n\n  I have not once been able to type a paper (because the touchpad on the keyboard is so sensitive) without the cursor relocating to another section of the papper and messing me up.

The next generation is around the corner, reports just out that the Asus Tranformer 2 will be released November 7.  And the price has officially been confirmed.

To me that is worth waiting a few weeks for and spending $100 more on. That said, with three and a half weeks until the newer model's release, it is at least worth it to me to see the final specs on the newer version to compare the two.  And the price on the current model, being then a generation behind, may drop further, be part of a gold box deal, etc.  The choice though would be up to you all though as to whether to wait and see or buy this one.

It's unclear whether the Prime will have Honeycomb or Ice Cream Sandwich at launch.\n\nJust like the original Eee Pad Transformer, Prime will include the option of purchasing a keyboard dock to emulate a clamshell laptop form factor. Asus CEO Jonney Shih revealed the new device during the AsiaD conference in Hong Kong, and the company plans to officially launch the tablet Nov. 9. Asus did not say if the Prime's official unveiling in three weeks will include information about pricing and availability.\n\nTransformer Prime\nThe 10-inch Asus Transformer Prime sounds like it will be an impressive device and may be one of the earliest tablets out of the gate rocking Nvidia's anticipated Kal-el quad-core chip for mobile devices. Prime also includes a mini-HDMI port, SD card slot, and Asus claims the device has a 16.5 hour battery life when connected to the keyboard docking station. Asus did not reveal a number of specs, including screen resolution, a complete list of ports, storage, memory, processor speed and connectivity options. The Transformer Prime has an aluminum finish similar to its new Zen Ultrabooks.\n\nAsus' sneak preview of Prime follows the company's release of a Transformer Prime teaser trailer on Wednesday, when the device was referred to as the Eee Pad Transformer 2. The trailer doesn't discuss the specs for the new device, but it does give you a sense of what the Transformer Prime will look like. You can check it out below.\n\nShih also discussed Asus' upcoming Padfone, a smartphone that can connect to a tablet shell. Shih said the company's current plans are to launch the Padfone in early 2012 running Ice Cream Sandwich.\n\n[...]\n\nEDIT NUMBER TWO:  RELEASE DATE ANNOUNCED TRANFROMENR 2 (CALLED TRANSFORMER PRIME). AGAIN, NO LINK POSSIBLE, BUT JUST GOOGLE TRANSFORMER PRIME AND LOOK AT THE NEWS SECTION.  I AM SO GETTING THIS ON THE 9TH:\n\nAsus Eee Pad Transformer Prime To Launch November 9th, Followed By \"Hero Products\" [Asus Strategy Slides At Investor Conference Spill The Beans On The Transformer Prime's Launch Date, Also Hint At \"Hero\" Products To Come Next Year]\n\nPublished on TFTS by Steve Andersen, 31 October, 2011 at 1:28 pm\n\nThe folks at Asus have tipped their hand in regards to just when the Transformer Prime tablet is getting its release date, and as it turns out, it's a lot sooner than you might have expected. The current word says the Transformer Prime tablet will launch November 9th, but it's not the only item Asus has in mind to launch.\n\nWe've all been looking forward to hearing more about this one, the newest version of the tablet that's actually gone toe to toe previously with the iPad and not come out badly beaten in the process. Even better considering that the Transformer Prime is set to be the first quad-core tablet, as well as pack in plenty of other great features like a gig of RAM, 32 gigs of storage and a 10.1 inch display. And, based on a slide from an investor's conference, the launch date is indeed right around a week and a half out, which is going to give it a pretty good place indeed to walk into the holiday shopping season as what should be the first quad core tablet. But what's particularly interesting here is that that same slide also tipped off a couple new products set to emerge in 2012.\n\nRead: Asus Eee Pad Transformer Prime To Launch November 9th, Followed By \"Hero Products\" [Asus Strategy Slides At Investor Conference Spill The Beans On The Transformer Prime's Launch Date, Also Hint At \"Hero\" Products To Come Next Year]  TFTS"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "So, there I sat there thinking about upgrading my IPad or making the plunge to an Android tablet. I currently had a MACBook Pro laptop, a Windows 7 desktop (actually 5 in our household  and w Windows 7 Toshiba laptop to go with my IPod and Android phone. So, I am an equal-opportunity technology person. As I looked at the IPad2, I thought about the restrictive nature of the Apple IPod and IPad with ITunes, along with some of the basic features missing, like USB access,  extra SD Card storage, Flash support and a few other things. On the other hand, I love the polish and grace in IOS, if not the functionality in all cases. The same can be said for Android, so it was a tough decision which way to go. I knew from experience that the IPad would never replace my Laptop, if for storage and keyboard reasons if nothing else. I also was challenged streaming video from various sources in my house to my IPad. What I really wanted was a versatile tablet that could do everything fairly well, and certain things very well.\n\nI was already sold on Wi-Fi only, since my phone is there if I really can't find Wi-Fi in my travels, which is rare. I travel extensively for business, and find Wi-Fi in airports, hotels, even on the plane now, where I can't use 3G or 4G. So, after careful deliberation, I took the plunge. First I purchased just the tablet and fell in love with it. This was about 6 months ago, shortly after the units first became available. I immediately liked the feel, the size, the weight and the overall functionality of the tablet. The battery life was great, video streaming achieved through simple Apps like AMedia, Moboplayer and others with network playing capability. After figuring out how much funit was, I started looking at the functionality I use everyday, like email, calendars, etc., and found these compelling as well. So I made the plunge and purchased the keyboard/docking station, which gave me 2 USB ports, another SD card slot (full size) and doubled my battery life. Oh, and by the way, now I could dock my Transformer seamlessly and do 99% of the work I was doing on my laptops. Email is simple, using the stock email client and Maildroid, , which I found useful as well. The device came with Polaris Office, so I could look at and edit Word docs, Excel files, etc. I wouldn't necessarily create complex documents here, as the Office products have features I prefer to Android (or Mac Mail/pages) but suddenly I found myself taking out my laptop only once or twice every 3-4 trips.\n\nAfter six months of use, including a 7 foot drop onto my driveway that didn't even scratch the Gorilla glass, this device is my daily companion, for gaming, work, astronomy, and my daughter's favorite restaurant entertainer. My IPad sits lonely, only used by my daughter when I won't give her my \"T-Pad\".\n\nPros:\nLots of storage options, USB connections, incredible battery life, seamless keyboard integration, beautiful and tough screen,  stable OS, frequent updates\nCons:\nProprietary USB charging adaptor.

It seems quite responsive to touch, the display is reasonably sharp and is sharp from several angles.  The apps seem to work well for the most part.  The 'task switching' feature is very helpful. Battery life is good - Close to 8 hours of usage, and standby comes to 5 days!\ni did encounter some cons however.  Here they are:\n- The volume at max setting is too low for most video/audio on this tablet. Seems like a hardware design issue\n- When the battery runs below a certain threshold, even if it's connected to the charger, it continues to warn battery is low and does not indicate it is charging.  A power cycle is required to 'recognize' the charger and say it is charging.\n- When typing from the on-screen keyboard, when the cursor is positioned using the 'green' tab, sometimes the position of the cursor is offset from where the typed character appears on the screen. This happens quite often, though.\n- Lastly, the voice recognition on this is not as good as it used to be on the Motorola Droid phone i have. Maybe due to mic quality!\n\nOverall, good device to have."}

IT was just what we were looking for. It seemed to be much more portable than the netbooks, lighter in weight and faster, with many more flexible options.  We looked around internet sites and decided on Amazon for their price and\nreliability."}

You can increase your storage if you buy a micro SD card for it. There is a slight learning curve on the android vs apple, but it's not to bad. At this point their isn't too many apps for the Android Honeycomb OS, that will probably be changing soon, but Honeycomb can run all the regular Android apps as well."}

The screen resolution is way sharper than another tablet I tried, and I think it's even better than the iPad and iPad 2.  Plus, for less money than an iPad 2, I could get the 32GB tablet and still have the option to expand the memory by adding a microSD card.  I've tried the Amazon Kindle app along with bunch of other apps like the Weather.com app, Evernote, and multiple versions of Angry Birds for my kids, etc."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Been using it for a month now, and I have to say it was well worth the money!  Metal frame, Gorilla Glass (I'd still put a screen protector on it but...), Asus quality, Android 3.2.1 (current as of this writing), nVidia Tegra 2 (one of the reasons why I went with Android instead of iOS), 10.1\" screen, IPS panel (GORGEOUS).  Its charger is VERY quick (I'd say a couple hours and boom it's ready).  Updates seem to come pretty quick if an Android release appears, so hopefully once Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0) is released, Asus will have one ready within a week or two!  MicroSD slot, miniHDMI out...wish it had a normal USB slot but that's what the keyboard dock is for if you buy it as well.  My only gripes are the proprietary connector to charge it and the weak front webcam (seriously why can't we have the 720p webcams?!?!).\n\nAll in all, worth the $$$.  And I'm sure its successor (the Transformer 2) will be just as awesome as the original...and maybe even better!  But if you're looking for a tablet NOW of the Android variety, you can't go wrong with the Asus Transformer.  Just...buy a GOOD case for it too."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Now that I have had the device for a few weeks I feel I can give an honest review. The device is overall ok. It fills most of my needs such as web browsing, email, checking scores, etc. The ability to switch between tablet and netbook is a fantastic feature which is what really swayed my decision. I have not seen many issues yet but here is what to expect.\n\nApps that are designed for phones instead of tablets will give unexpected results. A great example of a double issue is the MLB app. This app only shows in portrait and also does not play video (even though I have the subscription for MLB.TV) but plays audio just fine. I don't have this issue at all with my iPhone. It is also not just MLB but different feel with weather app as another example. It's quite annoying and just shows how some developers put priority of their apps on one platform over another.\n\nVideo playback is also just awful. I have yet to see a single video on the web that is not choppy. YouTube app works (at low resolution) but that is about it. The processor power is quite underpowered. Someday I want to be able to watch a Netflix movie (or MLB stream, or how about an embedded video on a website) on the Transformer by either the app or the web. Maybe the Transformer 2 will fix that with the new chip?\n\nI use the browser that came with it and also loaded Firefox. Both have room for improvement and one giant step is to not notify itself as a mobile device (or give me an easy option to change it). This device has flash, it is a 10\" screen, it has an external keyboard (for those with the dock or Bluetooth one), it should have little issues (and it often doesn't) displaying the \"normal\" websites. I didn't order an iPad because I did not want an oversized iPhone that can't make phone calls. That was the point of the Transformer, it's a netbook and a tablet.\n\nLike others, on black screens I see light bleed on the bottom left edge. It is not horrible but you do sometimes get distracted by it (playing a game with simple background in the dark will show it).\n\nWhy provide built in GPS on a device that has no 3g without including even a cheap navigation app that stores map locally like CoPilot (Standard for $9)? I would imagine Asus could get a simple one with local maps from someone for a great price, charge just a few bucks more for it on the sale price of the device itself (but less than what you can buy on Android market) and make the GPS more usable on a device without 3g network capabilities.\n\nSo I gave this a 3 out of 5 for the following reasons:\n- I knew about screen bleed beforehand so little impact against rating\n- Video playback dropped it one star as I did expect that to work much better\n- App immaturity on Android over iOS lost .25 star (one would expect the same app work/look the same)\n- Web browsing experience lost .5 star as was expecting it more laptop like than smartphone\n- GPS function lost .25 star as there are workarounds (buy CoPilot, cache trip, etc.)\n\npros: portable, great battery life, built in GPS, dock/keyboard, acceptable camera\ncons: video playback lacking, Android apps can be immature, operates as mobile device\n\nWould I recommend this, maybe. I say that as rumors on Transformer 2 sounds like it may fix some of the bigger issues (video playback being one of those). If you are just reading email, surfing YouTube, Facebook, etc... this device will cover you with little issues. If you are looking for the laptop replacement, wait for the Transformer 2 and even then wait and see how well it works."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Please note the update at the very bottom...\n\nI love this product so far.  Haven't had it too long, only 6 days, but I have used it extensively.  I only left out one star because of the power cord problem.  If you search this problem online, you will see I am not alone.  Will go in detail below.  First the Pros.\n\nPros:\nThe look and feel is right up my alley.  You can have your own opinion here, but there is an ipad2 in my household as well.  The ipad is slightly lighter and more geared for anyone to pick up and figure out how to use it.  However, the Asus is still very light and very comfortable to use either docked to the keyboard docking station (sold separately) or as a stand-alone tablet.\n\nThe touch screen is very responsive with 10 point touch simultaneously.  However, as with most high gloss screens it does fill with fingerprints quickly. Picture quality is top-notch.\n\nDual camera is great and works with the free Skype app with only minor glitches.  This may improve with a Skype app update. Front camera isn't the best quality, but still looks great.  Rear camera is much nicer, but still not the best camera out there.  But this is common on pretty much any tablet including ipad2.\n\nThe docking keyboard is very nice and works flawlessly for me so far.  I've used it quite a bit.  I read some reviews of things not being quite right, but I have had zero problems.  The USB slots are amazing and show the device in the lower right of the screen.  And you open the files with the included File Manager in the Apps portion.  You can select files and copy them over to the Transformer.  I copied movie files (Xvid .avi) and MP3's.  For the video file to play I had to get the free app for video codec.  Worked like a charm.\nThe Micro SD card works great also.  I used a 16 GB Kingston card at class 4.  However it does support 32 GB.\n\nConnecting to Wifi has been so simple.  Not sure what else to write about that.\n\nAndroid version is 3.2.1\n\nBattery life has been great.  Haven't done any full tests on it to find out how long it goes before dying.  I don't have the time to sit there and clock it.\n\nI haven't tried the cloud service yet but sounds nice.\n\nI haven't tried connecting to my Windows 7 computers either but looks great from videos I've seen on Youtube.\n\nI've had no problems with apps.\n\nYoutube runs smoothly, and same with Flash.\n\nI know I'm missing a lot here, but it is so sweet.\n\nNow to the cons:\nI feel it is important to note anything I don't like about the product before I write reviews, but I will update if I need to add any cons, or retract any.\nAfter I let the Tablet and docking station discharge completely for the first time, I plugged in the charger to the wall and plugged into the docked device (when docked to the keyboard, you plug the power supply into the docking station and it charges both.  Well I noticed the charging indicator light was not lighting up.  I thought maybe it was due to discharging completely so I let it go for an hour.  I looked again and still not lit.  I read reviews on this and saw to disassemble the connector and reconnect it, and it still didn't work.  As a last resort I saw to put the whole adapter (just the part with the wall prongs, not the USB cord part) into a ziplock baggie and place in the freezer for a while.  I had it in there for about 45 minutes, took it out, plugged it in with fingers crossed.....and it worked!  Bizarre yes.  A shame that so many people have this problem.  Some even returned the whole Asus Transformer for a refund.  I don't see it as a major issue just yet.  I have plugged the power supply in 2 times since then and I haven't had to freeze the connector again yet.  I did order a replacement at my own expense, which isn't what we should have to do spending over $500 for an item.  Asus should really look into this and fix the power supplies so it doesn't keep happening.\n\nIn addition to that problem, the power cord itself is sooooooo short.  Did I emphasize that enough?  SOOOOOOOOOOOOO short.  Bear in mind, adding an extension USB cable may result in more power related problems.  Use at your own risk.\n\nMy last con is that there isn't enough time in my day to use this product.  Not Asus' problem, but my own.  What can I say, I love it, even with the power supply problem, which I only experienced once so far.\n\nIf anything else happens, negative or positive, I will be sure to update ASAP.\n\n****Update October 9, 2011:****\n\nSo I've used this tablet over and over and still absolutely love it.  The problem that I mentioned about the charger has not happened again, only once.  I will still leave it as 4 stars because I know other have mentioned this also.  Also, I tried using a 3 foot USB extension cable so I had more give while charging to use the tablet, but it just doesn't work.  It charged it a little, but not fully.  So I took out the extension and plugged it in and it charged immediately.\n\nI haven't had any app problems.  Yeah, some are designed more for android phones and only work in portrait mode, but they still work.  I'm sure there are some out there that don't work on tablets, but I haven't experienced it yet.  I've downloaded a good amount of games, live wallpapers, and various apps and they all work great.  Sometimes running a live wallpaper can make the honeycomb desktop user interface run a little choppy, but it isn't that bad.  But if you use just a photo as the background, going from screen to screen is so smooth.\n\nI've played video clips online and downloaded movies and haven't had any problems either.  Just gotta make sure you use the right player and video codecs.  I haven't used Netflix.\n\nBattery life has been excellent.  And of course, using the keyboard dock with it makes it even better, but I explained that already.\n\nI have no regrets making this purchase.  If you think that Android is limited by having less apps, then maybe you should just stick with Ipad 2.  I have both in the house, and from using both, I prefer the Asus over Apple.  If you think there is more of a learning curve using the Android tablet over Apple, then you are really limiting yourself or your child.  Kids will learn how to use this easily.  It isn't that difficult.  Maybe older folks would prefer the \"ease\" of Ipad 2.  I just don't like having to use itunes to get stuff on the Ipad 2.  I like dropping and dragging files and using USB to transfer songs, images, etc.\n\nInternet browsing is very good as well.  Keep in mind that in the US, there is no 3G version of this tablet, just Wifi.  This was fine by me because it costs less for the device, and there is no monthly fee for a Wifi like there is for 3G.  I can use my Android phone's Wifi tether to get on the internet anywhere, so I had no interest in 3G.  Also, I just use the default internet browser, not Dolphin or any of the others.  Works fine for me.\n\nOh, I also used the HDMI connection to my TV and it worked great.  Just plug it in and it works.  Just have a long enough HDMI cable and make sure you have the right one.  Mini HDMI to regular HDMI, or whatever your input is.\n\nI also think the speakers on the Asus are pretty good for being so small.  Granted, you can't get the booming bass that a subwoofer can offer, but it is pretty good, and they are stereo speakers.  Holding the tablet with both left and right hands may block the sounds somewhat, so just keep the speaker placement in mind.\n\nIf there is anything else, I will update ASAP.\n\nUPDATE 11/23/2011..... OK, so I had this device for a good while now and I still love it.  I use it more than I do my laptop.  The charging problem that happened to me has not happened again.  So only once.  Maybe a fluke?  So my only gripe about the power issue is that the charging plug is really short.  I'm not sure if anyone has had success using an extension cable with it, but I figured I'd just leave it as is.\n\nAlso noticed  that when running a graphic intensive live wallpaper can make the scrolling from page to page very jittery and sometimes just hangs for several seconds before moving.  But that seems the case on any tablet running certain live wallpapers.\n\nAlso I'd like to note that sometimes switching between app games that don't have an \"exit game\" button doesn't close the app, but keeps it running in background causing the likelihood of crashing or locking up the tablet.  I noticed this especially when kids were using it and played a game for a few minutes, then hit the home button and tried another game, then kept doing that.  This bogs down the memory and the best option I found was just to power it down and start back up, or if locked, pressing and holding the power button for like 10 seconds to force it to reboot.  This is partly the fault of the app developers that didn't put an exit button, I think.  Or Android Honeycomb for not letting you easily exit the running apps from the running app button.  You should be able to close out the apps right from that screen when you see the apps that are running.\n\nRegardless, I love this tablet, but I am actually selling it to a friend at a fraction of the price I paid so that I can get the Asus Transformer Prime.  But it is still an excellent tablet and I do not regret this purchase.\nThe keyboard dock isn't necessary, but it is really nice to have.  If you are on a budget and still want this tablet, you don't need the keyboard.  But if you have extra money, I say go for it.  Or wait for another good tablet to come out with a built in USB port."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I lusted after the iPad since the first one was released, but never bought one. Couldn't justify it at those prices. This spring I wanted to watch videos at the gym (treadmill) and on planes, on a bigger screen than my HTC EVO phone or iPod Touch. So I shopped tablets in person and online. Quickly decided that the iPad2 was too limited as to input and too expensive. Shopped some Android tablets, and kept coming back to this one. At the time it was in such short supply that it was the top item on a product inventory tracking website, but I persevered and pounced on this tablet from another online source (I bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Asus-Keyboard-Docking-Station-for-Eee-Pad-Transformer/dp/B004U78628/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Asus Keyboard/Docking Station for Eee Pad Transformer</a>&nbsp;here at amazon).\n\nI haven't regretted it for a moment. I bought a 32GB microSD card here at amazon which I use to expand the total capacity of this tablet to 48GB. I keep my tablet loaded with movies. I don't use the keyboard dock a lot. I usually carry my Transformer in a case  -&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/rooCASE-Multi-Angle-Black-Leather-Folio-Case-Cover-for-Asus-Eee-Pad-Transformer/dp/B00547IQCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">rooCASE Multi-Angle (Black) Leather Folio Case Cover for Asus Eee Pad Transformer</a>&nbsp;- which protects it and also fits nicely in the book slot on my gym's treadmill machines.\n\nBesides watching videos, I read a lot of Kindle books on my tablet, keep up with my emails, and browse the web.\n\nI haven't loaded it up with tons of apps, but one I enjoy is Zfolio which links to my photos online (on Zenfolio). With the mini-HDMI port on the tablet and an inexpensive mini-HDMI to HDMI cable, I've finally been able to share my digital-only pictures of several foreign trips, with some elderly relatives who are not online but who have a nice HDTV. For that experience alone, I'm delighted to have this Android tablet. I really like the HDMI cable connectivity, which also works to view movies on a TV (though the higher-def movie file the better, of course, depending on the screen size of the TV) and just to display the tablet's desktop on a TV.\n\nA couple of months ago I had a problem with my Roku XDS device, which quit responding to its remote. I found and installed an Android app called \"Roku remote\" which turned my Transformer into a working remote for my Roku. It may not have been ideal but made all the difference between having a working video streaming device next to my TV versus having a little black brick sitting there.\n\nToday I dusted off the keyboard dock and paired it with the tablet. It immediately prompted me to download/install a firmware update for the dock which seems to have cured a typing lag I'd experienced when using the Polaris office app.\n\nBottom line: It's convenient, robust, handy, versatile, and I'm very pleased with this purchase. The only downside is the typing lag I experienced with the browser using the touch keyboard on the screen. Either I'm more used to it or it's been improved, maybe both."}

Like my android phone, I like the way it synchs all my Google based accounts upon sign up (gmail, youtube etc). It is so light, great battery life and charges relatively quickly. You need to charge and drain three times to get true sense of battery life. I took it to places where there was no wi fi and then used its reader application. Amazingly it had my old Kindle downloads from over a year ago synched there too, so I had something to read.\n\nI bought an iPad too over a year ago returned it because I didn't like being stuck in the Apple cul de sac; this device has broader uses IMO.\n\nI enjoyed the 'gallery' feature for pictures and videos from my phone; plugged the micro SD card from my phone into the tablet and upload photos easily from there and post online.\n\nThe quality of the videos I watched on youtube was really good - better than my laptop!

You'll need protective screens to keep the screen from smudging, and a good cover, and there is a wonderful and cheap flexible stand sold here on Amazon that works great with it too.\n\nThe long battery life (of course much less when you watch lots of videos) is a big plus, and the portability and beautiful photo/video quality."}

I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7\" which I like a lot, but I'm a content consumer, not a content producer. Mostly surf the web, read pdf docs, and kindle books, and watch youtube videos. If you need to write documents, or do homework I recommend a bigger tablet with a physical keyboard. Asus transformer is perfect for that."}

I never been an Apple devotee, so I've been waiting for other tablets to start to compete, that day is here.  It is fast, sleek and a dynamo...and it has Adobe flash so the Web experience is seamless. And here's the kicker, I bought the docking keyboard and now I have a fabulous netbook...I don't even know where my laptop is its been so long since I've picked it up.  Do your homework and you'll find this is the right Android tablet out there.\n\nBuy it! You'll love it."}

Also, had a first hand experience at a nearby store to check the look-n-feel for my personal taste.\n\nPros:\n1. Nice sturdy build and pleasing appearance.\n2. Very quick and seamless in terms of usability.\n3. Bright screen with properly saturated colours.\n4. Loads of connectivity options (particularly when used with the docking station (keyboard)).\n5. Highly customizable (as compared to iPAD2).\n6. Plays flash.\n\nCons:\n1. App-market for android is lame when compared to Apple's app-store, though it's growing.\n2. No in-built ability to group apps together (but many free-apps available to do so).\n3. Had a bit of geeky feel when used extensively.\n4. Some apps crash when used heavily.\n5. 3G-enabled version is not available everywhere.\n6. Minor bugs (check forums) - but did not affect me in using the Tab.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you are not completely awestruck by the looks of iPad2 and would like to buy a decent tab with some meat (processing-power in this case) inside and also not too heavy on your pocket, then this is the product for you."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I've been using my transformer for two months.  I'm very impressed.  For comparison, I own an iPad 1 and a Dell Streak 7 as well.  The transformer is my favorite.  I use the transformer as a laptop at work Monday-Friday and a tablet on the weekends.\n\nHere is what I was looking for:\n- Light weight\n- Great battery life\n- Supported remote desktop to my Windows machines\n- Clear screen (with better DPI than my iPad)\n\nIt has been perfect in all of the above.  It is just under 3 pounds with the keyboard.  I keep the tablet on 24/7 and only charge it 1-2 times a week.  I use Remote RDP to access my windows machines.  Finally, I love the 1280x800 IPS screen.  It is noticeably better than my iPad's screen (which is decent itself).\n\nNow, I don't try to do serious work on the transformer.  Mostly I use it to catch up on business email during meetings.\n\nIt has lots of features that my iPad 1 wifi doesn't have (microsd card, GPS, front and rear cameras, etc).  The microsd card is really nice, but I rarely use the other features.  I also love that we can play old school NES games on the HDTV using a wii remote (bluetooth) and hdmi out.  Very cool.\n\nIMO, at $400 it is a better value than the iPad.  It costs less, but provides more options.\n\nThe one negative, is that Android doesn't support Cisco VPNs out of the box.  I was able to get it working by rooting my device and installing a custom kernel, but I shouldn't need to do that.\n\nA second negative is I'm not totally sold on the 16x9 aspect ratio.  It is nice for movies (netflix).  I really like it turned horizontal with the keyboard.  But, I think I prefer the iPad's 4x3 aspect ratio for viewing web pages.\n\nNote: I received a dock and tablet from the B60 series and haven't had any battery drain issues.  I leave the tablet and keyboard docked together 24/7 and the battery can easily last me a week with light usage (on 24/7)."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I currently own a first generation iPad but I really wanted something a bit more powerful and flexible so I demoed a variety of honeycomb tablets. Although I'm not a huge fan of the look and feel of honeycomb's gaudy, Tron-inspired interface, the truth is honeycomb does provide a more well-rounded tablet experience than iOS. Multi-tasking is great and notifications are somewhat reminiscent of the recently departed webOS, and that's a good thing.\n\nAdd in the ever-growing catalog of apps in the Android marketplace, the wide variety of hardware choices, access to industry standard ports and removable storage and I was sold. In the end, I settled on the ASUS Transformer mostly due to the optional keyboard dock. I felt, as a whole, this tablet provided the best combination of performance and features for the price.\n\nAnd, if any of the Transformers I received worked as intended, I'm sure I'd be really happy with my purchase. Trouble is, the two I've received so far each suffer from a handful of widespread bugs. My first tablet's case creaked and flexed, causing distortion to the LCD if I held it the wrong way. The screen was also slightly yellow and noticeably dimmer than my iPad. Unfortunately, it also had the \"one speaker is louder than the other\" issue.\n\nThe second tablet had a brighter screen but the capacitive sensor was clearly visible even at 90% brightness. It created a sort of faint grid pattern across the entire screen that was most visible on light and dark backgrounds. Granted, I'm a bit nit-picky about such things but even my wife (who's been known to use her LCD monitor at the wrong resolution) noticed it right away.  Since that tablet also had the speaker issue (it was worse than the original) I opted to send that one back as well.\n\nSo now I'm left wondering, do I try a third tablet or just give up altogether and buy another brand? It's a shame too because if the Transformer worked properly, I know I'd love it. It's a fantastic tablet.\n\n*** Update ***\nWell, I decided to try a third Transformer. This one's got better speakers, a brighter screen and no creaky case. However there's a dull, white line running down the righthand portion of the screen. It comes and goes intermittently but I know that can't be good. Sad to say, I think I'm returning it for good this time. :-("}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Bought this tablet about two months ago now and have loved it ever since. I am an avid computer user both desktop and my laptop comes with me everywhere. I wasn't really sure I would have too much use for this device until I figured at worst I could use it as an e-reader. I decided not to get the keyboard as I didn't see the need to have essentially a second laptop, but i may be changing my mind about that.\n\nTurns out that I end up using it almost as often as my laptop. Great for reading and my usual perusal of forums and news sites (especially the news/forum specific apps available on android). This review is meant to be for the tablet and not android, so I will not be mentioning anything about its ease of use. Not having used any other tablet, it is a tad difficult to compare to others so I will be as objective as possible. Here is the lowdown for what has stood out to me about the tablet:\n\nGood:\n\nBattery Life - I was very surprised to find out that it is actually around 5 hours of real battery time maybe even more. You always read the manufactures claim and it is never close to it, but this one is pretty damn good. I was delighted that I could actually use the device for a good while, put it down and come back to it for more later. I am basing my happiness only on my past android phones which seem to die after an hour of real use (online activity, gps, etc). I am fully aware of how to extend my battery life on my android phones, but imo it shouldnt be me that has to make adjustments. The damn device should work when you need it to and not have to plug it in every damn chance you see an outlet and I feel that this tablet does just that. It works when you need it doing anything you want to do and not having to jump through hoops just to be online or watch a movie for a while.\n\nScreen Brightness - My battery life probably has a great deal to do with this. The screen is extremely bright, so much so that I never have the screen brighter than the lowest setting (unless outside). Even inside, especially at night I feel the screen is too bright on the lowest setting and have downloaded a market app to darken the screen even further. While I know some people prefer their screens to be on the brighter side so they can see every minute detail, I am not one of those people, but I feel that the screen is plenty bright.\n\nCharging - This is both good and bad (Ill list the bad in the bad section). I have never had a device charge so incredibly fast before. I can have it down to 10% and it will be back up to near 100 in an hour. I wish my phone was that good...\n\nThe Bad\n\nCharging - Unfortunately, the charger itself is extremely difficult to find a replacement for. I have not needed to actually replace my unit, but I like to have a couple chargers laying around in different spots where I most frequently am to just plug it in when it isn't in use. The provided charger provides 11v to the device which is probably why it charges so quickly. The device will NOT charge on 5v which is what a standard USB 2.0 slot provides. This means that ALL those car chargers (cigarette lighter plugs), your computer usb slots (unless you have 3.0) and wall chargers that you use for your other USB charging need are all useless for this. You can make one of your own, or buy one from asus which is hella expensive but I'm hoping that other options come into the market soon.\n\nReally thats all that comes to mind about this thing. Everything else is pretty straight forward. It has buttons, they work. It has cameras, they work. It has Tegra 2 like everything else does. Overall I am very pleased with it. It's possible I would have been just as pleased with any tablet on the market, but I did want the option of the keyboard even though I didn't think I was going to get it."}

I have not been disappointed.  It is handy, easy to use and I have to fight my grandkids (6 & 9) and husband for it.  I've downloaded some neat games that we all love.  We usually use it detached form the keyboard, but the keyboard gives me a feeling of protection for the screen when carrying it around.  The keyboard is a little faster for typing emails and notes than the keyboard on the screen, so I would recommend the detachable keyboard.  The only ap I've been a little disappointed in is Skype - it doesn't have video capabilities on the Eee Pad yet.  I'm looking for it to be available soon!  I've only had it a few weeks, so I only expect to be more impressed as I use it more!"}

I love all the free apps that you can download.\n2) The fit and finish is outstanding with a dark brass metallic exterior finish that gives it a very high quality feel. It simply looks well made and high class.\n3) Great software included: the Polaris Office app included in the software allows me to open files I have on my laptop in my Microsoft offices folders. Makes transferring files between my devices easy.\n4) Great battery life of 9.5 hours!\n5) I bought the optional docking keyboard for $120. The added versatility is simply awesome! I can use the eee pad as a tablet most of the time. yet, when I feel like it, I can put the tablet into the dock and it becomes a netbook that allows me to use a mouse and type on a real keyboard. Also, the dock has a regular USB port that allows me to hook up to all kinds of external devices for games,for music(like an ipod), for transferring files etc. It makes it so easy to transfer files compared to having to use micro-SD card to do the job.\n\nAll in all, I simply love this tablet. It is an ideal tablet for everyday use and also a netbook when I want to use a real keyboard and mouse and when I want the added functionality of a netbook.

The Transformer really fills the bill. The keyboard dock is perfect for typing long documents and for viewing the screen without having to hold the tablet for hours on end. Although I do miss having a delete key, the keyboard has a similar configuration to my netbook. The device offers a variety of storage options - from a built-in sdcard, 2 usb ports and a micro sd card for storage on the tablet when undocked. I'm able to read content from my Kindle, pdfs, my recipes and other text documents with the help of a variety of reader apps. The Honeycomb operating system runs smoothly and I haven't had any problems or crashes. I was able to transfer all my podcasts via opml to the BeyondPod app and the videos stream very well. Audio is lower than I like but a small external speaker is more than adequate. Battery life is excellent. I can go three days between charges. I really ilke the simplicity of the Android OS. It's very intuitive and easy to operate. The only downside so far is that I cannot find a media player that can play my avi content natively. Some of the players are not compatible with Honeycomb and won't even install. I hope that someone will develop an app for Android as versatile as Media Player Classic that will run on tablets."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I've had the tablet a few days and have only hit three things that irk me.\n\n1) charging\n  The only way to charge this is by using the included charger. There is no charging off of a regular USB. You need the included 12V charger. Also there are no official car adapters that I saw from Asus.  I'm a little leery of going with a third party car 12V->USB adapter because it may not have proper power and noise filtering as automotive power is not constant and is noisy. I understand this tablet has a big battery and needs a 12V at 1A to charge but including a single charger is a bad move. It's problem just like laptops in that the manufacturers should include 2 chargers.\n\n2) Charging port on the tablet\n  It's not a common form factor. If it had been a barrel connector or something else I'd be alright with that. But the only way to charge it is with their cable and charger.\n\n3) Wifi\n  There are two things here. It's a single frequency. I wish it had 5 Ghz also. But it's only 2.4 Ghz... And I have not figured out the trigger factor, but in 48 hours of owning this I've had two instances where when I wake it, the wireless is unable to connect. It sits there trying in an endless loop and the only way out is to shut it down and power back up.\n\nBut the screen and speed of this tablet are incredible. There are a few apps that are not working nice on the tablet but those work fine on my MyTouch 4G."}

Why would I need more now, when I have external slots for expansion?? Save the $100 and spend it toward the keyboard. it is a VERY usable keyboard, with a ton of GREAT features, including multi-touch pad on board with a pretty usable form factor. Typing long sentences I find I need to adjust my hand placement a bit (I'll end up brushing the touchpad and filling text in places other than where I expected to be...user malfunction more than anything else).\n\nThe device is a TOUCH heavy...but, that's also because of the battery...both devices have batteries, and my initial charge has lasted from day 1 to day 6. EPIC.\n\nThe camera COULD have a bit better lens...but, it's a TABLET - not a camera, and it is outstanding as it is...\n\nMy only TRUE complaint is that when I am fiddling with opening and closing the tab, occasionally I wiggle the pad just slightly off the keyboard dock, and I have to press it down again to get the sync to begin using the keyboard again. I will gladly take that because of the ease to separate the devices...but it could be a bit easier to guide it into place and a tad more secure.\n\nIf you're on the fence...DON'T BE...I am in love with my transformer. Who wants built in 3G/4G anymore...myfi's allow you to upgrade devices as much as you'd like without contracts. Asus has a ton of very clean functional services - like the year of free cloud storage - that make this tablet even more amazingly usable.  I drank the Kool-Aid on this one."}

I researched a fair amount on all the android tablets out on the market, and I had initially had my heart set on the Samsung Galaxy Tablet, but the price was a bit steep for the 32GB and I was disappointed with the lack of expansion options/ports on the device. I looked at the Toshiba Thrive tablet as well, because it had a ton of options for expandability/ports, but didn't like the design or feel. I hadn't even really done any research on the Transformer, but went to Best Buy and was recommended it, and was absolutely blown away. It felt great, looked great, and had everything I wanted/needed it to do.\n\nThe keyboard attachment is magnificent, and a must have. I got a 32GB micro-SD card too to use with it, and it's pretty seamless. I was not familiar with Honeycomb at all, but was able to quickly pick it up and have had no issues using it.\n\nBy far this tablet met or exceeded every expectation I've had for it, and would recommend it to anyone that is looking at getting a tablet.\n\nThe only con that I can find with the whole thing is the lack of mobile broadband built into it, but for everything I need it to do, it wasn't something I needed.

The features and functionality are unparalleled in anything else I could find.  Personally, I do not use the keyboard all that often, but its nice to have.  Check the specs on what this offers and I think you'll agree its the best tablet you can buy.  The only minor critiques that I have is that it can be a bit of a battery hog if you leave the wireless on all day while not really using it.  I've gotten in the habit of just putting it in \"Airplane mode\" before I turn it off for a while.  I really don't need push email... I'm fine to make it wait until I'm back on the device to sync my email and what not.  With doing that... I seem to get about 3 days out of a full charge with what I consider \"moderate\" usage.  Also, currently SKYPE is not supported for video calling.  This is really a SKYPE issue, and one I hope they change.  You can use Google Talk for video conversations as an alternate.  Also the wall plug is a little bit short.  If you want to use it as a netbook and have it plugged in to be charged... you need to be real close to a wall outlet, or have an extension cord.  All very minor issues to me.\n\nSome of the things I really love - microSD card slot in Tablet, SD card and USB in Keyboard (sold separate), mini-HDMI out, front and rear camera, PolarisOffice which lets me view, open and edit basic office documents OFFLINE, android honeycomb os, the keyboard makes it a very functional netbook as well.\n\nOverall, I Love this thing and highly recommend it!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I've had my ASUS Transformer about 15 days and have not regretting buying it for even a second.  The screen is shockingly crisp and the Honeycomb version of Android is a real pleasure to use.  The Android market place is chock full of useful apps although a majority of them are formatted for phones but Transformer resizes them in a way that makes them seem like they were made for a tablet although some don't scale well.  I found the Netflix apk that works with the tablet (oddly NOT in the Android marketplace??) and bought a mini-HDMI converter to display netflix on my 42 inch LCD TV and it looked great!  I also found that if you buy a USB 3.0 extension cable, it will provide the power from the wall wart to the Transformer's USB cable so that you can charge and run it from more than 2' away from a wall jack.  I'm still not sure that I'm getting 19 hours out of the battery but then again, I've never sat and ran the screen for that long.  In \"sleep\" mode, it's not really asleep as I always have email waiting when I turn the screen back on so, if you count those hours of it sitting in sleep mode while I sleep at night, then yeah, the battery life is excellent because it doesn't lose much charge at all at night even though I run it with WiFi on at all times.\n\nThis beauty isn't without some CONS though.  For one, if I set my Wifi to turn off while the screen is off, it does this crazy connect/disconnect dance like it can't attach to my wifi anymore.  I found from Googling, that some folks believe that's because the wifi lease expires but I don't believe that for a second because 1) I've had it happen after turning it off for only a couple of hours and 2) It happens even though I've configured the Transformer to run in static IP mode.  I believe this to be a glitch in the firmware.  To get around it, I just leave the Wifi on at all times and it hasn't happened since and the battery life doesn't seem to be hit too hard.  Actually, that's the only bad thing that's happened.\n\nI have NOT seen any screen bleed or anything I can't live with.  Problems I have had are more problems with Android than anything else like apps that just don't exist that you'd expect (Netflix (you have to go find an unauthorized version of it), Facebook, Skype, etc) and some of the apps are buggy and the Android Marketplace has some issues like when you go to download/install an app and it just sits there until you go back and click it again.. and again...  It does eventually does work though, and sometimes even on the first click!  Those are my only real complaints though and, like I said, are more with the environment than the Transformer itself.  It really IS a great tablet."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I compared a fair number of tablets. I realized that I liked some of the physical designs of other tablets better than the transformer, but I picked it anyways.\n\nWeaknesses I have found in the tablet:\n1. Edges not rounded. Humans do not interface with 90 degree angles, so designs should account for this.\n2. Every once in a while the memory runs out from running apps and shuts down applications. Hasn't been a real problem, but it has happened.\n3. Only a proprietary charger can be used. Typical, but there aren't any less expensive alternatives out.\n\nWhy I got it anyways:\n1. I am clumsy. Any tablet I chose would be in a case at all times with a protective screen.\n2. The optional keyboard that extends battery life. This extends the functionality of the tablet in productivity and time available away from the wall socket.\n3. Swype. This is the best reason for me to choose an android system over an iPad.\n4. Polaris Office. Much better than the Docs2Go.\n5. Asus. Although some complained of customer service, I have never had anything but a positive experience from the company. Absolute professionals in handling any issues with the products I have purchased from them.\n\nOn a side note, I have used 2 sheets of paper at work since this purchase. I was previously using several sheets per day. The versatility of the tool really keeps me engaged with tasks and never forgetting to adjust something (as I can stay connected and make changes in a meeting).\n\nLong and short. It isn't perfect, but I absolutely love this equipment. Get a good case and fitted protector."}

It is very good at handling whatever is thrown at it, apps, books, movies, web, etc. I still recommend having an actual laptop or desktop computer besides, but I have found this thing to be very useful for homework. I can have files open on it without costing me in ink or paper, and i can read textbooks with links to definitions. It is a real aid to learning, as long as you can control your urge to play games on it. Awesome product, have never once regretted the purchase."}

HP, about 7 years back put a full query keyboard as a dock to a windows 'tablet' type PC and it was a GREAT idea.  sure the keyboard didn't hold the screen stable and it wobbled a bit as you typed... but it was a GREAT idea.  then you could close with the screen on, or pull it off an run.  why it took 7 years for a mfr to get back to the idea boggles my mind.  sometimes you want a keyboard, sometimes you want a screen and portability.  ASUS got it right here, sorry to the other mfrs who've been in this game for years and failed to understand the need.  this is a win, and honeycomb OS is getting pretty solid as a tablet os."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I'm generally loving my Transformer.  It's a heck of a bargain, even at full price.  For my needs, it matches or beats the iPad and the other Android tablets I've had an opportunity to play with.  Here's a break-down:\n\nPros:\n- The screen is fantastic - bright, wide viewing angles, higher resolution than an iPad and most non-Honeycomb Android gizmos.\n- Adding widgets for email, calendar, news feeds, etc. makes it quick and easy to catch up on everything I need to know in the morning (or running from meeting to meeting at work).\n- The included software (Polaris Office, various e-readers, etc.) works well, and everything else I need has been easy to find on the app store.\n- In general, this is the best book / comic reader device I've ever used (and I own several at this point).  It also handles weird media types like MKV without too much fuss (get mVideoPlayer if you need subtitle support, though).\n\nCons:\n- Exchange-based email accounts are busted at the moment in most Honeycomb 3.2 tablets.  If you're planning to use this in an office environment, you will likely need to pick up an app like Touchdown ($10 - $20, depending on sales) if you want to start using for email and calendar management.  (A shame - the built-in email / calendar apps are nice when they work...)\n- The metal rim 'clicks' a bit around the dock connector.\n\nI'm considering picking up the keyboard dock accessory, since the idea of having a physical keyboard + 16 hours of battery life on demand appeals to me.  I can attest to the fact that the tablet is well worth it as-is, though."}

The touch function works extremely well, the screen is vibrant, and the navigation is smooth. It is very stylish and I love that the honeycomb operating system allows me to use microsoft office product directly on the tablet. I access and update Excel spreadsheets frequently and, present presentations to clients using both .pdf and powerpoint formats. The book_kindle feature is superb and I particular like the one touch page marking so that I can return to the exact page that I choose. I've downloaded some free games and they all play very well. The graphics display are excellent and the touch function works very well here too. I also purchased the attachable keyboard which looks great when attached. It transforms your tablet into a mini stylish laptop instantly and the large comfortable keys work very well. Although the keyboard is wonderful, I've found myself using the touch screen most of the time because I keep the tablet in a case that easily converts to a stand (which is an eye catcher when I present documents to clients). EVERYONE that has seen this tablet has asked me where they can buy one ... it is simply a big winner and a must have for anyone looking for a tablet."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Bought the transformer 3 weeks ago and so far amazed by the quality of the tablet for the low price. It is cheaper than most other android tablets and certainly cheaper than the IPad, yet it is lighter than most, thinner than most and has the same specs as the most expensive android tablets (aka Samsung). The back is made of plastic, which several people have complained about feeling cheap, but it doesn't feel fragile, and the plastic is more scratch resistant than my old ipad. I have yet to buy the dock, but I'm extremely excited about it after playing with it at a BestBuy. The battery life on this baby is great and I plan to use it to replace both my ipad and my laptop once I get the dock. The only weakness of this tablet is lack of apps specifically for tablets so far in the android app market. However, this is getting better by the day. For example, the Netflix app came out just a few days ago. The winning point over the ipad for me however, is the availability of flash. I can watch all my amazon videos, can watch embedded videos in blogs, can play kongregate games, etc, etc, and adobe keeps improving the flash app constantly. In summary, I'm in love with my new tablet and am glad to have changed it for my ipad."}

She actually wanted an iPad 2 but I'm cheap so I thought this would be a \"better alternative\" (for my wallet).  Unfortunately, it did not work out so well.  The tablet is beautiful and the screen is magnificent.  I will say it is fast and worked well for the brief period that i used it.  After having compared it to the iPad 2 I will say the build quality did not seem as high.  The bad part came when I loaded some movies onto a microSD card and inserted it into the slot.  It went straight in all the way flush without any pressure and was loose (I could jiggle it).  I trying to pull it out but it got stuck about halfway.  I eventually got it out and noticed that when I put it in subsequent times I felt that it was spring loaded but the card would not read.  I was testing out multiple microSD cards and after repeated insertions I noticed that it would freely just fall out once inserted.  Unfortunately, it seemed the microSD slot came broken so it was returned.  This was in less than a day of ownership - the first use of the microSD slot.  It was disappointing to say the least but glad it happened right away.  It definitely seems the microSD slot is a weak link in these devices."}

Sure, I still have a workable PC, but I've only used it a handful of times in the past 4yrs. This tablet has taken the place of my netbook, and it's so much more appealing without that annoying fan, being so much lighter and having better battery life. I got 13h on the battery with this tablet yesterday and I don't have the keyboard dock. It would be nice if it had a SD slot or USB port on the tablet itself so I could transfer pictures straight from my camera to the tablet with ease, the only way I could do that now is either getting the keyboard dock, or move the pictures from the camera to my PC or netbook and then connect the tablet to my PC or netbook on the network or popping out the micro SD from the tablet into my PC or netbook and reinsert it. Sure, I can't move my Amazon unbox files onto it neither, although streaming worked ok, but that's the only thing that I'm missing that my netbook does, perhaps that will change in the future, if they ever make an Unbox android app. with save to SD card capability, please :)\n\nI don't know why so many are whining about there not being enough apps on android, I think there's more than enough.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "As an owner of a 1st gen iPad, but a great fan of Android smartphones, I decided it was time for me to get an Android Tablet.  I did some research into the Galaxy Tab, the ViewSonic gTablet, the Motorola Xoom, and the ASUS Transformer.  After some analysis, I found that the Transformer boasted almost the same stats as the Galaxy Tab and the Xoom, seemed to have better build quality and stock software than the gTablet, and came in at a significantly lower price than both the Xoom and Galaxy Tab 10.1.  I made the decision to get the Transformer.\n\nI have not been disappointed.  The tablet is very attractive looking.  It is thin, the hardware buttons are silver and vibrant, the screen is a nice black and the back is embossed with a nice scaled honeycomb pattern.  The software itself is responsive, Honeycomb 3.2 seems to run very well on the device.  The screen is the same technology used by both iPad 1 & 2, so it has similar display quality at a higher resolution due to its slightly larger screen.\n\nSometimes I doubt the build quality despite its attractive appearance.  Sometimes the chassis creaks when I hold it one-handed at one end, making me think it might fall apart.  I think I am just being paranoid though.\n\nI do have a bit of light bleed on one edge.  I only notice it when in the Kindle app when it's set for white letters on black background.  It's just a tiny smidgen of white at the top corner of the screen.  Hardly worth complaining about.\n\nAs an iPad user, I'm accustomed to very long battery life.  The Transformer performs as well as the iPad when in use.  However, the iPad can survive a week or more on standby, the Transformer can only go a couple days before its battery is drained.  I'm not sure how this stacks up to other Android tablets as I've never used them for an extended period of time.\n\nI am willing to forgive these shortcomings due to its price.  At only $400, the Transformer is far greater value than the Xoom and Galaxy Tab 10.1.  It definitely beats out the Xoom, and the only edge the Galaxy Tab has is a slightly higher pixel density in its display.  Additionally, the Transformer boasts an SD card slot and a mini HDMI port.  I can't say the same for the Galaxy Tab.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for an Android tablet, this is the one to get."}

So much, in fact, that I can not remember the last time I used my iPad.\n\nSeriously, this tablet by Asus is incredible, fast, and so versatile. The downside to iPad (and all the Apple hand held items) is nothing works, nothing can be downloaded unless you go to and thru iTunes first. I can understand the principle and revenue a closed system can generate (such as iTunes) but I hate feeling restricted or limited to their offerings.\n\nI think everything running Android has that inherent advantage over iPad - open source equals open system.\n\nAlthough I have not tried it out, I did purchase the matching keyboard dock to this device. My plans are to have my wife use it and carry it with her in her travels. She despises carrying a laptop (size, bulk, weight including the bag, etc). She did not take to well to the iPad but I am convinced she will accept the functionality (and portability) of the Asus Transformer with keyboard/dock. We'll see.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "This tablet met all my requirements, and exceeded a few. I upgraded my home computing this summer. I wanted a fast, zippy desktop computer as my anchor. I'd then use a tablet to remote desktop into the computer whenever I needed. The table had to turn on instantly and have options for a full keyboard and mouse. I also needed basic functions such as email, maps and Web browsing to work effectively. This tablet has met those requirements and made my life more productive as a result. The tablet is a joy to couch surf with, and I bring it to meetings at work. People that see me using it in public assume it's an iPad but amazed and confused when I tell them it's neither an iPad or a netbook.\n\nPros\n\nHere are my reasons for giving this tablet 5 stars:\n* Beautiful screen. The screen rivals the iPad screen. It's a LED-backlit IPS Capacitive Touchscreen. The screen has a wide viewing angle, and the colors are sharp and vibrant.\n* Solid construction. The back feels solid when held, and the tablet's weight feels balanced.\n* Android Honeycomb 3.2. It has great Web browsing, Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Maps and YouTube. They are developed specifically for the Android tablet, and they're great to use. Google Body is also nice. Netflix works great (but you need to sideload the app for the time being, until Netflix updates its official app). PocketCloud is great for remote desktopping. Google+, Google Talk, LinkedIn, Dropbox, Titanium Backup, Xmarks, LastPass and Documents To Go work just as well on the tablet as they do on an Android smartphone.\n* Aggressive pricing. It is $100 less than comparable models from other manufacturers for both the 16GB and 32 GB models.\n* Wifi turns on instantly when I wake the device. One quip... Asus claims support for 802.11n, but only in the 2.4 Ghz band. It does not have full 802.11n support, which would include both 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz bands. That only matters if your home network runs on the 5 Ghz band (some networks are configured this way to avoid the congested 2.4 Ghz band in high density urban areas).\n\nIf you purchase the tablet, I'd strongly highly recommend investing in the keyboard/mouse dock. This accessory is what sets the Transformer apart from iPads, other Android Honeycomb tablets and even the beefier and heavier Windows 7 tablets. The form factor is unique. Without the dock, the Transformer is an outstanding capacitive touchscreen tablet. With the dock, it's a netbook. While other tablets have accessories that give them physical keyboards and external mice, and some tablets even have awkward aftermarket accessories (e.g. cases) that connect the tablet to a wireless keyboard, the Transformer actually integrates with a keyboard/mouse dock in a way that feels natural. The industrial design of the Transformer is remarkable.\n\n* The dock's main innovation is a hinged design that converts the Transformer into a clamshell netbook.\n* It's convenient to switch between using the touchscreen and the keyboard.\n* You can enable/disable the mouse with the click of a keyboard button. In fact, there are a number of useful shortcut keys, such as a back key, wifi toggle, bluetooth toggle and audio playback buttons.\n* The dock almost doubles the battery life of the Transformer (to a claimed 16 hours of use).\n* The dock contains two full sized USB ports and a full SD memory card slot.\n\nCons\n\nAsus customer service is horrible. Some of the worst in the industry. It's support sites are unusable, it's help staff respond incorrectly about half the time (flip a coin, really). This is a company that produces motherboards and geeky products. It's an engineering shop, so do not expect it's company culture to align with service excellence. It also has difficulty communicating with its consumers for product support and sales. Jonney Shih, Asus's Chairman, is himself pretty geeky and thinks good products sell themselves. Not a bad thing, just shows how poorly this company has executed on it's vision, and how it hasn't followed up with a support infrastructure to back up its products. To sum up, great products, just pray nothing happens to your purchase.\n\nIf there's one criticism of the product design, it's that the power button is located at the top left corner of the tablet when it's in landscape mode. That wouldn't be an issue for most people, but I use that side to open the tablet when it's connected to the keyboard (the same way you'd open a netbook). It makes it a little more difficult to open it, but it's a minor design issue.\n\nThe power adapter is perhaps the weakest part of the package. The cord is literally 3 feet long. Nowhere in the instructions does it tell you the male USB connector is USB 3.0. If you plan on charging the tablet while using it, you'll either need to sit right next to a wall socket, or you'll need to purchase a USB 3 extension cord. Purchasing a second power adapter is also difficult. They are in short supply, and they will set you back $30 + shipping when you find one.\n\nThis isn't a fault of the Transformer so much as it is a fault of the Android platform for tablets. Apps are a little slow to come on Android's Honeycomb. Facebook, Mint and Amazon's shopping app are not yet available for Honeycomb tablets such as the Transformer. The Skype app works but lacks support for video calls (I expect that will be fixed in the coming weeks). The PocketCloud app is great for remote desktopping, and the developers are addressing many of the user community's issues, but there are some large issues that remain that prevent me from making a full jump into remote desktopping through the tablet. For example, the right click on external mice does not register in PocketCloud. I'll point out that this is a problem with the app for both iPad and Android devices.\n\nUse Cases\n\nUse case #1 - capture your meetings\nHere's a powerful use case. You're at a meeting. You fire up Evernote and type notes with the keyboard, and tag it for search. The presenter shows some diagrams that are germane to the topic. Her co-presenter scribbles a table of pros and cons on the whiteboard. You fire up the front facing camera on the Asus Transformer without leaving Evernote. You take photos of the slides and whiteboard for later, then save them to your notes.\n\nYou head into another meeting and before you seat yourself, you wonder if you need to be situated next to an outlet to recharge your tablet. The last meeting was 2 hours, but your battery still has 85% of its charge remaining. At this rate, you could use your tablet for almost another 12 hours before it dies.\n\nUse case #2 - watch Netflix on the flatscreen away from home, and experience viral videos with friends\nYou're dog sitting for a friend and don't have access to their NetFlix queue. It's the weekend. You walked the dog and he's asleep. You're bored. Attach the HDMI cable to your tablet and your friend's 40\" flatscreen TV, you then fire up NetFlix on your tablet and watch an episode of Mad Men. Substitute your friend's place with a hotel and you have another likely scenario.\n\nLater that week, you throw a party and you want to show everyone the new Kenny Powers video and a few other viral videos. You connect the tablet to your flatscreen TV using the HDMI cable and this time you search for the videos through YouTube. As you show them the episode, you continue to flick through other interesting videos on YouTube through your Asus Transformer so there's no waiting between videos. Once the first video's done playing, you start the next one. Thanks to Google's development of a YouTube app for Android Honeycomb, you have bells and whistles that are not available on other tablet platforms, like dual screen display.\n\nUse case #3 - access your office from hundreds of miles away\nYou're 3 months into a project and you're taking a week long breather from the office and retreat to a rented beach house. You get a phone call from work and it's a project emergency (of course). You need access to the work network to debug code that you contributed to the project.\n\nYou figure out quickly that you need licensed software that's only installed on your office machine. You decide you have to remote desktop into work. The beach house doesn't have wifi but it has great 3G coverage. While your tablet lacks 3G, it can tether to a 3G smartphone through a mobile hotspot (you're turning your smartphone into a wifi hub so other devices can use your smartphone's 3G data connection).\n\nFirst you create a mobile hotspot with your smartphone. You connect your Asus Transformer to the smartphone's mobile wifi hotspot. You then log in to Cisco AnyConnect. Next, you use PocketCloud to establish an RDP connection to your desktop that's physically located at the office.\n\nNow you have access to everything you need. However, as you attempt to use the Asus Transformer's touchpad mouse, it slows you down, and your fingers are too fat for the pinpoint precision needed in a desktop environment. So you connect a USB mouse to one of the two USB ports on your keyboard dock. From your tablet, you fire up desktop software and debug the code. The keyboard and external mouse allow you to run queries and debug code as quickly as you would if you were teleported back to your office desktop. After about an hour of work, you notify the team that the issues's been resolved. Crisis averted.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Transformer is a great toy with touchscreen goodness, but it's also a productivity monster. The minor issues are easy to overlook given the Transformer's innovative dock, gorgeous screen, quality build and low price point."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "If you're looking for the best Android tablet on the market today, then go no further than the ASUS Transformer. I've had one for a while now and while there are a few minor inconveniences, I love my Transformer.\n\nThe tablet, along with the dock, is perfect for my university studies, with its longlife battery, low size and weight and app support. I use Google Docs and Evernote for note-taking, both of which have tablet-native apps. For web browsing, the native Browser is good, but I prefer Opera Mobile. Even the ASUS-provided apps, such as File Manager and MyLibrary are useful, unlike my ASUS laptop, which was full of bloatware.\n\nThe screen looks fantastic, save for some light bleeding at the bottom. Not noticeable unless it is very dark and brightness is at maximum, it doesn't affect day-to-day use. Also, the screen can easily smudge but again, no affect on usage. On occasion, some apps are unresponsive on touch, although this is most likely an Honeycomb or an app problem.\n\nOverall, I highly recommended the ASUS Transformer, a great alternative to the Apple iPad."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "It is slightly longer than IPad because of the different aspect ratio of the screen. It uses IPS LCD as IPad does, which is also used by many high end monitors. The color is extremely good and is consistent over different view angles. It is quite responsive too. So far the problems I experienced are due to Android 3.2 (updated automatically when I turned it on the first time), not the tablet itself.\n\nWith a sceen of this size and WiFi connection, I'd rater view websites in their original designed form for desktops than the ugly mobile version. However, Android defaults to mobile versions, so users have to change \"agent string\" in somewhat advanced settings.\n\nThe best part: you don't need to install anything like itunes on your computer to activate or to install apps. You can also access files stored on your file server through a free app, so videos and music can be easily copied to the tablet over WiFi (you have to make sure those files are playable by the tablet of course). On IPad, I paid $3.99 for a similar app.\n\nThis is an Android tablet, so if you can't adapt to Android, it is not for you. Also note that tablets are not the same as netbooks/notebooks, they don't have certain features or flexibilities as those computers, so don't be surprised if you can't do homework on tablets...\n\nUpdate Oct 17, 2011.\nAfter upgrade to Honeycomb 3.2.1, the tablet started to have severe battery drain when it is supposed to be in sleep mode. A \"solution\" had been found (see [...]), but this was only verified on B60 version hardware, which is what I purchased. From what I read online, Asus is aware of the issue and will release a new update with this bug fixed.\n\nUpdate Nov 9, 2011\nWith the latest update of firmware (Android is still 3.2.1), the battery drain issue had be fixed.\n\nIf you would like to improve the battery life further when the tablet is in sleep, use Auto Airplane mode app to set the tablet into  airplane mode when the screen is off. The reason this extends battery life is that the system fetches information over the internet from time to time while it is in sleep mode, which consumes extra power. However, if you are using VoIP software and would like to receive incoming calls, you cannot and should not use this app.\n\nWhen the tablet is docked, it seems that disabling the touch pad improves battery life further in sleep mode."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Picked up the TF101 and docking station a little over a month ago. I love this tablet! I had been looking for a tablet for a long time, didn't want an iPad and wasn't really impressed with the other android options...for me this was a winner. Battery life is good and with the dock even better. The full test came on a trip where I left my laptop at home and cruised with the Transformer. I was able to do pretty much everything with this device that I would do on my laptop. Granted, yes this isn't good for everything you'd need a PC for, but thats what remote desktop apps are great for (used a remote connection to my home computer via the tablet 3 times while away). I've had to contact ASUS support twice for assistance (neither for hardware issues) and while ASUS' support is a little slow (up to 3 days for an answer) I did get answers for my questions. As for cons with this product I really only have two. First, there is a lack of apps that really work well with honeycomb tablets. There are a lot out there, but more would be better. Second, the speakers volume seems low (even with headphones) and the sound is tinny(sp?) granted this is a tablet so you shouldn't expect fantastic sound.\n\nOverall I think this is a great tablet for my needs, and can't wait to get my hands on the TF101G when available for sale in the US."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "In the way of 10\" mobile tablets, the Apple iPad and Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 dominate the market.  While both are truly extraordinary devices capable of doing much more than anyone originally believed, they both cost over $600 for the tablet alone.  Here is where Asus steps in to provide a device that offers the outstanding performance, battery life, aesthetics, and usability that both of the heavy-hitters offer, but without the price premium.  Below, I'll address three of the things people look for in a device they're hoping to use all the time.  After all, what good is a brand new tablet if it merely sits on the shelf?\n\nFor the purposes of this review, I will compare the Eee Slate with the iPad and Galaxy Tab 10.1, as they represent both the majority and the primary competitors for this device.\n\n1) Size and weight\n2) Usability and features\n3) Accessories and expandability\n\n1) The Samsung is currently the lightest and thinnest tablet on the market, and the iPad isn't far behind.  Asus is slightly thicker than both of these, but makes up for it with an extremely solid brushed aluminum 'bumper' around the edge of the device.  Whenever I hold the iPad or 10.1, I'm worried about dropping it or damaging the back finish.  Not so with the Eee Slate, where the constuction is every bit as solid as the iPad, but offers a more rugged enclosure and secure grip.  Instead of the iPad's slippery brushed aluminum back, Asus went with a slightly rubberized and textured back that makes the device easy to hold for long periods of time.  The bumper around the sides both provides protection and houses the speakers (when holding the tablet in landscape mode, your hands will naturally direct and amplify the sound from the speakers!), and makes it feel more solid and secure to hold onto.  Additionally, the Eee Slate has a coating of Gorilla Glass over the screen, which means you can do stuff like dropping it on concrete (I'm guilty of this) without scratching or damaging the screen in any way.  Out of the three, the Eee slate isn't the slimmest or lightest, but I think it makes up for it through superior durability.\n\n2) While Apple has made a huge deal out of the simplicity in using an iPad, the Android platform is nowhere as easy to jump into as a new user.  That said, Android offers considerably more features than iOS.  If you're a new person to computers, mobile devices, or technology in general, the iPad is a better product for you.  If you like having more control over your device, and having things like weather widgets, email notifications, bluetooth file transfer, SD cards, HDMI-out, active wallpapers, third-party apps, and custom ROMs, then Android and the Eee Slate are a better option.\n\nWhat is unique to the Eee Slate is the amount of ports and features that Asus crammed into the device, while sacrificing neither portability or aesthetics.  On the slate itself, there is a headphone jack, mHDMI-out, and a SDXC card slot- along with a 5MP rear camera that supports video recording and decent front camera for video calling.  In addition, the Eee slate has an ambient light sensor (so it automatically adjusts the screen brightness), accelerometer, gravity sensor, and GPS.  Now, this is special in tablets because most mobile devices don't actually have what's called stand-alone GPS.  Stand-alone GPS means that you can be in the middle of nowhere and have no internet connection of any kind, and the tablet can pinpoint your location.  For people looking into a GPS unit, imagine getting something that NEVER needs map updates, has traffic info, has satellite images, and can locate anything in Google Maps.  What's more, the Eee Slate has never given me a delay in pinpointing my location, while many GPS systems require up to a few minutes to establish a lock.\n\n3) In terms of sheer number of accessories, the iPad dominates the entire market.  You can find speakers, stands, docks, adapters, etc. for the iPad that simply aren't available for other devices.  While this is certainly a benefit, consider this option:\n\nThe Eee Slate has a keyboard dock that not only provides a keyboard, but boosts battery life up to 16+ hours, provides two USB ports, has a full-size SD card slot, and a multitouch trackpad.  For less than the price of the iPad or 10.1, you can buy the Eee Slate AND the keyboard dock.  When using both the tablet and dock, the Eee Slate becomes one of the most capable netbooks available.  If you are someone who needs to write emails and don't fancy an onscreen keyboard, this device is a dream.  The keyboard is almost full-size and feels like a Sony or MacBook when typing.  The keys feel incredibly solid and there is no flex in the keyboard.  The trackpad supports multitouch gestures like scrolling, pinch-zoom, and swiping between home screens.  Another nice touch is that Asus programmed the right button to serve as a back key, one of the most frequently used commands.\n\nWhile all of this has been overwhelmingly positive, there are a few things that aren't perfect about this device.  Here are the reasons I gave the device 4 stars instead of 5:\n1) The camera, despite being 5MP, is pretty awful at still pictures.  Images appear grainy and dark- and often out of focus or motion blurred.  Interestingly video actually looks pretty good- even when recording in HD.\n2) The power button and volume rocker are placed very close together.  When turning up or down the volume, it's easy to put the tablet to sleep instead.\n3) While the speakers are great for a mobile device and can get surprisingly loud, they are sorely lacking in lower frequency response.  If you listen to classical music as I do, everything lower than an English horn or cello is all but inaudible.\n4) Android is incredibly feature-rich and is developing at an incredibly fast rate.  This means that app developers are often stuck trying to update their software as fast as Google.  This game of catch-up means that Android tablets (particularly Honeycomb ones like the Eee slate and 10.1) often have apps that are either unstable (they randomly stop running) or require a force-close if they freeze.  While most apps don't exhibit these issues, it still is aggrivating to have a dialogue box pop up and tell you that the app you were using just force closed.\n\nThanks for reading this! I hope you find a device that suits your mobile computing needs."}

My kids have dropped it repeatedly, dented the metal, splashed it with water (not immersed thanks heavens), and covered it with dirty hand goo.  It still works and has awesome battery life (4 hrs) for it being this old.  Even considering the age of the tablet, i will recommend and have recommended this tablet to many friends and acquaintances.  Worthwhile to buy."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I bought my Transformer a few months ago.  The build quality is good enough.  The volume could be louder.  The screen is beautiful and good for web browsing, games, e-mail and video.  Still no direct support for Netflix or HBOGO, which has been a disappointment, but Amazon instant video works.  It comes with good remote control software that allows you to among other things remotely control your PC, which will allow you to remotely watch Netflix or run other apps that reside on your PC.  Battery life is excellent and it recharges much faster than expected.  It is not a replacement for a laptop for work, but for entertainment and e-mail it's great.  I have the keyboard as well.  I thought it would be more useful but generally it just seems to get in my way. To its credit it offers an sd card slot and more battery life, etc... so it wasn't a waste.  Overall I find the Asus Transformer a very competent device that was well worth the money.  It delivers as well as most other Android Tablets at a good price.\n\nUpdate\nNETFLIX now available and works great.  Automatically updated to the latest version of android software  version 4.0.3."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "If you're shopping for an Android-powered tablet, your search is complete.  I'm not going to go into all of the features but would rather share my experience with the Asus Transformer vs. a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1.  I had three Galaxy Tab 10.1 devices and all of them were defective. I returned it for a refund (thank you, Amazon.com) and went with the Transformer. This is not meant to trash the Galaxy Tab 10.1... I'm simply passing along my experience with both devices and listing the reasons why I went with the TF and not the Tab.  Here's why:\n\n- The Transformer now officially supports Netflix.  Streaming videos are properly formatted to the screen.  While Netflix does work on the Galaxy Tab, it's not \"officially\" supported so movies or TV shows that are formatted for 4:3 are stretched to take up the full screen.  Looking at people's squished faces for several hours during a movie can get tiring.\n\n- The Transformer has an SD card slot, so you can easily transfer files and/or load it up with movies/music/pictures, if you wish.  The Galaxy Tab does not have the capability to expand its storage.  If you like to load up your tablet with movies like I do, you'll eat through 32GB in no time.\n\n- The Transformer has Android 3.2, while the Galaxy Tab 10.1 has Android 3.1 with TouchWiz (if you elected to to install TouchWiz). Andriod 3.2 contains several bug fixes, most importantly the bug where apostrophies were being displayed as HTML code is fixed.\n\n- The Transformer does NOT require a special driver to be recognized in Windows 7. Just plug it in, and drag/drop files.  The Galaxy Tab requires a special driver download from Samsung's website.  The driver used to be very difficult to find on Samsung's website but that has since been recified.\n\n- The 32GB Transformer is significantly cheaper than the 32GB Galaxy Tab, and does the exact same thing.\n\nSo with those advantages, why would you pay more money for a Galaxy Tab? I understand not all of them are that way, and there are thousands of happy Galaxy Tab customers. My experience with it was poor, and it's too bad as the Galaxy Tab 10.1 is a sexy device and I WANTED it to work out. But I'm happy with the Transformer as it does everything the Tab does.... and the important thing is that my first Transformer worked properly out of the box, unlike my 3 Galaxy Tabs.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?!  Buy one!"}

The battery life all together with the base keyboard is awesome. I have travel with it and I did not even have to worry about my battery dying on me going through state to state.  16 hours is really good! Surfing the web is good with full internet browser if you know how to make it that way. it plays adobe flash with it does have some problems, when it comes to scrolling and watching sometimes choppy videos. They seems to fix the problem with the video recording. i don't see it choppy on the reviews in maximum pc. also when you type with the keyboard make sure you disable the touch pad, it is really sensitive.  their is no Netflix streaming still on the android app for this thing, just like the others. it also a little heavy when you carry the thing like a notebook. other than that I recommended to people, you can actually have at least  160G in total in the market SD card market, divided into two slots or just put it in the cloud for unlimited."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I've had my Transformer for about a week now. I don't have a smart phone and once played with a friend's iPad for a few minutes, but otherwise the interface was entirely new to me. I'm in love with this thing. The Android market has apps that cover nearly all of my interests, nearly all for free, and the device itself is sleek, easy to learn, and simple to navigate.\n\nI write professionally, so finding a tablet with an add-on keyboard was extra enticing. I also really like the gear that Asus has been churning out lately; I'm writing this review on an inexpensive Asus EEE netbook which is far and away more powerful than the last laptop I bought at several times the price. So let's go to price: The Transformer is simply unbeatable on price. I don't hoard music or films, but this easily has all the goods of much more expensive tablets on the market. No idea how Asus is able to consistently make affordable, attractive, quality devices, but they do.\n\nMy only complaint is battery life. I guess you have to get the keyboard (which I'll be adding later) to achieve the 16-hour life so many of the specs allude to. I haven't clocked it, but the Nook app really eats battery while Netflix, surprisingly, sips it. Also - currently no Hulu app, and Netflix is only available via a workaround app in the Android market (worth it).\n\nAll in all, I'm thrilled with this purchase."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "When choosing something like a tablet it is important to look into what you really want to get out of the product. Are you looking for something that might be beneficial for work or school? Or perhaps you want something that deals with multimedia well: on both accounts the ASUS Transformer serves as a fantastic product; portable enough to cart around and with plenty of features, a long-lasting battery, and a sturdy/durable body.\nThe screen is fantastic, with bright colors and high definition, comparing quite favorably to the iPad. Some useful features that the Tranformer has are a micro hdmi and micro SD slot, along with both front and rear facing cameras. A custom made keyboard dock can be purchased which can recharge your Transformer and adds 2 USB slots and an SD slot, as well as a multi-touch touchpad.\nTwo areas which the Transformer could be improved upon are the camera quality (which might improve after software updates) and the appstore for Honeycomb has some catching up to do. Both of these issues are likely to be addressed in the future, and are a minor detraction to an overall fantastic package.\nAll in all, this tablet is well worth consideration, and a great value for the price."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "This was my first tablet computer purchase, though not my first Android device. Overall, I liked the Transformer and the Android 3.2 OS.\n\nPros:\n* Very good build quality with only a little creakiness in one edge.\n* Excellent battery life (especially when paired with the keyboard dock.)\n* Bright, clear display with good touch response.\n* Fast and smooth operation in apps most of the time.\n* The Tegra 2 CPU and GPU worked very well when applications were designed for it.\n* Most non-tablet applications seemed to work, but there were some display issues.\n\nCons:\n* Flash 10.3 was very slow sometimes (in games, for example.) I think that it does not have hardware acceleration for the Tegra 2 CPU.\n* Noticeable delay when typing from when a key is pressed to when it is displayed.\n* Netflix app was not available. This was a big letdown for me, since it works on my old Droid phone.\n* Does not have USB port on the device. (Keyboard dock has two, though.)\n* The HDMI connection was tricky to get working with my TV. It made a difference which end I plugged in first.\n* The speakers did not have enough volume.\n\nThe major problem I experienced was the low number of quality tablet applications for Android 3.x. I think Android tablets will have a bright future once they are more like PCs with standardized hardware and software.\n\nIn the end, I had to return the Transformer and keyboard dock because it would not do what I wanted at this time."}

I already had an iPod, a bad Android phone and am borrowing an iPad so I have some decent basis for comparison.  I mostly use the tablet for web browsing, e-mail and reading e-books and the speed is more than sufficient for those tasks.  One thing I like about the built-in browser is I can specify if web pages should see the tablet as a mobile device, a tablet or a full PC.\n\nProbably the only feature where I prefer the iPad is the shape - the Transformer is taller and thinner than the iPad and I prefer the wider screen."}

This seems to be an extremely common issue and can take 4-5 RMAs to find a tablet with minor Light Bleeding. (once you see the light bleed you can't UNSEE it)\n\nI wish it had a USB port.\n\nOther than those two issues I love this thing and am very satisfied with my purchase."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "As a Honeycomb tablet, the Transformer works as expected: it has a good screen, good battery life, and is fast and responsive.  It is not as thin as the Samsung 10.1, but it is fairly light.  It can be charged via USB, although it charges much faster via its included, small AC adapter.\n\nHoneycomb itself works quite well.  It does have some rough edges, and I think usability is actually worse than the 2.x versions of Android: the absence of hard buttons means you have to hunt for different functions, the task switcher becomes cluttered with apps you thought you quit days ago, and the notification system is now some confusing combination of a popup menu you get by clicking on the battery indicator and some Windows-style icons.  The new interface for adding widgets and apps to the home screen also requires a lot more scrolling without giving additional useful information.  Annoyingly, some widgets just don't show up at all.  Maybe someone will come up with a home screen replacement for 3.x as well.\n\nWhat really sets the Transformer apart from other Android tablets is its keyboard dock.  Together with the dock, the tablet is transformed into an ultra-light compact laptop with a 15h battery life and tons of pre-installed apps.  This is what I actually bought the Transformer for... it was really between this and the MacBook Air; the Transformer is not only cheaper and has a better battery life, it also runs software that I actually want to run, instead of having to figure out an entirely new set of apps for OS X.  In fact, although OS X and iOS may have larger numbers of apps on paper, Android has more of the tablet apps that I actually want to use day-to-day.\n\nThe keyboard is not without compromises, though.  The Transformer keyboard is full size, but mechanicallly a little inferior to other laptop keyboards.  ASUS did a good job on keyboard integration into Android: the keyboard works well in many apps, and automatic switching between physical keyboard and on-screen keyboard also wors reliablly.  However, there are limits because apps simply aren't designed for keyboard use, so things sometimes work a little different than they might on a laptop (of course, you can always still use the touch screen anyway).  For note taking and writing, that really doesn't matter.\n\nThe HDMI output (on the dock) appears to work, but can only mirror what's on screen (as far as I can tell).  So for slide presentations, you are also a little more limited than you might be with a full laptop.  Compared to a tablet+bluetooth keyboard combo, the Transformer+keyboard dock beats it hands down: it is mechanically better integrated, you get the extra battery life, you don't need to wait for the bluetooth connection, and ASUS keyboard integration just works much better.\n\nOn the whole, I think this is a great and extremely useful device.  I actually do use it mostly in the laptop configuration, but i remove the tablet for book reading, mostly while traveling (at home, I have another tablet).  If you are looking for a machine for travel and note taking, this is a good choice."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "The Asus Transformer fully met my expectations, and allows me to do the most common activities best suited for a \"tablet\"- Surf, Read, Watch videos, Listen to music and Play games.\n\nThe default apps that come installed with the Transformer are really top notch (Polaris for Office, Asus keyboard, Asus filemanager, Email widget).. Typically, you should not need to install 3rd party apps that provide functionality already offered by the stock software/firmware. 99% of the instability problems reported on Android occur due to poorly written applications (given the numerous events in an app's lifecycle, accurate state management is not a trivial task).\nConnecting to a VPN is extremely easy (It is built into Honeycomb).. this feature should appeal to business/corporate users. Android/Honeycomb OS itself is very solid.. I strongly recommend that you do NOT try to \"lend it a helping hand\" by installing apps that clean up, speed up etc.\n\nHaving said that, the apps I strongly recommend, and use on a daily basis are:\n1. Adobe X Reader for android (Free - from the makers of the PDF format)\n2. 2X client for RDP (Free - 2X makes load balancing software on Terminal servers.. so they understand RDP inside out)\n3. MX Video Player (Unobtrusive ads with the free version) - This app does freeze VERY RARELY.. but I am ok with it as it offers excellent hardware rendering of most video formats (I mostly use it for downloaded .wmv content). This extends battery life.\n4. Dropbox (Free - Gives me an easy mechanism to send files to my Transformer)\n\nThe stock browser is a scaled down version of Google Chrome and it is very fast. Gestures work great, and it offers full Flash support (you will be prompted to download flash when you first use the browser)\n\nThe tablet looks very well made. The dual core processor (Nvidia Tegra 2) provides plenty of horsepower to make using the tablet a joy. I would also recommend you get a case, and more importantly a screen protector (You will be wiping the screen down almost everyday to get rid of finger prints - you can do this much more confidently knowing your screen is well protected).\nThe screen is very clear, responsive and bright (in fact, I keep it all the way in 'Min' to extend battery life). Glare is a problem outdoors and there is nothing much you can do about it. It feels a little heavy in the arms, and will require some getting used to... Sifting through full color pages on a 10.1 inch screen while traveling is an awesome experience though!\n\nI get about 8 hrs of continuous use on a single charge (I do put it in \"Airplane Mode\" to conserve battery when I am reading)\n\nI should also mention that I bought this on Amazon.

They quickly took care of the problem giving me several options.  Kudos to Amazon customer service.

I like the textured backing.\n\nReceived it last Friday and I have put it through its paces doing the following:\n-Received it with FW 3.0 and got the 3.2 honeycomb update within 2 hours. It also just happen to be the day Netflix.apk was out for the Transformer so was really excited.  Being new and expecting several updates for apps and software decided to wait to load the Netflix apps till everything was up to date.\n- loaded my micro SD card with photos of my summer trip and about 700 songs with no problem, photos look great and music plays.\n- Went to amazon MP3 bought 3 songs, download to device no probs, went to cloud player and played some of my own music and works as expected.\n- Went to the Android market and loaded my apps that were available for tablets.  Not all were available but most of my core apps were so no big deal.\n- used it for facebook and Google plus, email, surf the web, good enough.\n- jump in the car with my son, enabled my wifi hotspot on my phone and connected, used the navigation to get to a local burger joint (Jack in the Box..lol)..\n- did some MS office editing using google Doc and Polaris and good enough for basic/minor editing.\n-2 days later loaded the Netflix app, :-) could not ask for anything else. The device is now complete.  Movie played smoothly and picture quality was good.\n- hooked it up to the TV via HDMI, works just fine.\n\nSo overall I'm very happy with the Transformer and actually is more capable of what I had expected, it's exactly what I wanted.\n\nMy only complaint is that short USB/charging cord, also it would have been nice if ASUS could have included an HDMI cable with it."}

When a coworker showed me this tablet transformer, and then pulled out the keyboard dock I was in total techie love. I did my research, so I was aware that there  were limitations to the tablet - no USB port, limited memory, web storage that had a shelf life of 1 year before a subscription purchase was required - so these didn't phase me when I began using my tablet.  I love the eReader feature - even figured out how to get free books from my public library - and I've been able to use the polaris applications to open and amend work files rather than purchasing an Microsoft office bundle.  The speakers are pretty good without earphones.  I do wish that they would send this item with a cleaning cloth or instructions on how to clean the glass - I feel like I'm constantly fighting fingerprints and smudges, but I do know that they make protector sheets for these if I would choose to purchase them. There are limited cases for a tablet of this size. The charger gets FIREY hot, so you have to be very careful not to let it charge at night or when you're not able to watch it, but it charges very quickly so this hasn't been too much of a problem. For what I've been using it for (minimal internet, mostly ereader, file manipulation and doodlejump) it holds a good charge for quite some time. All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I don't typically do reviews on amazon but I will for this since it's such a large purchase.\n\nI will start by saying that I purchased this product from newegg because they offered a combo package with keyboard and tab plus free asus cover/stand for a better price plus free shipping. I love amazon, but money talks, and when it was going to save me over $50 to buy from newegg, I decided to go that way.\n\nFirst off, my wife received the tablet while I was on travel for work so she already had lots of stuff downloaded and ready to go. It was simply pick it up and go for me. That was nice.\n\nDisappointments:\nI read that I would be able to skype on this. Not so, at least for me. I couldn't get skype to work even though it was in the app store. Skype would open up but it couldn't successfully find anybody else on skype (users that I know exist) and the user that was logged into skype on the tablet couldn't be found either. Big disappointment. I know it's not the fault of asus, but it was disappointing because that was the primary reason I bought the tablet. It is so my wife and I can \"skype\" when I leave for my deployment.\n\nThe cord is impossibly short. I realize this is a tablet and it's geared towards being used free-handed without being tied down, but at the same time, would it kill asus to make the cord 4 feet longer? It's the small things that make or break a product in my book and this is something that I just can't get past. I've resorted to attaching an extension cord to the outlet and dragging that around with me. It works, but it's inconvenient.\n\nGood:\nThis thing is awesome, it is extremely fast, and responsive. The graphics are great and the USB, microSD, SD, miniHDMI ports are all very welcome features that will be well used, you can never have enough ports to plug things into.\n\nWhen I couldn't get Skype to work I resorted to google talk as a close second. I was elated to find that setup was a breeze, there weren't any glitches, and it controls both the front-facing and rear-facing cameras and allows you to switch back and forth between the two while you're in the middle of a video chat. I'm glad that Google has taken this into account when developing the Honeycomb and Talk software. I think Google talk is far superior in my book (at least when it comes to hand-held communications devices).\n\nI've had this for a couple weeks now and I have no doubt in my mind that I made the right choice. Everything is better when there is a certain element of modularity and diversity in the means that it can be used. Asus hit the nail square on the head by making a tablet that can be turned into a netbook with extended battery life and extended usability (added ports and memory).\n\nThe only problems that I have experienced are #1 after the most recent firmware update it has been having \"screen flickering\" issues. The screen will randomly flicker, and then stop again just as randomly as it started. It is annoying, but it is bearable enough that I plan to wait and see if it goes away on it's own. #2 For some reason, when my wife uses \"Tapfish\" the touch screen function stops working, even if it's in tablet mode. If you enter tapfish while it isn't connected to the dock, you must reconnect it to the dock to gain usability of the keyboard so continue with what you were doing. This glitch is likely a compatibility issue with Tapfish, but the glitch continues even after the app has been closed. The only way to restore functionality of the touch-screen is to put the tablet to sleep and wake it back up. When it wakes up touch-screen functions have returned. I'm not technically savvy enough to further diagnose the issue. My loves tapfish so I guess she will continue to live with the hassle."}

I purchased the keyboard with the tablet, expecting to be able to use the keyboard for typing emails and filling web forms etc. But the keyboard is all but unusable for the browser app. it's just to slow. I know I type fast but I didn't think I'd be able to type fast enough where this (I'm using it now) tablet would not be able to keep up. There's a big lag from what I type and what shows up on the screen. It will also lose characters...pretty much all the problems that come with not being able to keep up with the users typing speeds. This is very frustrating! It pretty much ruins the experiene for me, and I'm hoping they will fix this is a later patch. This delay is not as bad when using native apps like gmail. It's still there but no where near as bad as it is when you're using the web browser. I'm debating on rating this product as a 3 because of it. But I think I'll just rate the keyboard as a 3.\n\nThere also a delay when trying to type on the touch screen keyboard that is a little annoying but to not bad. I guess I'm more annoyed that there's a delay at all.\n\nOther then the keyboard and software keyboard lagginess, I have had no other problems.\n\nOH ONE MORE NOTE! Android does not support AD HOC networking. So if you were planning on tethering to your cell phone or other device you won't be able to unless you use bluetooth. This is another annoying thing, but that's a limitation of Android not the hardware.\n\nAnother note...as you can see from this review, there is no spell check on the tablet version of android, at least it's not on by default and I an't figure out how to turn it on.\n\n[UPDATE]\n\nAndroid can finally connect to AD HOC networks!"}

Don't get a non-Apple product and expect to use iTunes, don't get a wi-fi only tablet and then gripe about no phone capability, and please don't buy it for the camera (yes it has one but no phone or tablet really takes good pics).  For what it does it is a great platform.  I can browse the internet almost as fast as on my 3.4 gHz-6 GB ram computer and downloading a 1000-page kindle book takes about 20 secs. Works GREAT as book reader.  Battery really does last about 10 hours (was just using as book reader the other day and it lasted about 13). And having the USB and SD card slots is very handy for easy sharing of pics/data from one device to another.  I highly recommend getting a case and screen protectors to help protect your tablet; got one of the AmCase screen protectors and they fit perfectly and are relatively easy to apply.  Overall this is a great product that so far has exceeded my expectations.\n\nEdit 9/27/2014: after about 3 years this tablet is still running well, only thing that has gone wrong is the sound doesn't work anymore. Not surprising considering it has been dropped and bounced around quite a bit. I have never had any serious issues with it and the battery still holds a reasonable charge. This is still a very solid option for someone who doesn't need anything too fancy."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I have long been suspicious of the tablet form factor. Coming from fairly advanced PC usage, I have long built and customized my own PC's, and I would say I enjoy every bit of processing muscle my custom desktop can offer. I had abandoned the laptop form factor as too confining and really just too heavy lug from place to place (after years on a laptop I just got tires of the cost of upgrading and the cost on my body of carrying it about), opting to surrender mobility for a more seamless and comfortable productivity and application experience(on a custom desktop).\n\nStill, I crave and need mobility from time to time, where I would use a light netbook when traveling. This made the most sense, given that while I work on the road, I am not a committed road warrior.\n\nWhen Apple created the current tablet category with the breakthough iPad, the form factor was appealing but it came across as more toy than tool. As such I generally dismissed it and the notion of a \"Silly\" tablet.\n\nBy some accident, though I came across the ASUS Transformer. The tablet/netbook conversion struck me as ingenious and really just what I might be looking for, something light, portable and yet productive. Indeed, after a great deal of research, I convinced myself to give it a try. The technology still looks a little early and raw but I am impressed.\n\nThe Transformer is what I have been waiting for. Portable, it remains powerful for just the right purposes. Rather than replacing my desktop, it is a competent runabout or shuttle device. When I need to go mobile and do serious work, I take it with the keyboard dock. If i am simply mobile and note taking or at a meeting, I use the tablet section only.\n\nThis is not the generation of maturity for the tablet. Clearly the software and hardware of the Trasformer is not without it's quirks. Many apps are not useful or stable, but the productivity apps that are work wonderfully for everything I need to do. To name a few:  \"Genial writing\" lets we take freehand notes much like a paper notebook, \"Polaris Office\" is  fantastic for mobile word, excel, and presentation, \"Extensive Note\" is great for  typed and linked notes, \"Gmail/Talk\" is perfect for communications, and \"Cloud Print\" handles connectivity to wireless printers.\n\nI would definitely recommend this tablet for those looking for a light and mobile productivity device. It is as exciting as it is useful, in the right hands. In my opinion, it is the only tablet out there that fulfills the true light productivity role (rather than just a toy).\n\nIf you have been looking for something light to help get work done on go, or away from a station, this is the unit.\n\nI will definitely be on the look out for the next generations of this model. It does have room for improvement, but it is already a competent and highly useful item."}

There are no random freezing or reboots, audio is great, there are lighter tablets but seriously this tablet isn't heavy at all, it runs through very quick and if I notice any sluggish behavior (which is rare) I just use an app killer and I'm good to go.

Bought the tablet and the keyboard for a work and school laptop alternative. I have been using it mostly to browse the web, take notes and write reports for work. The screen is crystal clear and displays hd videos with no chugging or distortion. The tablet is completly silent which is a big plus as my old tablet (pc with stylus pen) has a loud fan . Screen reacts instantly to touch and supports 10 finger multi touch (ie in programs with split windows you can scroll one side up and the other down). Setup is easy and syncs to accounts easily. Only problem I have with it  is that many apps don't support the unit yet ( facebook, netflix) but I hope that is solved as the product becomes more popular. Also there is a slight lag between the keyboard and tablet at times not big but still noticable at times. Besides that the tablet performs great. Multi tasking with ease.

Plus we can access all the important files on the computer we link the tablet to so that no matter what, we both can have access to important files we need at the time without having to ask the other one to stop what they're working on so we can email a document or transfer something to a flash drive to work on the unoccupied computer with it.\n\nPutting the tablet together with the keyboard for the first time was a little bit scary, felt like I might break it, but I know how it feels now and it just makes it feel sturdy while the two are snapped together.\n\nThere is some trial and error when it comes to apps though.

Like your 'average Joe' review. I research, research some more, play with them in store, research some more, check the budget, compare specs....etc. over and over again because I don't want to make the wrong choice. I had an iPad that got damaged/refunded. It was great but then I started checking out other tablets like the Acer, Asus and Samsung. They are all nice. I chose the Transformer because of the screen quality, speed, ANDROID, optional keyboard and $$$!\n\nIt is VERY easy to set up, just a few minutes. Very fast. Syncs with accounts in seconds. Has decent sound. Loved the textured backing. Charges very quickly. Battery life is awesome! The keyboard worked as good as a laptop and GREATLY extended battery life. I GREATLY preferred the Transfomer's wide-screen format over the iPad's square-ness, especially for typing emails and watching movies. Also, it fit much better in every bag/backpack/lunchbox I own due to the wide format. The iPad was just too square and felt awkward when trying to type vertically. The lack of Apps is a bit frustrating but I wanted it for internet, email, movies...all of which worked better than the iPad. The Apps will come around eventually but most of the Ipad apps feel like they are made just for kids anyway. We do have iPods and an iTouch so I am not anti-Apple at all. Add in the price and it was a no-brainer, the Transformer beat them all.\n\nThe downside is I purchased two Duds. Both had extreme backlight bleeding issues...but that is the ONLY problem I had with it (NOT Amazon's fault). I plan to purchase another one in-store, so I can test it BEFORE I take it home. The expandable memory was key as well...just add your own Micro SD card as if 16GB isn't big enough! The WIFI worked flawlessly, even better than my Toshiba laptop and at greater distances in the house.

Welcome to the Android world of tablets.\n\nThat said, here are my positive and negative comments;\n\n+ If you are a Google G-Mail/Voice/Calendar/Contact Manager/Google+/Docs/etc. user, you will love how Android devices integrate with data you've already built up.  That said, (-)there will be learning curve for you on each and every app that duplicates that functionality on this tablet.\n+ this is a wonderful system.  Obvious price-point aside, I am thoroughly impressed\n+ the keyboard dock is an incredible option, as follows.  1) it extends the battery life by as much as 50%, 2) I used a USB connection to charge my phone from the tablet base when no other power was available (albeit, a pretty slow charge), 3) the two USB ports, mini HDMI port, SD card reader/memory expansion slot, AND the battery, makes this system a pretty good challenger to a Netbook.  There's also a Micro SD slot on the tablet itself.\n+ the battery can go for a couple of days with intermittent use.  With the dock, there will be minimal instances when you will run out of power.  Recharge is only a couple of hours - tablet separately, dock separately, or both docked together.\n+ if you don't turn it off - rather, let it go into sleep mode - it is instant-on when you lift the lid (when docked) or press the 'on' button (when not docked.)\n+ multitasking, touch response, screen resolution, and intuitive interface make me smile every day since the day I took it out of the box.\n+ you'll like the width of the bezel - it gives plenty of thumb room to avoid inadvertent commands.\n\nalso;\n- this is a tablet meant to operate by touch command.  Not all keyboard commands work as you'd expect from the docking keyboard.  I find myself using both interchangeably, but the touch is more intuitive.\n- viewing Netflix streaming movies is not ready with an app for this device.\n- Skype video does not work, although Skype audio is fine.\n- some video playback does not work yet.  YouTube and other native players seem to work fine, but others just aren't working, nor are they available for download for this device.\n- I tried to to buy an Amazon movie download for a flight I was boarding.  The player was not optimized for this Android unit.  (Remember my comments on the overall ecosystem compatibility ...)\n- ASUS tech support is useless\n- There was no user manual in the box, making me stumble through the initial learning curve.  Going online to ASUS tech support for some help was my first experience with their limited online functionality.\n- the charging cable is too short\n- I like reading books on it (I prefer the Google Reader over the Kindle download reader) but I am surprised how hard it is to hold it comfortably after awhile due to the weight and/or touching the screen inadvertently.\n\nOkay, having said all that, I am delighted with the this unit after 60 days of use.  I have adapted to using it for 95% of my use, which far exceeds my original expectation, over my desktop system.\n\nI hope some of these comments are helpful to some of you as you make your own buying decisions."}

I know a lot of reviewers (and critics of reviewers) are bogus anymore (companies actually \"buy them\"), which is a darn shame 'cause I always like to use reviews as a starting point. Believe it or not, this is an honest evaluation!\n\nI'm fairly computer literate and I really got into this product. I loved doing stuff just by touching the screen, a real game-changer. The screen was bright and came up quickly. The battery life is awesome--about 8 hours. I think the best features of a tablet are the GPS (however, it is a bit large to sit in the car), web access, Skype (phone ap) and games.\n\nWhat did I miss? A real keyboard (you can buy one for extra), printer drivers for the operating system (yeah, printing is a big hassle), and, I hate to admit it, the bigger screens.\n\nIf this thing does break down on you, you will have to pay shipping to get it repaired. This cost me $14.30.\n\nThe touch screen stuff is going to be huge, though. Witness the Ipad, Ipod, etc."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I am writing this review on my asus transformer as a testament to the simplicity the dock provides. I was an avid Apple user until I upgraded my iPhone 4 o an Infuse 4g (an Android phone) and was impressed with the customization of the Android operating system. I finally decided to sell my iPad 2 and go for the transformer, and as of right now I am rather satisfied.\n\nFirst off, for all those that complain about Android's lack of apps, that is complete garbage. Every app I used on my iPad has an equivalent for Android. While some games don't mae the jump, there are many Android games that I play that I like better than the ones on iOS. I absolutely love the customization that honeycomb provides. It is quite harder to learn for the casual audience, but with some simple research it is a simple transition. That is mostly becuase the Transformer has the power to make the experience smooth and enjoyable. Coming from an iPad 2, I had high expectations, and the Transformer met every one. As a tablet, this one is on par with the best, and for 100 dollars cheaper (and also with a plethora of ports that range from mini HDMI to 2 full USB ports.\n\nNow comes the fun part. The keyboard dock. I must say, I was prety skeptical when first shelling the 150 dollars for the keyboard dock along with that tablet, but with some minor drawbacks I can fully say that this combo has almost completely replaced my laptop. It is an almost full sized keyboard. In using it I could barely tell that it was any smaller than the keyboard on my Macbook. However, the true benefit of the keyboard is interacting with Honeycomb in such a natural way. The only problem I noticed was a slight lag when typing, but I am sure that Asus will fix that in upcoming updates (On that topic, Asus is very good with software updates, and that should also be noted) Another problem I had was accidentally hitting the trackpad while typing. It is extremely annoying but I assume it is more my error than the Transformer.\n\nIn closing, I believe this device is a viable replacement to not only my iPad, but my Macbook as well. It is fast, easy to use, and is a great tool for any task imaginable."}

I mean the heard instinct had me, most people buy Apple tablets. So I figured thats what I should buy. But you know outside of being really well made, cute and focused toward people who want to play music and games, and are social networkers, they really are just iphones on steroids. So you have already guessed that I'm over sixty. I don't want to do any of that stuff. What caught me about the Asus is that I could have a netbook with my tablet making it really versitile.  I ordered the keyboard attachment as soon as the tablet arrived from Amazon. This Asus eee Transformer allows me to do everything I do on my desktop, and I'm much more mobile than the laptop allows.  I can show cliants a variety of homes on the go, slip on the keyboard and write up a sale.  Read a book while waiting for cliants Load into it whatever I want.  It is as neat and slick looking as you could want. As for the fact that it doesn't have 65,000 apps like the Apple II, give me a break who wants most of them anyway. Sure there are fewer apps on Asus but they will grow in number.  It already has more than I need. The price is fabulous, quality great, it works wonderfully.  The 16 gb is all I need, just stick in a card if I need more. Oh yes, my 17 year old grandson was also going to buy an Apple II until he got his hands on grandpa's Asus eee Transformer 3.2.  He is taking his Transformer to college."}

Wasn't interested in the IPAD, otherwise most tablets would meet my needs (no gaming, word processing, powerpointing, etc) to surf the net, shop, stream Netflix. Mostly after having a smart phone, I simply fell in love with all things Android. LOVE the speed.\n\nI have a desk top, and had a netbook and laptop; sold the latter two. With bifocals, trying to adjust the screens right never seemed to work. The tablet concept is perfect.\n\nAfter briefly considering the Samsung Galaxy (simply stunning screen, but then the higher the brightness, the faster you drain power), I bought the Asus Transformer and man oh man oh man oh man, do I LOVE this baby. It is SLIGHTLY slower than the Galaxy (and a hundred bucks less!) but you'd only notice that or care if you are multitasking. It can be paired with a matching docking keyboard to convert essentially to an android netbook. I didn't want the weight and it sort of defeats the purpose for my needs.\n\nIt feels very, very good in the hand, like the textured back. I had a heck of a time finding the user manual (mediafire), but by then, I'd intuited what I needed. I've yet to Skype, but the front/rear cameras allow for that. I've ordered an AYL leather case cover (100 % five star ratings for only $15 here at Amazon, YAY).\n\nI like the more east/west design, non-bulky border, light weight. I will use my Kindle 3 as my reader and the Transformer for living room/bedroom, and travel.\n\nCNET loves this machine; rated just under the IPAD and Galaxy in Consumer Reports. Check it out!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "**See Update below initial review**\n\nMy little transformer is fun!  I purchased this in May-ish (late May, may have received it early June, IDK) I use it to check the news and watch some videos when I am around the house and when my computer isn't the most accessible or necessary.  While I can't say it has replaced my desktop or laptop I find myself using them less... still have to watch Netflix over the computer thou.\n\nI don't have many gripes about the thing.  Apps do crash and lag is apparent at times. There is much discussion on where to lay the blame for that; Google or ASUS?  I surely don't know.  The screen has stopped responding to touch input at times, maybe 4 times.  I am used to that with Android on my phone so I just give it a reboot (cold/hard reboot whatever).  On the Transformer it's the Power button and volume down for 10 seconds I believe.  Once it starts back up can I continue like nothing happened.  I also have some light bleed... well, a lot in the lower right corner and a few spots up the right as well, but nothing too annoying.\n\nIt's a great product. It feels solid and well built.  The backing while plastic is easy to hold and grips decently IMO...  It slipped out my hands once but that was my fault (and it was over the couch so can't report on crash impact tests).\n\nIf you're interested in buying one of these guys I would say head on over to your local shop and try out Honeycomb on a display model before you buy if you aren't used to a mobile or tablet OS as it could take some getting used to.\n\nAll-in-all... Really Like my Transformer!\n\n-*-*-*-*-Update about a year after purchase:\n\nA couple months ago (a bit after the ICS [Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich] upgrade) the power button stopped working so restarts are now impossible when needed (and needed more frequently these days for an array of different issues).  The only option is leaving it alone until it runs out of juice, then wait a few hours or days, and finally plugging it in hoping it restarts. Waking the device while responsive is only possible by attaching the keyboard.  This would be an issue if it was occasional or a certain custom app I installed but no... factory resets/wipes have no effect on the issue, cannot get through a full charge before the home screen icons or menus disappear and only left with the background and no way to restart.\n\nI am quite disappointed in its current state but has served me well... but still went bad too quick for my standards.  It's unfortunate though, I love the how the Transformer series looks and feels (especially the available keyboard dock option) but I don't feel comfortable purchasing another item from ASUS."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "For me, the Asus Transformer is a fully functioning laptop. Generally, I think tablets are considered to be less functional than laptops, however this machine can do all of the things I need it to do. Here are the type of things I use a mobile computer for in order of importance.\n\n1) Cloud computing. Bill pay, Google Docs, managing projects I'm working on while away form the office - I do all of these things online and the stock browser on the Transformer is sufficient for these things.\n\n2) Reading. Kindle, Nook, Google Books...all of the best eReader apps are available on Android. The Transformer has a great view angle and makes a great eReader.\n\n3) TV. Asus provides a stock media center app that can find your media center PC on your network. I can watch my movies and shows from any room in the house. Hopefully Netflix will officially support the Transformer soon as well.\n\n4) Games. The Tegra 2 processor allows you to play the best games on Android. This is a great gaming PC and will only continue to get better as Android becomes a stronger gaming platform.\n\n5) Remote desktop access. One of the coolest things about this tablet is Asus stocks it with remote desktop software, so you can get remote access to your Windows machine and do any operations that you can't do on Android.\n\nThe Transformer is a quality machine that can be compared to the Xoom and Galaxy Tab in terms of quality. Although, in my opinion, the price point makes it the best tablet on the market - and I haven't even purchased the docking station yet."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Ever since the new Tegra-based android tablets started coming out early this year, I thought about replacing my Archos 101 with one of these new tablets. It's a difficult process what with all the different models available and each with its own pros and cons. I finally decided to get the TF 101 over the Iconia, Xoom, Thrive, and Galaxy and, after using the TF 101 for more than couple of weeks, have no regrets with my decision.\n\nI only rated this as a four since I don't think there is such a thing as a perfect tablet but this one is really good. Display is awesome, the response is snappy (running on honeycomb 3.2), quickly switches from one app to another or from landscape mode to portrait mode, and connecting to my home wifi network is actually faster on this tablet than on my toshiba and hp laptops. I also only encountered one FC instance whilst using the Miren web browser app. It feels fairly solid with the textured back helping provide a good grip. The sound is alright and\n\nMy only gripes are the time it takes to boot up (longer than I expected) and its shorter than expected battery life, albeit requiring a full charge every couple of days of average use is not really that bad.\n\nBuying it online does have its risks - i.e. getting a lemon like most of the reviewers that gave this a one-star rating. But if you got a good unit then you will really enjoy using it for stuff web surfing, reading ebooks, watching videos, or playing games in HD format. You can also use it to access your laptop/PC and stream video or audio from it to your tablet, which means getting accessing to files in your portable hdd even if the tablet itself does not have a full sized USB port for this."}

Upon first boot, I was greeted with the standard Android boot up sequence. I signed up using my work Gmail account and all my settings, applications, etc. were automatically installed as I already have an Android phone on the same account.\n\nThere were a few minor things that weren't really work related, but I thought I'd mention them.\n1. There is no native Facebook app. However, the web based version and the 3rd party versions on the app store worked fine.\n***THIS HAS BEEN UPDATED. THERE IS NOW A NATIVE FACEBOOK APP***\n2. There is no native Netflix support. Kind of a boo, but oh well... However, it may be coming soon:[...]\n***THIS HAS BEEN UPDATED. THERE IS NOW NETFLIX (BUT I CANCELLED IT!)\nOutside of these two minor issues, the tablet is well built. The only thing that strikes me is that the volume button is not as tight as it could be - that is, it is loose in the chassis by fractions of a mm.\n\nAll of the apps I wanted to run (except those above) ran great. Google docs ran well. My email integrated nicely. And the tablet ran for 1 day, 5 hours, 49 minutes on one charge while attached to the WiFi in my house and the keyboard with 86% of the battery being used by the WiFi. That is, I left it running the entire time. Much longer than the 16 hours claimed. Not to mention, I used a lot of Internet and Angry Birds during that time. :)\n\nBoth Skype Video and Google Talk worked perfectly on video via WiFi. No complaints there.\n\nI was also able to tether my Android (Droid X) phone for Internet access via Bluetooth. The nice thing about this is that I have internet access where ever I may roam - and if I'm doing work in my car, the car doc keeps the phone charged.\n\nBesides the Facebook and Netflix issues mentioned above, the only time I could get the thing to crash is when I was I scrolling through my contacts in the Contacts app. However, I think there might be something wrong with one of them because it only crashes when it reaches 'D' - and if I get past it, everything is fine.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I will not list all the Pros and Cons for the Asus Transformer, but wanted to add a little perspective to the comments concerning...\n\nWeight:\nLet's define it by comparing something common in the United States. The weight of coins. Specifically, the US Quarter, which weighs 5.67 grams.\nBased on Order of Lightest Tablet to Heaviest of the main tablets under discussion...\nSamsung Tab 10.1 = 565 grams.\nApple iPad2 = 601 grams -- that's 6 US Quarters, plus not quite a Dime, heavier than the Samsung.\nAsus Transformer = 680 grams -- that's 20 US Quarters, plus not quite a Dime, heavier than the Samsung; nearly 14 US Quarters heavier than the iPad2.\nToshiba Thrive = 725 grams -- that's 28 US Quarters, plus not quite a Dime, heavier than the Samsung; nearly 22 US Quarters heavier than the iPad2; nearly 8 heavier than the Transformer. Another note on the Thrive: The included charger weighs 9.4 ounces - over half a pound. If it matters to you.\n\nSo... take 8 US Quarters and hold them in your hand. I would put 4 in each hand if you want to get a \"balanced\" feel. All 8 in one hand tells you how much heavier the Thrive should feel compared to the Transformer if you are holding it with one hand. However -- and this can be a big HOWEVER -- none of this takes into consideration the effects of how that weight is distributed within the tablet in question. More weight concentrated in different areas might make it \"feel\" heavier than it really is. A good 20-minute session at a local store might answer those issues for you better than this concept.\n\nScreen Quality:\nEverything is a little subjective in the statements you'll read. I love the looks of the Transformer's screen. Not having it next to the Thrive to critique it, I could still live with the Thrive. But if you take on the idea of objective testing, you might want to visit Display Mate's round-up testing of many of the tablets you are considering -- not yet including the Thrive. Their conclusion? Samsung's is fantastic -- potentially the best on the market -- but is crippled by over-saturation of colors (meaning, it's not life-like) with no means to correct it. With a decent color control program, they feel it could be far better than all others. They would place the iPad2 at the top of the pack -- for now -- concerning color display accuracy. With the Transformer running a close third.\n\nThey state that most people will be surprised to learn that their assumption that the 10.1 screens of these new Android tablets are much larger than the iPad2 is incorrect -- based partly on how you define the \"screen\". Part of the Android screens are all blocked by the Android System Bar, and the Aspect Ratios put their real estate quite a bit closer than you might think.\n\nI'm not an anti-Apple, nor an anti-Android individual. I'm still trying to figure out if a tablet of any kind fits my lifestyle other than as \"a thing of interest\" that I will abandon a few months from now. Like a Rubik's cube. Ideally, all I want is something to read a color magazine or newspaper on without having to pay $15 a month for each digital title, or to play with on the internet, or to watch the occasional YouTube video -- but I'd prefer doing that at 4G speeds. Samsung's 4G Tab 10.1 just launched at Verizon, but I'm thinking the Transformer tethered to my 3G phone would suffice, for now -- based on the crazy pricing for the 4G version and the additional service fees. No, I have NOT done this, yet -- so it may be a tricky operation. In fact, I have not decided on which Tablet to buy. If any. I'm leaning heavily toward the Transformer or the Thrive, but my decision is a little complicated because I already own an Asus Eee Netbook. What does surprise me is how many people will make a big deal about the Weight issue -- then immediately buy a heavy leather case to protect the unit. Or they'll buy the best-looking screen available -- then immediately cover it with an ugly screen protector that has bubbles and grit caught underneath. 8-)"}

Since I know Android and the tablet has been zippy and responded to everything I have done with it so far, I think it is great.  Screen quality is excellent.

The docking keyboard gives me the best of both worlds.  I can use it like a netbook or as a tablet and unlike the iPad I now have Flash.  The device uses a IPS display like the iPad and has a resolution of 1024x800, providing a beautiful display.  With its dual-core processor the devices is very quick also.  The tablet has HDMI out and a slot for microSD to expand memory.  The keyboard dock provides 2 fullsize USB slots and SD slot.  The keyboard also has a battery that extends the tablets run time to 16hours.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the lack of USB on the tablet itself.  But this tablet is just about perfect."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I've been mulling over this purchase ever since it came out. I chose this product over other tablets because of the keyboard that made it into a Netbook. I ordered this with my Prime membership and literally got it 2 days later, very fast! I also bought it in tandem with the keyboard dock.\n\nI'm very impressed with the speed and the UI flows very smoothly with very little lag. If you move around the UI in the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 you can see some graphical lag.\n\nPros:\n-Battery life is INSANE! I've been using this tablet allday n a full charge. I have it mainly attached to the keyboard but since I charged it to 100%, after a full day of usage, my tablet still sits around 96%! The insane part is if I were to pull off the keyboard and use it as a tablet for awhile to say 95%, then decide I want to use the keyboard with it, that 95% will be charged to 100%. I only charged this sucker once overnight and it is nearly at full charge still. INSANE!\n\n-Screen is amazing, it's an IPS screen so it is very vivid and colorful.\n\n-Keyboard dock, this separates this tablet from its competition. Other tablets have keyboard options but they don't fold and close into a netbook nor does it have 2 USB's and an SD slot on the keyboard itself. The USB slots let you attach a mouse, flashdrives ,external harddrives...however USB headsets DO NOT work.\n\nCons:\n-My MicroSD card does not mount. I may have to exchange it for this reason. I do not have a bum card. The funny thing is when I slide the same microsd card into the SD adapter nd slide it into the SD slot on the keyboard dock, it reads fine so I determined that it's a hardware defect. This is a very big bummer. I am confident over amazon and their flexibility with exchanges though.\n\n-Youtube: There's a flaw here and it has to do with the rotation of the screen. If you were to watch a video starting in a horizontal osition but then decide to rotate the screen to a vertical position, the video will RELOAD!\n\n-No netflix app. What the hell! My samsung epic 4g phone has this app and I can watch my instant queue but I can't do this on my glorious tablet?? WEAK!\n\n-Camera: You need good lighting to have good framerate for videos. Low lighting makes it choppy as hell. When u do get good lighting, u will notice a huge increase in framerate.\n\nOverall: A very good buy with the keyboar dock. Unfortunately for me that my microsd slot is broken. Once I return it and hopefully my next unit is not broken then I have nothing but high praise for this tablet. I am afraid to exchange it as ASUS is not know for it's high production value. I can exchange it but risk getting a unit with a broken power button or a defective charging port or what not. Very inconsistent with their build quality. Outside of defective units, the concept and execution of this product makes it one of the best tablets on the market. Upgraded to 5 stars.\n\nUPDATE 8/26/11: I ended up keeping this wonderful product as the microsd slot finally worked. I kept popping in the microsd card repeatedly until it finally read it. Maybe there was something tight or loose in the slot but it finally works. Also a recent firmware update fixed NETFLIX and the battery drain issue with the keyboard. The battery life is still insanely long. What happens is the keyboard drains its battery then the tablet drains its battery so you have 2 batteries to burn before needing a charge and this does last 16 hours or more of use. I use this thing all the time and I charge it maybe 1 every 3 days, and even when I charge it, my battery life was maybe 73%, nowhere near empty. Very happy with this purchase. I recommend you use DOLPHIN HD browser as I think it is a faster more responsive browser than the default one. Upgraded to 5 stars."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Let me preface this review by saying that this is my one and only experience using a tablet or android device for more than something like a 10 minute demo (I have owned the unit for a little over a month now).\n\nBackground:\nBefore I purchased this unit, I have been using a 16 inch laptop (desktop replacement style i.e. quad core i7 with a nice 1GB graphics card) and I wanted something that could meet certain requirements: live more than 5 hours on battery alone, have a reasonable weight that would theoretically not fatigue me after holding it for a while, be able to play time-passing games with an adequate frame rate, and have an output to an external tv or monitor. I was originally looking for a 14 inch laptop because i was intending to use that to carry around while still having enough processing power to run something like Matlab or Unity without too much aggravation. The search went on for around 1 year when I stumbled upon this Asus Eee Pad Transformer. Naturally I was skeptical about both the fact that it is branded Eee, because it was(to me) tethered to little netbooks with core atom processors and non-existent graphics, and that it was a tablet, something that I didn't have a lot of knowledge or experience with. But then I saw the Nvidia tag referencing the PROCESSOR and had to do a double-take on it. further research led me onto seeing that it had a docking station keyboard/battery that could last 16 hours with USB 2.0 ports. Even further research led me to believe that this was the best android tablet because of the IPS panel screen, the dual-core tegra2 processor, and the docking station.\n\nUn-boxing:\nI was pretty amped because I just impulsively purchased the 16GB version (figured 16GB would be enough space for mobile applications while all other files like movies and music could go on an external 32 GB microSD) and booked 1-day shipping on a Thursday. When I opened it, I was expecting a pristine product box surrounded by some sort of padding due to some un-boxing videos from YouTube, only to find some air protectors laid on top of a box with some rips and a section that looked like it was dropped onto a corner. But I kept thinking that the box means nothing, its the thing inside that counts. I opened it and was greeted by a nice plastic-wrapped Asus Unit.\n\nThoughts:\nFor the positives, this unit definitely improved my productivity when checking email and things in the morning before work; having the ability to use the splashtop remote program to control my laptop is a great feature; flash is great for the ability to view websites: the way they were originally intended to be viewed; nice 'scratch-proof' textured backing; the ability to have a dock-able keyboard for long emails or as a multi-purpose stand; another unexpected thing that this tablet is good for is a mouse pad.\nAs for the negatives: my unit was un-knowingly sent to me with a blown left speaker. it took me like 3 weeks to figure it out (i thought that these tablets only had a mono speaker until i read a review stating that the transformer has stereo speakers and then put the unit up to my ear only to hear crackling and weak output) also the shield in front of the 5mp camera on the back has a lot of dust (or something) that i can see in some of the pictures that i have taken. The over all unit feels very solid in your hands, which is good, except for the bottom right edge which is slightly separated and gets annoying when holding it and reading something for a length of time. As for the connectivity, I would have much preferred a full USB and HDMI connection (after some rudimentary inspection, the size of the full HDMI and USB port is larger than the outer rim of the unit) but with the dock(x2 USB 2.0) and a micro to full HDMI adapter those gripes are nulled. The right side (where the glass meets the plastic) is raised slightly when compared to the left which I found strange.\n\nPros:\n+Good battery life (the dock acts like a charger, not another battery source)\n+Very quick battery recharge\n+Nice IPS screen\n+Reasonably fast response (though when there is too much stuff on the home pages the swipe to the next screen lags)\n\nCons:\n-Micro HDMI (can be nudged slightly and loose connection) (design)\n-Effectively only a mono speaker (Unit Specific)\n-Dock needed to have a USB port for external hard drive (design)\n-No charge while connected to a PC while using Asus cord (design)\n-Lack of a built in ergo-tablet touch keyboard (Firmware)\n-Having trouble with the unit restarting randomly or completely shutting off when sitting untouched(unit/firmware/design)\n\nFinal thoughts:\nI am happy with this product save for the speaker(s) and the random restarting. Not quite a netbook replacement (android OS) but, this unit is a fun and entertaining outlet for your day. I would recommend this to a friend and compared to the HP tablet that I messed with in BB, this transformer seems to have been the right decision for the price, specs, and operating system. Three stars mostly for my specific experience (pros/cons) but I would have liked to rate 5-stars."}

After 10 days use, the tablet never turned on again. As an infrequent user and one who is meticulous about taking care of electronic items, I couldn't figure out what went wrong. After reading the reviews about the poor quality control Asus has with the product, I think my tablet must have had the same manufacturing problems. A little upsetting as I have purchased all of these apps and now must reload, but I am thinking of switching brands entirely after this experience."}

I did extensive research before buying it, and I don't regret it. I still think it's best-in-class for value, power, and size.  However, mine is headed to Texas for warranty repair on the power button.  From looking at online forums, it would appear that this has happened to several others, as well.\n\nSince ASUS' motto is \"persistent perfection,\" I trust they'll get it fixed, and get it right in future production runs.\n\nGiven my experience, and the fact that you should still buy one, I'll close with a word of advice: if you have even the faintest concern about the \"feel\" of the power button (I did), exchange for a new one.  I'll come back and edit this review after I can report on the warranty fix..."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "After a full day with the tablet and playing around with it I realized how slow the Android market is and the many lags this tablet has. I first got it yesterday I gotta give Amazon an A+ for shipping it to me before the delivery date!! But my issue is with the new system Android and the tab itself. When I first received the tab I was excited with it but scare because of Android having a bad reputation I bought a Galaxy 10.1 which I returned within days because Android was messy and really really slow, after that experience I still decided to go for the Transformer since it has a good reputation but I knew Android was going to be the same issue like the Galaxy.\n\n However, I bought it and gave it a try and I gotta say this Asus is way way better than the Galaxy, better quality, screen, brightens and weight is evenly nice I don't like very thin tablets like the Galaxy, however my main issue was the lag of the table, the volume of the tab is very bad through the headphones I put all the volume up and it was still very low for me adding to this I heard some tapping noises coming from the volume which were annoying they didn't last long but long enough to annoy me for a few minutes.\n\nThe browser will get slower when you install the flash and I couldn't find a way in turning the flash off so I had to leave it on or uninstalled which I end up doing, the tab to move the arrows to fix a letter or sentence was very slow is not like the ipad which you can fix any letter in a sentence by taping the screen and moving to the letter and fixing it, some apps in the android market will not load so I had to go back and refresh the page and do everything again which I found annoying! the screen is very sensitive to the touch so you might hit some stuff accidentally on the other hand for browsing or minor stuff it gave a hard time taping it, the widgets and icons were a bit of a lag they will not move smoothly as the ipad does, I tried to figure out the tablet but since it doesn't come with a manual and I am new to Android I couldn't do anything with it and I got frustrated and decided to returned it.\n\nThe good thing about this tablet is that it has a great bright screen with a hard ips screen style like the ipad \"really high quality\", weight is unbeatable not too heavy not too light, I love the wide screen I actually though I was going to hate it since I didn't like the Galaxy wide screen but with this Transformer I loved it, I love the material in the back front and sides I wish it was made in other color such as black or metal perhaps? I love that you can read third party apps such as Kindle, Google books and other readers it comes with few usable readers already!! I love the fact that you can use FLASH even though it makes some pages slow if they update the flash it will be even better!!!\n\nI love that you can buy freely with no restrictions from any seller not like Apple pie that wants everything for them!!! I wish the usb cable was longer perhaps 5-6 feet long? I wish Transformer would have come with a manual for people like me that don't understand Android and some Tab settings! I wish flash could be turn off instead of being uninstall, I think if Asus lower its price way more than it is I might get it back but I think for this price is not worth it yet, this almost $400 is too much for a tablet that is still in evolution I will price it for maybe $299 instead since it doesn't come with nothing else and the system still needs some issues to be fix, with a $400 I could get me a decent full size computer and have more to do instead of just playing games in a fancy tablet you get my point?\n\nAfter all as I mentioned if Asus comes with a good price tag maybe I will re consider it but meanwhile I am not wasting my $400 in a machine that even though it is good is not worth that much money!!\n\nIf I recommend this tablet? yes I do if you have the patience to learn a bit confusing system as Android and you love to multitask this is the tablet for you but if you prefer you invest your money in something more classy and more understandable I will go for a full computer or an ipad even though I don't like Apple's restricted policies!!!! but until they fix this tablet and come with a better price I think I will pass but if they give me a good price maybe I get me another one in the future!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "My first one had to be returned, and because at the time it was still flying off the shelf I had to wait for a second (the first had significant light bleed as well as a \"blotch\" on the screen with significant distortion).\n\nRight away I put a blanket over my head and checked for light bleed. Yeah, there is still some, but it's not easy to spot. I don't notice it ever, but I know I have checked and seen it.\n\nHowever since then it has been working like a champ. After I decided I was keeping it I rooted and switched to a custom ROM. I would probably give it 5 stars but I hear Android 3.2 does some things I don't think I would enjoy. I just got my dock today and have been playing with that and it's pretty neat.\nYes, there are some problems with Honeycomb that are frustrating (mostly typing lag) but over all this is an awesome little gadget. Now the only time I use my laptop is to modify my Transformer.\n\nI do not recommend this to someone who needs a new computer. My mom asked if she should get a tablet and I told her she could, but she would have to learn all new ways of doing what she's used to doing. Now, I have 2 PCs 2 Laptops, 2 android phones and this tablet. I can get anything I want done in plenty of ways. Could someone get by with just a transformer? Well, yes, but someone COULD get by without a computer all together (I mean, libraries have access, don't they?).\nIf you have very specific needs that a tablet could do for you, then you would be better off. The office software you can get for android is pretty ok, however everyone expects everything done in MS Office (I sometimes end up in a little trouble because I use OpenOffice on my PC) that you will probably run into some walls where you might have to transfer your work to another PC and fix it up a bit.\n\nIf you have yourself a sturdy work horse machine and you want something portable, this can do the job.\nMy biggest complaint about the tablet itself is probably the \"sharp\" edges. They won't cut anything, but holding just the tablet long enough starts to get a little painful. It will dig into your hands ever so slowly (it's not THAT heavy or anything, but hold anything long enough and you will probably find reason to complain). If the edges had been rounded I think that would have made a world of difference. Oh well.\n\nPersonally I like the idea of functionality so I almost switched to the thrive, however the dock to this thing is just amazing and so I couldn't do it. If someone wanted a recommendation between the two I would figure out exactly what they wanted done with it first. However I don't think anyone (with the right mindset) would be too upset with the Transformer.\n\nOh, and get the SwiftType X for tablets, it is awesome."}

When I got this tablet it worked fine but it was sluggish doing the simplest things. I was frustrated but tried to grin and bear it but it kept getting worse. When I docked to the keyboard more then half the time the tablet did not know it was docket and I understood this has been reviewed and such but it added to my frustration. I also thought the power button was in a bad place and finally the touch screen was either to sensitive or not sensitive enough depending on some unknown factors. I returned the tablet sadly and now use the IPAD 2 and honestly I did not want to use an IPAD its so restrictive with the lacking flash and application management but simply the IPAD works and I could hardly use the Asus. I blame Google and Asus for the problems but mostly I blame Asus this tablet has problems, pick up a Samsung Galaxy and see the way a android tablet should work. I did not buy a Samsung because if I went Android I wanted outputs and flash and when both options are not in one tablet working fantastically then IPAD is the only way to go."}

And with the keyboard dock, it slips into my shoulder bag without concern for anything bumping against the glass screen like I have with the iPad.  The tablet weighs only a few ounces more than the iPad2, but the build quality makes it so durable that I can't say I mind.\n\nI've been delightfully surprised by this more-than-capable tablet.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I bought the Asus Transformer and IPAD 2 recently because I cannot decide between the two. After using both extensively, I returned the Asus and kept the Ipad 2.\n\nI have an Iphone and I wanted to buy an Android tablet so that I can have the best of both systems. So I bought the Ipad 2 for the purpose of comparison, and with the rave reviews of the Asus, I expected to return the IPAD 2. At the beginning, I was really happy with the ease of drag and drop files in the file system, no more stupid ITUNE!!! And also the microSD slot and mini-HDMI output, these are all great features for the Asus. However, after using both for some time, the ipad stand out with its usability. With the Asus, most of apps are the ported version from the IOS system and a significant numbers of really good IOS apps are not available on the Android. For instance, Flipboard. Also IOS now is the fastest growing gaming system, some really decent games came out on IOS only. Also I updated the ASUS to Honeycomb 3.2 the latest version, but still occasionally apps will close down by itself or the machine just hang. It happened on the IPAD too on few apps I was using but much less frequently. Sometimes, even the browser on the ASUS could hang.\n\nFor the easiness of accessing the file system, actually if you jailbreak the IPAD, it would be the same, you can bypass the itune and just drag and drop files with a free program like the windows explorer. Jailbreaking the IPAD 2 is as easy as eating a cake. You just open a web page, install the Cydia App from the page, restart the system. That's it! Once jailbroken, you have access to the apps that allows the customization of the interface similar to Android. You will also find apps like snes, nes, psx, n64, mame...emulators to play games and they supported the Wii remote. Also, there is a Cydia app that can scale up iphone apps to be used on ipad without losing resolution. As with the remote desktop access function in the ASUS, IPAD also have the same app available, there is no difference on that. The only thing I missed with Asus is the micro SD card and the smart keyboard. As for the Mini-HDMI, you will have to by a separate hdmi cable. On Ipad, you can buy an hdmi adaptor and reuse your standard hdmi cable. So they are even on hdmi.\n\nAfterall, the ASUS is cheaper. The HW spec is impressive! However, I was disappointed with the apps available in Android. You will find more high quality apps in IOS. In particular, optimized apps for tablet device. Android at this stage, is still a little buggy, not as polished as the IOS. I suggest you to buy it in a store which you can return without the restocking fee. Also buy the IPAD 2 to compare. A 30mins test in the store would not be enough. Also don't be afraid of jailbreaking ipad 2, it is easy to restore back if you don't like it."}

Got it with the keyboard.\n\nThe tablet itself is snappy and handles graphics well with no framerate loss. To test this, I compared Galaxy on Fire 2 HD on my Transformer and my buddy's Tab with the graphic details set to high. At no point did the Transformer drop a frame or stall/hiccup while the Tab did seldomly struggle.\n\nI went with Android instead of iOS simply because my phone is Android, so the apps I purchase on my phone can be used on the tablet without having to pay twice and vice versa.\n\nSurfing the net is fast and efficient. I have a rooted EVO 4G running CyangenMod 7 nightlies and I am able to tether over buetooth which saves battery on both the phone and tablet. I won't lie, it took me a while (4 hours) to get bluetooth hotspot tethering to work between the two devices, but it was an issue with the EVO and NOT the Transformer.\n\nI do recommend getting a keyboard app (free) from the Android store that splits the onscreen keyboard so that you can type with your thumbs when not using the keyboard dock. If you're accustomed to a keyboard layout (who isn't these days?) it's much more efficient IMO.\n\nThe battery life when used with the keyboard dock is AMAZING. I leave it on all day at work, seldomly locking it leaving the screen on, and I haven't killed it. But again, I'm using bluetooth to connect to my phone for internet, I would imagine Wifi would have lesser efficient results. Another plus is that the dock keeps the actual tablet charged, so when I do pull it off the dock the tablet is fully charged with another 7 hours of life (and that's with constant use).\n\nOverall, I highly recommend. It's nice that it's cheaper than other tablets, but I would have paid more to have this one. Shhhh, don't tell ASUS I said that..."}

I was dissapointed, however, that UPS left a $400 tablet on my doorstep without a signature or knock. But that has nothing to do with the tablet or Asus. I'm actually using this and the keyboard dock to type this review. Overall, this is a great product. The MicroSD slot works well, I only have an 8GB class 2 in here now, but I am getting  16gb class 10 Micro and 32GB SD in the mail. Oh, and the keyboard dock has a USB spot perfect for my 500GB external Hard drive. Overall, I've spent $682 on the Tablet, dock, SD cards, and external hard drive for a total of 564GB of memory. Cheaper than an ipad still and much more memory. and it has flash.\n\nPros:\n-Fast\n-Works great\n-Battery life is supurb.\n-Android honeycomb (I haven't had issures thus far, but I've seen people have issues, maybe I'm just lucky?)\n-No creaking (My model doesn't creak around the edges like some)\n-MicroSD slot that works\n-Charge time 0%-100% In a little over two hours\n-MyCloud (Unlimited storage for a year!)\n-MyCloud desktop (just like logmein I can control my laptop but for free with this pre-loaded app just have to download the software from Asus)\n-Doesn't get hot\n-Light\n-Just like a netbook\n\nCons:\n-The hillariously short charger. VERY short. Three foot charger. luckily it doesn't need to be charged too often andfor too long\n-Wifi range isn't that great. Hopefully an update can fix?\n-Polaris Office doesn't have spellcheck unless I missed it some how. A downer but can be fixed with a new app.\n-The cameras. They aren't excellent and the back is rated at 5MP but I think my 5MP camera in my droid 1 takes better pictures\n\nIf you're looking for an affoardable tablet, this is it. Way more versatile than most of its kind. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this. I can't think of someone who wouldn't like this tablet. Very easy to use, easy to set up, can play for hours with the battery still going. Trust me, I read a lot of reviews and looked at other tablets, this is the best for its price. For a $400 tablet, it doesn't feel cheap at all. The build quality is nice with a bronze colored metal edge, the gorilla glass screen, and the textured plastic back really compliment eachother. Feels like an expensive tablet right out of the box.\n\nThe docking station is just as good (but I bought mine from sears because it was $10 cheaper) The keyboard has Android keys on it. (Such as music, browser, pause, stop, ect. ect.) And the color is the same as the tablet. Plus, it makes the tablet last an aditional 6.5 hours? Worth it.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I have had this tablet for a week now.  I read every review of the top Android Tablets.  Through careful over-engineering, and making the selection process way too hard, it was down to the Galaxy Tab and the Eee Pad.  The Eee Pad Transformer won the day.  I bought this with the keyboard dock.  What swayed me over to the Asus was the fact that the keyboard dock provided a space for extra storage and an extended battery, as well as two USB ports, and a Mini-HDMI port.  No other tablet device is offering that unique combination of features.\n\nI was having a hard time deciding between the 16GB model and the 32GB model.  I settled on 32GB since you can never have too much storage.  I put a 16GB MicroSD in the tablet's additional MicroSD slot, and 32GB in the keyboard SD slot.  GRAND TOTAL = 78GB OF STORAGE SPACE.\n\nThe ASUS Eee Pad itself is very responsive.  The screen is beautiful.  Any of the reviews that comment on it's construction are way off.  The ASUS is solid, feels solid, and fits nicely in your hands.  Battery life is surprising.  Today, I did content consumption for several hours while listening to Pandora and only used about 25% of the battery.  The pre-loaded apps are nice, but here are a few must-haves that you can get from the Android Marketplace:  Kaiten Mail; TwitterComb; File Manager HD; and Dolphin HD.  These are all improvements over the functional stock applications.\n\nDocked, it's a whole new machine.  You have access to additional storage, battery life, and a keyboard that will allow you to crank out emails, tweets, blog postings, or create documents/spreadsheets/ppts for school or work.  The keyboard is comfortable, and the touchpad responsive.\n\nCons?  Not any yet.  If I had to pick on something, it would be that the supplied power cord is rather short.  Shame on ASUS for not using a MicroUSB connection for power.  They went with a proprietary power adapter.  Also note, the keyboard dock does not come with an additional power cord.\n\nASUS has hit the proverbial homerun with the Eee Pad Transformer and optional keyboard dock.  Together, this is a combination that is worthy of business and leisure travel, as well as for use all over the house, campus, city.  It will not replace your corporate laptop or home computer just yet - unless your requirements are for more content consumption rather than hardcore content creation. In November, I plan on taking this device with me for a 3 week trip to Tahiti.  I will leave the corporate laptop at home.  The ASUS Eee Pad should be plenty to stay ahead of work while on vacation, catch a few movies, and read a few good books."}

I taught her how to use the web browser and Facebook. Somehow touch screen input seems more intuitive to my mom than using a mouse. She can also zoom in and out very easily. Also I don't have to worry about mom deleting any important system files. She still doesn't know how to use PC but at least she knows how to use an Android tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "There are many, many tablets out there now that are practically the same thing.  After pouring over reviews and technical specs I finally decided on purchasing the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101-A1.  Out of all the tablets that I've looked at, it had everything that I wanted...\n\n* A large screen - 10.1 inches diagonally (quite a few are now 10.1\", but there are still a lot that range from 7\" to a little over 9\"(like the iPad2)).\n\n* Comfortable to hold and carry.  I have large hands, and I don't care about using an item that's a bit heavier than others; what I like is that the back is textured to keep from slipping from your hand but is not abrasive, and that the \"border\" around the screen is large enough to get my paws on the pad with a firm grip without covering the viewable screen.\n\n* A built-in card port for extra memory.  The iPad2 (which is what everything is compared against) does not have one, and you have to purchase an accessory to use a flash card.  I *believe* that there is only one other tablet (at the time of this writing) that has a card port for extra memory (the Toshiba Thrive) and it can use a full-sized SD card, while the Transformer can only use a Micro-SD card.  This is really only 1 of 2 \"real\" complaints that I have about the Transformer - I wish it could use a full sized SD card instead of the Micro-SD.  (I already have several 32Gb SD Cards that I use for a digital camera and I could have used one (or more) of those instead of having to purchase another (or two) cards specifically for the Transformer.)\n\n* The picture on it is gorgeous, it is quick, easy to use and sounds great.\n\nI've played with the Toshiba Thrive at Best Buy, and in my opinion it is really the only tablet that can be compared with the Transformer; and there's a couple of things that it does that the Transformer doesn't: it can use the full-sized SD Card (mentioned above), it can use a USB cable (mini or full sized), and it has a full-sized HDMI port as opposed to a mini-HDMI (which I have a cable for my digital camera, so I don't have to worry about that).\n\nNow at this point I'm sure you're wondering \"Why didn't you go with the Toshiba Thrive instead?\"  Well, here's are the reasons:\n\n1) It is $70 cheaper than the Toshiba Thrive (at least on Amazon.com; $80 on normal retail prices);\n\n2) The&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Asus-Keyboard-Docking-Station-for-Eee-Pad-Transformer-TF101-DOCKING/dp/B004U78628/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Asus Keyboard/Docking Station for Eee Pad Transformer (TF101 DOCKING)</a>&nbsp;(while more expensive than the Thrive's) includes all of the \"missing\" features as well as a keyboard and increased battery life (which the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Toshiba-Thrive-Multi-Dock-with-HDMI-for-10-1-Inch-Tablet-PA3934U-1PRP/dp/B004YIFOP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Toshiba Thrive Multi-Dock with HDMI for 10.1-Inch Tablet (PA3934U-1PRP)</a>&nbsp;does not have).  (And be honest, anyone purchasing a tablet is probably going to get a docking station too. Considering the price difference between the tablets and the docking stations, together they pretty much even out.  The Transformer's docking station brings the total price up above the Thrive's...but then you get a keyboard with it.);\n\n3) I understand that it was a floor model that I was \"playing with,\" but I was not impressed by the Toshiba Thrive while I was checking it out in Best Buy.  (Floor models have been \"tested\" and \"played with\" by many people...they're like rental cars - almost nobody treats them with respect.)  But then, it may also have to do with reason #4;\n\n4) This one is personal, so it is biased - I've never cared for Toshiba products.\n\nSo...knowing what I was also going to (eventually) purchase, I realized that the Transformer was the best tablet for me.  And I'm glad I got it!\n\nNow, earlier I had said that Micro-SD card (instead of a full sized SD card, which is available on the docking station) was one of the two \"real\" complaints that I had.  The other \"real\" complaint is that the cable you get with the tablet to plug into a computer or an electrical outlet for charging (USB to electrical adapter is included with the tablet) is too short.  It is *maybe* 3' long.  It really should be at least 6' long.  If you're going to plug it into an electrical outlet, 3' is just not long enough to be generally useful.  (You're not always going to have access to a powerstrip or a wall outlet that makes charging and using your tablet comfortable.)\n\nI have one minor complaint, which to me isn't \"real\"...but more of a suggestion: there is no \"Get Started\" guide or manual included with the tablet.  Granted, it was partially charged when I got it and the setup for it is *very easy*; it just would have been nice to include a \"Get Started\" guide.\n\nThere was one surprise that I received with ASUS's Eee Pad (Transformer)!  I don't know if something like this comes with all the other tablets, and if it doesn't this is a GREAT selling point for the Transformer: once setup and synced with your computer, the Transformer can take control of your desktop computer from over the Internet!  So, if you're...say...at school (or work) and you need some important information that you forget to sync or copy over to your tablet, if you're computer is on you can double-tap the application to control your computer and get that info!  (I've even played World of Warcraft via my Transformer through my computer.)\n\nAll-in-all, I am *extremely* happy with my purchase...and all my friends that I have shown it to are jealous and want one too!  If you're looking at getting a tablet, I highly recommend this one!  (Don't forget the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Asus-Keyboard-Docking-Station-for-Eee-Pad-Transformer-TF101-DOCKING/dp/B004U78628/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Asus Keyboard/Docking Station for Eee Pad Transformer (TF101 DOCKING)</a>!)\n\n---\n\nUpdate - 3 months later\n\nI use this thing almost every single day!  I take it nearly everywhere I go.  I've synched my Outlook on my computer to my Google Calander, and since my phone is Android as well, whenever I enter anything on my tablet's calendar everything else is updated as well!\n\nWith the combination of SplashtopHD (the app that came with the Transformer that can let me take control of my home computer wherever I am at) and the Asus Synch (web storage) I can not only access whatever I need to wherever I am at, I can copy it to my tablet for local access and editing/handling.\n\nI take it shopping with me to either scan items or keep my shopping list.  (Remember, the Transformer is WiFi only - no cell access.  But my phone can act as a hotspot when I want it to, so I always have online access.)\n\nI like this tablet so much, I just bought one as a Christmas present for someone."}

So far, so good. Right out of the box I got her on facebook and her email. But here's \"the but\"....the way Amazon listed the tech specs, it led me to believe that the tablet had a built-in 4n1 card reader. I wanted that for her so she could easily transfer pictures from her camera to her tablet. No such luck. It only has (as far as I can tell) a miniSD card slot built into the tablet, not the full size SD/SDHC as I was led to believe. You have to buy the docking station to get that. So, BIG disappointment in the way Amazon presented the features (I own about 10 computing devices so I'm not new to the tech of it all) I read and re-read and was convinced the tablet came with the 4n1 card reader. She loves the unit but is disappointed that she can't use her camera's SD card. So, FYI, be careful if that's one of the reasons you buy this unit. Otherwise, it's very user-friendly. I won't claim false advertising, but VERY UNCLEAR does apply. Here's what I read on Amazon's description (cut and pasted) (If I'm wrong, apologies in advance to all)\n\nMini HDMI Port; 4-in-1 Card Reader (MMC/SD/SDHC/SDXC); 1.2MP (front) and 5.0MP (rear) Webcam;"}

My biggest problem with it was a \"popping\"noise that the right speaker would make any time I would do something that initiated a sound. This includes audible feedback on screen clicks and keyboard noise when typing. It became very distracting when using the tablet as I would find myself clicking too often to see if it made the noise.\n\nMy plan was to exchange for another Transformer because I like the tablet's weight and feel, but I wanted to make sure this was not a common problem. Sure enough, the demo unit at the store made the same sound, and I decided not to purchase.\n\nI ended up getting a Thrive and am very happy with it. The specs state that it is a heavier and bulkier tablet, but the rubbing backing, compared to the metal on the Transformer, fits well in the hand and the extra weight is hardly noticeable. With the built in 2.0 USB port, mini USB port, standard HDMI port, and SD card slot, it made more sense to purchase the Thrive rather than spend $150 on a keyboard that would only add more weight and inconvenience as I travel."}

Apps are a bit iffy yet as the Android software is upgrading and some apps that I really use alot are not up to speed.

But then the last update hit and the lack of customer support will no doubt make us not walk but run to Apple. I've waited 3 days for an email request for information. Contacting them by phone and waiting on hold for 15 minutes I found them to be uncaring and unhelpful considering that their last update has completely ruined the functionality of my tablet.\n\nIts too bad that these companies don't seem to get it.

First and foremost it's beautiful, fast, and dreamy to use. I had been obsessed with my ipod touch for fiddling around while I'm out and the tablet takes things to a whole new level - the huge, high resolution screen makes it comfortable and generally awesome to use.\n\nI don't want to pooh-pooh all claims of manufacturer defects, but I do want to set people's expectations closer to home. On a 1280x800, backlit screen...you're going to get some light bleed. That's almost guarenteed. Hell my ipod touch has some light bleed you can see at night, but it doesn't effect performance or usability at all. I suspect people are just balking at imperfections in their new toy, which is natural but not totally fair. Many people also say they've RMA'd because the bezel creaks or clicks. This may not be true in all cases, but I suspect a lot of that concern is based on the fact that the volume rocker itself clicks a bit when you are handling the device.\n\nConclusion - I was a little freaked out by the 40-something 1 star ratings implying the Transformer may have been built poorly but I don't think that's the case at all. I'm very happy with it, no complaints at all now that 3.2 was rolled out (there were some Transformer-only android issues that just got fixed a few days ago)."}

The only issue I noticed was that the left speaker wasn't functioning correctly, as reported by others as a software issue, so I was going to give that time for a fix.  The tablet build seemed tight, but on day 5 the back started to moan & creak, and the metal band around the out side started to get loose.  By day 6 the creaking was constant, the band wiggled and I could now feel some movement near the glass.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "The ASUS Transformer itself is well built. Metal wraps the outside bezel and a nice Gorilla Glass screen protects the gorgeous IPS LCD. This can make it hard to see in direct sunlight though, even with brightness at full. FFC and RFC give many options, and the 10.1\" screen is delightful. The aspect ration can be hard to view PDFs, but other than that everything is else on it is a dream. With the dual-core tegra2 CPU it's snappy and handles anything you throw at it. It's not too light and it's not too heavy.\n\nHoneycomb (Android 3.2) could use a touch more polish but overall is extremely useful and functional as well as beautiful. Any software blemish does not reflect the device itself. But if you are a heavy Google user (Gmail, Docs, Calendar, Contacts, Google+, Youtube, Blogger, Google Music, Picasa, etc) Android makes it very easy to get quick and automatic access to your stuff. Just sign in with your username@gmail account. Poof! ASUS decided to leave the stock UI untouched.

The extra battery makes all the difference, specially if you use the tablet all day like I do. Typing is sometimes a little laggy in the browser but not a deal breaker.\n\nWhat I mostly want to mention is that after about a week of use I started getting a launcher crash every time I went to the home screen. It was kind of annoying, this was with Honeycomb 3.1. Then ASUS released an update and that didn't fix the problem. Now with Android 3.2 (which was released extremely fast) the problem is solved. Now my transformer deserves 5 stars.\n\nIt's not perfect, sometimes it gets a little slow but if you're used to Android then it's not a problem. That's what happens when you can do whatever you want with your device, live wall papers and a bunch of awesome widgets will make it a little laggy so just live with it.

(To be fair, from what I've read, the other Honeycomb tablets aren't much better.) Sure, you  get a printed \"User Manual\". It basically shows the location of hard buttons and ports, but the hard buttons and ports are clearly labeled on the device anyway. In other words, it's useless.\n\nAfter much searching, I finally found the official Google user manual for Honeycomb. (Curiously, I didn't find it by searching Google.)\n\nI highly recommend this link: [....]. It's 140 pages, but they're smaller than 8x11 so it's not as voluminous as you might think. If you have the Transformer Wifi, you can skip the instructions for setting up your smartphone.\n\nFor what it's worth, I must add that even though Firefox says that there are problems with displays on the Transformer, it seems to work fine ... once you've figured out the new interface.\n\nEdited August 3, 2011\n\nFirefox worked great for surfing the web until it crashed.

It is very responsive and the weight isn't bad once you get used to having something more hefty than a phone in your hand.  The HDMI output is great, and using the YouTube app (instead of the browser, when using the HDMI output) will output the YouTube video you are watching full screen while still allowing you to look over comments and suggested videos on the tablet. (just found that to be an interesting feature)\n\nThe battery recharges quickly (about 2 hours) and with moderate use you can certainly get a good amount of the day in usage from the device.  Which leads to the loss of star point.  IMMEDIATELY once you get the device, go to ASUS.com and update the firmware.  The base installed firmware (before update) in the model I bought had a glitch that will cause the touchscreen to go to sleep (when the tablet does) and NOT recover.  The device has a power switch, a volume switch and the touchscreen, so without the touchscreen you can't do ANYTHING.  This is random, the tablet went several days before it hit me, but when it did I had just recently charged it.  The only fix I found for the problem is to wait for the whole thing to run out of power, the screen will recover when you recharge it. (hard reset, factory reset, wipe all data, etc all WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM)  But since the battery is pretty strong and I couldn't do anything to drain it faster (since the touchscreen didn't work) it was a serious problem.  But since updating the firmware weeks ago, it has not happened again so I believe it has been fixed.\n\nJust to note, the above is a SERIOUS issue, but since updating I've been very happy with my purchase."}

Honeycomb is pretty immature at the moment so there might be some apps that is not availble but I got what I needed. Evernote, dropbox, Office suite, youtube, facebook (friendcaster) etc. IOS have an edge in apps.. Not only are there more tablet apps in IOS but some of the noteworthy once are beautifully designed like flipboard, penultimate, iWork suites etc.\n\nFor me, nothing beats the Transformer for work and play. It is the best of both worlds. You will not be constrained as I did by customization (with the ipad) but if apps are important to you, stay with IOS. If not, the transformer will give you months and years of productivity and fun. The transformer is the most feature complete Android tablet out there. The Samsung is nothing compared to the transformer. It is thin yes, sacrificing functionality like the lack of microsd expansion but it will never hold a candle against the transformer as the best all around android tablet."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "TO ANYONE LOOKING TO REPLACE THEIR WINDOWS LAPTOP WITH THIS, THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE:  (anyone who thinks or knows that this is an asinine idea can stop reading right now -- the thing is, it looks a lot like a netbook, so the assumption that it might serve this purpose is, I think, somewhat sound.)\nI bought this in hopes that it would bridge that divide between tablet and notebook:  something with the size and portability of a tablet, but the utility of a laptop (the dock sold me on this, since I hate typing on a virtual keyboard).  The idea of being able to use it at work to do whatever light computing tasks I have to do, then detach the screen and watch a movie at night or read a book seemed really appealing.\nUnfortunately, it does neither well enough to justify the $700 price tag (with the protection, case, and screen protector, I think the total bill was around $900 even).  The first unit I purchased wouldn't accept a charge over it's PROPRIETARY charger (why, Asus??!!), which after some web research, I learned is pretty common problem.  It was replaced with a new unit that worked fine for the few days I kept it.  Aside from the first one being defective, (which is kind of a bad omen) there are a few things that render it far less effective than a cheaper windows machine, and hence somewhat frustrating in some critical applications.  First, the availability of Android tablet software leaves much to be desired, as many of the apps written for phone sized screens look terrible, don't run properly, or simply won't download from the Android market.  At the time this review was written (August 2011) You have your choice of a few hundred apps at most, many of which are games, or other marketplace filler not worth even considering.  All told, I think I found about a dozen or so apps that looked great on the screen, and ran effectively. While some of these apps looked and ran great (especially in the graphical news-feed and GTD category), it was annoying that nothing held a candle to MS Office or even Google docs run over a standard browser.  Simple tasks like attempting to enter a column of numbers on a spreadsheet (using any of the four apps I tried) was so frustrating and buggy that I gave up after an hour or so, and used my old laptop.  Web browsing is okay, though even on the tab's built-in browser, many pages default to mobile view.  Finally (and perhaps most frustratingly), two of the apps that I was really looking forward to using, Netflix and HBO Go!, are incompatible with Honeycomb, so would not load from the market.  An attempt to run them over the web in Flash resulted only in a message indicating that Windows or Mac OS is required to view video on this website.  (So much for curling up in bed next to my wife while she's watching \"True Blood\" on her Ipad.)  I'm sure this will be fixed in time, and I'm sure the market selection will get better, but I can't justify waiting another 6 months for Android to possibly come up to speed.  The apps that are good are really good, and the interface is fairly intuitive (especially if you are an Android phone user).  Hardware-wise, it lacks a few things which are fairly important, mainly in the area of connectivity, to make it an effective office tool.  As there is no Network cable input, you need to have access to WiFi to get on the internet, and the only way to print from it is through the use of two different cloud printing apps in tandem.  Getting files to and from it, and managing them is somewhat more complicated as well, since Android lacks a sturdy and multi-functional explorer program.  Overall, it doesn't feel anywhere near as flexible or robust as Windows loaded on even the most meager netbook, and the only way you're going to be happy with it is if you have a lot of patience, low expectations/dependance on it, and the ability to trade a lot of the functionality you would find in a standard laptop OS for a smooth but fairly light-duty interface that still feels like it needs a lot of work.  Just be warned."}

It charged the first time and then went nuts.  It would seem to charge, charger got warm, but no charge, then after it cooled, no charge, then after a few hours, charge.  Repeat many times.  I called Asus, they wanted me to pay shipping and would send it back after 1-2 weeks.  One star for the tablet, one star for Asus customer service.  So it went back to Amazon.  They refunded immediately (5 stars for Amazon) but couldn't replace so I ordered an Acer Iconia A500 and I am very glad I did.  Neither tablet is perfect but IMHO the Acer is better, better connectivity, etc.  I will review it too."}

But to write a helpful review, let me spell out things what I think left to be desired on this tablet:\n\n1. Built quality: I got the screen light leak issue, not really bothers me, but just for the record.\n2. I am not much into the docking keyboard idea. I would rather have a full size usb so I can plug in any generic keyboard.\n3. Charging port could be placed on the side so you don't have to take the tablet out of a case when charging it.\n\nOtherwise, I am very impressed. You will not go wrong with its price."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I did not really know what to expect when I  purchased this tablet.  I called Asus, told them what my needs were (a featherlight laptop that would accommodate my kindle when I travel), and they recommended this with the docking station and keyboard, which I also purchased).  Well, was I in for a surprise!  As I was setting it up, I became more and more fascinated; it is easy to use, and frankly, I find it addictive.  I have not travelled yet but to my surprise find myself using it every day!  I am very technologically challenged, no techie here, but I can use it pretty effortlessly and did so from the beginning.  One caution:  definitely get the stylus and screen skin.  They are pretty much mandatory.  The battery life is amazing and the apps are fun and functional.\n\nThis was my second Asus product, the first being a mega laptop never intended to go anywhere, now three years old.  Therefore, this is also the second time an Asus product has exceeded my wildest expectations.  I am now so sold on their products the next will be an All-in-One desktop.  Their products are pure quality and their customer service is truly outstanding, knowledgeable and patient.  They even manage to make me feel less stupid than I really am about electronics.\n\nI don't see how you can go wrong with the Eee Pad Transformer if you are looking for a tablet."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I have an Android phone and was quite impressed with the features and the customizations that it offered and was quite tempted to get an Android tablet as well. After much research i zeroed down on Asus as it seemed to offer the best features for the price. Also the reviews for this tablet was quite good. It's now 2 months since i purchased and use it daily and with that i can say without any hesitation it's one of the worst tech purchases i've ever made. Following are the reasons for my frustation -\n\nCons\n\n1. Quite slow for a 1Ghz, 1GB system. It sometimes takes 2-3 seconds before the apps launches. Sometimes it freezes.\n\n2. Tablet reboots itself for no reason. This has become quite frequent after my latest firmware update. Earlier i had 3.1 and it had the same issue then as well but the frequency was quite less, now it seems to have increased.\n\n3. Android itself being Linux related, was quite surprised to find there's no plug-n-play support for Linux. I've only Linux OS in my machine and it just doesn't get detected when plugged in through USB. After many searches found it can work only in Windows through ASUS software :-(, big letdown here. Spent couple of days just to get my docs/files into the device.\n\n4. Touch interface needs a lot of improvement, sometimes it works, other times you need to apply too much pressure to get it working.\n\n5. Horrendous reboot time, but my phone takes up similar time as well so i would blame that on Android or probably the number of apps that are installed.\n\n6. Volume buttons work even when tablet is in locked mode. Maybe this was by design and probably useful in most cases but when you press it accidentally or when kept in bag it automatically goes up/down. Same is the case with power button. I had an old phone where to get this working you actually had to unlock the device. I think that's a better feature compared to this one.\n\n7. When you unlock the device, it takes 1-2 seconds before you can type your password. If you type regardless, the characters are erased before the device rearranges the orientation and then lets you type the password.\n\n8. When you install apps through market, sometimes you have to do it twice because the first time it doesn't get installed even though it says downloading and installing. Really crazy, and this has happened so many times.\n\nNow for some pros.\n\n1. Price - This was the main trigger for me to buy it and got conned as a result.\n\n2. Screen - Quite sharp, even when i have the screen protector on.\n\n3. Sound - good only when you've headset, otherwise nothing worth talking about.\n\n4. Android Updates - Asus seems to be quite fast in releasing Android updates as and when they get released.\n\nI noticed some of the quirks when i started using right after purchase, but decided not to return as i thought they would be software issues that would get resolved with later updates. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be the case. My only hope is on Ice cream sandwich and waiting for it to come and see if any of the listed issues get resolved.\n\nIf you badly need a tablet i would say go for Ipad and avoid Android for the time being as there's a huge difference between Android on phones v/s Android on tablets. Not sure how other Android tablets fare. If you're anti Apple like me :) (though i would change my stance after this experience) you should probably try out HP Touchpad for what it's worth, it can't be worse than this one.\n\nTo end my post, very disappointed with the purchase, feels like every penny, nickel and dime has been well wasted especially since i purchased the accessories as well :'("}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I actually like Asus' computers and I really liked the Transformer, while it worked and I had it. But a little over a month after buying it (just long enough that I couldn't send it back to the store) it suddenly would not turn on. A search of forums indicates this is not an unusual event. So, I contacted Asus and they gave me an RMA number and said instructions would come for returning it. That didn't happen until I called again. OK, then I learned I had to pay to send it back. OK, fine, I sent it back by FedEx and their tracking indicated that it arrived at the Asus repair facility in Texas two days later and was signed for. The RMA instructions indicated I should get an e mail when the unit arrived. None came. I sent them an e mail asking what happened. Well, it's not in the system yet. A couple e mails later, they asked for the FedEx tracking number. I gave it to them and the indication of who signed for it. Then, \"well we will find out where it is and get back to you ASAP.\" Well, its now over a week and it still is \"not in the system\" but it will take 10 - 14 business days to repair and then it will be returned. I don't really see how they can fix it if it \"is not in the system\" and nobody at Asus service can determine where it is. I called today and was told that my case was being \"upgraded\" and someone, presumably with more authority will be contacting me within 24 hours. I am not holding my breath and I don't see how anyone with \"more authority\" can find it when its not in the system. This is actually the second (out of two) times this has happened with a return to Asus. I guess I thought that the first time may have been just bad luck and, as I said, I really like their computers and so, I gave them another chance. I actually love the idea of the Transformer with the docking keyboard. I really enjoyed it while it worked. But it is clear that their service is about as bad as it gets. Oh, and all the time I am on hold with someone trying to find my tablet, I am hearing canned ads about how world class their service is. Again the idea of their warranty is good. But since they lose items sent back, I can't see how it is world class. I deeply regret not being able to buy their products anymore, but I must say that anyone who does buy from Asus better hope nothing ever goes wrong with the item they purchased. Sending it back to their repair facility is like dropping it into a black hole."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I want to preface this review with a couple of things.  First I am a computer tech, therefore I am very particular about the promises claimed by technology( i'm sure most of you are as well) and I am a tech gadget nut, but only so far as having the stuff that lives up to the claims.  I'm not necessarily the type of person that has to have everything the minute it hits the shelves.\nNow for the review.\n\nI am also going to say that I have bought the keyboard for the tablet.  I am typing this review with it.\nI have just gotten the tablet and checked for a software update.  It had one available that was also firmware.  It updated to honeycomb 3.2 with no glitches,  since i have not tried it out prior to honeycomb 3.2, i am unaware of any major issues this update might fix.  It still does not support netflix because i have not rooted it.  I can wait a little while on that because it does stream amazon content just fine through flash. I am very impressed by the streaming of video over internet connection..no playback problems as far as stuttering .  The video does not look hd quality, but it is not bad.\nThe keyboard also found a firmware update as soon as I plugged it in...again no problems with the update.  The keys are responsive and the touchpad does not seem to be overly sensative or twitchy.  It is accurate and smooth.\nI have tried other tablets that only had android 2.2..I have rooted that tablet to unlock its potential and I have to say that my experience with this table while still roorted is better than the rooted viewsonic g-tab..only for the sheer availability of new options.\n\nI was also impressed with the ability to plug a SD card into the keyboard(from my camera) and copy everything from it to an external hard drive that has already been formatted for windows.  No problems at all and was very fast in the transfer.\nAdditionally, by usb mouse Logitech 305 worked as soon as I plugged it into the keyboard.\n\nAs far as the tablet without the keyboard, again the performance is very good and it is fun to play games, check facebook, twitter and read books via the kindle software or the nook software.  The tablet comes with an office program that seems to be pretty full featured, however, i have not written any extensive papers on it yet.  Nor have I tried to open an excel or powerpoint.  I will update this review when I get to that.\nAll in all, I am impressed with the quality of the build.  It does not seem flimsy and I have felt no flexing. Also I have not seen any light leakage.\nThe screen is bright and is good for viewing ant any angle.  It worked decently in bright sunlight, like any other color screen.\nI would highly recommend this to anyone, especially with the keyboard.  It is not a replacement for a fully functioning laptop that can run programs like adobe photoshop and such..but for checking email, facebook, and more complicated uses such as file tranfers from one type of media to another ( for photo archives while on the road), music and video streaming, it is certainly as good if not better than a netbook.  I know I will be carrying this to school much more than my big laptop.\nHopefully the firmware upgrade for the keyboard will fix some of the battery draining issues that I have read about.  I will update when I have more usage."}

I've even used it to remote into my desktop and play world of warcraft (it was playable, good enough for running around, auction house, would not want to do a raid with it though).\n\nThis is my 2nd tablet.

I've seen similar posts on this subject around the net...seems to be software bug.\n*UPDATE - Fixed...seems to be holding on great to all wireless networks*\n\nAsus weather widget stops updating after awhile...sometimes it'll refresh for a day or two, and then it stops refreshing for another day or two.  Random.\n*UPDATE - I think you just have to let it sit for awhile and it will start syncing on the hour.  After fiddling with the settings and getting nowhere, I decided to just leave it.  It started working, then failed again.  I don't know what the deal is so I'm using Accuweather's honeycomb widget instead.  It's working fine.\n\nMail check frequency while set to fifteen minutes, is working as if Push is enabled. I don't want it to receive mail immediately, i want it to check on my schedule...just like my phone does.\n*UPDATE - still acts like push*\n\nMy exchange mail profile shows folders I deleted over a week or so ago.  I've cleared out my accounts, deleted the application cache, rebooted, etc...those deleted folders are still showing up even though they're out of my exchange mailbox and deleted items folder.\n*UPDATE - Problem resolved.  After the update, I cleared the mail settings and those pesky folders are indeed gone*\n\nAsus Support - when I pinged them on their support site about this and had a ticket opened, they've yet to respond to me even though it's been a week.  Shame on them. From what I can see, you're on your own for support if something happens.\n\n*UPDATE - Their support system was down for maintenance and support emails got lost for awhile.

I was worried about screen bleed and the guy at Best buy assured me that they \"sent back\" the batch that had reported problems and that they only had \"the good ones\" in stock. That being said I guess I purchased a \"good one that has screen bleed\". It's not a deal breaker, but the lower right hand corner kinda goes from being shaded to not being shaded while in the dock. If i hased this I tol use my left hand to move the screen back in adjustment while in the keyboard dock, the screen kinda flickers which makes me warry. Sometimes there is a real lag when typing and having the actual letters pop up. When I purchased this I tolplan on using this for anuyd the guy I would be using the word processor Polaris and that it was essential that it could handle word docs. By the way the garble you read in the last sentance wasn't me, it was the dock. Even as I write this there is a delay in the writing. Anyway, so it has polaris and I transfered some files via USB which worked great, but as I began to create a doc, I realized there is no spell check. Ok right now the \"shadow appeared and disappeared\" hmmm. anyway, turns out that there are no android doc apps that have spell check. Not docs to go, polaris, office pro, etc. As i have read others say, WTF?? Anyway that IS a deal breaker if you, ok it just \"FU\" again. anyway I was going to say if you are going to use this for any kind of business device. I don't want to be too harsh on this little device as perhaps my expectations are too great. I am going to keep it a few more days and put it through its paces. It may be a good device for my wife to surf with. I'm still out on whether the screen issue is realted to it being in the doc or not. I'll check back  in later. Sorry for the garbled crap there really is a delay in writing.\n\n**** Update*****\n\nOk it's been a week now, and I'm writing this on my old macbook. I think the eee pad is fun, the screen issues never went away and I suppose it's possible I got a bad one, but honestly I have to agree with others, there really are some poor quality build issues, I just feel like it's not going to last a year of any real world use without a break down of some kind. Again, I think it's just early in the game. If you can live without spell check then word processing can be done. If you think thats un important, then I guess your just buying a very expensive web surfer. The camera really isn't that great at all, but I do like the android platform. It's great for some games and surfing, but with the screen shading off and on and occasional blinking it a no go for me for now, and I'm really sad about that as I was looking for something like this as advertised but I guess with better quality. I can just imagine having it die and having to go through the warranty... Best Buy did offer me coverage for $89.00 a year! Yikes!"}

Solid construction, attractive.  Good camera (not low light) that offers fine face-2-face video chatting.\n2. SOFTWARE... Mail App is good & easy to set up.  The weather/time widget is nice.  Essentially comes with a free remote desktop app called Splash-Top remote desktop.  This is definitely useful and usually goes for ~$10 in the Apple or Android Markets.\n\nCONS:\n1.  Other than the mail widget (which is good) and the free Splash-Top Remote Desktop client (which is terrific), I can't really tell what software here is HTC.  This is pretty much the stock Google Honeycomb experience, and many others have covered the pros & cons of that elsewhere.  So don't expect any Transformer-specific functionality.\n2.  OS quirks & somewhat clumsy/oddly named file structure means that realistically this is best suited to someone who is moderately tech savy.  Copying, pasting, and managing files is tedious, no real shortcuts (no keyboard shortcuts even with the Transformer dock), no ability to nest apps in folders in Honeycomb (wtf?).\n3.  Speakers are weak and probably not loud enough for outdoor or even coffee-shop-loud rooms.\n\nOther thoughts:\nSome suggestions for the best experience.\n1. Buy a large capacity micro-SD... (I use and really like this one: ADATA 32GB Class 4 Micro SDHC Flash Card with V3 USB Reader, Model AUSDH32GCL4-RM3RDRD)\n2. Upgrade to Honeycomb 3.1.  It's easy and quickly resolves many of the initial bugs in Google's newest OS.\n3. Setup Google Talk, it's a one-click FREE video chat software that smokes Skype and integrates with Gchat.\n4. Download Firefox Mobile, with the \"User-Agent\" & \"Adblock Plus\" extensions.  It's like a desktop browsing experience on a tablet, no more crappy mobile sites; can't beat it.\n5. If you also get the keyboard dock (which I have reviewed also) download the \"Dual Battery Widget.\"  A terrific little (free) app."}

In fact as i have read all over the web and try out other tablet at best buy, the TF can easily beat them by many factor. With the same specs as of xoom, thrive, galaxy, acer.... it comes with a stunning price. The responsibilty is topnouch far more than the acer and even xoom. Battery life and feature better than galaxy, weight less than toshiba thrive....... if u are NOT one of them who are fooled by ipple then this is the top choice so far, i promised.\nNothing is perfect, many TF has problem with their left speaker due to a typos in the system config file, which i believe will be fixed by future updates. The apps for android 3.1 are so little compare to iOS yet are growing fast with THD apps. Anyway it does mutitasking way better than the ipad2 with 1GB memory (ipad2 only has 512MB, the spec of the last year tech). 5 starsfor now, looking forward to the quad-core transformer 2.\n\nSent from my Asus Transformer."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "First let me start off by saying I just bought my sister in law a 64G ipad 2 that she wanted and I just returned a Toshiba Thrive 16G model.  This means I now have experience in the ipad 2, which is very basic.  The best thing about the ipad 2 is that it has tons of apps, other than that it's pretty simple and isn't nearly as flexible as android or for that matter the Asus Transformer.\n\nI returned the Thrive because it had a horrible issue that kept causing it to lock up when in sleep.  I had to pop the back off every time and take the battery out.  I'm sure they'll fix it but for me it was a deal breaker so I returned it.  Let me say, I'm extremely glad I did.\n\nThe Asus Transformer is very solid and relatively thin.  The build quality is leaps and bounds above the thrive.  It has almost everything you need in terms of ports and if you get the Dock, which I just ordered it'll have everything the thrive offers and in my eyes in a much better package.  The screen is very sharp and very bright, I love it.  I've had absolutely no issues with this device in the 3 days I've owned it.  Oh, and the battery lasts an entire day with heavy use, and I mean streaming movies, surfing etc. I can only imagine how long it'll last with the keyboard plugged in.  I know the keyboard had issues so I waited for that to get fixed.  If you go on Newegg it seems like they are selling ones without issues as no one has complained of the issues you hear on Amazon.  Not sure if Amazon is selling old stock.\n\nAnyway, I'd say you'd be hard pressed to find a better device than the Transformer right now."}

It worked very well initially, it was fast,the screen is really nice, external build quality is good, etc. However, the first time the battery was run down to empty it refused to be recharged and the machine could not be turned on ever again. I sent it back, got a new one, the exact same problem. I am sending it back and will ask for a refund. Asus used to be the quality leader in Taiwan. Not anymore. It seems like they just became one of the many Taiwanese manufactures axing quality, buying the cheapest components without any regard to their quality and reliability, rushing to the bottom. Sad story really. No more Asus products for me until they change."}

And right out of the gate I was really impressed with my Eee Pad Transformer. It loaded everything that I wanted with ease I'm surfing the net easily and with out the lag or wait time that my old desktop would have When looking up sports or reading a magazine article.  I'm also impressed with its portability.  The Transformer is lightweight (even lighter than some netbooks)and I don't have to take the keyboard dock with me to class.  But that is not the reason why I write this review.  The Eee Pad is an excellent pad so far but I'm truly impressed by the service that Amazon has given me.  They told me that it would be here on a Saturday and yes it came on a Saturday.

I read all the reviews on the transformer before purchasing and was impressed. I received it on a Sat, turned it on, went thru the set up and browsed the internet for about 15 mins. I noticed that the battery was down to 14% so I plugged it in and left the house for 5hrs. When I got back, the transformer was stuck on a black screen with a flashing Asus logo. I couldn't even turn it off. I called the worthless support center and all they could recommend was holding down the on/off button. I had already tried that but tried again. The center then told me just to return it. The battery drained overnight and the transformer finally shut down. I tried plugging it in again but all I got was the black screen again. Disappointing to say the least. As usual, Amazon has been very good with the return process."}

What is even more amazing is that when you look at the style of the writing they all seem to be written along the same lines. No product is perfect as far as quality control and software issues, but it is pathetic some of the negative digs made on this product. I have had this product for about a month, and I use it in the office with the dock via wifi to keep abreast of my e-mails, the calculator, the calendar, and internet browsing. I have used on occasion for hours at a time to listen to internet radio music stations via wifi. I have found it to be a very enjoyable product with no real problems to complain of, and very easy to use with the dock attachment. I only give it 4 stars because of android issues with skype, hulu, and netflix. I would like to set up internet webcaming/conferencing and I am not sure if the android 3.1 market is set up for it.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I bought this tablet after reading all available reviews for it since May. This tablet has met all of my expectations. I currently own a Windows 7 64-bit PC, Macbook, Ubuntu Laptop, and an Ipad 2 prior to purchasing the Transformer. I bought the Transformer because my wife kept taking my Ipad 2 so I decided to go with Android to try it out since I like my HTC EVO 4G a lot. I use this Transformer for the same thing I was using the ipad2 for, road trips and light internet usage before bedtime.\n\nPROS:\n- $100 cheaper than anything else on the market with similar specs.\n- Expansion slots. It is so easy to swap my movies back and forth and I don't have to rip them into a different format\n- Beautiful screen. It looks very, very nice. Better than my ipad 2 I would say.\n- Keyboard dock is awesome. I don't use it often but when I do, it makes my tablet useful for work.\n- Customization is awesome too. My tablet is unique and I can change the way my apps are displayed and launched. I hate that square folders on the Ipad.\n- Widgets.......the ability to look at your calendar without having to open an App is great.\n- Ability to stream or download files from my server and view/store/move them around using the file manager.\n- The mini hdmi out pretty useful. It can display my tablet perfectly on my widescreen TV.\n- The splashtop app is very useful for remote desktop-ing into your PC at home. I use this method to watch Nextflix right now.\n- Flash is awesome. Yes, it does slow the browser loading time a bit but for the sites I go to, this tablet loads the Flash content perfectly.\n\nCONS:\n- The standby mode for Android is not as good as the iPad 2 or even iPad 1. If you put the Transformer to sleep, it will drain faster than the iPad 2. Not by much but it does if you're honest about it.\n- The wide screen is cool but it is harder to hold over time. I usually hold the tablet vertically if I use it for a long period of time.\n- Browser lag. The stock browser lags like crazy. Especially if you're using the keyboard dock to type. My HTC EVO 4G does not lag like this so I'm not sure why the browser in honeycomb does. I downloaded the Opera Mini browser for free from the market place and I was back in business.\n\nThe only things I miss from my ipad are the polished games that are on there and Netflix. Netflix is coming and I'm pretty sure the games will too. The best part about Honeycomb is I can do cool things with it and I didn't have to jailbreak anything. I got some emulators running on the Transfomer and I hooked up some controllers for the kids to play SNES or gameboy games. AWESOME.\n\nI have a couple of friends who tried Android and didn't like it at all and some did. It really comes down to preference in my mind. My opinion on it is if you have the ipad and want to move to Android, hide the ipad somewhere or lend it to someone so you don't have easy access to it. Once you REALLY give honeycomb a shot, you'll wonder why you didn't switch sooner.\n\nFinally, I know some people on Amazon have received lemons. My tablet was part of the B60 batch so it was fine. There was no light bleeding, no low left or right speakers, no metal separation. My transformer does not creak unless I twisting the frame which I did once to try and replicate the issue everyone was talking about. Even then, it was a tiny creak and barely noticeable. I hope this review help someone, I plan on updating it in the coming weeks.\n\nUpdate (8/6/2011): So I have played with my Asus Transformer for almost a month now and I am still loving it. I have changed my mind a little bit about the build quality. It doesn't seem as solid as the Ipad. I noticed that when I hold the Transformer, the glass has a slight give by the edge. It doesn't hurt anything and the product still works like I expect it to, but I can tell that my ipad was better designed.  Since receiving my Transformer, I have not touched my Ipad for any reason other than when I have to charge the Transformer. The only thing I am missing is Netflix. I found some neat games on the Transformer and I also have the options of playing older games with the emulator apps. Overall, I don't regret moving to Honeycomb one bit. With a little bit of effort, I managed to transform my tablet into something that is functional but unique to my usage. I still recommend this product."}

I used it continuously for 3 hours including browsing web and listening to the music and only saw 1-2% drop in battery.\n\nThe keyboard is nicely built. The latch for locking the deck and the fit is simply superb. It feels like one unit. If you think about the keyboard, extra battery and sd card (full) + 2 USB all together for $149. It is a great bargain.\n\nThe tablet itself is very thin and sturdy. I do not have the problem of the slippery hold feeling. It is fairly light. Comparing to Ipad, it is pretty much the same feeling in hands.\n\nThe video display is not as vivid as Ipad. I also have an IPAD2. But it is not too bad. The extra resolution in Transformer does not feel so much different from Ipad2 - 1200x800 vs 1078x1024?\n\nThe audio quality is nice. I say it is better than Ipad and Ipad2.\n\nThe screen responsiveness is pretty good. I have nothing to complain.\n\nThe network connetivity is quick. I actually feel that it is better than the IPAD2 I have.\n\nThe biggest issue with Transformer will be Android itself. It is really meant for geek as opposed to the computer novice.\n\nAndroid 3.1 is not as smooth as IOS. However, the flash plugins works perfectly. I think that you will buy this unit just for that.\n\nBetween Acer and Toshiba and Asus, I think that Asus Transformer is the lighest and the thinnest.\n\nIt is the best buy for Android 3.0 and above."}

Ever since I have found very little reason to use my laptop and desktop computers.  It is so easy to carry it with you and keep it with you wherever you go, that conventional computers are clumsy in comparison.\n\nThe big benefits of this particular Android model is that it has external ports for external storage and HDMI.  The external storage allows for a micro SD card up to 32GB, and with Honeycomb, you can run apps out of external storage, so it is like a cheap upgrade.  (Why pay $100?)\n\nThe hardware is the same as the more expensive Samsung Tab but it is $100 cheaper for the same amount of storage.  The Samsung also does not come with the ports I mentions, so you pay more for much less.\n\nHoneycomb does have some limitations in that since it is so new, there are not as many apps specifically desinged for it, but a good number of the smartphone apps still run, and the number of apps specifically for the larger tablets is increasing all of the time.  I even bill all of my clients out of a free invoicing program I am going to upgrade to the professional version.\n\nApple likes to gouge the suckers for all they are worth (there is a reason they reported record profits in a recession) but if you like to get away from the hype and get an easy to use workhorse that doesn't grab for headlines, this Asus machine is a beauty and will serve you well."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I previously owned handhelds like the iPaq & enjoyed them a lot, but they just were not powerful enough to become a mainstream item back then. After a year of watching the various brands of dedicated tablets hit the market & start to become mainstream, I had been looking forward to getting the ASUS Eee Pad Transformer since before it was released. It has a 1ghz dual core Tegra 2, internal GPS, microSD slot, 10.1\" IPS screen & all for about $100 less than anything else on the market with comparable specs. The best part was that it was wi-fi only, so NO data contracts with my mobile phone provider. I thought I had found the perfect match for my needs.\n\nI finally had enough extra money (stupid, bad economy) saved up to purchase it & was VERY disappointed when it arrived. When received, the screen had blacklight bleed across the bottom, it does not respond properly to touch about 50% of the time, it has intermittent wi-fi reception (even if sitting within 2 feet of the wireless router) & GPS reception is intermittent too.. even when standing outside. What a tremendous letdown.\n\nAside from the actual defects, it will not stream videos from legitimate sources, even if those sources have an Android app.\nExamples:\nThe Netflix app gives an error code & further research discovered that the Transformer is currently incompatible with the Netflix Android app;\nThe Crackle app will play audio, but no video;\nExcluding the HBO Go app (I do not have their service, so I could not test it), the other legitimate streaming sources had no app, but gave Windows or OSX requirement errors when attempted via the included browser or Firefox.\n\nI tried using the software provided on ASUS's website (Eee Pad Pc Suite (PC version) with Splashtop) to stream through my TV, but it was like watching my 52\" screen at 3 feet away with a magnifying glass. Everything was cropped & fuzzy.\n\nThere's also the standard complaints about the USB/charging cable being too short, the speakers are weak/poor sounding & placed where you would hold the tablet, the front edges are a bit too sharp when holding with only one hand & the screen is a fingerprint magnet. Those standard complaints are all things that even I could overlook, but the stuff I mentioned in previous paragraphs are detrimental.\n\nThe defects are disappointing & would require a replacement, but since the Transformer can't be a quality streaming media player, I have already authorized a return.\n\nAs much as I hate to say it, I will either have to end up throwing an additional $100 to the apple tax, or go without."}

I don't have the light bleed issues the others are talking about. Solidly built for a slim tablet, my daughter has the ipad2 and it compares similarly to it. People complain about the operating system crashing I have never had the system crash or hang yet. I have downloaded quite a few apps and most of them play or run well. I assume that if you download poorly written or one written for an older rev. then yes they most likely will crash.\n\nSo from my experience\n\nGreat looking tablet with a crystal clear screen that really stands out. No Light bleed!!\n\nWifi works great for me hasn't dropped any connections yet. Didn't work with WEP.\n\nGestures are better than the ipad very smooth and responsive. Overall, browsers, applications and gesture response is snappy.\n\nMost of the better written application seem to work fine.

I can get about 8-9 hours depending on usage.\n\nCan be used with a bluetooth keyboard or other devices, you don't need the base.\n\nOf course there are improvements, the front camera could be better. Back facing camera works good.\n\nLonger charging USB cord. Provide online users guide, care and feeding of the transformer.\n\nHaven't had to get support so I can't comment.\n\nNote: I did set the default browser to run in desktop mode. Although, you can set to any of the three settings. Desktop, Tablet, Phone. Browser is stable and sites come up just like a full desktop page, and not the minimal tablet, or phone pages. Works great so far.\n\nOverall, I wasn't sure about tablets in general and their real utility. But, I carry this everywhere to work, around the house, reading the news, entertainment. It's more than I thought it would be and I am glad I pick this one up. In saying that though, I am sure there are some real lemons around. But, from what I have read that is happening with all the manufactures. So I would say try if you don't like it return it as others have."}

The tablet began looping the asus splash screen and would not move past it. I returned it to amazon and they sent a new one which arrived in only 2 days and worked for less then 24 hours. I woke up this morning and I picked up my transformer only to find that the touch screen was no longer responding to my touch. My advice is to wait until asus releases the second generation of this so that asus can work out all the bugs."}

There is a little light bleed visible around the edges when the screen is black, and I noticed a few blemishes between the screen and the glass, but these blemishes are not noticeable unless held very close. Apart from that, I think the IPS display looks great when viewed at an angle. Games are great on Tegra 2. Problems with keyboard lag were taken care of in the most recent 3.1 update. I'm looking forward to the 3.2 update and other improvements to come. I recommend buying together with the keyboard dock. I'm enjoying the Transformer very much."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "The Asus transformer is a great tablet.  I'm disappointed at the fact is that it doesn't get enough support.  All  my products are Asus from my Asus motherboard on my desktop to my other laptop.  Asus has been around for a couple of years now more than what most people know and they have came very far.  They make alot of components.  Recently they have been ahead of everyone else in their pursuit of perfection.  The problem is in that pursuit of perfection other companies have been trying to forget about them.  While the Motorola Xoom and Ipad 2 keep on getting current update the Transformer has been left with stocked software.  Sure you have the OS update but what im talking about is moonlight the andriod silverlight.  Motorola Xoom with it's crappy screen and dull processor it gets to watch Nexflix.  Of course my complain isn't just that.  Hulu as well the flash update won't allow users of the Transformer to watch Hulu.  I think it's horrible that brand name products that have been around for way longer than Asus are getting surpassed by what they thought to be an inferior company.  Asus should just come up with their own OS and build their own empire without the help of anyone else."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "The pricing on the product was perfect and on point. I got the actual tablet paired with the keyboard dock and it makes for a good combination. At a price point of $400 and with specs that matched up with other tablets in the higher price range ($600-$800), this one was definitely a good deal.\n\nThe tablet itself is a great idea, looks great, and feels pretty good. There were a few quality control issues such as a gap between the screen and the bezel on the side of the screen, VERY MINOR light bleed (which is a problem on most screens), one spec of dust under the rear camera lens, and a bit of a creak when holding it until the plastic settles right. Alongside that, the power button could be a bit easier to push and it could have come with a longer charging cable.\n\nOverall, it was a great piece of hardware with an amazing display screen, a lot of processing power, decent speakers, responsive touch screen, great software, and a stylish look with a good gripping back. It is a good replacement for a laptop IF you are looking for something super portable, with great battery life, and mostly use your laptop for watching movies, browsing the internet, doing some word processing, and playing games.\n\nAs far as the Android Honeycomb software, clearly anyone familiar with it knows that there are still bugs that need to be worked out, but that is consistent with every Android powered tablet, and not just this one in particular. Once upgrades come, it will work even more flawlessly.\n\nI would recommend this product to others."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "This has got to be the best tablet there is. Sure the I pad is nice but its nice to have the I pad speed and android customization all in one device. The screen is beautiful and very responsive. The web browser is great and easy to use and its great that you can turn flash on or off. The notifications are great also, they are unobtrusive and easy to view and its nice that they don't pop up in the middle of your screen like the Ipad. Multitasking is also nice and easy to use and very quick switching from different apps. While not quite as thin as the new Galaxy tab 10.1 it has more useful options like the HDMI output so you don't have o buy extra adapters and an SD card slot which is nice because you never have to worry about using up all of your memory. The back also has a very nice texture to it and everyone say it lacks in build quality but as long as you don't try and replace a stress ball with it then you won't notice. All in all it is a great tablet."}

He gave me a number to call in case I needed further assistance and the area code and phone number,or wherever they are located was very odd.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "The tablet has been an excellent replacement to a NookColor.  The BN app works flawlessly so I'm not losing any books or magazines I had before and have many more reading options as well (Google Books and others).  The large screen is great, video is wonderful and battery life has been solid.  The price is right too.  I've also purchased the docking keyboard for times when I want to type a lot or want even more battery life.\n\nMy only frustration with the tablet was that many sites will render a mobile version so you have this small or non-Flash version to work with on the large screen.  Some mobile versions of sites (like Seaworld com) won't allow you to do things you can do on full versions (like buy passes).  After searching \"Honeycomb desktop browser\", I discovered how to change a setting to specify \"Desktop\" rather than \"Tablet\" or \"Mobile\" mode. Websites will often treat the Tablet mode as mobile so setting it to Desktop gives you the full experience.  You have to go into debug mode on the browser to make this change.  It would be nice if this setting was more obvious and in the core OS settings panel or part of the settings menu for the browser app, but it works nonetheless."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I received my Asus yesterday, I have been using it since. I had read the reviews and done my research before buying this product. I have to say, so far there isn't anything I don't like. The cons for most would be the power cord but I don't mind it too much. The battery power is great. It definitely lasts a lot longer then my laptop I sold to buy in its place. It fits in my purse and perfect to whip out and use anywhere in a wifi area or hotspot. The one thing I dislike so far is the fingerprints left on the screen when it sleeps. The picture is beautiful and the keyboard is something I'm still getting used to but some great things take time. This tablet is quite fast and for over all results, I'm truly glad that I bought this in place of my laptop.  I am one happy customer with Amazon. They have always had the best prices and is always on time for delivery."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I have had the Asus Transformer 32GB tablet with keyboard for about 2 weeks. I do not have the battery drainage issue in the keyboard I have read about in some blogs. The battery lasts 9-10hrs without the dock 14-16hrs with the dock depending on what I am doing.\n\nPROs- Viewing angles, Price, resolution, smooth response. Free online storage- plenty of power. Great for reading, web browsing, checking email, playing games- camera is better than the reviews indicate- not as good as my evo3d. Size is perfect- 7\" is too small. The widescreen format is great for watching streaming video, or movies- sucks when typing in landscape without the dock. Flexibility is great- easily swap files over wifi (great connection), blue tooth is great.\n\nCONs- NO USB without dock. Micro SD card is working- but you can not GMAIL attach a file on the removable Micro SD. Office documents can be viewed- some can be edited- but Powerpoint files loose some of the format options when you are in editing mode- I am a sales rep and planned to use the tablet for dealer presentations- maybe I need to find the correct app, but when you open the gallery- the tablet automatically searches for every photo file on the computer- Since I also put a folder in the Micro SD with all of my personal photos on it from my laptop, I have to be careful when opening the gallery near customers to show product photos or they will want to peruse my personal images.\n  I have several other petty gripes- like the color of the back is not my style, the build quality is maybe an 7or8 out of 10. the Bezel around the screen is WIDE. Honeycomb is still a work in progress.\n\nPower cord is proprietary, and super short, and unavailable for order- don't loose it or break it...\n\nSpeakers are mounted on the sides, and suck. Invest in some nice earbuds if you have even slight background noise- say like a hotel a/c unit running on low. The speakers are also in places where you may hold the tablet rendering them useless. Also- the up volume and power buttons are very close togethet, you think you are turning up the volume and ooops, off goes the screen.\n\nOverall it is a great tablet. I can't wait to see an HTC 10\" tablet running Icecream sandwich this fall. If you are looking for something to replace your laptop hold on for a while. If you want something that has super battery life, allow you to browse the web and read email, and review office documents on the road get the Tablet.\n\nUpdate 4/4/2012\n\nI still have the tablet, and after an update to ICS (Android 4.0) it is greatly improved in performance and some of the apps have been updated and allow for more flexibility with powerpoint editing.. still no laptop replacement yet.\nBattery is still holding on strong, the touchpad is a bit sensitive when typing sometimes clicking out of the typing area.\n\nThe slot that hold the tablet in place has a little play in it now.\n\nFor those of you who are trying to decide between this and the new PRIME, it is a no brainer. Pay the extra money. It is the same size screen, in a more compact and lighter package. The screen is sooo much better, and it is much more powerful.\n\nI think I will wait for the 3gen devices to come out with android 5.0 before I jump into another tablet personally, but if you have to have one get the prime."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I would have given 5 stars except for the lack of instructions for the tablet, Android Honeycomb and applications.\n\nI have had the terminator for a couple weeks and play with it a bit each day.  I studied as many of the 10\"+ tablets as I could find info for and settled on the TL101.  Unlike many purchasers, I did not have phone experience with Android phone OS before this purchase.  I updated to 3.1 right away without trying the tablet with 3.0.  Update installed with no problems.\nThe main reason I purchased the TL101 is so I can take my movies with me to Europe since I don't speak the non-English languages shown on TV there.  I want to put the movies onto the SD cards and not stream them from a service.  I researched high and low on the internet for a successful way to do this with good quality.  The biggest problem was with the aspect ratio.  I finally found a good converter to make the movies look normal.  Only a few reviews talk about viewing movies from the sd card, and most talk in video tech speak so finding the right conversion was exhaustive.  This is the conversion that I found to work:  Using AVS Converter- Advanced Settings.  Video MPEG4 (Divx/Xvid compatible),  Frame size 800x400, Bit rate 1687, Frame Rt. Match original (shown on the left side or closest ),  Audio should match original if possible.\nI have read all the amazon.com reviews looking for helpful info.  Many have been really instructive and I wouldn't have purchased the tablet without their input.\nNow, to my other experiences with the TL101.  When I first turned the pad on, I had a screen with an open padlock in a circle and the date.  Nothing else.  I could not find any way to go beyond this screen and I could not find a screen shot of this screen in the user manual or on the Internet.  No one in the reviews mentioned this screen.  This is a page the manufacturer didn't seem to feel was important enough to include in the manual. I send an email to ASUS support and so far haven't heard from them.  Tapping on the open padlock did nothing.  It was very irritating and I got upset with it so I took my stylus and swirled it around the padlock.  Well, hallelujah, I was into the main page.  I had to go through this routine every time I started the TL101. Finally, after a couple weeks I found a couple of videos at youtube.com through explained the screen and how to use the padlock. For those unfamiliar as me, touch the padlock to make the circle appear, than move the padlock outside the circle and the tablet will open.  Every thing I read seems to assume the reader has Android phone experience and knows everything already.  New to Android users must be a very curious investigators, willing to hunt and peck their way around the OS.  I'm not a computer beginner but I have found the lack of instructions for Android and applications very unhelpful.  One thing I have not found yet is how to close an application when you no longer need it.  The only way I know of, is to shut down and restart.  I finally downloaded an application that allows me to shut an application down.  Gee developers, an X in the top corner would be very helpful.  Things that I can make work all seem to be working ok.  It's finding out how to make them work that's the problem. The wireless has been great so far and I don't seem to have the lag time others have complained about.\nAll seems fine except for the speakers, I haven't had a lot of the problems with the tablet it's self.  No dead pixels in the screen and no back light problem.  The reflection will let you use it as a mirror. I installed a screen protector and wish I had not.  I was unable to get all the bubbles out and some show when using the table.  I use a styles instead of my fingers to work the screen and that helps a lot with the fingerprints.  Response is fine. The construction seems very good to me.  The volume on the speakers is totally useless from the built-in speakers.  There is no volume at all, even with switch on high.  The volume does work better with headphones.  As with others, the right speaker is louder than the left but neither is loud enough.  I wish I could hear better without the headphones and could turn both the speaker and headset volume louder.  I will use a headset with a volume control in it.\nI have the keyboard, which I really like except again no instructions.  There is an entire row of different keys on the top without any information on what they do.  Corners on the TL101 are fine but hinge on the keyboard hurt my legs when installed and I hold it in my lap.  The keyboard makes the tablet pretty heavy which is fine with me.  I also got a Bluetooth iPad keyboard which is very light and it worked fine.  Of course it doesn't add any ports but still a decent alternative and cheaper too.\nMost of the problems are with the OS and applications and the void left by the developers.  I found an extreme lack of instructions on how things work.  Android and applications will be a real problem for beginners who are not computer or android phone literate.  Developers, get with it.  Technical writing isn't rocket science.  Basic \"how to's\" are not that complicated to write. Screen shots are also helpful. When I find an application on the Internet, sometimes I'm unable to determine exactly what the application will do for me.  Most of the applications seem to be games which I'm not interested in.  Some force you to keep your data on their server, which I'm also not interested in.  I have searched for tutorials on the Internet, but again not too helpful.\nI've tried to find out how to reach my Win7 computer through the wireless connection but that process still eludes me.  One person wrote that he made it work great with the download from the ASUS site.  I have looked high and low and can't find the file he referenced.  Again, email to support has been lost somewhere in the cosmos because I haven't heard a peep from them.\nAs stated before, I purchased my table for travel.  Most of the applications I'm looking for are travel related.  I've found a very good translator but with the sound being so low, I suspect it will be difficult for the tablet to speak the translation to a foreign language person.  I also found a very nice application that shows you the layout of major airports and where many things are located inside.  I have a year to play with it before my next trip, so hopefully more applications, with instructions, will be available and another update to the OS to fix some of the problems, like the speakers.  I'm looking forward to Skype with video and Netflix streaming video, hint, hint.\nI do love the ASUS TL101 and even with the problems, I am very happy with it. I know the technology is new and am willing to accept some lag in getting all to work well together.\n\nUpdate: 8/17/11\nThanks to all who commented on my review and provided additional tips and hints.  I wanted to update on a new problem I have encountered.  Since I got the keyboard dock, I love it so much I leave it attached to the Terminator all the time.  My battery was running down constantly while my table was turned off. I did lots of test and confirmed the battery really was draining while off.  I called ASUS support and spoke to a very nice technician.  She explained that the keyboard docking station is always on and in fact does drain the battery.  There is an option to turn this function off -  \"Settings/Screen/MobileDock Battery saving mode\".  Check this option.  Press the power button to put the tablet to sleep and then press a key on the keyboard to see if the doc also went to sleep.  If the keyboard wakes the tablet, then you have an older dock and have to send it to ASUS for a hardware upgrade.  My dock is one that needs to be returned for the upgrade. Bummer!  I haven't decided if I will do that.\nI love my TF101 and have been finding lots of applications that I really like.  It's strange to me to find free apps or to buy apps for just a few dollars since I am used to spending hundreds. I don't mind paying the small amounts to help developers or to eliminate the advertising.\n\nThere has been an Android 3.nn upgrade recently.  It has not done much to help the low volume on the speakers. Another bummer. I plugged the tablet into an HDMI television with the mini cable and the picture/sound was  better than expected for an .mp4 formatted movie."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "There are many tablets out there. I'm not going to go into the technical details and so forth - everyone has their own opinions about it. After much research and testing them out at stores, I settled on the Asus Transformer based on a couple of reasons that I feel are important to me. So for those that have similar concerns as I do, then you can find out more.\n\nI travel frequently for business and I wanted some light, easy to use, surfing the net, and when I need to - type a lot of emails. I do not need to use it for heavy graphics or software that requires heavy processing, so a tablet to replace my netbook was a great idea. What was really great was the idea of the optional keyboard being able to attach to the tablet. When I need to, I can just attach the keyboard for heavy typing. And when I don't need to, such as lounging around by the pool or waiting at the airport gate, I can use the tablet itself. This for me was a huge plus!\n\nAnother factor that propel me to the Transformer was the memory - Some times I may have documents, pictures or other office files that I need and this allow me transfer/save without any issues. I'm not about to email large files back and forth just to get it onto my tablet.\n\nOverall the tablet performed better than I expected and worked. There was some sluggishness to it when using it, but I encountered that when I was testing other tablets as well. Not sure if this is a common thing. I thought its a great and easy to use product that I brought another one for my mother to use. So would I recommend it - yes!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I returned this product back to Amazon (Great customer service! No Hassles!) and here are my reasons why.\n\nPros:\n1. The Price.\n2. Honeycomb 3.1 (Nicely designed by Google, ASUS has not messed with it)\n3. MicroSD card for expandable storage.\n\nCons:\n1. Build quality - This was much better than I had expected while reading other reviews, but still not up to the mark. Some creaking observed with its plastic back cover. I also had some light bleed issues at the bottom of the screen while watching YouTube videos in landscape. The speaker issue has been well documented but it did not bother me much.\n\n2. Sluggishness - Generally, very smooth, but I observed lag when reading image heavy PDFs. (BTW, Polaris Office is the best app to read PDFs on this tablet), very distracting and the major factor which moved me towards returning the tablet.\n\n3. Lack of apps - The Honeycomb tablet market is dead, and if developers have not started developing for the android tablets 4 months into the launch, it is not a good sign. This is obviously not a knock on ASUS, but should be a factor when deciding to buy this.\n\n4. The cameras are not good at all, very grainy in the absence of sufficient light.\n\nI did a head-to-head comparison with my friend's iPad2 and the $100 premimum for the iPad2 is well justified in my opinion. Sadly, I had hoped this would not be the case, as I own an Android phone and love it, but cannot justify buying this."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I love the Wifi Android tablets that are now appearing on the market.  I have recently tried both the Motorola Xoom and this Asus Eee Pad Transformer thus far.\n\nPros: I like the features of the Asus to include, installed memory (16 or 32 GB), Micro SD slot that works (unlike the Xoom's that has one but doesn't work), the weight, clarity of the display, speed of the processor, location of the buttons/switches, battery life and unique color and texture design of the exterior.  The best feature that makes it rise above the rest is the $149.00 add-on accessary; the keyboard/docking station.  It enables the Eee Pad to run longer, adds two USB 2 slots,(although I wish they were USB 3)and an additional SD memory slot.  When devices are connected they appear and are ready for use quickly.\n\nCons:  I am disappointed and most frustrated that Asus decided to give this device a proprietary and unique power connector.  Most Android mobile devices out there are powered/recharged via a Micro USB connector.  Asus has regretfully decided to go down a different path as did Motorola Xoom.  This would not be so bad but there are no other vendors selling it.  With so many similar items out this could be the deciding factor for consumers, it is for me.  I thought Asus would be smarter than that.  I think it's a BIG mistake! In today's competative economy consumers are not looking for unique but would greatly appreciate commonality and usefulness, not to mention eco-waste in having to produce more odd stuff only good for one item and increase the number of connectors and cords to carry with our mobile devices.  Mobile devices are power hungry and spend much of their useful time on a charger. Also the device size is just different enough from other 10\" tablets that very few of the accessaries like cases and screen protectors are not compatable. The additional width on the sides of the frame is apparently non functional (i.e. not required for features to work) and does not improve the handling feel nor qualities of the device.  I thought smaller is better in this catagory of device.  Also unless it gets more popular other vendors will not make accessories for it, like an OtterBox case,  and there are very few available today.  Lastly my device arrived with Adroide 3.01 and an old firmware version and the \"system update\" feature says there are \"no updates available\".  There is no published nor easy method to update the firmware and I have a ticket into Asus Tech support for a solution.  The Android OS version should be 3.1 as it is advertised and present on the Xoom.\n\n  In conclusion, the Asus Eee Pad Transformer is a good effort but requires the keyboard/docking station and some needed design tweaks to rise above the rest."}

My Transformer has some of the common QC issues that have been mentioned in various places (some light bleed on the screen and slightly unbalanced speakers).  However, those minor issues are not enough of a problem to stop me from enjoying the rest of the great functionality that the tablet provides.  I don't mind being an early adopter and although there are some apps that I wish would get ported to Honeycomb (from iOS), there are very few things that I haven't been able to find high quality apps for.  I can't give the Transformer 5 stars due to the QC issues, but I really would recommend considering this tablet, especially for the price.  Asus was great about getting the 3.1 update out quickly which makes me hopeful that 3.2 will be coming soon as well.  It really can only get better from here on out.  I see new apps being optimized for tablets weekly which means that more developers are starting to see the potential for this market.  Just get it!  You will not regret it (but your spouse may get jealous)."}

I have had the Asus Transformer (no keyboard) for about a month. I use it about an hour a day to check email, read the news, play games, search the internet and play internet radio.\nGreat machine. Voice command, screen clarity and touch sensibility, battery life, WIFI stability are great.  Speakers are not loud enough, so use earphones or external amp/speakers. No USB\nAbout 18 months later.\nLast year at this time I gave the tablet to my sister.  She used it primarily for Facebook, email, news and board games.  She really enjoyed it just as I did. She dropped it last month and now it will only glow for a few seconds when you press the power button. Nothing else.  The Asus people say they do not repair tablets."}

They do both get you to where you want to go however the ride is quite different and so is the price tag!  The EEEpad seems like the glass is a bit jerky and has been pulled off an old building and the movement of windows is also jerky and it's not nearly as responsive to touches and pinches but it works OK, is also less responsive to the ipad which has glass that is amazingly smooth as is the window movement responses to touch and pinching. Both are a bit harsh on the eyes and the EEEPad is noticeably harder on the eyes even with brightness turned down.  I feel they are damaging my eye site! I prefer the Browser on the EEEPad as it acts like a normal browser.  The IPad has no tags which is annoying.  The EEEPad also allows you to go instantly to other open apps without having to return to the desktop.  The Ipad always demands you go to the desktop. The EEEPads battery does not seem to last as long as the Ipads apparently the Ipad 2 lasts even longer.\nNO Flash for Ipad is a real bumber.  EEEpad has flash though quality and speed are not as good as videos you can watch with Ipad that get around the need for flash there arn't that many apart from the u tube app.\nI have a laptop and could never understand why you would need a pad of any sort.  However because my wife bought an Ipad I mucked around with it and found it to be very lifestyle friendly especially whilst watching TV.  For some reason my light laptop just feels like hard work having it on my lap, on battery in front of the TV. The Pads are cool.  They don't feel like they are taxing you, there just there to muck around with.  You just chuck onto the couch next to you when you have finished with it and just pick them up and check things out again as ideas come to you from the TV or what ever.  So easy not having to boot up etc.  This surprised me and turned me positive on them.\nThe problem however is that you tend to have them resting on your thighs and so your head is tilted sharply down and this gives you a pain in the neck if you use them regularly and will in time cause you spinal issues!!  That's really bad!  Don't take this lightly!!  You can kind of hold it up in front of you but this is a bit hard on the arms and limits your thumb typing capacities etc.  On that note the Ipad is cleverly syzed in that you can get all the keys with your thumbs when in landscape mode.  The EEEpad is wider and slightly thinner so you can't reach the middle keys with your thumbs in landscape mode. Given the spinal issues the comfort and ease of it is a bit tricky in that is going to cause you lasting problems whilst tricking you with it's seeming lifestyle friendly ease.\nSo not such a good idea after all especially as it's probably making you blind slowly as well!\nUsed in short short bursts whilst holding it up is OK I suppose.  Not serious work machines, that's for sure.\nWhat would be useful to know is also how much these things are actually costing you in terms of power usage.  I am sure that continually recharging batteries is more expensive than things that just run or normal power.  This is a hidden cost that should be rated and disclosed!  You don't seem to be able to get this info on any of all these battery recharging devices.  It time that could be costing you far more than the cost of the device itself.  Tricky aren't they!!"}

My wife has been and still is a long term health care patient since april /22 / 2011 after heart bypass surgery because of infection to her chest incision. Due to long term bed care and sedation she is somewhat weak. She has a trach in her throat and cannot speak. This wonderful tablet has let her communicate with friends and family. This tablet has brought much happiness to someone who is alone during the day while everyone is at work and at nite after visting hrs. This tablet picks up hospital wifi very good even on the tenth floor. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone in a similar situation.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I was researching for a Tablet for last few months. After reading many Reviews finally I purchased The Asus Transformer 10.1\" last month Through Amazon.com. I have used Asus Eee PC net-Book 901 and 1008 clamshell with Ubuntu and Windows XP operating system, And T-mobile Samsung Galaxy S 4G Phone. Compare to all this, I had some good and not so good remarks about The ASUS Eee Pad 10.1\" Transformer.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S Phone (Android 2.2) even though it is small in size, plays most of the Videos Movies, Youtube Mpeg, Flv, and all Videos, Audio Quality, Head Phone & external speaker are excellent. ASUS Eee Pad 10.1\" Transformer has problems playing many YouTube Videos, Flv files and many WMV videos. Both of other Asus net-books one with Ubuntu, and other with Win XP did hot have any problem.\n\nSince I had the Samsung Galaxy with Android 2.2 With 1 GZ Processor Humming bird, I thought The ASUS Transformer Eee Tab with 1GB memory and Android 3.1 Operating system will be much better, Actually I am kind of not so happy with The Video Quality with the ASUS Eee 10.1 Tab It plays movies downloaded no problem. Most of other things I tested are good. Wi Fi connect-ability Internet Browsing etc.. are excellent. All the Testings are done with Bose and Audio Technica Head phones.\n\nAlso I tried the Computer Monitor Speakers (Bose) with all the 4 Items, The Transformer did not meet my expectation. It worked all right, but some lack of Audio quality was there, I don't know weather it is sound level / audio processing. The video Crispiness, I felt it was low for LED ok for LCD. The touch screen feels solid and strong, worked well. I believe that the Future Software upgrades should fix all these Issues.\n\nThe most important thing I did not like on this is it's power cord (3 feet ?) this is the shortest power cord I ever seen. It will charge the battery only from the Charger came with. Will not charge even if you are connected to another computer with the USB cord. Looks like these are Brand issues.\n\nI was thinking to buy the Samsung Tab because I had excellent experience with The Galaxy S every feature has exceeded my expectation. You can connect it to any computer USB port and it will charge. The ASUS Transformer will connect to other Computer no problem, but it will not charge the Battery. Other Thing if you use a usb extension Cord, then it will not charge even through the original charger."}

I am not an IPAD fan because it cannot play flash and not able to expand storage/memory, so I am looking for Android Tablet. But I eneded up returning the Asus because a major flaw.\n\nHere are the good:\n- Clear and Sharp Screen\n- Android 3.1 update initiated automatically, don;t have to update manually\n- Polaris Office that opens windows office files (not available on Android Market).\n\nHere are the not so good:\n\n- Battery - No charging indicator. So you do not know if the charge is complete or not.\n- Sometimes the unit fail to charge because of the loose charger connection to usb charger. I read a lot of complaints on this.\n\nI returned the unit because the touch screen is not responsive. Later on I found that there are many complaints on this issue on Android discussion forum. The temporary remedy of this issue is to drain the battery. But draining the battery on idle screen can take days.\n\nIn conslusion, if you get a reliable unit, this is certainly the adroid tablet you want to buy ( I chose Asus over  Acer iconia and Samsung Galaxy) But beware of some reliability issues.\n\nHope this helps."}

It beats the Ipad hands down in terms of its features and functionality.  The one place where it falls a bit short is in terms of its build quality.\n\nThe plastic back is textured and nice to hold but creaks a bit on one side.  It is also a bit heavier than the Ipad2, which makes a difference when you hold the product for a long time.  The battery life also is a bit shorter than the Ipad but it does not bother me.  If Asus can fix the first two problems and add a USB port I will give it 5 stars.\n\nOne other issue not directly related to the product is there are not enough choice of third party accessories and the ASUS accessories are a bit overpriced."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I like my new AT but there are some things to get used to and know about before you buy it.  First, sometimes the keyboard works fine and other times it just stops working. Don't bother trying to figure it out just switch to the tablet and for some reason the next time you use the keyboard it's OK.  Also, I just assumed that there would be an app for Netflix and an App for ooVoo. WRONG!  I have an Acer One Netbook that is cheaper and is 3 years old and has no problems w/ooVoo or Netflix. I hook the Acer up to the TV all the time to use both on a 57 inch screen.\nYet the AT is fun to play with and it seems like every day I learn something new. (YouTube has some good videos on the AT) When the keyboard is working it's fast. You can also go back and forth between touching the screen w/your fingers and using the keyboard.  The picture quality is excellent. Everything is in sync w/Google so it's nice to be able to move from one Google App to another w/ease. It also has great sound.\nIf I had to do it all over again however I would have bought an Apple I Pad 2 for fun and then used my Acer One for Word and Windows for work."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I will leave the specs out of this review and focus on the highlights of my experience.\n\nFirst, this is a good value if you get it online (no tax, free shipping).\n\nI also own a Samsung Galaxy 10.1 and the Galaxy is noticeably faster and very much lighter and thinner.  The Asus works well though.  For 100 dollars, if you don't care, get a higher end model in my opinion.  This is a decent tablet when it's fully functional.  The buttons aren't in the best place, but it's not tragic.  It does have a good basic case that you can get that I like very much.  A lot of other tablets suffer from lack of accessories.\n\nNow, there is a very common problem with the screen locking up on a black screen.  Most users are able to hard reset the device or work some magic by holding down the power button, then counting to 10 then letting it go and counting to two....it's crazy.  Apparently even with updates Asus is unable to figure this out and correct it. I find this unacceptable.  I read a few hundred posts on various message boards and every user seems to have a different experience with how it occurs and how to fix it. I was unable to fix mine and I had to send it back to where I got it, but they won't take returns only exchanges so now I have one of these to sell when I get my new one.\n\nAsus makes good stuff and I have a lot of their products.  This common black screen problem put a very sour taste in my mouth and forced me to another product, which I like more. I have the extra 100 to spend so it isn't an issue for me."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I like the idea of dockable tablet but did not order the keyboard dock as I first wanted to try the tablet. I also liked the idea of having the microSD slot to bump the memory to 64GB. I also liked the idea of being able to play flash content (yes, I need it I watch Indian movies online on sites that host them only with flash).\nSo those are the reasons for buying this one. I used it for a month and then returned it. Why?\nWell here is why..\n\nI did not like the volume output when I watch movies (just felt it is not enough). If you want to watch a movie without using earphones you will find the output is not good enough to enjoy the movie.\n\nI did not like the thickness and weight compared to competition (galaxy tab).\n\nNoticed the lag and slow/hag when doing multiple programs (along with running the live wallpapers like that water thing). This could be the case with all android's.\n\nCould never get the MyNet (access files on my PC sharing the same wifi network) to work.\n\nThe cloud tools supplied by ASUS are half baked solutions.\n\nAndroid is still not ready (but these will be the same with any honeycomb tablet unless competitors like Samsung are fixing issues and filling missing pieces along with their custom layers like TouchWiz and good quality apps)\nLack of a good free video player (that won't crash and plays all my avi files well with AC3 audio encoding) is bummer. The default video player is a joke and the 3rd parties are buggy.\nI still need a f**** task manager to kill/stop an application?? how stupid?? A flick on webOS stops the apps.. when will Android make it that easy??\n\nSo returned this one last week and just ordered the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1. I am ready to live with the honeycomb difficulties as I have hope it will improve. Lack of the microsd slot is a bummer on that one. I will try it for another month and return it if I don't like it (if issues outweigh the benefits of weight and size).\n\nThis does not mean that I won't go back to ASUS transformer again. Just that I want to try the competition before I settle with one. ASUS transformer is a well built tablet and it is $100 less so it is worth every penny.\n\nHave to mention this for all those iFans (I am no fan of any company, I think competition between these companies will benefit the end user like me).. iPad2 is still the best tablet out there for the shear volume of apps and quality of hardware but it is not for me because my internet still did not migrate to HTML5. And I tend to get a feeling that Apple still owns my device even after I paid for it.\n\nLenovo Ideapad K1 is another tablet on my list to try before settling with one."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I LOVE THIS TABLET.  The hardware is excellent.  The build quality is solid, even with the plastic back the Transformer doesn't feel cheap. The LED backlight screen is gorgeous; however there is a lot of light bleed.  The light bleed is only noticeable in the dark with a dark background. You won't even notice the light bleed if you're not looking for it. I personally think this is a non issue. The screen is a finger print magnet; you will need to clean it with a 3M cloth. The only issue I have with the hardware is, this thing is heavy, after an hour or so in the hand you will have to set it down.  The Asus transformer weighs a lot; this maybe an issue for female users. The picture quality is good, not great in broad daylight.  HD video playback is pretty good but I did notice a little pixelation. The internal speakers SUCK, they sound like tin cans, but the sound was awesome with a good set of headphones.  The battery life is about 9 hours. I tether this device with my HTC Evo on 4G, the speeds are EXCELLENT\n\nThe software is amazing.  I find 3.1 Android OS very response.  The Google Apps that come pre-installed make this a viable laptop replacement.  Gmail, Google Music beta, Polaris Office, Google Docs, Asus MyCloud and Dropbox combine to make this a very powerful device.  With these apps combined, limited device storage (16gigs) space is a non issue. My only issue with the software is limited apps. There are simply not that many apps. I really miss Flipboard for the iPAD.  Pulse is a good substitute for Flipboard but it lacks the fit and finish.\nOverall, for the price this is hands down the best Android tablet on the market right now. This device is as good and in some ways better than the iPAD1. With a few minor tweeks and more apps the next version of this tablet will be an iPAD killer."}

Additionally the applications were crashing, unpredictible and Honey comb looked in a pitifull state. I know eventually the software problems would go away, however you don't want to be a beta tester when you are paying more than $400; its just not ethically and morally correct!\n\nFirst thing I did next morning was I got it replaced with an Ipad2.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "There are a ton of reviews on this tablet.  I currently own an ipad 1 and was on the fence on getting an ipad 2, toshiba thrive, HP Touchpad or this one.\n\nHP Touchpad seemed sluggish compared to this tablet, I really wanted to like the HP touchpad.\n\nToshiba Thrive felt like it would fall apart, very plastic feel.\n\nSince both Toshiba and Asus has the same OS, it really came down to personal preference.  I liked the Galaxy 10.1 tab, but without all the optional ports, it really wasn't comparable.\n\nWhat I really like on the Asus is the battery life and the optional keyboard dock which provides a boat load of additional flexibility.\n\nTablet, by itself is responsive and good battery life.  I added the 32 GB micro SD card for a total of 64 GB.  Video via HDMI out on a 55\" lcd tv worked without problems.\n\nWhat I really like is the added keyboard which contains 2 USB ports, extra battery and full size SD Card reader.\n\nThe extra battery charges the tablet as a priority so if you want to take the tablet off, it will be charged and ready to go.\n\nThe tablet had no issues with reading my USB 1.5 TB drives.  The SD Card reader will not read XC cards, so 64 GB cards are out, but it should read 32 GB cards.  So a total of 96 GB can be had between he keyboard and tablet.\n\nThe tablet is responsive, although a lot of the aps aren't ready for honeycomb, it shouldn't be too long.  I have the aps that I need, so I'm not too concerned.  I like that it also already includes an ap for editing and reading office documents.  I take this to meetings and document meeting notes on it.\n\nOnly downside I don't like is the slippery feel of the plastic backing on the tablet, but other than that, so far, haven't had any issues.  Keyboard integration is great.\n\nBest part is having the flexibility.  I like the fact of not having to carry extra wires and dongles just to hook up to a card reader or to display video on a screen.  I also am able to tether this to my cell phone via wireless blue tooth for wireless access when I'm on the road."}

I am guessing because downloaded applications may conflicted the Hardware.  I wholelly reset the tablet but problem remains.  I have no choice so I ask for return just because Amazon has no remaining in stock for exchange.  I plan to purchase another 32 gb version very soon, hopefully the volume control issue was just merely a special case, but not really the issue.  I strongly wish Asus can have 7 inch display available, that will be perfect for portable use in the office."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "This review is coming from the perspective of owning the transformer for 14 days and now the tab for about 10.\n\nScreen quality: they are both imo just as nice but the tab is suppose to have the better screen on paper but its a toss up really.\n\nBattery life: I felt that the Tab has a much better battery life. I used both for very similar purposes and at the end of the day my tab would have about 75-65% battery and the transformer would be in the 40-30% range. (this is with wireless always on). Only way i felt the battery life on the transformer would match the tab is if i had it set to turn the wireless off when screen is off and even still the battery would get really low.\n\nSound: The sound on these are not great to begin with but i would have to say from my experience the sound on the Tab is much much better than the transformer. The tab i can have things at about half volume and hear everything just fine were as the transformer i had it 100% the whole time and had trouble hearing some youtube videos.\n\nOverall design: The thing that annoyed me the most about the transformer was the power button. It was very easily pressed and when i would put it in my sleeve a lot of the times it would be turn on while in my bag or just carrying it around and would drain the heck out of the battery. The tab has no such issues. While the transformer has the option to add an external sd card as well as the option for the dock with extra battery and keyboard i don't think its a huge edge. 16gb or 32gb is a lot of space and its really not practical to put a ton of music on there and use it as a mp3 player and if u plan on watching movies u can just swap media in and out as you please so its not a huge issue.\n\nAs you may have heard the keyboard dock(transformer) has a lot of battery draining problems and key press registering problems. If the dock was a big draw for you in getting the transformer, trust me the novelty of it gets old. If you wanted a net book you would have bought a net book or better yet a laptop. I had the dock and didn't really find it that great as most of the time I'm laying down just checking email watching videos or reading forums etc... things that don't require a physical keyboard. If i need to type a lot ill just get on my laptop or my computer and go to town.\n\nAs far as having an extra battery that extends battery life, i mean i guess that's a plus but unless your going to be away from a power source, and let face it not very many people will be away from one for more then 24 hours, you don't really need the extra battery. To me it was more of a cool factor like ... wow i can use this for 16 hours and not have to charge it. But once i realized i was charging it every night when i went to bed i realized it was kind of pointless. i guess for the rare 2-3 times a year where u might need 16ish hours of battery power i guess its cool.\n\nAnother thing i wanted to note was the weight and thickness to the transformer. I kind of thought it was just about right, not to heavy but not so light that you wouldn't have a good grip on it and just thick enough to have something to hold on to. While the tab is really thin and light i kind of liked the transformers heft and thickness.\n\nFinal thoughts: Both are great Toys, cause lets face it that's all they really are. For the money the transformer is a great deal, 100 bucks less than the tab and pretty much the same features, with additional options like the dock. If money is a non-issue I'd go with the Tab 100% of the time. If your looking for tablet and are a little short on money i would get the transformer.\n\nReason i gave it 3 stars is because the power button, the speakers/sound, i thought the battery life while still good wasn't up to par compared to the Tab, web browsing was laggy and in the end i returned it to try the Samsung Galaxy tab 10.1 and like it much better."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I've been hesitant to jump into the world of tablets. I have a desktop PC, which serves as my home server and backups. I have a laptop which has become my \"desktop replacement.\" I have an Android Phone which really comes in handy and makes me productive. And I have an iPhone4 issued my by work. So, why would I need a tablet? Isn't it just a big \"Smartphone\" as I would often tell people? While my opinion hasn't changed about it being a big Smartphone minus the phone, as far as tablets go, you cannot go wrong with this one.\n\nThe tablet itself is very well built and comfortable to hold. It may seem heavier than expected but you do get used to it. The screen is very vibrant and the touch screen is very responsive. The best thing, for me, about this table is the MicroSD slot. Why the iPad and Samsung Tab 10.1 left these off is a mystery. I like to have my complete photo collection with me and NOT in the cloud, so the MicroSD slot is a major plus for me. Typing on it as good but not great and there seems to be some lag on a few websites.\n\nHoneycomb is a joy to use and I can't wait to see how it evolves. The interface is very intuitive and the customization (widgets, etc.) options are very good for a new operating system. The Email app is quite nice to use and the Google calendar interface is excellent. There aren't many tablet specific apps out there but the ones I've used so far (TapTu, Words With Friends) are quite good.\n\nNow, as far as a practical use for my tablet, I have really yet to find one. I really wanted an e-reader but didn't want to be limited with the Kindle or Nook, so having the option for both of those readers on my Phone with the robust options of Android make it a no brainer and it brings my tablet closer to being practical. It is a ton of fun to do surfing, social networking and email reading while relaxing. So if relaxing is practical, then I've found my reason!!\n\nI've not experienced any problems with this tablet. Rarely a force close, no light bleeding, no sudden reboots. This is a quality tablet and I highly recommend it if you are in the market for one."}

The only missing on this device is a USB port.  It has a Micro SD port and works really good.  I simply took the Micro SD off the camera and slide it into this device and bam! there they are.  MP4 player works ok but the picture did not fill up the entire screen.  I wonder if anyone know why the screen is smaller when playing the MP4 movies converting from AVS4YOU ripped from your original dvd.  Pricewise, no other touch pad company can beat it.  My suggestion to ASUS is to provide it with a USB port, a hand strap to keep it from falling off my hand, and another model with 7\" screen so it is easy to carry around in my pocket.  I forgot to mention about the picture quality: Excellent.\nKudo to ASUS."}

The weight is just right, it could be slightly lighter weight but with the materials they used its fine. The screen is gorgeous, very high resolution makes images seem very crisp and bright. I tend to keep my brightness turned all the way down to conserve battery life and its still very acceptable with it all the way down. Battery life is pretty good. I use mine off and on throughout the day and leave it in sleep mode a lot and I tend to get a day and half or so. Boot up takes about 15 to 20 seconds and once its on its very quick and snappy.

People say that there are not enough apps for Honeycomb (3.1), LIES, LIES, LIES.\nThere are plenty of free and paid apps.\nOut of the box, you get the standard Google apps, Polaris Office, My Cloud (with SplashTop Remote, which I used to control my other computers), you get the GPS (I used it for our trip to Myrtle Beach), and many many more.\n\nIt's a definite winner, best Pad out there at this time."}

I had been in line toget it the very first day it was offered and while it is an adequate device for meia consumption it has its flaws. Things that I was willing to live with on a smaller screen just bothered me too much on iPad. The really small amoutn of RAM was also something that immediately caused issues (it has 256 Mb of RAM half of what is available on iphone 4). I had been waiting for Another tablet device to fix teh issues with iPad and Asus seemed to have delivered. A battery life that was comparable to iPad. An OS that was designed from the ground up for tablet (honeycomb) and an accessory (dock) that seemed to fix everything the device was lacking (keyboard, extra battery, extra expansion ports). On the surface Asus Transformer is an excellent replacement for iPad.\n\nIt is, however, not a perfect device yet. I 'll admit majority of the issues are software related and should be fixed with the next release (Icecream sandwich). The Tegra processor is fast and 1GB of memory is enough to open a lot of pdfs without any issue. The screen is gorgeous and the soft touch back makes it easy to hold. 10.1\" 16:9 ratio screen however is a bit unwieldy but since this is the resolution every Android tablet (to date) has; it is not something you can fix by getting another device. To me 4:3 screen of iPad makes it easy to hold in any orientation and Android tablets' 16:9 screen make it more suited for landscape use.\n\nI am still not a fan of multitasking the way either iOS or Android do however, Honeycomb does it better than iOS. There is still a lack of tablet specific apps (even after 3 months) but I have been able to find apps for everything that I usually use my tablet for. That said some notable exceptions are Netflix, Hulu Plus, Flipboard or Zinio (I am using \"your version\" as a replacement which is pretty good).\n\nI am pretty impressed with the sound coming out of this tablet which is stereo and generally better than iPad. Asus Keyboard was not that great but I have since then replaced it with \"thumb keyboard\" which works very well. I have not tried to take any pictures with the rear camera yet but the front facing camera is pretty good."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I purchased this tablet for my stepson's High School graduation; I've also had a chance to use it myself.\n\nI checked many reviews, both professional and owner, before selecting this tablet; in addition, I\n\"played\" with it and many of its competitors as well.  Based on my experience with this, as well as 30 years of professional experience as a software engineer, I have come to the conclusion that it is the best tablet available today, period.\n\nThe build, as is normal with Asus products, is excellent.  The back is textured, making it easy to hold (and resistant to fingerprints), the front is clean and solid (they used Corning Gorilla Glass for the surface), and the display is excellent.  It supports expansion via microSD cards (I purchased a 16GB class 10 card with it; that is much more cost effective than getting the TF101-B model).\n\nIt also has an option for a keyboard dock that contains additional ports, a second battery (almost doubles the battery life to 16 hours),  and good quality keyboard.  Because of the battery the keyboard lists at $150 (look around and don't settle for one that's marked up higher due to the speed at which these sell out).  When combined, the keyboard and tablet \"transform\" into a small notebook computer.  The \"cool\" factor for this unique feature is excellent -- no other tablet has been designed this well both technically and aesthetically.\n\nIt is Wi-Fi only; probably an advantage since it reduces the temptation to lock one's self into a long term data plan, and the network works well.\n\nIt comes with Android 3.0 installed, but immediately updates itself to 3.1 when connected to a network.  Performance is quick, and the Android environment is polished.  It also comes with Android Marketplace installed; it can also be used with other non vendor-specific app stores.  Note that Asus has shipped 1 million of these so far, and with the difficulty finding them at list price, clearly they are selling, not just shipping.\n\nIf you are thinking about getting a tablet, be sure to check this one out before buying another one.  You will be glad you did.\n\nBTW, my stepson doesn't refer to this as a \"tablet\"; he calls it his \"fondle slab\".  Clearly he likes it."}

Compared to an iPad, the Android system allows more flexibility and customization, which I liked.  Nonetheless, I must return it.  I have three crucial uses for a tablet--connecting to MS Exchange,  syncing with OneNote, and streaming TV and media.  All three are problematic in this operating system.  Exchange required a secondary app (TouchDown) which worked intermittently, OneNote never did connect, and Android 3 is not supported by Netflix, Hulu, or other streaming services.  For two weeks, I tried various secondary apps and scoured message boards to find work-arounds but none worked successfully or smoothly, whereas all three work instantly with an iPad, right out of the box.  Unfortunately, I didn't find any discussions of these issues before purchasing, and have no more time to keep working on them. If you don't need these programs or have more Android patience and expertise then I do, then this is a great tablet and I wish you well.\n\nBTW, I do appreciate Amazon's generous return policy."}

The directions must be downloaded before hand. It can re-route small changes; but bigger changes require network access. If you can tether it to your phone, or 3G/4G access-point then you will have no issue.\n\nNext I am planning to buy the dock. I have seen the dock with my friend at work and he told me that after the firmware upgrade of the dock, all the issues have been resolved. He has stopped using his laptop and has been using this as his laptop at work with the dock. The transformer comes with office suite, so it has all he cares about; and he does the the presentations using HDMI. It has replaced his laptop completely.\n\nUsing GOOD Technology SW you can access your company e-mail, if your IT supports it. It almost does for all major corporations as many people are using it on Iphone and Android already.\n\nI love the live widgets. Integration of gmail is good. Weather widget uses GPS, so I got the Maui's local weather when I had it with me. MyZyne widget from ASUS adds slideshow, so I have my pictures from the trip showing up on the screen.\n\nDuring slideshow using the gallery app shows pictures and the preview-snapshot-of-the-video as well. Thus it covers times when you took the video instead of the snap. I enjoy this as it means the slideshow is not a mix of photo+video; but a smooth slideshow with pan+zoom transitions.\n\nUsing DLNA support I am able to access my media available on Win7 PC and vice versa.\n\nI am controlling my Roku using the tablet, and thus using it like a touch remote.\n\nFlash plays well on all the web-sites that I have visited, so I can have the full web experience unlike the Ipad. Kids can go to pbskids.org and other sites.\n\nOverall, its fast/responsive and I live it over Ipad/ipad2 as it has microSD, flash support, host usb support (connect your camera/printer using the dock). You can buy a ACER tablet which has the host usb port on the tablet. Lots of good apps available on the Android market.\n\nI love it, and so do the kids."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Is it absolutely necessary to have this? Truth is, a small laptop is probably significantly more useful. Is it fun? Oh, yes!\n\nI just want to point out a few things about this tablet. There are already so many reviews, I just want to highlight a few points.\n\n1. Cable is proprietary. Since it needs to dock with the keyboard / battery, I guess that's not surprising. What's disappointing is that it is impossible to find anyone selling that cable right now. Cable is also rather short, and it appears that you cannot use a normal USB extension cable to make it longer. Edit : Luyen has noted that you can use a USB 3.0 extension cable.\n\n2. Charger is proprietary. It does not appear to be a standard 5V USB charger, even though the connector on the unit appears to be a USB port. I'm not sure what fireworks might result if I plug a normal USB cable into it and attempt to charge a normal device. From research on the web, the voltage output appears to be around 12V.\n\n3. A charger with cable is available from Asus for $40, but listed as out of stock everywhere I looked. Charging through USB is possible (with the proprietary cable) but only if the unit is in sleep mode.\n\n4. Headphones / mic is the same connector (a TRRS connector). It is a 3.5mm port.\n\n5. There is no 5 GHz radio. I run my 802.11n on 5 GHz only and it cannot see that SSID.\n\n6. Update to 3.1 is painless. My unit was delivered with 3.0, and after I've configured the wireless network, it picked up the update automatically, and installed it after asking me.\n\nSo far it has been a pleasure playing with this.\n\nUpdate on 9/23 :\n\nHave this for over 2 months now, and I find myself using it very often (for hours every day). Being able to grab the tablet and check email or look up something online anytime I want is fantastic. Entering text is still a pain, even with the keyboard. I have a BT mouse, works great with the tablet - except that I can't configure it for left hand use. Android has some rough edges still, you can work around them, but don't expect everything to \"just work\". Skype video, for example, just don't work. Netflix works, but playback looks grainy, and you can't install it from market yet. You need to get the apk and sideload it.\n\nIt's running on Android 3.2 right now. All updates were applied smoothly - as they should be.\n\nAccessories are starting to get more popular. I'm finally receiving my USB dongle today, which allows me to connect USB accessories (like flash drives, card readers) directly to the tablet without the dock.\n\nNo, I'm not prepared to give up my desktop and laptop, but now I'm not prepared to give up the tablet either."}

They don't have pre-order, waiting list. nothing... So even if it becomes available it is possible that you miss the chance to get yours...\nI have now a totally useless $500 tablet and no answer or solution from Asus.\nSo my advice is just go for one with usb connectors o at least non original alternative replacement parts.\n\nUpdate - July 20th:\nAfter several emails between Asus and me still no solution, the charger is still out of stock and Asus is not offering any alternative.\nFirst they said that ETA for the charger was July 12th, then July 26th and now August 15th... not serious.\nSo, al least 2 months waiting for a charger with the tablet on a shelf.\nAnother thing, I wrote reviews on Asus eStore for the tablet and the charger and they didn't publish them (I am sure they received them beacuse I got an answer with the August 15th new ETA).\nWorst customer service I've ever seen."}

I have had it a few weeks now.\n\nI have a window mount for this, and use it also as a GPS device here in Germany.  It is extremely accurate when I use the CoPilot Live 8 app!  No matter where I have been in the US or here in Germany, I have picked up the GPS satellites in the matter of seconds.\n\nI just decided to buy the keyboard from best buy online, and it arrived the other day.  Now, this thing is unbelievable.  It is the perfect sized net-book to take to the local coffee shops and cafe's.  It doubles the battery life also!  They say 16 hours, but have not tested that one.  Let's just say it is definitely LONG ENOUGH.  I also bought a Griffin Stylus from amazon.com, and am super happy with that as well.\n\nPertaining to Apps from the Marketplace, they all have worked well for me.  No matter if they have been Audio/Video/photography/document editing/etc, they have all worked on my transformer.\n\nThe one thing that I am hoping for very soon from ASUS are more accessories.  Right now, the tablet comes with one Charger cable.  Also, must use USB 3.0 charger blocks.  It would be nice to pick up an extra charger cable in case I lose the one that came with the tablet!  Other than the lack of accessories, this thing ROCKS!  I love it, and especially like the GPS feature of this Tab.  I am learning to do new things every single day on this!"}

I think the iPad is probably out the box awesome but in the long haul I would feel handcuffed by it.  I love the customization that Android affords.  This is a 5 star product for me but maybe not for everyone.  For example, I didn't think the volume worked all that great so I researched the forums and found a great app.  It was an extra dollar out of my pocket.  Is that an issue or not?  I suppose for some people it would be.  I already knew what I might be in store for because I researched a lot of tablets before buying (from forums, Amazon and other retail reviews, etc.).  Some potential issues were specific to the tablet and some were specific to Honeycomb.  To be honest, I don't feel that I have had any real issues with it.  Also, I know there are other more robust tablets out there but I felt this was the perfect value for what I wanted to use it for.  Not a day has gone by that I haven't used it.  Or watched my nephew use it, patiently waiting for his bed time..."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "The Transformer has been one of the best purchases I have made in a while. Some people complain about the plastic back; I like it! It is about the same weight as the iPad but looks prettier. The wide screen makes it a lot easier to watch HD movies (which I routinely stream from my PC with uPNPplay). I should probably mention the near identical specs to the Xoom but in a prettier package for a much lower price.\n\nAndroid's music player isn't great, so don't expect it to replace your mp3 player. Only flaws so far: some minor light bleeding around the edge (about two spots), a metallic rattle in the left dock securement point, and the factory case sucks. I solved the last problem with a custom-made leather case off of eBay that fits the Transformer like a glove.\n\nAsus actively updates their firmware and their engineers have been asking the Facebook fans for advice on things to change for the next generation. And yes, I would certainly buy it again!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I bought this tablet for my mom and she liked the convenience of not having to boot up a slow family computer at home for all her uses. I've now played with her tablet for two weeks and glad I got this tablet for her as it does all it promised.\n\nBuild quality is actually better than I expected as some people have pointed out bleed issues and etc. I find the bleed on my copy very minimal. Barely noticeable on a dim lit screen. Battery life is good. Oh and form-wise, I would like it to be like ipad dimension. It's a bit too long and has too large of a bezel around the screen to make it super sleek.\n\nIn terms of the operating system (honeycomb 3.1), this is my first experience with android. I like how I was able to setup the device with both my mom's and my google account so she was able to see my picasa web albums and my google music library streaming on her device.\nThe native apps works great. She also enjoys reading epub ebooks on the asus library app.\nLove the customizeable widgets. I love how I can easily transfer files with external storage. However, this is where the 4 star comes in. The OS is like what everyone has reviewed, not fully developed. There's not enough app compare to my iphone 4. The quality of the existing apps are not to the standard I'm used to on my phone. The entire OS is a bit laggy from time to time.\n\nOverall, I would think it delivers what I had intented it to do. It lacks important apps offerings such as skype video calls.  But again, at over $100 cheaper than the ipad2, this is definitely more bang of buck."}

This machine can handle it."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Two months and three firmware upgrades later, the Transformer is still one of the best tablets. The new firmware made it more responsive so that it has little to envy from the iPad -except the number of apps.\n\nThe display is beautiful. The text from web pages seemed sharper than that on an iPad 2 -yep, better that the Master of the tablets, on my limited experience with an iPad display unit. That goes for the Samsung 10.1, whose display looks very similar to the iPad. The touch screen is accurate and responsive.\n\nAnd Asus provides standard solutions instead of weird custom software. There is a working microSD card slot -I wish it supported a full size SD card. The device file system is visible on a Windows Vista PC, without additional drivers or the iTunes piece of junk, that my iPhone requires. The HDMI connector is convenient.\n\nThe most significant drawback is the form factor. The wide format screen feels heavier on your hands -perhaps, smaller 7 inch tablets are a better option for hand holding. Still, I'm getting used to it now, even for reading books.\n\nAlso, the custom connector is a little bit of drag.\n\nSince you can move any file into the device, the limited support for media types is frustrating -a problem that the iPad does not have, since iTunes will stop unsupported files. MoboPlayer is very good, but still there are problems due to driver limitations.\n\nSending one firmware upgrade every three weeks is lousy, but I have to concede that the upgrades are important and this stage, and they were implemented without a hitch. Each of them improved the responsiveness of the tabled, specially the web browser.\n\nSpeaking of the browser, the Asus offers the option of rendering web pages like a desktop computer, which works beautifully. The Samsung 10.1 seems to be missing this alternative.\n\nOne glaring gap is the lack of Netflix support. More so because the Asus web site includes Netflix in the list of specifications -the marketing organization from Asus are a pathetic bunch.\n\nOverall, I'm quite pleased with the device. Competitors like the Toshiba Thrive and the Samsung 10.1 make different tradeoffs, but the Asus is a very neat alternative."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Please read the entire review.\n\nAfter only 2 days of use I have had a multitude of problems with the hardware. I am in the Navy and currently deployed overseas so I was excited when my Transformer finally arrived. I opened the box to find a seemingly perfect product. I charged it for 8 hours before use (as suggested in the instructions) and attempted to turn it on for the first time. Nothing. I held the button for 10 seconds, nothing, 20 seconds, nothing, one minute... nothing. After investigating the device further I found that the \"volume up\" button was jammed in and holding the microswitch down, possibly keeping it from powering up. A closer look showed that the very very thin metal bezel that is cut even thinner to accomidate the switch was crushed into the switch, not only jamming it, but loosening up the plastic back cover and misaligning the other 2 buttons on the side. With the aid of an extremely sharp knife I managed to bend the bezel down and relieve pressure on all three switches. I tried again to turn it on, this time successfully.\n\nSetting up the device is simple, like with any other portable device. The touch screen is very responsive but is a magnet for fingerprints and smudges. I applied a Skinomi screen protector within 5 minutes of taking the tablet out of the box which is a fantastic investment, by the way. The initial feel of the device is a bit heavy for its size but it gives a feeling of quality. The textured backing is amazing for grip and there is space between the edge of the tablet and the edge of the screen which is great for thumb placement.\n\nThe software is amazing as usual with any Android build. My Transformer came with Android 3.0 but automatically updated to 3.1 when I connected to the internet. I didn't get too far into the 3.0 build so I couldent see much difference after the update other than some more streamlined menus and a better G-Mail UI.\n\nThe app market is very easy to navigate and is loaded with great apps and some pretty impressive games, some specifically built for the tegra graphics processor. I was able to try my hand at a few games that I purchased for less than $3 a piece. A good value for the quality of gameplay, but thats a whole other review.\n\nDay two of owning the Asus Transformer: I grabbed my tablet and headed out on the town for some well deserved liberty. It proved very useful after we got lost in the city and needed to find our way around. I tucked it away in a protective sleeve and put the sleeve into my backpack for later use. We eventually found ourselves at a hotel with WiFi. I pulled the tablet out to find it was compleatly off which was unusual because I only had it in sleep mode and the battery was above 90% when I last used it. I tried to turn it back on but had no luck. I inspected the volume switch again to find the bezel had been yet again crushed in to the switch. I bent it back and turned the tablet on. At the password screen I attemped to draw my unlock patteren but the screen wouldent respond. I tried to force the tablet off by holding the power button down, which worked but it came right back on with the same problem. I again tried to shut it down and it just came back on. This happened 2 or 3 more times before I gave up and tucked it away in my pack again. I used a friends laptop to search for answers but I couldent find anyone who had the same problem. I woke up this morning and tried to turn it on but nothing. The Asus tech support website is almost useless and the phones don't open until after the weekend. I would just send it back and get a new one but I will be back out to sea by the time that is a possibility.\n\nOverall the tablet was great while it worked. I'm 100% positive I just got a bad unit, thats why I rated it 4/5 stars. The tablet is built well other than the thin metal around the switches. The Android OS is everything I expected and a little more. The processor is fast and the graphics are awesome. The 32 Gb model is the only way to go and it has a microSD card slot so you can expand even more.\n\nI will update this review when I recieve my new tablet."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I won't get into the minor details a lot of other reviews have indulged, as you can find a wealth of information about this product first-hand everywhere on the internet and youtube.\n\nHowever, having used the EEE Transformer for several days now as a complete Android noob and someone who has only used Windows, I thought I would share my expereinces and what you can expect.\n\nThe most important thing about this product is that it IS NOT a netbook nor a suitable replacement for one. I bought a Transformer as a sleek current-generation replacement for the really aged netbook I had. Make no mistake, this is definitively a tablet above all else. Android Honeycomb was designed for dedicated tablet use, and it controls like dedicated tablet. The keyboard, honestly, feels tacked on from a software point of view (hardware wise it is very solid).\n\nA few issues I've had is that the default browser is very basic in functionality compaired to browsers I am used to on PC, and it only supports the most basic of keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+T), which opens new tabs. You can't control how the browser opens tabs either, every single link will open a new tab even if you don't want it to. The tabs never condense and you'll never know how many tabs you have unless you swipe them with your finger. There is also EXTREME typing lag with the browser when using the keyboard, making any kind of input into the browser much more sluggish than it would be on a normal PC.\n\nThere is also the issue that the touchpad doesn't work like a standard touchpad for PC/Mac, in that it simply emulates the touching on the tablet itself. This means accidently bumping into the highly sensative touch pad on the keyboard while you type will cause your cursor and typing to jump between address bar/text field/search bar/etc. So if you plan on typing, you must turn off the touchpad every time.\n\nOn the internet itself, it works great if you plan on just reading or lurking. I LOVE the touchscreen, even when using it as a netbook. It is so much more natural and fluid to scroll by simply sliding your finger than to deal with swiping your finger on the side of a touchpad. Navigation using your finger is a breeze to. If you want added percision, the touchpad on the keyboard provides it in the same way it would for PC/mac. That is one area that Asus really did well with, and works really well with this combo.\n\nUnfortunatly, if you were hoping for full flash support, think again. It is basic at best. Only videos that are specifically optimized for mobile use, such as YouTube, will play properly or smoothly. If you try and watch something from Vimeo, or a basic video player on any website, good luck. It will either not play at all, or play very choppy. What you would think would easily be able to play HD video instead chuggs along in SD as if this were a first generation netbook for any non-youtube video or non-mobile optimized flash content. It is a good thing YouTube has the vast majority of internet video content, but still, it doesn't have the versatility a windows netbook or mac netbook has.\n\nA lot of these issues might be due to the default browser,as far as internet experience goes. However, the problem with all the marketplace browsers, which are vastly better in functionality from what I've seen, have absolutely no keyboard support at all (it only works in textfields), and were all optimized for mobile phones. Dolphin, for example, inexplicably hides all your tabs and address bars when you scroll down the page even outside of fullscreen mode. There is no option to keep them visible at all times, which is pretty much required for comfortable netbook usage. The only effective way to navigate dolphin is to use gestures on the screen... which is entirely useless if you are using this as a netbook.\n\nThis is a problem with the entire marketplace really. A large amount of the apps are all designed for mobile phone use, with only a small selection having proper tablet support, and almost 0% supporting keyboard functionality. Sure you can run the mobile versions on the tablet. Just be prepaired for a giant interface that doesn't work well with the size of a tablet or netbook. For instance, there is currently not a single IM client that is \"Honeycomb Friendly\" on the marketplace except for Dolca. And Dolca is terrible, as it is extremely basic (as of June 2011) and doesn't support any kind of basic features like changing your status.\n\nAnyways, that is all I really want to shed light on. If you are wondering why I am still rating this 4 stars despite being pretty much only a Tablet with very tacked on Netbook support (for an OS not designed for Netbook use at all), the product itself is very very sleek. For a tablet, you can't get much better than this. The keyboard dock is also incredible from a hardware standpoint, and the battery life is massive. Even though it is seriously lacking support from the OS and software, when you want to use it, it is still much better to use than the on-screen keyboard or trying to buy a \"tablet mount\" for your tablet (like what you have to do with the iPad or other tablets).It also works as a great screen protector when you aren't using it.\n\nMake no mistake. This is a great product but be aware if you are buying this, you should probably be more in the market for a Tablet than a Netbook. This is definitively 80% Tablet with 20% netbook, instead of the 50/50 ratio that the ASUS marketing implies."}

The screen is clean and sharp, and easy to read. The finger controls are crisp and very responsive. Yet, its just a tad different from the phone, as you would expect. I've taken to not carrying my previous HP notebook around any more, and I appreciate the weight and size of the Transformer. My only disappointment so far is that the Skype android app does not use the front facing camera yet. Should be available over the next quarter or so.\nPros: Inexpensive, compared to others, Easy to use, great battery life, clean and crisp display, keyboard attachment doubles the battery life (only have to charge once or twice a week), keyboard is intuitively integrated and has all the screen controls on it also, it's casing is sturdy and rigid.\nCons: It's got all the apps you'd ever need, but will take a couple of months to get them integrated, like the Skype app not using the camera yet.\nI just can't say enough good about this machine. Even tho it does not use any wireless network, I find its rare that I cannot find a wifi signal. For those rare occasions, I have my Verizon Droid X."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "After reading so many positive reviews I really wanted to love this tablet. I was hoping for an alternative to the high priced Ipad 2. When the tablet arrived, I was very happy with the quality and the display. After working with it for a few days, trying to configure it and run apps I began to notice some issues. The first thing is the software is very buggy and lots of force closes causing me to lose any information I was working on. There are not too many apps to choose from that are solely for the tablets, however,  most of your phone apps will run on it as well. I'm sure as time goes by the Android Market will increase the number of apps geared specifically towards the tablets, just not quite there yet. Another issue I had involved the back light bleeding into the screen. I saw a review about this but hoped it wouldn't be on my particular unit, sadly, it was. Pretty bad on the darker screens and annoying if you are trying to watch videos. Many videos would not play correctly on it and again, lots of force closes. I tried to love it but I think some of the kinks still need to be worked out. Battery life wasn't great, maybe 6 hours of full use and it was ready for charging. Also, the display is a fingerprint magnet and the keyboard is not the best for typing.  I suspect the 2nd generation Androids will be great once the bugs are worked out. Asus makes a great \"feeling\" tablet just not quite up to speed with Ipad 2. That being said, my return was a breeze. Amazon immediately e mailed me my return authorization along with a printable shipping label. My money was reimbursed within 1 week of the return. Thanks Amazon!! No hassle shopping and easy returns.  My advice would be either wait for the 2nd generation Androids or go with the Ipad 2."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "***Update***\nMy original review below was written about 2 weeks after I got the Transformer. While I do compare it to the iPad, let me be clear that I do feel that this is a superior tablet. I updated to 5 stars form 3 because all of the issues I do have are Android related, not Asus issues. Here are the updates I want to address:\n\n(Please don't get upset that I compare this to an iPad, many people have seen an iPad and not an Android tablet.)\n--I was having battery issues at first, then after some tough conditioning for a week or so the battery life got much better and lasts about as long as an iPad would with similar use. If you don't use GPS and Bluetooth, turn it off.\n--For some reason I did have to do some tweaking to get it to connect via the computer but it works fine now with drag and drop. The driver must have not installed correctly.\n--My volume up button quit altogether, so I will do an RMA. A search on the internet shows this to be somewhat common.\n--Android has improved vastly since my review a couple of months ago. I hardly ever have a crash and the Android Market has been redesigned on tables making it much more useful. I think ICS (Android 4.0) will improve the table even better.\nNegative's: (Really more Android Specific, not Asus issues.)\n--I do still wish there was a spell check to run after an email or on a doc. If you're typing things for a professional environment it really is necessary, but for now I just do the final markup on my computer.\n--There are a lot of phone utilities that come on by default and eat battery life. If you root the Transformer and do some searching you can kill these processes. I would like to see more of a Tablet Android OS to separate the tablets form phones. Hopefully since Google is working on a table we might get this in 2012.\n\nOverall, if you're considering this or an iPad, I would go this way if your are more tech savvy. This device can act more as a computer in many ways. A micro SD slot for file transfer, folder organization, and the keyboard accessory gives you that computer feel. But it also acts very nicely as just a tablet. Games are great and you can customize a lot more than the iPad. Though if you haven't used Android before, it does take a while to get used to it.\n\n***Update End***\n\nI was really looking forward to getting the TF101 (without the dock) when my wife got it for me. I have been using it now for a week and I like it, but had to give it a 3 based on the below. Beware that I have been using my wife's iPad 1 for a year now so that's what I am comparing it to. I used to hate when I saw Android tablets compared to the iPad, but it's necessary to do so for a fair evaluation.\n\nThe TF101:\n\nPros:\n* It seems sturdy and doesn't feel cheap, though you can tell your holding plastic.\n* Micro SD slot built in ( you need the doc for USB and multi card slots)\n* It does seem to run fast and it takes a lot to fill the memory...I haven't done it yet.\nCons:\n* Battery Power: The battery life if horrible! Didn't notice that the 9 hours they advertise is WITHOUT wireless on. Even with a battery saving app that closes running apps I only get about 4-5 full hours use. That's over two days of reading for about an hour at a time and light internet surfing. I have the wireless card turn off when the screen turns off and last night I slept for 6 hours and lost 20% battery power with no apps running and the device just sitting there with the screen off. (to compare, the iPad lost 2% power with WiFi on) My iPad gets about a week, maybe more, on this type of usage without needing charged. Heavy use of the TF101 will require nightly charges. I actually feel I'd be lucky to get a complete movie out of it with a full charge, much less 9 hours of 720p playback!\n* Only micro SD: They need to do a better job of advertising that you only get a micro SD slot and not USB of you only get the tablet. Maybe I over looked it, but I didn't have a micro SD on hand.\n* USB to PC didn't work: It didn't work with my PC. I installed the USB driver and the software form Asus but my PC never saw it to Sync or to drop files in, so I had to get a micro SD card. (I have been in IT for over 10 years so this should have worked, but couldn't get it.)\n* Volume Buttons: Sometimes I have to keep hitting the volume buttons to get them to respond. Also, there is no silent switch which is very useful when you're on a commuter train.\n\nAndroid Software: (This isn't Asus' fault, but it's what's on the device)\nPros:\n* It mostly works well.\n* All apps work in full screen weather designed for tablets or not.\n* Widgets are nice. Many apps you download will come with widgets that you can place on the screens.\n* I like the five screen setup.\nCons:\n* No real spell check: I intend on using this a lot for work, emails and documents. While there is a word completion, it isn't really helpful when you're trying to type fast. You will either have to type slowly or carefully reread your text and find errors yourself. Some people argue that the word completion is enough for spell check, but not if you intend on using it professionally. You need a real spell check to highlight errors in some way.\n* Android market:\no There is no distinction between phone apps and tablet apps. It's annoying to get an app and see that while it functions, it really isn't set up right for the tablet.\no Searching is horrible! If I'm looking for something I usually end up goggling it and typing an app name directly.\no Apps are much more expensive that the Apple app store. Seeing a $.99 app is few and far between.\n* Crashes: I have had several apps crash, something I have seen very little of on iPad or iPhone over that last two years. The default Music app won't even stay open for more than a minute. The file manger also crashed while transferring about 3GB of data.\n* Personal wallpaper: It is nearly impossible to get your own picture to fit correctly on the screen as a wallpaper. It will zoom way in and you'll see a huge portion of your picture. Instead of two smiling kids standing next to each other I got two half heads filling my screen.\n* No way to organize files: I am able to get files on my TF101, but organizing them is not easy. Yes, you can create folders in the File manger, but it isn't an environment to use a lot. I haven't gotten around to looking for a good app for accessing stored files in a nicer way.\n* No app folders: I like organizing my apps into logical groups for quick access. Hopefully to come soon.\n* No connection to iPhone: It won't connect to MyWi (an internet sharing app on my iPhone) No android devices will.\n\nI know there are things I'm forgetting but you get the idea. I only give it 3 stars because it does work and when I am just sitting around using it I do enjoy it. The two biggest negatives for me is the battery life and spell check. The lack of real spell check because I get work done during my commute, and it would be nice to know it will stay on through my commute. I used to hate reading these and see comparisons to the iPad, but you really have to if you've used an iPad. I wanted an Android tablet because Apple refuses to put external storage and HDMI on the iPad and I don't like how they bully the app makers, especially the Ebooks.\n\nGoogle has a long way to go to really be a threat to Apple, but I hope things will continue to get better. I would say if you are going to use your tablet professionally and the \"extras\" like external storage and HDMI are not all that important, go with the Ipad for now."}

The only issue is the lack of a USB port on the tablet itself.  When paired with the dock this has all the expansion you need.  If you want and need a netbook buy one or buy this.

It allows me to work, play and although the start up is a bit slower than I would have expected, overall I am pleased.  Things I have noticed:\n\nBleed on the screen when I touch the settings bar\nMetal frame pulling away at the top of the tablet\n\nI am able to find apps for most everything I need (except Netflix - which I have on my Droid Incredible) and overall I think it will be a great tablet once the kinks are worked out.\n\nSo far unimpressed with the ASUS customer service."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I bought the Transformer a few weeks ago for $400, these are my thoughts ...\n\nThe device feels solid and the weight is evenly distributed.  I've been holding it three ways: like a game controller in landscape mode, pinching the bottom like the spine of a book, and cradling the device in portrait mode with one hand while scrolling with the other (reading).  The shape, including bezel size, is well designed.  The power and volume buttons are tactile and responsive.\n\nWhen I'm not holding it, I prop it up on my desk and use it as a kind of 'control-panel' allowing me to keep track of the live-updating widgets on my homescreens (Twitter/Facebook/Email/News/Calendar/Music).  A benefit of tablets is a small device footprint; the Transformer fits nicely on my desk.  The comically short power cord isn't an issue for me because I charge at the desk, and battery life is excellent.\n\nHoneycomb 3.1 is delightful, and makes me happy I chose to develop Android apps [disclosure]. There are great apps (Apparatus, News360, PewPew, DrawerPro, GTasks, Google Maps) and Widgets.  However, it is apparent that most developers have yet to optimize their apps for Honeycomb.  The touch screen feels most responsive to swipe actions, tapping actions don't register as well compared to smart-phones, this is most obvious while typing on the soft-keyboard or drawing in a sketchpad app, but its something I've grow accustomed to.\n\nMy internet browsing experience on tablet vs. laptop is quite different due to an aversion I have to typing on a touch-screen.  The ergonomics are definitely worse on the larger screen.  I avoid the keyboard by bookmarking websites and accessing them via the Bookmarks widget, or via twitter/facebook/reader/news feeds.  Despite the poor typing, I enjoy internet browsing on the tablet more than my computer.  I can browse comfortably on the couch, and the tablet is conducive to 'surfing' the internet rather than 'searching' the internet, a reminder of why I love the internet.  The killer browsing feature, which I use constantly, is double-tap to zoom in/out of text columns.\n\nMedia management happens through a combination of the traditional 'drag and drop [media files]' into the ASUS file system, and google cloud services (if you have them).  I discovered the 'cloud' part when I transferred movies to the harddrive, opened the gallery, and found all of my Picasa photo albums (amazing!).  I'm guessing Google Music will operate the same way.  The gallery and music applications organize media into single-level hierarchies which spares the user of having to navigate the file system.  I have two complaints about ASUS integration with Mac OSX: 1. I was forced to install 'Android File Transfer' (think usb driver) to access the Transformer harddrive. Also, there are no clear instructions for installing the 'ASUS Sync' onto Mac OSX, so I don't know if its possible, or if this precludes access to 'SkyDrive'.\n\nMedia consumption is adequate.  At max sound volume, movie dialog is washed out by vehicles passing an open window.  On the other hand, the tablet encourages a sense of intimacy that improves the viewing experience.  For music, the speakers are a bit tinny, and I prefer the sound quality from my HTC Evo to the transformer (the evo speaker has a kind of classic handheld radio sound that appeals to me).  Watching videos on YouTube is worse than watching on my Macbook using the same internet connection, this could mean that the wireless receiver is less powerful, or that the YouTube app doesn't cache data correctly. This tablet is perfect for viewing Photos because of the fantastic screen and Gallery setup.  I will definitely consider uploading my photos to Picasa instead of Facebook (be the change I want to see in the world).\n\nThe astounding part is that this device aggregates all information I normally gather by navigating to websites or apps onto a single screen of widgets: both of my email accounts side-by-side, my upcoming appointments, my task list, weather, twitter, and news.  The OS is responsive and pretty, the games are fun, the browser works great for all websites, media management is simple, Google Maps is perfect for this screen.  The size and weight are correct.  For $400 dollars, and without forcing me to purchase more accessories, the Transformer gets 5 stars.  Nice tablet."}

We use Google products at our office so the Transformer syncs up MUCH better than the Ipad.  Screen quality is VERY close to the ipad as well, which is what I felt the other tablets fell short of.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Some people use/review several tablets. This isn't that kind of review. I'm not \"into\" electronics much. I have my HTC android phone and my laptop and that seemed sufficient for me. After seeing a 5 stars out of 5 review of the ASUS EEE tablet on G4's \"ATTACK OF THE SHOW\", my daughter and I decided to get one for my husband for Father's Day. This turned out to be an awesome gift. We are still finding things the tablet can do. My daughter has an I-pad she bought for herself, but I prefer the Android. I think it's still better than the IPad. This morning I took a picture with the camera and was sending it via email. I was thinking that I may invest in the keyboard, but found that you can swipe and spell- no need for the keyboard.(You can swipe your finger across the screen to each letter and it autofills the words so quickly. I think it was about 90% accurate)\nCompared to my phone, this thing is extremely easy to personalize. You can easily add wallpaper and take off any icons/apps. The android market has a plethora of free apps.\nI love to cook and I look forward to having the ASUS in the kitchen with me. I pull up my favorite site, ALLRECIPES.com (I bought the $2.99 pro version to have all of my stored recipes on the tablet) and I don't have to print off every recipe I want to try- I just look on the ASUS.\nI'm not a techie in the least, but after seeing what my husband's can do, I bought one for myself and am loving it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Based on what I saw at CES, 2011 will be 'year of the tablet'. I was unimpressed with the Xoom for ergonomic and price reasons. Then the Asus came out and for the MSRP of $399 it's amazing. Same specs and OS as the Motorola for $200 less. 16GB + expandable by another 32GB with a memory card, and the display (1280x800) allows for pixel-by-pixel HD content. Which, by the way, if transcoded with Handbrake, looks awesome with minimal 'hiccups'. There are still bugs in Honeycomb which is disappointing, but the browser works well and I love having real tabs across the screen like on a desktop. If you have an Android phone, your apps can be installed on the tablet as well (with few exceptions).  It also allows for an optional keyboard dock which I will also be writing a review about. The bezel does seem cheaply made, as it creaks in a few places.\n\nEDIT 6/26/2011: I went online and found that Flash is not getting 30fps, and HD video is under 10fps. On the Xoom and Galaxy Tab 10.1, framerates are much better. This is disappointing and caused me to lower my item rating.\n\nEDIT 1/1/2012: I noticed that I never mentioned when they fixed the Flash framerate problem, but it was in the fall and now streaming is acceptable. I like using the HDMI out to watch Amazon Instant Video without buying a Roku. But I want to mention that the fit and finish isn't as great as a Samsung or Apple, as the bezel creaks some."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "This is actually the first review I have ever written on Amazon but I felt it necessary to write a review for this amazing tablet.  I have owned the Samsung Galaxy Tab (7\") but have also spent a fair amount of time with the iPad, iPad 2 and Xoom (I have also owned a Droid, DroidX, Fascinate and iTouch).  This tablet completely blows all of them out of the water!  After installing the 3.1 update (which downloaded automatically upon powering up the machine) it is blazing fast.  I have not experienced any lag in the OS or any of the programs.  I have already found a few tablet-specific apps that look like fun and literally have not stopped playing with it in the 2 hours I have owned it.  I heard numerous stories about light bleed or just a cheap overall build but this couldn't be farther from the truth (at least in my case).  The tablet feels very solid and the screen is gorgeous!  I also purchased the keyboard and it has been a blast to use as well.  The keyboard actually makes it feel like a true laptop experience.  It's very intuitive and in the short time I have owned it I have already figured out many of the tricks.  I can't comment on battery yet but based on the previous reviews I expect it to be more than sufficient for my needs.  I recently owned a Toshiba netbook tablet and even with the keyboard the Asus is slimmer and lighter than the netbook was.  Considering it will also get 2-3x the battery life I couldn't be happier.  For anyone on the fence this is definitely the tablet to own.  Sure the new Samsung 10.1\" might be a tad slimmer/lighter but the added microsd slot and full USB ports on the keyboard push the Asus well over the top for me.  I purchased a 32GB microsd off of Amazon for $50 so for $450 all in I have a 48GB machine.  Pretty awesome!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Pros: Android honeycomb - its updated to 3.1 automatically over the air - its smooth and looks great, and the settings manager is really easy to use and full-featured\n- Great display - 10.1\" of IPS goodness\n- Surprisingly large collection of apps, from what I had read online, it sounded like there are only a few apps for a tablet. While there may not be 50K apps, I've found most of the apps I was looking for.\n- Fantastic browser, much better than what I have on my iPad.\n- The app store now tells you which apps and games are compatible with your android device.\n- The tablet is well-made, does not feel plasticky, there's a corner on my tablet that flexes more than it should but its minor.\n\nCons: The bezel is a little larger than it should be, feels like its bigger than it should be.\n- The android marketplace is okay, its a bit confusing to use until you get used to it.\n- Not as many games specifically for the tablet\n- Poor speakers and mic, there is no other way to put this, you cant use this tablet for voice-chats. I had to hold it upside down and speak into the mic to be heard clearly. Without 3G, this was never going to be my main device for video-chatting anyway, but its disappointing all the same.\n\nThis is great tablet, its well made. Yes its not an iPad, but the build quality is nearly as good. Android 3.1 is fantastic, its a huge improvement over iOS in terms of usability. A tablet that can actually run multiple apps at the same time, where you don't have to close an app to open a new one - sounds great. Also I really hate the iPads app-button based interface, so this is a breath of fresh air. My only real complaint is the poor-quality speakers on the thing. I'm not sure how much I need the speakers, since most of my listening is done over headphones, but it would have been nice to have better speakers. Its a good tablet, inspite of its low price, would highly recommend getting one."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I have been eager to acquire the first tablet for my household - I have many different applications for tablets in mind to fit my family's digital lifestyle, at the top of which is long car rides where I don't want to waste precious car space with DVD cases, multiple devices (game consoles, portable players, laptops).  So with an eager mind and a lot of research, I took the plunge on the Transformer expecting to experience the same thrill as I had when I first bought my EVO 4G at launch last year.\n\nWhat I found in practice is the tablet experience on Android is not yet compelling enough to look past some of the flaws of the Transformer.  My unit suffered from pretty strong light bleeding, to the point where the lower half of the screen had a permanently yellowish tint to it.  Also, the touchscreen was not entirely responsive to touch, particularly when using any browser, stock or otherwise.\n\nThe unit itself was heavily borrowed from the Google reference architecture, so I don't really have any negatives to speak of regarding style - Asus did a good job with the look and feel of the Transformer.  It's an attractive device and it's easy to hold and the weight isn't a problem as I found it to be on the Acer Iconia.\n\nLike others have also pointed out, they aren't kidding about how short the charging cable is.  I don't know what Asus was thinking shipping the Transformer with a charge cable that's no more than 2' long.  I don't know how many times I yanked the charger out of the wall reaching for the tablet while it was sitting next to the bed.\n\nThe devil for me is in the details - the lack of apps, the lack of mature and broad support for video codecs, and the knowledge that ICS and quad core devices are just around the corner will keep me from rushing to replace my Transformer, but I look forward to the future and getting back in.\n\nJust a hunch, but I'd wager many of the positive reviews came from folks who bought the $399 16 GB version.  At that price point, some of the hardware and OS [maturity] issues become more forgivable, but at $499 for the 32 GB version you start to have other options which become more attractive - especially now that the Galaxy Tab 10.1 launched (yes, it's 16 GB, but there are other benefits) and the Toshiba tablet launched as well."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I recently purchased this device about two weeks ago, and brought it with me on vacation.\n\nIt was amazing to take on the plane and playing games/watching videos/reading comics on it made the flight pass by so quickly!  It's great for kids (assuming you warn them to be very careful with it), and my younger cousin loved playing Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja on the Transformer.\n\nI have read many complaints of build quality issues and flash problems in the browser.  I have upgraded to Honeycomb 3.1 and have to say that flash in the stock browser works pretty damn well.  And I'm sure it will work even better when Adobe updates it to fully optimize flash for tablets.  The back panel feels great in my hands, and the screen is gorgeous.  As for build quality issues, I have felt small amounts of creaking on the left edge of the tablet when I apply a little pressure, but this seems to be a non issue (unless you're one of those people who just absolutely can't stand anything wrong with their electronics) because it doesn't make the overall experience any less enjoyable in my eyes.  As for the backlight bleed, it is indeed there.  But, I only noticed it when I turned off all of the lights in my room and set brightness to high - hardly standard conditions.  This however seems to vary from device to device (some have more prevalent bleeding than others), so be cautious.  Webcam works fine, for what it is (1.2 mp ffc and 5 mp back).  I've only tried it with Google Talk, and it's really handy to switch to back camera to show the person you're webcamming something else.  However, Google Talk doesn't allow text chat at the same time as webcamming, and stops the webcam when you go to type in chat.  This will probably be updated in the future, if not by Google, then Skype or Oovoo will most likely release something better.\n\nAs for the speakers - people have had balance issues, i.e one side is louder than the other.  However, this is not the case for my Transformer.  The speakers are, however, not anything to be buying this tablet for.  That being said, with the Voodoo sound driver implements coming soon for the Transformer (those with SGS phones know what I'm talking about!), I'm sure the speakers will sound great!  You can even fix the speaker balance issues, though it requires root - all of this is on the XDA forums for the Transformer.\n\nThe only real problem I have with the Transformer is the video playback for certain formats.  Testing out Moboplayer, Rockplayer, and Vplayer, they all run most videos I throw at the tablet quite well.  However, when you get to 720p formats (flv and x264 in particular for me), the software decoding is not enough and the playback is pretty choppy.  Vplayer runs them the best in my experience but definitely still choppy.  Surely enough though, there is a fix for this too - convert the videos to a format that works.  There is plenty of information about this on XDA as well.  For those that believe this is a painstaking procedure to go through - then just wait for Google to update Honeycomb further for better 720p playback support.\n\nDespite its flaws in video playback, and other issues related to software, I can't get enough of this device.  I love reading comics on it, and the IPS screen is a beauty to look at!  The colors are so vibrant.  And with new optimized games and apps constantly making their way to Honeycomb, it's safe to say that this device is a safe buy for the future."}

When I played with a Xoom at the local Best Buy, Honeycomb at first felt unnecessarily complicated. After taking literally a couple of minutes to google how a couple of features work, it has become an absolute joy to use. It looks quite sleek and far less bulky than the Acer W500. I went to check out a Galaxy 10.1 at the store and honestly the apparent difference in size was hardly enough to sway me.\n\nI was able to load all kinds of stuff onto a 16GB card and plug it into a tablet. Movies of various formats play beautifully, documents are snappy to use. It just works so well. Glad I stuck with the Asus - the 16Gb card is already used up and I can swap it out at will.\n\nThere is light bleed when viewing a totally black screen but you forget about it as soon as you start using the tablet. The speakers are way too quiet. The last gripe is that the hdmi does not work with my tv which apparently is an issue with all Panasonic Plasmas. These are hardly deal breakers for me.

This tablet is just great for functionality. It is not a replacement for a computer, bu does everything I want perfectly. Also, finally! They built a tablet with the speakers on the front, instead of one puny stupid speaker on the back like the iPad has. One gripe I have is the lack of accessories.

Sorry Steve..somebody finally gona nail you down.....Not to mention, awesome amazon customer service which is phenomenal in regards to any issue one might have or arise."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "After having an Android phone I purchased this tablet based on reviews and price. It's a great product, as soon as I logged in to my Google account, it downloaded all my apps I had on my phone. Then it did a Asus software update. The microSD slot works great - took the memory card out of my camera and plugged it - the tablet picked it right up and I could view all my pictures.\n\nFor those looking for a case, I took mine to a local store and tried several out. The HP mini case for a 10.2 netbook fit nice. It even has a pocket on the outside for items. The Just Air IPAD CASE item 8271 fit snug as well. This is the only ipad case that would fit this unit. Both of these are a lot cheaper than the so called ASUS cases listed on Amazon."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "This is the best Android tablet out there, especially if you factor in the price.\n\nPro:  $400, Amazing display, great hardware, dock able, decent battery life, Honeycomb OS (which is great) and microSD (not on Galaxy Tab).  After being rooted with the PRIME 1.4 ROM and NOT overclocked, the Transformer scores 2500 on Quandrant, other Tegra 2 stock devices on Honeycomb 3.1 are getting 1500-1800.\n\nCon:  Only when comparing this to the IPAD because of its extensive application support, is there a con to this tablet over other tablets.  I use this tablet for casual use.  I use a laptop for school and professional reasons, it is much more capable.\n\nI highly recommend this product."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "This is actually my first review.  I really wanted to get my hands on this tablet.  Right when I took it out the box, the first thing i noticed is that the backing is really flimsy.  It feels really soft and could crack easily.  A day later it fell of my bed which is actually low to the ground and landed on carpet.  Immediately the back came lose with the screen as well.  The power button also got jammed.\n\nI gave this two stars because the tablet is good and it does have a dock that is sold seperately.  It doesnt have any usb ports on the actual tablet, only with the dock.\n\nInitially I found it good, with the touchscreen and the UI it comes with.\nAfter using the acer iconia A500, there is a big difference.  The A500 is a lot smoother when switching apps with multi-tasking. Plus the Usb is a great add on, it powers up my portable external hard drive quite well. And easy to navigate to using mobo app."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Overall, I'm quite satisfied with my ASUS Transformer.  The size and weight, speed & system resources, price, screen, design - all great.  But like other reviewers I have serious doubts in ASUS' quality control.  I'm on my third Transformer (and this seems to be a keeper), the first one had HORRIBLE backlight bleed around 3 of the edges.  The second one had reasonably bad backlight bleed on the \"bottom\" edge of the screen, the power button was half broken and would get stuck in the body and the screen had apparently not been properly fit in the body as there was a very small gap between it and the bezel and a piece of plastic protruding out.  The third feels more solid, and so far I haven't noticed any issues with it.\n\nThey've got the makings of a great product, but with the serious quality issues coupled with the inability to meet demand, I fear they may falter."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Received mine yesterday and I love the concept.  It runs well and is snappy but the backlight light bleed and initial error messages related to DMCLIENT were troublesome.  DMCLIENT error was corrected by updating the firmware and wiping/reestablishing the user information.  Light bleed can't be fixed.  Also, there was a short but fairly deep scratch on the glass above the camera.  It is the backlight and scratch issues that cause me to seek a replacement.\n\nI am hopeful that those are not problems on the replacement. Sans those issues, this is a great device.  Once updating the firmware (which also updates Android to 3.1) and installing Flash 10.3, this is a true multimedia device (hopefully native Netflix, Hulu, etc. support will be added in future updates).  I like the included Asus Cloud and desktop replication software and I've had no issues with any apps I've installed from the Market.  There may be benefits to rooting this device but I haven't yet seen the need.\n\nI've used a G Tablet for the past month or so and while this device is certainly more expensive, it feels more substantial, has more RAM, tremendous display and greater resolution, GPS, Android 3.1 and so far no apps needing to be force closed.\n\nAsus motherboards have always served me well and I had an Asus laptop years ago that was superior.  I am hopeful that the quality issues associated with this product are specific to a particular batch and addressed in the replacement I hope to receive shortly.\n\nI love the product but the Quality Assurance issues cost it a star.\n\n6/21 Update...\nReplacement has been received and there are none of the issues that beset the first one.  No software errors, screen was pristine and no light bleed.  I really love this device for the reasons stated earlier as well as the growing number of applications that become available each day.  Thanks also to Amazon for getting the replacement out toot sweet."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "First off, the Transformer is a very good tablet. The build quality and construction is excellent, and it's easy to hold, use and look at. I would call it just about perfect at this price point, and the only extremely minor niggles are somewhat cheap feeling power/volume buttons. The screen is excellent, and on par or better than the iPad. Battery life seemed fine, and I went 2-3 days between charges, spending an hour or two reading eBooks and some additional time web browsing or looking at emails. The only oddity to the battery life was a couple of times where I left the tablet for a couple of days, fully charged, and when I went to use it again, the battery was completely dead. This did not happen if I used the tab, even briefly each day.\n\nThe Google honeycomb operating system (after the 3.1 upgrade) is quite stable, and I never encountered any crashes or reboots. The only recurring problem I had with the OS was it took about 30 minutes to get it to connect to my 802.1X wifi network, and it occasionally disconnects from WiFi, and will only reconnect when you disable and reenable the WiFi radio.\n\nThe Kindle app and web browsing are excellent, and the notification system is far superior to Apple's.\n\nSo, why am I returning the tab? The short answer is applications, mainly Skype and Netflix support. This tablet is 90% of the way there hardware-wise, and 75% software-wise. My family uses Skype extensively, and while the app exists on Honeycomb, there is no video calling support. The mic on the tab is also less than stellar, resulting in fairly poor audio quality. Other key apps I use around personal productivity (task managers, mind mapping tools, etc.) simply don't yet exist for google's tabs, and Netflix is also not available.\n\nI really wanted to like this tablet, and several elements were vastly superior to Apple's offering, but the lack of application support and other \"rough edges\" have it going back. If you primarily want a tab to browse the web, email, read eBooks, and play the occasional game, this is a hands-down winner, with great hardware/software at a very compelling price. However if video calling is important, and you need some niche apps, you may find the device wanting as I did."}

I just received mine today but I'm afraid I got a bad one. The right side is loose, makes loud creaking noises when I hold it, and seems like it's gonna fall apart on me.\n\nI really hope ASUS improves their quality control because it seems a lot of these tablets either have this same problem or issues with light bleed, which mine has a bit too.\n\nI'm thinking of getting the Galaxytab 10.1, but the lack of expansion really kills it for me.  I guess I'm just gonna get another Transformer and just cross my fingers I get a good one this time.\n\nIf I'd gotten a good one, I would have given it 5 stars.\n\nUpdate: Thanks to Amazon for their easy return policy.  I upgraded the review to two stars because as I was shipping the item back I realized that the box had a small dent on the side where the pad was falling apart.  So there's a big possibility that the damage was caused by a fall, and not a manufacturing defect.  Either way, the tablet just didn't feel solid enough and the edges around the bezel were too sharp for my liking.  I'm undecided on what I'll get next, I'm having a hard time deciding on the Toshiba Thrive, Samsung Galaxytab 10.1, Ipad2, or the Xoom--after the $100.00 price drop."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I purchased the Asus Transformer partly because I have owned 4 Asus laptops in succession.  All 4 are still working and I still happily use 2 daily.  So to cut to the chase; like other reviewers, the screen on my unit stopped responding about 1 hour into it's use.  The battery hadn't even finished charging.  I had managed to sync my Google account and played with the clever water wallpaper and that's about it.  Amazon accepted the return quickly and graciously like the 5 star company they are.  I feel sorry for them after reading how many people have received defective Transformers in the brief time that it's been on sale here.\n\nIn the short time I had the tablet on, I was impressed with the crispness and color rendition of the screen and the weight/balance of the tablet in general.  I was less with the grip.  Yes the back is textured, but it still had a slightly slippery feel to it.  My Samsung Galaxy Tab is easier to hold with no texture on the back.  With the poor quality control and and price, I have decided to look to Toshiba or Samsung for my next Android tablet instead of Asus.  I hope Asus reads these reviews and make sure it isn't repeated on any more of their computers."}

Samsung 10.1 at $100 more should beat it in terms of overall physical feel since the Samsung is lighter, thinner, and has a thinner bezel. However, you need to buy their dongle to get hdmi and microsd expansion if they offer them at all.\n\nPros\n-----------\n1) Price\n2) Build quality exceeds the price. I hear people complaining about flex but the who in their right mind bend their tablets/laptops? It's very solid.\n3) Great design. The color and material used is very good even if the back is plastic.\n4) Screen is fantastic.\n5) Rooting the machine is straightforward with xda guide. Google \"xda transformer developer\" for the guide.\n6) You have 100% root compatible machine for all future firmwares. The boot key has been discovered.\n7) GMail app is worlds better than anything I have used including iPad.\n8) Very smooth performance. Only thing slower than iPad is pinch-zoom fluidity. Still very laggy on 3.1 android.\n\nCons:\n------------\n1) Slight light leakage in my lower right corner screen. It appears this is a common problem but the leakage is a very minor issue and barely noticeable only during night time.\n2) Speaker volume not high enough. It has very little mid-range and the max volume is just not loud enough.\n3) A few mm too wide. If you try to hold it with two hands in the default position the extra width bezel doesn't feel too great.\n4) Unstable system apps. Youtube app crashes on certain HD videos. In fact, it's more stable to use the browser version of youtube. Browser likes to crash.\n5) Auto-brightness is set too low. They need a sensitivity toggle.\n6) Not enough HD/tablet resolution apps.\n\n*** Updated 6/19/2011 ***\n\n1) So far the only defect I have seen in this device is the light leakage. Turns out there is also a more substantial leak from the top left corner. Not enough to warrant a return but a negative none-the-less.\n2) Battery life is extremely good even when overclocked to 1.6ghz with clemsyn-blade kernel at xda.\n3) Charging speed is ridiculous. You seriously will not believe how fast this thing charges.\n4) More HD/Tablet friendly apps are appearing by the hour and I would say 70% of the major apps you have on the android phone is now tablet ready.\n\n*** Updated 7/6/2011 ***\n\n1) A negative note. There is now some dust marks below the lens cover for the back camera. Unfortunately it would be impossible for me to clean it without taking apart the machine. This defect is caused by some spacing between the back cover plate and the main unit."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I'm going to guess that because of its enormous popularity, Asus is trying to churn out as many of these as they can, and so the manufacturing quality is suffering. In my case, I got one that wouldn't boot. After talking with tech support they said I could RMA it or return it to Amazon. Unfortunately, even though I clearly just received the product that day and it was new, they don't pay for shipping (unlike Amazon, which at least pays for return shipping on defective products). So back it goes. To Amazon. And between this and a friend of mine also having trouble with his Asus laptop, these two points of data are going to be enough for me to shy away from Asus for quite some time, if not forever.\n\nTo their credit, after navigating through their voice menu, an English speaking human picked up immediately.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I've only really taken the time to write a handful of reviews on Amazon, yet I always seem to check them before making a purchase. So hopefully this will help for anyone that does the same . . .\n\nI was debating picking up this tablet or the new Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1. The thinner profile really lured me towards the SGT, but after reading some pretty good reviews about the Transformer I decided I'd take a look at it. What eventually swayed me towards the Transformer were Price (over $100 cheaper than the 16gb SGT), the microSD and the miniHDMI built onto the device (both lacking on the SGT). Seeing as I was going to mostly use this on the couch to check mail, RSS feeds, games (not read, I have a kindle for that), the slightly extra weight didn't bother me.\n\nI received my Transformer yesterday and I have to say, I am very happy with the purchase. Let's see if I can break down the pros and few cons:\n\nSize/Build: I compared it against my girlfriend's iPad1: weight is about the same, if not a smidgen lighter than the iPad. It's a bit wider, due to the widescreen aspect of the Transformer. They are about the same thickness. I've read that the textured back of the tablet is a love/hate thing, but I actually liked having something with texture to hold. The cameras are hit or miss, but I don't really plan to use them that much, who wants to take photos with a tablet?\n\nHoneycomb: I have to say, I am IN LOVE with Honeycomb. I was prompted to download the 3.1 update once I had it setup. This tablet is so smooth and quick. Transitions from each \"panel\" are smooth. Apps load instantly. Browsing my RSS feed on the google reader app was noticeably quicker on the tablet compared to my phone (HTC Thunderbolt). One other pleasant surprise was after I had finished setting up my google account and going through the setup, I had noticed it auto-downloaded all the apps I had downloaded for my phone. Was also able to download my Amazon App Store purchases as well (yay for plants vs. zombies on a tablet). I really wish I could have Honeycomb on my phone, such a beautiful and well laid out UI from Google. Has me excited to see what Ice Cream Sandwich has in store with the merging of the tablet/phone OS.\n\nCons: Or should I say, con? The only thing about this tablet that didn't impress me would have to be the speakers. Now, it's not a deal breaker by any means, but when I fired up some music via Google Music, the quality could have been a bit better. I didn't try with headphones, so I can't say how that stacked up. Music from games seemed ok.\n\nAll in all, I'm highly impressed with what Asus has offered. I was able to pick up the 16gb for $398 (when amazon offered it, not 3rd parties). For that price, it can't be beat. Picked up a 32gb microSD for extra storage.\n\nI'll try to come back here after I have more time to play with it."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I just sent my second device back because of unacceptable build quality.  I can't comment on the functionality of the device because I sent both back without getting to play with them much.\n\nThe first one had a really annoying creak/click at two places on the body.  I was debating whether to keep it and just try to ignore the creak when I also discovered a grey pixel near the middle of the screen, which was noticeable on a white screen.  I sent that one back and waited for my replacement.  The second one I received was creak free.  However, there was noticeable light bleed along the bottom and on the edge, and I found a dust particle stuck under the glass, which was noticeable on a bright white screen.  So, I sent that one back too.\n\nI assume that many people would just ignore these build flaws.  However, I am the type that really notices and is bothered by such imperfections, and I feel that if I am paying $400 for something that is far from a necessity, it should not be flawed.  There seems to be too much variability in the build quality of these systems.  Some claim they have a perfect tablet.  However, I suspect if they really looked, they would find something wrong.  If you are curious, turn your brightness up all the way, go in a dark room, and look at an all-black screen and an all-white screen.  I just looked up black screen or white screen on Google and expanded the image.  Look for light bleed, which looks as if light is leaking into the black screen from the edges.  Also, with the white screen, look for any irregular pixels or dust particles that cannot be removed by wiping the screen.\n\nOnce the Transformers are available at B&M stores, I may give one more attempt and see if I can find a \"perfect\" system.  Otherwise, I may consider the Thrive when it comes out."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Amazon did its part in this transaction, fast and accurate service. When I received the tablet I was very happy. I wanted to expand the memory so as soon as I had a chance, I bought a 32gig micro sd. I pushed the card into the slot and it just slid in all the way with no spring action. There was no way to get it out. It was stuck all the way in and wasn't being read by the tablet. I tried getting it out with my finger nails but no way. I had to use a razor blade to get it out,being extremely carefull not scratch or damage the tablet in any way. I did it, luckily with no damage. So beware when inserting the micro sd cards if there is no springy type of feel, stop before it gets stuck. Amazon is taking it back without a problem, as usual, but they didn't have a replacement so I'm waiting till it becomes available again. In my opinion, still the best Android tablet on the market."}

I had read all the hype and was looking forward to receiving mine. However, I also read many of the problems and complaints some people were having with their Transformers and was also somewhat apprehensive. Well, I finally got my TF from Best Buy ($399) a couple of weeks ago. I waited until now to post my review. As you can see from my rating, I am extremely happy with the Transformer. I use it everyday and have not been on my desktop or laptop since I got it.\n\nOverall, the quality of materials and the fit/finish of the device is top notch. The brown textured surface on the backside of the tablet looks very classy and coordinates very nicely with the bronze-like metallic finish of the bezel surrounding the screen. The textured surface also provides a decent grip to hold the tablet in your hand. I would have preferred smoother edges along the sides, but it's definitely not too bad. Connectivity to wifi was simple and has been very stable. I have not had any issues with loss of connectivity at any time. The GPS receiver seems to work very well - much better than on my Samsung Captivate phone, which frequently loses connection. The IPS screen is very bright with vivid colors and deep blacks. The fact that the screen is gorilla glass keeps it looking like new especially after a quick wipe down of any fingerprints. The touchscreen is very responsive and accurate. Although the Transformer has a large 10.1\" screen, the tablet doesn't feel heavy in your hand like other tablets with similar form factors - it weighs just 1.4 lbs. The sound on the TF is adequate for most situations. However, I would definitely recommend using quality headphones to listen to music. The processor does an adequate job for most apps. Some Tegra-optimized games like Pinball HD look amazing.\n\nMy only complaint is apps crashing once in awhile (requiring a force close). This of course, is an issue related to the Android OS or the app itself and not necessarily fault of the tablet. It happens on my Android phone as well.\n\nOverall, I am absolutely satisfied with the Asus Transformer and have already recommended it to many friends."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "As an original iPad owner, I was interested in an Android tablet since I was going to give my girlfriend the iPad.  The three most important factors for me were cost, display quality, and capability.  The Transformer came out ahead in all three categories for me vs the Galaxy Tab, Xoom, and Acer Iconia.\n\nCost - At $399 for the 16gb version, it was definitely the least expensive of all the tablets.  This is important for me because although I'm not an super early technology adapter, I usually am on board within a few months.  With news of quad-core processors coming in the next year or so, I didn't want to make a huge investment on a tablet.  The $399 price point is perfect, judging by the speedy sales of this tablet.\n\nDisplay quality -  The original iPad had a great IPS display.  My only problem with it was the 4:3 orientation.  When I watched movies on it, part of the screen gets cutoff.  Comparing it side by side with my original iPad, the Transformer looks just as nice but with the 16:9 orientation.\n\nCapability -  Most (if not all) Android tablets have the same Tegra 2 dual-core processor and 1024 mb of ram.  Front and rear cameras are also pretty standard.  Where they differ is USB port, HDMI port, micro SD slot, etc.  For me personally, my must haves were micro SD slot and HDMI.  I did like the fact the Iconia had a USB slot.  However, it didn't have the IPS display and the Transformer has a dock that would also have USB slots, keyboard, and battery.  Although I probably won't be getting the dock anytime soon, it's nice to know I have the option.  Not having a micro SD slot or HDMI on the Galaxy Tab was what knocked it off my list.  If it had both of those, I'd be willing play a little more since it is the thinnest and lightest tablet.\n\nOverall, the Transformer is the best bang for your buck.  At $399, you have a tablet that competes with any on the market in terms of performance and beats any tablet in terms of capability.  It should also be noted that Asus is a quality brand, legendary in the PC hardware market.  They also got the 3.1 Honeycomb update out extremely fast, within a week or two of when it came out.  That bodes well for future updates."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I purchased the Eee Pad as a replacement for an aging laptop.  So far with the it has performed as expected, with no problems or fatal flaws.\n\nPros:  Dual core-processor Nvidia processor. Honeycomb Android OS. Separate keyboard WITH BATTERY that extends life up to 16 hours (I haven't tested the claimed 16 hours of video. but it hasn't died on me with the keyboard after 1 day of heavy use), more reasonable price at $499 compared to the 32gb models  Motorola ($586) and Apple ($680) tablets based on hardware alone.  Easy Multitasking between multiple apps running at the same time.  Internet browsing is smooth even with multiple tabs and Flash video/advertising.  Other features that are nice include the micro SD slot to add memory and HDMI output.  The Honeycomb OS is pretty clean with very little bloatware.\n\nCons:  No USB on the tablet itself, the Acer Iconia has the feature built into the tablet, heavy (but this may be the cost of the great battery life).  Small selection of apps that take advantage of the hardware and OS so far, Netflix works on my old Droid phone, but not on the Eee Pad.  The OS will get bogged down with excessive Apps running at once, but it really isn't an issue.\n\nOther:  Fortunately, I have not experienced any of the hardware issues that a lot of others have (see other reviews).  I do own the keyboard and highly recommend it if you plan to type up longer texts or use USB devices.  If you do not plan on buying the keyboard with the Asus Eee Pad, the Acer Iconia tablet is very similar and has USB ports in the tablet.  If you plan on doing a lot of gaming, the iPad 2 may be more appropriate based on selection of games and the new Apple processor."}

I read up on them all and the ASUS had me ready (also looked heavily into the ACER A500 and Viewsonic Gtablet).  Got the item (purchased 26 May, received 3 June) and loaded it up.  It worked great.  I could even work off of a remote desktop to run apps from my desktop (NETFLIX not working yet, so watched movies of splashtop remote - not great pic quality, but it worked).\n\nHad for a week and came home today to a machine that would not respond to touch.  Turned off/on/plugged/unplugged - no luck.  Eventually wiped to factory settings - no luck!  Now I am out of a tablet and must send back for a refund (military stationed overseas, so have to mail back).  Definitely disappointed!  Definitely disappointed, I really wanted to like it.  May have to look into the ACER or Viewsonic, or heaven's forbid by an IPAD2.\n\nBTW Google ASUS transformer not responding to touch - I am not the only one having this problem - only write reviews when I really feel strongly about something (you can guess what way I am leaning).\n\nUPDATE: 26 Aug 11.\nBought a replacement, which came two weeks later (replacement from another dealer as all Amazon stores were out) and it has worked flawlessly since ( now on android 3.2).

I even tried some other tablets in a local store, but wanted to get the Asus Transformer for its screen. Even 3 weeks after getting my tablet I was watching some clips on Youtube and it looked better then my 42\" HD TV.  I mostly got it for Videos and Games.  Something to pass the time.  But found Google books (and how many classic books are free). I never really have been a big reader, and its still not the same as a book, but having access to it all the time is amazing.  Their are even hidden features I never knew about.  There is voice search, which does work on the web, but also in your music and in your apps.  I used the Navigation feature works so well I wanted to use it all the places I go (which I know where they are).\n\nThe list goes on and on.  I didn't even use my home computer for about 3 days because I could do it all on this Tablet!\n\nBut one problem I did have!  I was cleaning the tablet and found some spots.  After I used my handy fingernail to remove the spots I realized they were behind the glass.  I don't recall seeing them after I got the tablet,  I assume they got in afterwards.  The spots really weren't that bad,  I was just worried dust would get behind the glass.  I called Asus to return it.  The process was simple because I was under warranty.  I did have to pay to ship it back to Asus (in TX).  Fedex was $12 for three days.  I have read on forums that this is has happened to others.  I'm not sure if Asus just rushed a couple to get them out to market (mine was probably the third batch).\n\nMake sure you check your Transformer! Even it check it closely for the first month.\n\nCan't wait to get my tablet back!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I preordered my first TF101-B1 from B&H Photo last month.  Upon turning it on for the first time, I noticed flickering horizontal lines in one quarter of the LCD.  Needless to say, I returned the tablet.  I ordered a second TF101-B1 from Amazon.  It seemed fine for the first day, however, small white sploches developed near the right corner of the screen.  Asus definitely has some quality control issues with their tablet which is a shame.  I'll be returning this tablet to Amazon soon and will have to decide if I want to give Asus a third try.  With the market dominated by Apple at the moment and the flood of Honeycomb tablets being announced, I think Asus has seriously missed the mark as far as producing a top quality device.\n\nThe Gorilla glass is a great feature and doesn't have so much as a mark on it from a couple of days of use with constant cleanings.  The Gorilla glass is also one of the biggest negatives about the device.  It is extremely glossy which makes it pretty much useless outdoors.  However, I think the same can be said about most tablets currently on the market.  The screen also smudges and attracts fingerprints excessively.\n\nSo far as I can tell, the included AC USB power adapter cannot be replaced by another USB power source.  I've tried to use both my ipod and Blackbery AC USB power adapter and cannot charge the tablet.  I'm not sure if the included adapter provide more current than a typical USB power source.  At the moment, accessories are scarce.  If I could find a second power adapter, I'd be happy.  From what I understand, Asus has them listed on their site for around $30 which is a little steep.\n\nLack of any type of USB connector is annoying.  I'm sure Asus will come out with a solution similar to Apple's at some point.\n\nThe last gripe I have is that out of the box, you cannot access the files on the Asus from OS X.  On Windows, the Asus is mounted as an external drive.  To do this on a Mac, you have to install the Android File Transfer softare on your Mac.  Not a big deal, but I'd like to see built-in support in a future Android revision.\n\nThe device itself is excellent.  Besides the screen flaws I've experienced, the image quality is outstanding.  It is extremely responsive to touch.  It doesn't have any problem with running anything that I've installed.  I love Android.  The Android Market is great and does have a lot of application.  Though not nearly as many apps are available in the Android Market as compared to Apple's store, this isn't a real issue.  Who cares if you have a million apps if 99% of them aren't useful to you anyway.  Android has everything I need.  Most apps at this time aren't optimized for tablets, but the majority still look great."}

I've had it for a week, and so far everything works as expected.\n\n*It's my first experience with Android, but I love the fact that the Gmail app handles universal inboxes, for those who use them like me.\n\n*The camera's a bit funky, even with Android 3.1, but I honestly don't see myself using it much. I haven't tested out Skype video chat yet.\n\n*The Asus keyboard works great, I see no reason to switch to the Android keyboard and give up my top row of number keys!\n\n*The one and only thing that bothers me: the video playback. Some videos play just fine: for me I've had some luck with .mkv files, but not so much with .mp4 files (no sound; stuttery frame rate) and some .mp4 files (frame rate is fine, but no sound). I'm using the most popular video player, Moboplayer, so I just assume that the patch for Tegra 2 isn't perfected yet.\n\n*In other areas: web browsing is great - the tablet renders pages very accurately. The microSD card reader works fine and is recognized without delay. The music player is great too, though it would be nice to have a progress bar. Battery lasts an entire day and a bit more without a hitch.\n\nAll in all, a great product, especially for a first-generation Android tablet.\n\nThings I want to see: Microsoft, please release an MS Office suite ASAP (especially OneNote for university students like myself!). That's the only advantage the iPad has - there's full collaboration between iOS and Mac OS (along with iWork) since they are one and the same organization, while Microsoft and Android (Google) are quite separate. I'll be waiting.\n\n*UPDATE*\nI forgot to mention that in the past week I set up the SplashTop software, which allows remote access to any computer that is turned on and connected to the internet. It is similar to LogMeIn, for those familiar with it, but runs far more smoothly - even 1080p videos are at watchable quality streaming from my desktop! (to be fair, I haven't touched LogMeIn for about four years). You can set up SplashTop for access from within the same network AND from outside the network. Setting up the latter requires a bit of fooling around with the port-forwarding settings inside your router; the SplashTop website offers a great guide to doing so.\n\nThis newly discovered feature increases the awesomeness of this tablet (well, any tablet) further!\n\nUPDATE #2:\nSorry, I should have posted this earlier but I've been busy:\nAfter about two weeks of happily using the tablet, the power button became unresponsive. Amazon's excellent customer service replaced it right away. The replacement unit, however, could not update from 3.0 to 3.1. I returned the second unit for a refund.\nI'm very disappointed with this experience and I hope it was just an isolated incident. Unfortunately, there are several reports of both problems in online forums. I have owned two Asus netbooks before and they are quality products. However, something must have gone seriously wrong with the quality control for the Transformer. I hope to be a potential customer in a few years, but not anytime soon.

The higher resolution makes such a difference with detail.\n\nI won't lower my rating for this, but it's something to keep in mind. This is my second Transformer. I returned the first because the light bleed was extra bad, and I witnessed a dead pixel appear and stay. On my current Transformer there was a large dust chunk under the glass about 1/4 of an inch from the bottom of the screen. It was very noticable. I managed to get it to drop out of view by tapping near it on the screen. It seems to be stuck there hidden now, so I'm fine with it. Either way, both cases were frustrating.\n\nAll in all - this thing is very customizable, and it's more of a PC experience with a nice Android touch overlay.

The typical way of use the tablet is one hand to hold it and another hand to use it when sitting in the sofa or on the bed. For a 10\" tablet. It's very difficult hold it with with your palm and grab with the finger. I have to have those 7 foot NBA player's hand(big size) to hold it without feeling tired. Otherwise, I have to put it on my laps or somewhere(such as table) to use it comfortably. If a tablet requires you put it on your laps or a table. you'd better to get a notebook or netbook. It's also too big to carry around. I guess Apple is the only company realize the usability issue from the experience of iPad 1. That's why Apple reduced size and weight quite significantly besides the performance improvement for iPad2.\n\n* It's only useful for the reading. When I read emails, some case I really want to reply. The soft keyboard is not as convenient physical keyboard. There is a keyboard docking for the device, but the additional cost makes the device close to a very decent notebook, much more expensive than a netbook.\n\n* Not all my video collection(some recorded from camcorder, digital camera, some downloadeded, some recorded from PC TV card) can be played on the devices. On windows I can play all of them. I just need to download klite paks, it works fine.\n\n* The touch UI is not as smooth as iPad/iPhone. Some cases don't response to my finger.

The first one that I owned had a power button issue in which I had to press the button in as hard as I could to get it to go into sleep mode, come out of sleep mode or power the device on.  I did factory resets, updated to the latest android version, reverted to the old version, and nothing would fix it.  It got so bad that after just 3 days of owning the device, it wouldn't power on at all no matter how hard I pressed it (even though plugging the USB cable in would cause it to wake right up and work fine).  Back to the store for a full refund after that.\n\nI decided to give it another shot, given the mostly stellar reviews (and the fact that I do really love this device even though I initially got a bad unit). After a week of searching for a retailer with one in stock, I ordered another.  This one came with a completely unresponsive touch screen.  Sent back.\n\nI again had to wait until I found one in stock since these devices are scarce.  Amazon got some more in stock finally, so I ordered another.  I opened the box and carefully inspected the unit.  The power button looked like it had been installed at a 45 degree angle and was much more recessed than the volume buttons.  I plugged it in and let it charge up anyway.  Despite obviously being installed incorrectly, I decided to give it a go and turned the unit on.  The button had a nice click (unlike the last 2 devices) and seemed to work okay, so I proceeded to enter my Google information and set up the device.  I would have ignored this minor issue, but as I was finishing setting it up, a bunch of blue lines flickered across the right side of the display panel.  Back to Amazon it goes tomorrow.\n\nI actually did use the first unit I had for a few days and aside from the power button issue, it was superb.  The 5-star ratings on here are spot on, the display has fantastic viewing angles, Honeycomb operating system is fantastic, storage expandability, battery life, etc., but the quality control (or lack of) is just completely unacceptable.

Heck, it has a file browser.\n\nBottom line - if you prefer to be spoon fed and sand boxed into a gorgeous, slick device that won't let you down and can be passed from toddler to Grandpa without a hitch get the iPad.\n\nOn the other hand - If you are looking for openness in your device and the possibilities that come with it, or are simply feeling more adventurous because you mastered the \"press icon\", \"play\", \"press home button\" and repeat thingy this is for you!\n\nUpdate 9/14/11 (these issues fixed see update 11/7/11 below)\n\nI have to gripe about two WIFI related issues that are still not resolved and drive me mad.  No, connectivity is fine that's not the issue.  One issue is that leaving WIFI on, *even* when the option to disconnect after some period is enabled, drains the battery a lot so that I often find myself grabbing the tablet a day or two later only to find it out of juice.  So I must remember to always turn of WIFI when done.  Really?  The second is a pretty well known issue regarding corporate enterprise networks like at my work, in particular when using 802.1x EAP I cannot connect to it apparently it's something google/android broke around the 2.3 update and hasn't fixed since then get it together people!\n\nOtherwise still 5 stars for this beauty and the 3.2 update did really smooth some things out.\n\nUpdate 11/7/11\n\nI updated to the new Android version 3.2.1 and both problems mentioned above have been resolved.  I am thrilled to finally be able to log into our corporate network.  And I haven't noticed the battery drain issue.  Excellent!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "The ASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101-A1 is a great new Android 3.0 tablet (3.1 update available) for the rest of us who aren't attracted to luxury brand names over capability and functionality.  I now leave my laptop at home while on business travel, as I am able to handle my VPN accessed work email, administrative requirements, Word document view/editing (compatible), Excel spreadsheet view/editing (compatible), PowerPoint view/editing/presentation (compatible) via both HDMI and DAC VGA, video presentation via both HDMI and DAC VGA, right from the tablet and it has performed very well.  It is light weight (compared to my netbooks or laptop), the battery has a long life (7+ hours for my general use), the IPS display is clear and crisp, and the build quality is solid (despite appearance, and some slight plastic-on-plastic creaking when squeezed in just the right way (or wrong way)).\n\nThe performance is 5 stars, but I am only giving it 4 stars as the full functionality isn't available without a few missing accessories (ASUS has a new case, mini HMDI, DAC VGA module, docking port USB cable coming... sometime in the future), and the failed supply/availability.  If you don't want the extra battery life, and weight that goes with it, I recommend a bluetooth keyboard (there's a small folding qwerty keyboard here on Amazon for a reasonable price).\n\nA word of caution - this table sells for $399 when sold by an authorized ASUS reseller, which is just about any major retailer.  Do not support the vultures trying to capitalize on the shortage, as they are no better than gray marketers. They have purchased thier inventory from a major retailer only to resell them here on Amazon (or eBay) and reap large profits for doing nothing more than depleting and monopolizing the limited availability of the ASUS Transformer.  More are on the way from ASUS, and they will sell for $399.  I am going to buy another one, as my daughter wants to replace her netbook, but I will wait until the \"real\" $399 shipment comes in and not contribute to vulture piracy.  Amazon should not support this type of 'dark market resale' and neither should we - don't feed the animals!\n\nUpdate:  ~2 weeks after my 2nd Transformer purchase.\nI've been using the Bluetooth keyboard with the Transformer for a while now, and am quite pleased with the performance.  I am also using an HDMI to mini-HDMI adapter with HP's HDMI-VGA adapter for display on monitors/projectors with VGA and no HDMI, and it works very well.  I have been using the cheap Arkon tablet holder (while I wait for my leather portfolio made for the Transformer), and it works very well.  Another benefit I have found with my current setup is that I can place the transformer next to the projector, with access to power and video hookup, and sit 10-15 feet away with my mini-bluetooth keyboard and control everything - obviates the whole issue of cord length and associated inconvenience.\n\n  The entire suite I bring with me on business travel takes 1/2 the room of my laptop, and less than 1/3 the weight.  It is also much less hassle to setup, whether on a plane or in a conference room, and I appreciate the flexibility I have in choosing what options I will use.  I see new or adapted Honeycomb apps every day, and have been very please overall with how well everything is functioning.  The screen and system continues to be responsive, plenty of memory with no slowdown even after adding and changing dozens of apps.  Still waiting for the ASUS docking port USB adapter to be released, but with a 32GB SD and WiFi, it's not a critical shortcoming."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "There are enough lengthly reviews out there about the Transformer already.  Most have pegged exactly the pros and cons of this device.  No need to restate what is already out there.\n\nI've been waiting for a long time to get something more portable than my laptop and never thought the Netbook really solved anything.  The Asus Transformer w/ the keyboard dock in my opinion is the future of mobile computing.  Battery life is long enough for easily being used all day without being plugged in.  I can use my keyboard to take notes, quickly respond to e-mails, etc.  I disabled the track pad because I think it's too easy to accidentally touch and move your cursor, so I use the touch screen and the physical keyboard.  In this configuration it is just like typing on my notebook.  Keyboard is easy to adjust to and very responsive.\n\nHoneycomb 3.1 is great.  I can plug in my digital camera, download pictures and even upload them right to Picasa.  I use Dropbox to manage any files I need on the go and usually use PDFs in Dropbox with the ezPDF app to view and markup.  With that app I simply open my PDF, can read and even handwrite notes using my finger or capacitive stylus, save the file and the next time I'm at my desk I have my PDF with my handwritten notes on it.  This is what having a tablet is all about!\n\nSurprisingly few have commented on the business apps.  Calendar and e-mail are great with great Exchange support.  I've had no problems and find that I like Honeycomb's clients better than Outlook 95% of the time.  The bundled office software is not a full featured word process (no spell check and multi-level outlines aren't the greatest) but it is probably the best mobile office suite available, and you get it for free with the Transformer.  For taking notes and writing simple documents it works great.  Contrary to what I've read other places I have been able to view and edit Office 2010 docs (.docx, .xlsx and .pptx) files.\n\nOverall, it's a great tablet.  Exactly what I've been waiting for.  Haven't undocked my laptop from my desk since my Transformer arrived."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "After the Android version 3.1 update, the web browser no longer reflects tabs at the top when opening multiple web sites. Perhaps this is just my unit that does this, I don't know. Also the thumb swipe, to get the side menu in the browser, no longer holds the menu for selection. You have to continue pressing your thumb against the glass while selecting the option you want. I preferred the way it worked before, where the menu popped up and stayed there until you pressed the glass again.\n\nI knew this going in but, neither Netflix nor Hulu play on the Android operating system for this system. I'm sure someone is working on correcting this issue but, until it's addressed, it's a major drawback for the platform. I'd give it a whole additional star once video is supported from these two sites. On the plus side, most the sites I went to that used flash video worked great.\n\nI downloaded the free Amazon Kindle app as soon as I got the Asus unit. For my purposes the Kindle app works well for reading the Kindle books I've purchased. It's nice having a choice of the Kindle device or the back-lit screen of the Asus for reading books.\n\nThe built in app for Navigation works well. Once you establish your destination, the Asus unit will shout out voice commands directing you to the destination, all the while showing your progress on the displayed map.\n\nI bought this as a toy primarily. Most the real work I do will continue to be done on a PC. For myself, there's too many applications that I use on the PC that aren't available yet on the Android or Ipad.\n\nI'm satisfied with my purchase, and got what I expected from the Asus unit so far.\n\nUpdate: 09/17/2011\n\nI'd up this to 4 stars now. A recent update allows Netflix to play video on the device. Netflix now works like a champ, and the dimensions of the Asus are perfect for watching movies in widescreen format."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "My first tablet but I have owned iphones and used ipads. Most reviewers compare it to an Ipad2 and I will do the same. Why? because I believe 90% of shoppers looking at this item are asking \"why should I get this over an Ipad2?\"\n\nThis one is hands down the best Android tablet out there for the price. If you want better Android tablets you will have to look in the $600+ price range.\n\nHad it for about a week. When I first got it it was slow, buggy and there were no apps! I was very close to returning it. But decided to give it another shot. The Honeycomb update that came out a few days later fixed 90% of my problems. I noticed new apps come out for it on a daily basis so this is not a problem for me either. Now I am 100% satisfied with this tablet. The secret: it takes a few days to draw your conclusions, not a few hours.\n\nPros:\n- Price\n- Beautiful screen on par or better than ipad2\n- Open, unlike ipad2 you can install any app you want including 3rd party apps\n- To me, Honeycomb OS seems more modern and cutting edge compared to Apple's OS. More setting controls, live widgets, live wallpaper, theming, tons of things apple's lacks\n- Flash. Huge advantage over Ipad IMO\n- Solid construction, nice textured backpanel for the hands.\n- Good apps included: Office, Remote Control your pc, share files over network\n- HDMI, microSD reader\n- Open! you can play your music/videos without loading it to your library using Itunes or Icloud. Hey, you can even play your friends music/videos, it just works without the hassle!\n\nCons:\n- Not a lot of apps YET. This will change but if you are impatient and need tons of apps today, I recommend to get the Ipad. This is not Asus limitation but Android. I was about to return it for this sole reason but gave it another shot and this device won me over.\n- Not as light and thin as Ipad2. But then again this is much cheaper.\n- No USB port on tablet.\n\nAll in all this tablet deserves 5 stars.\n\nWhy I chose it over Ipad? See my pros above. The openness and less hassle to play/copy/open your media including Flash. The ability to install any app you want on it.\n\nIf you don't like to wait, don't want to learn and don't mind apple's restrictions, get the ipad2. If you are a bit patient and like control of your media/files/apps get this one."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I have an iPad and also use an Android Phone (Nexus One), so I thought this might be a great extra device.  While it's good for the lower price, it doesn't have the polish and options compared to the iPad yet - it's close though.  I'm running the latest version of the OS, 3.1.\n\nBottom line:  The price and built-in GPS are benefits over the iPad, but the lack of apps, cases, cheaper build quality and poor customer service give the iPad the edge for now.  Also, this is a widescreen device, unlike the iPad, which makes it well suited for movies, but the magazine-shaped iPad is better suited to reading content.\n\nPros:\n- Price - can't beat it!\n- Built-in GPS (great with Navigon)\n- Can run Flash, if desired\n- micro SD slot\n- Has keyboard option that extends battery life\n\nCons:\n- Screen is great, but not quite iPad quality IMO (lots of edge light bleeding)\n- Customer service can't compare to Apple where you can exchange at any store\n- Uses non-standard charger cable adapter (wish it was micro USB)\n- Web browser isn't as smooth as iPad (many elements pop in while scrolling)\n- UI is confusing (even compared to Android on my Nexus One) - no consistent menu button?!?\n- Few apps (especially kids /educational) ... I know, I know - they're coming, but still.\n- Few, if any, good case options yet\n- GPS doesn't work consistently, need to turn on & off in Settings\n- I personally don't like the widescreen aspect - harder to read content / web pages.\n\nAfter using it for several days, it's grown on me, but I still can't justify this over the iPad which just has so many more options, a better build quality and screen dimensions better suited to reading content.\n\nI'm sure Android enthusiasts and programmers will jump on my comparison to the iPad in the comments section, but I think this is how the general population will feel about it in a direct comparison to the iPad.  If I had to recommend a tablet today to a friend or family member, it would still be the iPad (even for $100 more)."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I got my ASUS 16GB Eee Pad w/o dock thro' bestbuy ($399+tax), and have been using it for 2 weeks and absolutely love it. I have used an ipad before, and was tempted to get a tablet, but I simply didn't want an ipad because of the basic \"press-this-icon\" feature of the ipad. I already have an iphone (and love that too) and didn't want a big slate with the same features. Android is lovely-- it gives an experience that's midway between a laptop and a phone; customizable screens, 3rd party unrestricted apps, widgets, and a lot more. I love the openness and the possibilities. I use it for my morning browsing in bed, and casual browsing throughout the day.\n\nSome pros and cons:\n\n+ The screen is absolutely beautiful; wide-angle format, good viewing angles, and very responsive.\n  (may get a screen protector to cut the glare, though)\n+ Android 3.1 rocks\n+ Wonderful experience in between a laptop and a phone\n+ Format is great for browsing the net, watching movies, reading comics, reading magazines and newspapers (especially the printed editions), google earth, sky maps, etc.\n+ Flash content\n\n- There are very few apps currently available. In particular, I miss the Netflix app and have to turn to my laptop/iphone.\n- The exchange web mail server does not have a search function. Very irritating.\n- There's no USB connectivity unless I get the dock (though I haven't needed this so far).\n\nMost of the cons above are fixable and will probably get fixed soon.\nBut I am very happy I didn't get the ipad instead!\n\nI would recommend this seriously to anyone wanting to try a tablet and who doesn't want the \"click-these-icons\" interface of the ipad."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Have bought the 16GB version for one month now with roughly 3-4 hour usage everyday. The performance of the tablet is very impressive, especially with games recommended by TegraZone (Samurai II, Pinball HD, etc). All my friends are tempered to jump for this when they saw my table in action.\n\n- Compare to iPad\n\nI had a iPad and that quickly became a child education tool and ebook reader. Simply could not bear the bulky iTune and video conversion process. There are definitely a lot more to play with the Android system than iPad, especially I can share purchased apps between my phone and the tablet, unlike iOs (no more rough images when using iPhone apps on iPad because of).\n\n- UI and apps\n\nHighlight of Android is definitely the widgets. Those are just life savers since you don't need to switch between screens with numerous clicks (fingers got tired quickly). Settings toggle buttons are especially handy. Calculator, dictionary, email/gmail and of course weather widgets are wonderful to use daily.\nNow just yesterday I finally got my docking station delivered. Previously I would feel (strangely) a little stressed whenever a text box need to be filled, that's not true anymore. The keyboard, touch pad and extra USB ports really make it a real computer. I'm planning to get VPN and VNC viewer working so that I can leave my laptop at home completely if necessary.\nAs mentioned in the beginning, games from TegraZone really delight the experience with this tablet.\nWith the Wii Controller IME + SNES9 Ex + TV, I could use my tablet as a real SNES game console, that is a very pleasant experience, and brought me back to the good old days.\n\n- Battery\n\nThe battery life with tablet only was not exceeding my expectation, while still reasonable enough. In the past weekend I played planets vs zombies (btw. this is tablet version, very nice) for an entire afternoon and battery lasted merely 6 hours. With the addition of docking I think there would be no concern with battery anymore.\n\n- Screen\n\nThere have been discussions of back light bleeding and I was really worried initially since I noticed two small spot-light type bleed at the bottom (status) bar when enabling full brightness and use it in dark light. Then when looking at online pictures, seems that's not of a concern. Some very dim light area can be noticed at upper-right side on my unit when in dark rooms. So not a problem for me at all.\n\n- Video\n\nVideo playback is very smooth after Honeycomb 3.1 update and I'm pleased with it. Only negative so far is the hdmi output. It doesn't display 1080p when connected to TV which is really desired.\n\n- Stability\n\nI did experience system black-out twice in the first week of usage. The table just showed black screen and I was not sure what happened. After a reboot (without seeing the screening) I was able to recover. That hasn't happened after Honeycomb 3.01 update. So I'm temporarily not worried.\n\n- Conclusion\n\nAll in all, very good experience with the Transformer tablet in past one month and I would have given 4.5 star if possible. The bonus 0.5 star here is for the innovation and effort (quick OS upgrade) Asus has shown me."}

I am compelled to do so with all the negative reviews that i find mostly (not all) dishonest. I ordered my EEE Pad Tranformer last week through Amazon.com. The seller was Pavilion Electronics. I read the all reviews and some of them scared me to the point of returning my order. A lot of talk about a cheaply made bezel that is detached from the unit, 5 sec delay, or light leaks...\n\nFirst let me tell you, i own the iPhone, iTouch, shuffle, iPad 1 (sold last month for iPad2), then i just bought the iPad 2. All Apple devices great products, and i still have the iPad2 but i gave it to my wife because i got sick of Apples limitations and being forced to live in an Apple world. So i got the Asus eee pad transformer due to the great experiences ive had with the eee PC HE1001, the dang thing is bulletproof and still works well running off the new ubuntu os. I also recently bought the eee All in one touch screen PC INT2400...i love it. So i decided to pull the trigger on eee Transformer since i wanted an Andriod OS device.\n\nHere is my opinion:\n- Apple iPad has a more responsive touch screen\n- Apple OS is a more stable operating system\n- Apple has better HD video playback\n- eee Transformer equally well constructed as iPad\n- eee Screen is equal if not better than iPad\n- Android OS has a better looking interface and more flexible than Apple OS\n- eee feels just a durable as iPad\n- eee battery life is equal than iPad\n- eee web surfing seems slightly faster than iPad\n\nOverall, i love the eee Transformer and i could not put it down they day i got it. Its on par with the iPad in my opinion. However, i am a google fanatic and it loads my life up (gmail, gchat, gcalendar, contacts....) instantly. I have the updated Honeycomb 3.01 which seems to have solved most issues but i would still like to see smoother video streaming since i spend a lot of time on Amazon prime instant video and i would like to see the Netflix app for android.\n\nThe eee Transformer is very solid in construction and feel. It has the same gorilla glass used in most high end tablets. I can't see how other people are getting the busted up Asus eee Transformers unless there have been sellers selling knock offs or something. If you check reviews off amazon they are nothing but stellar. I went to read cnet reviews, gizmod, pcworld...you name it all great reviews. That leads me to think that there are some paid bashers on these reviews which forced me to respond.\n\nI hope this helps."}

Xoom is way overpriced and the screen is embarrassing.  If you are competing with the iPAD and have the nerve to charge the same price, at least you can make a comparable screen.  The Xoom screen always appears faded like there is a haze on top.  Even at max brightness, text is never crisp.  Their LCD does a disservice to the physical resolution.\n\nThe Acer is bulky and not very stylish.  The screen is also a bit washed out.  The device can get bogged down at times and there is no native Exchange support.  Major oversight!  The XOOM and the EEE Pad both have native Exchange support.\n\nAnd now my opinion of the ASUS EEE Pad.  Absolutely sexy device, very thin, great IPS display on par with the Ipad1 and 2.  The device does not get bogged down and everything flows beautifully which begets more use.  The screen is precise, crisp and responsive.  Text is clear at any brightness.  Well done ASUS!\n\nLastly, if there is anything not on par with the iPAD, it would be the OS which falls just short of IOS polish.  Honeycomb does beat the the iPAD with its notification system, but this will be short-lived since Apple announced today that it too will have a notification system this Fall."}

I was anxious to try out Honeycomb and this device has been hyped up quite heavily.  I currently use an iPad 2 for many tasks, but have found the closed ecosystem it lives in to be frustrating at times.  This is mostly because I work in IT and prefer to have a little more control than what iOS offers.  From this perspective, Android prevails in terms of versatility.\n\nI will say that for the price this is a nice Honeycomb tablet.  However, for the extra hundred bucks I still feel that the iPad 2 will provide a better experience for most consumers.  The tegra 2 doesnt seem to be able to power honeycomb with the smoothness or efficiency of an iPad.  There is definitely a place for android tablets to exist but I predict they will struggle to overtake the iPad in sales just because of very obvious differences in user interface and it's responsiveness.  Everything is smooth, snappy and seamless on iPad, where the transformer, while more useful in some aspects, just feels much slower and fragmented.  Video playback is also much cleaner as well.\n\nThe battle between Apple and Google feels similar to that between Mac OS and Windows.  Some will prefer a simpler, more cohesive interface (iPad) while others will rather use a more flexible but quirky platform (Android)\n\nIn close I wish I could give 3 and a half stars, because I do see this is a decent value and peice of hardware.  However side by side with an iPad it feels extremely laggy, messy and all around unfriendly.  The touch screen sensitivity and response time are terrible when compared.  am also running the 3.1 update, for anyone who may be wondering."}

On both units, it was extremely loose, to the point of displacing a couple millimeters while I was holding it. On the worse of the two, the band was loose along almost the entire top edge. On the second, it was only on one corner, but still moving enough to cause concern.\n\nAlso, on the second unit, the battery repeatedly discharged from full to less than 10% in under 90 minutes - after being charged overnight.  Whether this was a software glitch or a bad battery, I'm not sure.  But I'm not willing to bet on the warranty.\n\nI should note that I've been using Asus motherboards almost exclusively for more than 10 years, and also have a bulletproof Asus netbook that has never failed to perform. So, I'm not an Asus hater or anything.\n\n(As usual, Amazon's customer service and return policies are superb!)\n\nI have a third unit coming next week.  If this one has problems, I'll pay the difference and get a Samsung instead.\n\nUPDATE: I received a new unit from Amazon, and it seems much tighter than the other two. No dust under the glass, but there are still four light leaks along the bottom of the screen, noticeable even in bright light if the background color is dark.  This unit also has the audio issue, wherein the right speaker is substantially louder than the left -- to the point where I had to put my ear to the left speaker to make sure it was playing at all.\n\nI'm not sure whether I'll keep this one or return it and get a Galaxy 10.1 instead.  I love the feature set of the Asus, but those features mean nothing if they don't work properly."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I have to say that I think ASUS makes a lot of great products but this just isn't one of them.  I am sadly returning this item within a week of receiving it even though I was initially very excited about buying one.\n\nUpon turning on the tablet for the first time I immediately noticed some pretty serious backlight leakage along the bottom and left sides of the screen.  This is pretty noticeable to me even in a relatively well lit room.  The touch felt a little bit less responsive than I'd like as well and I also swear there was a little bit of flex to the screen which I found quite odd.\n\nBuild quality overall is actually pretty good though and I think ASUS made a pretty good cost vs quality judgement as with most of their products.  I think they could've used a slightly better material for the back such as the soft-touch plastic used in ThinkPads but overall the tablet feels pretty solid in the hand and I didn't notice too much creaking like some of the other reviewers mentioned.\n\nI must say that Honeycomb itself honestly offers a relatively mediocre tablet experience though.  It really just feels unstreamlined and sluggish at times.  Even just opening the app drawer feels laggy and the ASUS custom keyboard feels rather sluggish to respond as well.\nAt least the browser is pretty good though with a nice tabbed interface and flash support of course.  With some more apps and updates to work out the kinks Android could work relatively well on tablets, but we'll see how it fares vs Windows 8 next year.\n\nPerhaps a version two of the ASUS Eee Pad will do much better, but for now I really wouldn't recommend buying this device unless you really just want an Android tablet right now."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Yesterday I received an ASUS EEE Pad Transformer that is completely defective. Whenever the screen opens an app with lots of white - i.e. gmail, browser, market, or if you point the camera at a white wall - the screen goes completely blank instantly. You must push the power button twice to get to the unlock screen, but when you unlock it, the screen goes blank right away once again. This leaves the device unusable.\n\nI have searched online and other people have this as well as similar issues in regards to the tablet. The tablet initially had wonderful reviews, which is why I purchased it, but according to many of the statements I have found online now - ASUS's new shipment of the product is extremely low quality (after selling out quickly of the first product line). Other people have this issue, or their screen breaks after two days, or their power button stops working, or there are light leaks, etc. If this is how ASUS is \"meeting demand,\" then by no means would I recommend it unless you want a $400 paper weight. I was extremely excited for this but am now incredibly disappointed. What's more, ASUS's \"customer support\" is anything but supportive - it is a truly frustrating experience. The menu keeps telling me they are out of office even though it is their work hours according to their menu. I found a different number, which told me to hang up and call another number if my issue was related to the EEE series. So I did, but then that number told me to hang up and call another number... and on and on."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Had the tablet 15 minutes before the touch screen stopped responding entirely.  Up until that point it seemed to be a really great product.  It only took the machine falling asleep one time before it broke.  I tried unlocking but it would not register any touch.  I could move volume up and down as well as restart and restore factory settings, however the touch never came back.  Asus wanted me to send it to them at MY cost to repair it.  Unacceptable.  This seems to be at least a fairly common issue if you google it.  I don't want to take a chance this will happen again, so I will be waiting on a different Android tablet to come out."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I didn't believe all the 1* reviews, but the item came poorly assembled, had a damaged volume rocker and has the infamous creaking on the left side. There is a gap between the bronze colored bezel wrapping around the tablet where you can see the sides of the volume rocker and power button. The backing itself reminds me of plastic made for preschool toys like miniature kitchens or play bench/tables. When tapped on, it gives off a hollow sound and to top it off, the area below the asus logo had a sticky residue on it for some reason. The thin black plastic between the glass screen and the bezel appeared to have several indentations giving it an uneven look on the upper left hand corner making me wonder if this was a refurbished unit. There was a small defect on the front like somebody tried to stick a pin between the edge of the screen and the bronze portion of the chassis.\n\nUPDATE: Got another unit. No dents, scratches or blemishes and it worked out of the box. However, it will not update to honeycomb 3.1 over the air and the screen brightness can not be adjusted so this one is going back too. The screen flickered during the initial boot although I cannot verify that that was what caused the issue."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I was a little skeptical about buying this product after reading all the bad reviews, but apparently I was lucky and got one of the good ones. The TF that I got is solid and it doesn't creek or squeek like other reviewers have stated. It was lighter than I expected when I took it out of the box as well. It seemed lighter than the Xoom to me. The user interface is also very quick and snappy. Coming from an Android phone, I got used to the Honeycomb OS pretty quickly. I really had no problems with this device at all... There were no SD card problems, WiFi problems, or anything else. It even plays 720p videos really smoothly which was a plus for me cause I love watching movies (in high def especially). I have yet to try 1080p, but I will update as soon as I do."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "It is so nice to have a tablet that you can just plug into your pc and drag and drop music, videos, files, and games instead on relying heavily on Itunes like the Ipad 2.  You hear alot of good things about this tablet .  I'm going to give you some cons I experienced using this wonderful tablet.\n\n1.  Online video streaming can be a tad jerky and not as intuitative as the ipad 2.  Web page scrolling slows down heavily when you have a bunch of video thumbnails on a page.  Pinch zoom in and out can be jerky at times and can hickups. This might be more of the Honeycomb OS issue that can be fix with future updates.\n\n2.  Non-customize OS navigation menu sucks.  I hope with future updates, you are allow to move the Android OS menu (home, back, etc.) to the side or top like windows 7.  Having a fixed OS menu at the bottom has it's disadvantages.  Maybe this is why Ipad2 has a phyisical home button.  Certain games like nes or snes has the virtual controller right next by the OS menu which you can accidentally hit these navigation buttons when playing a game.\n\n3.  I realized that certain web site with web form doesn't work well or not at all under Android.  Alot of web site will go to it's mobile web page by default and there's no way to go to it's full webpage site. Website with multiple pop up windows does not work well with the Android browser.\n\n4.  Proxy address setting can be a bitch.  You have to download an app that unlock a hidden proxy setting menu in order to use it.\n\nPros\n1. With the annoucement of next year release of windows 8 compatibility with Tegra processor for tablet open opportunity for a dual boot for this tablet of Android OS/Windows 8 OS.  Windows 8 will have 2 modes, standard mouse mode and tablet friendly mode like used on windows phone."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I had been looking forward to this Tab for a long while.  Hardware specs and reviews were good.  I received mine last week, and immediately noticed a screen calibration problem.  When I would type, it would often select the letter next to the one I pressed.  I would backspace and VERY CAREFULLY choose the letter I wanted to type, and it would pick the wrong one.  Also, in the Browser, I would often have to press about a half inch below the hyper link I wanted to select.  This often resulted in selecting the wrong link (above the one I was trying to select).  I thought these issues might be fixed with the Android 3.1 update, but unfortunately they were not.  After 5 days of use, I found it impossibly frustrating to type or browse on this tablet and am returning it today.  Probably just a defective unit, but I am going with a different brand and model to replace."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I am extremely happy with my eeePad Transformer. I purchased the tablet and the dock separately using nowinstock.net and was able to get them in the third week of may. Since then I have used it every day for multiple hours. I use it to read books on the daily train commute and watch movies on it. I also use it to chat a lot and the keyboard is very useful for that. I can easily switch to video chat and pop- the tablet out and walk around with it. The SD card slot means I can take photos and instantly pop in the SD card from the DSLR in to the dock and see a bigger version of the photos. No need find the cables or copy the files to your computer for quick showings to other people.\n\nASUS is amazing with the updates. They said that 3.1 will come in June and there it was bang on time on the 1st. I am extremely happy and satisfied with this device and can not find any flaws with it.\n\nFirst day I was disappointed with the screen as I could not see the text for the books or dark scenes in videos as the reflection from the glass was too much. Since then I have learned to increase the brightness to full to mitigate this issue while reading books or watching videos and then switch back to auto brightness. The quick shortcut to the settings in the lower right in honeycomb makes it a breeze to change this setting quickly."}

The capacitive sensor had a bunch of dead spots and, when I called Asus to get an RMA, I was hung up on 3 times, transferred to the wrong department 4 times, and ended up having to get an RMA from somebody in an entirely different department after begging them not to transfer me.\n\nWhen I finally got the RMA, I was told I would have to pay for shipping both to and from Asus for the defective product they let slip through quality control. I ended up returning it to the store. Asus used to have amazing customer support, but it has somehow become completely awful.\n\nIf you get one that works, it's a fine tablet but I would caution anyone considering this tablet to be aware that the support for it is absolutely terrible."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I just received my Transformer a few days ago. I was a bit scared after reading some of the horror stories about the tablet BUT everything about it is wonderful. I've had to play with it to get myself familiar where and what everything does but I'm really loving it! My son updated it with the new 3.1 update and Youtube works perfectly and in HD quality! Awesome!\n\nAs far as some saying that it's build isn't very good, I haven't experienced anything negative about the way it feels in my hand. Feels solid to me. I can get a bit on the heavy side but I expected that, I just rest it on my lap and because the screen angle still looks good it works out great! Like I said, everything feels solid on it, the buttons, the glass. Also, the speakers sound great, no bass but I knew that as well. Just pop in a good set of headphones and the sound is great! I use Skull Candy earbuds from Target.\n\nMy son and I have been converting some of our DVD collections to play on the Transformer. I wish this was a bit more streamlined on how to get the video onto your TF...and the video isn't full screen like I thought it would be but that's no a show stopper for me. Plenty of apps to accomodate playing the video at near full screen.\n\nOnly one thing that I would say needs improvement with the operating system is there needs to be more menu driven items and functionality. A newbie who purchases a tablet such as this can easily get discouraged by having to dig through screens to find what they are looking for, it can be a bit daunting for someone who isn't real confortable with touchscreen or Windows type operating systems.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with my purchase!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I purchased the Transformer with the keyboard from Amazon recently.  Before I bought it, I was on the fence between this tablet, Ipad2 and the yet to be released Toshiba Android tablet.  I had a hard time deciding between getting the Ipad2 and this Transformer tablet since I already have some investment with Apple/Itunes because of my iphone4.  But the ability to run flash programs, built in GPS in the base unit, with microSD external storage and a larger screen with more resolution was the swaying factor.  I'm neither an Apple or Google fanboy.  I just want stuff to work and make my life easier or fun.\n\nFirst, the display unit is very nice and sharp.  It is a bit glossy and it will reflect quite a bit and it's also a finger print magnet.  It's also has a tackiness as you finger will not glide as easy as you might expect but these are minor quibbles.  I don't mind the back shell of unit as well as some others have commented that it feels cheap.  It feels fine to me.\n\nIt's major disadvantage seems to be weak wifi performance.  I have a Dlink N router and none of my laptops or iphone have any performance issues around my house.  The tablet frequently registers fair to poor signal strength with wifi dropping off sporadically.  I've altered my router to use a different channel which seemed to help the reliability of the connection but data rate is poor overall.  But with wifi being it's only lifeline, you'd expect it to perform better.\n\nVideo playback at 1080p is not great either.  I've tried streaming from DLNA source and on the microSD of some 1080p movies and the frame rates are very choppy.  You'll get one second of video and about 2 seconds of freezing.  Playback on DVD definition video is adequate but not great.  No freezing but doesn't seem very smooth.  With the recent update to 3.1 Honeycomb did improve video playback, but it didn't fix the video playback problem.  I will have to try some movies at 720p to see if that helps.\n\nThis is my first experience with Google Android.  On some things like the browser or Google Earth the system works great with the touch interface and provides a near seamless experience.  But it still needs a lot more polishing all around.  When I pinch and zoom in Google Earth, it won't zoom in or out in the area I'm pinching in, just the center of the screen.  You can't pinch and zoom in an email either.  The browser has flash support, some sites won't recognize it as a full fledged browser and redirects you to the mobile version of their website so you can't access the flash version of their sites.  When you do get a site with flash, it seems slow.  The other thing that's a nuisance is that some apps prefer to run in either portrait or landscape mode and you can't switch seamlessly around from both for certain apps.  It is a pain to switch to portrait mode with keyboard attached.  I still have other glitches where my keyboard would disappear and become non functional until I take the tablet off and plug it back in and I've gotten a few lock ups with video playback.  Switching the wifi off/on seems to put it in a quandary sometimes.  Overall, 3.1 Android still feels unfinished.\n\nIt's a bit disappointing in the end, I took one star off for unfinished Android experience and another star off for awful wifi performance/range and 1080p playback which is important to me.  The only glimmer of hope is that these issues may get resolved with a future update.  Then again, maybe I got a bad unit or my expectations were too high.\n\n6/5/2011 Update:  You can pinch/zoom in the browser by turning off Auto-fit page option in the browser.  720P movies works but bogs down when there are heavy changes in the video.  There's a rhythmic change in speed every second.  It's very subtle but noticeable in slow smooth pans in video.  720 over DLNA works fine.  Youtube video browser is pretty good.  Network still drops out for no reason.  I just realized there's no easy way to print from the tablet.\n\n7/20/2011 Update:  Just updated firmware which seem to address the problem of the wifi not picking up my wireless after coming out of sleep mode.  Not sure what else the update addressed.\n\n8/29/2011 Update:  Applied the 3.2 update a few weeks ago and just updated with a new firmware.  I'm happy to say the lumpiness in 720 playback speed has been fixed.  The odd thing was some of the 1080 playback has gotten a bit worse.  In the past, the files would at least load and playback with lots of choppiness.  Now 1080 files will not load at all.  A step backwards in a feature that wasn't working properly to begin with.\n\nAlso, the battery life with the docking station has improved dramatically.  Before the update, the tablet would run out of juice 1.5 days when tablet + docking station was just sleeping.  So far it's been about 3-4 days and it still has about 70% battery left.\n\nI worked around my wifi problem by buying an access point and installing closer to where I normally would use it.  I haven't investigated whether the wifi performance has improved with the new firmware and the with the original router.  I know the performance was not improved by the 3.2 update.\n\nStill no easy way to print webpages or emails.  Not fond of Google cloud print."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Alright, I've had my tablet for about five days and I've used it extensively in that time. With the recent demise of my laptop (primary computer) I've done all of my computer related tasks on the Transformer with the exception of my school work which is just too much for a small touch screen. With that said, let's jump into the review.\n\nI ordered my tablet through Best Buy on a Saturday and they had it at my house on Wednesday. This is light years better than B&H who, after placing my order on the 2nd of may still hadn't received the tablet from the manufacturer on the 21st when I placed my order with Best Buy.\n\nThe first day I had it, I didn't get to play with it much between work and things that I needed to do around the house. I was able to power it on, update it, pull all of my apps (purchased for my Samsung Vibrant) from Google, and let it charge for a few hours before I had the opportunity to sit with it and play with it. Even that was short lived because I opted to install the Skinomi screen protector so I didn't play with it much after the install because I wanted it to set right. My first impressions were exactly as I had expected based off my hands on with the Motorola Xoom at my local Staples the month before. Now that I've had more time with it, here are my thoughts on the Asus Transformer:\n\nBuild: The build quality of the tablet is awesome. Though the back is plastic it doesn't feel cheap or fragile. I prefer the way it feels to the Motorola Xoom and the iPad. The tablet feels solid and I haven't had any issues with the creaking that a lot of people have reported. The weight seems pretty evenly distributed through the body of the tablet which makes handling it easier than if one side was heavier than the other. The weight is a good weight for the size of the product and I think this adds to the overall solid feel the tablet has. Any lighter and it might feel cheap. Any heavier however, and it would be near impossible to use for any extended amount of time.\n\nScreen: The screen is superb! This should come as no surprise given the specs of the IPS screen. The screen is made of Gorilla Glass which is supposed to be scratch resistant but given that it is only scratch resistant and not scratch proof (my Samsung Vibrant's Gorilla Glass screen can testify to this) I installed a Skinomi screen protector. This was the first time I've installed a one and it came out looking good save a few pieces of dust that got trapped under the skin. It didn't really affect the quality of the screen any but when the screen is turned off you can tell it's there. Sure, it's not as pretty but it looks better than having a screen scratched to hell. I haven't tried any 1080p HD videos on the tablet yet but the few 720p videos I've watched on there seem great. I've not had any of the issues with choppy play back that some have reported with HD videos but that may be because I'm not watching 1080p videos. Either way, it doesn't bother me because the slight increase in quality from 720p to 1080p does not justify the large increase in file size for me so I will probably not ever watch a full HD video on my device (unless I can figure out how to copy Avatar from my Vibrant).\n\nInterface/Touch Response: The interface is not much different than any other Honeycomb tablet and not significantly unlike previous builds of Android. Google did a lot to make it more tablet friendly but if you've used any recent version of Android (particularly Froyo or newer) the learning curve is minimal. The device is very responsive to the touch. Just flipping back and forth between the home screens is effortless. There are times when scrolling on some websites can be a bit laggy or choppy but this is not Honeycomb per se but issues with the way the browser renders Javascript and even flash content. This can be disabled but really it's so minimal and infrequent that I prefer to leave it all on. There have also been a couple of times when I've touched a link or an app icon and had to repeat the touch once or twice to get it to recognize the action. I've also noticed in some apps it can be real particular about where you touch in a text bar before it will recognize the action and bring up the keyboard. To be fair, this is a problem that I have experienced in Netflix which is still not working properly on Honeycomb or most other Android devices. Overall, the interface could use a little work but it functions smooth and is quite responsive.\n\nApps: This is a well known issue to anyone in the Android world and Google and other developers are working on it. The application pool for tablets is small. However, most Android apps will run on Honeycomb with no real problems. Of all of the applications I had on my phone I think I've only found three or four that either won't work at all or will run but are not able to interact with the tablet hardware appropriately. For example one of the games, TurboFly 3D, will run with no problems but the controls are reversed (i.e. tilt the tablet right and the ship goes left) and there is no way to calibrate the controls. For me, the main uses for my tablet, aside from email and internet, are news and RSS feeds. News360 and Pulse respectively, these needs are met so the handful of quirky applications is not a big deal to me. The included office software does what it's designed to do and other productivity apps like Evernote work without issues. To top it off the Nook app for tablets includes magazine subscriptions so I have a few of my subscriptions (Maxim, Discover, and Guitar World. Waiting on Revolver, Draft, and Decible) coming straight to tablet and I can also shop the Nook store for books. For me, most of my needs are met so the lack of apps doesn't bother me too much but I also couldn't hurt to have more available.\n\nSpeakers/Sound: This is the only gripe I have with the Transformer to this point. For some reason the right speaker is significantly louder than the left. Using MoboPlayer which allows you to turn off left and right channels I was able to confirm that the left speaker works but it's just quiet compared to the right one. I've done some looking online and read that it's a software issue related to the SRS configuration, Asus is aware of it and working on a software fix for it. I don't know if this is true or not (internet gossip) but considering how often I actually use the speakers in favor of headphones or external speakers, how long it took me to get my hands on one, and the still limited supply, I'm going to hold off on returning the device to anyone for now. Like I said, if you connect external sound (headphones, etc) there is no sound issue so I'm not worried too terribly much. It's more of an \"I didn't pay $400 for an imbalanced speaker setup\" than anything else. If it is software, hopefully we'll see a fix soon.\n\nBrowser: The stock browser is, hands down, the best android browser. Better than Firefox, Opera, Skyfire, Dolphin... name it and this browser is better. In addition to flash capabilities, the browser can load full, desktop web pages instead of mobile ones. Yes it takes longer to load pages but I prefer full web pages, not pathetic, text only shells of web pages. I also like the ability to play Youtube videos in the browser. This is particularly useful if a website has embedded a Youtube video into an article... you can play the video without having to leave the browser and load another external application. The browser also has the ability to be loaded in full screen which give you a pop out selection of buttons when the edge of the screen is touched giving you access to your back and forward buttons, bookmarks, settings, and a few other buttons instead of taking up room across the top of the screen. It is difficult to explain how important screen space is when you're on a ten inch screen but I can assure you that removing the navigation bar at the top of the page makes a world of difference in the browsing experience.\n\nAccessories: At the time of this writing, there are only two accessories on the market in North America for the Transformer: The very cool keyboard dock that effectively turns the Transformer into an Android powered netbook and the sleeve/portfolio that doubles as a stand. I don't have the keyboard and I don't know that I will buy it. It's a really neat concept and the novelty factor is definitely in play here but I just don't think it would get enough use aside from showing it off to my friends and co-workers to justify spending the extra $150. I may pick it up once Asus has released its latest and greatest in another year and it's on the discount rack for $80 but for now I'll pass.\n\nAt the risk of breaking into a full fledge review for the sleeve let me digress from the actual review because I think accessories can make or break a product. Look at the iPod despite the vastly superior Microsoft Zune for example. Anyway, as a case, the sleeve functions well enough. The Transformer fits snug. The cameras are unobstructed, as it the volume rocker, headphone jack, mini HDMI, and power button. For some reason, Asus decided to cover the MicroSD slot. This may not be an issue for some people because a lot of people will fill their card with whatever , slap it in the tablet, and forget it's there. People like me, who are constantly rotating what's on my card might get annoyed at having to remove the tablet to get at the MSD slot. There have also been a couple of times that I have accidentally stopped the card, had to remove the tablet, remove the card, put the card back in, and put the tablet back in the sleeve. It's just a hassle.\n\nThe other issue is the design of the case. If you're given the case and hold it with the Asus logo right side up and open it, your tablet is upside down. Again, not a big deal, but it is annoying as all hell. Once you secure the flap to use it as a stand the sleeve can be used to put the tablet in two positions: standing up at a slight angle like a computer monitor or laying down so that it is angled toward you for typing. The problem arises when using it in the laying down position which requires you to flip the tablet upside down which wouldn't be an issue except for the fact that now your volume buttons are upside down, the Asus logo on the tablet is upside down, and most importantly, not all applications support full rotation.\n\nAdditionally, the case is nothing more than a front and back piece that were glued together so the edge sticks out and can make holding the tablet in your hand a bit uncomfortable. Additionally, I don't know what material this is made out of but this thing attracts dirt, pet hair, and everything else making it more of a hassle to clean than the screen. Also, the flap that covers the screen is not padded so it provides almost no protection for the screen at all. In all, the sleeve was not thought out at all and seems to have been more of an afterthought than anything else. Asus is laughing at all of us who gave them $40 for it. I would like to see something more along the lines of Motorola Xoom's case.\n\nAll in all, the Transformer is a great device. I can't compare it to the iPad or the Xoom because I've not had any real hands on with either aside from messing with display models. I can say that it's cheaper than both and that the tablet has been worth $400. If mine broke right now, I would shell out another $400 for a new one without a moment's hesitation. It has met and exceeded all of my expectations. Now I'm just sitting here, waiting for the 3.1 update notification from Asus."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "My Asus Transformer had a faulty touch screen right out of the box. I called Asus support and was sent to the wrong department 4 times, hung up on 3 times, and ended up having somebody from a different department issue the RMA. They told me I would have to pay to ship back their faulty product, which is totally unacceptable.\n\nAsus used to have excellent customer support. They've cross-shipped me things for free multiple times and never ever asked me to pay for shipping on a faulty product. I don't know what has happened over at Asus but I do know that I will no longer be recommending them to anybody for any reason. I have lost all of my faith in Asus as a company.\n\nI urge anyone who has had a similar experience to speak up at let Asus know that it's NOT OK to treat customers like this and it's NOT OK to put out a shoddy product to try and keep up with demand."}

I have really enjoyed using it.  I love the touchscreen interface even with the occasional lag.  I think Honeycomb is a terrific OS for tabs and I am willing to wait for updates and for developers to increase the app offerings.  Connecting to my wi-fi network was a snap.  Being able to get up and running just by logging into my Google account is a huge advantage.\n\nAsus put a lot of thought into the design of this tab.  The price, even with the dock, is such an excellent value and the extra battery life and ports that come with the keyboard dock really set Asus apart from the \"me too\" tabs that are out now and are yet to come.\n\nApple's ipad2 is seductive,  I'll grant you that.  The Acer Iconia is also a good choice.  For me, however, the Asus Transformer was a \"must have .\""}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Everything I hoped for. Intuitive, useful, lightweight, fabulous screen, responsive, inexpensive. I have read almost all the online blogs and tablet reviews for the last 12 months. I was tempted by the Adam tablet but I declined purchasing it because of my perception of quality control and support. Asus is the inventer of the netbook category and has excellent support. If called, they answer the phone. This issue, in fact, turned me off Motorola`s Xoom. Also, the transformer seemed to come to market as a mature device with a mature operating system. Android 3.1 should be available about two days. This update will prompt me for permission to install.\nNo user guide is included and none needed. I believe a guide can be downloaded from the Asus website.\n\nI can`t put this unit down - it is so much fun. I don`t care for my wife's ipad - but that is just my preference. I downloaded two news readers, my broker's online application and flixster. Also google docs. The Economist magazine should be availabe shortly. Google reader, calendar and news work as it does on the PC.\n\nI don't play games so go elsewhere for an opinion. I decided not to purchase the Asus keyboard yet since typing is a breeze with predictive word choices to complete my text. Battery should last more than eight hours. ASUS ADVISES fully charging unit for 8 hours or longer for the first few times unit is recharged. This improves battery life. The transformer charges with an included wall jack - which comes as two pieces that snap together and a usb cord to connects the transormer to the charger."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "After playing around with my new Transformer for the last 48 hours, here is what I have come to find out about it...\n\nPositives:\n\n+ The screen is gorgeous.  Assuming you don't get a defective unit with dead pixels and a lot of light bleed, you will be very happy with the screen.  Amazing viewing angles and rich colors are the two most notable characteristics.  Hands down, the Transformer has the best screen on the market right now, and that includes the IPad2, with its inferior dimensions and resolution.\n\n+ The battery life is pretty good.  I can't compare it to anything else on the market because this is the only tablet I've used from a full charge to nearly empty, but I can't complain.  I picked it last night at 9:30pm and played Super Nintendo roms on it until 4:30am without stop, until it flashed a 'low battery' warning on the screen telling me it was down to 4%.  At that point I put it on the charger and called it a night.  Running emulators is a significant drain on batteries that 7 hours didn't seem too short a time for me.  Under normal usage I could easily see my Transformer hitting 9 hours or more.\n\n+ The build quality, from what I am reading on two different and very dedicated Transformer forums, is decidedly hit or miss.  The majority of people are having no problems, while a vocal minority is having issues with creakiness and rattling.  As for me, I love my Transformer and am not having any build quality issues.  It doesn't flex, creak, or rattle.  While it does have a sort of hollow, plastic feel to it, the rigidity of the unit doesn't feel compromised.  It feels solid and balanced in the hands, and the rough texture pattern they used on the back seems to prevent scratching just as well as it provides grip while in the hands.\n\n+ Honeycomb operating system is quite nifty.  Before using it, I read a lot about it being geared more toward tech savvy people who like to tinker with things, but that's not necessarily true.  An idiot could use and customize Honeycomb.  Seriously.  Honeycomb is new and is going through some normal teething issues, so you will run into some force closes and other minor issues, but it's not that bad or disruptive.  Every force close I've had so far has been quickly remedied by restarting the program, and that takes all of about five seconds.\n\n+ Price.  The bang for the buck with Transformer is off-the-charts.  I bought the more expensive 32GB version and still feel like I stole it.  It does so many things and is so much more convenient than my slow, annoying laptop.  I honestly believe Asus could have priced each version a hundred dollars higher and still had a hit with the Transformer.  It's that good.\n\n+ Google Earth on the Transformer is..  simply...  awesome.  It's like digital crack.  I can't stop playing with it once I start!  If you love travel, geography, cartography, and just seeing the world from a bird's eye view, you have to download Google Earth to your Transformer.  Even with 3D buildings turned on, it runs pretty smoothly and loads up entire cities in just seconds.  Words don't do any justice to just how cool this app is.\n\n+ Gaming on the Transformer is outstanding and is only going to get better.  Some of the games this platform can run with the Tegra 2 processor are jaw-dropping.  Downloading and using the classic system emulators (NES, SNES, Gameboy Advance, PS1) adds so much value to the Transformer.  I've only had my unit for two days and I'm already up to my neck in great games, and most all of them were free.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Sharp edges.  Yes, sharp edges.  Don't laugh.  After holding this thing in your hands for a couple of hours, especially if you are playing games or texting frequently, you will definitely feel it.  It's not a deal breaker or anything, it was just a poor design decision on the part of the product engineers at Asus.  And when I say \"sharp\", I don't mean \"knife-sharp\", I mean \"teaspoon-sharp\", or \"not conducive to holding tightly in your hands for prolonged periods of time-sharp\".\n\n- Relatively weak app store at the moment.  Look, if you must have a bottomless well of apps to choose from RIGHT NOW, the Transformer isn't for you.  Apps optimized for Honeycomb are in short supply.  I have no doubt in my mind this will be rectified in the coming months, but right now the options are thin.  On this point, the IPad2 throttles the Transformer.\n\n- The included-in-the-box proprietary charging/USB cable.  Really, Asus?  I mean, really?!?!  It's about three feet long, which makes it almost useless when you need to charge it!  Whoever it was at Asus that made this decision (probably the same genius who insisted on hard, sharp edges) needs to be taken out and flogged.  Asus, if you are reading this, give us a six-foot cable, not three.\n\n- The speakers on the Transformer are underwhelming.  While I appreciate the fact that they are front-firing speakers, they just don't sound very good at all.  The sound they produce is a bit tinny.  If you are planning on using the Transformer as a full-time multimedia device, I highly recommend some decent cans.\n\n- The lack of Transformer-specific accessories on the market is surprising, and not in a good way.  Good luck trying to find the Asus keyboard dock, working car chargers, extra cables, and cases.  As of right now, late May, the options are Slim and none, and Slim has been sold out nearly everywhere I've checked.\n\nI hope this helps you tablet shoppers out there.\n\nEdit 1:  I found out that the short charging cable problem can somewhat be solved by buying a separate USB 3.0 female to male extension cable.  This will make the pathetically short Asus Transformer charging cable longer.  Since I don't have one yet, I am instead currently using a basic electrical outlet extension cable.  That way I can still use the Transformer from the comfort of my couch while it is charging.\n\nEdit 2:  I also found out about a free app in the Android market called \"Quick Settings\" that allows my Virgin Mobile LG Optimus V phone (unlimited $25 data plan) to act as a wifi hotspot for my Transformer.  This is AWESOME and adds so much mobile functionality!  I can now take my Transformer wherever I go and get internet access through my phone.  So if you are in the market for a phone and a tablet, this is the undisputed, bang-for-the-buck pair to get.\n\nEdit 3:  Just found an available Transformer keyboard dock and ordered it along with a 32 GB microSDHC memory card.  Will update this review when they arrive.\n\nEdit 4:  OK, I have the keyboard dock and have been playing around with it for a few days and my recommendation for the majority of prospective shoppers is to SKIP IT.  Unless you absolutely need the USB ports, keyboard capability, or extra battery life, this thing isn't a must-have by any measure.  I am going to guess that most people will use their Transformers for apps, games, casual web browsing, multimedia, and basic communication, none of which require the keyboard or extra battery juice.  The regular battery in the Transformer will last a solid nine hours - and maybe even more - if you don't have the screen brightness jacked up all the way and aren't running graphics-intensive games all day.\n\nOnly buy the keyboard if you don't have access to another computer, need it for work/productivity purposes, need the USB ports, and will be more mobile with the Transformer than normal, and away from charging sources for long periods of time.  The best bang-for-the-buck buy here is the 16GB Transformer without any overpriced Asus accessories.\n\nEdit 5:  If you are looking for a working, large-capacity microSDHC memory card, the 32GB Patriot Signature class 4 plays very nicely with the Transformer.  It comes in retail packaging with a nice case and SD card adapter.  It's a little more expensive than other 32GB options, but it's Patriot quality and speedy enough for large file transfers that it won't drive you nuts.\n\nEdit 6:  Because I've been on my Transformer for many hours per day since I purchased it, I've had a little bit of time to work my way through the app market.  Here are some quality titles I recommend...\n\nFor music:  PlayerPro is currently the best music app available.  It puts the stock music player included with the Transformer to shame.  If you are planning to put a lot of music on your Transformer, this is the player to use, organize, and interface with it.\n\nFor video:  I'm not real ecstatic with any of the options available, but MoboPlayer seems to be the pick of the litter at the moment.\n\nFor games:  There are so many more options than I was expecting.  Here are a few that really shine on the Transformer or are just great time-wasters in general...\n\nBattleheart - This is a total gem and plays like a champ.\nRadiant HD -  Beautiful neon graphics, 80s nostalgia, funny story.\nAngry Birds Rio - A great all-around game.\nAirAttack HD - Not a lot of depth but amazing visuals.  Casual game.\nGRave Defense HD - Challenging at higher levels.  High-quality game.\nGem Miner - I sunk four hours into this without even realizing it.\nGame Dev Story - Well worth the price of admission.  Entertaining.\nSuper Dynamite Fishing - Hilarious game.  Never knew blowing up seafood could be so fun."}

The catch is that we would have to pay for shipping and handling to get something repaired that didn't work right out of the box!  That is insane.  Completely insane.  It turned me completely off of the company.  We are returning the tablet and will wait for an android tablet from a company who has good customer service.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "For a couple of weeks I eagerly checked every retailer that was selling the device until I finally managed to grab one. At first I was impressed with the build quality and even the software.\n\nAfter a couple of days, I decided to buy my first Honeycomb-only app from the Market. I was unable to do so.\n\nAs it turns out, while my Nexus S and G2 are able to purchase anything on the Market, my Honeycomb tablet was unable to do so. The problem is that Android's Market has locked Puerto Rico out. My phones work because I use a U.S carrier (T-mobile) and the devices are assigned U.S. IP addresses. I opened up an issue with Google which, while starred by other users, has been ignore by the Google dev team.\n\nSo I ended up with a device that doesn't support my country, even though my country is a U.S. territory.\n\nHardware:\n\nI was quite pleased with the build quality and hardware for about a week (enough let the Market issue slip), but then a whole line of dead pixels appeared on the screen. A line that went through the whole screen, from left to right.\n\nI ended up returning my tablet. It's a great device, but it is unfortunate that Google has chosen to discriminate against my location, rendering the device essentially useless.\n\nI like Honeycomb and support open source projects like Android, but I see no use in keeping a tablet when I cannot exploit the -- somewhat limited -- Market's potential."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "QUALITY: I've had my Transformer for a week now, used it daily, and am finding more to like about it all the time. HOWEVER, every piece of this thing seems to be prone to failure according to the accounts of others, including the charging adapter. I knew the build quality was less than optimal before I bought it (plastic back, wonky speakers, screen bezel alignment), but I figured handling with care would be good enough to keep it running for a couple years. Now I'm finding out Asus recommends you don't leave the charger plugged in for more than a few hours unless you want to brick the whole unit? Too high maintenance.\n\nSo, I've had no problems with failure yet, but I am very apprehensive. I'm sure not going to throw the box away until the 1 year warranty has passed.\n\nDESIGN: It has a weird 1970's aesthetic with copper and brown tones. The aluminum looks nice but has sharp edges that can be a bit uncomfortable. The speakers on my unit are really nice, but the placement is poor; your palms are covering them in upright landscape mode. Camera and port placement are good. The IPS display is really beautiful.\n\nOS, SOFTWARE & ASUS MODIFICATIONS TO HONEYCOMB: The default weather and date widgets are great (one annoyance is that it always shows sunshine, even at night--all weather widgets I've used on my EVO show a moon after dark). The file browser is superb. I haven't tried Polaris Office yet. Google talk works better than expected for video chat (about as well as Skype on my laptop). The Asus keyboard doesn't seem any better than the default Honeycomb keyboard to me; I think they both suck. I downloaded a split keyboard from the market, which should be an obvious default keyboard option for such a large tablet. The web browser is just okay until you enable quick controls and ditch the default keyboard--then it's awesome.\n\nOTHER NOTES: Connecting a Wii remote for emulator play is very easy, but I already knew this from other reviews. What I didn't know is that the Classic Controller is also supported, which makes playing SNES and PSX games a console quality experience. I also tried a .apk for Netflix, which sadly didn't work even after some light tweaking. The release of Netflix for my EVO increased my love for that device by about 30%, and I expect a similar boost when it launches for Tegra 2 tabs...assuming mine lasts that long without bonking."}

I love showing people it with it docked then taking off the tab and handing it to them.  Most people say \"Nice!\".  I think its funny how apple fans the first thing they say when they see it with the dock is \"The iPad has that to!\" defensively.  WHOA! Why so defensive.  Do you feel inadequate all of a sudden?\nAt one point I wanted a netbook and then a tablet.  This pretty much nailed it."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I use my original iPad mostly as a portable Internet radio, and also to watch on-demand investment programming from CNBC, as well as some news programming.  The sound from the iPad's single speaker has always been quite natural, and with the TuneIn app it makes an excellent radio.  Unfortunately the sound quality from the Asus Transformer pad's speakers is definitely not of the same standard:  I find it hollow and higher pitched, and notice a sort of hissing when the \"S\" sound is pronounced.  And there's no tonal adjustment.  Also, as others have noticed, the sound is coming from only the right speaker, and there's no balance adjustment either.\n\nAnother huge disappointment is that it cannot understand my voice searches and commands, so either the internal microphone in mine is bad, or they're all that way.  I've read many reviews, and no one else has referred to how well the speech recognition works.  One of the things I like most about Android--and one of the biggest missing features in the Apple products in my view--is the ability to dictate text and issue voice commands and searches.  Google's speech recognition is generally very good, and it works well for me on my Nexus One phone, and also on the iPad when I use Google's search app there.  But the Asus pad doesn't know what I'm saying, and usually just produces a list of irrelevant options to select from.\n\nAs far as build quality I've noticed this:  Where the glass meets the brown metallic border in the top left, alongside the volume control, there's actually a narrow gap at least half an inch in length; I can sink the corner of a post-it note down into the gap, so that's not very reassuring.\n\nOn the bright side when I hooked the pad up to an HDTV and looked around using Google Earth it was an excellent experience.  It was very fast and responsive, and much better than I've experienced on a desktop computer.  The pad is generally very responsive, and does recharge quickly:  I believe it took about 2 hours and 45 minutes to get to 100% after I'd run the battery down to zero, which is probably about twice as fast as the original iPad's recharging rate.\n\nSo after all this research and daily checks to see where I could buy one, I'm probably going to return the Asus pad to Walmart.  It's a shame, but I also have to fault Asus for announcing an April 26th release date with a nearly zero supply.  Since then I've spent way too much time researching this product, attempting to buy it, then testing it.  When I bought my original iPad, it was easy, and following some initial iTunes connection problems, it has worked fine and been reliable.  That's the way the experience should be.\n\nToshiba and Samsung have Android pads due very soon, and there's been speculation that Amazon will have its own too, possibly with a quad core CPU.  I'll be looking into those options....\n\nFOLLOW-UP, 5/26/11:  I've listed problems with the speakers, the internal microphone and the build quality, and given credit for fast recharging, overall speed and video mirroring, yet most of the folks clicking on the helpful-or-not buttons think this is unhelpful.  It makes me question how authentic the responses to critical reviews are--after all, a lot of business is at stake."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I have all of these. If price was not an issue i would rate them in this order from best to worst\n\nXoom, best feel, best all around quality,screen is beautiful, resolution is fantastic, camera is the best, video quality is the best of all of them, battery is on par with the playbook about 9 to 10 hours, size if great, the speed might be a tad slower than the Acer or the transformer, but its not easily noticeable, button placement is great.  Whats not so great is my computer didn't easily recognize it, and the user interface to transfer pictures from my computer to the xoom WAS NOT EASY. But if price was not a factor, the Xoom would be my first choice. btw, all cords with this are just perfect nice length and quality.\n\nAsus Transformer, If price is an issue, than this is the one to get, ( if you can wait, lol. since its right now been on backorder twice, i lucked out and got mine at Best Buy during the day before it was sold out again.) Build quality is second to the Xoom, the screen is great but the Xoom edges it out just a tad, i think its a tad faster than the Xoom in browsing speed, the battery probably will last about the 7 to 8 hours as it says, size is great, good feel, all cords way to short, the cord and plug, or in laymans terms the brick gets pretty warm and from what i hear heat and electronics is not a good combo. When you plug in the adapter to the bottom of the transformer it feels kinda cheap, and i could pull it out rather easily.  This is a very good contender to the Xoom, Asus from what i understand makes its own parts for this. Let me add that this is much lighter or atleast has a lighter feel than the Xoom, and also that the Xoom is two hundred more than the transformer and as you can expect for two hundred less you get less, but i don't think two hundred less, perhaps in parts, but not in what it offers. one more thing, the video quality is definetely not as good as the Xoom, the Xoom's video quality is right up there next to the Playbook, which is excellent, when you hand the Xoom to someone and let them watch a video you took its like you were there watching it.  lol, one more thing this offeres that the others don't is a pre installed app. called my cloud, AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! lets you control your desktop or laptop remotely from your transformer, ideal for all you day traders out there like myself needing some time away from your desk for awhile while still keeping an eye on positions.\n\nAcer A500, physically bigger than the transformer, definetely more plastic which comes with more plastically feel, just as fast as the xoom, or transformer, you won't notice the difference in either of these.  has full size usb, but who cares lol, screen is not as nice as the transformer or xoom, battery from what i hear is just as good as the transformer, but not as good as the playbook or Xoom. Camera and video quality is not as good as the transformer, needless to say not even close to the Xoom and playbook.\n\nBlackberry Playbook, if this was a 10 inch model it would be my favorite, size kills it. multi-tasking is excellent as everyone says, video quality, screen quality, screen feel, user interface, battery life all are the best, along with its five hundred dollar price tag comes high quality. so far it is the most expensive 7 inch tablet, and it is worth it. if you want a 7inch tablet, price will be the only thing you will be able to complain about after you use this for awhile.  The feel is perfect, speed is not as fast as the transformer, or the xoom, or the A500 but faster than the galaxy, don't get me wrong its not slow, just not as fast.\n\nSamsung Galaxy, good tablet, screen is fine, play back videos is ok, battery like fine, browswing speed is ok, its nice, nothing to write home about.\n\nDell Streak this is the fastest one bar none atleast of the ones i compared.  picture quality is not so good id rate it a 3 or 4, video quality is not so good same rate a 3 or 4. it feels like a toy, looks like a toy, user interface is ok, the only standout is the raw speed, and that it excells at, if you wanna browse from page to page quickly than this is the one for you. but so far thats all its got. one more thing, battery life is 3 to 4 i think.\n\nAcer W500, SEND THIS THING BACK, slower than slow, basically a small laptop except for if you lift up the back plate you can see a mouse on a wheel. This thing has the newest AMD processor, and on this windows tablet, AND IT IS TERRIBLE. I have read that Windows is not user friendly on tablets, THIS ONE TIME YOU SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT OTHERS SAY, if you want to browse the internet on a tablet, PLAY UTUBE VIDEOS THAN DO NOT GET A WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM TABLET. you will not be browsing happily.  It seems like a good idea, but it is not..  Android or blackberry operating systems are the only way to go so far to browse on a tablet.\n\nhope this helps in your selection\n\nforgot to mention, xoom, asus transformer, acer A500 all have android honey comb 3.0\nAcer W500 is windows 7\ndell streak is i think android 2.2\ngalaxy is i think android 2.2\nplaybook has its own operating system\nps. get a good insurance plan from SQUARETRADE.COM, look for coupons on the internet and you will probably get up to 40% off.\nthats who i use and they are excellent, i would recomend them to anyone and everyone. my disclaimer is i don't work for squaretrade, or know of anyone who works there, iam merely a happy customer and will always be, because they answer phones 7 days a week 24hours a day, they do what they claim, and should you need to use your insurance plan for your item, you will be a happy customer."}

Supposedly worse than the Xoom's camera, but I really didn't notice the difference as I barely use cameras on either tablet - and wouldn't miss it at all if there weren't a camera - I suspect 99% of people feel the same way and don't know why anyone includes a camera - most cameras on phones are much better (and more convenient form factor).  Sound is weak but passable although the speakers are front mounted vs the Xoom's rear mounted speakers. It is \"stereo\", so still better than mono speaker on the ipad. On my recent flight to Kauai, slipped on my ear buds and the 6 hr flight zipped by while watching my favorite vids and reading my books - didn't have to connect to the keyboard dock for extra battery life.  Image was superb, although only certain video formats work properly (avi works best imo).\n\nForm factor is nice - slighter wider than the Xoom and a touch lighter, but \"feels\" much lighter as the weight is spread over larger area.  Also chamfered corners help, although I'd prefer completely rounded corners for extended holding.  Wider bezel gives place for thumbs to rest, compared to the Xoom which has narrow bezel and thumbs have little place to rest and occasionally touching the screen (not good in games or in busy websites with lots of links that can be accidentally activated, etc).  Back is quality textured plastic with a tasteful sparkle finish and feels solid - only the most anal would have an issue - most laptops are plastic.  Give me lighter and \"plastic\" vs \"strong\" and heavy any day.\n\nScreen is top notch. Bright, vibrant and good color saturation (noticeably better than the Xoom) - similar to the ipad, but with better 16:10 format screen which is better for video (and web browsing - I like wider rather than cramped).  Portrait is good for book reader and long documents. I use the Kindle app all the time, although Asus includes a decent book reader app.\n\nThe included software package is good - Polaris Office is a nice word processor and PDF reader - can view and edit MS files and PDF documents.  \"My Cloud\" syncs with your desktop and allows remote access.  Doesn't work perfectly with my 64bit Win 7 machine, but I've only used it once anyway.  OEM Music player is nice, although could use an equalizer built in (but can get the free Equalizer app that integrates and works just fine).\n\nCritics pan Honeycomb tablets because still only a limited number of apps optimized for Honeycomb (vs thousands for the ipad), but more come every day.  Personally, I have every app I'll ever need already - give me good media apps, good document programs, a few games and some nice widgets and I'm plenty happy. When I had my ipad, I could care less about 99.9% of the apps anyway - how many dozens of weather apps do you really need?  How many silly games?  The argument is a complete red herring to get attention away from the real problem with the ipad - the closed software and closed device (no SD cards, USB or HDMI ports)\n\nI also have the keyboard dock - got it mainly for the USB ports - a bit small for my large hands (I find many full size keyboards small). But the added battery is very nice, plus allows additional storage via full size SD card (in addition to mini SD card on the tablet itself). I thought it would dramatically speed my typing, but some of the aftermarket split screen keyboard apps (Thumb Keyboard by Beansoft is excellent) really speed typing on the virtual screen.  But keyboard is surprisingly good.  Nice chiclet style keys with good feel and lots of useful shortcut keys, plus touchpad.\n\nI also find that there are significantly fewer FC's (force closes for you non-techies) on the Transformer than what I experienced on the Xoom - don't know why, as the processor and Android software are supposedly identical.  I still average one FC or so a day, with heavy usage (I use it 12 hrs a day or more - from the time I wake up to go back to sleep).  Nevertheless, the Transformer has completely relegated my newer laptop to a dusty shelf - literally have not turned it on since I bought my first Android tablet (Xoom) at the end of February.  I can't imagine ever needing/wanting to use a laptop again - the sheer ease of \"instant on\" technology on an \"open\" Android device is fantastic.  No more interminable MS \"updates\" for balky/insecure software. No more \"closed\" Apple nonsense that is only closed to force you to use iTune$.\n\nThat said, Android isn't fully realized and is still being fleshed out.  Version 3.1 is due for release on the Transformer in June, so it's clear Google is still tweaking Honeycomb.  But the updates are painless - the tablet automatically notifies you and you choose when you want to update.\n\nOverall, the Transformer is an excellent device, especially considering the price.  It is \"the\" best tablet available, bar none.  And when you consider it is also the cheapest, it simply cannot be beat, particularly if you grab the dock and get the added utility of keyboard, additional battery, full size ports and additional storage (things you can't get on the Apple at any price - and never will - because they force you to use the Apple App Store/iTunes and pay thru the nose to add content).\n\nPersonally, even IF Apple offered a superior tablet (which they don't), I'd never buy another tablet from them again as I HATE being forced to use iTune$.  One ipad was enough to realize that you are an idiot to get locked in to a closed device.  But if you are a 4 year old, or a non-techie and don't know any better or care if you are being ripped off, I can see how/why the ipad is appealing - it is built for the clueless or the brain dead."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Let me start by saying that I'm a huge Android fan.  My phone is a rooted EVO 4G running a custom ROM.  It completely rocks.  I love open software, I love the widgets, I love Amazon cloud player, I love that Google syncs everything without ever plugging my phone in, I love that I can develop my own apps for free and distribute them as I see fit.\n\nSo naturally, I sat and watched the nowinstock website for two weeks to get my hands on the ASUS Transformer.  My wife has an iPad but I shun it's closed ecosystem and so waited excitedly for my first experience with an Android tablet.\n\nMy initial reaction to the UI was a huge disappointment.  The UI is scattered - the buttons are everywhere and various sizes.  Apps in the upper-right, home on the bottom left, Google search and voice in the upper-left, notifications and settings in the bottom right.  There is no uniformity - at different menus you have to perform different gestures to get things to happen.\n\nIn stark contrast, the Android phone OS (2.2 or 2.3) is clean and consistent - at least on my EVO 4G.\n\nThere were issues with the hardware, too:  the touchscreen is requires disturbing hard taps to register.  The right speaker outputs louder than the left.  The USB cable is short and proprietary.\n\nOk, so I was pretty underwhelmed by the device when it was working, but that's not the worst part.  I plugged it in to charge for the first time and that was the last time I ever saw the display on.\n\nNow it just won't turn on.  I hold the power button for >12 seconds multiple times, I can hear it clicking like it's starting, I can plug it in to my PC and see it mount as a USB storage device.  But the screen is toast.  So I start searching the web and find that people are having all sorts of problems with this product!\n\nBUYERS BEWARE!  At best the user experience is very rough.  At worst you'll have a very expensive paperweight.\n\nGoogle should be embarrassed of the state of Honeycomb.  While a child could figure out iOS, a seasoned Android lover can't get the hang of Honeycomb.\n\nASUS should be embarrassed for releasing a product with so many quality issues, and for limiting supply to make it look like a hot item.\n\nI guess I'll be waiting to see what 3.1 is like, but you can bet this time I'll try one out in the store before buying online."}

I love the color scheme as well, the screen is fantastic definitely on par with the ipad and better than anything i have seen, also its light weight and easy to hold. the screen is very responsive.\n2) honeycomb is awesome, they have alot of little touches in there from the screen animations to interactive widgets.\n3) the battery is also awesome i have been playing with non stop for about 8 hours now and its still about 40% from the orginal charge.  but please remember im not connected to the internet so i will update as well when i get to test it out.\n4) polaris office is awesome if you do alot of presentations for work like i do.  i actually found it easier to use than microsoft office and its completely compatible with ms office.\n5) i have read a few reviews that said it feels cheap and plastic and i was kinda worried about that, especially with the way they handle mail around here but although its not as sturdy as the ipad it is a very well made machine.\n\nso if you are looking a good honeycomb tablet that definitely worth every penny check out the asus tranformers its well worth it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I've had the iPad 1 for a while and have been looking for a solid Android tab to compete with it... well after nearly a month of waiting after the initial release, Amazon finally had the 32gb version. I've only had the eee Transformer for 2 days, but I can give my initial remarks. Hopefully I can update this as I use more features. I'd first like to say that I really dislike Apple and only own an iPad because my bro ordered one and wanted to sell it.\n\nMATERIAL: The material of the transformer is much worse than the iPad. While it doesn't look ugly, the screen is sticky and the back is plastic instead of the iPad's smooth metal. After a couple games and browsing around, I didn't notice the screen issue at all, however the hollowness sound of the plastic still bothers me. Don't get me wrong, the eee transformer has great parts- the screen, vid card, gps, and cameras are all a great value for the price. However the \"feel\" of the product is nothing amazing.\n\nMEMORY: MicroSD card functionality was real simple. I could play movies and view pics without installing any extra software and it was as intuitive as browsing windows explorer. I tested movies on it... it can play MP4 files but had a few problems with some short sample clips that would play fine on my computer. The quality was great but there was still some lag in the video. I think this is where the eeepad really wins over the iPad. The microSD hard is tough to get out if you don't have nails but there's a spring to help you.\n\nSOUND: In terms of sound quality, the iPad's speakers sounded nicer but the eee pad was definitely louder. I guess they come out at different angles so that might have affected my judgement; I'm no audiophile but eh they work.\n\nOS: Comment about the OS- I've never owned an iPod or a smartphone so I have no experience with either. However, iOS seemed MUCH smoother and much simpler to use. I'm sure there is a learning curve to honeycomb but I'm just stoked that they can't make the page flips as smooth as possible.\n\nAPPS: Yeah, honeycomb has no apps. I'd say don't be in a rush to buy it unless the only thing you want to do is show off to your friends. The iPad had a ton of games and apps and a music/video store, but I didn't like dropping cash for doing everything and plus 16GB is barely enough room for one TV show. The honeycomb store has no option to buy movies and barely any THD games. I want to spend money but there's nothing to buy! I guess the microsd function solves that... I have to say if they come out with an SNES app that can also let you hook up one or two USB retro controllers to the keyboard dock, I don't think I'd ever touch my iPad again.\n\nDISPLAY: The first thing I noticed about the eee pad's display was the width. It was a bit awkward for games/books (widescreen is weird) but definitely great for movies, which is what I bought it for. The IPS screen is definitely a plus but since I wasn't a part of the IPS hype I didn't really notice a difference staring right at it compared to the iPad. Viewing angles are definitely great. I played a few games that I also owned on the iPad (angry birds, glow hockey) and, let's be honest, my enjoyment of the game didn't really change. =) I haven't tested the miniHDMI but the fact that it's there is awesome in my book.\n\nCONNECTION: I connected easily to my router but when trying to view some youtube videos the speed was definitely slow for some reason. I moved and the connection was fine. Multitasking definitely makes browsing and downloading MUCH easier. Interesting thing to note, I hooked it up with my gmail acct and my picas albums appeared in my pictures automatically.\n\nOverall: I'd say the hype is a little high for this product, and it still has a long way to go. However, with the technology packaged with it and at this price it definitely has the potential to surpass the iPad 2. Don't be in a rush to buy it. Also, if you hate iTunes like I do then I definitely recommend this. No syncing, DRM crap, logging in to accts, etc... however, this product is definitely worth the price and maybe in a few months would have enough apps to be worth it. If you buy the iPad be ready to spend a couple hundred more on apps and content, whereas here you can still enjoy lots of apps and your own media for free. They are both quality products I guess, it just depends on how much money you have ready to spend. Oh iTunes sucks btw, did I mention that?"}

The open architecture of honeycomb combined with the power of this tablet make for a match made in heaven.\n\nWhat do you want your tablet to do? Play movies? check.  Flash sites? check.

I only use my laptop to transfer files to this thing.\n\nWhen you think of buying a tablet, why would you not want this?\n\nOne con: Honeycomb takes some getting used to, especially for me (coming from iphone and Apple.)  So, if you like to tweak and learn about technology a little bit, this is the thing for you.  If you're looking for simplicity, go with the flashless Ipad.\n\nps I have an original ipad, but I found it pretty much useless without flash.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I was one of the people that ordered on Amazon early morning on April 26th, hoping to get one right away.  Amazon notified me I would not get one until the end of May.  So I started searching other websites and ended up buying one from WalMart on May 5th, and cancelled my Amazon order.\n\nWhen the product arrived it immediately felt rather cheaply built.  There was terrible light bleed, and sound only came out of the right speaker.  I decided to live with this since the tablet was only $400.  Then after 12 days of use, the touch screen stopped responding to touch.  I called ASUS tech support, and we tried to troubleshoot on the phone, but finally came to the conclusion that my device needed a service tech to look at it.  They asked if I was alright with having an RMA issued and sending in the device, I had no problem with this at all.  They said they would would email me the details, and I received the email a few minutes later.\n\nAfter reading the email I realized it said that I had to pay for shipping the device to the service center for repairs.  I called back ASUS and told them I would not be paying anything out of pocket, and asked them to issue a shipping label.  They said their policy is to make the customer pay for shipping to the repair center.  I argued with them and said that was ridiculous considering I just bought a $400 device that does not work after less than two weeks.  I went up the support chain and was told by a support manager that there was nothing they could do, and I had to pay for shipping.  I told them I would be returning the device rather than paying for a two week old device to get repaired, based on principle alone.\n\nI ended up returning the TF101 back to WalMart for a full refund.  I was not actually concerned with the shipping costs, but it was more the principle of the whole issue.  I had just spent $400 on a tablet, and shouldn't have to pay anything out of pocket if it isn't working properly less than two weeks after purchase.\n\nThere is a reason the TF101 is the cheapest tablet on the market considering its specs.  It is horribly built, and the customer service at ASUS is a complete farce.  Be wise, and spend a little extra to get a quality tablet.  You can go onto (...) and check out the ASUS forum and read that there are many other people with the exact experience I had.  Feel free to ask me any questions...."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Okay, so my biases up front: Compared to most people buying this tablet, I might as well be half-Amish. I've got a cheap ol' pay-as-you-go cell phone that takes pictures and, I assume, can text but I've never used it for that, an old desktop computer, a Kindle, and until a week ago when it died, a 3 year old first-gen eee netbook. I haven't played around with smartphones or ipads other than a couple of times playing a tower defense game on an itouch, so despite having a pretty good ability at sorting tech things out (I use Ubuntu and that sort of thing) I've been comfortably behind the times when it comes to what gadgets can really do these days. If you're used to tablets you might not be as blown away by the transformer as I was, but if you're even a little bit behind the technological times this little device will leave you with your mouth hanging open in stark disbelief that you live in \"the future\" and that you're lucky enough to be able to afford something so feature-rich for 400 dollars (if you're lucky enough to find it in stock somewhere at retail price!).\n\nSo. Lots of well-informed and clever people have typed a whole lot of words that you've probably already read about what makes this tablet different from other devices on the market. There are also many good video reviews that you should search for before committing yourself to tracking one down. What I can offer in my review that I haven't noticed mentioned much elsewhere is just how intuitive I found the Honeycomb experience. It took a little bit of playing around with it, almost as if I had to train my brain to do things *intuitively* and trust my instincts instead of looking for the \"right\" way to do things, which is not how we are really used to relating to technology.\n\nI showed my 63-year old mother. Everyone has someone in their lives something like her. The type that is afraid to touch the keyboard for fear that it will break and she will end up with a virus that will delete the universe. The kind that calls you up saying \"ADOBE WANTS TO INSTALL SOMETHING IS THIS OKAY WHAT SHOULD I CLICK HELP HELP HACKERS\". and that sort of thing. She had it figured out in 5 minutes and was ooh-ing and ahhhh-ing over how simple and slick and user-friendly she found it. When I showed her that she could search the internet with her voice, I started to wonder if I would ever get to hold my precious new toy again. Even my just-turned-three \"big boy\" figured out how to get \"his\" game working on his own.\n\nIt's hard for me to imagine a better end-user experience, though I have yet to get my hands on the keyboard dock or try out any stylus program. As it stands now with my only uses being watching videos, listening to Pandora, playing some games, reading pdf papers, checking email/internet, and goofing around with some seriously fun applications, it already rates as my all-time favorite gadget. Once I've had a chance to use it with the dock and have the full experience of laptop plus tablet, I'll have to invent some new superlatives for my excitement. It feels a little weird to be living in the future, but I like it!\n\nEdited to add: My one complaint, if you can really call a tiny quibble a complaint, is the much-commented on fact that the charging cord is hilariously short. This is stupid and ASUS should have some people give them dirty looks until they change this on the next-gen transformer. There are workarounds if it really is an issue for you, but it's an idiotic design decision that flies in the face of common sense, especially when they have such a nicely designed product.\n\nSlightly later edit:\nWriting notes with a stylus (I grabbed a Boxwave) is smooth as silk and the camera and video functions work like a dream. I've noticed a little bit of bugginess from time to time resulting in a couple applications crashing; I am not sure if that is the fact of the applications or an issue with Honeycomb. Regardless, it happens very infrequently and hasn't caused me any headaches so far.\n\nEven later edit:\nI've been using it with the keyboard for a couple of days now and have fallen even more in love with it. It's hard for me to imagine ever going back to a standard laptop (or, for that matter, settling for a pad device without a fully functional keyboard for when I want to write long emails or documents. I really could not be more impressed with the design of this product and I know a couple of my friends have seen this baby in action and immediately started trying to hunt down Transformers of their own. The only other disappointments I have found in the interim are that the Android app store as some catching up to do for people using this device (but that will come with time and with more people using Android machines as their primary computers for work _and_ play) and the fact that for the unfortunate people with hardware issues ASUS is making them pay for one-way shipping for a product that is damaged right off the bat. Boo to them for that appalling policy. For someone that gets a fully working unit as I did, there's really very little to be upset about as any apps you could possibly hope for will be developed with time.\n\nOh, and finally, I've also started using this as a comic book reader and it is a total delight. I looooooove this machine!\n\nFINAL EDIT No really I mean it this time: We've been using our lovely little pad for a few months now and it's still the darling of our technology collection. We got Ubuntu up and dual-booting (don't try this if you don't know what you're doing) and I can safely say that it's the perfect machine for my family's needs. If you have the know-how I highly recommend rooting it and installing Ubuntu alongside Android so you can have a robust OS for times when you need to work and the fun tablet for when you just want something fun. If you are getting this as a second computer, you don't need to worry about rooting it but if you are really looking for something that can replace your desktop then you may want to think about dual booting."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I do not have a smartphone, I have an old desktop and a Lenovo Thinkpad x60s which has been on the brink of collapse for over a year. So what I wanted was something that would be functionally as useful as the laptop, but more \"usable\" with the touch interface. I also wanted something that would be better for taking notes and also functioned as an artist's pad for sketching landscape designs.\n\nI waited for Android Honeycomb to release before deciding between Apple's IOS (iPad) and the Android equivalents. I already knew from reading Xoom reviews that while Honeycomb was rough around the edges, it was a more sophisticated interface with widgets, live wallpapers, robust notification system and \"true\" multi-tasking. I have an iTouch, so I'm familiar with iOS and it is great for a simple device, but the tablets that are hitting the market now are full blown computers and the OS needs to reflect that. I briefly played with the Xoom and the iPad2 side by side, the iPad2 is definitely sexy, but I immediately liked Honeycomb better. So I waited for a more compelling price, and jumped when the Asus Transformer hit the market.\nIt was worth the wait!! I love this thing. I hardly pick up the laptop anymore, and the desktop had already been collecting dust for a while. So right now this is my primary computer for doing stuff at home: mainly emails, media, web browsing, sketching (AndCAD and SketchBook Mobile), note taking (Genial Writing Pro synced with Evernote). I use a bluetooth keyboard if I want to create documents using Polaris Office (ironically I found that Google Docs was pretty quirky when using the tablet). The form factor of the tablet is more like holding a book or a notebook than a computer. This is definitely computing at the human scale. Tablets have finally hit mainstream and I seriously doubt that they are going away any time soon. It is a pleasure to use.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful screen and resolution, retro stylish design, very responsive interface (with recent OTA updates), more mature Tablet OS (Android Honeycomb). Great price and quality! Gaming is also surprisingly fun on the large touch interface! Fruit Ninja and Samurai II kept me busy for hours. Asus has been quick to release firmware updates.\n\nCons:\nHARDWARE: Short charging/USB chord makes it hard to use while charging. Weight/Size: even though the tablet is fairly lightweight, my wrist does start to feel it after I have been holding it for an hour or two. I think this is also due to the width of the tablet as well. I prefer the 10.1 screen, so this only a minor complaint.\n\nSOFTWARE: The operating system is a major part of the tablet, and it is new so while I do not count it against the transformer itself, the biggest complaints that I have are OS related. Honeycomb is still in its fledgling stage, though getting better quickly: expect some crashes and quirks. Android Market on the android does not highlight Tablet specific apps like the web version, also if you run into a problem when purchasing an App it is NOT a fun experience to get any help on the issue. Google does not provide live support (at least I could not find any) and the App developers shrug their shoulders. So you have to figure things out on your own. For one app (LogMeIn Ignition) I had to cancel orders, re-order, uninstall, shut-down, re-install just to get the thing going. VERY ANNOYING!\n\nAll that said though, I still would go with Android over Apple IOS. I enjoy Honeycomb, quirks are minor and crashes are only occasional annyoances, most phone apps work great on the tablet, and I really appreciate the extra Android features and Android 3.1 just came out, so updates are coming on fast."}

Period.\n\nThe screen is gorgeous, the sound is surprisingly good, WiFi connectivity works just fine for me, it's responsive, front/rear cameras, competitively priced and the battery life is great.\n\nFor me, it was essential to buy this tablet with the optional keyboard/battery.  Not only does it act as a cover and seamless input device, but doubles the batter life! And is smart about it to boot, using the keyboard's battery before the tablet so the tablet will be charged as much as possible when undocked. The keyboard also contains two USB ports and an SD Card slot for extra expansion.  It's quick to dock and undock once you get over the initial worry that you are \"pushing too hard.\"  It requires some force to dock securely, but feels solid once docked.\n\nSo what's the bad?  No option for 3G at the moment.  The tablet without the optional keyboard only has a MicroSD card slot for expandability.  The tablet although responsive is not \"fast\", but you're not going to find any significantly faster options today.  Android 3.0 is good, but not as solid as Apple's iOS and there are not as many \"Apps\" available.  (But I expect both to improve rapidly.)  The tablet and keyboard are not \"all metal\" which is currently the fad.  Instead they have a metal edge, but textured plastic bronze/copper backing which I happen to think looks stunning, but others may disagree.\n\nCould not be more happy with this tablet and am looking forward to watching it get better with time as Asus, Google and developers improve on the already good, but far from perfect, software."}

I had an ipad2 but returned it because I felt like I couldn't do anything without paying for more apps and accessories.  You can't even do a simple export of a a doc to a sd card or hard drive on an ipad2 .  Maybe this the reason why APPLE continued to stay in a small closed nit system with their Apple fan goons while the rest of us  are on pc in an open system.  With this Asus Tablet, I can just copy music, movies, docs, in a sd card or portable hard drove or jump drive and the tablet reads it.  Asus got everything right.  Asus actually listen to their consumer and NOT money hungry by greed like other companies (XOOM, G-Slate, Playbook, Anaconia, Galaxy Tablet).  Asus offered an affordable, wifi tablet and first instead of an overpriced contract based tablet like other companies.  No wonder the other companies are not doing well.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "My last experience with Android was Froyo running from an SD card on an HTC HD2 phone. It was great fun, but far from smooth and fast. I sold the phone shortly after, but I'd already had a taste of what's to come. Finally Google decide to give us Android 3.0, aka Honeycomb, the optimized-for-tablet version. And oh boy, it's great. But this is a review for the tablet and not the software so I'll skip the Android-love rant. Just know that part of the Transformer's (TF) attractiveness is how well Honeycomb works.\n\nLet's start with the screen. Acer released their own 10.1\" Tegra2 tablet the same time Asus did and it was much easier to find, but I knew I had to wait for the Asus Transformer. Both screens are the same in size and resolution, but the TF's has the advantage of being an IPS screen. That means a wider viewing angle. Colors and contrasts don't wash out when you're not looking straight at the tablet. It's also a great capacitive touchscreen. Every touch registers as it should. And being a 10-point multi-touch screen, the possibilities are endless.\n\nThe build of the tablet is very good. I've heard of people complaining about squeaking and light-bleeds, but even the iPads have these problems and most won't even have/notice them. The speakers are in front, which is a great thing (cough*Xoom*cough). I also like the fact that Asus didn't go for a smooth (slippery) back and opted for a patterned textured cover. It feels great! No more wiping off fingerprints or having the thing slip out of your hands. The TF is very thin and light (not iPad2-calibre but close).\n\nThe few dislikes that I have. No USB port on the tablet itself (there is one on the dock). MicroSD slot instead of SD. Tegra2's limited decoding ability (no high-profile video files). Despite these flaws, I'm still very impressed with my first Honeycomb tablet. At $400, it's almost a steal :)"}

I have been debating between getting an iPad2,  Acer Iconia, and the Asus Transformer. I preferred the Transformer over an iPad  based on its flexibility to customize applications and access to the growing Android markets. Even though the hardware features are very similar between the Transformer and Acer Iconia,  the Transformer is thinner and has a much lighter feel . The capability to convert the tablet to a Android based netbook with upto 16 hours of usage is also a big plus.\n\n05/18/11 update\n\n- bought the Asus Transformer docking station from Frys Electronics. It works great as an Android netbook although the combined tablet/keyboard dock is a bit heavier than other popular netbooks out there. The 2 full sized USB ports on the dock are able to access document and videos from the USBs. Typing on the keyboard is also pretty good but not as sensitive as I was hoping for. It is a good deal, for less than $700, you get a nice 10.2 Android tablet which can also be used as a netbook that lasts upto 16 hours of play time.\n\nOverall feel and handling\n\nThe unit is pretty well built. As compared to the Acer Aconia which is about 3 oz heavier, the Transformer has a much lighter feel and easier to hold.  Everything including the Wifi works right out of the box. The only complain I have are the short 3 ft cable and proprietary docking connector which makes it hard to replace if it was lost or broken. The full user manual  is not included in the box but it can be downloaded from the Asus support site.\n\nOS and applications\n\nThe unit comes pre-loaded with the Android 3.0 OS. It is quite stable with a few occasional forced close on some of the applications. It also supports multitasking which allows us to do quite a few things in parallel. There are four screens which provide plenty of room for adding applications and widgets. It also has full access to the Android marker including the Slingplayer (remote viewer for home satellite DVRs) which is blocked  for other tablets such as Archos. What surprised me was the quality of the video being streamed to this unit with the SlingPlayer. It is much nicer than the other tablets and netbooks I have tried. The Transformer also comes with the Polaris Office which allows us to view/edit Microsoft excel, word, and powerpoint files.  The free daily paid Android apps from the Amazon Appstore makes it very tempting to load this gadget with lots of fun and useful apps.\n\nVideo and display\n\nThe display is very nice and sharp with the IPS panel and the ultra-wide 178' viewing angle. However, the glossy and finger-print attracting screen make adding an anti-glare screen protector highly desirable. The supported video format seems to be quite limited as it was not able to play all the video formats I tried (including some MPEG and flv files). The built-in  camera takes good pictures. However, the video recording is of average quality and it appears choppy in low lighting conditions.\n\nSound\n\nThe unit's speakers produce  pretty good quality sound but I would not call it superb\n\nBatteries\n\nLasts for a good 6-7 hours with a full charge. I would be quite happy if I were able to extend it to up to 16 hours with the docking station (still waiting for it to be available).\n\nOverall, I am very happy with this gadget. In my opinion, this is probably the best Android based tablet on the market from a price/functionality standpoint."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Wow,  from the moment I saw the Android Honeycomb, I knew it would smash the iPad2.  My daughter got the iPad2 and she is happy with it, I didn't fancy it.  I ran to the Xoom but felt it just didn't feel right with some functions still not working like the card reader.  Then cam the Eee Pad Transformer and the reviews showed it to be a real working Android Honeycomb device.  I bought one at a hiked up price on Amazon and didn't regret it.  My wife immediately took it and said she wants to sell her macbook and keep this device.  My teenage son did the same.  He ordered one and sold his Macbook.  Its fast, it has mini memory reader that works and an SD & USB slots (with the dock) and they work.  It has MyCloud that lets me do all the sync I want with my computer and it comes with a very powerful office suite that has a super powerful, friendly and fully functional Excel, Word and Powerpoint.  Softwares are plenty.  I used to have an iPad and bought many softwares that I never used because they don't have trials.  On the Eee pad transformer, the software are mostly free due to the powerful google advertising machine.  If the tine adds bother you, just pay a couple of bucks to have the pro versions without the tiny adds.\nMy entire family loves this product and find it to be not only a computer replacement unless you have custom built business softwares that must be used on a PC network, but a definite iPad2 killer in our opinion.  But if you do have to use your office based PC, then the Eee Pad Transformer also comes with\nMyCloud to remotely access and control any PC or Mac system and access applications or files to extend the versatility of the Eee Pad Transformer experience from anywhere.  Technology changes everyday and there will always be better devices with time, but today, the Eee Pad Transformer is the one to get with a 5 Star rating in each category of power, features, build, price, portability, functionality and Versatility."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I purchased the TF101-A1 and keyboard dock from other vendors for $399 and $129, respectively. The keyboard dock is a very nice chiclet style 92% keyboard similar to recent ASUS netbooks. I am still not famliar with all the Android quick keys, but appear to be useful. The trackpad is nice, but lacks multitouch. The tablet itself is extremely nice. The screen has vibrant colors, wide  viewing angles, and is very responsive. The screen rotation is fast, but sometimes a little touchy. Battery life is incredible, especially with extra battery in the dock. I am new to Android, but I am enjoying the Honeycomb experience. A more direct way of killing/stopping applications would be nice (i.e., other than downloading another app to do it). The market place is easy to use and navigate. The apps themselves are hit-and-miss. Some will not take up the full screen (optimized for phones), some only work in portrait mode, and some work fine initially but then have a messed up aspect ratio on subsequent launches. Using the back button rather than the home button to exit the app seems to eliminate this last issue. Apps that work extremely well are the browser, Skype, email, WinAmp (tested radio), Google Sky Map, Google Earth,  and navigation (although I had to kill the app to stop voice-to-text directions). I have observed forced closings, but only with downloaded apps which I subsequently remove. I downloaded QuickOffice, since I did not really like the look and feel of Polaris Office. I personally have not noticed much lag, although I did close the weather widget which some claim to be the cause of the lag. I also have had no problems docking the tablet, although I have not yet tried using a USB drive. I also have not fully explored the ASUS MyNet app, but it has already grabbed a few photos from one of my pc's via wifi syncing. Could be really handy. My biggest problem now is keeping it away from my teenage daughter. Once Hulu is available, I might have to buy another one. The ecosystem of the iPad may be easier to use and a little nicer, but the TF101-A1 is a better value and has more capabilities. The only complaint that I have thus far is the low quality of video taken by the backward facing camera. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. I had been waiting on the Notion Ink Adam tablet, but I m glad I waited.\n\nPros:  Incredible screen\n  responsiveness\n  smooth operation with  little or no noticeable lag\n  very long battery life\n  very nice on-screen keyboard, as well as very nice keyboard  on  dock\n  fast access to key applications such as market, email, and browser\n  great browsing experience\n  decent speakers\n\nMinor Cons:  tablet may be difficult to use outdoors due to glossy screen\n  picture quality not great and video capture quality is poor\n  my daughters would also include lack of Hulu\n\nEDIT: Two other minor cons are the 3 ft long charger and finger smudges (need to get nice clothe wipe). NEVER using anything else to access email again (except at work).\n\nFINAL UPDATE: Couple of other apps are rather impressive. The first is DoubleTwist AirSync (from market) which allows you to use your wifi router to sync the Transformer to a PC/Apple with an iTunes account. As long as one only sync's a couple of dozen songs, the process is rather fast. I personally prefer the look of the ASUS Music player, which has nice 3D graphics with album covers, but DoubleTwist does include internet radio. Another really nice app is the Google Books for Android app provided on the Transformer. We have 2 Kindles in our household, which are amazing. The one drawback is when one wants to search for a book from a site such as feedbooks.com. The book app on the Transformer is the exact opposite. With a touch of the screen, one jumps to an android book market which includes what appears to be hundreds of free classic books. Even over wifi, the books download within 15 seconds or so. One also has the option to store the book locally so you have access to the book offline. Add in easy book navigation AND cool page turning graphics and you have something that is far easier to use than the Kindle. The Kindle does have the E-Ink screen, though. I also paid for CoPilot GPS/Maps. Google maps works great, but not offline. With CoPilot, I am able to use the offline Transformer as a GPS with text-to-voice turn-by-turn directions. Worked flawleslly and appears to be accurate to within 1/4th of a block, which is the accuracy of the GPS. I should also point out that there has been 1-2 occasions where the Transformer locked up on me. I was able to power down by holding in the power button for a fairly long time. I believe I had too many apps running and ran out of RAM. Probably just growing pains as I become familiar with Android.\nADDED 5/27. I tried both a SD card and a USB flash drive and both worrked flawlessly. After playing around awhile I have concluded that Polaris Office is actually more capable than QuickOffice. Polaris handled technical Power Point files (with equations and figures) a lot better than QuickOffice. My initial response had more to do with the user interface. Neither appear to handle Open Office documents, at least not by default. Need to see if there is an android equivalent to Ghostscript (postscript viewer) and GnuPlot (nice plotter for data files). I've tried numerous browser (Opera, Dolphin, Firefox,..) but prefer the default. Seems to work well with all sites accept HotWheels (I have 5 yr old son) and some sites that require plug-ins that don't support Android (e.g., JumpStart). Other useful/cool apps are SoundHound (can identify song you hum), App Protector (keeps malware from changing tablet settings), and Google Body.\n6/1/11: Update to Android 3.1. Can purchase and play Movies from Google Marketplace via YouTube. Update did not include Video App for offline viewing though. That is supposed to come in a couple of weeks.\n7/16/11: Update: Google Video player included in latest update. Should now be able to rent movies and view them offline on the marketplace. Tablet is rather stable now. Super Task Killer is the only app that continues to have forced closes.\n3/14/12: Update: Initial upgrade to Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich resulted in at least 1 or 2 forced restarts per day (i.e., hold power button for 13 secs to force shutdown). Last update (3/12/12 I believe) appears to have fixed the issue. Tablet appears to be working better than ever."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I have the tablet for a week already. I have tried some apps and so far I am impressed.\n\n1. The design is gorgeous. The metal frame is sturdy enough and the knobs are metal too. The plastic back is solid. The device overall looks and feels luxurious.\n\n2. The screen is IPS, the viewing angels are perfect, i.e. 180 degree, colors are well saturated, etc etc. Screen response is fast.\n\n3. I haven't tested the full battery depletion, I have always used it heavily for 6-8 hours straight with active GPS, WiFi,Skype, games and/or movies, live wallpaper and some other background applications running, and it has been down to around 30%. It can last a day of usage, apparently, and then it can be charged at night when not in use. It charges for around 2 hours from zero to full.\n\n4. GPS works, it is as fast or faster as standalone GPS navigators /I have Magellan 3250/. I am using lucos free, and I haven't figure out yet how to properly download an US map, but eventually the offline GPS navigation shall work on this. Paid apps are less then $10 anyway.\n\n5. WiFi worked straight, it is not even worth commenting here. I am on WPA2 wifi N. It is fast.\n\n6. Installed flash 10.2 - I haven't bumped into anything that doesn't play yet. I browsed and read numerous web sites, most of them with heavy flash. I watch YouTube in the browser and within the app - both work, HD also works but it is limited by the WiFi throughput. That is not caused by the tablet. I am yet to see a device that passes smoothly HiDef video through WiFi.\nVevo works smoothly too. It has to be installed AFTER the flash 10.2 installation in order to work.\n\n7. Played several movies with Mobo player. Avi, DivX worked perfect - nothing to comment. I tried h264 mkv 720p main - it played smoothly, but I have no sound - I think it is Dolby coded though. I haven't had time to try another file. Given the limited storage capacity though, I will most likely use DivX files or h264 mkv lesser than 1GB each, so I can store more when travel. The 1080p discussion in the forums is kind of irrelevant - I don't need the tablet to be capable of playing 1080p when the file size is at least 6GB anyway. I will need that HiDef when the storage of tablets achieves 1TB :) at the same or lower tablets price.\n\n8. Kindle app works perfect and it is very easy. Amazon app store works perfect. Google Android Market - works perfect, easy to navigate and the icon was pre-installed anyway.\n\n9. The sound is stereo, it makes difference in videos and movies, and it is pretty loud. My daughter can and she is watching movies on the road, and plays Angry Birds :).\n\n10. Skype works - no video yet.\n\n11. It is visible immediately as \"Asus Transformer\" external storage in Windows 7 upon USB connection. It is visible in the WiFi network. DLNA works as it should be. In Win 7 Home Premium you right click on a media file and chose PLayTo Asus Transformer. For comparison DLNA doesn't work on my SONY DLNA certified TV :):)\n\nI haven't tried the remote terminal, i.e. the Splash application yet, since I haven't updated the tablet. It is stock 3.0.1.\n\nI have used iPad, iPad2 and this Asus. For a GPS unit you need iPad with 3G. The iPad build quality perception is better, since it is solid aluminum unibody. Anything else is on par. iTunes is a joke, I would never install that malware on a Windows computer again, never. So, the preference is highly subjective, but in the Android field this is the best right now. If you like iTunes, i.e. you feel more comfortable and easier to use - you will be better off with Apple. To me Apple OS is too restrictive and useless. I personally have much more practical application for this device since my usage (connectivity, applications, etc) is pretty much unrestricted by the OS. I use the tablet as a standalone computer, I don't need to sync it or connect it to a desktop to be functional."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Finally, a non iPad tablet that's both technologically on par (and here and there superior) with the 'leader' AND reasonably priced AND doesn't force us, the paying customers, into some 'ecosystem' mandatory straightjacket.\n\nWhile not perfect, the Transformer offers a great deal when it comes to features and expandability and it's the clear price leader at this time. And, of course, there's the open Honeycomb and the freedom that a reasonably open OS gives you without having to wait for jailer's okay - no need to jailbreak. You are free by default as you should be. I so wanted an open Wi-Fi tablet so maybe I am a little overenthusiastic but I totally jumped on this one when it became available because it's the first non-iTablet that actually makes sense IF you don't care about 3G/4G.\n\nI've only been using the Transformer for a couple of days and I haven't reached the top of the learning curve so I'm not going to write a lot about the various apps but I've had enough time to get to know the hardware part and basic capabilities and, for someone quite skeptical when it came to 'tablets' all I can say is that I am impressed, especially when comparing it with the other tablets out there. And this is why (I rated each feature on a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 is bad and 10 is best):\n\n-- PRICE (8) - the 16 GB model beats all the others at the time I'm writing this. This TF101-B1 comes with 32 GB and costs $100 more for an additional 16 GB - $499 list price - but it's still a good match for everything else that's out there. There is a separate listing for TF101-A1, the 16 GB version.\n-- DISPLAY SIZE (10) - 10.1\", 16x9 (wide screen). Can't really compare it with the iPad because iPad's 9.7\" screen is in a 4x3 format - more square inches but movies show much better on a 16x9 screen.\n-- RESOLUTION (10) - 1280x800 translates in 30% more pixels than iPad's and it's a beautiful, bright image. However, you can't really use it outside unless it's a cloudy day. For reading on the beach, there's the Kindle :)\n-- INTERNAL MEMORY (8) - 1 GB is not overwhelming but it's twice as much as iPad's (better multi-tasking) and on par with the more expensive Xoom.\n-- PROCESSOR (8) - 1GHz NVIDIA Tegra 2 (2 x Cortex A9) is on par with Xoom, clock speed similar with iPad 2.\n-- STORAGE (10) - 32 GB for this model, expandable through microSD to 64 GB. The 16 GB model may be the better value but you are limited to 48 GB.\n-- WEIGHT (7) - about 1.5 lbs., comparable with iPad's and Xoom's. It doesn't feel heavy to me.\n-- CAMERAS (7) - 5MP rear camera for picture or video-taking and a 1.2MP front facing for video chat. Quite happy so far but there is no flash.\n-- SPEAKERS (8) - 2 SRS on the sides so they won't be muffled if you lay it flat. I believe the iPad has only one.\n-- CHARGING (8) - via wall connector or USB but it took overnight to fully charge the tablet over USB - understandable because a tabled requires significantly more power than a phone. The dedicated port does it in a couple of hours.\n-- BATTERY LIFE (8) - I was able to do 7-8 hours on a full charge, not as good as iPad but close.\n-- PHYSICAL BUILT (7) - It's okay but the plastic on the back feels a little 'thin'.\n\nOther features/capabilities include HDMI port, Bluetooth, GPS, Flash (haven't installed the upgrade yet), remote control of Windows and Macs (it works).\n\nERGONOMICS\n\nThe Transformer is slightly heavier than the iPad but not significantly so. The 16x9 format is very good for movie viewing and, because it's wider, it makes for better integration with the dock expansion.\n\nI like the mostly glass front with a little metal on the edges but the plastic back is so-so. It's solid but you can squeeze it if you really try - it gives to pressure.\n\nThe screen is responsive to touch. I haven't been a heavy 'touch' user until the Transformer so I am not going to make any comparisons but I am pleased. The fine resolution  makes serious multitasking not only possible but also practical. The Transformer has more pixels than the iPad and it shows.\n\nTHE DOCK\n\nI must confess that even though I'm the current user, I bought the Transformer for one of my kids - because he did so well in school but he's getting it in a month or so on his birthday - and I decided to splurge a little, ordering the 'dock'. Hasn't arrived yet - back ordered - but someone I know has one and I was able to test-drive it for about one hour.\n\nI haven't used it extensively but, anyone who's used netbooks will immediately recognize one as soon as the Transformer plugs into the keyboard-plus expansion. Besides the physical keyboard which integrates well with the OS and adds lots of dedicated buttons, the dock has a built-in battery, 2 extra USB ports and a SD card port. My impression is that, once plugged into the dock, it charges the tablet and all power comes from the dock's battery for as long as the battery has power. As for how it feels... let me say that I'm a lot more comfortable with a full size keyboard.\n\nWhen docked you can actually fold the Transformer closed with the dock as the keyboard bottom and you end up with something that's hard to distinguish from a netbook, only it's running an Android OS.\n\nMY EXPERIENCE\n\nI am still getting myself used to a touch-driven OS and the built in apps and I didn't get a lot of third-party apps but not everything ran - tech support told me that not everything 'Android' will automatically run on Honeycomb so... try before you buy :) . However, whatever ran it did so without major problems. Except... playback was sometimes choppy when on full-screen mode but maybe it was so because I was running half a dozen other things at the same time.\n\nI should note that WiFi integration was flawless and, indeed, once on my local network, I was able not only to stream from media servers but to also open remote sessions on some of our Windows 7 and Windows Home Server machines.\n\nMY EVALUATION\n\nAfter a few days of use I am very happy with my purchase and I am considering a second for my other teen kid - but I may wait for the next great tablet because I don't expect the Transformer to stay the top non-Apple tablet forever. I wrote 'top tablet' because this is the best WiFi tablet deal you can get today.\n\nThe Transformer has a few minor issues: USB charging, the not-so-hard back, a little on the heavy side but the pluses overwhelm the 'issues' and the dock expansion is extremely innovative and it can even be a good 'transition' prop for those familiar with netbooks - but it does come at a price.\n\nI love my Transformer and Amazon's rating for 'I love it' is 5 stars.\n\n--\n>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<"}

There are though still some things about it that don't quite work too well. If you'r like me and enjoy the casual games such as bejewelled blitz, the game slows down and the graphics are jagged and aren't that great for a game that a system like this should handle. Not sure if that's just my tablet or if anyone else has the same experience. Also, video playback will stutter from time to time.

This has made it so the Tegra2 processor can use much more of its power and now HD videos are running much smoother!!!

I cannot put this down. My web surfing on my laptop has been completely replaced by this tablet. I have had NO random reboots, and only a few force closes of apps (Mainly the CNN app). Still going strong and the battery lasts all day long.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nTo start off, the build quality of this tablet is definitely fantastic. The textured backing is easy to grip and the textured outer metal frame is very sturdy and feels GREAT when being held. The volume rocker and power button are also metal and feel very sturdy when being pressed. The Transformer also comes with Corning Gorilla Glass, that is extremely scratch resistant, so it isn't entirely necessary to buy a screen protector! Some may not like that the backing is not metal, but I feel that the material ASUS used will stand up better to scratching.\n\n5/5 for Build Quality\n\nWhen turning on the tablet the first thing I noticed is how vibrant the colors are. This is because the Transformer comes with an IPS screen instead of a normal LCD screen, and the viewing angles are indeed better than a normal LCD. I compared the viewing angles to an Acer Iconia and iPad 2 and it beats the Acer and is on-par with the iPad 2. The capacitive screen is very very very responsive and accurate, so no complaints there. The only thing I have noticed is a slight light bleed that you can notice on some edges when on a pitch black background. In 90% of all situations, you wouldn't even know it was there so I am not to worried about it (I noticed this bleed on the iPad 2 as well, and it ONLY shows on black backgrounds). As stated before, the screen comes with Gorilla Glass so it is very scratch resistant.\n\n4.5/5 for Screen Quality\n\nThe Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) OS is very fun and intuitive. There are tons of apps, widgets, customizations, etc.. that make using this tablet enjoyable. The only problem is that there is only small amount of Tablet optimized apps as of now, but it seems like most apps work with the Tablet anyway. The Android App Market is definitely expanding, so this won't be an issue for long. I have had a few force closes (expected to be fixed with updates), and everything is very quick even with multiple apps open. Flash works great in the pre-loaded browser, and works even better in Dolphin Browser HD. Asus also made some tweaks to the look of Android, and added a few Widgets.\n\n4/5 for OS\n\nThe Transformer comes with a 5.0 Megapixel Camera on the back and a 1.3 Megapixel camera on the front. Both take pictures great, and the video recording is good, but could use some optimization (which should come in future updates).  The Mini-HDMI out works great! and the MicroSD card slot also reads/writes to the card very quickly. The headphone jack is like any other headphone jack and works fine. The speakers are mounted on the sides of the tablet and produce stereo sound that sounds great, but can crackle if turned up too high with certain music (Bass Heavy). Some notable cons are the lack of an LED on the back (Like the Acer Iconia) and a 1.3 Megapixel compared to the 2.0 Megapixel camera on the front of the Acer Iconia. The Asus also lacks Haptic Feedback that the Acer Iconia has.\n\n4/5 for the Extras\n\nThe price! $399 is a fantastic price for a tablet of this quality. I would definitely pick this up over the Iconia and iPad 2, even though it does lack some of the extras the Acer has it makes up for it with the IPS Screen and terrific build quality.\n\n5/5 for the Price\n\nI have no interest in the Dock, but from what I have seen/heard it is a great addition if you are looking for an ultraportable netbook/tablet combo. I would like to add that I also own an Acer Iconia (It is going back today) and that the Asus is slightly better in some ways compared to the Acer such as the screen and build quality. I am going to miss the Haptic Feedback and the LED however.\n\nTL;DR: This is the best Tablet for the price, and is just as great, if not better, than the iPad 2.\n\nThanks for reading my review, and good luck."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I own both iOS and Android devices, so I'm not biased either way, but I am extremely impressed with the Honeycomb OS and especially this tablet.  The build quality of this tablet is unbelievable for the price.  At $399, I thought there would be some compromises in build quality and functionality, but in my opinion, the build quality is equal to or better than tablets costing a lot more.  I compared this to the Xoom, Acer Iconia A500 and other Android tablets before making my decision and as much as I \"wanted\" to like those tablets, this was simply better.\n\nThe IPS screen and the keyboard dock were the two features that absolutely sold me, but even without those, I feel that this would still be the best tablet on the market."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "Finally, a non iPad tablet that's both technologically on par (and here and there superior) with the 'leader' AND reasonably priced AND doesn't force us, the paying customers, into some 'ecosystem' mandatory straightjacket.\n\nWhile not perfect, the Transformer offers a great deal when it comes to features and expandability and it's the clear price leader at this time. And, of course, there's the open Honeycomb and the freedom that a reasonably open OS gives you without having to wait for jailer's okay - no need to jailbreak. You are free by default as you should be. I so wanted an open Wi-Fi tablet so maybe I am a little overenthusiastic but I totally jumped on this one when it became available because it's the first non-iTablet that actually makes sense IF you don't care about 3G/4G.\n\nI've only been using the Transformer for a couple of days and I haven't reached the top of the learning curve so I'm not going to write a lot about the various apps but I've had enough time to get to know the hardware part and basic capabilities and, for someone quite skeptical when it came to 'tablets' all I can say is that I am impressed, especially when comparing it with the other tablets out there. And this is why:\n\n- Price - beats all the others at the time I'm writing this.\n- Display size - 10.1\", 16x9 (wide screen). Can't really compare it with the iPad because iPad's 9.7\" screen is in a 4x3 format - more square inches but movies show much better on a 16x9 screen.\n- Resolution - 1280x800 translates in 30% more pixels than iPad's and it's a beautiful, bright image. However, you can't really use it outside unless it's a cloudy day. For reading on the beach, there's the Kindle :)\n- Internal memory - 1 GB is twice as much than iPad's (better multi-tasking) and on par with the more expensive Xoom.\n- Processor - 1GHz NVIDIA Tegra 2 (2 x Cortex A9) is on par with Xoom, clock speed similar with iPad 2.\n- Storage - 16 GB, same as iPad 2 but Xoom comes with 32GB. Expandable through microSD.\n- Weight - about 1.5 lbs., comparable with iPad's and Xoom's\n- Cameras - 5MP rear camera for picture or video-taking and a 1.2MP front facing for video chat. Quite happy so far but there is no flash.\n- Speakers - 2 SRS on the sides so they won't be muffled if you lay it flat. I believe the iPad has only one.\n- Charging - via wall connector or USB but it took overnight to fully charge the tablet over USB - expected because tablets come with larger batteries. The dedicated port does it in a couple of hours.\n- Battery life - I was able to do 7-8 hours on a full charge, not as good as iPad but close.\n\nOther features/capabilities include Bluetooth, GPS, Flash (haven't installed the upgrade yet), remote control of Windows and Macs (it works).\n\nERGONOMICS\n\nThe Transformer is slightly heavier than the iPad but not significantly so. The 16x9 format is very good for movie viewing and, because it's wider, it makes for better integration with the dock expansion.\n\nI like the mostly glass front with a little metal on the edges but the plastic back is so-so. It's solid but you can squeeze it if you really try - it gives to pressure.\n\nThe screen is responsive to touch. I haven't been a heavy 'touch' user until the Transformer so I am not going to make any comparisons but I am pleased. The fine resolution  makes serious multitasking not only possible but also practical. The Transformer has more pixels than the iPad and it shows.\n\nTHE DOCK\n\nI must confess that even though I'm the current user, I bought the Transformer for one of my kids - because he did so well in school but he's getting it in a month or so on his birthday - and I decided to splurge a little, ordering the 'dock'. Hasn't arrived yet - back ordered - but someone I know has one and I was able to test-drive it for about one hour.\n\nI haven't used it extensively but, anyone who's used netbooks will immediately recognize one as soon as the Transformer plugs into the keyboard-plus expansion. Besides the physical keyboard which integrates well with the OS and adds lots of dedicated buttons, the dock has a built-in battery, 2 extra USB ports and a SD card port. My impression is that, once plugged into the dock, it charges the tablet and all power comes from the dock's battery for as long as the battery has power. As for how it feels... let me say that I'm a lot more comfortable with a full size keyboard..\n\nWhen docked you can actually fold the Transformer closed with the dock as the keyboard bottom and you end up with something that's hard to distinguish from a netbook, only it's running an Android OS.\n\nMY EXPERIENCE\n\nI am still getting myself used to a touch-driven OS and the built in apps and I didn't get a lot of third-party apps but not everything ran - tech support told me that not everything 'Android' will automatically run on Honeycomb so... try before you buy :) . However, whatever ran it did so without major problems. Except... playback was sometimes choppy when on full-screen mode but maybe it was so because I was running half a dozen other things at the same time.\n\nI should note that WiFi integration was flawless and, indeed, once on my local network, I was able not only to stream from media servers but to also open remote sessions on some of our Windows 7 and Windows Home Server machines.\n\nMY EVALUATION\n\nAfter a few days of use I am very happy with my purchase and I am considering a second for my other teen kid - but I may wait for the next great tablet because I don't expect the Transformer to stay the top non-Apple tablet forever. I wrote 'top tablet' because this is the best WiFi tablet deal you can get today.\n\nThe Transformer has a few minor issues: USB charging, the not-so-hard back, a little on the heavy side but the pluses overwhelm the 'issues' and the dock expansion is extremely innovative and it can even be a good 'transition' prop for those familiar with netbooks - but it does come at a price.\n\nI love my Transformer and Amazon's rating for 'I love it' is 5 stars.\n\n--\n>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<"}

I enjoy doing mobile computing around the house/neighborhood, but was never a laptop/netbook fan.  Mobile phone screens are way too small. This device is perfectly sized and works like a charm.\n\nIt's gorgeous, although a little heavier than I expected (I've never held an iPad).\n\nUnlike some cell phones, speakers are apparently on the front side, and sound is clear no matter how the device is resting.\n\nI won't lower it to 4-stars for these minor complaints, but there are some minor app install issues (haven't tried the Amazon app store on it yet).  Easily sorted.  In addition, while it could make me retire my Kindle (the Kindle app is perfect on it), there is a bit of glare in the light.  So the Kindle will stay for outdoor reading.\n\nMy miniHDMI adapter/cable arrives Monday, so I can update it's TV video output then.\n\nGreat so far.  Buy one when they're available!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I've had the Asus Eee Pad Transformer for 24 hours now.  It was easy to setup, it found my router in seconds and it's so intuitive to use. I let my husband use it, having never used a tablet before, he was able to figure it out in moments.  The screen is vibrant and can be viewed almost sideways.  That makes it very easy to set anywhere and still see what you're doing.  I've used other tablets that hurt my wrists because I couldn't see the screen unless I held the device or propped it up.\n\nI have a MSI Wind netbook, that I love, but I always wanted to it to have a touchscreen and still keep a keyboard.  As soon as I get the dock, I'll have my tablet/netbook combo.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I just got my ASUS Transformer today and have been testing it for about 3 hours. I am an iPad 2 owner but I use an Evo 4G and the iPhone 4 for work so I am used to using Apple and Android daily. I like the Android OS and the Apple OS almost the same and I stay outta of the fanboy wars. This review is for open minded consumers who may be trying to decide between an Android tablet or the iPad 2 so you won't read any bashing of either side in this review.\n\nI set up my iPad 2 and Transformer side to see to how they performed head to head. I will admit I'm no tech geek and my tests are only meant to show how the tablets perform on the spot without tinkering.\n\nWeb browsing:\nThis was almost a tie. When I pressed both screens at the same time to load webpages, the iPad 2 always finished 1st but barely.\n\nApps/Games:\nThe iPad 2 has a much better selection of quality apps built for a tablet. Netflix, ESPN, HBO Go, and the Time Warner cable app are apps I use everyday for sports, tv shows, and movies. Having these available on road trips makes traveling easy. I hope Android steps up and gets these same apps in the future to level the playing field.\n\nVideos:\nThe Transformer actually loaded videos on webpages faster than the iPad 2. It also had a clear advantage on YouTube loading videos faster without any buffering. Videos do look slightly better on the iPad 2 screen though because the screen looks just a little clearer.\n\nCustomizing:\nThe Transformer is much better in this area. It has widgets and you can customize almost any screen how you want to. I doubt any 2 people will have the same look on their Transformers.\n\nIn my honest opinion....you can't go wrong with either the Transformer or the iPad 2 because they both bring something special to the table. The iPad 2 is the industry leader and has all the games, apps, movies, and videos you could ever ask for. The Transformer is much cheaper than the iPad 2 and the Xoom but you can't tell in any way. The Transformer isn't cheap looking and isn't heavy. I didn't have any issues while surfing the net, watching videos, or downloading apps.\n\nMy biggest complaint is getting used to using the tablet sideways at all times. I prefer looking at my tablet like a magazine and like the up and down view over the sideways view. I can't take off any points because that is a personal preference. The only other knock is the gap in quality apps I mentioned before. I travel out of state at least once a month and love all the entertainment options the iPad 2 has and am already missing those apps for my Transformer.\n\nBottomline....you will not find a Honeycomb tablet that is a better value than this. This is my 1st ever ASUS purchase and so far I'm impressed. I always buy name brand electronics and was nervous going with a small off brand company but my fears have been put to rest.\n\nI will post a video on YouTube later under the name theoffice310 under the title ASUS Transformer so you can see some head to head tests with your own eyes. Feel free to ask questions and I will reply. I'm no geek so I cant answer technical questions and I don't jailbreak or root so don't ask stuff like that please."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "This is an absolutely fantastic device. I've had iPad (original one) since December and I've really grown to like the idea of tablets. However, I didn't like some features of iOS (mainly that you have to use iTunes for everything) so I decided to try a Honeycomb tablet. Honeycomb is absolutely amazing.\n\nThe device is very well built, good quality, awesome screen. I really can't find any flaws, other that sometimes software in general is a bit buggy (asus has released 4 updates in the last month alone, so this will probably be addressed very soon). I sold my iPad after playing with this for a few days. Couldn't be happier.\n\nDefinitely recommended, especially for the price."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I am a previous owner of the Archos 101, which was a decent tablet during its time, but as time goes by..it became sluggish and multitasking on it was a drag so I sold it on ebay and saved the money for my next tablet purchase. Then I heard about this tablet and I was anxiously anticipating its US release. I was one of the lucky ones who were able to grab one on Amazon on release day(April 26th). I received my package via OnTrac on the 27th. I opened my package and tried it out for about an hour before deciding to do the OTA update. A few people on the xda forum reported that they have bricked their Asus TFs because of the update so I was hesitant. However, everything went well for me and it was updated within five minutes.\n\n-First thing first. Sorry, no iOS vs Android comparison here. If you are looking at this item, you SHOULD already know the advantages and disadvantages for both OS.\n\n-The screen is AMAZING!! Viewing angle is superb. High resolution IPS LED LCD display with Corning Gorilla Glass for the win.\n\n-Only $399. $200 less than the Xoom. $100 less than the iPad 2. $50 less than the Acer Iconia a500. With equal or better hardware/features. You make the decision.\n\n-Android 3.0 is great. Very smooth usage. Very open-ended. Customizable to the max. True multitasking; with as many apps running in the background as the CPU can handle. Asus included some exclusive widgets and apps. Games run beautifully with no lag. I am new to Honeycomb, and I am enjoying it a lot.\n\n-Asus included a roll of numbers on the android virtual keyboard. That is very handy as i don't have to click an extra button to access the numbers. Most of my passwords have numbers and that saves a lot of time.\n\n-Flash 10.2. You can browse the internet without feeling left out. Yes, you get flashy ads also. I would say Flash works 95% because sometimes flash videos get laggy when maximized to full screen. Youtube app videos stutters when you play it fullscreen in HQ.  However, there is supposedly a fix of that issue coming soon for Honeycomb. Other than that, every flash based websites load fine.\n\n-Apps for Honeycomb is lacking right now but it should kick off soon. Some apps are not compatible with Honeycomb and will crash after installation. If you are a news junkie, Pulse is the app to get. Mobo player is the best video player to me. Many of the free games are very fun to play.\n\n-MyCloud was not there when my tablet came. I needed to do the OTA update for MyCloud to appear in the apps folder. Since the remote desktop in MyCloud can only connect to the PCs in your LAN network, I was excited to find out about LogMeIn ignition on the Android Market. You can buy the app to remotely control any PCs anywhere.\n\n-Plays back basic video formats like avi. Compared to my Archos 101 which is made by a French company, can play many video formats natively, even mkv. (I love European devices with their video playback capabilities)\n\n-Has built in GPS with a free downloadable text-to-speech plug-in on the Android Market.\n\n-Build quality is good for the price although not as good as iPad 2. The texture design on the back is nice and gives better grip.\n\n-Big bezel. Initially, the big bezel turned me off, but now I understood why Asus made it bigger than other comparable tablets. My old Archos has a thin Bezel and because of that I would accidentally touch the screen with my thumbs, wrecking havoc. With this tablet, my thumbs rest on the bezel and that problem was solved, and also my thumbs get some rest.\n\n-Two good cameras, on front and back. Picture quality is great, but video recording is average.\n\n-MicroSD slot and miniHDMI. I also ordered the keyboard so that I will have two USB ports.\n\n-Charging connecter is shorter than I expected. It can be a hassle if you want to use the tablet and charge it at the same time.\n\n-Power button and speakers are on the side. Unlike the Archos 101 and Moto Xoom, having speakers on the side means that when you put it flat down, your sound does not deteriorate. The right speaker is louder than the left for some reason. Hopefuly an update will fix that.\n\n-Battery life is good. Around 8-9 hours depending on your usage. Battery life can be extended with the keyboard dock, while transforming into a netbook.\n\nThe Asus TF is hot at $399, and I am enjoying it very much so far. This thing is in another league compared to my Archos 101. This product is rare right now and I hope Asus can ship more units(or maybe it's just a marketing strategy for more hype).\n\nAnyhow, this tablet is great and I am looking forward to future Android updates to make it even better. Five stars for a good tablet.\n\nHope this helps and have fun with your tablet(s)!\n\n*UPDATE 5/2/11* So, I have noticed that occasionally, apps force close in Android 3.0. I know this is a software issue with Asus and that there should be updates coming soom to address this. I have heard that the Acer a500 is more stable as of right now.\nI was at a shopping mall and saw an Apple show store so I decided to come in and play around with the iPad 2. One thing I want to mention is that you will never see any checker-boarding when surfing the net with the Asus TF.\n\n*UPDATE 5/4/11*\nSo the stuttering 720p video after recording has been solved after the OTA updates. It is much smoother now.\n\n**For those in the dark or have finally came out under the rock: This tablet retails at $399, so do not be a victim and buy it at $500+ from sellers on Amazon Marketplace. Also, you should not rate this item down because of third party sellers jacking up the price.**"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I am very impressed with this device. This is my first tablet, but I already own an android phone so I am familiar with the platform. I have also used a Xoom and both Ipad's. This device is hands down better then the xoom and I believe as good if not better then both Ipad's.\nPros\n- Great Screen\n- good battery life\n- Can use some of the apps I paid for on my phone.\n- No lag. I used the xoom and it was very laggy, perhaps it was because it was the store model but I was not impressed. This thing has no lag at all and I have not even played with the settings yet.\n-I have my computer set to stream content to my xbox and this tablet was able to find and access that content as well without any new setup on my part.\nCons\n- Screen does smudge easily. I also have more oily hands then is most too which does not help\n- No Netflix, this sucks but you can remote desktop very easily to your home pc and do this. This can even be setup to access when you're away from home.\n\nOverall if you have been considering a Honeycomb tablet this is the tablet to get. It's the cheapest tablet out there and one of the best. I believe the Gtab is better, but costs almost 300 more. The only thing the ipad can do which this tablet cannot is Netflix, that's it. Any argument about apps is bogus because you still have access to the 40,000 android phone apps many of which are being updated for honeycomb.\n\nUpdate 1:\nSo there are some build quality issues, the bezel around the edge pops out very easily. I am 6'4\" so I have big hands and I pop it out just holding the things at times. During one of those pop outs I broke the power button somehow and have to send it back for repair, hopefully under warranty. Its a real shame too since it unit feels pretty solid otherwise. And ASUS customer support is a very bad experience.\n\nUpdate 2:\nASUS replaced my unit under warranty and the whole process to get took 3 weeks door to door which is exactly as advertised in their warranty information. Also the people I talked to once my tablet was received were much more helpful and easy to understand so my initially bad experience may have been due to a specific employee rather than a system wide issue.\nOver the last 3 weeks there has also been several firmwire updates which fix some of the issues I had.\n\nHowever the unit still has two issues\n1. Build quality is not at Ipad 2, Xoom, etc level. The back bezel still flexes somewhat, but its better then my first unit.\n2. The unit randomly shuts down, not sure why it does this but it is annoying. A long press (10 seconds) of the power button restarts the unit in this case.\n\nOverall final impressions\n1. I bought this tablet because I wanted to use the keyboard dock accessory. If that interests you then this is without a doubt the tablet to get.\n2. This is a nice tablet, but for $100 more you can get the Samsung 10.1 (not at the time I write this, but very soon at least) which from what I have read seems to be a much better tablet. I would still chose the ASUS, but only because of the keyboard accessory. If I just wanted a tablet it would have been a well spent $100 upgrade."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I was one of the lucky view at the stroke of midnight on April 26th, was able to get my order in on Amazon. I just received my tablet tonight via Amazon Prime.\n\nI've been on Android since the original T-Mobile G1 released, and have owned an iPad since September of last year, so quite awhile on both. This is my first ownership experience of a Honeycomb 3.0 tablet.\n\nSoftware wise, there's not that much I can add in terms of what others haven't already said. It's VERY refreshing coming from iOS, to actually not be staring at pages and pages of useless icons. The notifications are ABSOLUTELY sweet (i.e. useful!). The app quick access with screenshots adds to a very desktop-esque experience, but with the navigability of a tablet UI.\n\nMost things run very smooth, typical of all the standard Tegra 2 devices. Speakers are surprisingly loud, and there are actually 2 of them (stereo). Screen is absolutely gorgeous (IPS).\n\nIf you're deep in Google services, such as Gmail, Picasa, Youtube, Docs, etc. Honeycomb is a godsend. I have almost 20gb's of photos in Picasa, and after one account setup, EVERY SINGLE PICTURE synced. Pretty much all my cloud files and settings synced. From Chrome bookmarks to docs to pictures.... it seriously is a breath of fresh air to have things \"just work\", without the use of something like iTunes.\n\nGranted, if you're not a Googler like me, it won't be AS beneficial, but that's not to say it's still not a great device.\n\nIt also charges FAST as hell. My iPad takes on average 6 hours to go from 0% to 100%. I haven't done a full discharge on the Asus, but it went from 7% to 100% in a little under 2 hrs. That's insane.\n\nThe not so great, both the front and rear camera seem slightly sub-par as far as clarity goes. Very usable, but not great. My only real complaint is the \"tightness\" of the construction. I absolutely don't mind the plastic. It's light, grippy, sturdy, and looks great. However, along the bezel where the plastic seems to meet the glass, the Transformer tends to creak. Nothing worth concern, but it would be nice for a device that's basically a slab of glass to \"sound\" solid in your hand. Then I think to myself, this thing cost 399... It's 100 bucks less then the cheapest iPad.\n\nSo, the question really isn't \"Is this thing awesome\" or \"is it better then an iPad\". I believe either of those answers are really up for interpretation. However, when you throw in the equation of PRICE...\"Is this thing awesome for 399\" , i have to give a resounding \"YES!\".\n\n****** Edit : Usage Update *******\n\nSo I've been using this tablet in place of my iPad exclusively for about 4 days now, and have better insight to the Transformer.\n\nThe good is that my previous complaint about the build quality really has proven to be a really superficial concern. It does faintly creak in a couple spots, but I would have to classify the actual severity as minimal to non-existant.\n\nAlso, after reading the issues with the Asus update, I decided to proceed since it's only been documented that a handful (i.e. less then 5) people out of potential thousands have actually had issues. My update went without an issue.\n\nI hear people complain about the lack of apps specifically for tablet. I can happily say that i haven't experience this limitation since even most non-tablet specific apps scale fine. \"things look stretched out\". Yes, that's actually an indication that Android was designed to scale properly (literally). Look at iOS, they literally blow up non iPad apps to the point of pixelation. Android's solution, while not ideal, is much better and most non-tablet specific apps actually work and look just fine. Having a FULL browser is incredibly helpful.\n\nThe notification system is awesome. Just this change makes this tablet twice as more productive then my iPad.\n\nNow, admittedly, there have been more not-so-good issues that I've discovered. First off, the tablet is definitely prone to freezes and locks. On several occasions it would just freeze completely and would require a reboot. Also, there have been several times where, when going from portrait to landscape, the resolution of the screen stayed fixed. This would result in an odd partial-screen view. Usually fixed itself after a couple of seconds of rotating the tablet. Other times, presses are unresponsive, ex. opening an app. This is definitely a software issue however, not an issue with the capacitive hardware.\n\nYouTube playback was surprisingly choppy, even in standard def. The recent update however, seemed to have improved that greatly.\n\nLast thing, just like most Android devices, the user experience is proned to \"slow-down\" once you've been on it for any decent amount of time. Can't be a RAM issue as this has 1GB, and at any given time there's only 400mb or so in use.\n\nAll in all, most of these problems are directly related to Honeycomb, not Asus Transformer hardware.\n\nIn actual use case, I would say I experience one of the above problems about 1-5% of the time I'm actually using the tablet. It's not enough to make it unusable at all, it's actually been a pretty positive experience. However, I now completely understand the sentiments that Honeycomb is \"half-baked\". Generally speaking, people read blogs that are writing 3rd hand information to begin with, and make that comment without actually having owned a Honeycomb tablet. Well, I have, and I understand now. As a consumer device, I still think it's fine, but there's enough glaring early version issues that I probably wouldn't reccomend something like this in business or enterprise use.\n\nLast thing, all you funny people in the comments trying to pigeon-hole me as a anti-Apple or pro-Apple, or whatever it may be... In all honesty, I'm one of the few people I've ever met that has one foot equally (and fully) planted in 3 completely separate platforms. I use iOS, OS X,Android,  and Windows 7 in equal capacities at work and at home, and my mobile OS of choice (outside of tablets) has been Android for the last 3 years. I do this because I LOVE and HATE various things about ALL the OS's I use, which is why I use 4 of them to fill in each other gaps. Take that as you will."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "First off this tablet is built very well. It has top notch components. The microsd slot actually works unlike the Xoom. The screen is fantastic, great viewing angles accurate colors. I guess that's what you get when you use the same type of screen as Apple uses on the iPad. The cameras do their job. The price is great at $50 less than a comparable Acer and $100 less than an iPad wifi, yet this tablet includes a GPS chip. My only complaint is the USB cord it came with is a little shorter than I'd like."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "...and here's why:\nASUS has heard the cries of the people...EXPANDABLE MEMORY, FLASH SUPPORT, MULTITASKING...This tablet has connectivity out the wazoo. The tablet itself has a microSD card slot (to instantly triple your memory), HDMI out, and the ability to control your PC or Mac desktops. As if that wasn't enough, you can connect the beautiful keyboard which has an additional battery (that doesn't just power the tablet, but charges it), not one-but TWO full size USB host ports, AND a FULL size SD card reader! The screen does 1280X800 with the full viewing angle. It houses a Tegra 2 processor and sports a full gig of RAM...On specs, the iPad loses so let's look at the price...Oh, what's this? It's only $399? BangBangBang...two in the chest, one in the head...Apple iPad is dead."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "I was lucky enough to wake up early today and go to Memory Express in Edmonton and they had one. Stores received a limited amount of tablets and they were all sold out within hours, including here on Amazon. I've been playing with this thing for hours now and so far I've only had great experiences with it.\n\nThe main feature for me is the remote desktop: you can access your PC, whether it's a Mac or a PC, if they're both connected to your home wi-fi connection. You can control your PC from anywhere and use all of its features. I watched a HD movie and worked on MS Word docs, everything went smoothly.\nThe tablet doesn't weigh much for its size and the IPS screen is amazing, it's the same screen used on the iPad 2. I'm not a person who needs to buy products made by just one brand. I like Apple and I own a iPhone 4, but when it came to deciding which tablet to buy, I went for the Transformer because it offers me a tablet/netbook function, the best of both worlds.\nThe tablet itself has a microSD card slot so I already have 32GB more to use it. The docking station (which can be purchased by 149.99) has 2 USB ports and 1 SD Card slot.\nYou can edit Microsoft Office docs on it using Polaris Office, it's great and this app comes pre-installed on it. Playing mp3s or acc files on it it's great too. You can use the app MyNet to play music from your own PC or Mac, via bluetooth.\n\nI'm playing SNES games using SNESoid app and using a Wiimote/Classic Controller via Bluetooth and everything works great! It has native email (which Blackberry Playbook doesn't) and you can sync your calendar and contacts easily. It has full flash compatibility. For $399, there's nothing on the market with these specs. The Motorola Xoom has similar specs and it costs $200 more. It doesn't give you the option to attach a docking station with all those slots. When I buy computers, I want to be able to upload content to it easily, or transfer files from it easily as well. The Apple system is ok but needing iTunes for everything is kinda like a dictatorship. I had to jailbreak my iPhone to be able to play SNES games on it, or even listen to music on Grooveshark. That's where the Android Market comes in.\n\nYou can download any apps you want, any developer can create apps for it, it's a \"free\" system. It's not as wide as the App Store, but it's getting bigger and bigger by the minute. I downloaded the Kindle app and already transferred all my e-books to it (I also own a Kindle and I love it).\n\nThere are some quirks that have to be tweaked with Honeycomb 3.0 OS and that's something Google is working on. That's easy since updates will be released (an update is scheduled in 2 days). So that will improve the overall performance of the OS. But I honestly didn't have any issues with it, I really like Honeycomb 3.0 so far.\n\nI definitely recommend this thing for people who want to use their tablets as an extension or even a replacement to their laptops. Asus has hit a home run with this one, since it costs much less than anybody else and its specs are great. It's hands down the best purchase I've had under 400 bucks.\n\nThe docking station is sold out anywhere else but I pre-ordered it on Amazon and I'm hoping to get it in a couple of weeks. I'll post a video with the combo once I get everything up and running. I'm a iOS person who's welcoming Android with open arms!\n\nReview Update: Apr 29 2011 - Ok, so I've been using my Transformer for a few days so I'd like to add a few pros and cons to this review.\n\nPros: beside what's been mentioned above, I noticed that:\n\n- multitasking is really easy on the Transformer. You can quickly jump from one app to the other, check e-mails, browse something on Wikipedia, listen to music and even have your Skype session open at the same time. I was chatting with my dad and multitasking and had no issues. The Skype app needs updates, but that's nothing to do with Asus.\n\n- File Manager: this feature is great! You don't have to hook up your Transformer to your computer all the time to move, copy or paste files. You can create new folders and even transfer files from your microSD card straight to it. I transferred a movie from my microsd Card folder (path is root\\removable to access microSD files) to my Movies folder and it was very quick. And I didn't need to plug it in in order to access or move the files.\n\n- Widgets: Your Desktop Area (Or Asus Launcher) is very wide so you can add many widgets to it, and they're very handy. That's something that can't be done on the iPad 2. Mind you Widgets can affect the speed a bit, but nothing noticeable at all. Those people running speed tests between iPad 2 and the Transformer need to bear that in mind.\n\n- Weight: believe it or not, it doesn't feel heavy at all for its size.\n\nCons: ok, so here it is:\n\n-smudges on screen - it's a fingerprint magnet but all tablets are, so not a big deal. I'm cleaning it whenever needed using a nice cloth (the one that I use for lenses) with a bit of water/alcohol and it looks pristine after that. Let me know if you find a better way to clean fingerprints.\nIt doesn't need wiping on a daily basis. I looked it up and for IPS screens, the best way to clean it is to use a mix of distilled water and alcohol, but I'm using tap water. I like this thing so much that I would buy another one tomorrow if something happened to it! (wait, maybe not tomorrow, it's still sold out everywhere)\n\n-HD video playback in Fullscreen mode using the YouTube App: ok, this might be Honeycomb-related and therefore something that can be dealt with via future updates. You might notice a bit of choppy frames here and there. I find the iOS more stable for this type of playback. But there's no problems playing HD video from your microSD card or even if you upload a HD video to the Transformer hard drive, you won't have problems watching it. There's more than enough RAM to support HD video streaming.\n\n-charger: I'm planning on using it all the time, so the cord is not long enough. If I have it on a desk, I need a power bar or outlet really close by, to leave it plugged in if I wanna save some battery. Well, tablet + docking gives you 16 hrs of battery... so you really don't have to have it plugged in. But this suggestion could be emailed to Asus so they could release a charger with a longer cable, that would be sweet.\n\nOther observations: Camera: not that great, it's an average camera. Am I gonna use it for super important pics? Definitely not, I got a nice camera for that. But for daily use, it's not too bad.\n\n***UPDATE June 13*** - I've been using the TF for 6 weeks now, and I also have the keyboard dock, which I got 2 weeks ater getting the tab. I can safely say it has become my main \"go to\" device: web browsing, music, movies, games, word processing, reading books and comics, news, remote desktop, you name it. I still use my PC and my smartphone but not as much as I use the tablet.\n\n- For people who wonder if light bleed gets worse as time goes by: I was lucky enough to get a unit with no light bleed other than a tiny spot (barely noticeable) on the left side of the tablet, and it's been the same since day 1. But compared to my friend's iPad, I can safely say mine has no light bleed whatsoever. Some of the newer batches got units with really bad lemons but I think this was due to ramping up the production like crazy. I heard they manufactured 300,000 units in June so I think they'll improve their quality control dept and make spanking sharp units now.\n- Honeycomb 3.1: Asus was one of the first ones to release the 3.1 update and it fixed the YouTube app HD video issue (at least on mine). I think 1080p is overkill on a 10.1 inch screen so the 720p HD on the YouTube app works like a charm. Playing movies straight out of a SD card or USB drive is easy and there's no lag either, so feel free to pack lots of multimedia and play straight out of them without having to use your device's internal memory.\n\nTouchscreen is much more responsive, browser is faster, animations flow more smoothly, full gamepad compatibility via USB, better \"relationship\" between dock and tablet. What really bugged me about 3.0 was that when I used the dock a lot of features seems to be toggled on/off. That has never happened after 3.1. So, overall, the update fixed a whole bunch of bugs and made the experience even better.\n\n- Wrapping it up: battery life is great, using the keyboard to type long texts is handy... and I was able to tether the TF to my iPhone via w-fi, so now it works as a 3G-like tab. I've done both bluetooth and wi-fi tethering. Wi-fi is faster but bluetooth saves battery life. I basically do it to use Google Maps and GPS, and it's been great so far. I know they're releasing a 3G Transformer in the summer, but I don't need one since I don't wanna pay more fees to my carrier, and sign another 1 year contract just for more data plan. I can use this as a 3G alternative whenever I need a bigger screen. It works with the iPhone and I know it does work with Android devices, but I'm not sure if works with Blackberry phones. Let me know if you wanna know more about tethering and I'll be glad to help.\n\n6 weeks after purchasing the TF, I'm still very pleased with my device.\n\nUPDATE August 3rd 2011 - Honeycomb 3.2 main features - I got my 3.2 update a few days ago... there's just a few things that were updated, or changed. It wasn't as significant as 3.1, but here's what I noticed about 3.2: compatibility zoom for fixed size apps - it helps with apps that are not designed to run on larger screens like 10.1 inches. I tested it and it's actually a great improvement, compared to what it was in 3.1\nMedia sync from SD - I already did that before, but now you can load any media straight from the microSD card (this is more for Xoom owners)\nI don't think there were any changes on high def videos, I think it still outputs in 720p, no true 1080p yet on youtube and stuff, but like I said before, 720p is more than enough on a 10 inch screen.\nBetter hardware acceleration, updates to widgets and Movie Studio app, now Honeycomb can also run on 7 inch tablets, and some other minor ones... I'm enjoying Honeycomb while it lasts, since it will phase out in a few months (Ice Cream Sandwich is coming). Overall, I'm still having loads of fun with the Transformer!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004U78JT8", "review": "UPDATE:  I am writing a much-overdue update to my initial review (preview actually).\n\nI received my TF-101 right on time, and one thing bothered me right away:  I had a very hard time turning it on, and when i did, there was considerable light bleed.  Also, there was a very prominent \"creaking\" of the housing, as well as some poor finishing on the bezel, so the metal wasn't evenly shaped!  I couldn't believe this!  I would almost lower my score to 3 or 4 stars (still decent rating because other than those build-quality issues, everything else was amazing!) but ASUS tech support saved the day!\n\nGranted, it took several emails back and forth to get someone to understand what I was talking about, even with photos.  That was a little frustrating.  With an escalated support ticket, I finally got the proper attention, and was given an RMA.  Replacement did take a while due to the shortage of units, but not as long as I would have thought.  When I got my replacement, I was THRILLED!  this thing was like night and day from my launch-day unit!  Zero noticeable light bleed (there may have been a TINY amount but not really noticeable, and normal on a display like this at the time of manufacture), no unfinished edges, no trouble starting up (deep sleep etc).  This is the tablet I've been waiting for!\n\nfast forward almost a year later, and I did end up selling it on eBay (well, a local guy wanted to trade for a brand new warranty replacement iPad 2, which I gladly did, not because I wanted an iPad 2, but because Apple devices hold their resale value very well, and I had read about the tf300 that was coming out and wanted one.  When the TF300 came out, I sold the iPad 2, and used the money to buy a TF300 & keyboard dock.  I'm loving it!  It seems like the TF300 is the transformer the TF101 should have been.  /End of UPDATE\n\nORIGINAL (P)REVIEW:\nI haven't received my ASUS tf101 eee pad transformer yet; it is scheduled to be delivered in two days, at which point I'll update my review, but there are a couple things I wanted to write about.\n\nOne thing is that giving an item 1 star, simply to state that 3rd party resellers who sell out-of-stock items at inflated prices are terrible, is terrible too. You are lowering the rating of an excellent device for no good reason. Do you even understand what you are rating and reviewing? It is the PRODUCT, not some third-rate reseller, that the review and stars are supposed to reflect. Granted, sometimes an item's main distributor is awful, and the review is helpful by warning other buyers of bad business practices, but generally, people refer to the rating of a product as just that: the rating of a product.\n\n/rant\n\nThe other thing is that I have wanted a tablet since before the iPad came out, and though ive mostly used iPhones since the launch of the original model, I didn't want to shell out big bucks for an iOS tablet. I loved the IPS-type display of the iPad line, but really couldn't justify buying another iOS device even though I like the platform on many levels.  I didn't want a tablet locked into the apple business model, and when iPad 2 came out, I was sorely disappointed that A) the only upgrades were a dual core processor with the same specs, poor quality cameras I won't really use, a thinner form factor which as a 17\" laptop user doesn't matter all that much to me, and the same amount of ram as my iPhone 4 and B) the best jailbreak-enabling exploits had been patched up for the most part, and without a proper jailbreak, iOS is definitely a no-go for me.\n\nDespite all that, I was almost resigned to the iPad 2 (for now, until something better would appear next year or end of this year) because nothing else up until a month ago had the screen quality, specs, and features that I demanded, and just as important, I realized there were certain iOS apps I really rely on for my IT Job, and others (less crucial) for entertainment.\n\nTwo things happened about a month ago:\n\n1) I saw a small write-up about the ASUS transformer, and started looking into it. I have an ASUS core i7 17\" laptop which I LOVE, and I've exclusively used ASUS mainboards for my pc builds for over 6 years now, after 5 previous years of trial and error which showed me how reliable their products were.  When I heard that the transformer would be dual-core A9 based (ala tegra II) and had gorilla glass, a nice clean look around the edges with a taper akin to the iPad's profile, and most most importantly, an IPS display, I was so excited!  ASUS, combined with my favorite aspects of the iPad, and an android 3.0 OS!\n\n2) I nervously navigated to the android app store via my browser to see if there were any equivalent apps to the ones I used most in iOS, since it seemed I had found my ideal tablet (for the rest of this year and hopefully most of next).  I was pleasantly surprised to find that most of my most used apps existed for android too!  The others all had alternatives that look like they should work just fine.\n\nIn summary, for me, this tablet combines the best elements of what's available to me right now.  I'm sure within a year, or even months, I will probably find something even more suited to my needs and desires, but this will definitely do just fine for now, and I am happy to have finally found my entry point into the tablet computing world.  I will update this review when I have the device in-hand"}
