{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "This is a very clean looking, newer version of the previous Acer chromebook. The aluminum plate on the top is a nice touch and the battery lasts a long time like other chromebooks. For the price, this computer is a steal! I started using chromebooks a year and a half ago for online school and have never looked back. I use my windows laptop for music and video production (because those are some of the only things you can't do on a chromebook) and now utilize ChromeOS for everything else. Word processing with Google Docs, photo editing with pixlr.com, and hosts of other applications are available. Sometimes it is a bit of a challenge to find the right apps to use as an alternative to Windows, but if you really wanted to you can just put a linux distro on there with crouton. Super easy.\n\nThe screen is very bright on this one and the keyboard is a standard chromebook one. I don't like the touchpad very much and my Samsung Chrombook 2 has a better one, so that would be the only downside. Good color, aesthetics, and usability!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "I want to give a brief background of where Im coming from and what I think about the new Acer Chromebook 11.  In the past I have owned a Thinkpad laptop, a Dell notebook with a touchscreen and pen, and a couple of tower desktop computers.  I have also owned two Android devices.  These days I mostly use an Ipad for web browsing and apps, and a desktop for word processing, printing, Microsoft office needs, the occasional game, etc.  I needed something at my work that was small and light and did not need a lot of computing power.  I didn't want to spend much money.  After hearing about Chromebooks for a while, I did as much research as I could and decided a Chromebook fit the bill.\nAmazon has a ton of Chromebooks, and I was about to buy the Chromebook 11 from last year, then found an article that was 1 day old saying that Acer had just released their new 2016 version of the 2 GB Chromebook 11.  They explained that this one was built to be quite durable with an aluminum lid, and that it would feature an IPS screen, for only $179.  They said a 4 GB version was bound to be released soon, and I wish it were available, but I figured 2 GB is adequate for my needs.  I followed the link to Amazon, and found it here.\n\nFirst impressions:\n\nBuild quality  It is not as tightly put together as say a tablet or a high end laptop, but it feels very well made.  The screen articulates well and the lid feels sturdy.  The keyboard has a nice feel to it, much better than my Logitech for my iPad, and Id say just about as good as any laptop Ive used.  It does have a strip of plastic between the track-pad and the space bard which is somewhat flimsy, though, and when I press down with moderate pressure, the whole middle of the keyboard flexes.  Overall, though, I am impressed, especially for $179.  Haven't dropped it yet, but I think it would survive.\n\nErgonomics  The keyboard feels like a full size; the volume and power buttons are in a good place, and the keyboard is comfortable to type on.  The trackpad is larger than Im used to and even the fastest setting doesnt feel fast enough for me as I usually have to lift my finger off the trackpad to get from one side of the screen to the other.  I like the no buttons choice of the trackpad though, and how the whole pad just clicks down if you feel you need a click.  The SIZE and WEIGHT are incredible!  I guess most chrome books are this way, but I am amazed.  It feels lightweight but not cheap.  The keys are not backlit.  Webcam is stationary, and I doubt I will ever use this with Facetime on the ipad / iphone so simple and easy.  Maybe they could do a version without this and drop another $20?\n\nDisplay  The display looks very bright, crisp; just what youd expect from an IPS screen.  Now if I can only manage to stop poking it with my touch-screen trained fingers, I expect it to last.  The fact that it is not a touch-screen makes this feel more like a laptop to me.\n\nColor   It looks good in white casing with black keys (kind of like a piano), but white would not be my first choice due to the inevitability to show dirt and oil after a while.  Also the exterior it textured, which feels cool, but will probably attract more dirt that way.\n\nSound -- Volume is pretty loud.  Not sure the decibels, but is is louder than an laptop, phone, or tablet I've had.  I was surprised to hear what sounded like stereo Left and Right sound coming from a video, when I looked on the bottom and noticed it had two speakers.  Only realistic improvement would be if they could have mounted the speakers on the front instead of the bottom.  I could imagine it getting muffled if on a blanket or other soft surface.  But the sound exceeded my expectations for the price for sure.\n\nSoftware  having no background in Chrome OS, I find this software simple and easy to understand.  You cant really screw it up.  Somewhat disappointed with the app store.  Does not seem like a lot of high quality apps to pick from, but that is coming from an apple user (and previously android).  UPDATE: the \"OK Google\" feature which allows voice searches and commands was not working.  I spent an hour on a help chat with google, and they couldn't determine the problem, but finally asked me to \"Powerwash\" the machine, essentially wiping it and returning it back to factory state.  It took about 2 minutes to powerwash and set it up again, and the \"OK Google\" feature miraculously worked again.  I have had no other OS issues.\n\nSpeed  The computer starts almost as instantly as a phone.  Clicking on anything gives no lag.  It is snappy, and I think it will stay that way.  Youtube streams beautifully.  Webpages load fast.  If they had had the 4 GB version, I would have considered it, but 2 GB is not too slow for me right now.\n\nValue  Cant believe it was only $179.  Great job Acer, and great job Amazon for getting it to me in a day and a half with Prime.\nI will make sure to update as I use it more, and if my opinion changes."}

The reason is that it has the nicest display (IPS) you'll see at this price point on any platform from any brand. This is not a full HD display but rather a lower resolution 1366x768 display. Nevertheless it looks much better than the TN panels you'll see on other similarly priced devices.\n\nIt's powered by last year's Intel N2840 Celeron processor at 2.16ghz and has 2 gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes of on board storage. The Acer Chromebook 11's SD card slot does sit flush to the side of the computer though, so it does provide some opportunities for expanded storage.\n\nPerformance is decent for basic web browsing tasks and on par with other devices from Acer and others at this $180 price point.\n\nThe hardware overall is well constructed and it's very comfortable to type on. My only gripe is with its trackpad that requires a little too much of a push to register clicks. This is an exceptional value for $179.\n\nI do suggest that you watch my ChromeOS 101 video to learn more about what Chromebooks are and what they are not:"}

Gallium was very easy to install and the performance is incredible, I love how it manages the system resources except the battery that goes from 9 hours in Chrome OS to 6-7 hours in Gallium OS, but it's not a big deal, I can do most of the things I did in Windows. In fact, I've been working 8 hours a day from Monday to Friday during the last 2 months with this little warrior and I feel I can't ask for more. In addition I was able kept Chrome OS with dual boot but I rarely use it.

There is a search button where it should be, when it gets pressed it pops up a large menu in front of what you are working on.\n\nNice to be continuously connected to Google, but can't use without internet connection.\n\nNo delete button, you cannot delete text following the cursor. You have to move the cursor to the end of the word to delete.\n\nCopy and Paste does not work for Google presentations to Google docs.\n\nHave to press alt key to right-click.\n\nThere is no auto screen print, you have to enable the add-on\n\nWhen trying to open file with microsoft office 365, file is automatically opened with Google office instead. If you right click \"open with\", only Google office shows.\n\nGave three stars cause for super basic web browsing, it's fine. For study and work, it is insufficient and often frustrating.\n\nIf you need something for school/work, pick a non-google product."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "The Good:\nThis Chromebook is incredibly light and has a solid 9 hours worth of battery. If you are looking for a portable web-browsing machine, this is a solid choice. It can connect to both my 2.4G and 5G wireless networks, has easy Bluetooth pairing capabilities, and a lot of options to customize many aspects of the device. The power-on time is absolutely amazing! From the moment of pressing the power button, the unit takes less than 15 seconds to get you to the login screen.\n\nThe OK:\nWith more and more services moving to cloud-based offerings, we use our web browser to access many of these offerings instead of installing applications that run locally on your computer. For things like Gmail, Amazon Video, etc this isn't uncommon and feels normal. For other apps (some in competition with Amazon services so I will refrain from naming them here :) ), this is a little more awkward, especially with some of the web apps being less feature-rich than their locally-installed counterparts. With this Chromebook, almost everything opens in the Chrome browser. Even \"apps\" installed from the store are often just links to the app's web interface. There are a few exceptions, but they are an exception, not the standard. As a general statement, this is workable. Robust web interfaces have done a great job at minimizing the awkwardness of this, but it's just something to note about how this works differently than a laptop. One other notable item that's not good or bad, just different, is there is no right-click option on the touchpad. In order to right-click on anything (such as to open a link in a new tab in Chrome), you have to press the Alt key at the same time you click the touchpad. That is not intuitive or apparent, so it took some a little web searching to find out how to do it. Once you know, you can adapt, but again, just a difference.\n\nThe Ugly\nBecause this unit is not able to use the Android app store, there is a VERY limited selection of apps. I use IFTTT on my cell phone for a variety of automated tasks (if you aren't familiar with the app, you should check it out!), however there is no official app or extension that can be used for this Chromebook. This device uses the Chrome Web Store, which is sorely lacking in offerings. There is no Uber or Lyft apps, as other quick examples.\n\nAll that said, as long as you know what to expect from this device and are ok with the use cases, it's pretty solid. I use mine for streaming movies to my Chromecast from Amazon Video, Plex, and YouTube with no lag or choppiness. I also use it a lot for web browsing, be it shopping, research, or fantasy football.  For the price (got mine on sale over the holidays for less than it's listed as of 3-11-2018), it's a decent unit..just know what you are getting into and don't assume this is a really cheap laptop...it's not."}

I then reordered a new Chromebook. My kids love the Chromebooks. Very fast, easy to set up, and perfect for their needs (google classroom, Netflix, social media, YouTube, etc.) Chabging review to 4 stars. Thanks"}

It an okay laptop to combine it with a desktop-laptop combo, but by itself, you're going to find problems.\n\nPros: the price is great. The keyboard has a little flex to it, but pretty stable and you can write a book, play small flash games, watch youtube videos and Netflix films to 1080p. 9 hours of battery life (11 hours if you lower the brightness) I once dropped this laptop and it hit the side of a sofa, and it took the damage like a champ. Hardly see the dent in it.\n\nCons:  Speakers are loud and when reached to the highest volume, the sound would get grainy. The track-pad can easily get messy, so clean it. Not as much more things to do with the laptop, but for 160 dollars what do you expect?\n\nVerdict: great for people who are starting out, like children, elders, budgeteers, and people who'd like to mess around on the web and only the web. other than that search for something else."}

That's the reason why I marked off a star, as I expected a little more from the cpu, but all-in-all, what this laptop has is great value.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "Got this model a year ago. My 07 macbook pro was in need of replacement, and while I am an Mac person (I LOATHE Windows),  I did not want the hefty Apple price tag. Enter Chromebook. After doing some research, it sounded like a Chromebook would be perfect for my needs - everything I needed to do for work was dependent on online programs rather than software and my personal use was just for the basics of email/social media /web browsing.\n\nI chose this model because I trusted Acer and also because I loved the small size and I couldn't help but notice there was something kind of macbook mini-esque about it...... Perfect for me to take wherever I go! My only complaint is the white does get dirty for me as its usually either in a backpack or behind the counter of a busy bar - but other than that, this thing is perfect!\n\nAlthough I was a little scared to get a laptop that was under $200, all i really needed it for was to edit documents for work, manage our online payment processor, and send emails to customers. For documents It took a little figuring out, but with Word and Xcel online, coupled with DropBox or OneDrive, this thing turned out to be a breeze to use for simple work documents I was editing daily. Also, the battery lasts forever! I don't even bring the charger with me to work!\n\nIt's been used at least 5 days a week for the past year and it has more than exceeded the value of $200. This little laptop is fantastic. If you have simple needs and want portability and reliability buy this laptop. Over all this Acer Chromebook has exceeded my expectations. I would give this 10 stars if I could!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "While knowing it's not the top of the line with every feature available, I have no complaints. People newly purchasing this might want to check which version of Chrome is running, as the one I received was running a much outdated version and I had to manually update the OS by reinstalling (a very easy task a quick google search will have you on your way in minutes) due probably to outdated firmware, but nonetheless a rather simple process if needed. All other things aside, there's not a lot to say except it lives up to what it claims: long battery life, average display, the keyboard is responsive and I actually find it quite quick to type on compared to my other computers. The only thing I wish I'd done was do more research beforehand as to which models (rather than just version of Chrome) allowed the Android app Play Store, but depending on your needs that might not be an issue. If the main thing you want to be able to do is quickly and efficiently browse the web with a reliable and long lasting (and light!) platform, you won't be disappointed."}

I had been using a Dell laptop for years and needed a replacement that wasn't going to cost me a few hundred dollars. Purchased on Black Friday for a considerable savings but after using it for a month or so I would have gladly paid full price for this. A little hard to get used to after saving and editing files on a Dell, especially since I had not been using Google docs for editing purposes unless I needed to in a pinch. Hardest thing to adjust to was the lack of storage and the smaller keyboard. If you use a smart phone to do most of your web surfing then a Chromebook will be a good choice for an inexpensive laptop. I only use the CHromebook for surfing the web and there are sufficient apps available to handle all of my needs. Haven't really used it without wifi so I can't speak to its usefulness without connectivity but it was a good investment. Starts up in seconds and has a long battery life."}

TOGETHER they cost less than any of my previous laptops, they are both faster than my previous laptops, and I haven't had a single issue with either so far. Do yourself a favor and ditch the overpriced laptops. Get a Chromebook (this one in particular) for the convenience, and a cheap desktop for the memory. I had 3 HPs and 2 ASUS laptops before getting this chromebook if anyone cares. Macbooks might be a different story, I wouldn't know, but I do know I'm happy as can be with this cheap combo."}

This Chromebook paid for itself within the first week. I was able to continue teaching online classes, write articles in Google docs, and then they have a feature that allows you to export the document as MS Word. The eleven inch screen is the right combination of ease of view and lightweight....which says a lot since Im used to a 27 desktop screen and wear glasses as thick as coke bottles. I upgraded to 4MG for an extra $20.... Great value if you want a travel computer, but don't want to spend money for features you don't need."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "I just got this Chromebook a couple of weeks ago on Cyber Monday on sale for $100. To say I'm satisfied is an understatement. This particular Chromebook is just extraordinary. The keyboard feels great and just has a very high-quality feel to it. The ISP screen looks fantastic, perhaps looking even better than my 20 inch monitor hooked up to my Windows desktop. And the touchpad is incredibly responsive and a pleasure to use. Overall the entire machine just feels high quality and functions spectacularly.\n\nMoreover, one of the things I especially love about this machine and Chromebooks in general, is the fact that it goes instantly on, instantly off, and comes out of sleep instantly. This stands in direct contrast to My Windows desktop which would sometimes takes 10 minutes before I can get online and sometimes forces me to wait 3 to 5 minutes for it to just shut off.\n\nWeb browsing is like lightning. I feel like I have a different internet provider using this machine. With My Windows desktop websites that take 30 seconds, 1 minute, or perhaps even lock up my computer entirely open up instantly on this Chromebook. And this is using a WiFi connection that is essentially in the corner of my basement. And yet the web speeds are incredible and the connection is beyond stable.\n\nI also love the fact that with this machine as is the case with all Chromebooks, you no longer have to worry about installing an antivirus, or getting viruses, or getting your Windows updates. It's essentially maintenance-free.\n\nAlso, as compared to my Windows computers where the performance seems they get slower and slower with each passing week this machine has not slowed down at all. It is just as fast today as the day I got it.\n\nOne final thought for anyone concerned about the size of the screen. I was a bit concerned that the screen might be too small but it hasn't proven to be an issue at all. Three steps I do easily take care of that problem. I set the font size to large. I set the web pages to load full screen. And I make the default setting of the zoom feature 125%. Some websites I've even zoomed to 175 or 200% and they still look perfectly fine to read. You can easily change the zoom Factor by simply pressing Ctrl +, or control minus.\n\nOverall, I am just in love with the whole Chromebook concept, and this Chromebook in particular is nothing short of fantastic. I couldn't recommend it any more highly."}

Nice size and the keyboard is very comfortable to use with ease. Nicer than some brands Ive used in the past. The screen and color is bright and crisp.\n\nNow what is going to take done getting use to is the mouse pad which is much different having gone from an iBook. Also, prior to going to Apple, weve always used Windows so now going to Chrome has left us baffled where everything is located!\n\nThe other great thing is that my husband is just using it to browse the internet which will give him lots of opportunity to figure things out as to settings and differences between Chromebook vs iBook and Windows. Itll be a challenge but like anything else, change is good, right? Well, at this price it is at least :)\n\nIm sure Ill probably update the review to five stars once he gets the hang of it and tells me how much he loves it; but for right now, its a strong like."}

I bought one when I started college a couple of years ago to bring with me to class for notes and writing papers. It's compact and fairly light. Never had any durability problems and gave my first one to my mom and bought my second one a week ago. This laptop won't be able to download any games or anything like that due to the Chrome OS and I don't know a lot about computers but I don't think this laptop would handle any games that an iPhone couldn't handle. Again, if you're looking for a laptop for yourself or your kid for school or to write papers and browse facebook and watch youtube, this laptop is perfect for that."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "So I'm going to start by saying this is the best Chromebook under 200 dollars. Nice screen, lightweight, great battery life.  With that being said it is also one of the most limited, no playstore support as of December 2017.\n\nThe chrome web store doesn't have much to offer in terms of apps you would need for basic internet computing. It's fine for browsing the web and using Google web apps but in terms of file support it's horrible. No support for torrents, magnets or file compression outside of a limited zip file tool.\n\nI understand that this is a web based laptop but things that have been standard for over 10 years are completely ignored. I can get more done on a low level Android tablet then I can on this laptop and it is simply because google hasn't brought the playstore to this platform yet.\n\nAnother plus side it's easy to ditch chrome os and install a proper version of linux."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! This is not one of the latest Chromebook models, but it is certainly one of the best. The IPS screen is simply gorgeous! I have a Windows laptop costing about five times as much and this screen is definitely better. The keyboard is another highlight for me. Many laptop keyboards have keys that are too \"squishy\" with too much travel and not enough resistance. This one is just right. It is also VERY light and yet sturdily built, with an attractive patterned aluminum top cover. Battery life is another wonderful feature - if you need a machine that lasts the entire work day or school day, you won't be disappointed. I easily get around 9 hours, with the screen at about 75% brightness, which is still very bright. Also has a full-size SD card slot, which is nice since I had several camera cards sitting around. As some Chromebooks have lately advanced (strayed?) from the original standards, adding more power, size, weight and expense, I am happy that this model is a prime example of Google's original intent: Secure, inexpensive, sturdy and extremely mobile, with quick access to online content and enough computing power to satisfy the daily needs of nearly all users. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nYou can do MS Word, Excel, etc., using the Chrome Store app, or just go directly to Office365, where you can edit and save work (for free). As for Android Apps, this model is on the list to integrate the Google Play store. Am expecting it soon. Google has been SLOWLY working their way through each model listed.\n\nP.S. For those complaining that Chromebooks don't do certain things, you'll find that they do if you just search for Chromebook help. You only need to learn a few new keyboard shortcuts."}

On a positive note it's a very fast Microsoft chip in till it processes information quickly it connects to the web and stays connected to the web or Wifi it is updated on a regular basis you have three different phases that you can be into being stable developer or beta developer being your safest bet if you want an update every week betas little bit on the risky side but the Chromebook I believe is going to be a great study tool and business tool for the upcoming feature that was why I invested in it"}

My review is based on it's total failure and the journey a warranty repair started. First it cost me $40 to ship the computer to their repair center after it failed 5 months after I got it. Would turn on , wouldn't charge absolutely dead. Acer did a good job on line of letting me know where they were in the process, they recieved the computer, repair was underway, and it had been shipped back. The whole process took about 10 days. Pretty slick really. The only problem was that when I got it back it was still absolutely dead. just as when I sent it in. So after an angry phone call they sent me a shipping label, this time at their expense ( the way it should have been the first time under warranty). Another week's wait and the computer is back working well again. This time there was an explanation that they had replaced the main board. It's a super machine again but I worry what it's reliability will be in the future, and I thought it was not cool to cause this much cost and inconvenience without the slightest apology. I will be very wary about this kind of purchase online in the future. Don't assume that everything will be backed up by Amazon's normal stellar warranty system."}

Don't buy this if you know what's good for you. You've been warned."}

Appears 2gb Chrome ram equals about 200 elsewhere... lol. Seriously, it's blazing fast, beautiful video playback quality and INSTANT on (both device and apps). It is super light, very well made and appears tight and solid. I seldom write reviews but had to praise this thing. I use a 15\" laptop but prefer this smaller, easy to read tight pixel screen. The camera image quality initially appears to be lesser than my laptop but is fully functional and NOT a deal breaker! Only tried it once quickly via Google Hangouts and could be instead wifi or lens-needs-cleaning related. This device is an excellent value."}

Users would need to login using their own gmail account in order to use Apps.  Which means, you as the parent cannot control the content, search, and sites that your child can access.\n\nThere is a \"Supervised\" account that can be used but then they will not be able to use Apps downloaded from Google Play.  Some of the school assignments require the downloading of Apps available on iOS or Android, PC.\n\nThe \"Supervised\" account also does not have an age range setting which would restrict \"inappropriate\" content.

It is very affordable, lightweight and portable. I take it with me to class to take notes and I do my online readings on it. All of my notes and spreadsheets are saved in google drive and can be made available offline, so they can be edited without an internet connection. I can also download PDFs to read offline. It does not have a lot of storage space, so I go through and delete any downloads immediately after Im done with them. It also doesnt have a lot of processing power, so you cant open infinite tabs (I try to keep it to 5 or 6 tabs as long as Im not streaming anything - its crashed on me before when I had too many tabs going). As another reviewer mentioned, the battery life is GREAT on this thing. I only charge it like every other day and I use it for hours daily. It obviously has its limitations and probably isn't ideal as your main/only computer, but if you just need portable web browsing and word processing its great."}

I have Prime so shipping is always fast and they were packaged safely and well. As for speed a Chromebook can NOT be beaten, especially for the price! If you are unfamiliar with Chrome OS I will attempt to explain a few of the differences between this and a 'regular' laptop- I am not a techie so please excuse the 'lay-speak'. First off- Chromebooks are cloud based, which means all updates are done 'in the cloud' without you having to do anything at all and without interrupting your computer time. Also viruses are not an issue with cloud based OS which is GREAT if you have kids and teens who want to download every new game and mod they see! You don't need to pay for virus protection because you can't download anything into the hard-drive. You CAN download pictures and videos into your files so you can save your important stuff. Also because it's cloud based you can access your photos anywhere you can log into your Chrome account. These Chromebooks stream videos without lag even with multiple pages open. I've NEVER had lag. They do not have optical drives so you can't watch DVD's but with Hulu and Netflix and Amazon Video that has never been an issue for us. I've heard people complain about the keyboard not having caps lock or other things they are used to but it is VERY easy to change your keyboard to your liking- for example, I have never used the built in 'search' button so I changed it to be my 'caps lock'. All you need to do is look up \"how to change a chromebook keyboard' or something similar and  you will find easy to follow instructions. Chromebooks also have a built in word program that is compatible with Microsoft Word and easily converts. My children's school uses it for all homework assignments and it is quite intuitive, more so than Word for me. Sorry about the rambling and the length of this review but I just can't say enough good things about these Chromebooks! If you are on the fence take the plunge and BUY A CHROMEBOOK!! Acer are the best in my opinion!! I plan on buying at least one more of these for Christmas this year, possibly two!"}

The speed is amazing, the keyboard is the best one I have ever worked with (and if you have larger fingers, the spacing between keys would help not to hit the neighboring keys) and the keys are of good size, making it easier to type, the simple navigation with so many options to add for extensions, you truly make this your own, not just a little of your style but all the way.  I am amazed how much storage there is!!  It is also so lightweight and fits into my backpack easily.

And as soon as the warranty or return time runs out with amazon a couple of keys on the keyboard keep getting stuck and won't work. So he really only got 1 and a half month's good usage on the keyboard. Now the down arrow key and right arrow key won't work. We tried to take them out and fix them but they are not fixable. It is very frustrating. I expected it to last a little longer than that. He wasn't rough on the keyboard and didn't spill anything. They just started not working or staying flat and not clicking.

Sadly, even having more than one window in Google Chrome is sufficient to cause glitches in video and sound. Using this Chromebook is akin to having a Windows laptop that is on the verge of crashing. I have used my girlfriend's old Acer Chromebook (I think it was made in the year 2014), and it functions better than this laptop. It's too bad- I do not have confidence that this laptop will age well, which is what Chromebooks are supposed to be best at. It does not seem reliable.\n\nThis is my second Chromebook- I returned the first Chromebook, which I though was just defective (and had all of the same problems, plus occasionally simply restarting on its own). There is a possibility that this Chromebook might have been dropped while being shipped to me or something, but I consider it unlikely to have received two damaged laptops in a row. To be transparent, this laptop is completely updated, ruling out outdated software.\n\nThe good: long battery life, nice keyboard, fun to use. When it's not frozen or glitching, a nice experience!"}

If you try to have too many tabs open, it'll freeze. Or you use it too long at one setting. Freeze. It has a huge problem with not always starting. Or being on but having a blank screen. The worst, is that it will force turn off the wifi. It will be impossible for you to turn it on. Sometimes a restart will fix this and other times it won't. Sometimes a hard restart is needed. Even then, wifi only allows connection intermittently. I just did a powerwash and am hoping and praying this fixes it. I have spent many hours dealing with these problems and zero hours with problems on our other chromebooks (one of which is three years old). Don't buy this model."}

Your computer will either start to lag very badly, or will just abruptly restart itself even if you're in the middle of an important task.  It's okay for what it is, but I will definitely upgrade to something with more memory when it's time to replace this one.

It keeps a charge for a long time, the screen is beautifully clear and easy to read, the 11\" size more than adequate. I had wondered if the keyboard would feel small, but it's very generous.

The volume also goes all the time, and I need to shut it down completely, before the sound comes back.  I like the compact design and how light it is and it's convenient.  However, it is frustrating how it stops running almost on a daily basis (I get a window that says \"aw snap\".  It's disappointing. What is also disappointing is Acer's customer service.  I have done everything they have walked me through (spending several hours on the phone with them) in connection with reinstalling the hardware and cleaning it, etc. and the laptop is still doing the same thing, however, they do NOT replace or refund even though it is under warranty and only 7 months' old.  I would never buy this brand again!!!"}

The laptop is well made, the screws all have metal inserts and are coated in blue loctite with a washer. The rubber that the laptop sits on is reinforced with magnets or metal. Does not seem user upgrade-able whatsoever (unless you want to put linux).\n\nI use the laptop for college, mostly google sheets and some google docs. I can use the word app off the app store if I wanted that format. I access Pearson MyMathLab with the laptop to do work. Opening a 1200 page calculus PDF file will lag ONLY when you use the scroll function on the right side to skip over 50 pages, but using bookmark function doesn't lag at all. For any CAD work and gaming I have a home PC, for everything else this is perfect. Also has performed decent for programming, but usually these classes provide you a computer to work on in-class which is much better.\n\nA tip, if you buy it and want to drag and drop stuff, go into settings > manage accessibility features > mouse and touchpad settings >  turn ON tap to drag\n\nP.S. The OS has never crashed for me, so remember to turn it off occasionally and restart or you might get funky issues."}

I received it promptly, and gave it to my daughter as a gift. She started laughing when she opened it and asked if it was a joke; there was a prior return slip still in th box with the computer! So obviously Amazon did not even look at the retuned/damaged product before shipping it out to me. I was so embarrassed. She went on to test out the Chrome Book only to discover that it was indeed broken, the right click did not work. So instead of giving my daughter a memorable gift in a good way; I will always be remembered as giving her the Chrome Book with the return slip already in it. Thank you for ruining a special day because you don't look at the items that get returned. When I returned it, I included the previous slip too. Hopefully no one gives a gift with 2 return labels."}

I found this Chromebook for under $200 and I thought it would be perfect to check personal emails, pay bills, online shopping, the usual stuff while away from home.  At first I really liked the Chromebook.  It took some adjustments to get accustom to Google Sheets and Docs instead of the Microsoft Office Suite products I have used all my life.  The Chrome browser took some getting used to as I have been a Firefox user for a long time.  But lately I have really started getting frustrated with the Chromebook.  It started when I discovered there is no driver available for my Epson printer to work with the Chromebook.  It is just a standard, run-of-the-mill Epson printer.  I had to use a cloud service to be able to print.  But it is print only, I can no longer scan.  That really sucks.  Another issue, I have started looking for another house to buy and as I am scrolling through houses on Zillow the Chromebook doesn't seem to work well with that website.  It will often \"stall out\" and the refresh circle keeps spinning which means I have to close out the window and start over again.  I really don't try to do anything unusual with the laptop.  I'm not asking it to run heavy graphics, I don't do any downloading, just the typical websites everyone uses.  This machine really lacks in performance."}

When I first logged into my account, it set off a continuous crashing cycle that made it impossible to do anything.  Then, because guest logins weren't given admin privileges, even though I could somewhat access the internet and some chrome features, I couldn't actually change anything.\n\nBased on some online discussion threads, I powerwashed the chromebook (reset it completely to the starting conditions) and created a new google login to try to access admin settings.  But checking for updates to Chrome OS showed that a terribly out-of-date version of the OS was allegedly up to date.  And no amount of changing around my sync settings or extensions fixed the issue.\n\nI finally got Acer support, and they informed me I would need to use the Chrome recovery process, where I would create a new OS install file on a flash drive and use it to manually force an updated version onto my machine.  But, of course, my Chromebook by default didn't recognize my first USB stick because it registered as an external hard drive rather than removable storage!  So after spending 2 hours attempting to get the flash drive to work, I finally switched to a second flash drive and it finally worked.\n\nAt this point I have wasted ~5 hours attempting to get even minimal functionality out of this device which is supposed to be reputed for its simplicity and streamlined user experience.\n\nI would recommend looking for a different option if you want a chromebook that's usable out of the box."}

This little Acer  is everything I need and more. I am a teacher, university student, blogger, online shopper, and spend a normal time on social media.  I have watched Chromebooks being used in classrooms for a few years, and see how they are far superior to iPads in class.\nThee speed of this computer and capacity of it's operating system make. it comparable to any laptop for my computing needs.\nIt takes about two minutes to plug in and go.  It is lightweight, so great for laptop use, since my other was heavy and hot.\nI prefer this to an iPad, laptop or cellphone. For desk work in a restaurant this is perfect.  There are times I still prefer a desktop computer, but I will not ever have another desktop at home.  This is sufficient!\nIt has a drive insert for your WORD docs and other storage and opens them immediately.  You do not need to add any other software.\nEverything is linked to your google account and google drive.  Since I have already been using Google Drive for all my documents and slide shows, I did not have to relearn anything.  All storage is in the cloud, but you can store onto an external jump drive.  If you are totally committed to the Microsoft name, and Microsoft Office Suite, you will need to learn to use Google.\nI should have bought this a long time ago!  I'm a convert!\n\n1 month update:  I LOVE MY CHROMEBOOK!  I prefer it to my handheld when I'm at home due to it's large, clear screen, light weight and cool unit, and ease of keyboard.\n\nThere is a learning curve on how to use the WORD app that is available for free.  Also for opening and editing WORD docs that are on a hard drive.  Since I was already familiar with the GoogleDocs platform, I'm getting used to the switch, BUT there is a learning curve, and can be frustrating, if you need something fast.  Still giving it 5 STARS. One of the best electronic purchases in my life.\n\n5 month update.  I STILL love my Chromebook.  I love how light it is, and that I can shove it quickly and easily into my purse and not feel like I'm lugging a traditional laptop around.\nI am going to downgrade my original review to 4 stars because it is not able to handle the type of work I am doing right now for my job.\nAs a teacher, I am researching a lot of pdf's and student worksheets to download and print.\nDownloading and printing from the web is more complicated and time consuming on my Chromebook, than on a laptop.\nI don't like how the Chromebook handles downloads in a download file.  It requires me to save it before printing, and I really don't want to save it.  Other than that, I have played some simple online games, and it works super well for these.\n\nWhen I am web browsing, it loads up my tabs on top so I end up having so many tabs open, until it finally maxes out.  It's just easier to turn it off and start fresh, than to attempt to open each tab to close it.\n\nStill the best deal for your daily internet, social media, word processing, and document storage and retrieval available.

For a while I never really needed a laptop of my own until recently when I was faced with finding new employment. I knew I needed something that is simple and just gets the job done without any unnecessary extras. This laptop is perfect for submitting job applications, web searching, and checking emails... and it's a great price."}

However, after about a year of use I noticed that the wifi-range was *significantly* reduced, and performance began to worsen to the point that there would be sudden freezes/crashes. I love this thing, but I'm afraid it doesn't last long.\n\nUltimately, design and functionality is a solid 5/5.\nDurability is a 2/5, which causes me to reduce the rating down to a three."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "I bought this for the touch screen because my typical carry-around device is a Kindle Fire tablet, and since I was looking for another portable device with a little more functionality, like a physical keyboard, the Acer checked all the right boxes.  I bought the Amazon basics neoprene sleeve and now this thing goes with me everywhere, and now more often than not I use it at home for basic web tasks and Google docs.  In fact, since I have purchased this device I have migrated almost everything of value to Google Drive, and i am about a month away from being done with MSFT forever.  I might prefer a larger screen, but that would impact portability, and even though my home work station is 2X \"27\" ASUS monitors with a 32\" Samsung side-car I can still get a lot done on this machine, mainly because the screen is large enough to see a full browser and because touch allows me to quickly resize windows in a way I can't do on my monitors.\n\nMy only complaint is the power cord, it's 90 degree 2-3mm thing that automatically makes the cord harder to deal with because it wants to rotate, and whenever it's plugged in and my dog walks by I can see how easy it would be for that thing to just snap off, or yank the computer to the ground whereas a straight plug would just release without damage.  Another problem is that the bend creates kinks, making the jack want to rotate, and when it does it impinges on BOTH USB ports on the left side.  I can understand why they may need to put the power supply port in that location to save cost, but the 90 degree bend as opposed to a straight pin just seems like a design flaw.  I suppose there is another power supply available you can buy to replace this, and maybe they already fixed it, but as it stinks."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "I love my Acer Chromebook! I bought it so I could keep up with my students who all have similar Chromebooks. It has been wonderful to use with Google Classroom and all of the Google office products we use in my English classes. I have also been able to learn some cool shortcuts and tricks from my students and show them a few too.\n\nIf given the choice, I would rather use my Chromebook than any other device I own: laptop or Ipad. It is so fast and works way better with all of the Google tools out there. I was worried about not being able to work off-line, but you can use many Google products off-line, like Docs.\n\nThere atre some great extensions out there for educators and they all help me to comment and assess my students' work. I have found that to be more meaningful for my students and their progress in class.\n\nThe only downside to my Chromebook is that it does not run Java. Unfortunately, my online gradebook uses Java and I have to do that on a laptop.  But, since I use Classroom to grade my students' work, I can use both devices and get it done quickly."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "Bought it about 1.5 years ago.  Loved it at first.  Fast, light, it was a joy to surf the web.  If that's ALL you want to do, you'll love it.\n\nI mostly use this just to web browse, but occasionally I need it to do other things.  Here's where the problems begin.\n\n1. Remote access. Loved this feature where I could use the chromebook to access my regular computer. Except it caused my chromebook to freeze REPEATEDLY.  Even when I wasn't using remote access.  That was the first time I experienced freezing (but not the last) and happened very early on.  I no longer use the remote access feature, although the chromebook still freezes (read on).\n\n2.  Playing Pandora causes freezing.  So I don't visit the Pandora site anymore.\n\n3. Google Drive causes freezing, particularly Google Sheets.\n\nAre you noticing a trend? Almost everything causes this thing to freeze!  I don't mean it freezes every single time I use the above, but quite often.  And sometimes I'm not using any of the above and it still freezes!  Sometimes certain webpages make it freeze.\n\nLatest problem which just started happening a few days ago:  I can't print!  Had no problem attaching a cloud HP printer and have used this baby to print hundreds of times.  Suddenly, page previews will not load when hitting the Print command.  And because the previews won't load, the pages print blank.\n\nEven before the above started happening, I would get this stupid popup about adding a cloud printer every time I went to print something.  I already have a cloud printer!  Nevertheless, every single freaking time, a popup window would open when I wanted to print, which I would then have to close before it proceeded to print.\n\nThis thing is getting more and more useless.  Really starting to hate it.  Definitely not worth the price and would not recommend."}

I only find that this happens when I'm browsing the internet, and 100% of the time so far it has saved my files for me upon logging back on. It is medium sized.

I love that my Chromebook feels like my \"Google Drive machine\". During senior year in college, I've really gotten some great use out of this computer. I've made a pros and cons list below.\n\nPros:\nBattery life - It lasts longer than any other laptop I've used or my friends/family have used\nLight weight - Fits perfectly into my backpack and I'm able to carry it around all day without any problems\nDurability - I've dropped this a couple times (from short distances (1-2 feet) and can recognize no issues or cosmetic problems\n\nCons:\nPerformance - Sometimes, I can't have more than 2 tabs open before the computer locks up and shuts itself down. It is, without a doubt, the most maddening issued I've experienced with this computer.\nScreen - The display of the screen feels harsh, even with the brightness turned down. I feel like my eyes strain too much when reading off of it.\n\nOverall, this Chomebook just feels \"okay\" to me. It certainly does the job and allows me to edit any of my Google docs and use the internet. However, with the glaring performance issue of frequently crashing (usually at least once every time I use the computer), I will not be a repeat customer of the Chromebook. That isn't to say it's trash - I will certainly still be using it until it becomes no longer necessary to or obsolete. And, for the money, it's a great buy. It's just that I didn't expect it to be so sluggish when using the internet and, in the future, I'd like something that could handle a little more."}

Not only is it super cute, unlike every other pc laptop, it actually WORKS LOL... the wifi turns on no matter where you go, you don't have to go into network settings and mess with the settings like Microsoft products -- it can't get viruses like other PCS, it doesn't give you any pop-up windows like all of the other pcs because they ship with all of this other junky software on them that you can't ever uninstall. I mean, honestly, it is literally everything you need, it is perfect! And, you can't beat the price! Nobody even uses Microsoft docs anymore from their desktop, everyone works on the cloud so, you really can access anything from the cloud with this. I think everyone should get a Chromebook and toss their pcs out to the trash!"}

So far this laptop has done a pretty great job of doing just that, although it isn't perfect.\n\nThe Pros:\n-Even with my slower internet connection the Acer Chromebook is very quick to load web pages or videos\n-The keyboard is a regular size (minus the number pad) and feels very nice to type on. The keys are sensitive, but not too sensitive.\n-I specifically wanted a Chromebook to avoid Windows and Mac, so if that's what you're looking for this will be great.\n-The battery life is excellent\n-It's lightweight and feels sturdy (although I haven't dropped it or spilled anything on it yet)\n\nThe Cons:\n-About once a day the computer freezes and shuts down all my tabs. It's easy to restore and I've tried to troubleshoot some things, but it still struggles at least once a day, which is incredibly annoying.\n-It took me a bit to realize that in place of the caps lock is a search tool, you can change this so it stays a caps lock, but it confused me at first.\n\nMy only complaint really about this computer is the constant freezing, but I wonder if I just have a dud or it was beaten around a little during transport. Hard to say. Overall, I would definitely recommend if you need an affordable, but good laptop."}

She has been dying for a Chromebook for a while and I got her one. She has only had it for 1 and a half days and she loves it! She has been using it a lot. Since she had a Gmail account this was perfect and easy to make an account, and she even made a Gmail account for her sister and let her have an account on her laptop! I would call that sister bonding, when we(my wife and I) went out for a while (4 hours) and left them home with their grandmother, we came back to see them laying down together watching YouTube. Overall this is a great laptop and we love it!\n\nEdit, about 8 months later\nMy daughter loved it, but 3 dogs doesn't mix well with a not very sturdy Chromebook. The 3 pugs, each took a hit at the Chromebook. One doing it accidentally, just wanted under the covers and ripped open a side of it. It was still usable, though damaged, which was annoying. The other 2 just got their punch. My daughter, not wanting to put the laptop down, helped one up onto our bed. The one started fighting the pug she had just helped up. They jumped across the laptop, knocking it off the opposite hinge. I wouldn't say it didn't hold up, it just doesn't hold up to dogs."}

Well despite feeling great physically, the keyboard is awesome...and looking great, the screen's resolution is bright and crisp, that's about where the pluses end. I don't know what these other people are reviewing but I think we are talking about different things. This thing was designed for one thing, internet browsing. And it fails, all day every day. It's no use opening more than five tabs, it can't handle it, especially if one of those tabs contains video or audio. I am constantly holding down the power button. I thought these days of my life were over but I guess not.\n\nIn this case, you get what you pay for. And it's WAY too good to be true.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "I've had this Chromebook for a few months, and it does exactly what I need it to do.  It starts up fast, all the components work as expected, the battery life is great, and it is incredibly durable and transportable.  The camera and sound are surprisingly good. It does struggle to run some basic apps or multiple browsing tabs.  Facebook and Hulu together, for example, shuts it right down.  Skype shuts down a lot.  But that's in the nature of the machine.  You just take one second to restart (Chrome will remember which tabs you had open) and don't run too many programs at once.  Be aware that Chromebook apps are often limited in scope at this time.  You may be surprised at which basic functions are tricky, such as recording a video or cropping a picture.  But if you're creative and know how to read a support forum, you'll figure it out.  If you travel a lot, worry about having an expensive computer due to a lot of rough handling, and love Google Drive, this is a great option at an unbeatable price.  It does handle multiple Google accounts just fine."}

I get it, this is a budget web machine, it's not meant to do heavy workloads. But WHY ON EARTH would you release a web machine that can't even support a handful of pinned email tabs, a few google searches, Spotify, and Google Docs. I don't remember older Chromebooks having an issue this severe.\n\nIn fact, I shouldn't be having to wait through stutters while typing this review.

For this type of user, this device is perfect.\n\nThe only drawback is that you can only print to printers that have google print service. Otherwise, there is no print function."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "I'm not sure why this particular model doesn't have any reviews. I'm assuming it's because people usually go with the 2gb model. Well, I tried that 2gb model and I lovingly refer to it as \"the grandma model.\" It's fine for very basic internet surfing, but I found it to be sluggish compared to this 4gb one. I immediately returned the 2gb model after two days of using for this 4gb one. After a week of using this model, I can easily say that I love it.\n\nMy main purpose for getting a chromebook was to use writerduet, a screenwriting program, on it. When I downloaded the writerduet extension on the 2gb, I found it took quite a while for it to load. If I had a couple of tabs open and tried to open the writerduet extension as well, I felt the experience was quite sluggish. On this 4gb model, I felt the loading time for the extension was cut in half. Maybe more! I can have a couple of tabs open along with the writerduet extension and not experience any lag. It's great.\n\nEven if you're not looking to use that particular extension, I'm sure this chromebook will suit your needs if you're planning to do some multitasking on it. I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap means to go online and use browser based software.\n\nThe battery life is great. Most of the information online promise 9 hours of battery life, which you do get, but if you don't stream videos and just do word processing and surfing, you can definitely pump out around 12 hours of battery life. It's very impressive. the screen isn't the most miraculous display you'll lay your eyes on, but it's very much serviceable. I enjoy using it for youtube, netflix, and hulu (oh, and amazon streaming, too. Sorry, amazon.) The build of the chromebook is very nice. It's very lightweight and portable. That was definitely a plus for me because I hate lugging around my 15\" windows laptop. It looks great and the keys do not feel mushy like on other models I've checked out. I can see myself typing on this one for hours.\n\nJust be sure you know what you're getting into when getting a chromebook. There are some great videos on youtube explaining what a chromebook is compared to a mac and pc. If you know what you're getting into, this is definitely a solid purchase."}

Such great products, so we decided to upgrade to more RAM and a touch screen. The R11 is the same body as this Chromebook, just a couple more features. Still can't believe the price!\n\nI bought this as a surprise for my wife since she needs a computer for her work. She needs something to do general things such as using the internet browser, emails, and the photo editing apps that are available on the chromeos. I honestly can't believe how much is packed into this little thing. My go-to is a surface pro 3 for school which I use all the time, and the keyboard alone for my surface was $130!\n\n The Acer Chromebook is durable, good-sound (my wife is watching a movie on it right now), the speed is non-laggy while using it (unless you overload it with a lot of stuff - but that's what more expensive computers are for), and overall it was blown my expectations out of the water. I was a bit nervous about the lack of ram, only 2 gigs, compared to 4 gigs for a few more bucks on other chromebooks. But, there weren't any other white ones (as crazy as it sounds) and it hasn't disappointed at all. My main hope was for her to use it for the internet with her new job, but she will be able to use it more than just that. She loves the white too! It was available on Prime Now, which came very soon after ordering. Can't beat that.\n\nI'm a big fan of the Chromebooks now, and am excited to get one for myself one day. Go google!"}

I'm a Sophomore in college and I use it just for YouTube, Netflix, and Google Chrome. It's just perfect for me. I absolutely love it. It's even lighter than my iPhone with it's case. Since there's no a whole lot of space on the computer itself, it forces you to keep it clean, thus keeping it running faster which is a big thing for me in class when I'm taking notes and looking things up.\n\nI do still keep my old laptop to use with my printer and to keep most of my files on for now. But I can see myself in the future using a desktop and having a Chromebook for travel. They're cheap enough to replace if it gets broken rather than keeping a laptop for everything.\n\nThe ONLY thing that upsets me about it is there is no caps lock key, it's replaced by a search key for your files and Chrome apps.

It's really a great no messing around work laptop with the seamless integration of google services which is truly time saving.\nOccasionally I have had issues getting the chromebook to turn on after using it even though the battery was charged. Letting it sit for a while on the charger usually helps though.\nIf you're a mac lover or PC lover and not super technical or willing to learn a new system (which is actually simpler than the other two) but has less capabilities and customizability, then you may want to research this product further.\nIt is super lightweight and has an attractive construction and white finish made of a very durable plastic. The battery life is also pretty remarkable as is the speed considering the size. Great for students or electronic repair shops or other places that need a dedicated employee computer which can be moved around and take a bit of a beating.\nWould buy again especially considering the price point. In love with the trackpad and keyboard, but there is no caps lock, rather a google chrome browser search I. It's place.

I don't run on battery that much, but it looks like it would last all day from the few hours I have been on battewry.\n\nCons:\n1. Won't exchange files with other bluetooth devices.\n2. Need 3rd party app to see network PCs and NASs.\n3. Instruction manual neglects to mention to hold down search key and hit number to get a Function key. Chrome uses Function keys heavily, so one would think a Chromebook would have easy access to them.\n4. It needs Home and End keys\n5. It's the slowest device on my wireless network.\n6.

I've tried to get help from them twice and both times were disasters. Today their rep, Mateo A clearly didn't want to work or help so he kept telling me to do a factory reset. I did NOT and a few hours later the problem I had been having seems to have self resolved. Mateo A also gave me instructions that he had to have known would disconnect me from the net for a few seconds, yet he ended our chat immediately because I had been \"idle\" for a while. When I found him again, it was clear to me that Mateo A had no intention of helping me at all. I will NEVER by an ACER product again, and probably never buy a Chromebook again either since neither of them impressed me positively."}

There is a word processing program included and you can send print jobs to a printer through Bluetooth, so you can borrow someone else's (if you know someone who owns one), and the web store includes a few not-so-great games.  But, be aware that you can't play any games that run on Windows, which, sadly, means the good games.  Although, you can play some games on Facebook.  I am definitely not sorry I got it, even though I mainly got it to play the games I had previously purchased off of Big Fish Games, but it is perfect for keeping in touch with family and friends through email and Facebook.  That was the most important thing I needed, though.  So, although I wouldn't say it has \"everthing I need,\" I will say that for the price, it is a pretty good deal."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "ALL chromebooks have two finger scrolling HARDWIRED into the trackpad. This means that any contact, no matter how casual, with a second hand, thumb, finger, will cause your screen to scroll either up and down or left to right, or right to left. This happens ALL THE TIME when playing simple games or navigating the internet. Google has NO FIX, and apparently does not care. In fact it has disabled all the previous cures and workarounds for this problem. So unless you like one handed computer operation, or figure out how to retrain your hands so only one finger (and nothing else) ever touches your trackpad, do yourself a BIG favor and buy a cheap microsoft computer and configure it to operate on chrome. It will save you a lot of pain."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "Chromebooks are a quickly rising computer type, that one should consider if they're looking for a basic computer to browse the web on. I really have liked using this to do some more basic homework on over the past few months, it should be said that if you plan on opening lots of more intensive browser windows (like lots of youtube at the same time, and a facebook video), the chromebook will crash. Because it has such low RAM, it's pretty easy to stagger this computer. Sometimes you won't know why, and it'll just reboot. Luckily this is rarely a problem as most things auto save and the computer starts up very quickly, it's only a minor inconvenience.\n\nThat being said, this is a cute little laptop that is great if you want something to just throw in your back pack and carry around without stressing about an expensive laptop. Also, with programs like teamviewer and chrome remote desktop, one can easily stream their home computer to their chromebook to do more technical things, I use it to program mostly, but once I even got Portal 2 to run through steam at about 27 fps, although the mouse didn't work through the connection.\n\nI cannot recommend getting this laptop though if you can wait a few months, as of my writing this, Google is working with a few other companies, namely samsung, to integrate android apps better with chromebooks, and in general to greatly improve them on the whole, so if you can wait and don't mind spending another 100 dollars, I would recommend that, or wait and this will be even cheaper."}

I bought the older model 1 year ago, which has the exact same specs as this laptop but just has a crummier looking casing. I don't like to usually leave reviews for products unless I stand behind them with my full support, and by god this laptop has done it. I have had laptops from as cheap as $300 all the way to laptops up in the $2500 spot, and nothing has performed as smoothly and RELIABLY as this little baby. The battery lasts around 14 hours when I keep it on low brightness (which is most of the time), the screen quality is clear as long as it's not in direct sunlight, the keyboard and mouse are comfortable, and the speakers are loud enough to hold a small party. Not kidding, I had a few friends over and we didn't even need to go hunting for a speaker to attach. I threw Gallium OS on mine, although Chrome OS should be enough for most users. If you're a developer, the Linux install works great and runs all my C, C++, Python, Java, and C# scripts no problem. Webcam quality is pretty decent, and the microphone had no issues. Hell, I used this thing as a frisbee a few times jokingly with friends and it still works fine, after hitting walls and being dropper a lot. With every laptop I've had I could give you at least 10 complaints by the end of the month, but this laptop has performed above and well beyond expectations. For $107, I bought it at a steal, but I would gladly pay $200 for the same quality."}

Thankfully Amazon sent me a replacement within a day of me calling them for one (on the last day of my warrant, mind you). The issue stemmed from the wireless card, not a software issue, which made my chromebook unable to recognize any networks in the vicinity, aka making it worthless. When it works, it works very well, however. It handles everything phenomenally: multiple tabs open at once, videos running, music playing, all without a problem. The display is also really nice to look at and provides a wonderful color pallet. The material feels very nice, not necessarily cheap, and the back of the screen has a really cool design and feel to it. Keyboard feels great as well, Sometimes I actually prefer using it over my desktop's mechanical. Overall, I'm pretty happy with my chromebook, but at the same fearful it'll go bad every single day."}

I solved the issue by getting a wireless mouse, my kids need to learn to use the mouse for school anyway, so not a big deal. I realized after we got them that Chromebooks don't have a lot of parental controls built in.  I overlooked that in my research, assuming they had good controls because they were used at school.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "I've bought two chromebooks in the past few months - this one, and a Lenovo Ideapad 100s. This one seems so much better than the Lenovo in several key ways - the screen is massively better with improved color and viewing angles, it's thinner, and it's a little bit lighter. I prefer the design of the Acer more as well.\n\nPretty much the only noticeable area where the Lenovo outshines this is the touchpad; the Lenovo has a slightly more solid feel to it, while the Acer's touchpad wiggles a tiny bit vertically under light touch. This isn't a usability problem per se, as it doesn't affect actual touchpad gestures - it reflects more on build quality than anything else.\n\nIs it perfect? No, but it's remarkable what $ ~160 will get you in laptops these days. Great for browsing things on the internet, but won't replace my larger, higher-powered work laptop for more advanced / power user functionality."}

This laptop is for my niece in Mexico who is in elementary and you know how kids get when one of their friends gets a laptop or anything honestly.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "The device itself is excellent. The problem is with the charger. I do not know the correct terminology but bear with me. The adapter that plugs into the left side of the machine has a metal pin. If you are charging the machine while watching, as I had done, and you accidentally tap, and I do mean TAP, that pin...it will bend. It is extremely thin and frail and brittle. Now that it's bent, you reinsert it into the machine. But it might not charge. So you have to wiggle it around until you see the little lightning bolt inside the battery indicating that it's charging. But then it stops. If you wiggle it again....and again....ever so gently even, the casing around the pin breaks off into the machine. So now you have a thin pin that you can reinsert and  move around, ever so gently, until that one breaks. I have broken 2 adapters so far. The company is sending me a new one. ADVICE: Put the machine, while charging, in a place where nothing and nobody can get near it. Then very gingerly unplug the charger and put it in some sort of padded safe place until you need to recharge. Maybe on a little featherbed in a cast iron safe. The company seriously needs to redesign that fatal flaw."}

I deeply dislike this replacement - a SSD makes no sense in a Chromebook were the memory needs to be dynamic. My computer consistently freezes when I am loading more than 3 webpages at a time.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "I love this little laptop!!  As long as you know what you are buying it is awesome.  As most may know, a Chromebook is not a Windows machine.  And frankly I couldn't have a Chromebook as my main or only computer. With a Chromebook, you can't load and run software on it.  It pretty much is for working on the web, which for me is about 90% of what I do.  The main thing I don't like about working \"online only\" is when it comes to using Office products.  Many Chromebook users use Google versions of Office applications, however, I've not adopted that approach.  I use Office Online apps like Excel and Word, then save the files to my OneDrive which for the most part is fine...kind of.  I'm not here to review Office 360, but if the online version of Office was a little better I would love my Chromebook even more.\n\nWith that said, I find myself using my little Acer Chromebook all the time.  Don't want to sit at my desktop?  Great! I can chill at my couch with this machine.  Even if you do want to use your \"main\" home machine, Chrome has a web app that allows you to log on to your main machine from your Chromebook.  Your Chromebook then mirrors the other machine just like you are working on that machine.\n\nThis Chromebook is so light and portable I often use it in the kitchen to pull up recipes while I'm cooking, I take it on trips for video streaming at hotels.  Also, it works great for Southwest Airlines on-board TV.  You can now download movies from Google Play onto this machine for offline viewing, but there isn't much storage capacity on the SS hard drive (pretty much one movie's worth.)  I have also used this machine's HDMI output for streaming video and connecting to my main home television.  Here, the quality isn't as great as something like Roku, but it is OK if you need to catch up on a few episodes directly from some TV network's website.  BTW, you can also mirror your Chromebook screen to your TV via HDMI which seems to work and look great.\n\nI haven't used the built in camera very much on this, but it appears a bit grainy.  This leads to one of the Chromebook's drawbacks.  I don't believe there is a way to Skype (video) on this which is too bad.  There are other Google web apps I believe you can use instead but I've not tried.\n\nWhile this Acer Chromebook maybe isn't a isn't a solid 5-stars for me, it is definitely 4.5.  I say this because of the following:\n\n- Outstanding battery life\n- It works great (quick start)\n- Very reasonable price if you are looking for a second computer\n- Light, attractive, and pretty solid feeling build with aluminum external shell\n- Versatility: I've had this for about 9 months and continue find new things I can do on it."}

Chromebooks are just internet machines, but they have a keyboard, which I prefer for entering information over a touchscreen.\n\nThe first computer I bought was a windows 98 machine that cost $1500 almost 20 years ago. Now they're disposable. What a country.\n\nThe thing that is a problem here is that there's not enough memory on this one. It freezes up with only a couple of tabs open, and I have to restart it. Maybe I have too much running concurrently with chrome, but that's a pain in the rear. I like the white color, but it picks up grime."}

I have been on the phone with Acer two more times and representatives indicated that they were emailing a shipping label which I have to give up to 48 hours to receive.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "Even as a product that sold only for 180$ (the price when I bought), I still don't think it is well worth the money. It lacks the most important, a smooth experience while using.\nProblem 1: The tabs froze and crash too frequently, probably because of the minuscule 2GB RAM, it always tell me it has run out of memory, even when I'm just opening 4 tabs. Videos consume a lot of RAM, open 2 youtube videos at the same time, you'll start notice the lag.\nProblem 2: It's not just the tabs froze, the Chromebook occasionally froze and my only option is to restart it, or it'll restart by itself anyway after a while.\n\nHowever, the IPS screen is great. The keyboard is also very comfortable to type. I got a new xps 13 after using this for 2 months. After the keyboard on xps 13 (which is considered to be a premium ultrabook), I still somehow prefer the keyboard on this chromebook. The key travel distance on this chromebook is larger and it's easy to distinguish each keys from another just from touching it. The build quality is also not bad, the plastic feels sturdy enough to withstand bumpy ride in my backpack.\n\nPerhaps if acer manage to bump up the RAM on this to 3gb or 4gb, it would be a much more pleasant experience. I made this purchase with an idea that it would handle my daily task such as browsing and watching videos without problem, which it didn't handle well. (side note: it doesn't handle 1080p well, which is expected anyway)\nI'll give it a 3.5/5."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "For its relatively low and affordable price, this is actually a really good laptop, whether you're a student or not! I've been using my first Chromebook for about five months now, and this actually comes quite in handy, you can easily browse the Internet, check your email, and easily work on and finish most of your assignments as needed! This is best for people who frequently use Google's apps and programs, such as its Drive, it is able to boot up extremely quickly, and it usually has a very long battery life.\n\nTo be fair, it does seem to freeze and crash a lot, though, much more than my previous non-Chrome laptop, probably because sometimes I have too many tabs open, so just know that its memory is probably not the greatest. But still, I recommend you at least giving it a try, because in my opinion it is well worth your time and money."}

After my last laptop got hacked, it was going to be too expensive to get it cleaned out, and take too long, so I had to choose something else very quickly. I required a laptop that would be lightweight and easy to carry (long term shoulder injury), that would be pretty inexpensive - yes, we get what we pay for, absolutely, and if I had some disposable income I'd have gone for something around the $300-450 price range, but I don't - and I only need it for writing (love google docs), e-mailing and Internet. I don't use it for games, music or movies - I use my phone and tablet for those things. The Acer Chromebook seemed to fit the bill.\nIt is lightweight and easy to carry around. It powers up quickly and is easy to navigate. Honestly, it works well for everything I need so far.\n\nThe negatives:\n1/ Everything is stored on line - literally everything - nothing is downloaded onto the Chromebook and this is something I miss. I thought I would be fine with that, and I most likely will, but I'm still having to get used to it - I liked the convenience of keeping icons on my home screen, but now I can only 'bookmark' webpages instead.\n\n2/ The screen doesn't scroll like my last one did and I thought I wouldn't miss that, but at the moment I do.\n\nThese two things I knew about before buying it and aren't something I feel are too bad, just something I'm not yet 100% comfortable with. This is a 'me' thing, not a laptop thing.\n\nBut this is a Chromebook 'thing' -\n3/ The pad makes quite a 'clunking' noise when I press down to either right or left click. It is actually quite noticeable and quite annoying, so I googled it and it seems that most people find this an issue with this particular model. Some people have posted how to take the back off and fix it themselves, but I'm in no way handy and won't be trying that myself! People nearby me when I'm using it say that they don't notice the clicking sound and that their laptop does it too (not sure about that!). I wish it didn't do this, but I'll learn to live with it, I'm sure.\n\nIf I get a couple of years use out of this, I'll be very satisfied, at which time I may well want to upgrade."}

On my last Acer Chromebook, you could easily have 10 tabs open before you would see any issues with performance and it never froze  I had each of my last 2 Acers for a few years.  I would be surprised if this one lasts 6 months.  Something is well off the high standard of the last versions. I bought this one blindly out of loyalty to the past results I had with Acer.

The screen is 720p but the built in google chrome allows for 1080p to my tv. The product does not come with a lot of memory but if your streaming this is not an issue or if your like me just buy a WD Mybook and it's no longer an issue. This laptop does not use traditional software. Good side no viruses or adds safe from malware if your being safe with chrome OS. Bad side if you need to install other traditional programs if it's not in the google store your not using it on this laptop. Example iTunes!!! I found I didn't need them I can still back up my cellphone on the laptop with the external hard drive. Big pluses start time, multiple languages, easy to use for any level of experience.

All she does is email and browse a few different websites so this was perfect for her. Built in security makes it safe for someone of her age and lack of technological ability. I created a gmail account for her and it's so easy to use. It boots up very fast, and all she has to do is login and it brings her straight to her gmail which is perfect. Easy to browse the Internet and she just loves the touch pad, which is also one large button. You can either tap or push the actual button. She no longer gets confused with the right and left click buttons, and the touch pad is not nearly as sensitive as a windows pc, where we had to disable it because she kept tapping on stuff. Even at her age she wanted a smaller computer, her previous windows of was a 17\" and she just LOVED this smaller size. The screen is very nice and easy to see even at her age. Very light and compact as well. I'd recommend this for anyone, but it is especially nice for elderly folks who just like to browse the Internet and do email."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "A moderately fast, very small and lightweight netbook. I find Chromium to be a very accessible OS, even though it can't hold a candle to Windows in terms of options. Just a note about this computer: I got the 2GB RAM model, and it has trouble running for long periods of time, particularly because Chrome itself is so RAM-heavy. Often the Chromebook will freeze up and crash, being unresponsive for 5-10 minutes. It's quite annoying, and the offline tools frequently won't work, like Docs or the Drive extension for Chrome (which means you can't copy or paste until you redownload it, every time the computer restarts). When it works, however, it's really great.\n\nUltimately, I feel like I should have invested in a slightly better Chromebook, but I don't consider this one a waste of money."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "Got this for my 11 y/o son. He uses Chrombooks at school and has the school google account. So this was a no brainer. He can access his class work at home without having to worry about either an expensive PC or a cheaper (heavy) PC running windows. The thing is really lightweight and he also uses it for browsing, utube and other games/streaming.\nyes the screen is not top of the range, no it has no touch - but its not needed for such a device. For the price, for what it does its perfect (I've had to replace a screen in a tablet and a windows pc because of my kids - if that happens here, I'll just get another one)."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "Why I purchased: We needed a lap top and quick just for the school year. We don't have a lot of money to be spending, so we decided that something inexpensive like this with good reviews would do the trick.\n\nWhat I love: I love how lightweight it is. It's an awesome deal for the price of only a little bit over $200. Because we don't use it for gaming or downloading, it works perfectly. It basically needs Internet at all times, so luckily we only use it when we have Internet. It's a great value, honestly, especially if you just need a lap top to do some basic work on and don't want to spend a lot of money.\n\nWhat I don't love: While I have been pretty happy with this purchase so far, I've already noticed it starting to bug out. We've had to restart it a few times for no apparent reason. When we purchased this, we missed the fact that you need Internet to basically do anything on it, which means that I wasn't always able to work on the go. These are not deal breakers, but these are the reasons for only four stars. It is stellar for the price you pay, however, so I would seriously recommend this to my college friends who don't want to spend too much money on a lap top.\n\nConclusion: It definitely suits its purpose. It's not the best attribute that it doesn't really work without Internet, but it does its job when you're connected. This means that your computer doesn't slow down with the major taking up of memory, so I kind of like the fact that you save everything onto a \"cloud.\" It's inexpensive, quick, and has had little failures to speak of. Again, I recommend it!"}

I'm brand new to Chromebooks, and after 3 months this is my impression.\n\nWhat I like:\n- Others can log in on my computer using their Gmail addresses and it becomes \"their\" computer and they can't see my files, web history, etc. So you can freely lend your computer to friends, family, etc., to check email or whatever.\n- The computer is small and light.\n- You don't have to worry about the computer getting stolen, since your stuff is on the cloud.\n- Great for web browsing and email.\n- Allows the Dvorak keyboard!\n\nWhat I do not like/what needs to be improved:\n- The file system is mega confusing. I wish they could have it set up in simple folders or directories like Windows and Mac have.\n- The Google Sheets aspect is somewhat broken compared with using Google Sheets on a Mac. For example, it's impossible to open a csv file with a table, reorder the data, and copy 'n paste it all into a Google Sheet on the Chromebook, but it does work on Windows or Mac.\n- The extensions are confusing. I wish there could be a simple list of what extensions you have and what you can use or deactivate. (Maybe there is such a list, but I can't find it.)\n- Supposedly you have access now to Android apps, but it's non-intuitive.\n- No way to adjust screen colors for night mode (removal of blue light), like you can on iPhone, Mac, and Kindle Fire.\n- If you close the lid to put the computer to sleep, sometimes the screen won't turn back on. You have to just turn the thing off and on, rather than putting it to sleep, which makes the process slower."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "I was looking for a compact, inexpensive laptop I could take with me to professional education seminars for my job, as well as carry around the house. After doing some extensive research, I settled on this Chromebook. After using it for a few months, I can recommend this to anyone looking for a ~$150 laptop and/or considering jumping into the Chromebook arena for the first time.\n\nPROS:\n- Super quick startup. Turning on the Chromebook, I can be logged in under a minute.\n- Great battery life. This laptop can last me an entire day at a seminar unplugged (8+ hours of continuous use). My previous laptops would need to be charged after half a day at most.\n- Small and compact. I bought a handheld carrying case to go along with my Chromebook and now it's so much easier to bring my laptop with me places. The days of lugging a laptop in an over-the-shoulder are over!\n- Quick and unintrusive updates.\n- Compatible with my Logitech mouse. I plugged in the USB receiver and I was able to use my wireless mouse immediately.\n- Inexpensive. If this were to break or get lost, it wouldn't be a huge loss. This is also a negative aspect, as you'll see below.\n\nCONS:\n- Inexpensive. Don't expect lightning fast Internet browsing with this Chromebook. Streaming videos can take upwards of 30 seconds to one minute to load. I expected this though when I reviewed the specs and price. For the price, this is fine.\n- Not MS Office compatible. The online version is available, of course, but if you need Word, Excel, etc. look elsewhere. Google's office suite is available though, and this would probably suffice for most people's needs.\n- Wifi Internet only. At home, it would nice to have the option for a wired Internet connection, but this is not an option as far as I'm aware with this Chromebook.\n- Trackpad gestures aren't very intuitive. I had to Google how to right-click with the trackpad. Hitting the right bottom corner of the trackpad with a single finger does not trigger a right-click as I would have expected. You need to use two fingers. That's why I usually use my wireless mouse with this Chromebook.\n\nOverall, I really like this laptop given its price range. Don't buy this laptop expecting it to be a powerhouse. It's perfect for casual Internet browsing and very light office productivity work. If you're looking for an inexpensive laptop or if you're considering buying your first Chromebook but don't want to drop a lot of money on it, this is a great offering. Manage your expectations before purchasing!"}

I only purchased it for internet browsing and watching videos on Youtube and Netflix. It worked perfectly at first, but now it freezes at least twice a day. I haven't installed any apps/third party software on it, and it continues to freeze when I've got just a few chrome tabs open.\nIt's too late for me to return/replace it through the Amazon return policy, so I guess I'm stuck with it. I'm sure it's possible that I simply received a defective device, so who knows, maybe it will work for you, because this machine does have some pros. It's very lightweight, has a nice bright screen, and doesn't get hot like other laptops do. If it weren't for the freezing issues, this would be the perfect device for lightweight browsing and streaming videos."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "This is great for using the internet, checking email, and casting to a Chromecast.  The battery lasts forever and the setup was fast.  It is super lightweight and starts up immediately.  Its is a good size and weight to take around in a small bag or large purse.  I was worried with it being white and having the textured shell, it would get filthy looking really soon, but after a few weeks mine is still looking like new.\nIf you are new to Chromebooks like me, note that you cannot sync Apple products at all and I found that even trying to charge through the USB is impossible.  You also save all files into the Google drive, nothing is local, so if you are wanting to move files from another device to clean it off you basically have to save it up to the Google drive from that device, and then you can view them on this machine.  There are positives to having a Google-dedicated machine because it sort of organizes itself and all your files (like Hal would I guess...) but if you also have Apple products, it is worth considering the annoyance of not being able to charge your phone off of it if you are out and about.  All that said though, I would buy it again."}

Chromebooks certainly are sleek and easy to use, fast startup, thanks to the solid state drive, incredibly lightweight, and a very satisfying battery life. There are a lot of chrome apps now that allow this laptop to function very similarly to Windows. I even found a torrenting app.\n\nUnfortunately, after just a couple weeks of use, I started to hit its upper limits. While it's great for just opening Facebook or YouTube on the go, if you try anything more, especially simultaneously, it really gets bogged down.

Got Crouton running on an SD card and backed up to a USB stick (try to stick with the supported versions . . . had a bit of headaches trying out LXDE and any type of Ubuntu Xenial).  I can always power wash the Chromebook and my settings pop right back into place, with Ubuntu (Trusty) with XFCE on the SD card.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "Background:\nI am a college student who has a computer that is so heavy and cumbersome not to mention the battery life is regularly around 3 hours which is not enough to take it to campus for the day.  I wanted a computer to take on campus so I could do some online homework and surf the web if time allowed, and after that, still had enough battery life so i would be fine if i forgot to charge it at night.  I researched into different chromebooks and i have a friend who has the previous generation of this computer, the Acer Chromebook CB-111.\n\nPrice:\nProbably the main reason that i purchased this chromebook, especially at the price for what you are getting, this is a very nice laptop.\n\nFeel:\nThis laptop is made out of plastic, but not the plastic that you touch and you think you are going to break.  It is a nice matte texture and feels solid to hold.  The feel of the keys is more textured, and coupled with the not-completely-mushy keys, makes this laptop fun to type on.  The trackpad is one of the parts of this laptop where it shows its price; the trackpad is plastic as well, and it is definitely not as nice as glass when it comes to sliding your finger across it.  Your finger is more prone to friction when moving across the trackpad than with a glass trackpad.  This is not something that will bug you until the day that you get rid of the computer, it takes about a day to get used to it, and then you never notice it again.\n\nScreen:\nYou are going to like looking at the screen. since the screen size is smaller, you don't even notice that it isn't full HD.\n\nPerformance:\nThe whole thing about chrome OS is that google built it to be fast, responsive and lightweight. You are not going to be running full Photoshop on this, sure, but that isn't the purpose for this computer. The Chromebook is for someone who is using it for some surfing the web, editing text docs. Perfect for the average college student. That being said, the 2GB of RAM that are in this computer is enough to get you through your day of editing docs, surfing the web and emails.  If you try to have 20 tabs open, all running CPU intensive tasks, yes, the computer is going to stutter.  It would be like four instances of Photoshop on an PC all stitching together panoramas. With the 2GB of RAM, I have been pleasantly surprised with what it can do. I regularly have my email open in one tab, google hangouts in another tab, google keep open, editing a google doc and listening to google play music on the counter and I haven't noticed the computer stuttering with all of those programs running.  If you want to run programs that your PC can run, you can always just remotely access your computer using Chrome Remote Desktop, and then you can access the power of your PC directly from your Chromebook.  Be warned; however, that running Chrome Remote Desktop uses up the battery much faster than just surfing the web.\n\nAll in all:\nLike I have said before, this is perfect for a college student who wants to take notes in class, do their online homework while still on campus, edit their essay and after all that, have their computer be at 50% battery.  A fantastic Chromebook that has just the right amount of everything."}

My camera does not work. Any USB port I've put an external drive into has not worked. Finding applications on the computer is very very difficult and using things like microsoft word require being online and using it by opening google and then going to microsoft word online. This computer has not been incredibly easy to use and the only nice thing I have to say about it is that the internet is fast and the screen is bright. I am unhappy with this computer, and finding troubleshooting support that is actually useful and does something for me has been impossible. Perhaps I got a bad apple out of the bunch. But I am a full time music student taking 14 classes a semester, and do not have time to take my computer to a tech support store, or send my computer back for a replacement, because I need my computer everyday.

Works great for browsing the web (handles multiple tabs like it was nothing), utilizing Google docs, Skype via browser, basic text editing (via an offline program from the google store), and it can handle transfering cumbersome files between external drives (it has 2 USB ports: 1-USB3 & 1-USB2). It so far plays videos well but I have yet to test Netflix on it ir to test it's HDMI out capabilities.\n\nYou have to log-in with your Google sign in but you can add enough privacy plug-ins like ghostery, AdBlockPlus, & EFF's badger to make it feel more locked down/clean. It also has the option to do a full purge of your personal data if you decide to get rid of it.\n\nThe battery life is quite amazing 9 hours fully charged. I tested this both in 1 day and then over several dayssometimes It would go for what felt like a bit longer.\n\nThe screen is matte & reminds me if old-shool laptop screens except you can veiw it from any angle. I have yet to test the webcam out, I currently have a cute privacy sticker on it since I rarely need a webcam.\n\nPrinting is a pain & a halfI'm quite tech savvy (worked in IT for a few years) and I had to call up tech support to get instructions on how to get it to communicate with my Canon printer. For reference my MBP & iPhone connected pretty much automatically to it once I connected the printer to my wifi. There are also extremely limited printing options on the Chromebook once connectedi.e. No B&W or printing multiple pages to a sheet.\n\nI got this to be my travel/beater laptop for my freelance work so I wouldn't have to bring my high-end MBP everywhere and so far it does quite well!"}

The CB3-111 had that issue and Acer fixed it in this model, also this is a chromebook not a laptop! Know what a chromebook is before buying. Chrome OS is a great simple to use web/cloud based system that in my opinion is perfect for 90% of the people out there. the majority of people just browse the web store pictures and music and need nothing more. With an SD card and google drive what more would you need. You can still skype or video chat and for the price, you cannot go wrong.\n\nDID I MENTION 9 HOUR BATTERY!!\n\nAbsolutely a great chromebook for the price!! I bought 3 of these on SALE for $130 each. I Originally only bought one just to play around with as I have always loved the idea of Chrome OS. After using this laptop for only 4 hours (which I mind you barely drained the battery) I went online to order two more for my kids for Christmas. First I will say this Chromebook handled everything I threw at it. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Pandora, Plex Movie stream, Xfininity Video Stream and so much more. Flash and java heavy websites just all seemed to work! I even ran some 4k youtube videos and after buffering they played, but really you do not need 4k when you don't have a 4k screen. The screen on this chrombeook is IPS and looks clean clear and is responsive; much nicer than other chromebooks I've seen. I have had multiple streams video and music open while browsing multiple tabs, but really I would never do this unless testing and it all ran perfectly. This was reported to be the best chromebook on the mark for 2016 for the price and it has not let me down.\n\nDon't let the look fool you! It comes off looking a little like a cheap plastic toy laptop, but it is well made and once you use it you will realize it is not a toy. This would be my only con. The other con is I wish it had just a little more RAM as I like tabs and probably use more than most. Sometimes I find myself with 20 plus tabs open and do see the machine slowing down when scrolling websites, but this is my issue as I am a tab junky. Less than 10 tabs and I have no issues. Also, I will say because of the RAM I have to be more selective on my Chrome Extensions, but I have this issue on my beefy computer with 16 GB of RAM sometimes and this is not a fault of the Chromebook.\n\nHope this review helps someone interested in a great Chromebook. I do not usually write reviews, just read them."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "I bought this for grad school, in lieu of using a very large and too-heavy laptop - I needed something more easily portable for running back and forth to libraries and campus.  This is my first Chromebook and I have to say I'm QUITE impressed.  I remember when they first came out people were complaining about how limiting they are, that they only work when connected to wifi, only work with certain applications, you can't do this, can't do that, etc, etc.  I have found ZERO limitations, at least in terms of anything I've tried to do with it.  The speed with which it comes up and is ready to go is astonishing - I'm so accustomed to processors and programs having to all boot up while I drink a cup of coffee waiting on it, this thing is practically always \"on\" or at least as close to \"on\" as a computer can get.  It's small and light profile makes it so easy to throw in a bag and go, I've even been able to cut back to a smaller book bag because this just takes up less space.\n\nI have to say the battery life is also one of the most remarkable aspects of this device.  I always see to it that it's fully charged before I head off to a day at the library, but even after spending LITERALLY all day at a library, working non stop on the computer and even doing data-heavy operations that should hit the battery pretty hard, I can still count on leaving the library at the end of the day with a good 3-6 HOURS of battery life still showing.  I've taken to not even bothering to pack my charger anymore - it's unnecessary.  No more worrying about finding a spot in the library or coffee shop that is close to a charger, which is remarkably freeing.\n\nI'm SOLD on Chromebooks, I think if my big huge laptop ever dies I'll just replace it with one of these.  For years I thought I HAD to have a windows laptop because of my need for word processing, excel, etc, but when I bought this I started using Google docs and have fallen in love with that completely.  I love that no matter where or on what device I sign into my Google account my documents are there, waiting on me."}

I bought this for my parents 45th anniversary present because they don't have a computer of their own.  They needed something to order groceries on and my mom likes playing free online slot games and my dad like shopping on Amazon.  It will be primarily used for internet surfing and nothing else, so I figured this laptop will do the trick.\nIt hooked up to the internet instantly which was my greatest concern.  The router is downstairs and not very close to where my parents reside upstairs, but this little chromebook zips around just as fast as my macbook when web surfing.  I introduced my mom to YouTube and the video's don't lag.  She will surely become addicted.  I love the touch pad and the keyboard, everything works great, it's sturdy.  Even if my parents get two good years out of it, I'd spend another $180 to buy a new one for another 2 years."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "For the most part, this product exceeds my expectations. The build quality feels very solid. Although its entire body is plastic (aside for the aluminum plate on the lid), there is absolutely no noticeable flex on the keyboard, and hardly any on the lid. Also, the hinge feels very solid when opening and closing it.\nThe keyboard feels good to type on and the track pad is quite decent. I'm quite happy to get an IPS panel on such an inexpensive computer. It looks quite good when looking straight on, but looses some brightness when looking at extreme angles (but this doesn't bother me).\nOne thing which was very surprising to me (aside from the solid build quality) were the speakers. They are plenty loud enough for almost any listening conditions, (and a lot better than those of other laptops I've used).\nThe wifi works very well and the battery life seems quite good (probably around 6 hrs with constant heavy use). The webcam and the microphone are quite good.\nThe only thing I can really complain about is the small amount of RAM. Having more than 5 chrome tabs open usually results in significant slow downs. However, the ability to use Chrome Remote Desktop or Team Viewer to connect to my desktop can be used to negate this RAM issue and also use Windows exclusive programs.\nOverall, I see this laptop as being very well made and having very competent components. If you plan on doing many things at once, I highly recommend opting for something with more RAM. If you plan on using this for remote controlling another computer, I see this as a good, inexpensive option."}

With decent technology at home and this Acer as a portable option, we can hopefully wait to buy him a high-powered, tricked-out MacBook when he heads to college!\n\nThis is what I would consider a \"web consumption\" kind of technology---it's great for browsing the Internet and working in the student Google-sphere, watching the occasional movie, and so on. Yes, a Chromebook is somewhere in between a tablet and a computer, but it's also not the same as what I would call a real laptop.

However, after using a Macbook Air, I guess my idea of adequate is at a higher level.  I mean I was okay with the cheap plastic casing and no back lighting on the keyboard, but It was hard to adjust to the poor screen resolution and when I played solitaire the movement was not smooth but it was jerky.  Luckily, it turns out my macbook air just needed the operating system upgraded (initially, a Mac store told me this wouldn't work, but Apple Support directed me to do this and so far so good with my Macbook Air).

I've wanted a Chromebook for a while just as a tinker laptop. As a developer, I'm always looking for new tech to experiment with and this hasn't let me down. I find myself reaching for it more than any other device now. (Including an iPad Pro which used to be my go-to for getting on the web at home.)\n\nThe size is perfect. It's not going to replace my home computer nor my development laptop. But it's the right size and weight to grab whenever I nee a computer \"right now\" to look up something, compose a quick email, etc. I even use it for presenting during our daily meetings connected to a projector. Chrome itself is superb if you're doing nothing more than using the internet. I've even found enough solutions for more fringe stuff that I want to be able to do. For example, I have a vast assortment of plain text notes stored in Dropbox that need to be accessed anywhere. I've found a fantastic Chrome OS editor (Caret) and installed the Dropbox filesystem support for Chrome OS, and now I have access to all those notes.\n\nI admit to having also opened up developer mode so I could install Ubuntu to create a web server for development as a proof of concept. I won't get much into that there, but it's something I've done.\n\nI will also admit that this isn't a fast computer. Web pages (even Google's own) are slowish to load. For most people, this will be a non-issue. For someone used to gigabit ethernet on an i7 based computer, yeah, you're going to notice it. And yet I still continue to reach for it.\n\nThe keyboard is great, and the trackpad works surprisingly well. Google must have spent some time finessing the drivers because it works better in Chrome OS than it does in Ubuntu. The keyboard is good sized and the keys are adequately responsive with acceptable travel. I really enjoy typing on it.\n\nThe display is ... well, great for this price point. But even though it's an IPS, it's not exactly Apple quality. But, again, at this price point, I'm thrilled with how good it IS. It's unlikely one is likely to complain about display quality at this price point. I do not believe you can find another IPS Chromebook in this price range.\n\nBattery life is phenomenal. I haven't measured it, but I have used it heavily and just been amazed that it keeps on going. I can use it all weekend and take it back to work to charge on Monday.\n\nRather than just ramble, I'll say that this is a great deal and a fine little computer. It's not the fastest or the most feature rich, but for the price it gets the job done quite well. Enough that this power user often finds myself going to it to handle all the small tasks throughout the day. If you're on a shoestring budget (or you like to tinker) grab one and be glad you did. If you need a computer that can run everything in the sun, then you're still going to want a Windows or Mac - that's just life. But if you (like so many) do 95% of your computing on the internet, this might be the device for you."}

I wouldn't say it has amazing performance, but it does exactly what it's meant to do, which is surf the web and do light web based tasks. The build quality is good for the price, the body feels sturdy and I am actually a fan of the texturing on the plastic body. The track pad is very smooth and the display is really good. I bought this to replace an older 15.6 Lenovo laptop I had. It is better in every aspect when comparing it to my old Lenovo, better screen, track pad, and build. The battery life on this laptop is phenomenal. It's much smaller and easier to put in my backpack compared to my 15.6 inch laptop. I'm a computer science major and I take this with me every day to school. I do my programming on it, through web based IDEs, and use it for my school work. It takes some getting used to, but after you get past the fact that your not running and .exe applications off the laptop, you'll have no problem doing normal tasks on it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "Light, Thin, Sturdy Feels /looks Like a Macbook Air. Silent fanless operation. 5 second boot up time, faster than a tablet to boot up. Battery life is the best I've experienced. 8am to 5pm continuous running with wifi on is possible, so long as you keep screen brightness to pre-set 75% level. Chrome has limitations so be aware of those if you're used to a windows experience. Skype cannot be used out of the box for example. You need to download and configure a browser extension \"ARChon\" to run the Android tablet version of Skype. It works ok. Bit laggy, and at times delayed video to audio sync. Official Google android runtime version should be better supported and is due for roll out / release soon. Most chromebook users will automatically be updated to allow google Play store apps / extensions to be used on chromebooks. Mostly this notebook feels snappy, loads content rich web pages fast enough and is ideal for general office/student/home user tasks like word processing, listening to music (the speakers are surprisingly loud and clear, much better than I expected) watching Youtube, Social media (if you're into that kind of thing) etc...

So they emailed me a pre-paid shipping label (good thing I saved the box) to send it to Texas for repair. They promised me a 5-7 business day turn around time. They made good on this promise, as I received it back in 5 days after they received it, good as new. According to the repair tag, they replaced the main board, LCD display & battery.\n\nONE YEAR AFTER PURCHASE UPDATE:\nBasically no help from ACER support off warranty, Had to repair myself:\n\nStarted experiencing the following symptoms:\n\n1. Shutdown pushbutton does not work\n\n2. Chrome browser crashed  at least once a week. Screen pixelates, then dissolves, but cursor still works and activates whatever is underneath it.\n\n3. Now  the screen was totally dead (unit was fully charged, power adaptor putting out correct voltage)\n Had to open up the back, unplugged / then plugged in battery cable,  finally came back to life.

The reasonable price, and the ability to do pretty much all I really need to do from a home computer led me to make this purchase.  It has been a good choice so far.  The battery life and good and it is so lightweight.  One small issue - I could not recharge it even with my converter plug for Ireland.  The plug is grounded so I couldn't use it with the converter set I have.  It might be nice to include a second plug for that instance.  The touchpad is not the best ever.  Sometimes I have to moisten my finger to get it to track and it has a tendency to select when I have not pushed on it.  Other than that, no complaints."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "Here are a few reasons I don't like the laptop: One, it is very so slow and laggs when you are on either Youtube or Facebook or just both at the same time. I caution you if you had facebook up, you would experience it frozen on you a bunch of times.\n\nAlso, there are NO cap locks so you had to shift down every time to type. Another thing there is no save option when you are on google docs. It is supposedly save for you but I like the assurance I do it myself!\n\nAnother thing is if you want to print off your computer. HAHA! Not going to happen. It only accepts printers with wireless printers. So if you got an old reliable printer where you use your usb to connect to your computer, it will not work for you! You have to obtain an app that links to a printer that is accessible to use.\n\nI still have it but it is a pain in the butt having to have a computer that froze or crash on you like two times every other day. For a GOOGLE CHROME computer it SUCKS!\n\nYeah I said it a big internet company supposedly famous and reliable needs to step back on computers. I also want to let EVERYONE know DON'T PURCHASE THE LAPTOP!\n\nI want everyone to dodge the pain in the butt moments with that computer and also I want everyone to save your money!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "Bought this laptop as something I could take to class for notes, etc.  My previous HP laptop is fantastic but the battery lasts two hours on the dimmest screen setting.  I didn't want to drop $1200 on a CAD-capable laptop, so I have this Chromebook and a separate desktop at home that's capable.\n\nThe idea was, this Chromebook is capable of everything I need to do while at school and when I get home, I can do the real number-crunching.  I just got it yesterday, and I used it for six hours typing my lab report.  I've used it an hour today and the battery is at 43%; that's ridiculous!  I didn't even have the screen dim, it's about in the middle.  I watched some YouTube for an hour or so, played music, etc.  Works great.\n\nKeyboard feels great, yes the touchpad click requires a BIG push to click it, but tapping on it also works to click (tapping like you would on a smartphone).  Chrome OS updated itself when I got it which took a bit of a hit on my internet speed, but no matter, it's decent.  When I plugged it in to my 1080p monitor, keyboard and mouse (\"docking\" it) it worked fine, but it isn't as smooth, if you will, as my windows PC.  But for $150, this is a fantastic deal and it will definitely get the job done, well.  If you haven't already, go for it!\n\n-- EDIT after 2 years of use --\nBattery life has not degraded noticeably and I still can't remember the last time I charged it, haha!  Definitely nearly a week of using it in class for notes in a charge.  Also, the charger is pretty quick; 45 minutes on the charger went from 25% to 75%.\n\nI did have a small issue with the chassis.  I didn't drop the laptop, but I do put it in the 'laptop' compartment of my backpack which places it right against your back.  I then rode my bike to school and the chassis seemed twisted (on the table, it would rock like a wobbly chair).  To fix this, I just used my hands and bent it back and it fixed it.  That tells me the chassis isn't metal but plastic -- just something to keep in mind.\n\nI further reiterate that this laptop is certainly no rocketship.  It gets the job done, but google drive (ironically) is one of the laggiest websites along with facebook.  It's a shame, because google drive is where I take notes for class, so I often need to rush into class, open it, navigate into the correct class folder, create a new document, and title it as fast as possible and typically it isn't ... that fast.  Anyhow, FWIW this laptop is fine for what it's designed to do."}

I am now free from Windows updates, I'm done with Virus protection software, I am free to USE my computer, instead of it calling the shots!  I feel liberated and enabled!  Google has the right idea (Chromebook), and Acer has the right product (the CB3-131). It is simple, fast, and inexpensive.  It simply works.  It boots faster than my tablet (cold start) and the battery lasts longer.  A touchscreen is nice on a tablet, but completely unnecessary on this computer; the touch pad is the best I've ever used.  I LOVE this computer."}

It's really lightweight too and easily transportable. It doesn't get hot. The battery lasts forever. I LOVE IT. Plus it was very affordable. I am really starting to like the google chrome operating system as I can access my stuff from anywhere and even save pics from my phone to google drive and boom I got on my drive on my chromebook and there they are.

The rounded edges (no wrist-cutting sharp edges like on too many trendy devices these days), good keyboard, glare-free screen, instant-on, battery life, and most of all, the simplicity make it a real joy to use.\n\nI was surprised that the mouse pointer disappears when not needed, just like on the Mac.  Mac-like Expose was also nice to discover.  It's more refined than Google would lead you to believe looking at their Chromebook website.  Well done, Google--you should let people know about these little bits of awesomeness.\n\nI was also super impressed that my Meridian Explorer DAC just works--paired with Sony Pro headphones this thing rocks.  Even without headphones it impresses; the speakers are astonishingly loud and not tinny.  SD cards sit flush with the left edge, which means I can load up a card with music and files and just leave it in the machine and forget it's there.  It would be nice if screen resolution was Full HD, but I zoom most things anyway, so that's not that big of a deal.\n\nAll-around it's a great device.  I bought one for everyone in the family, even though we all already have Apple devices of all shapes and sizes--and everyone loves the Chromebook.  I struggle to find a more long-term enjoyable use of $180."}

It provides a 'full' sound.\n-The charge lasts for roughly 9-10 hours with typical use (Facebook, online shopping, etc), and about 5-6 hours with Netflix\n-Very quick when jumping from page to page or loading things\n-Very light overall\n\nCons:\n-Only comes with two usb ports (which stinks if I want to use a usb mouse, then I'm down to one)\n-Google Play store doesn't have enough 'favorite games' that I play with my Android phone\n-Loud touchpad mouse. This seems like an odd thing to say, but when I 'click' the mouse, it makes a very loud sound and quickly becomes obnoxious\n-The top of the lid is rough, which makes decals hard to stick (and stay on)\n\nThis Chromebook is perfect for the work I need to do, and also it great for the online shopping, buying music, or just playing around.

I told her I would use it for a couple days to see if it is something that I can also buy for her 9yr old sister. I have an older Acer that I love, but this little thing is amazing! I want to keep this for myself! The packaging was great and upon opening it, the battery was dead but I was able to plug in the computer and use it immediately. It went through a typical set up but was super easy and quick to set up! I have had it now for two days and last night I used to play music to sleep to for NINE hours on just the battery and when I woke up, it was still going! It is zippy and the feel of it is super light and feels sturdy. it feels like it has some sort of powder coating on the shell. The only weird thing I am finding about it is the keyboard is a little different than the one on my bigger Acer, but that is to be expected and can easily get used to it. What is already loaded on the computer with icons at the bottom is the Google Chrome search engine, Gmail, Google docs and youtube. So, even if you need a word processor, Google docs can do about anything and you can just download what you need from there. If you are a parent on the fence about getting your kid a computer that is simple with not alot of bloatware, this is seriously the one for you! I wish I would have just bought this for them instead of a Kindle last Christmas! This has so many more features! There are two USB ports, one on each side, a headphone jack so if you are going for a long trip, not only will the battery last a long time for you, but each kid can have their own thing going on. There is also an HDMI port as well as SD. Oh! and the speakers are GREAT! You would think out of a little thing like this, that the speakers would not be very good.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "This Chromebook is lightweight and holds a charge all day. I'm a public-school teacher on a budget, and since my district uses the Google suite for education, this fit the bill perfectly. I've used it daily for almost a year, and it serves all my needs, from streaming online videos, to creating documents through Google, to grading, even, using multiple online programs. If you can subsist on using the browser alone for all your tech needs, this night be the only little computer you need. When my kids get old enough to require their own laptops, I would not mind investing in these, because they are so cost effective and handy."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "This is my first chromebook and also my first laptop. I own a decade old Dell computer and while it suits me for the most part I was looking for a cheap alternative to a portable computer, and this fits the bill perfectly! So small and light enough for me to carry around practically anywhere without taking up much space. It has a nice, bright screen and a long battery life. I was a bit concerned at first because people were saying 2 GB of ram is not very useful because it is too slow, but so far I haven't noticed any problems as far as speed is concerned. I have been playing a game called Arcane Legends and have had no lag at all.\n\nThe keyboard took a little getting use to, as did the OS. Chromebooks are not for everyone as they can't do everything a regular laptop can. I don't really like the fact that it's mostly an online device, but you can run and edit documents offline and if necessary you can download documents and save them to the chromebook itself or to an SD card. I did find the USB ports to be a bit funky though--it took a minute or two to get the devices to fit in and the same for taking them out. After a few tries, however, they go in and out well enough. The only other gripe I can think of at the moment is clicking on the bottom of the mousepad involves pressing down rather firmly and the noise is a bit loud for my taste. I usually just use the touch gesture for quiet clicking.\n\nAll in all this is a very handy little laptop and I can see why it would be considered useful for schoolwork and things. My sister received a new laptop as a gift and it's amusing how often she has to charge her laptop while I can use mine practically all day without plugging it in. So yes, I am very satisfied with this purchase and will update this review in the future to see how well it holds up."}

I don't know if I have a faulty battery, but I'm also not getting close to the amount of work time out of it as I did with the older model when it was new. And the four pads on the underside of the laptop that are meant to grip the surface below are quite plasticy, allowing it to slide around a lot. A minor issue, I know, but incredibly annoying.\n\nI've owned multiple Acer products and have been pleased with all of them, so I'm surprised to be so disappointed by this Chromebook.

No start-up or shut-down time, which I also love; it is similar to using an iPad or tablet in this sense.  I required a full keyboard for writing and editing documents, and the keyboard feels comfortable. The keys are slightly smaller than on standard keyboards, but it is so slight that I've had no trouble adapting as a typist.\n\nThis is my first time using Chrome OS, coming from a long time using Windows OS.  What I enjoyed the most was the first start-up.  The instructions are as simple as: Plug-in, turn on.  Logging in was simple (with my gmail account), and all bookmarks were transferred because I've been using Chrome browser for years.  There was no ad-ware I needed to uninstall.  The navigation is simple and easy to use - and I will comment the wallpaper selection it comes with is full of very beautiful photographs from around the world.\n\nThe battery life is as advertised; a full charge lasts me 7 - 9 hours depending on if I brighten or darken the screen.

I would have laughed a few years ago at the idea of a chromebook which is a fraction of the cost of a good computer. Yet, if you are tech savy, there are workarounds and apps that you can use that can make his work - so not to the extent of a thousand dollar computer - but this is more like comparing a Jeep to a Lexus, it could get you where you want to go - maybe not as fast, and it can take you to some new really cool places. Switching to a Google environment is not a big sacrifice. As for internal memory, remember you have a 3.0 USB, a 2.0 USB, a SD card slot and a regular size HDMI port. Plus, since most Apps are actually secure shortcuts to Google or other websites, much of what you do will be stored in the cloud anyway. There are sites that allow you to do music track mutitracking, photo editing, even computer coding.\n\nNo, you can't have 20 tabs open or throw heavy tasks at this and expect it to perform like a costly machine. You also can't do heavy graphic intensive gaming, but you would struggle with these tasks anyway on computers costing twice the amount of this thing.\n\nPair it with a keyboard that has a finger touchpad (instead of a mouse) and look for apps that do what you are used to doing on a regular computer. Also add a good USB thumbdrive, external drive, or SD card and you will be wondering why most people aren't buying a chromebook like this one.\n\nMany people don't get these because they assume that they need so much more, like I did. Yet, it works for me with very few real sacrifices and some gains.\n\nAlso, I want to add that the screen size is big enough, and you can always (ALT) + (+) to zoom in or HDMI it to a Large HD TV or monitor."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "In a nutshell: For the right person this could be a game changer. If you are aware of the limitations (and strengths) of Chrome OS and are thinking about taking the leap to a Chromebook, this well-built and surprisingly speedy laptop has a charm that could appeal to you.\n\nI consider myself a pc power user: I have a dedicated custom-built desktop for my hardcore gaming and heavy software suites, as well as a fairly beefy laptop for lighter gaming and everything else in between. And yet, I felt like I was missing something. Although my laptop is portable, it's still a lot larger than I would like to carry. And despite its great specs, I still found the long Windows boot times to inhibit spontaneous use. I wanted something ultra light and portable that I could tuck away in a large purse or small bag to take to a cafe to do some light browsing, gaming, writing, etc and not worry about damaging hard drives or losing personal files if stolen.\n\nI've never really considered getting an Acer laptop--I never considered it to be a quality brand so I always steered away. But after trying out a bunch of different Chromebooks in multiple different stores, I found the built quality and responsiveness of this model to be head and shoulders above the rest (even more expensive ones). We'll see how this thing holds up over time, but after having it for a few days I can say it feels reliable and sturdy, no rattles etc.\n\nBuild quality and feel: This thing brings a smile to my face. For someone who was for so long bogged down by high-spec but unwieldy computers, this thing is charming, fun, and a delight to use. I prefer using this over my expensive computers! It feels rugged yet slim, with a quality-feeling plastic/aluminum case and more tapered square edges (which appeals to me over sharp aluminum edges). I just love the feel of this thing. And it seems rugged enough to take a little abuse (though I wouldn't want to try dropping it to see how it fares). I'd say it's a good option for kids or those who need something that can be tucked into a bag without fear. The screen hinges feel sturdy, too. I love how there are no fans to make noise. It doesn't get hot.\n\nSound: Speakers are located in on the front right and left sides as small indented slats. Sound is surprisingly good! I wasn't expecting to use this to play music much so but this is a pleasant surprise. Plus, it comes with a headphone jack that appears to also be a combined headphone/mic jack. I do find however that if placed on a pillow, the pillow may dampen some of the sound since the speakers are pretty near the bottom of the case. But I don't mind too much--you just need to adjust it slightly.\n\nKeyboard and trackpad: THIS IS THE BEST TRACKPAD I'VE EVER USED. This is actually one of the main reasons I selected this one over the others. It's very smooth, accurate, and responsive. My trackpad on my HP laptop drives me absolutely crazy as it jumps around a lot and the click rocker often mistakes a left click for a right click. This one is so much better to use, and the surface is way smoother so my (clean) fingers don't drag...instead they gloss right over and the computer responds quickly and accurately. It is also equipped with finger gesture recognition so you can scroll up/down with two fingers, switch between tabs with a swipe of three fingers, etc. Makes everything I do a much better experience. I like the solid feel of the keyboard--perfect fit for me, though it's a bit narrow (but that's the nature of getting an ultra portable laptop). The keyboard tray doesn't give when pressed, so it feels solid on that end. No backlight on the keys which makes it harder to type at night, but I find the keys feel more solid/sturdy which is appealing to me.\n\nScreen: I love the matte finish--no glare. Surprisingly good viewing angles. I find it sufficient and easy on my eyes (though people with failing vision may find it too small). It's not super high resolution but I find it completely fine for me, even when watching detailed, sci-fi movies. It definitely surpassed by expectations for this budget computer. Brightness can be cranked up high enough for anything I'd ever need. I appreciate the low impact on battery life.\n\nSpeed: The Chrome OS works very well on low-spec computers, and here it shines. This thing is fast enough for most of my needs. I appreciate how the Intel Celeron processor is low on battery consumption. Though don't expect to be able to run more than 10 tabs or so. I did experience a crash when I was streaming music and had other tabs open and was downloading music to the sd card I installed. But with only 2gb of RAM, I wasn't too surprised. It booted right back up. More RAM is always better, but at this price point it's fine.\n\nPortability: I love that I can stop what I'm doing, close the lid, toss it in a bag and forget about it and not worry about spinning hard drives, battery consumption, etc. I open the lid and everything is back up in a jiffy. No waiting for Windows to load up again.\n\nOverall appeal: Cheery, ultra-portable, ridiculously easy and pleasurable to use, long battery life, quick, and solid. I love it!! Would buy again and recommend to family."}

So far it has not done it with any other website but I run a FB page which requires a lot of scrolling and it freezing is very annoying.\nI don't usually like holding the power button down to turn off a computer, but that is the only way I can get it unfrozen. I waited 1 hour to see if it would unfreeze and force close chrome. No response.\nI have not tested it on other websites to see if endless scrolling freezes it up, but just a warning that it could happen on more than just FB."}

I have to say though this has been on of the best purchases I have made. It is small, light, compact, and fast. They keyboard and screen are great. After having this chromebook for over a month now I feel safe saying I doubt the problems they had were caused by the manufacturer and not from dropping them or other mishaps they had on their own. I had friends trying to talk me out of the purchase after reading some of the reviews. From the first week they were completely envious. One of them have already bought one for their daughter in high school and a couple others are waiting for their birthdays. The price is great. I highly recommend the neoprene case it suggests and a wireless mouse. I can't say enough good things about this purchase!!"}

Some pages take particularly longer to load.  I wouldnt recommend having more than 5-6 tabs open, things start slowing down.\nChrome os is a limited, you can use Microsoft excel, but keep in mind the hotkeys don't work.\nSmall learning curve for people are first using Chrome OS, no caps lock, and no delete key, takes a while to get used to.\n\nOverall I think this is a really good chromebook.  I love the IPS display.  I believe this is the best value chromebook.  I highly recommend installing ublock (to block ads), h64ify ( condesenses youtube videos.)"}

The school I go to were contemplating getting these, macs, or ipads for students and they went for the worst one (the chromebook). In fact im typing on this POS right now. It can be super slow, the touch screen isn't very sensitive, the keyboard sucks because there is no caps lock, you have to double click the apostrophe for it to register, and when im typing in a google doc it will randomly jump to the middle of what has already been typed and continue to type. Its garbage. I wish the school would have got macs. When I was in fourth grade we got to use macs for a little bit and they were super old but they were still better than this garbage. Please take my advice as young student with experience with this computer, DONT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!!!!\n\np.s. they break super easily"}

Super quick boot time, actually 3-4 secs.\n2. Extremely handy to use the keypad, I've seen many people talking about plugging an external mouse which I don't think is necessary. Just in case you don't know. Tap using 2 fingers simultaneously for 'right click', drag up or down using 2 fingers to scroll. Drag sideways left or right to switch between tabs using 2 fingers.\n3. Browser and other apps are pretty quick and responsive. Tons in the Web store for download.\n4. Word, Excel and PowerPoint are simple and you wouldn't feel alienated at all if you are a regular MS office user. You can literally speak to word app, which recognizes and translates into script seamlessly.\n5. Battery - I've used YouTube with the built in speakers and it lasted for a wholly 8 hour straight. Trust me!\n\nDemerits:\n1. I bought a white one and the color is bright white unlike the silverish white and prone to become untidy soon.\n2.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "I was very impressed by the screen. You will be hard-pressed to find a better screen on any Chromebook under $200. The viewing angles aren't as good as IPS screens on more expensive notebooks but it's far superior to the crap TN panels on most Chromebooks. The screen is matte so I have no problems with any reflections. I didn't notice any back light bleed on the display.\n\nBattery life is VERY good. I managed to get around 7 to 8 hours with my use. Charges very quickly from 0 to 100% in under 90 minutes.\n\nThe N2840 processor loaded most pages quickly but had a hard time fluidly playing MP4 or MKV videos off of my USB flash drives. The faster Broadwell processor on my Dell Chromebook 13 had no problems with the same task.\n\nI love the keyboard! I found it to be a pleasure to type on with great feedback from the keys.\n\nThe bottom line is that this is an amazing Chromebook for under $200. I would never recommend anything to you that I wouldn't use for myself and the screen alone is reason enough to strongly consider this for your first / next Chromebook."}

A chrome book should 1) Surf the web quickly, 2) Provide quality visual experience, and 3) Provide reasonable sound quality. And this machine does all this very well.

Trying to find apps on here that actually fit your needs is almost impossible and extremely aggravating, my keyboard tries to correct all my letters to have accents an I have to press the key multiple times for it to revert back to English. If you're big in to photos, editing them on a Chromebook is next to impossible because finding a good, compatible program is a needle in a haystack. My shockwave flash never stops crashing. I purchased an external DVD player to plug in to the USB slot so I could watch DVDs just to find out CHROMEBOOKS DO NOT SUPPORT EXTERNAL DVD PLAYERS!!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "Let me start off saying that I am a long time Mac user. I've only ever known my Mac, and I loved it dearly. It was more than I ever needed in a laptop, but it was time for a change (it was dying and falling apart on me). I've played around on a friends dell/windows (?) laptop before, and hated it ( not the desktop though). I just couldn't get used to the \"feel\" of it and the mouse touch pad drove me crazy. It seemed more complicated than my Macs mouse touch pad. So with my lack in laptop experience, I was a hesitant shopper.\nI researched what I could and this Acer Chromebook seemed to have good reviews and was in my price range! (I even posted some questions and got some very helpful answers from users here on amazon!)\n\nI bought the\n~Intel Celeron N2840 2.16 GHz\n~2 GB DDR3L SDRAM\n~16 GB Internal Storage\n~11.6-Inch HD IPS Screen, Intel HD Graphics\n~Patterned Aluminum Cover, Google Chrome, Up to 9-hour battery life\nChromebook (New)\n\nI've only been using this Chromebook for a few day's now (I'm actually writing this review on it right now), and I have to say I absolutely love it!\nI was worried about a memory so I picked up a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SanDisk-32GB-Class-4-SDHC-Memory-Card-Frustration-Free-Packaging-SDSDB-032G-AFFP-Label-May-Change/dp/B007JRB0RE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SanDisk 32GB Class 4 SDHC Memory Card, Frustration-Free Packaging- SDSDB-032G-AFFP (Label May Change)</a>. I've been leaving it in my Chromebook without any problem. It almost perfectly lines up with the side of the chromebook. So as long as I'm not pushing in the sides, the SD card shouldn't accidentally be \"clicked\" out. I haven't used any memory yet other than saving a couple pictures (to set my wallpaper and my sign in picture).\n\nThis Chromebook is lightweight and I can easily move it from room to room. There is no overheating/fan noise (and I've played around on it for HOURS and the underneath barely gets warm!). Offline I feel like, the battery would last up to 9 hours, but i've been playing online (not paying attention to how long) and I still don't worry about charging it until its there is about 10-15% life left, which is after hours of use! (and it only seems to take about 1 1/2 -2 hours to charge to full when I'm not on it). I make sure to take it off the charger after it is fully charged (I hear keeping any electronics on the charger after it is fully charged could decrease the battery usage/life and i'd rather be safe than sorry!)\nI love the keyboard, It's feels just like any regular keyboard. Minus the \"cap lock\" button. Which is the only button i'm getting used to not having (since I used to use it all the time) But love the search button, and how you can talk search too! (I'm still learning all the fun little things that come along with owning this little laptop!)\nThe mouse touch pad has a nice feel and use to it. I like just \"tapping\" the Mouse pad allows you to \"click\" and that if you put pressure on the mouse pad, you can actually click (for highlighting, copy and pasting etc) I actually found that out by accident! (I was sad at first because I thought  there was no way to highlight text or \"right click\" things - click with two fingers on the mouse pad!)\n\nNow to have full use of this Chromebook you DO need to have a Google account. You can either create one upon starting up the Chromebook or log into an existing account. There is not much to the start up paper, but it easy to figure things out just by playing around with the Chromebook!\nI think I covered about all I can think of!\n\nAs of right now, I absolutely love this Chromebook and I do not regret ordering it! I've been able to surf the web, watch Youtube, play games (on websites Like facebook and gaiaonline), work on point to cash sites, and start up google documents without any problems! (all with good speeds too!) I've even messed around with the camera a bit!\n\nIf anyone is looking for a case/pouch to go with your 11.6in chromebook, I bought one that suits my needs (and I can fit the charger in the other zipper too!) :\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Evecase-Acer-Chromebook-11-6-Inch-CB3-111-C670-Neoprene-Sleeve-Pouch-Case-with-Handle-For-Acer-Chromebook-11-C670-C720-C710-Laptop-PC-Green/dp/B00HJ0W6U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Evecase Acer Chromebook 11.6-Inch CB3-111-C670 Neoprene Sleeve Pouch Case with Handle For Acer Chromebook 11 C670 / C720 / C710 Laptop PC - Green</a>"}

It's perfect for me - I am no longer in school and spend most of my computer time on the internet. I use Office Online for word processing and have had no issues with that. Google Drive is intuitively easy and makes organizing your files a snap. I can't honestly say there are any features not available on this unit that I miss - there are apps for nearly everything that I had been using on my MacBook and those that I haven't found replacements for I really don't find myself needing anyway. The unit itself is great for the price. The keyboard is not backlit, which my MacBook hadn't been either so that doesn't bother me. The unit is compact and light which means it's easy to take along with me if I need it. The battery lasts easily 8 hours and charges quickly. Boot up is extremely quick. The only issue I've had is occasionally losing my internet connection but that was a preexisting issue that comes from my router. All told, I really love this Chromebook. It's quick, portable, and does everything I need it to do. Highly recommended for those who need a computer for the basics."}

When i press the on button it immediately goes to my log in screen, it doesn't even take two seconds to start up. The only thing it hasn't been so swell with is when my husband was using it for work and would have 10+ tabs open at a time and at that point it would start to lag a bit. For me that no problem i have 6 tabs open at most. Overall this is a great buy!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "This is my first chromebook so I don't have another model to compare it to. Overall I like it. It starts up fast, & resumes where you left off, & the battery life seems good. The ONLY issue is that most apps are slow to load & app downloads/installs fail often the first time & have to be restarted, but they usually succeed on the second try. That is important since it is basically a web browser. I knew what I was getting when I got it, so I'm not going to be too critical. I think it's worth getting still. By the way any acer cb3-131-???? chromebook is the SAME model. Different stores give it a different product number so they can say that it's a different model & refuse to price match."}

I've had a hp\nChromebook 14 before but I absolute love this one. The speakers are fabulous and it's light weight, it has a perfect screening, and the keyboard is full size (my hp one didn't feel as nice)\nThe one thing I didn't like was the way my mouse pad felt but it feels fine now I'm used to it could be I'm not used to it.\nNice Intel processor I can use word online my ho chromebook absolute wouldn't let me open it and this one I can even get the app. I paid 250 for my chromebook 14 and only 180 about for this one and worth every penny. Despite bad reviews get this. I'll update in a couple weeks but as of now it's perfect and no big flaws. I'm a freak about my computers so I ordered a cute case and I'm waiting on a keyboard one. Get this."}

We realize more every day how much we didn't need a full size laptop.  This compact dynamite does it all!  It is fast and the charge lasts us all day.  When we do charge it, it charges very quickly and then goes and goes and goes.  The picture is clear and the sound is better than we had on our HP laptops.  Totally satisfied with these and probably will never get a laptop again.  With this replacement, who needs one?! Oh, plus the cost of 2 of these was still more than a hundred dollars less than  just one of our laptops 3 years ago. Right now we are printing off one of the laptops until our printer dies.  My husband rigged it so the chromebook and laptop are setup with the printer.  No big deal.  When the printer dies, it will be replaced with a cloud printer and that will simplify our lives even more.  Love this lightweight beauty!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "My laptop was getting slower and hotter over time and decided to give this a try as I was increasingly using cloud-based computing.  First impressions: WOW!  Light, crisp, and very intuitive, as a Chrome user for a long time.  If you're heavy into word processing, powerpoints or need off-line capabilities, might have a transition period, but for browsing and cloud-based computing - it is awesome!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "I got this on a whim from a local  retailer.  For the price its awesome for browsing and watching vids on the web.  For $170. its fast compared to more expensive tablets/laptops, rends pages better, plays vids good  Only downside is I wish I got one with a larger screen.  The battery life is also awesome!"}

However having used it every day since I bought it a couple of weeks I love it.\n\nI use it mostly on the web and it is fast and easy to use.\n\nThe size and weight are perfect for a mobile user. The screen is a good size. Big enough to read without being cumbersome.\n\nAcer has produced a wonderful machine at a great price."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "Was rated one of the highest computers for teaching online and traveling . I wanted to like it so much however open the box and there is no cursor. Once I do tons of searching and trouble shooting I can enable cusor but not able to click. Resets and everything nothing allows me to click. This seems to be a hardware issue leaving abroad in a week for over a year this is my only computer to teach so cant refund. Looks like Ill have to get Bluetooth mouse. Which defeats purpose of portable computer. I wanted to love this computer but many users also said faulty trackpad on the Acer chromebook. Hoping wireless mouse I can fix settings, because Im stuck with it now."}

It was opened in May 2018 and two weeks later the screen turned blue, green, then black and the thing shut down to never come back on again. I submitted for service repair under Amazon service request to get no response. I reached out again today to see if I will get a response. I also reached out directly to the manufacturer since it is under the 1 yr warranty still. I pray it can be repaired."}

IT. IS. NOT. You cannot save documents to your desktop. The version of Office that is MILDLY compatible to chromebook is horrible. The best use for chromebook is to go onto amazon and order a new laptop from it."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B019G7VPTC", "review": "It worked great for 3 months then I went to turn it on and it wouldn't. I let it sit for a weekend plugged in and it suddenly turned on again. Worked well for a week, then the same issue. If I ever try to turn it on from powered all the way off, it refuses to turn on again for several days. It's confusing and frustrating and unreliable. I can't use it, and I'm just out the money now. Half the time plugging it in will not light up the battery light (I've used multiple cords, so it's not the charging cable) and the other half the lights do show. There's nothing I can tell for why it does this. A defective product with no help from Amazon to fix or replace."}
