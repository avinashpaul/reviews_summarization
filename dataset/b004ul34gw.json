{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I`m trying really, really hard to like the playbook, but it`s becoming increasingly difficult to continue doing so. The reason I bought the playbook was because of its browser. But it doesn`t work any of the interactive flash video sites I visited. I was also under the impression that android apps would work on the playbook. But the app situation is really, really bad. Blackberry should get sued for false advertising. The only apps available are a bunch of worthless ones in the bb app store. They don`t even have a google books app. The battery takes FOREVER to charge. I plugged my playbook in this morning at 9am, and it`s only at 85% now (3:37pm). The email problem is also a pain. I can`t believe they don`t have a unified email or any email, for that matter. The playbook`s wifi sucks too. On school and work networks, you have to set it up manually or have physical access to the router.\n\nI waited a long time for the playbook to come out. All the hype about the ipad annoyed the crap out of me, and I was excited to finally get a tablet that could do what any computer from five years ago could do. But I`m having trouble liking it now that I have it, so I can`t see myself keeping it. I will be returning my playbook tomorrow morning. Thanks for the big letdown.\n\nI had to go to three different retailers before I could finally buy the playbook. The first two didn`t even know that yesterday was the release date. At the third place, they didn`t even have a display unit out. None of the three places had accessories; in fact, at the third place, the sales rep kept trying to push me into buying kindle screen protectors. I`m in Philadelphia. We`re a big market. Do you even want to make money?"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I agree with all of the good things the other reviewers have posted. I'd like to add the following:\n\nPros\n1. You can access your Playbook wirelessly over your wi-fi network. (I'm loading music onto mine this way while I type.)\n2. You can also access it via USB, which is faster than wireless, but does require it to be physically connected to the computer.\n3. The web browser is awesome! It has full java and flash support. Face book, You tube, even Drop box work as they do on a laptop\n4. Professional Documents To Go (Word, Excel and PowerPoint) come pre installed, and they work very well.\n5. Video playback is great, it will play mp4 and Xvid/divx based avi.\n6. If you load your pictures in folders, the folders appear as `albums' on the tablet, very handy for organizing\n7. It has resources enough to allow true multitasking and switching between applications is great.\n8. The music player is great, and it supports random play\n9. Audio, video and display quality is excellent.\n10. The virtual keyboard is excellent. If you don't get along well with touch screens a capacitive stylus works well\nCons\n1. It won't play wmv, won't decode Dolby AC3.\n2. It does not support Bluetooth A2DP.\n3. It does not have a file manager on the tablet; you have to do this via your PC. You can delete files on the tablet but that's about it.\n4. It does not yet have an e-book reader. You can convert e-books to PDF and read them but the PDF reader is pretty bare bones.\n\nTo date RIM has pushed one OS update, which installed flawlessly via wi-fi. I hope there will be additional ones to resolve the above issues. In the meanwhile I'm VERY pleased with my tablet, 7\" is the perfect screen size and it does everything I expected it to do."}

I for one will wait for the price to go down. I don't think that the value for the money at this time is worth it. As for the other writer saying that it already has updates coming in, well this is to be expected.\n\nThe top of the line should not be anywhere near the $700.00 mark.\n\nThis is not competitive pricing. I use the blackberry 9000 and i have 2 of them. I use this as i find the other keyboards hard to use as i have short fingers. I have used the torch and find that this is also out of the market for me and the use of the playbook would allow me (i think) to get a newer bb and move ahead.\n\nSo for now I will not be buying the playbook (or a newer blackberry) till this is sorted out.\n\nSince MAC has already started lawsuits for the type of \"PAD\", i am curious to know if RIM will be effected by this and therefore stop making the playbook and support for same.\n\nRegards"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "If you're like me - then you've probably been waiting for a while for RIM to enter the tablet market with their long-overdue BlackBerry Playbook.  RIM's been touting a couple of features that were a first for any tablet at the time - namely two cameras, one front and one back, HD output and a mini-HDMI port, along with finally releasing the new QNX OS (which RIM badly needed).\n\nWell, unfortunately for RIM, they once again took their time getting this to consumers, and the end result is once again a whole bunch of those new features aren't really new anymore.  IPad 2 introduced the two camera system for Apple, and I believe the new Galaxy 2 tablet coming out in a few months will have it as well.  A bunch of tablets are also now HD-capable, and a bunch also have HDMI ports.\n\nAnywho - I picked this device up today from Best Buy, and to sum it up in a sentence: classy, but expensive.\n\nFor a more detailed review, here goes ---\n\nPROS:\n1) The OS.  By George, RIM finally has a decent OS!!  If anyone has ever had or messed around with a Blackberry phone, one of the biggest gripes you'll have is that the OS is just... well, crappy.  OS 5 and 6 were big improvements - but they still each leave alot out (like the browser - god, does Blackberry's browser suck at times), especially when you check out an IPhone or Android phone.  The QNX is RIM's newest OS, and I hope they move their phones over to it ASAP.  Clean, snappy, and doesn't actually use all that much memory - if you delve into the settings of the device.  I will add, though - that as soon as I turned on my device, it had to update the OS.  Nice RIM - already pushing out updates....  Doesn't bode well, but we'll see.\n\n2) Screen.  I'll give RIM credit, they did awesome here.  The screen on the Playbook is nothing short of stellar.  I played the movie Megamind (great movie) in HD on it, and it looked fantastic.  Even better, hooked it up via HDMI to a projector, and it looked fantastic on the wall too.  7\" may be a little small to people - IPad's is almost 10\", and so is Galaxy 2 (supposedly - we'll see) - but I like the 7\" screen personally.  I don't really need a bigger screen - that's what I have a laptop for.\n\n3) Weight.  This also might be a touchy subject - but again, I personally like a device that feels solid in my hands.  The Playbook definitely fits this bill.  Although it only technically weighs 1 pound, it feels much heavier.  The construction seems excellent - putting pressure on various points, the device barely bends.\n\n4) Blackberry Bridge.  Hell yeah RIM - I do NOT want to pay extra for another 3G data plan.  Instead, what RIM does is by tethering your Blackberry phone to the Playbook, you can use the data plan on your phone to get the internet on your Playbook - and it works right out the box!!  You don't even need a cable - it also works via BlueTooth!!  Only problem - just works with Blackberry phones.  If RIM updated this to work with all phones, that would make it literally perfect.\n\nCONS:\n1) Price.  Jeez, 499 for the base model - 16 GB.  64 GB rings in at 699.  (These prices come from Best Buy).  It's a nice device, don't get me wrong, but 500 bucks for the base model??  There's a bunch of cheaper options out there.  Especially with the size of the device - it's a little hard to justify.  I hope RIM fixes this problem soon, for their sake.\n\n2) Apps.  Always seems to come back to this as well for RIM.  The apps for the device - at the time of this - equal less than 100.  Yeah, that's right.  With the new OS, that means that all apps have to be rewritten to be able to work with the device - and be able to handle the bigger screen.  I believe the IPad has over 25,000 apps specifically made for it, and the Galaxy and XOOM both use Android - and have its market to work with.  Clearly RIM has an uphill battle here.  Hopefully RIM supporting Flash on the Playbook will help the apps roll in, but I wouldn't hold my breath...\n\n3) No e-mail support.  As of right now - the Playbook does not work with BES servers.  That means no enterprise e-mail support, or ability to control the device via IT policies.  You must be joking RIM.  Seamless e-mail support is the main reason people get Blackberries, and you can't make the Playbook to support this??  Fail....\n\nThere's a couple other things too I can think of - for both categories - but these delve deeper into the enterprise features of the devices, so if you're interested, leave me a comment and I'll reply\n--------------------------\n\nThe Blackberry Playbook is definitely a good entry for RIM - worthy of giving some of the other tablets a run for their money.  RIM has of late been really lagging behind when it comes to keeping up with the tech of the day, but with the Playbook, they've finally stepped up to the plate.  As for hitting a home run - ehhh, I've give them a double.  The Playbook shines in a number of areas - but the key feature to me is the Blackberry Bridge.  This is something that I hope a bunch of other tablets start incorporating - being able to use your phone's data plan on your tablet, without having to pay an extra 50 bucks for a separate one.\n\nRIM, fix the weak spots on your device (either by updates or in the 2nd generation), and you could have a real winner here.\n\nAs far as recommendations go - for the average user, if you're feeling adventurous, go ahead and get a Playbook.  It's a great device at what it does, but expanding those functions are difficult, especially with so few apps.  For everyone else - stick with the IPad, XOOM, or Galaxy - at least until the apps get rolling on this device.\n\n-- I'll update this periodically as more information and my usage time with it increases - so check back every so often --\n\nUPDATE:  Someone asked me in a comment if the Playbook had a memory card slot - which I forgot to include in my review.  Unfortunately, the Playbook does NOT have an SD card slot - although, by using the Blackberry Bridge software, you can get the SD card that's on your phone to work with the Playbook.  But as far as plugging in a card to the device itself - no.  Thanks to J. Scheider for asking.\n\nUPDATE (5/4/2011):  RIM has announced that they'll be releasing the Video Chat app - a video conferencing app that will take advantage of the front and rear cameras, very much like Apple's FaceTime.  It's supposed to be part of an OS upgrade that will get released sometime this week - I'll let you know how it is once I've tested it out."}

I was getting this tablet for work - Spreadsheets, Word Docs and hopefully use the Bible app. The price was manageable and I figured that even if it turns out to be obsolete, I can still use it as a music player in our kitchen or something. Well, I was pleasantly surprised by this little tablet. The OS is brilliant. It's such a joy and ease for multi-tasking. I was able to get my spreadsheets on it immediately and use it to check my messages and keep my calendar. The Bible app works flawlessly. Yes, the tablet is a little slow, but it's a 2011 tablet, it's to be expected. Yes, it doesn't have a huge cache of apps to choose from, but the apps available are quality. I even found some fun games with great graphics. My music is fully loaded and the speakers are fantastic. I even tried taking a few pics and the quality is impressive! It's not great for social media. Facebook is functional but not great. Instagram and Netflix simply won't work on this tablet. You can go the Instagram website and at least view pictures, but that's all. I did manage to get YouTube working with an browser I downloaded from BlackBerry World called \"Frost\". Just go to the YouTube web page and it works great. It let me sign in, but I had to re-sign in every time I opened it. But when the videos play on YouTube, you can leave the app and the video keeps playing - very cool! I also have a BlackBerry Passport phone and it lets me sync with it and my Playbook to text and send BBMs. If you're willing to put in a little work and do some research, you can get some current Android apps working on this thing. I have Evernote, Kindle, and even a version of Google Maps working. Again, do not expect this tablet to be everything the current tablets are, but if you want to spend very little and get a functional tablet that can serve a few purposes well, give this a look. The best things about this Tablet is the multi-tasking feature, the Messaging inbox, the speakers, the quality of the screen and the price. The negatives are a lack of apps and the general slowness. Hope this helps someone!"}

I was concerned the limited apps for blackberry product, slow speed for something that was released long time ago, but just could not pass it because it was priced very reasonable. I was in search of some smart device to get my 2 year 's attention so he won't mess up with my phone all the time. Since it was for a kid, so I would not want to spend a lot of money on something that is super fancy and fast. This product seemed to be exactly what I wanted, so even a lot of people left negative review, but I still wanted to give it a try for its price and 32 GB storage. I thought if it is super slow, at least I can download some music for my son so he can use it as a MP3 player.\nHowever, after I played with it for 6 hours, I was totally in love with it. The speed is decent enough to get online, the apps are decent enough for me to choose any theme from. I am particularly impressed by its battery life, which is so much better than a lot of device I have owned, I would say it is just as good as my Ipad Air 2 I purchased 2 years ago. In fact, I am thinking about sharing with my son!\nIf I really need to say something I don't like about it, it would be the brief menu that comes with the product. The font is so small, I cant even read anything with my normal eyesight. Luckily, I didn't really need to read it and still was able to complete setting up this device."}

The weather app is nice, Bing maps on it is pretty useful. The music player is easy to use and overall the OS is very snappy and well engineered. Thanks to the MiniHDMI port I can literally use this as a basic web browsing/ email/ Excel type of computer setup. I even got a wireless mouse and keyboard. Would highly recommend to anyone looking at it, still a good tablet in 2017!"}

The battery could last an entire day or two without charging and the front and rear facing camera all shot at 1080p mp4 format. The processor has great graphics performance and the dual front facing speakers have amazing clarity and response given the size of the drivers. That being said, there was only one problem with the Blackberry Playbook....\n\nThere is very little in terms of third party applications.\n\nBlackberry has always had a problem with becoming a serious contender in the smartphone industry and this has led to the Playbooks downfall. The blackberry playbook comes with everything you need to browse, listen to music, or read ebooks. Just don't expect anything more from it though.

It was amazing at the time but turned out to be less than I expected. For this tablet 32GB is plenty - 16GB is too low, 64GB is thinking you'll use it more than you will. The camera is great for snapping quick photos and HD videos but won't match a point-and-shoot or even cameras on the new iPhones. The display is good but very small, at only 7 inches.\n\nWhat will you use the tablet for?  A great game comes pre-installed - NFS Undercover Racing Game. Tilting the tablet is steering and that's about it. Tetris also comes pre-installed which can be a good time-waster. The web browser isn't very good - probably half the power of a basic computer. The apps that will be most useful on this tablet are The Weather Network, and the games I mentioned.\n\nPick one up if you don't exactly care about staying modern. If you do - take a look at the Galaxy Tab S2. It puts this to shame."}

Blackberry's \"stab\" at the tablet market wasn't well timed, with many cheaper competitors entering the market at the same time. As a result, this premium product failed and remaining inventory was sold off at huge discounts. Now, you can still buy a \"new\" Blackberry tablets for around $100, and at this price, they are a bargain.\n\nWhat makes the Blackberry Playbook so great? Feel and function are awesome, and the screen resolution and graphic quality are second to none. Watching movies on this tablet (while flying, for instance) is a joy.\n\nI especially like two features of the Blackberry tablet: the way it handles my e-mail accounts, and the calendar function. The calendar function is the only one I have found where I can enter a recurring event on whatever frequency I want, which is perfect for my 24 hours on duty, 72 hours off duty job. Most calendars only let you repeat an event on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.\n\nI recommend the Blackberry Playbook and suggest you buy one of the \"leftovers\" while you can."}

In fact, I would not recommend you buy this tablet if that is the kind of person you are. This tablet is almost like a beginning step into the world of tablets. You get plenty of memory on the tablet for a price lower than any other competitor offer, but there is good reason for that. For one, this tablet is older than these fancy tablets that we see nowadays, so the specs aren't as hot. There is Bluetooth, but if you have an iPhone or Android or just anything that isn't a Blackberry, your phone is not going to interact with this tablet other than giving it data. It CAN'T support file sharing like pictures or music through Bluetooth, but you can plug it into your computer to upload files onto it. Apps are not exact the strong suite of the Playbook either. It has a more limited version of the Blackberry World for the Blackberry phones, so don't expect all the top of the line games and apps to be on here, through there are a few here and there. I would suggest this tablet to people who want to do some basic browsing on the web, check facebook, and just relax while on the go. I wouldn't say it is a bad tablet for getting your work done, but I don't think this is the tablet you should be relying on."}

Sighs if the blackberry is the only devise available. I wish we had sent it back right away verses trying to give them a chance because I use to love my BlackBerry phone. The tablet was suppose to be superior like the phones were when they came out. It's proven to be inferior and a waste of money."}

It wouldn't charge no matter how long I tried. After being really angry for an hour or so, I finally found the answer on you tube. Take your tablet and hook it up to a computer. Go to blackberry.com/software and download the blackberry desktop software on to your computer. Do not unplug your tablet. The desktop software will search for an update. This is software that make the hardware work. It will take about an hour to install. After install it will tell you to unplug your tablet and charge it, mine was dead. After the battery reaches 20 percent, takes forever, take it back to your computer and finish the process. Mine works GREAT now. Some blackberrys arrive fine, some arrive like mine. I replaced my playbook because my older one was breaking. The main port that the cell phone like charger goes into broke and I thought I would have to throw it away but there's another port to the right that is magnetic so I bought the blackberry playbook rapid travel charger off Amazon and I love it. I can't believe how fast it charges. I don't even use the other charger for my new one. Hope this helps."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I love RIM products, every device I have purchased has always been of the highest quality, and the Playbbok is noexception.  I am really getting frustated the way Apple and Google seem to be systematically destroying RIM by witholding crucial software, and I do not think it is an accident or some sort of programming hurdle.\n\nI resent Google the most since I am an iMac owner and am a fan of apple and even the iPhone for instance.  I do not own an iPhone but unfortunately I think I may get one soon simply because I don't have the time as I used to to spend hours coding workarounds to get apps that should be readily available.  It PISSES me off that I will give in to the pressure that Apple and Google are exerting and bow down before them simply because I am overwhelmed with how far they have gone to make it difficult to use simple apps such as Hulu or Netflix.  I do like my tablet mainly for streaming vide and browsing the web at home in the evening.\n\nThe only thing that I have found some relief with is that I can connectt directly to my Plex server and at least through that access my Movie, Music, and media collection along with a few corporate channels that are available.  Netflic used to be one of those of course.\n\nI am giving this 5 starts because it is so well made, you can just feel the quality when you hold it inyour hand, the processor speed is fantastic and it multitasks like a beast.  I would normally have removed a star because I can not get Netflix and Hulu which are my main apps for video straming, but I refuse to punish RIM for this obviously conspiracy to remove them from the competition pool.\n\nThe ONLY hope I see for RIM is if they can honestly off a device with total NSA and hacker proof encryption.  If they were to focus their entire marketing campaign on security I think they could win over millions of customers that are sick and tired of the way Android and even Apple are just handing over all of our personal data and even profiting from it (makes me want to vomit).\n\nSo listen up RIM!!!  Your busniess model needs to change and your only focus should be in security, privacy, and encryotion from every angle and commit to your customers that although the security environment is constantly evolving, they are committed to stay one step ahead of the threat of revealing your personal info on their devices.  Of course what sites you visit (facebbok, linked, etc) are on you and RIM can not help you there, but they should be able to secure your search queries, your e-mails, and your interpersonal communication like video and audio chat.\n\nSorry for the rant.\n\nTHIS IS THE BEST TABLET IMO, I just hate the lack of the most popular apps.  Do not hesitate to buy this as it is truly an amazing and beautiful device.  I am actually seriously considering my plans for a new iphone and instead going for a new Blackberry Q10 or the awesome Passport!\n\nCome on people show your support for RIM and let's keep it alove, because if we let Apple and Google win, we will have completely given up our freedom of choice in the cellular arena because the only other competitor is the MS Windows phone and IMO it's a piece of junk."}

You can use your bb phone as a mouse and keyboard. You can connect your phones carrier to your tablet to use Internet when Wifi is not available. Open many apps without having to close one first, if paired with your bb phone it let's you know when you have an incoming call or text. You can text back from the tablet too.

When I bought my 32GB, it was still fairly new. Even though the reviews here are high, I should have dug elsewhere. If it weren't for the fact I get attached to electronics, this review would be even lower. This tablet is complete crap, and though I personally wouldn't return mine if I had the chance, that's only due to the sentimental value. I do not suggest buying this tablet, as within three months of usage, it was already having problems. Three years later, the sound is jacked up and only sometimes works, it randomly crashes out of apps, it's headphone jack is apparently broken, and it's literally falling apart. As in, the back is trying to peel itself off. My tablet hasn't gotten an update for about a year, and it will refuse to register being tapped. These are just somethings I remember for issues. Also, if you plan on using Skype, don't bother. The only Skype compatible apps on it are gone, last I checked."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Despite the lack of support from many haters of this device in the market, I've owned (and given away) a total of five of these devices. It can do everything that it gets support for as well as any device in the market. If you're looking to be able to watch NetFlix on this, you will be disappointed. Because Netflix doesn't support Blackberry at all (thank goodness Blackberry found a way to beat that in their BB OS 10.2.1 and higher). I used to be able to play amazon prime videos on it but Amazon has since pulled support for the playbook as well. The playbook is a workhorse though. If you are looking to use this device for productivity, you will like it just fine. It has just the right apps that you probably need for your productive tasks. It also has just enough of the fun. Except for NetFlix, I have never found myself disappointed looking for an app that I need from my BlackBerry Playbook's BlackBerry World app store. The Video Chat app on the playbook is excellent as well. I get in contact with the people I distributed PlayBooks to through this app and we all love it. The field that the camera for the playbook captures is perfect for multiple people chatting on both ends. It was probably designed with a boardroom table in mind but it works great when you're trying to chat with your whole family on the other end as well.\n\nThere's been a problem with the rear view camera of my playbooks recently though. It's as if a switch has just been turned off on it. It just stopped working and would display an error message or cut my calls whenever I switch to the rear view camera during the calls. I'm still not sure what happened but it used to work just fine. My hunch is an app I installed could have messed it up.\n\nAt any rate, I do not regret making the decision to buy this. And especially at it's current price, I would not hesitate to buy one again if I have to."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "This review is worth more than this tablet. I promise.\n\nI knew blackberry wasn't very good when I was reading up on this tablet. But something told me to give it a chance. I read countless reviews and it was surprising to see how many people liked. The main topic that was coming up in every review was the screen. In every review the screen was supposedly so great it put others to shame. From my opinion that is pretty much true. From the second I turned on the tablet it was a shocker how a device made several years ago could look better than the devices we have today. The sad part is. it had to be blackberry. The worst OS I had ever used. If it wasn't for the screen then I would chunk it. The battery life and camera are just a couple of things that makes this tablet worth a few more dollars than the cents it's worth. I know it sounds harsh coming from someone who is used to android and iOS there whole life. But seriously I never stopped loving android or apple products once. And I can say I never started loving Rim products ever. What makes apple and android and even a windows system that is starting to compete better than rim. Is there App Store. Rim has no App Store. basically the few games and apps that is available and is actually known and certified has a price. And those apps are free everywhere else. I'm glad I had a chance to learn from my mistakes and hopefully I can prevent you from making one. Do not buy this tablet. Besides the screen and battery. This tablet(idk if it's worthy of the name) is junk. And with it not having a memory card slot. Your life is pretty much over. Chromebooks users beware. There is no software to move music or pictures to this tablet. And it's so difficult with a windows computer I ended up spending 5hrs trying to download the actual software I needed to have. I know this is old technology(compared to now) but the updates they do have are just for show. It's no different than the previous updates available. Android and apple had been improving greatly since the past few years. And even windows has wowed me with it's windows 8. And the reason for that is because the competition it has against the other top electronics companies. Too bad for Rim. It never was a threat to anything but misguided buyers and their hard earned money.  I may never buy a product with blackberry on it again unless they have made a vast improvement. You can only do so much with a great screen and battery. And it shows in this tablet. As soon as I started realizing I made a mistake. I tried to find a way to use this tablet as much as i can. But there is no netflix app and YouTube app is the worst ever. The keypad is ok but there is no voice search and the browser is terrible. I may be completely wrong about the tablet. But I'm not wrong about what I like and this is something I do not like."}

I leave it on to record any conversation I think I might need back up on and it is excellent. So is its camera and video recorder produce outstanding quality. I can instantly email great copies from it.\n\nIt easily picks up and stores Wi FI codes.  I use it as a cell phone when I travel and I video chat with all my friends that have one all over the globe. It is our free video phone.\n\nI am not usually this fond of discontinued items, but the 64G is nice. If Black berry had more apps and could get DirecTV, I would use it more often. I definitely recommend this for those about to travel abroad. Get two and leave one with anyone who you want to rely on if you have an emergency or that special someone you wish to share your experiences with via video. It cost us nothing to do this when I talked with my friend daily  when she was vacationing in Italy.\n\nYou can buy the 16Gs so cheap it is ridiculous not to do it.

Anytime one can purchase a $500 electronic device for a fraction of that price . . . and it is of the highest quality and performs exactly as advertised . . . what is not to like?  I have been a loyal Blackberry customer for decades.  Blackberry has been at the top of the market, and though they are now at the bottom . . . the quality and distinctiveness and niche expertise is still there.  The Apples and Samsungs of the world serve the childish game players and social media sheeple, but the Blackberry remains the brand of  choice for the business world and serious media users who require a secure enterprise solution.  This unit is the perfect size for air travel and takes care of business uses.  No more do you need to lug around a heavy laptop on those short day trips.  Combined with your tethered (via wireless bluetooth) Blackberry phone, this unit will provide the size screen and operating system you need for all your enterprise needs.  If you are looking for a tablet to play all the latest childish game apps, then go ahead and spend hundreds more and buy an Apple or Samsung.  If you are a businessman who needs a secure, quality enterprise tablet that really opens up the utility of your Blackberry 4G phone, at a fraction of the price, then get a Playbook."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I purchased two (2) BlackBerry playbooks - One for me and one for a work colleague of mine. The goal was to be able to do the various tasks of managing email, meetings and presentations on our playbook as we met with customers. The product worked well for the first few weeks we used it.\n\nSoon there after, BlackBerry sent an update on the device and now my Playbook has turned into a *brick*. I get a red light and five green lights when I turn on the device.\n\nI reached out to BlackBerry support and they are asking me to purchase support, without even suggesting paths to fix the problem. The problem started when I did a BlackBerry Playbook softwware update, so I would think the support team would atleast consider my request.\n\nThe number of applications on the playbook are also weaning. The promise of using Android apps on the Playbook has not come to bear and developers are moving away from developing applications on the playbook. Unless the BlackBerry browser on the Playbook improves so that websites can be viewed much better and quicker, the browser would be another disappointment.\n\nAll in all, I am disappointed I purchased this device. I had high hopes for the dual camera Playbook. With the limited apps and games, it is not usable as anything but a paper weight. Thanks for taking the time to read this review."}

A $500 tablet for $110?  Total bargain!\n\nThis really was for businesses and people who want to do actual work with their tablet, and it does that wonderfully.  It has Adobe Reader, plus an app that let's you send files directly to the tablet, and apps for reading and writing word and excel documents.  It also has a great autocorrect system that allows me to type very quickly, which helps a lot since touch screens are a pain to type with normally, but I think I could actually be productive with this. In fact, this entire review was typed with it and I think it's been quite fast, maybe faster than a real keyboard with my chicken peck typing.\n\nSo it is great for actual computer things. But it doesn't have much else going for it, sadly.  It has quite a few apps, but not even close to what Apple or Android can offer.  I would expect even Windows has a better app selection.  And with RIM cutting support for the PlayBook recently, I expect few developers will have interest in developing more apps.  You can always port Android apps to it, but I think few people want to go to the trouble of doing that.\n\nIn short, this is a great tablet for people who want to get work done with a tablet (for some reason),and really is an all around wonderful tablet, but it just doesn't have the support like other tablets do which is an issue for many."}

It probably would have been a very good tablet had it not arrived D.O.A., and if it had come with a standard 110v U.S. charger. (It came with what looks like a 220v plug. If that was mentioned in the description, I missed it.) I had bought a pod charger to go with it, and tried charging it with that, as I was unsure if the Playbook was really dead or just had a drained battery. After several hours, the device still would not power on. I can only conclude that the Playbook is dead. (And that it was sent out untested.) This was a used item that was sold by Blind Man Sound through Amazon Warehouse Deals. I will think twice next time about ordering a used electronic device and also about ordering from either Amazon Warehouse Deals or Blind Man Sound.

You can use wi-fi or it tethers to your Blackberry. For convenience, with Blackberry bridge, you can open the files from your phone (memos, pictures, docs). You can also open emails and texts through bridge if wi-fi is not available. Overall, a very decent tablet."}

I am planning to use it as a secondary tablet. So I looked into it and found a lot of negative review but also quite a few fans.

I actually bought two (2) devices (one for my husband and the other for myself). Initially because of my inexperience and because blackberry is so popular in Jamaica I thought it was absolutely the best thing. However, after owning a galaxy S2 and a samsung tab 3 8 inch and experimenting with android I now know that blackberry is years behind in technology.\nFurther, both devices have issues with charging, something I googled and check on blackberry forums and found to be quite a common problem with the device. When RIM customer support was contacted apart from lying, they offered no solution and instead sent me to amazon where I bought the device instead. Totally unfair after collecting US$300 for a device now worth half that amount.\nRIM was a great fore runner in the smart phone market but the truth is the companies restrictiveness and inability to move with the time and give customers what they want has made them nothing better than a relic. I can assure you that this company will certain disappear shortly and be forgotten very soon.\nMy suggestion explore Ipad or samsung if you need a good tablet. Forget RIM, blackberry playbook is just that a joke only to be used for playing!"}

It does just about anything my laptop can do but is so much more portable, and the screen size is perfect. It does everything I need.  Facebook, Twitter, Kindle, GPS, YouTube, Instagram, radio, MP3s, videos, games, documents, calendars, planners, etc. The sound & video quality is awesome and I have all my mp3s & videos loaded on it.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "First of all I bought this product thinking it was brand new but instead what I got was a blackberry playbook 64gb NOT in original box and without any of accessories that comes with such as the sleeve and usb and instead it came in a cheap white gift box that didn't securely hold the unit inside. As for the charger its not the right playbook charger it came with a small blackberry charger rated 800mah (original playbook charger rated 1800mah and with yellow usb tip)as for the unit itself it had me wonder if this is a refurbished unit and looks like new but it was clean with no scratches but surely was stored somewhere for a reallg long time since battery was completely drained and wasn't able to get anything out of it. After charging for 4 hours the battery got up from zero % to 2% and then it charged normally to 100 % in 1 hour 30 minutes just as it should (this is what happens when a unit is left for long period with battery completely drained) overall since this is my second playbook I was really disapointed with it but in fairness to the unit itself once I powered it up after solving the battery issue and updated to the latest version OS it ran as it should and had no signs of problems."}

My motivation was the extremely good price for a very nice tablet. Unfortunately the item that arrived had (and still has) following problems :\n\n1. Charging led always on\n2. Battery charge up to only 77-78%\n3. No chance to change screen brightness (the virtual trigger seems off)\n4. Yellowish screen instead of the great white that I was used to on my old Playbook\n\nI asked Blackberry for help but nothing happened because the don't have a support center in Greece!\nPossible problem on battery and light sensor.\nPrice was very good but finally no price is good enough if the item is problematic."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "So I bought this to use for school. I was looking for a tablet that could get me through a solid two/three years of college with out breaking the bank. I have been grateful I ran across the Blackberry Playbook. It is perfect for what I need.\n\nPros:\n  -Solid construction: won't break when dropped from considerable heights without case (i've dropped it from about seven feet without its case a few times and it only came up with two small scratches in the corner cause I dropped it concrete)\n  -Memory: Memory on this is crazy. I can have like every Breaking Bad episode on this bad boy and still have room left, I love the memory availability on this baby. I have 32 GB and it plenty enough. I love this aspect of the Playbook\n  -Camera/Video: Honestly it is pretty up there compared to most tablets. I don't realize a problem with this at all. I am an avid photographer and although I don't use the tablet for taking pictures, I do on occasion with great success.\n  -Can run many programs at once, which is really helpful, like really, for me cause I use it for school.\n  -Price: Since the Blackberry Playbook has not hit the market like what was expected, the price of it has dropped by hundreds and you'll be getting a good quality tablet for the price\n  -The Playbook has programs similar to Microsoft's Word, Excel, and Powerpoint, so for me it was a breeze editing and looking through powerpoint slides, writing notes, and looking through spreadsheets that I need for college.\n\nCons:\n  - Apps: The Blackberry store for the Playbook is absolutely horrible. Nothing compared to other android tablets. But this isn't a real problem for me because I really only use the Playbook for note-taking and surfing the internet, facebook, etc. There are some games and other decent apps, but I would research the different types of apps you'd want before buying this product. Again, for me, not a problem, but for avid gamers, it may pose a problem.\n  - Software: This tablet is a few years old and has since fell off the band wagon so-to-say, so there are no more OS updates for this tablet, so you're stuck at the current version. Which is not too much of a problem, because the current version is fine. It's not slow, even when several programs are running at once.\n\nOverall, I would buy this product all over again if I had to. I fulfilled all my needs and then some. The only draw backs are the apps, and the fact it's a few years old. Other then that, perfect."}

The blackberry apps are lame and terribly slow, half the time they don't work.  Everything I wanted to do I couldn't.  I would try to photoshop  a pix, and it wouldn't save.  Halfway through the process it would freeze up.  I couldn't even create playlists with their lousy app after spending  hours downloading my music.  The audio books app has the lousiest selection of book I never heard of.  So please, take your money and buy an android tablet from someone else, you will be glad you spent the extra money doing so. The final straw was when I cracked the screen, the entire tablet doesn't even work.  Getting simple games like yhatzee and solitaire took forever.  I can't believe there is nothing I can say positive about the money I wasted on this product. I can see why  Blackberry who once ruled the smart phone market has sunk to the bottom of the heap."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I recieved this a few months ago in excellent condition & am quite pleased with everything. The operating system is superb and took only a few minutes to learn since only a few different swipes are needed to do anything. OS is definitely ahead of android and ios - rock solid stable(no crashes yet), no buttons necessary only swipes(except for power and volume), extremely intuitive and easy to learn,  very fluid and snappy since qnx OS is lighter and more elegant  than android or ios(uses processor more efficiently), etc. videos look superb as color balance is perfect and resolution seems quite sharp even though its less than most new tablets. remember the playbook uses flash where android and ios can not, so websites look great just as they would on a desktop computer. in fact i have no doubt that the playbook has the best web browsing experience of any tablet(tip-download origami browser from blackberry world for best browsing experience). the audio is superb - at least as good if not better than any other tablet with the two front positioned speakers. touch control is excellent as well - very responsive. the virtual keyboard is at least as good if not better than any other tablet. the build quality is superb - better than most other tablets including the ipad. very tough glass which can not be scratched easily. it has very good battery life(tip-buy travel charger with it and you won't have the problems charging that many have).\n  only weak point is in fact the somewhat limited app selection although i have to say you can use the spare phone app from blackberry world for audio only phone calls in place of skype and it works very well(you'll need to open a gmail account and set up google voice since it is based on that).\n  difficult to understand the negative reviews except must be people who can't learn the swipe controls(really, a young child should be able to do this), some with heavy app needs could be dissapointed, some get a used/defective one from unreliable merchants, and others have trouble charging with the supplied inferior usb charger - get the travel or base charger and it will work magnificently."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "When I purchased this tablet, it was the only reasonably priced tablet at 64GB bar none. There are limited apps for this bad boy. You can get android apps which have been converted online. But they are limited and don't always work. Common apps like hangouts, tango, viber, etc have significant problems. AND, in order to get them on your tablet, you have to download them to your PC and use a program to put them on the tablet. It not that outrageously difficult to do. But if you want a stand alone tablet that can download lots of apps without issue, this one isn't for you. Further, there is no expandable memory. Finally, no external battery chargers have yet worked on this device and it will not power an external hard drive.\n\nFor what it does, it does it beautifully. The space is, of course, significant. The screen looks great and movies look amazing. It has a micro sd and micro usb connection. So if all you need to do is check email and watch movies in a nice looks 8 inch tablet it's great.\n\nShortly thereafter we had tablets for maybe $100 more that had android systems.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I am going to provide as honest a review as possible.  The only thing I would caution potential buyers about is be as aware as I was that there are practically very few apps for this device.  That being said those that do exist; such as the Facebook app, don't really work well or are limited in their features.  The OS and the overall device functionality are all quite above average.  The design really leaves nothing to be desired.  I think Blackberry did a great job with this tablet.  I saw an earlier review that made reference to a poor battery life.  Well, I bought mine refurbished and I still have not had any battery life issues.  Quite the contrary, I have been surprised by how long I can go without charging it.  And the sound from the speakers is better than I expected as well.  The movies I have been ABLE to download from Blackberry's video store have really shown the excellent HD capability of the screen.\n\nI am giving this unit 4 stars instead of 5; not because of the unit itself (fair or unfair,) but because of Blackberry World.  I've seen a lot of people come to the defense of this poor excuse for an app store and they made reference to the beginnings of the Apple Iphone.  Well, yeah, that was years ago my friend.  Before the explosion that has caused the Iphone and other touchscreen devices must have items.  Blackberry's launch was late in the game and therefore it should have been more successful at executing a \"ready to run\" launch.  But the apps available are far below the standards I've seen available on my Apple and Android devices.  I knew this would be the case going in.  I knew it was going to be bad, I didn't know it would be this bad!  Some of the apps available aren't reminders of the beginnings of the touchscreen era; but reminders of the beginnings of the computing era.\n\nThe primary reason I bought the device is to be able to watch movies, listen to music, play a few games and browse the internet (where possible) on my flights on a larger screen than either of my phones.  It has done well with that so far.  But come on, stop with the attacking folks who are disappointed in the lack of quality in the Blackberry World app store.  A path to success was already carved out for them; all they had to do was follow it.  And they didn't.  They have a racehorse of a device here, they really need to do something to get it out of the stables."}

Games are the same way.\n\nBottom line: Lack of apps hurt an otherwise great device. If it could have a Google Play app, ( hint hint RIM) problems solved."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "The Blackberry Playbook is one of the best built tablets I've ever come across.  The screen is sharp, the operating system never crashes, and most importantly it allows you to have control over the applications you install.  In other words (hello, Android, Apple) you can put apps on the Playbook and actually deselect some of the privileges that they may have.  In other words, your weather app won't be able to phone home every time you send an email for instance.  There is a downside: RIM has lost the tablet war in terms of market share and the there simply aren't as many apps available for this device as there are for an iPad or Android tablet.  However, with the security issues inherent in the Android platform - and a comparable Apple product costing 5-6 times as much, the Playbook still makes sense for some (and particularly if you have a Blackberry phone)."}

My motivation to purchase was to use it as a work companion to my Blackberry Z10 smartphone and take advantage of the internet tethering, email capabilities, and text messaging allowed via the Z10's Blackberry Bridge app.\n\nHowever, I have been pleasantly surprised by the other uses I have found including watching movies and streaming television on my TV via the hdmi output, installing and playing quite a few excellent games, using the Print to Go feature to open files stored on my phone, and taking photos and videos with the camera. This tablet is used daily and has been confiscated by my children who have found even more uses than me. So, I just purchased another for myself!\n\nThe only issue I had was the charger that came with it did not work. I called Blackberry customer service and they ended up exchanging my defective charger for a premium rapid charger at no additional cost. I was extremely happy with this outcome."}

The \"side-loading\" of specially-configured Android apps is often required to add certain functionality, and many of these apps are buggy and unstable on the PlayBook's Android runtime environment. Still, the PlayBook is a fairly reliable tablet for everyday activities such as web browsing, email, music, eBook reading, and even gaming. The Documents to Go office suite comes pre-installed, as does Adobe reader, and a functional version of the Kindle for Android app can be installed via the previously mentioned \"side-loading\".

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "UPDATE: It is now June 2016 and I still love my PlayBook. Many people shoot them down for a lack of apps but since I am an old fashioned person that is more concerned with security than the newest bells and whistles, then, I'm good. I have a laptop for whatever my tablet can't do which is not that much. Some people complain about the native browser but there are several other browsers on the BlackBerry app site that can be installed. I prefer OrigamiBrowser because it has a desktop mode and is very fast. I did purchase a new case that comes with a wireless keyboard and that made things even better. I'll stick with this tablet until some other \"reasonably priced\" operating system such as Windows 10 is proven more reliable and comes on a well-made tablet. I don't trust anything to do with the android system because it is too easy to be hacked or for apps to  run amuck in the background, have access to all of your personal information and be able to copy and or remove it without you even being aware...I even had one app on an android turn itself on, connect to the internet and back up a copy of all my stuff even though I had it set not to do that.\n\nUnlike Android, BlackBerry products are more secure because you can limit the access that apps can have to your tablet/cell. Now some apps won't work if you limit their access but I've found that there are enough ported Android apps configured just for this tablet on BlackBerry App World that I can usually find one to purchase at a very low price ($2 - $4) and sometimes for free that will accept the restrictions that I put in place for it. I purchased two of these, one for myself and one as a gift for a relative that's in college. She says that she loves hers, especially since it came with such a large hard drive (64GB) and she doesn't have to be concerned with flash drives, sd cards and such. We both like the built in Video Chat that allows us to talk face to face over wifi without using a phone or using up minutes or requiring 4G and I love the fact that I was able to purchase each tablet for only $188 a piece!\n\nI'm somewhat familiar with this system because I've owned BlackBerry phones for the last several years and can do all kinds of neat things between my phone and tablet such as linking them and sharing files between them and or my PC by bluetooth and wifi because the phone files show up right on the tablet and vice versa and I can use the print to file app to send files from my PC to the tablet over wifi/bluetooth and vise versa. I can also use my phone as a remote control for the tablet. There have been two upgrades since we've had these. The first was immediate and was an upgrade to the newest OS and the second was back in September and was for stability and performance of an app...I believe it was something to do with Adobe Reader. Now I just need to get one of the new BlackBerry Q10 phones and it'll all be gravy.\n\nTo sum things up, we're pleased with performance, security and price!"}

I called Blackberry customer support team at 1-877-644-8410 and experienced the biggest waste of my time ever... I can simply say I would have had a better experience being slapped in the face multiple time...their customer support team should be called profit retention team, because they did not help me beyond pissing me off. Rude is the best word I can say about them. I later called their corporate office in the United States at 972-373-1700 for help and the best help I got from them was transferring me back to the hellish experience I called them to complain about. That probably explain why their products once favored in the marketplace is now the least of all others being sold.\n\nIf you are looking to buy this product, please don't waste your time and money, because you will certainly regret why you made that mistake of purchasing a product made by a has-been company without a likely chance of coming back... That is probably why the idea of product support and customer support is a lost concept at their company.

It promised full internet and tons of storage for my mp3s, my two greatest tablet needs. I like it, but when I tried to play video from ATT U-verse -- no. You must have Microsoft Silverlight installed to steam their free videos. Silverlight can't be installed on a playbook :( I've had it happen on a few other sites and am disappointed, since FULL INTERNET to me meant streaming videos. I'm not into tech stuff and didn't know about this until I ran into the problem.\n\nThe front and rear cameras are fun and the audio playback is wonderful! My friend and I horse around with video chat, even though we work in the same building. I downloaded a couple of fun free app games - the choices are nothing compared to other providers, but apps aren't central to everyone. I also love how the onscreen keyboard is spaced out so I don't hit 3 keys at once.\n\nIt does most of what I'd like.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I couldn't help but pick up this tablet at that price for a 64GB unit. How could I resist? Well, I went ahead and bought it and I do like and dislike a few things about it.\n\nI really love the hardware quality of this tablet. It feels so whole and sturdy. This is the first BlackBerry device I've ever used, and I can see why they have such a loyal fanbase even in this day and age when Google, Apple, and Microsoft are eating away at their market share. I especially love the play/pause button on top of the tablet. That's quite useful. The matte finish on the back of the unit really gets me, because I love matte finishes on high quality devices. It certainly does not feel cheap, either. This is a well-put together tablet, and BlackBerry is even nice enough to include a neoprene sleeve with your PlayBook to give it basic protection.\n\nI was a little surprised at the lack of buttons for functions like forward or home, but I got used to the gestures rather quickly. They make a lot of sense, or at least for the most part (swiping from the bottom upward to close the app drawer is the only gesture that makes no sense to me, because swiping from the top down when the app drawer is open only opens the (very useful) settings drawer).\n\nThe built-in apps are polished and well-made. Browser is very reliable, as well as the onboard camera, file manager, picture browser, video player, and more. It also does a wonderful job with my calendar sync and it syncs my contacts and emails quite well. Standby battery life is also very excellent. I had it sitting in my messenger bag for the past 8 hours and it still has 92% battery left from light use. The built-in keyboard is quite nice and makes a very nice, loud, satisfying tap sound when you press a key. When you type in certain apps or in the browser, the keyboard opens up this prediction system that reminds me of SwiftKey on Android, which is also rather nice.\n\nThe built-in storage amount is by far the best feature of this tablet to me. So much space for so many videos, songs, and pictures. It's wonderful. You can go crazy with 64GB of storage. I have several videos in the .wmv format inside of it right now, but there's definitely more space available, and other supported formats. You could also use that space for games, which BlackBerry World seems to have no shortage of, as far as I can tell.\n\nNow, there are a few things I dislike about the item, but that doesn't necessarily mean I don't like the item as a whole.\n\nFirst of all, the app selection is awful and even non-existent to some degree. A lot of big names are completely absent on this platform for some reason. No official Dropbox, Netflix, Springpad, Kindle, nook, Pandora, Feedly, and a whole lot of other apps are missing. On a platform like Windows 8 or Windows Phone 8, whenever there's no official app, there's at least a very good third party app that is good enough or even better. That is not the case on the BlackBerry Playbook. If there's no app, chances are you have a questionable third-party app that actually costs money and has bad reviews, or nothing at all. You can sideload .bar files, but judging by the ported apps I've tried, they barely work or are poorly optimized for the PlayBook. It makes me wish people other than just game developers had given the PlayBook more of a chance. The hardware is definitely nice, but the software support from third parties was definitely not there.\n\nI also own a Nexus 7, and the app selection on the PlayBook (unfortunately) pales in comparison. I think that's a shame as well, because I like the look and feel of the PlayBook's hardware more. I don't play a lot of games, either, but it seems like the apps that are most plentiful on the PlayBook (or just about any tablet) are the games. There's even a few preinstalled on the PlayBook, like Tetris or Need For Speed, in case you want to get used to the UI on it.\n\nI'm not a fan of the security on the tablet, either. I'm not talking about stuff like viruses or any of that. No, BlackBerry's very much on the ball when it comes to that kind of security. The security I'm talking about is locking the tablet. If you have a Nexus 7, iPad, or just about any other device, you can set up a convenient and rather easy way to unlock the device so that only the owner or those who know the password/pin/pattern can get access. Well, if you only like password lock screens, then you will have no problem at all with the PlayBook. This is the only way to lock the device, to my knowledge. I looked around in the settings and can't find anything else. Instead of being able to quickly press a few numbers, or draw out a pattern, I have to use the entire keyboard and type something out, and after that, reach for the \"OK\" or \"Enter\" key. You can just use a pin for the password, but it's still more effort than it needs to be. I wish this required a bit less effort, although it's not a deal killer for me. It's partly a problem because this is a tablet instead of a smartphone, so the screen is bigger and takes more effort to type a simple password on.\n\nLastly, some of the UI is a bit counter-intuitive to me, or at least at first. This is my first BlackBerry device, and I am willing to admit if I just found it counter-intuitive because I'm unfamiliar with BlackBerry's UI standards. It took me a while to figure out how to set a wallpaper for the tablet. I kept searching the settings thinking it had to be close, until a Google search showed me I had to go to the pictures app and do it from there. Also, it seems like to get settings on any app, you need to swipe from the top down, which isn't too obvious unless you've used the tablet for a long time or just already know what to expect.\n\nAlthough this tablet has shortcomings and is aging a bit, it is still an unbeatable value for its storage and out-of-box media capabilities. Good luck finding a new 64GB tablet at that price. I store tons of video on mine and use it primarily as a dedicated media tablet. For media playback and capabilities, this tablet is more than adequate for the job. Just don't count on using too many apps. If you want to watch videos, play music, or look at pictures on the go, and you want a lot of storage to do so, go for the PlayBook. You won't be disappointed you did.\n\nEDIT: I've been using it a bit more lately with sideloaded apps I've put into the tablet myself. Some of these are a bit wonky to get working (older versions, free apps only, etc.), but some of them do work great or good enough. RetroArch works perfectly on the PlayBook (to my knowledge, I haven't actually opened up a ROM in it), and the Dropbox app I sideloaded as a .bar file works fine, too. But the strangest thing is that you probably need to sideload apps to get quality compared to the ported apps on BlackBerry World. For example, I use Electro Droid on my Android devices, and there's an app called Electro Tools in BlackBerry World that looks like a ported app. The ported app in BBW is terrible and barely works at all, but if you sideload Electro Droid as a .bar file, it works perfectly.\n\nSadly, you can't sideload everything on this tablet. I've tried sideloading SpringPad twice already, but it doesn't even show up on my apps list. Still, your results may vary on this, but it's quite capable on running sideload apps. I partly wish that sideloading didn't require setting a password on this tablet (a password is required for using the tablet in development mode, which you need to sideload anything)."}

It's frozen about three times in TWO YEARS. The charge last a couple hours, and it charges incredibly fast with the cheapest chargers. The app store has a huge selection of apps & games, including freebies and premiums. There's a variety of settings, and you can run up to (from my own experience) 10 programs at a time. The graphics are incredible, and the camera is supremely awesome. The sound sounds really great, and it goes loud enough to hear it over the t.v. This is so worth 600 dollars, and if you're lucky you can get it cheaper.\nI recommend you purchase this asap."}

I've always liked Blackberry and am somewhat saddened by their fall from grace. I bought the device just to see what it was like after several dramatic price cuts. It's good, but it is not special. I also have an iPad that I disliked at first, but after buying the Playbook I find the iPad experience to be better. I've also played with Samsung's tablets and like them better than the iPad. The screen size is too small, which I knew going into the purchase. I feel that any device with 7-inch screen is not worth it. Playbook is pretty heavy and I don't like that either, but some people might find the weight difference marginal. The Blackberry App World is small and there isn't a single one that I have bought. The device now serves as an expensive web-browser for me, something I already get from my Kindle Fire and iPad. A final thought, the navigation around the menus and especially certain apps is not quite intuitive. I have found myself very confused and frustrated trying to exit a screen that doesn't have an exit button for me (the device itself doesn't have a home button either, something common with other tablets)...the exit is all in the swipe...somewhere...if you just know where the swipe spot is... Bottomline, I would recommend holding off until the device is much cheaper or just pay-up and get a competing device. Google Nexus, Samsung Tab or Apple iPad aren't much more expensive and the user experience is better."}

The final nail in the coffin is the app store.  No way to use any e-reader except the pre-loaded Kobo; no way to read Kindle books via the tablet's browser; no apps for CNN, USA Today, TripIt, Safeway, etc etc etc.  I knew the app store was weak compared to Apple and Android -- but THIS is ridiculous.

Second, the applications are not very well behaved; they freeze a lot. Third, the touch screen is not as smooth and sensitive as that of the iPad or the Samsung. And then, the issue of running Android apps is not entirely true: the way it works is that the new version of the OS has an app that converts the Android apps to Blackberry apps, and those converted apps is what you can run on the Playbook, but not all the Android apps can be converted.  There is a Website that has Android apps already converted, which can be downloaded ready to use, and their people say that they attempted to convert over 3000 apps, but they were able to convert barely 1000, which is roughly 30%. The rest they could not convert.  And of those that they were able to convert, some are only partially usable.\n\nThe summary of my post is that RIM has not been able to take full advantage of the great OS that is QNX, and made a less than desirable tablet.

Next thing I noticed was the increadible, deep rich colors of the display. Even two years later, it compares to an HD display of a new tablet. It is still quick in processing data and memory allocation is well designed. I have, after two years had to retire my Android as it became slow and buggy. My playbook is as efficient as it was when new. I am going to purchase a 64 Gb model before they are gone.\n Now for the reason I subtracted a star... The power and volume buttons on top are almost even with the casing and can be hard to manipulate. The designers would have been well advised to make them a millimeter higher and slightly of a better quality. Also, being a sealed unit, you can not add more memory in the format of a micro usb memory chip nor is there a connector for headphone/earbuds.\n However, this tablet was made for work, crunching numbers or entertaining yourself. With the new operating system (version 2) many of the design flaws have been corrected.

Ordered this unit, along with an otter-box case for my new phone about a week ago. When I received the package I opened the box and found my two items, everything initially looked fine. When I tried charging my Playbook the red light came on, so I figured it was charging, and I walked away. Came back more than 4 hours later, and the light was no longer on. So I thought it was finished charging, but when I pushed the power button the red light came on for a few seconds and then turned green, blinked three times, went out, the device never started up. I assumed that maybe the power cord was loose, so I made sure everything was tight and secure, the light came back on, and I walked away to let it charge again. When I came back two hours later and tried turning it on, the same thing happened as before. When I went back to try and read the manually and see if I was doing something wrong, I noticed a few little scratches on the individual package for the playbook, and when I turned it over to further inspect it, I noticed the whole back side was scuffed/torn up. And the packaging I am talking about is for the individual Playbook, not the other box it was in with my phones case. This unit Was DOA (Dead on Arrival). So either Sunset Electronics shippped a lemon to Amazons warehouse, or someone in Amazon shipping/receiving damaged the unit (which is very possible based on the condition of the playbook package).\n\nAs for the overall feel of the tablet, its kind of bulky, not something you can really hold with one hand.\n\nSo today I am returning this unit to amazon (who should be giving me a full refund + shipping costs), and I have to also get a refund from squaretrade, because I did not damage this unit I am not going to need the extra insurance I order because it should be covered by amazon, Sunset Electronics, or at least Black Berry.\n\nLastly, I was under the impression that Black Berry made good reliable products, but after this I would never buy a BB again.(FYI I did have a blackberry curve up until I could upgrade my phone, and that was a piece of crap too.)"}

Before we gave it to him I fully charged it and pre-loaded it with all his music  a bunch of free apps so he could use it right after opening it. I love that it has internet capabilities, e-book options, mp3, movies, and apps- all for a pretty reasonable price. Much better than buying him a laptop, and totally portable. I did ship around looking at all the other tablets and finally settled on this one- not just for the great price and tons of things it offers, but also how many stellar reviews there were on it. I tend to check out the bad ones first to see what the heart of the complaint is, and this really didn't seem to have any that were actually related to the product itself.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I use the playbook as an adjunct to my Blackberry phone, which is in its third year and functions fine but is not very versatile compared to the fancier new phones.  I use it mostly for work (the phone) so the playbook expands what I can do.  I've added work apps for work scheduling and note keeping while I also enjoy quickly and easily checking on sports scores and the weather and news headlines.  If you like me have had to give up \"upgrades\" to adult children while you wait out their needs and are about 10 months from a new upgrade, the playbook makes an old Blackberry phone more attractively useful.  The playbook functions fine to make notes at meetings while also discretely keeping track of emails or texts.  Mine was refurbished and is excellent."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I purchased my Playbook 64 GB version on Amazon.com about seven months ago and have basically been very impressed with it as a tool for doing online grad school course work. With no real muss or fuss, my Playbook lets me get into the FULL version of my grad school's course room in order to paste my course posts into the course room from the Docs to Go word processor it comes with. Additionally, the version of Acrobat Reader is first rate: PDF files for class open quite nicely and can easily be re-sized by making an expanding motion with two fingers so as to view peer-reviewed journal articles for class.\n\nThe front- and rear-facing cameras take some decent quality photos, where you can zoom in before snapping your pic. While not Single Lens Reflex (SLR) quality, the pics you take are not terribly grainy. All in all, this is a nice feature that competes nicely with a much pricier Microsoft Surface tablet, for instance.\n\nThe Playbook's digital voice recorder is first-rate. I've made a couple of digital voice recordings off an audio cassette player/recorder connected to some good-quality Logitech speakers and was very favourably impressed by the (apparently) stereo microphone's sensitivity - and, subsequently, the unit's playback via its own built-in stereo speakers (which do give my Kindle Fire's speakers a run for their money in terms of quality of sound output).\n\nThe BlackBerry World shop is an excellent ecosystem that impresses me as being comparably secure to Amazon's for their Kindle Fire/HD lines of products. You can find additional apps covering anything from medicine to computer games, to general reference texts and apps to enhance the Playbook's functionality. (Since I'm not a gamer, I make no comment on the games available for the Playbook.)\n\nThe Playbook has Bluetooth connectivity, which means you can connect devices such as a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse (something which I've been known to do on occasion), in effect making it *almost* a laptop, just in a deconstructed form. If you live somewhere where people can relate to desktop and laptop computers, you'll see some heads turn in a coffee shop when you set up a Playbook to work almost like a laptop, in part because of its cool, sleek design.\n\nMy Playbook is ruggedly built and has a very sensitive capacitive touch screen. If you want something that will last you, look at a Playbook and you will not be disappointed.\n\nThe only really substantive issue I've had with my Playbook is the fact that the versions of Docs to Go and Acrobat Reader use a search engine that works fine for finding recently created and/or viewed files, but for my grad school uses I have to create folders in order to keep both my course work and course materials organised. The best solution I've found is an app that I recall being called File Folders in BlackBerry World for a bit over US $3.00 (tax included) that basically works like My Computer in Windows XP, for instance. With it, files that I email myself and end up on the Playbook's Temp folder (after downloading them) that's buried within the tablet's apparently Android-based operating system (OS). This app allows me to move such files over into the proper folder for grad school.\n\nWhat's rather quirky about the Playbook is the fact that I've had a deuce of a time getting the BlackBerry Desktop and self-install from the Playbook software to work on my netbook's 64-bit version of Windows 8. However, for my old Mac laptop with a Power PC chip running OS 10.5, the Playbook's self-install software worked like a charm, so copying and pasting files for grad school is no big deal all the same.\n\nBottom line: If the only real quirk about using my Playbook is the last item mentioned above, I can say it's a pretty good unit indeed."}

So i have a dead playbook which is still under warranty and which i already sent back to be fixed and it was not. No one wants to give me any satisfaction, the seller is telling me to send it back, amazon is telling me it to late to make a claim to them.

If you are into that kind of thing, you probably do not want this tablet. I however, already have a Galaxy Note 2, and had a Nexus 7, so I do not really care about apps. The reason I purchased this was to ease up the use on my macbook pro, and save it for mixing and mastering I've been doing on it. The build on this is extremely good. The browser is by far the best I've ever seen on a tablet, including the much more expensive iPad. I would buy this if you just casually want to view the internet or youtube.

I thought it was a good idea\nbecause the blackberry Operating System is quite unique children cannot\naccess other people on the internet easily.\n\nThis video chat made my mother happy, and new techno lesson in her 80's.\nI am satisfied with my first purchase.\n\nMarch 2013, I sold my 16gb tablet on eBay and bought 64gb Playbook\nfrom Amazon instead.\nThe reason is to store my books converted into PDF.\nI now have over 120 PDF books, over 1500 photos, and many videos.\nI am planning to store 200 more books in this tablet.

And they recently released that the PlayBook will not be getting the OS10 update they had wished for.  I am currently running OS2 update, and it works great.  I just hope BlackBerry continues to support the PlayBook.  If not, it will eventually become a dead tablet.  Apps are limited, and seem to be getting less and less.

Was worried at first I might get a refurbished unit but no, it was New and flawless as stated ;)\n\nYou can expect to have a low battery level, so once you start it and go through all the setup it will tell you if you want to upgrade to the latest OS version, which I did, and thus have to wait for battery levvel reach over 20% for it to start the download and install, it was looooong but I didn't mind.\n\nIn regard to the start from zero (from off state) it takes 2 minutes to fully load (some have stated as long as 5 minutes!). The screen is fantastic, speakers are incredible.\n\nKey points to my purchase of this tablet where: 64GB!!! (have tons of music & video loaded and still have around 30GB, this tablet will come with a little less of 5Gb from factory), wanted to try out the Blackberry Bridge feature, its really good, all emails, SMS, BBM are handled with the Playbook without having to take my 9380 out of its holster. Dual HD Cams is a nice feature :)\n\nRegarding apps, well there will be no support of BB10 (latest software release is OS 2.1 from february 2013, hope we keep seeing more updates, but for now Im OK with it), you get a limited choice of Apps no doubt, and most \"likeable\" apps are paid... too bad, not much of choice for games (free ones, you do have many paid games out there which are very nice).\n\nFor the amount of money this costs, I think it is a very good deal! It will make a nice travel companion :)\n\nUPDATE: after a week of use Im pretty happy with it! All connections (wifi, Bluetooth, Bridge) work flawlessly and Ive managed to download quiet a few applications and games! you can find a lot of sites with games/apps available for the Playbook! (do not rely just on the App World). There is a program called DDPB which will let you \"sideload\" Android apps to the Playbook! So Im sure that if you get a Playbook that little program will be your best friend, very easy and straightforward to use."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "This is a very frustrating product to own. When it arrived, the battery was low and could not be charged. The problem being that battery charging is software (OS) controlled. (One of a kind for me, in 40 years of playing with and engineering electronic products.) If the battery is low, the tablet does not boot up; and it stays dead. because the battery will not charge. Blackberry Link (175 meg) had to be downloaded and installed to a pc, in order to re-install the software onto the tablet, via usb. Then, it worked OK. Since owning it for over a month, on 1 occasion, the tablet won't charge because software got scrambled after downloading some files from a pc via the tablet's  Samba file service over wi-fi. The tablet software had to be reloaded again and re-initialized to factory condition, thus wiping out all datafiles in the device. It does not have an external memory card slot for backing up the device or user data. The Blackberry Desktop software on a pc, is meant for that. I was unable to download it from the support site.\nHowever, when everything is working, the Playbook tablet works well. The screen is nice and bright. The touch screen is responsive, and the multi-tasking works without problem, with 3 or 4 tasks running. The browser is very good, thought page loading is on the slow side, comparing to say Opera on Android. The browser supports Flash and loads pages like a desktop browser. The FileManager has limited Functionality, but workable. The DocToGo handles most Word or Excel files OK. The touch control works fine, after a bit of getting use to. One swipes up  from the bottom bezel  to open the main (home) page. When in a program (app), swipe down from the top bezel to open a context sensitive toolbar. Swipe from the bottom left corner of the bezel to the center of the screen, to bring up the keyboard. Killing a running app is as easy as swiping up to get to the home page, the app will shrink to a smaller window; then hit the \"X\" mark to kill the app. When a running app has been shrunk to a smaller window, one can bring another task into the foreground, by tapping on the app's shrunken window, in the Home screen view. (True multi-tasking under QNX).\nI do not have the confidence to use this tablet for any serious work because if the battery is low, it is as good as dead, till resurrected by software reload from scratch. This task takes half an evening, if one has to re-install Link on the pc first. AFter re-initializing the device, it wants to download the lastest OS from Blackberry, before it will start-up properly again. When powering up on a cold boot, it takes a long time to boot up (seems like 5 minutes). All in all, it is a terrific tablet if all the software bugs are worked out.\n\n(updated Oct 6, 2013\n\nAfter the third time when my device froze up randomly, I decided that it was most likely that it has a hardware fault somewhere, ram or flash memory problem. I contacted Blackbe3rry Support and returned the unit for repair. After receiving a new unit, I have not had any trouble with the Playbook.\n\nSince the browser is very comparable to Firefox in capability, most websites can be used in 'desktop mode'. I use the Playbook with a tiny bluetooth keybaord, for travel, in place of my ssd equipped netbook. Everything works as I expect, for the functions that I use (bluetooth with external keyboard, wi-fi, download from pc over wi-fi, browser, doc-to-go, gps location function, pdf reader, display pictures, and even editing a text file inside dosbox. The multi-tasking works without any problems, with the browser, dosbox, and doc-to-go running concurrently.) Task switching, control and stablity while running multiple tasks or apps, is smooth and in my opinion better than Andoird, Nook, and Windows 8 (no experience with iOS).\n\nSince receiving the new unit, I have not experienced a single system crash, lock up nor charging problem.\n\nThe Support service was very, very good. I was unable to convince the tech to send me a diagnostics to check the hardware. But, after spending 15 minutes with the support tech to convince him that my assessment of a hardware fault was real, I got an RMA, though I spent almost 20  more minutes on the phone, while the tech was getting permission for and preparing the rma. The next day, FEDEX delivered a return kit, with shipping box and the charge number for the return freight. The unit was dropped off at FEDEX on Tuesday, and on the following Friday, I got a working unit back, all with the compliments of Blackberry."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Overall, I would not recommend this product.  I recently purchased it because, at the price, it seems like a great deal.  You get 64GB of storage (a similarly priced Android tablet would have 8 or 16GB), and the hardware platform is similar to other 7\" Android tablets.  I was aware that the app store would have far fewer options available than what one would find in Google Play or Apple's store, but to be fair, there were quite a few options for games and other tools.  The unfortunate thing is that the unit arrived partially charged and would not allow me to recharge the battery with either the provided power adapter or the USB cable.  After doing some quick searching on Google, I found that a number of people experienced this problem -- either after first opening the product or after using it for a year.  Another negative is that the tablet has a very long boot up process.  I actually thought on initial boot that it was simply stuck on the initial BlackBerry screen given how long it took, but it eventually started.  I then assumed that this was probably just a delay due to it being the very first startup, but on a restart I found that it was the same thing.\n\nSo, overall, I would urge caution in purchasing the tablet.\n\nOn the positive side, it's got good hardware, great storage capacity, and some obvious software advantages for BlackBerry users.  Additionally, while it may not have the selection of apps and games that you may find for iOS or Android, it's not as if the store was completely empty with choices either.\n\nOn the negative side, however, I find it hard to \"trust\" the device as it seems the ability to recharge is a common problem.  Additionally (and others have mentioned), BlackBerry is obviously abandoning their tablet line, so the long-term prospects for the device aren't great -- but if you can get one that works (and recharges), I'm sure it's fine for many uses."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Hardware-wise, this tablet is similar to other 7-inch tablets in the market; it's light and portable and I kind of like its heaviness because it feels more sturdy and durable. The problem with this device is the Blackberry OS software. Multitasking on this device is simple and productive; it seems snappier then my iPad mini and I really enjoy using the swiping gestures on the playbook. What's missing, however, is a good selection of apps supporting the device (no Netflix...) and the lack of updates. It seems that Blackberry has given up on the tablet market (the CEO has recently announced that the playbook will not receive any significant updates). If you don't mind a cheap tablet with a large amount of storage to do the basic web-browsing then even so this device is not for you. At a similar price you could purchase a refurbished Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 2 which was recently updated to the latest Android software (via Cyanogenmod). Ultimately, Blackberry was too late in conforming to the modern market with their recent technology and they will constantly be out-paced."}

It is really hard to imagine BB pumped out such a terd. Do not waste your time with a BB playbook device, just don't. Slow, sluggish, battery hogs with no apps, no parental controls and microsoft nor apple have inter operable programs.

Blackberry has\ntaken care of earlier concerns with an update allowing greater selection of apps, and other important\nfeatures as well.

This surfs the net very quickly and has programs and apps available to pretty much\ntake care of anything formally handled by my laptop.  And, oh, it is 17 pounds lighter.\n  Both the video and movie player work flawlessly and this unit shines when showing HD films.\nMy average cost for the two was $159, and I would have to consider this a super deal for what these\ntablets are capable of doing.\n  OK, it is not exactly perfect, but very, very, close.  It does take almost 4 minutes to boot up\nbecause, unlike laptops, it loads ALL drivers before starting up.  I overcome this by simply leaving\nmine in sleep mode, where it can still start right back up after two days of being ignored.\n  I also purchased bluetooth keyboard and mouse for each, and it just makes the experience that much\nsweeter.\n  Try it and I am sure you will share my opinion."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I bought my Playbook almost a year ago, and I am very happy with it.  I didn't really know what to expect from it, but I had confidence in it based on its specification and other users' reviews of it.  I bought the 32GB Playbook based on comments from those who bought the 16GB tablet, but now wish that I had bought the 64GB tablet, for a little extra money.  I may still get it in order to have the larger storage capacity.\n\nI haven't yet learned all of its capabilities or used all of its features, but I bought the \"Blackberry Playbook for Dummies\" so that I could learn.  I haven't gotten too far into the book yet, but I will.  So far I have used it for web surfing, for reading news and email, listening to radio programs and for watching movies and videos, and it has been wonderful for those.  I did get hooked on Fruit Slash and spent too much time with that!  I downloaded the Blackberry Desktop software and love having the ability to pass files back and forth between my Windows 7 computer and the Playbook.  My computer just sees the Playbook as an external storage device - through my computer and the included USB cable I can manipulate files that are on the Playbook, move them between machines, change filenames, play MP3 and MP4 files, and edit documents.  I am amazed.  It's important to remember that the Playbook is more than an e-reader and more than a tablet to play games on.  It is a full computer with all of the power of a computer.\n\nThe one problem that I have is that three videos, which I edited and which run on my PC, don't run smoothly on the Playbook.  They begin well but then hesitate and sputter part-way through.  Now, those are three videos out of dozens, so it is not a serious problem, but it is still puzzling.\n\nThe Playbook is a nice size to carry around the city or take on trips, and I often carry it around my apartment so that I can listen to music or watch a documentary or video.  I am sure that once I get through the \"Dummies\" book and learn of its capabilities I will find many more uses for it.  It is a solid, well-made and generally well-functioning tablet and I strongly recommend it.\n\nI bought Blackberry's leather cover with the optional keyboard, which might not have been necessary but is convenient.  It's nice to have a fully functional keyboard complete with arrow keys to move around text and make edits.  I also bought the Rapid Travel Charger, which does speed up charging.  I recommend that, too."}

I have so far been through two going on three and I am still looking for one that will work longer than six hours.  So, if I find the third one functional for longer than six hours, I might change my rating.  However on the other hand the third one will be my last.  After that I will request a refund and never buy one ever again.  My rating will also drop off the scale.\n\nOkay, Now that I have a Playbook that is fully functional I am rejoining the Blackberry Fan Group again.  Awesome machine and it performs very well.  Every once in a while it has a minor glitch, but no more so than MS Windows.  Overall I give it 9 out of 10 stars taking back one because you have no ability to use an external memory card of any type."}

Probably my biggest problem that I have with this tablet is that it has very few apps, and quite frankly, most of them suck. it's hard to find a good app and that really sucks. some of the apps that I have trouble with are: YOUTUBE, why? because you cannot see full comments, you can't post comments; when you want to back up the video just a little, it starts it from the very beginning, which is very annoying. FACEBOOK, why? it app is ok, the problem that I have with it is that it won't show the images of your friends so it's really hard to find a friend. ok and for the apps that are not available.

Seriously, it's a phenomenal deal ($$) for a 64Gb tablet.\n\nPower management:  Not sure how long it'll run on a full charge....I usually run mine connected to the mains.  BUT: Overnight, I put it on STANDBY / not connected to the mains. At morning wakeup, it's @ 100% charge = no overnight power drain = excellent. Translation; no need to turn it off overnight or while in transit.\n\n  I've loaded > 3900 tunes on it, so it works as a stand-alone portable music server.  After trying the native/built-in music player, I went to the companion-Blackberry App Store, and found what, 60+ music/audio apps. (What's with the griping about not enuf apps!) I bought Neutron - also da Berries; it's feature-laden with a deep set of tweaks that allow for impressive levels of customization, once you've scratched its surface.  EG: I can shuffle ALL music, or just by ARTIST, ALBUM, GENRE or PLAYLIST, and let the tunes roll on; it's 'clock' displays both the running time of the track + time til the end of track; finding music content via Neutron - Scrolling through the music-source list is intuitive and FAST.  Bottom line, Neutron exceeds ALL of my expectations for a full-feature music player.\n\nAbout it's camera abilities: I'm on vacation, hiking and such, so I slid the PB into my ruck sack for quickie pictures.  Its 5Mp back-plane camera makes quick work of taking hi-quality on the fly snapshots and short videos with audio. Friends viewing pics on the PB usually commment on how sharp the pictures are = it's got a hi-resolution display.\n\nOther abilities: It's late winter / TAX TIME: The native calculator is a delight to use, even when working on the tax returns, a task most of us dislike. This native calc is the perfect example of how a BB product is 'Professional Grade'.\n\nSeriously consider buying one/both of the BB-built power supplies that connect to the PlayBook via 'magnetic attraction'.  That should mitigate the likelihood of fracturing/disabling the PlayBook's micro-USB jack. Folks, be real about these tiny jacks.  Since they are small, they are fragile.  ANY brand of product that uses them will have similar problems if the user is careless.\n\nBTW, I did feel the need to contact BB tech support; their reply was quick and the resolution was painless.  BRAVO, BB TECH SUPPORT!\n\nSooo, what are you waiting for!  I got a 2nd PlayBook for my wife to use as an E-Reader. When reviewed as such, it outscores several Sony products, and matches 4 stars that several B&N, Amazon and Apple products earn when reviewed as an E-Reader.

I purchased a playbook cover with a keyboard to fit this tablet which is better when using it like a laptop. Great playbook!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "We have 5 Playbooks in our family and are happy with them.  Our needs are fairly basic - mostly e-mail, web browsing, e-books (Kobo + PDF's) and playing music and videos.  The Playbook works very well for all of this, with good speed and quality.  It is especially good for playing anything on YouTube - we are very pleased with this.  The sound and video quality and the speed and functionality of the e-mail and browsing are good enough that we all expect to keep our Playbooks for some time yet, sometimes alongside other tablet devices.  It would have been nice to have had Blackberry 10 ported to the Playbook, but I had always been skeptical about how well this might work, as Blackberry 10 needs more memory and a faster processor, and the performance of BB 10 on the Playbook would likely have been marginal and sluggish.\n\nIf your needs are fairly basic, as ours are, then the Playbook could still serve well as your primary tablet device - otherwise, it could be very useful as a second device, especially for music and videos.  For YouTube, in particular, it is simply excellent.  If you can get a Playbook at a discounted price, it may well be worth it.  For our part, we may well get 1 or 2 more (if the price is right) as backups for the ones that we already have."}

After several statements from the CEO about people working on BB10 for PB they have finally announced that you will not be getting it. I sure hope all of these 5 star reviews will be revised to reflect the new development. You have just wasted $ on a dead platform! Do yourself a favor and spend $200 on a Nexus 7 from Google. It is better in every possible way (both hardware and software). You can also buy Samsung galaxy tab 2 for about the same price. Also let's not forget the awful app selection (the one you guys have been waiting for years to improve).\n\nBB fans can you please move on with your lives and let this company die? They have suffered long enough! You have a choice Apple or Android. Hell even Win 8 is better than Playbook OS.\n\nPS The CEO just described the company as a 'vibrant leader'. Maybe in the race of going down the toilet where it belongs."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Today, blackberry has stated that they will not bring the new improved OS- BB10 over to the playbook. This is crushing news as it spells the end for all playbooks. They are now OFFICIALLY bricks.\nBut here is a tip-  you can still use it as an internet radio because the speakers are great.\n\n***UPDATE***\nHey! BBRY fanboys and fangirls, GET OFF MY BACK !  Chances are, you are not here to buy the playbook and you probably own stock in the company or are from the land to the north of US.\nI have written an honest review here and if you don't like it then take it up with the CEO.\nAmazon review readers need to know the good and the BAD about this playbook.\n\nTo the people out there who are reading amazon reviews in order to determine if you should buy this item or not, i will expand on my review today.\n\nPros:\n 1- Good build quality. I have studied industrial design and I feel that this tablet is well constructed and with a nice design. (Then again, so is the ipad)\n 2- Great display\n 3- Excellent twin speaker system\n 4- Comes with a good weather app which is visually pleasing and has a very informative \"hour by hour\" feature.\n\nCons:\n 1-  The operating system is not nearly as good as Apple's or Android\"s.\n 2-  blackberry has stated that they will not be updating the software to the better BB10.\n 3-  When turned completely OFF, it takes approx. 2 minutes to start up.\n 4- Battery drains quickly when in SLEEP mode. Probably because the processor is always monitoring the screen for a swipe- up from the bottom, which wakes it up.\n 5- The calendar icon on the home screen always shows \"31\" which is an example of a simple thing which could have been easily made better. On the ipad, the calendar app shows the correct date. I mean this should be ELEMENTARY.\n 6- Very few apps. I will list the TWO which I downloaded: TripAdvisor- Hawaii  and Kayak. That's it. There were no other popular apps which most people have grown to love over the years. Now, the BBfans will tell you that apps can be \"side-loaded\" onto the device from the android store but I have been on the forums and researched this subject intensely and there are just too many users who have had bad experiences doing that.\n\nIn closing, I state again,  that I use this tablet as an internet radio due to it's great sounding speakers.  And that is the ONLY use I have for this item.\nThank you.\n\n--Btw, you can find these really cheap on the auction sites now.  Deep, Deep, deeply-discounted from the original retail price.\n\nPs: if you feel that I have helped in your decision to buy or not to buy , then please show your support because the fans are voting my review - \"not helpful\" ,even though they are not here to buy the playbook."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I guess the tablet itself is not guilty of anything wrong, instead Blackberry is guilty for letting us (innocent consumers who naively bet on this artifact) down. I shall confess i thought i was kind of closing a big deal when i get this playbook for an unbeatable price in the market, but it turned to be just a bait. Where should I start? first, lack of applications. Lack of interesting applications, of course, playbook hosts plenty of insignificant, nonsense and useless applications, but not the interesting ones. No Skype. Not a single decent PDF reader. It has a powerful camera, but of no use without convenient applications. It's simply the same as nothing, i hold nothing in my hand. It is well built, yes, it got this classy feeling you perceive when holding something solid and well constructed. But lacks features so simple and common sense as, for example, a \"hold\" button to prevent the device from starting when cleaning the screen's surface. Result: annoying cleaning session. The charger lasted less than a month, i had to purchase another. The device now doesn't keep the WIFI settings when restarted, i have to insert EVERYTIME i restart it, the WIFI settings again. Wasn't like that at the beginning, but seems that aging has done bad to it. Visited hundreds of forums searching for answers, but nothing could solve the problem. Browser was great at the beginning, now is simply obsolete. No updates, and the worst thing of all, no hope. No hope for anything, for any improve, for any change.\n\nSimply unacceptable. Blackberry should stand trial for this."}

The downsides are the deal breakers. There are very few useful apps in Blackberry World. It does not sync seamlessly with my PC and therefore books, movies and music don't transfer properly. This is the first of two I've ordered; the second one I had to return because it wouldn't connect to the PC at all. Now, this one won't charge because the input has somehow bent. I was quoted $100 to replace the mini USB port which is almost what I paid for the PB. And, lastly, the worst part of all: the PB discharges the battery in the standby mode, and if turned off it takes about 2 1/2 minutes to reboot. I've tried app killers, shutting off the notifications, closing all web activity to no avail. In the morning, the battery meter shows 3/4 of the charge was used up. I am getting a charging cradle for it to see if it will charge that way plus it'll make a great desk clock. Too bad because this could have been a great gadget.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "It's really too bad that the Playbook isn't a great tablet, because it looks and feels and (from a hardware perspective) seems to perform like one. But, well, there are so many buts.\nThe app offerings are pathetic, and the workarounds they offer on most android apps is Byzantine. but that's kind of how things go with the playbook. Everything is hard.\nSeeing as the entire point of a tablet is simplicity, I found this aspect really odd.\nAn example: You can download your photos quite easily from another computer, which is nice to cart around old pics you like to have around. But while with an ipad or galaxy, then viewing them, and moving between them, is ease itself, with the playbook, it's a struggle. There might be an app that makes this work, but I've been through four and nothing is satisfactory. I never for a minute considered that this might be a problem. It isn't with anything else I own. after all.\nAnd there are the truly bizarre, no Skype, no Netflix, both you'd think would be included in any product today.\nThe technical support is poor. And on...\nWhen it does what I expected it to do, it does it well. But right now, it's a reader and email machine with a USB stick functionality. That's actually okay for me, I have other stuff that does other things. But I only have a playbook because i got one for my son and it was completely inadequate for him. He now has a Galaxy and is quite happy. The playbook is very disappointing."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Okay, I can at least say that I prefer it vastly over the Kindle Fire HD & that I specifically chose this tablet not for it's steep price drop but because it was the only tablet last December with Flash support. I got it so I could play casual games & watch videos while traveling.\n\nNative browser: The bad thing is that it crashes frequently, doesn;t play too nicely with yahoo mail, is very slow, & does not support AbBlocker. It's the ads that cause the bulk of crashing & the slowness. The good thing is that when it crashes, reopening it will put you on the last thing you were looking at. There are several other 3ed party browsers you can install.\n\nProxybrowser: The only browser AdBlocker works on, because it comes with it. The downside is that won't play videos. Still, the lack of ads improve browsing speed & stability greatly.\n\nFacebook: Don't even try to play Facebook games on this thing; it will crash every time. It can't handle the workload.\n\nYoutube/Blip: Half of the time, when an ad plays in the middle of the video, it will play the ads over & over, then reset the video to the beginning or end it.\n\nBattery life: 4 hours tops, unless you turn off WiFi when you're not using it.\n\nFree games: You'll have to spend a few books to find anything good. Most of the free games are duplicates, aimed at detracting drooling 2 year olds, or the most mediocre games in their native Chinese, Spanish, & Russian languages.\n\nCamera: Fill a fish bowl full of cocoa; that's what your pictures will look like. Not unlike that weird orangeness old cellphone cameras have.\n\nJava support: None; there goes your plans to sideload Minecraft.\n\nSoftware updates: Haven't been any since I bought it, so Flash is several versions behind.\n\nBlackberry Desktop Software: I've never gotten this thing to successfully connect to my desktop. Even their tech support gave up trying to help me.\n\nPrimary uses: It still does the little things I wanted it for; Play solitaire in bed as a pre-sleep ritual, access Yelp/email/Google Maps on vacation, has a screen 3x the size of an iPad, & isn't an Apple or Microsoft product. I also like to think that if someone tried to steal it from me, they'd notice it was a Playbook & would give it right back. Heheh."}

I have been thinking about a tablet for some time for when I take a short trip and I don't want to carry a laptop. The Samsung smart phone is nice but a pain to type on. Plus I wanted something that I could do some work on while traveling but not break the bank. The computer geek I was sitting on the plane with pulled out a Nexus tablet and I asked him how he liked it. He said he wished he had waited a little because he would have bought the playbook which is now selling for under $200. It had better memory, screen, and sound. So I took his advice and bought the playbook. The setting up of my email, contacts and calendar from outlook was easy. I love the documents to go function. Now I can load on some excel spreadsheets, powerpoint presentations and some word documents that I need while traveling. This really made it very usable for more than just a movie viewer. The only disappointments that I have is that gotoassist does not have an app that will work on this so I can connect co-workers computers to solve problems and that there is not an SD card slot. But for under $200 bucks with 64 gig you cant really go wrong. It is solidly built, the screen is gorgeous, and the sound is really good with the external speakers."}

I was a little worried that the 7-inch size would be too small but I actual find that the size is perfect. I can toss it in my bag wherever I go, I can hold it with one hand, and it is large enough to easily read documents.  The interface is intuitive and for 64 gigs of storage the current price is great. The screen keyboard and next word fill work really well. The Playbook has or you can add many apps including documents-to-go (for viewing and editing word, excel, and powerpoint), calculator, twitter, wordpress, facebook, photo editing, telnet, weather, and games.  The Blackberry App market is not very user friendly and the selection and quality of the available apps is lower than the android market.  Basics apps such as kindle reader, skype, and netflix are not available for Playbook, although Blackberry has some of its own versions of similar software and there is supposed to be a way to side load free android apps (like Skype) via your PC. If you need a specific app, check BlackBerry World before purchasing to make sure it is available for the Playbook.  The Playbook I bought has wifi but no direct connection which is fine for me as I have a portable hotspot and did not want another monthly bill. One function that I wish it had was the ability to print directly. I do not have a Blackberry phone so I cannot comment on how well it connects.

That somewhat makes up for the lack of apps on this thing. The app world (in lack of a better word), sucks. All good apps cost money and the free apps are not professional. I love the OS on this thing. It runs very smooth, the browser gives you the full desktop experience, the best part about it is that it supports flash player. So that means while on Facebook, and your friend posts a video, it plays right there. Unlike iPad which runs a QuickTime player and pulls up a whole other app. I also like how you can run several apps at a time. This thing is pure gestures, to unlock, you slide up from the bottom, to pull up a keyboard. Slide up from the bottom right corner (in case you're wondering, the keyboard automatically comes up when you tap on something to type something), and to switch apps while in an app slide from left to right or right to left. While in a browser, you can download pictures, music, and videos just by holding the download link or holding the pic. You press save link and it comes up a save file as and you type what you want it to be saved as. All in all I love my playbook, if you are a person who loves apps, this is not the tablet for you. If you are a person who loves just the whole tablet experience, this is the tablet for you. The fact that it has 64 gb of space is absolutely amazing."}

Everywhere I went I ran into a dead end.\n\nI contacted Blackberry and inquired when a Skype app might be available.  They only told me working on it but no date in sight.  When I checked the internet I found blogs where people were asking for the Skype application over a year ago.\n\nI use Skype when I travel out of the country, so that long distance calls don't bankrupt me.  If I kept the Blackberry Playbook I would have to lug along my laptop too.  That defeats one of the reasons I want a tablet.\n\nSo if you don't need Skype, I give the Blackberry a solid 4 Stars.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "A GREAT Tablet for your Dolla'...! I have been playing around with this thing for the past week or two, and this tablet is nice! It is a solid built tablet, with a nice \"rubberized/coated\" backing to keep it from slipping out of your hand. The weight is there, knowing you have something in your hand which I like, due in part by it being a LCD tablet, and not a LED tablet like iPADs and such.\n\nLike the iPADs out there, it does not have the MicroSD/SD slot for expanding memory and such. However, getting 64GB of memory compared to an iPAD Mini w/ 16GB of memory, for HALF the price! For me.... that's a \"no brainer\".\n\nAlso, it comes w/ at least 1GB of RAM & a 1.2GHz processor, and I believe.... iPAD Mini is 512MB of RAM? REALLY... I hate to say this, but it's time for the \"Fruity Named\" I.T. company to upgrade their hardware. They are way behind in that area, yet... charge the most money for their products.\n\nAnyway, the O/S is very smooth & simple to figure out. Took me 10 minutes to get the jist of how it works, and have now gotten quite competent rolling through it for all the uses I need for it. I have let this thing stay on, with the WiFi on until it drains to zero, with periodic use - this BB Playbook EASILY lasted 24 hrs before I went and charged it back up. (NOTE - if you use the cellular on it, music, video, it will be less) I play a LOT of music thru the WiFi, and it lasted a good 8 to 10 hrs.\n\nOther little nuances to note:\n1)the fact you can \"Pause\" applications in the background OR have ALL of them active. I pause them, so this is probably why the battery will last longer than maybe for other people.\n2) there's desktop software to download (free), so you can transfer files between computer & Playbook, and this is very handy!\n3) Having HDMI is nice when wanting to surf/watch a vid on my big screen TV instead.\n4) Touch KYBD on the Playbook is nice to type on for a 7 incher. Adjusting the sensitivity of the touch screen KYBD is simple.\n5) Quite impressive sound quality on the dual speakers AND when listen thru the headphones AND listening it thru my AUX jack in my car stereo.\n6) The BB Playbook takes surprisingly decent pictures & video. (5MP rear / 3MP front)\n\nSo if you're looking for an easy, simple, more money for your buck tablet - Get the BB Playbook. I use it for music, writing lyrics, reading documents, and general surfing of the web for the most part. I don't need a full blown laptop for on the go, nor paying the high price of other tablets out there. However, I wanted the closest thing to \"professional grade\" (NOT Consumer grade) I could get, w/o the huge 'professional price', and this tablet just makes things bit more convenient for me."}

Let me tell you, I was very hesitant to buy the playbook thinking I was getting an old tablet with a old OS system, reading all the negative bias reviews form the android and apple followers including all the noise about the Apps, which by the way I have not needed one yet .  But what a surprise the OS is the best I've seen. Blackberry includes 90 days of support and I called them 2 times and the customer service is the best!  If you want a practical tablet that works and you are just a simple Joe like me I strongly recommend this product."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "This was a screamin deal. 64G , great screen, nice weight, feels good, looks good. Yeah there aren't as many apps, but you can go to apps.goodereader.com/playbook and get a ton of android apps to load thru a desktop interface on a windows computer.\nWhich I'm doing. A 64G ipad mini would cost almost 400 dollars more. It you just want something to turn on and use easily go ahead and get your ipad. If you don't mind digging a bit and having some fun and saving a bunch of money in the process, get a playbook. Get a playbook just to make sure their is an option to the android/apple rivalry. I'm glad I bought this.\n\nJune 17 2013 - have to update. I like the playbook but I'm tired of blackberry not making os 10 available to the play book. The app store is bad enough without saddling us with an old OS. Many of the apps on this tablet suck. Facebook sucks. It's slow and non-responsive. All apps that I have on my iphone work better on the iphone than on this playbook. If you get a playbook - use it as a small pc. use the browser, email, docs, etc. but don't expect apps to work well. so far, they don't, even when they exist . Which they often don't."}

I've had no issues with it thus far: it plays video/music beautifully, and it's a nice size to carry around as an e-reader. My only gripe, like so many others, is that there are only a limited number of apps available; but hopefully, that will change in the near future.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Where to start, where to start... on a device I've come to utterly despise... how about a stream of consciousness because I can't be bothered to write a good review? No? Too bad.\n\nOS is rubbish. 3 min to boot, no app support, and almost no customization or technical options. Yay, it multitasks well and can handle multiple apps at once! I dare you to find 5 good apps to multitask. The lack of detailed OS or hardware settings is quite maddening and a trend I righteously reject. Apple chum might appreciate having their hands held, but I demand access to my own devices. That's another thing: Don't you DARE try to force me to sign up to your website and management servers merely to access my own device. There's also no legitimate reason for this device to maintain a constant connection to the RIM master servers. This is totally unacceptable! Never, ever, in a thousand years no!\n\nIncompetence creates comedy: In all those millions of hours of testing did it not occur to you ONCE that you were shipping a product that requires a RIM/BB login to fully function, EVEN TO RUN FIRST SETUP, but to be able to login to your RIM account on that first setup YOU NEED WIFI? You can create a temporary or local account, but you can't go online with it until you validate it with RIM master servers, so you are locked out of most of the functionality of your device. There is a wifi setup option during firstrun, but its simple and takes no detailed or complex Wifi setups into account (such as MAC Address exclusion, and there's no way to find the MAC without logging in.) On all of these setups (mine included) THE PLAYBOOK IS A BRICK WITH VERY LITTLE FUNCTIONALITY. The arrogance of RIM/BB to expect people to change their networks based on the Playbook's engineering deficiencies is just... staggering. And this crippling flaw hasn't been patched to date! But I digress...\n\nTouchscreen is not accurate, especially when browsing web or doing anything requiring precision. I stopped using it to browse the web after a few days. It was simply frustrating beyond description. The touchscreen also seems to have a lot of ghost presses, especially when the orientation is not standard. This started after the first month and has gotten progressively worse.\n\nScreen is good for video, but many formats aren't supported (lack of mkv, ac3, etc, really unforgivable). If a video plays, it usually plays well, and you'd better hope it does because there aren't very many options to fix it (you can't even correct the aspect ratio, which is beyond bizarre). Youtube looks great when you manage to get something loaded with the lousy touchscreen. The 2 cameras have the worst picture quality I've ever seen (even worse than a Motorola A855).\n\nApps run fast... but there are barely any worth having. Store is cluttered with crapware, spam, and useless apps. Hilariously bad appstore. You have to see it to believe it.\n\nWeb browsing is extremely tedious... get used to seeing checkerboards and the aforementioned misclicks/ghostclicks.\n\nCan't be rooted past a certain version, can't backtrack to old OS versions, and even when rooted is essentially worthless because nobody cares enough about this device to make anything interesting for it, rooted or no. Sideloading Android apps is a gigantic headache I researched but did not bother to tackle. Didn't seem worth it with so many other glaring problems.\n\nAt least it's very cheap... because it was a total failure that originally retailed at over 3 times as much. I'd compare the Playbook to a previous epic tech disaster like the Newton, Tablet PC, or something similar, but I really think it deserves its own place, because in the future the Playbook will be looked at as a case study in \"How to do everything wrong.\"\n\nNo matter what your interest level in tablets there's no reason to own a playbook. None. Even if you're married to RIM -- get a divorce! That train is heading for a cliff and you don't want to be on board when it flies off. I replaced this with a Nexus 7 and the difference is night and day."}

Youtube streams without a hinge, especially with the free Youtube app. I've read alot of reviews where Blackberry Playbook owners weren't satisfied with the amount of apps on the native Blackberry app store & potentially gave this tablet a bad rating, which is ludicrous in my opinion.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Just purchased this 64g model for $200, thinking it was great deal.  I was looking for a small Wi-Fi tablet, something cheap to use mostly for streaming music, facebook, twitter, youtube, pandora, hulu, netflix, e-reader, news & sports and e-mail, etc.  (I have an iPad already and a small Samsung Android Galaxy S5 media player.  Here's the problem with this playbook ... the Blackberry Playbook App Store is terrible, very... very... very... LIMITED SELECTION of apps. available for this unit.  Here's the details of my issues, if anyone has a fix / solution or recommendation, please advise.\n\nThe Facebook playbook app is way-outdated and doesn't work right. No Pandora, iHeart Radio, Songza, Spotify, iTunes playbook apps available.  No Hulu, Netflix, Ebay or Amazon playbook apps available.  No Google apps available, Maps, Gmail, etc.  No e-reader apps that are any good.  In addition ... GPS location services and Bluetooth are not working correctly.  And the touch screen is not always responsive.\n\nSo what is good and what apps are working?  So far ... YouTube, Twitter and Slacker Radio and the apps from Blackberry for their Music Store and Video Store, plus the Accuweather app ... all appear to working as they should.  The build quality is good, LCD screen is bright, front facing stereo speakers are really nice, camera works great, e-mail and BB messaging work good (after you set up accounts of course).  The browser works OK, a little slow ... but viewing websites on a small 7\" tablet without an app. ... is just stupid.  So...  Unless Blackberry decides to update their App Store for The Playbook ... don't waste your money.  Buy an Apple iPad Mini or a Samsung Galaxy Tab or a Google Nexus or A Kindle, Nook or a great E Reader - anything other than this Playbook.  What good is a proprietary OS without the apps to go with ... what was I thinking.  Disappointed and sending back."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "This is a good tablet. I have no regrets in purchasing it. We do need BlackBerry to send the BB10 update. The current operating system is quite deficient in available apps."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I had high hopes when I chose a Playbook after considering a number of tablet options. Physically, the device is exceptional. These tablets were intended to retail for ~$700, and they look the part. The quality is outstanding, almost like a piece of military hardware. It's heavy and solid, and feels like a serious piece of equipment. The touch screen is exceptionally responsive, it's too bad the operating system isn't the same way. I observed noticeable lags and stalls while navigating the system. Aside from the paucity of quality apps in Blackberry World, the highly-touted browser was also a disappointment, at times behaving very sluggishly, with delays of several seconds waiting for responses to taps. I'm not sure what the issue is, but even on a fast wifi connection, it's just laggy. Page and image rendering, however, was very good. There is also what I consider to be misleading marketing surrounding this device, as well. A lot of things I read implied that the Playbook can run Android apps, either in a wrapper, or as a sideload. This is not the case. While there are some Android apps that have been ported to the Playbook OS, there is no easy way to simply install an Android app, nor is there any wrapper or emulator that is accessible on the Playbook itself. If you want to run an Android app, you have to get the actual .apk file, which may not be a simple task in some cases, generally requiring a rooted Android device to do so, and you have to use a web or PC-based utility to \"convert\" it to a Playbook format. Even then, there is no guarantee that it will work, or even be recognized as an app by the Playbook OS. Of course, this is far more effort than most users would be willing or able to make anyway. I was not able to get the one work-related app I needed to function, much to my disappointment. In short, if you're looking to run Android apps, get an Android tablet. I was attracted by the Playbook's security and level of quality, but it does not replace an Android tablet if you need the apps and Google Play. There are many basic apps that should have been ported that are conspicuously missing. Gmail, Kindle, Ymail, and many others just aren't there in the Blackberry World.\nIf you are a hardcore Blackberry user just looking for a larger format, i.e. tablet, this might be a good choice, given the heavy discounts. If you are a happy Android user, it will probably not meet your expectations, in spite of the quality of the device and polish of the OS itself. Supposedly, the new Blackberry OS 10 is coming to this device later this year, but it remains to be seen how much, if any functionality this will add."}

I spent 3 months trying to except that all devices have learning curves. If it wasn't for the fact that i got this just before my daughters wedding and it has videos on it that i now have no way to get off, i probably would have returned the piece of junk.  I have been a blackberry fan for years and thought i would be served well by the playbook---what a nightmare. Other than the beautiful high quality video, there is NO redeeming qualities to this product!  The last attempt to try and get past wanting to crush it into power was 7 (yes 7) hours on the phone with tech support... Not one shred of resolution. Please think twice before buying one of these, its not worth $2.  I can't sync to my computer - resolution, buy a different computer - perhaps.  Can't display about half the PDF files - yea, thats because of how they were generated. Can't hear audio file and see picture - playbook doesn't see many file extensions.

This was the best priced (new) one that I could find ($210 for a 64GB version). She spent the next 3 days putzing with the unit. Her goal was to link it with the Torch so that she could use the Torch's data stream on the Playbook. She got this working. Also, reviews indicated that the USB port has a nasty habit of snapping off. She got the alternative power cord & also a dock (both from Amazon). Finally, a Blackberry case (also from Amazon). She is using the WI-FI & Bluetooth for communication & plans on avoiding the USB port.\n---\nThe bottom line is that, if you have a Blackberry phone that can link to the Blackberry Playbook, then this might just be the right tablet for you. The only item of concern is the limited selection of apps in the RIM store. If it can run the apps that you need (or want) to use, then this is a good unit at a good price.\n---\n1 April -- Update: She was able to get the Kindle App loaded.

But overall I love it, take it with me everywhere, and when I use other tablets, or even my android phone, I find myself missing the swiping gesture features of the playbook."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I got the Playbook as a gift some months ago and the truth is that I like the product.  I know there are not that many apps on the market and the ones that exist they have a price, now I have other tablets.  I use the playbook for the following:\n\nSurf the web. You actually get the PC version of the website and not the \"mobile\" version of it.\nPlay movies with it.  Love the speakers.\nWatch amazon prime.  It does that straight from the website because it supports flash.\nAnswer emails and prepare work related stuff.\nPlug in the mini HDMI and watch the movie on my TV.\n\nI do not care about many apps but the apps I do wish they had was Netflix and Skype but it is not a deal breaker for me because I can use them on my phone, other tablets, PC, etc.  Also I know that you can port android apps and I have already done it for a few of them but I think it is just one step and if you are not technically savvy it can put people off.\n\nBottom line, I think it is a good tablet, I am hoping that it will only get better with the release of the new OS but it is good already, but if you do the cost analysis of acquiring one vs. any other electronic out there I think the playbook will come up on top just for the price point of it alone.  The only time the Playbook will lose it would be when it comes to apps.\n\nI hope that Blackberry (RIM) works and encourages developers to port the apps directly to the blackberry app center.  It shows that they have not forgotten this tablet because it keeps getting OS updates and if you look at reviews from when it came out and newer one you will see that RIM has not forgotten about it."}

I just ordered a styus pen that I am hoping will help me with this problem.

Yes, I know, Blackberry Playbooks have an Android player, but is it compatible with all Android apps? Me thinks not. The third thing I don't like about the Playbooks is the Micro-USB port is really hard to plug the cable into. It could just be mine... afterall, mine is a refurb unit... but in all other respects it is good as new.\n\nI do like the fact that I can get online with the Playbook, because I have a Blackberry Torch.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "After doing much research and having tried all the premiere tablets on the market, I landed on RIM's BlackBerry Playbook. I tried out the iPad 3 and I was not terribly impressed.  It felt very fragile in my hands, like it could break if I squeezed it too hard, the speakers truly suck as they sound tinny, and these are problems are significant given the money Apple charges.  I have a BB smartphone and I have always been impressed at how well-made their products are.  This made the playbook a no-brainer for me...I had no idea just how superior it is...the QNX processor is lightning fast and can easily manage several open windows.  You can edit word documents, spreadsheets, and it has flash player which iPad does NOT.  The screen and video camera is HD.  I opted for the 64gb model, as the price difference between the three sizes is negligible so it's worth it to upgrade to 64gb.  Though, with cloud storage, for most people, 16gb is probably plenty.  The touch keyboard is exceedingly comfortable and the most intuitive I have ever used...it really does learn how you write and anticipates your word choices.  It has a port for a micro hdmi cable so you can enjoy your downloaded content on your hdtv.  I bought this cable (sold separately)for only 4 bucks on amazon.  The PB is comfortable to hold as the build quality is immediately apparent.  It does not feel like it's going to fall apart if you drop it.  The processor is faster than any laptop I have ever used. The web browser is like flipping pages in a book.  If you have BB phone...it open up a flurry of additional features called BlackBerry Bridge.  The bluetooth connection syncs the two devices so you can manage appts, contacts, view, receive and reply to your text messages using your BB smartphone as a transmitter.  Your phone can be used as a remote control when watching a video or listening to music and you can browse the website for your phone's keyboard...it is a really amazing set of features...and best of all you can use your BB phone's data package to use 3/4g connectivity if you do not have access to to wife/hotspot so you do NOT need to sign up for a data service.\n\nIf it seems I am gushing over this product, it's because it's that good.  So those of you who may think BB products are out, this will remind you as to why BB has such loyal fans.  And finally, it is simply priced...nowhere else will you find a tablet of such superior quality, enormous storage, awesome features, great versatility (ideal for home and work) and just plain fun for the jaw-dropping low price as I purchased it for slightly over 200 bucks (reg 700). Do not waste your money on the iPad...RIM has outdone themselves with this tablet. Outstanding product.\n\nNote: just to recommend some accessories to maximize your enjoyment...make certain to get a case of some description...there are many which come with a bluetooth keyboard built in...I opted for the Otterbox Defender as I have 2 year old twins and this case can take a beating and perfectly preserve your tablet. It has a built-in screen protector and a tough outer protective layer.  Its an amazing case which provides a complete solution.  I also recommend a micro hdmi to reg. Hdmi cable and extra charger. Getaway good quality case for it as it will eliminate the need and cost of an extended warranty/service plan for it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I normally don't review items. But for this one I am. I purchased this for my daughter as she wanted an ipad mini. She wanted to get it with her birthday money. I told her she did not have enough. She got about $200.00 for her birthday. The only apple product we own is my daughter's iphone 16gb which I got her for Christmas. I checked her memory and she was down to about 600mb left. She deleted a bunch of apps now she has 3.4gb left. A 16gb ipad mini is about $400.00 so I did some research on 7 inch tablets and came upon this blackberry playbook. I checked reviews all over the Internet especially you tube. Try searching blackberry playbook vs I pad mini. Well besides an amazing hd display and far superior microphone and speakers and great reviews I went with this 64 gb playbook. My brother bought his son a 64 gb ipad mini for Christmas and paid $600.00 plus tax from best buy. What a sucker!! I paid $219.00 for this 64 gb playbook along with a screen protector and a leather case totaling $244.00 with free shipping with prime and received it the next day instead of 2 days. As far as apps and games there are plenty. Really how many apps do you really use anyway. My daughter is very happy with this tablet and so am I. I am writing this review on the blackberry tablet buy one you won't regret it. As far as apple products I think they are over rated and overpriced. If you want to pay 600 bucks for a 64gb ipad mini go ahead. As far as the playbook I think for the price it is a far superior tablet than the mini. Can the mini multitask? Not. I have had as many as 10 apps open at once and this tablet never lagged one bit. Trust me I am the type of person that does a lot of research before a purchase. Trust me you will not be disappointed. Buy one now!!"}

After reading several reviews and watching YouTube videos, I decided to give this a try since I was going through new gadget withdrawals. I must say, for people to give this tablet a bad name because of the \"lack of apps\" are idiots! Android apps can be downloaded to it. This is a GREAT, AMAZING tablet and it is worth every penny. I have a 7\" Samsung Galaxy Tab and an iPad 2. It's so much better than my Samsung and I'm still debating on whether it's better than my iPad, but i KNOW it's better than the iPad Mini. Just on flash alone, it's a great tablet. The HD screen is GORGEOUS and I love the gestures/UI. It's not too much. I also love how the buttons are on the top. They are small and you aren't able to press them (for function) easily when using the tablet. I find when using my Samsung tablet, I easily press the sleep/wake button when I'm just surfing the internet, so those buttons are a plus on the Playbook. The only downside to ME about using the Playbook is if you're using it for a long time, it can get a little heavy in your hands, so it's best to have it on a flat surface if your wrists get tired easily, but that's the only problem I have with it. It's built sturdy and the design is flawless. I would recommend this to EVERYONE. I'm sure once the BB10 hits the Playbook, it would be even better. Battery life is great, too."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I have now had my Blackberry Playbook 11 months.  It was very simple to set up and worked, after charging overnight, perfectly.  I needed to call support because I couldn't get it to accept my password.  After about half an hour of this and that, the nice young man at support said maybe I should take symbols out of the password.  (I had a very strong password with mixed capitals, numbers, and symbols.)  A slightly less complicated password solved the problem.  (This, by the way is not the same password you use to protect the Blackberry.  This is the one they use when you register and contact them.) I have never had a smartphone, so the \"Bridge\" aspect was irrelevant. Although my car has Bluetooth, I use it for my cell phone, as I wouldn't be using the Playbook while driving. Having had PC's for 30 years, I had a fairly steep learning curve to use this, but there is a useful \"Help\" section.\n\nThe screen is bright and clear.  When something it too small to see, one can widen it out with one's finger tips. The ap store is easy to use, but the reviews for aps are nearly useless.  I therefore have many aps that are bought and paid for that I have \"deleted\" but are held in a list where they can be reactivated at a moment's notice.  I would certainly like not to be charged if I delete within 24 hours - or even one hour.  A few aps (like one I tried for crosswords) won't enlarge with fingertips so are impossible to use.\n\nI have noticed the battery in the back heats up quite a lot while I am using it and it is not plugged in.  I wonder if that is just my Playbook or is common in them all?  It seems to me the battery should last more than a couple of hours of heavy use, but it doesn't.  Could that be related?\n\nOne can arrange the icons into logical folders so \"Games\" can be in one or \"Utilities\" or \"Reference\" in others.  This declutters the screen and makes things easier to find.\n\nThe camera works, but, compared to an ordinary small digital camera, it takes lousy pictures.  I haven't tried video/phone conversations on this. (or my PC for that matter.)\n\nThe Playbook fits nicely in my average sized purse, alongside my Kindle, if the Kindle isn't in a case.  (A Kindle - not the \"Fire\" - is easier for an avid reader to read.)  I bought the Playbook mainly for travel so mail and Facebook are important to me.  I am still working on how I might make FB safer when traveling.  I seem to be able to get it up, and even post, if I enter from the mail program.  The mail program has one problem other people won't have.  I have a lot of trouble deciphering little symbols instead of words. Being a cautious person, I am leery of doing a \"click & see.\"  PCs have a bubble with actual words that come up if one hovers over an icon.  I very much would like to see that on Playbook.\n\nA huge disappointment for me is that I haven't figured out how to get Bridge Baron on it.  The side loading instructions are quite daunting.  I was going to do it, and bought it from Amazon, but it didn't seem to want to download on to my PC where I could sit with instructions in my hand and the Blackberry and PC in front of me. So it is bought, but not loaded.\n\nNow for support - which some reviews have criticized.  Yesterday was the first time I needed it.  I went to turn the Playbook on, and nothing happened.  I plugged it in and still nothing.  Not even a light on the front.  I had used it that very afternoon, and the battery had been fine when I turned it off.\n\nI had a heckuva time finding Support.  The Blackberry web site seems to be fiendishly designed to keep a person from locating support.  I went through the FAQs, but the problem wasn't there.  There was no place to e-mail.  So my only hope was to call.  I had resigned myself to not getting it working again because it seemed very dead.  But last night I called support. A warning, before you start this process, write down the serial number in big letters because it is only readable on the box with a magnifying glass.  On the Blackberry itself, it is in tiny very, very dark gray on black print, completely invisible to the naked eye, to the right of the ports on the bottom.  If you have discarded the box, you will need a powerful magnifying glass with the brightest light in the house.  I used +4 magnifying glasses over my regular glasses and a halogen lit magnifier meant for fly tying.  You will need that serial number both on line and several times talking to support.\n\nThe polite young man I spoke to had a soft voice and spoke with an accent.  The poor guy had to repeat himself many times even after I switched to a phone with a volume control.  He talked me through trouble shooting, and we finally got to my reloading RIM from their site to my PC(note, not the Blackberry site.) He then had me unplug and replug the Playbook in to the PC.  LO! the Playbook came to life.\n\nNow, this took about an hour and a half, but part of that was a download that took about 10 minutes and gave us a break - bathroom? coffee?\n\nI have read complaints about the support.  My experience is that ALL support people for any electronics are hard to find.  I assume that is to keep frivolous questions away. If our problems are severe enough, we will keep at it.  However, the severity means that it takes a long time to fix, but, miraculously, these things are nearly always fixable after an hour or so of trying this and that.  (We called that \"hacking\" 30 years ago, before the definition narrowed.)  This is much better than mailing it back and doing without for a couple of weeks.\n\nThe bottom line is that I found support good.  Not easy, but good.  Also, there was no charge, despite what someone here stated.  But I found a spot on the web site that said something about $29.95 so a frustrated person could easily get confused wandering around on the Support pages.\n\nSo, am I happy?  Yes.  Would I buy it again?  Probably.  That would be a big \"yes,\" if I can get Bridge Baron from the ap store.  I do worry some about it heating up with a long bout of solitaire."}

It's being sold for cheap, and considering the build quality, specs, and features, it's really very competitive with the entry level Nexus 7s, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2s, and Kindle Fires.  Of course, of course, its app selection is dreadful.  I was encouraged by the announcement that BB10 is coming to PlayBooks, but I'm skeptical that it will.  Even so, I still have a Blackberry phone, and the Bridge functionality is pretty handy.  The browser is good.  The audio is very good.  32 gb is plenty of storage for me.  Email is good.  Wi Fi reception is good.  There are a couple of pretty cool little apps, and overall, as long as you get it for cheap (make sure you spend at least 25% less on one of these as you would on one of the aforementioned's entry level tabs), I think you're well advised to do so."}

Perfect for listening to music, the speakers are wonderful, and I love that I can upload music and content from itunes so easily. I'm a college student, so a great app the playbook has for me is the Docs to Go app. It's perfect for working on papers on the go! The email app fine. However I would like a real twitter app, the link/icon is pointless. The camera isn't great but it's okay if you must take a quick photo.\n  This is a great buy! Bring on bb10 for the playbook!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I chose the Playbook for a three month backpacking trip because it fit my budget, battery life, and weight needs. Based on those criteria, the Playbook was great - it's only 1 pound and I carried it with me everywhere with no problems, it lasted for several hours on one charge (even watching TV), and it was cheap compared to my other options. It did its job (emailing home and booking hostels) while I traveled, but if I did it again I'd pay more for a better tablet. I hated that I couldn't Skype on the Playbook. I hated that I couldn't connect via a microUSB for picture uploads. The app selection leaves a LOT to be desired, and promised Android Market access didn't happen. Apps crashed all the time, even when it was the only thing running. The camera quality is terrible. The tablet often had issues connecting to the internet, when my iPhone (which only went on the trip to contact family - wouldn't have taken if I could use Skype) had no problems. The touchscreen is laggy and often froze, and the user interface was quite odd. It wouldn't download most email attachments, and forget about opening DropBox or creating simple documents."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "The BlackBerry Playbook is an incredible piece of hardware. It may not be Retina display but there is a preloaded HiDef video that looks stunning and everyone I have shown it off to thinks the same. It also has stereo speakers that certain other \"i\" products do not have. It also has the HDMI out. I believe hardware wise it is up to par with any Android tablet and clearly surpasses the iPad. The operating system is elegant and the multitasking is great. The latest iOS requires you to double-click to bring up tasks, then keep your finger until the icons wiggle and press the - red sign to close background apps. On the BlackBerry just swipe to reveal all apps and click the X. And you have the choice of not leaving them running on the background, you can just close them and they will stay closed. I believe the Playbook is superior in almost (more on that in a bit) every way to the iPad and comparable more to the Android competition.\n\nNow, having said that, the Playbook is not for everyone (at least hopefully until BB10 gets to the Playbook). I see it more as a work tool. It allows for Bluetooth communication with a Blackberry so that you don't really need a data plan SIM on it, just use your current data plan on your Blackberry phone. Although it requires you to have a tethering plan on your phone to allow full use of the data plan, it does allow you to browse through the Bluetooth connection with the Blackberry Bridge Browser. And if you already have your email accounts on your BIS or BES Blackberry, you can read, reply, forward, etc., any email through the Playbook. So you can relegate your Blackberry to your pocket and use the Playbook for everything you would normally use your Blackberry for. It also has Print to Go which basically allows you to print anything through the WiFi to your Playbook. So you want to avoid carrying your plane itinerary on paper, print it to your Playbook. It also has Documents to Go built in so you can view, edit and create Word and Excel compatible documents. You can also use it as a network storage location so you can have a Word checklist on your Playbook and have someone else or yourself access it through the WiFi network.\n\nNow, the downside. Playbook apps range from bad to few. There are only a couple games worth playing, unless you are willing to pay for them, and even so the selection is not great. This is the one point the iPad and Android tablets beat the Playbook and why it has not sold. The good side is you can find it very cheap online.\n\nI use it every day and I can certainly say it is a rugged, capable product. I do wish it had a better app selection, but it does everything I need it to do. And it is cheap. I have the 64GB model for less than what you would get a comparable Android tablet with far less memory, and of course way cheaper than an iPad. The 7 inch form factor is also very comfortable and easy to type in with both hands and I find myself thumbing like in my Blackberry with ease. I am tall and with big hands but doing that feat on a 10 inch iPad would not be possible. A more comparable unit might be the iPad mini but the Playbook still feels more rugged and overall a higher quality product.\n\nSo if you are looking for a cheap, capable tablet and use a Blackberry phone, the Playbook is a no-brainer. If you want to download free apps and want a huge selection of apps where everything you can think of already has more than 10 apps to choose from or want an expensive toy for the kids, then go for something else. I think RIM (now Blackberry) did not market this well and should have gone after corporate for this product. Now with BB10 we will see if the tablet can actually do both things. It certainly has the horsepower so here's hoping the tablet picks up, since I do think it is a good product.\n\nJust one more thing, mine said New but apparentely was refurbished. Have not experienced any problems with it though. Just the power button seems more recessed than it should be."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "A tablet should be Easy, Fast and Capable.  I have just completed setup on one of the two I bought.  This one is Not Easy.  For example:\n-No content behind tthe Get Started icon.  That left me searching for some instructions on what to do.\n-Dead end instructions: More than once I followed a link or instructions only to find either they didn't go anywhere or required some other action that was unspecified.  For Example: When I typed the URL for Bridge it just gave the errof message that it was not configured for my device.  No instructions on what to do next.  This kind of thing happened over and over.\n-Help is nearly useless.  It will instruct the user to find information in a specific heading.  But that heading is not there.  Also, Help is only available online.  With 64G it would have been easy to put it in the machine so users could learn the machine without having WiFi available.(Some of us travel and WiFi isn't always conveniently available.)\n-It is S L O W to turn on.  It takes Two Minutes to turn on after pressing the On Button.  Once On speed is satisfactory.\n\n-Downloaded Owners Guide is a .pdf file that is not interactive and is not consistent between index and content..  In this day and age?  Really?\n\nWell you get the idea.  This machine is not easy out of the box.  Guess that may not be unique.  The person next to me was setting up a Kindle.  She was asked for Port information for WiFi setup.\n\nI have only used it a wee bit.  Operational speed seems to be good.  Bridge works like a champ. Predictive text for email and data input is very good.  Screen quality is excellent.\n\nIn short: I bought it because of advertising and price.  Initial problems have more to do with manufacturer's attitude and failure than the machine itself.  I think in the end it is going to do the job.  A further report later.\n\nADDED:\n\nNow I have had the Playbook for a week and have used it quite a bit. Bottom line it is a capable book reader and music player.  The screen display is great.  But; Blackberry customer suppport is at least 20 years out of date.  I wasted hours following instructions while thinking that somehow I had done something wrong.  In fact the instructions were wrong and/or misleading.\n\nThere are some surprising gaps in how the Playbook works.  For example each Bookmark must be individually entered instead of transferring as a group from another commputer.  Only certain email, calendar, contact information can be synchronized or transferred.  That fact isn't clear from setup or synchronization displays.\n\nIf you want a book reader, a good music player and movie player and limited email it is a good value at the Amazon price.  If you have a BlackBerry smartphone they work well in combination."}

Then when it arrived and I started to play around with it, I was happier. Now that I have owned it for longer than my last tablet (Lenovo -died after 31 days) survived I am even happier. Adding a few apps, especially the Navigator from OBJ Studio, has now pushed my level of happiness beyond my expectations. Don't believe the negative hype about not enough apps -there are plenty, more than enough for the vast majority of users, including avid \"gamers\".\nNo device is without it's quirks, which are no doubt influenced by the \"loose nut behind the wheel\" as much as anything, but the Playbook's are minimal. The quality of the video/photo playback is excellent, and while I doubt I will use it the cameras for serious filmmaking (I have used clips taken with the rear -5mg- camera in a short documentary) it is surprisingly very good quality.\nThe \"32 GB\" (never is really 32 more like 29) is more than adequate for storing my video reel and photo slideshows. While not as \"powerful\" as a laptop it is much easier to carry.\nAll in all the Blackberry Playbook is turning out to be one of my better investments.

I was very unhappy with amazon for recommending yellow deals who are such a sleazy bunch of scum.\nBlackberry were very supportive when I explained I had paid for a new unit Blackberry suport arranged  to have the old defective unit yellow deals sent me for repair. The repair people sent me back a new working playbook.\nI have of course a great respect for Blackberry support. I have nothing but disgust with Yellow Deals and wonder why amazon deal with them.\n\nTo be fair yellow deals customer service did offer to replace the used defective unit they shipped but that would have required me to have it shipped to a Buffalo address then driving over the border again to pick it up, paying customs duty and driving 1 1/2 hours home again. I felt that there was a significant risk that Yellow Deals would ship crap again so I continues to work with Blackberry.\n\nNEVER EVER DEAL WITH YELLOW DEALS I TELL EVERYBODY"}

To get this much (64 gb model) for less than 1/2 price of 64 gb IPod is the steal of the century!\nFirst impressions: The device has a very high quality \"touch\" to it, along with a solid heft uet not too. Some devices I saw did not have this sense of a being quality build device.\nSecond - After I turned it on and went through a few minutes of important updates (to get to the v. 2 sofware), I was blown away by the quality of the graphics and the true mult-tasking of the apps as they track around.  The gestures to move between apps and the operations of the tablet are both logical and very cool too.  The blazing fast browser, via Wi-Fi, is faster than my laptop. At 7 inches, the tablet can fit into the front pocket of ones pants.\nI hope RIMM can catch some market share with the new phones coming our this week. As a former BB user now with a Samsung Andriod model, I can not wait to get back to BB.  My wife has the newer version of the BB Bold and it is a well build machine.\nGood Luck RIMM (PS, I am not a RIMM employee nor do not live in Canada, just someone impressed with what BB is doing recently).\n*********************************************************************************************************************************************************\n12/2/2014\nThis Playbook is now a a digital doorstop as Blackberry has stopped supporting this device. They brought in the new software QNX initially but never upgraded to BB10. Now, this device does not communicate with Windows 8 computers, cannot download music or any other media, and there are no new apps as the platform has been abandoned. The browser is very slow at this point.\n\nAvoid this product at any price."}

Like this because it makes it feel like a QUALITY, product in your hands. What most people won't like about this tablet is the amount of free apps, that it doesn't have. Can't get Angry Birds free, being its operating system is not an Android operating system. What else does this tablet have to make it worth buying? The camera and battery life. Every scenic picture taken with the camera makes it look interesting. Makes the scenic pictures that would have been a boring looking picture, into something that you wonder \"where is that\". Makes the photo look like a whole different world. The battery, not sure if you can get a tablet with a better battery life, at this point. Does last a long time. Another thing people may not like is the boot up time. Sometime you just want to be able to turn it in really quick and play your favorite game. I think that slow boot up somehow helps out alot with the battery life though. Since. Not a problem for me. If this will extremely annoy you then just put the tablet in sleep mode, instead of shutting down."}

Do a search on the internet on how people use their Ipads. I am sure this is true for other devices.\n\nWhat I like about the Playbook over the Ipad,\n1. Multi Tasking\n2. Gestures (no constant pressing a button to change apps)\n3. Blackberry Bridge (with my bold connected it is superb)\n4. HDMI output - this works great with any TV, it uses the full screen (not like IPad) no extra accessories (only cable, not like the Ipad) it can also use the Bold's touch screen and keypad for input.\n5. The size - Ipad have just woke up to this with the Ipad Mini.\n6. The build - as good as the Ipad if not better.\n7. The price - recent discounting gives you 4 64gb Plybooks for 1 64gb Ipad.\n8. The mini usb port far more friendly that the Ipad (Apple cannot even stick to one format).\n\nI think the Ipad is great but has it limitation, the Playbook is great and combined with a BlackBerry Bold it is a great business tool.\n\nOn balance I think the Playbook wins out just on the points above but I am always open to persuasion.\n\nI hope this helps anyone wanting to choose.\n\nI have not mentioned the Nexus 7 but it is good and a treat for those that like to change things all the time, with the correct firmware it is the fastest tablet, but not for the faint hearted.\n\nAlso if you want to see what the playbook can achieve go here and have a look at the video not an Ipad in site in the Porsche  [...]"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "After reading how these Playbooks will be upgradeable to the Blackberry 10, I did a little research and found MANY favorable reviews for them.  Since the price is definitely right, I decided to order one and...  I am SO glad I did!  This thing is nothing short of fantastic!  Yeah, I've read how people are complaining about the lack of apps, but there are still over 25,000 apps available for this tablet.  That seems small compared to the 100,000+ apps for an iPad, but let's be realistic:  This tablet has its fair share of apps and there is enough in there for everyone!  The size is a nice size which falls between my cell phone and my laptop, and it fits nicely in my hands.  Quality?  Second to none.  This thing is solid and operates great.  It's also VERY easy to use and operates smoothly.  True multitasking at its finest!!!  It can also be tethered to my cell phone, which is a nice feature.  It can link to my cell phone and I can use my data plan, using this tablet anywhere.  Google it online and you will see quite a few reviews about how this blows away the iPad Mini.  Apple snobs dislike this device, but for the rest of us who are not snobs, this is THE tablet to have!!!\n\nEDIT:  I have now had the Playbook for almost three weeks and it is fantastic!  I use it every single day and it's working perfectly.  Battery life is great (about 8 hours under \"normal\" use) and with the rapid charger, charges up in a reasonable amount of time.  As for apps, I have quite a few Android apps on it and they are working well.  Yes, it is a little bit of work to sideload some apps, but it can be done pretty easily and they do work.  Kindle?  Installed and working great!  The Blackberry App Store has MANY good apps to download, with many being free or 99-cents.  The Playbook is so great that my girlfriend bought the same one a few days after I did, and she can't put it down, either.  I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of Blackberry 10, but in the meantime, the current V2.1 OS is working great.  I honestly can't find one complaint about this Playbook.  For the price, you just can't go wrong!  I would *HIGHLY* recommend opting for the 64GB version.  It's not much more than the 16GB or 32GB versions, and it gives plenty of room to store all your software, music and photos!"}

I googled it and found a video that shows you step by step how to do that. In fact the latest update lets you run android apps on your tablet, you just have to figure out how to get them on there. There's no rooting or anything, you really just need the file for the app and a computer program.\n\nThis tablet is astounding! The power it has is amazing. I do not have a Blackbery phone but I am considering getting one now that I have the Playbook. It's simply amazing what you can do on it and the apps that can be found on it.

Once the Android apps are outdated it forces you to update from the Google Play store which is not supported.\nI was excited for this tablet, I really was. It lasted a week until I was bored. Sure, it literally has the BEST OS on a tablet but it falls short with no substance.\nBlackberry... we are counting on you come January 30.

Google this, it happens very, very, very often no matter how careful you are.  The port is rediculously fragile.  Shame on Blackberry for not making it more durable, remains to be seen if they will survive their lack of reading the market (not just tablets, smart phones also).  Kudos to Amazon for taking it back and refunding my money.  I liked it enough to buy a replacement, however,  if you get the playbook, get a magnetic charger which works great and isn't fragile at all.  Save the micro USB for connecting to your computer."}

My wife owns an iPad 2 and the only thing I prefer on her tablet is the App Store from Apple. It's simply a great quality feeling, looking and operating tablet. You cannot beat the price either now that RIM has dropped it so low.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Was trying to decide which tablet to get for my own use. ASUS and Nexus almost got me to bite. Then this little guy caught my eye. I did not even originally consider it. Had some decent reviews on the net plus can now run Android Apps.\n\nApprehensive at first but went for it to be able to bridge with my corporate provided BB smartphone. Figured I could not be that disappointed at the greatly reduced prices. Went for the max with memory and got the 64 GB version(too low cost to pass up).\n\nSurprise! It does everything I want it to do and much more. I particularly like to stream 1080P movies to my HDTV with it via HDMI, much better than the home theater components with built in WIFI. The BB bridging function allows me to access work email without using VPN and gives me more flexibility and ease of dealing with the myriad of emails I get. I also like the size, perfect for travel. Easier to handle and use than a larger tablet.\n\nI have successfully sideloaded many Andoid apps not available on App World and they work flawlessly. Decent battery life - lasts all day. Latest update did significantly speed up browsing which was fairly good to begin with. My son tried it out over the holidays and discovered it was faster than his $600 tablet.\n\nBB has always been good to me. I hope BB 10 is a sucess so they survive. I still can do more REAL work with a BB than with other smart phones."}

I was looking for a tablet I could easily fit in my purse, this is compact and sturdy. I was also looking for one with a nice camera, front and rear facing, tho there's no flash, it takes beautiful pictures with a fast shutter speed. Transferring media from my computer to tablet was very easy. Now that you can get a lot of Android apps and games on the playbook (with some maneuvering on the computer) it is a GREAT option for those not wanting to spend too much money on the tablets that run on android . Getting the android apps was a little time consuming, especially for someone not too tech savvy, but I googled \"Android apps for blackberry playbook guides\" and eventually figured it out....over all, definitely glad I bought the playbook!"}

The size is optimal for my purpose which is mostly business, but also for play.  My son has a 10 in. Asus Android tablet which is way too big, IMO.  For something that big I have my laptop which is much more functional.  So the PlayBook size is ideal.\n\nOn features, the HDMI connector is awesome for using with projector or TV. The home screen works much like a regular desktop which shows the running applications and makes closing them so much easier than on an Android, yes I own one of those too (Kindle Fire). The forward facing speakers are another great feature.  Battery life is very good even when streaming HD videos.\n\nOn apps, this is where we fall a little short.  But the available ones are very good and the options are always expanding with the capabilities of side loading Android apps if you choose to go that route.\n\nI find the UI on the Playbook much easier to use than the competitors, although there are similarities.  The Web browser is so far one of the best with the capability of playing right out the box any embedded video found on lots of video websites.\n\nOverall, this is my tablet of choice, even though it had a rocky start on the market."}

I use it regularly, and it's apps are clearly superior -- everyone knows this. However, hands down, the tablet I pick up the most for regular tinkers is the Playbook. I find the IPad heavy, big, and cumbersome, vs. the Playbook's perfect size for reading and surfing the internet. When I don't have a light, I use the Kindle app (sideloaded) on the Playbook instead of my Kindle. Plus, at $120 vs $800, I'm not nearly as worried about the Playbook geting \"dinged\" or thrown around a little bit.\n\nI don't think that tablets are yet laptop replacements. If they were, I would suggest the IPad. However, since I still need to use my laptop for most things, if it's between the two, pick up the Playbook - it's a sweet buy.

There are five aspects in a tablet I wanted: portability, mailing capabilities, Facebook/social networking/fun apps, calendar/memos, and voice/video chat...so I'll address each of these in the context of my playbook.\n\nFacebook/social networking/apps: There have been lots of complaints about the lack of apps, which I originally snubbed as well, but after a day, I realized that the Web browser works so well, I can access my pinterest, Facebook, and blogs without even missing the app aspect....I have an iphone, so I have the Facebook and pinterest apps on there, and honestly, the websites via the playbook browser are SO much nicer to use...the pages you view are not the mobile versions like with my iphone...it's just like my laptop, but fits nicely in my hands.  So who cares about no apps. (there is a Facebook app, but I still prefer the Web version)\n\nMailing: The mail app that comes with the playbook is very easy to use and sync my emails with.  So far, everything works as I need, and I know I have new emails the second the come in...In fact, I've already gotten 2 while writing this review.\n\nCalendar/memos: The calendar is great, also quite easy to navigate and I am able to link my Gmail calendar to it with no problems.  There is a voice memo app that I may try to use, but just a basic memo app has to be installed from the app store.  There seems to be a large number of note/memo apps, but I haven't tried any yet.  For now I have been making notes in the document compiler, similar to Word, and you are able to save, cut/paste from emails and websites.  There is also a spreadsheet compiler that appears to work like excel, but haven't tested yet.\n\nPortability: fits perfectly in any of my purses, and easy to carry around. I just wish I could get it on a data plan with my service provider.  There appears to be ways to get wifi off your cellphones, but I don't know how to do that. So I don't like that I'm limited to wifi hotspots.\n\nVideo chat: there is one that allows you to video chat from one blackberry device to another, but none of my friends/family have blackberries, so this is lost on me. There is no Skype, which breaks my heart and it appears there is no universal app to video with anyone, so you can either video other blackberry users or no one.  This is probably the biggest loss for me.\n\nOverall, I love my new playbook...I think it just needs a few more users and friends so that we can get data plans and Skype apps!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "As a (close to!) 60 year old, I consider myself technology challenged.  When it comes to electronics, I like things to be simple.  I was desiring a tablet for mainly just two reasons.  I wanted something I could download books to for reading purposes and something I could easily take pictures with and then quickly upload them to Facebook.  I was originally planning on buying a Kindle Fire HD, but my 21 year old daughter convinced me the Blackberry Playbook was a much better buy.  I think she was absolutely correct.  I found if I had bought the Kindle Fire, I would have had to buy the charger, a leather case and screen protectors all separately; having to spend $200 for the Kindle Fire alone, then 20 for the charger, 30 for the leather case and $6.00 for screen protectors.  With the purchase I paid for the (originally $599.00) Blackberry playbook; I paid only $150 and that included the leather case, a charger and screen protectors.  I haven't used it much, seeing as how it is a Christmas present this year, but I have played with it enough to know it easily meets my original wants, (downloading books, taking pictures and getting on Facebook with ease) but it does SO MUCH more!!  It is essentially a mini-computer, which I can also use for writing and editing documents for work.  I have to admit I need instructions on how to use its many applications and abilities, but my daughter has assured me she will be a willing instructor and I am very excited about using it.  The visual quality is beyond excellent, and the pictures I have taken are wonderful.  I was also very happy to discover I can skype with my daughter, family and friends.  I feel this is a truly wonderful purchase!\n\nADDED INFORMATION:  I have now been using my Blackberry for a full month.  I love it more than ever!  It is an amazing device! It is SOOOO worth the purchase!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I am somewhat a Tablet Freak. I own a Nexus 7, a Kindle Fire HD, an iPad Mini, and I just bought a Blackberry Playbook. The Playbook is truly excellent as a device. It is solid, sturdy, the screen is beautiful, the touch is responsive. I like the way the bezel is touch sensitive, and certain functions and menus are invoked by swiping the bezel. I also like the UI, the way the app drawer appears below the main screen and the way the apps open in the middle of the screen and then expand to fill the screen. In short, the Playbook has almost become my favorite EXCEPT FOR ONE THING!!!!! That one thing is the disappointing sparcity of useful applications; there just are not many. I'm not comparing the raw number against iOS or Android. A few really good apps are all that are. necessary, and those are sorely lacking. I have not found a good search engine, browser or office suite. I have heard that RIM will begin making Android apps available for the Playbook \"SOON\". RIM seems to have \"SOON\" as its company motto! Everything is GOING to happen SOON; RIM just does not deliver on its promises of \"SOON\".\n\nI think it's a lamentable shame. The Playbook is such a well-built device, but RIM does not seem to support it well.. If it had the necessary support from RIM, the Playbook would definitely merit five stars. However, because of the lack of support, three stars is all I can justify,"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I love this device!  The 1080p HD display is stunning!  Other tablets have fancy names for their display, this one delivers true 1080P HD video.  The Operating System is a true multi-tasking OS, so you can run numerous apps simultaneously.  Play music while browsing the Internet, while you have Excel open working on your spreadsheet... just like on a personal desktop computer.  The built-in wireless lets me connect to my home or corporate network with ease, as well as hot-spots, and browse the web with speed.  There's even a Remote Desktop app so you can log on to other computers on your network.\n\nSpeaking of the web, the BB Playbook has a real web browser with Adobe PDF reader, HTML5, Flash, and everything else you need to browse the web.  This is a true tabbed browser, letting you open multiple pages in tabs, just like on your home PC. The Favorites page has thumbnails/logos of each page.  The built-in speakers have surprisingly good sound, although you probably want bluetooth or wired speakers if you're going to be listening live in your living room, and earphones for personal use.\n\nThe BB Playbook has USB 2 and HDMI ports, so you can use the Playbook to drive a large screen HDTV by using an HDMI cable.  Even more than that, you can use your Blackberry smart phone as a remote control device/mouse.  Hook the Playbook to your big screen, use you BB smartphone as a mouse, and you have an instant presentation machine, using the built-in Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint or PDF, web browser, e-amil, YouTube or whatever you want.  You can also open files that are on your BB smartphone directly on the Playbook!  Transferring files from my PC to the BB Playbook is a snap, you just use Windows to transfer the files from your local Documents or Library to the Playbook network Public folder - drag and drop, nothing to it.\n\nIt has a native e-mail app that I use for my Yahoo! and Hotmail accounts, and I use BB Bridge to connect to my corporate Exchange mailbox.  The Playbook also has Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, so you can connect the native e-mail app directly to your corporate mail.\n\nAfter only a week, we have been using it for:\n-tracking medications\n-creating spreadsheets (such as home inventory)\n-email (3 separate accounts) and web browsing\n-youtube player\n-online shopping\n-music player & video player\n-alarm clock and timer\n-eBook reader\n-apps: Resistor color codes, audio sinewave generator, eBook reader (native), piano player, various social games, dictionary, Bible w/ text and text-to-speech.\n\nThere are also good speech to text and text to speech aps.\n\nUnlike some popular tablets, this tablet is not merely a web browser/email reader, Angry Birds player, or some toy to keep your kids or cats occupied, it's a real personal and business productivity machine."}

I always appreciated the size of the playbook and sold a first generation iPad to justify splurging. What a disappointment this product has been. The battery life does not even touch the next worst competitor, and a standby time of less then 48 hours will drive anyone crazy. I now have an iPad mini and a nexus 7, two far superior tablets that offer the same kind of portability of the blackberry with much better operating systems. QNX is promising but in two years there have been only minor fixes while iOS and Android devices have received entire new versions and countless new hardware offerings. When i first purchased this i was using a bold 9700, bridge support was SO SLOW it was unusable. SD Card support through bridge was the slowest part.  The tethering feature on my iPhone feeds data to all my devices and works a million times better.\n\nMy biggest complaints are\n\nBuggy browser - just try reading a news blog. You are constantly forced to \"re-find\" your scroll position when navigating. Its been long enough this issue should have been addressed by now.\nTerrible standby time - Its just unacceptable. Blackberry phones were much better then this, what happened?\nLack of app's -  Speaks for itself\nBlackberry bridge - Slow Slow Slow Slow Slow.... I got tired of snail speed on the blackberry itself as well.\n\nAll in all this device is no longer relevant on todays market. if you are shopping for a low cost tablet i recommend staying far away from the Blackberry and looking at the popular offerings from Apple and Google."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "First of all I have only had this tablet a few days so I do not know how it will perform in the long term. However with the few knowledge I have about it so far I must say that in my opinion it is among the best tablets out there. I don't know how they did it but this thing is a real work horse capable of doing a lot of things at the same time with no negative effect on it's performance. I mean you can open games, pictures, email, app world, web browser and watch a 1080p video with no difference at all. Tell me how many tablet can do that. I have never used an Ipad but I heard it is the best out there however I just sold an Asus Transformer that I had for six months and I can assure you that the Playbook is more superior when it comes to performance in my opinion. The screen quality is spectacular making web pages appear almost real. 1080p videos and pictures are just the way they are suppose to be and if there are any short comings I have not and may not be in position to notice them. The sound quality put the Asus Transformer to shame. Sometimes I wonder if the two front facing cameras are not surround sound. Build quality is great with a rubberized back that care less about where you put it. I used to prefer 10' tablet but after using the Playbook I may have changed mind. It fits just fine in my hands. The keyboard is the best touch screen qwerty keyboard I have ever used. Well laid out, very responsive and just gets the job done with little to no errors.\n\nCONS: The biggest issue and drawback for the Playbook is the lack of apps. I'm not talking about having hundreds of thousands of them but making sure the popular apps that people cannot live without are available and work well. The lack of an sd card slot may be a big con to those with the 16GB or even the 32GB version but not much to worry about if you have the 64GB version like I do. I just cannot see myself needing anything bigger than that in a tablet.\n\nOVERALL I have more good things to say about the Playbook than otherwise. I must also say if Blackberry 10 upgrade becomes true then I plan to keep this tablet for a very long time. There are so many positive things I left out that you can find out yourself if you decide to get one."}

They don't put any buttons on the front of the tablet like Samsung Galaxies but rather maximize the screen space by making swipe gestures into the \"HOME\" button.  It's also very thin and light.  It was the nicest tablet I've ever used...I liked it!\n\nThe only downside of this is the same con with Apple iPod Touches and iPhones...it has no micro SD slot.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I would like to start by saying I currently have the iPad 3 as well as the iPhone 5; and I have had Android devices in the past.\n\n This Playbook tablet is quicker and more glitch free than the Android devices I have used. It loads aps in seconds, and browser pages almost as fast as my iPad. The Playbook browser is capable of flash, so you can watch embedded videos and media in your browser without having to open a separate ap. It does have a dedicated YouTube ap, as well as a Facebook ap. It also has an email client/ap, as well as video chat aka Face Time.\n\nFor faster web browsing, you can enable/disable Javascript and Flash with a quick swipe- by swiping from the top down while browsing and selecting the content icon. This results in near instantaneous loading of pages, otherwise you get a several second lag. I only enable Javascript or Flash when the web page requires it and I need the functionality it brings.\n\nThe other tip I have and its a BIGGIE, is, Get The Rapid Charger Immediately and use it. [...]Blackberry Rapid Charging Stand for Playbook - Retail Packaging - Black]]  The Playbook Rapid Charger or Playbook Charging Pod/Stand uses a magnetic three (thick) prong receptacle that is far sturdier, as well as charges much faster. The stand can be found on Amazon for about $17 total with shipping. It is currently $6 cheaper than the Rapid Charger wall plug.  [...] Blackberry Rapid Travel Charger for Playbook - Retail Packaging - Black]]\n The charging cord that they give you is a micro USB; and anyone who has had one of these stop working on their cell phone knows what I am speaking of. Not only that- the charger has a Blackberry icon on the top side that goes in the port, with the USB symbol on the bottom side. This is contrary to industry standards calling for the USB symbol to be inserted with the top side up. RIM Blackberry also decided to use a dual AB micro USB for the charging/data port instead of just a B type, which means that you can insert the cable in upside down(which would be industry standard correct). If you insert this charging cable in upside down even ONCE, you can kill the port. Some recommend putting a white or red dot on the proper side so this (costly) mistake isn't made. eBay is full of Playbooks for sale with bad micro USB ports.\n\nI would like to mention that Office Depot had a great Clearance Sale of the 64 GB model Playbook at $150. They sold out quickly. I found one in a store in Palm Bay, Florida; and a manager named Brian was kind enough to go out of his way to have it transferred/shipped cross country to my local store. I am very grateful for what Brian did and I would go out of my way to shop at his Office Depot location as a result of his awesome dedication to customer service."}

The screen and the sound quality are exceptional, and 64GB is fine for my purposes.\nThis combination is why I bought the Blackberry Playbook, and why I am glad I did: it has wonderful visual clarity, great sound and decent storage at a very good price.\nThe app aspect is obviously extremely important: you have to know exactly what you want this tablet for, and what the available apps will and won't do.\nSo far, my basic software needs have been easily satisfied. In this, I am in a minority. I wanted a simple browser, decent audio and video software, a good file manager, and an epub reader.\nAnd in particular, I wanted to be able to play my personal audio and video files from different sources- which is working well so far.\nThen I added a few extras, as everyone does, according to interests. I'm all set. But before buying this lovely little device, make sure you can use it according to your needs.\nI am delighted, rather than disappointed, because I knew what I wanted before I bought it.\n\nI read about the screen, but that didn't prepare me for just how clear and beautiful it really is. I knew the sound quality was very good too, but I was still surprised at just how good.\nBattery life is excellent so far. WiFi has been painless, and browsing has been easy. My desktop installed the device drivers and set up the Playbook without any problem.\nThe included charger works just fine, and I ordered a separate rapid charger too, along with a good case.\nI know I have barely touched the surface of what this device is capable of, but I'm not in a hurry. I enjoy leisurely meandering around in the world of possibilities.\nAll in all, I find this device somewhat astonishing: the sheer quality of it has exceeded my expectations by quite a bit.\n\nHaving said that, I will add that if anything goes badly wrong, I will come back here and report it. Stars will fall.\nMeanwhile though, I am enjoying this as much as I have ever enjoyed any gadget, and then some.\n\nUpdate- nearly 2 years later:\nTablets come and go, sometimes bringing frustration and dissatisfaction in their wake. (I still can't finesse my relatively new Dell Venue 8 Pro to function properly, no matter what. It exists as a permanent annoyance, neither mercifully dying nor ever working very well. Ugh.)  But meanwhile, the Blackberry Playbook is humming along as beautifully as ever. It has never given me a moment's trouble in all this time. Even the battery still charges well. When I use it always I feel a little surge of gratitude, as you might feel for an older car that has always been a peach rather than a lemon. It shows no degradation from use, and that of course is the mark of exceptionally well-made technology. I wish now I had bought another one when it was on sale for 100$, since I see that it is currently selling for nearly twice the price it was 2 years ago! And I am very glad I bought the rapid charger and a good case too- for extremely low prices. I am sorry though that all this personal happiness (great device, relatively very small cost) is at the expense of Blackberry. They built the world's most well-constructed tablet I know of so far, and for their trouble received terrible publicity. But as I wrote in my original review, I knew exactly what it would and would not do before I bought it, and it remains a champion of enjoyable reliability.\n\nUpdate: 3 years later. I still enjoy this tablet every day. No aspect of what I loved about it in the first place has diminished over time. The battery is still great, the sound remains better than any other tablet I have, and its excellent peripherals are still working as well as ever. It has still never given me any trouble of any kind.\n\nThe same cannot be said for my experience with other tablets. After a year or so of constant tinkering and tweaking my Dell Venue 8 Pro, it is finally working well. For now. But although I finally like it, the high price I paid in time and vexation left a very bad taste. Worse yet, users are having trouble upgrading it to Win 10. So if I want to do that, I probably have more misery to look forward to. And as for the original Nexus 7, there are many things I liked about it, and still enjoy. But its cheap construction means if I want to go on using it, I'll have to crack the case and install new parts. I might try that, but then it never worked perfectly in the first place either. So it too has left a bad taste despite many great features.\n\nThe early failure of otherwise promising tablets from poor software or too-cheap parts is an ongoing problem in the tablet world. I know it all depends on the person and the tablet, and no two experiences are the same. But so far, this has been mine."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I will state that I never intend to purchase an Apple product, ever.  That being said, I looked around for a while before deciding on purchasing the BB tablet.  Besides the Kindle Fire, you won't find another 32gb tablet from a major manufacturer on the market selling for less than $200.  I considered the Fire, but after reading reviews, determined it is more oriented towards media consumption (NetFlix, Kindle, music, that type of stuff).  The PlayBook is more oriented to business/travel, with lots of integrated tools (like conversion app, a scientific calculator, documents to go, etc).  Since I intend on using my PlayBook for \"mobile computing\" while traveling, it seemed like a better fit.\n\nI haven't used my PlayBook exhaustively yet, but I am very impressed by it's long battery life.  I literally took it off charging at 10am today and used it all day to write emails, read magazine articles, Google things, and play chess, yet over 12 hours later still had 60% of my battery.\n\nWith the site goodereader.com, you can put Android apps on your PlayBook.  This is on top of the BlackBerry \"App World\".  That means you have access to the most apps of any tablet, since Android has the most and you get BlackBerry's on top of that.\n\nThe predictive text on the PlayBook is excellent- it greatly speeds up the process of writing things.  I would actually say I am nearly as quick in composing things on the PlayBook as I am by typing on a keyboard.\n\nAltogether, the \"controls\" on the keyboard are fairly intuitive.  They are similar to what the Palm Pre used, and mostly involve \"swiping\" things.  You can have quite a few things running concurrently, and just cycle through them as is convenient for you.\n\nThe internet access on the PlayBook is almost exactly the same thing as using a computer.  I can do my Spanish homework using my PlayBook, even though it runs through some special program.  I like how it also gives you the option to read a page as an article, so you don't have to adjust the size of the page to make it fit properly, or worry about inadvertently clicking something on the page.\n\nSo, I highly recommend the PlayBook.  As a fringe benefit, when the BB 10 comes out, you will be able to sync the PlayBook and it together, to share information."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "If you love your BlackBerry, you will love the PlayBook! I got the 64MB model and I LOOOOOOOOOOVE LOVE LOVE it! I'm not a fan of touch screen keyboards (and even with the touch keys bigger, I still hit the wrong keys) but I don't use it for typing emails or texts, I use it for checking emails and surfing the internet. I do minimal typing on it. I've paid a bill or two on it and all I can say is enlarging the screen really helps! Further, if you have a BlackBerry, you can use it as a remote control for the PlayBook so you can type on the PlayBook using the keys on your BlackBerry! It is fast too. You can't do everything you would on a netbook or laptop but it isn't meant to. For example, it really came in handy when I was on my last trip whereas when I have taken my netbook or laptop, while they were great for uploading pictures to, they were AWFUL accessing the internet! Not enough RAM or something but you know, when you're just sitting around at the airport waiting for your connecting flight or waiting for your car to be finished at the dealership, it passes the time quickly and you're not ready to pull your hair out bec the unit is so slllooow... The PlayBook is fast. The only thing is you do need a wireless connection, it's not a Smartphone and they operate on different technology. I have the T-Mobile wireless modem (the Hotspot, it's the equivalent to Verizon's Jetpack which I couldn't get bec I would have lost my unlimited data package adding the Jetpack as a second \"phone\" line, bec Verizon no longer offers unlimited data packages. T-Mobile's gain! It will work at a Starbuck's or Barnes and Noble, or anywhere that offers free Wi-Fi. The other thing is the initial set up. You might have problems even if you have a wireless router at home which I do. I wasn't able to complete my initial set up of the PlayBook at home- I was stuck at selecting a country (U.S.) yet there was nothing in the drop down menu to select! I had to go sit at a Barnes and Noble to do it. But... we all know nothing is perfect and we all know that, despite BlackBerry's quirky issues, us CrackBerry addicts are what we are, and I don't feel like I'm missing anything not having an iPAD! I hope BlackBerry keeps it up!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I have so many great things to say about this tablet that I scarcely know where to begin.\n\nI don't take purchases like this lightly. Some people may not give a second thought to spending upwards of $400 on the latest tech toy, but I do. Even though I got my PlayBook for $200 from Office Depot, it's still a significant investment in my book.\n\nNow - I am a fan of RIM, but I assure you I thoroughly researched all available tablets, I played with them in stores, I talked to tablet owners, etc. I am also an ex-professional IT nerd who still keeps up with things. I have also owned Android phones and an iPod Touch, hence I am very familiar with Android and iOS.\n\nThe technological argument: The PlayBook uses QNX. It's a true multi-thread operating system. Rather than try to give you a tech 101 lesson, I will say if you are tech inclined, just Google it and read for yourself.\nAs for Android, I don't like it. That surprised me because I am primarily a Linux user at home, leading me to believe that Android would be great. In short, Android is a huge data pig, with security holes and massive inefficiencies.\niOS may be a derivative of Mac OS which is Unix based... Which is better than Windows in my book, but iOS also leaves a lot to be desired, including lag, memory inefficiencies, and other things I'll cover in the user experience assessment.\n\nThe Hardware Argument: the PlayBook, like all RIM products, feels solid and dependable. The size is perfect, and balances nicely in your hand. The back has a nice silicone type coating making it just grippy enough to hang on to securely while not being obtrusive. I don't feel like I have to handle it with kidskin gloves for fear of damaging a glossy exterior. When I got my iPod Touch I immediately had to spend an extra $45 to get the Invisible Shield (a great product btw) so the shiny aluminium back and delicate screen wouldn't get destroyed, plus a silicone skin for some added impact protection. Be honest - how many iPhones have you seen with shattered screens? Exactly. If you look at an Apple product cross eyed, the damn thing breaks. All the Android tablets felt equally flimsy to me. As for the eReaders that are adding Web and video capabilities, I remind you that they are just that: an eReader. The additional features are disappointing underperformers.\nThe PlayBook screen quality is astounding. Everything on it, including video, looks better than my Desktop LCD monitor. Seriously.\nThe speakers are equally wonderful. They sound better than my sister's fancy-pants new laptop. Incidentally, I'm a musician... So yeah - that matters.\nFor connections, the HDMI port is (blessedly) separate, instead of the absurd proprietary single port that the iOS devices have. This means I can run video out from my PlayBook while charging if I need to. The USB input is nice too for us fast typists when the Bluetooth keyboards will lag.\nIt has a front and rear camera, I'll admit I haven't yet played with them.\n\nUser Experience: in an attempt to shorten this somewhat, I will say that the multi-tasking is seamless, the gestures are super intuitive, the full Web browsing experience WITH FLASH support is great. I have had zero issues with lag or freezing or anything of the sort. I especially appreciate the buttonless experience. I was admittedly sceptical, but it took me all of a few hours to get it down to second nature. I should also point out that the devices with the multi-function \"home/exit/etc\" button will, eventually fail, as my iOS device started doing recently.\nI must highlight the Predictive Text - it is eerily accurate. I have written entire sentences by only entering the first few letters of a few of the words and had the rest suggested. It is also very nice to once again have the ability to edit my own custom dictionary, which iOS would inexplicably not let me do.\nBattery life: I've been playing with this constantly for the last 5 hours and am at 60%. I have no complaints.\n\nThe Great App Debate:\nApple's App Store currently has over 700,000 apps.\nAndroid Market claims... Well, no one seems to know, or I can't seem to find an official number anyway. We can say at least 400,000 though.\nBlackBerry AppWorld: I'm hearing around 100,000.\nYep. That's a lot less. I don't know about you, but frankly I'm more interested in quality than quantity.\nI can tell you, of the 119 Apps I have installed on my iPod Touch, I use 16 of them regularly; at least 5 of those are really just glorified Web links.\n\n16. 16 Apps. I mean, come on people - how many Turkey Call Mimics or versions of solitaire do you need???\n\nYes, there are a few Apps I wish were on BB AppWorld, but it's nothing I can't accomplish via the web browser.\n\nFinally, to address some misconceptions and unfair criticisms:\n\nComplaints that there is no Expandable SD Memory card reader: well, the beloved iPad doesn't have one either. I can't see using up my entire 64 GB PlayBook, but even so I can access Cloud storage all the same.\n\nComplaints that there (was not at first) a cellular capable model: well, if y'all really like paying extra money for a superfluous wireless plan, you got it. The 4G/Wifi model is rolling out now. May I also point out that the iPad Wifi only model far outsells the cellular model.\n\nYou do NOT need to have a BlackBerry phone for Internet Tethering. Any mobile capable of tethering will work. Apparently depending on your carrier you may get extra Tethering charges, but that varies.\n\nBonus: RIM assures us that BlackBerry 10 OS will be available for the PlayBook.\n\nAt the end of the day, I bought the PlayBook to get real work done on the go, without lugging around a big old laptop. The PlayBook is delivering in spades.\nI had high hopes and was so afraid I would be let down. I have not been let down yet.\n\n********** Update: I have now tested the cameras and microphone and I am really pleased.\n\nThe camera takes really nice photos, plus it has a really cool stabilisation feature. I do wish it had an LED flash but I guess you can't have it all. Also, my Dad is getting a PlayBook now so we can video chat, which will be really nice.\n\nThe microphone is awesome. I need it primarily for recording workshops, and audio at rehearsals. I tested it first by having my husband speak while I deliberately left the television on to see how it would handle competing background noise. The resulting audio was clear and I didn't have to strain to separate the speech from the background noise.\nI then did some quick instrumental recording and that sounded great as well. I wouldn't be recording an album with it or anything but it was near demo quality. I am very impressed"}

Wen considering the price of the playbook is 4x cheaper than an Ipad, I'd choose a playbook every time.

At the price I got it at, you can't beat what I thought was a decent little tablet!\n\nI'm not gonna say it was a bad choice but I can say that it's not a great one either. This is my first ever review and I've bought tons of stuff on amazon. I'm a gadget geek and in the IT industry so I get a lot of exposure on all products. I have 2 iPads, a windows tablet w Windows 8 on it, an android tab and now a blackberry play book.\n\nThe play book is a great size and perfect for travel, it's light and responsive to touch and launching applications. I'm not 100% on how to access android apps if that's even possible but I've read you could... Although I'm not able to figure it out yet. In the blackberry App Store there are a few things that are cool, but it's limited. Right off the bat, no Netflix! Probably not a huge deal for some but for, I watch a lot of Netflix stuff.... There is an app but it only allows you choose a movie, then you gotta buy an app to watch it... Fail!\n\nI was attracted to it due to their neat commercials about the OS. The OS is not that great, it lacks a lot of luster and basic features you see on an iPad or android. I know it's geared toward business but in my opinion and as it turns out for RIM, it's not the opinion of most, it needs to be geared toward the largest crowd w available business-centric apps. Sorry blackberry play book, not doing so hot!\n\nI love my iPad and its not my everyday piece of computer technology, I use it at home, if I'm taking a trip that's not work related or taking a poop! (Honestly!) The OS is super smooth and you can't it's consumer friendly-ness.\n\nAll in all, if you can buy the play book for $100, go for it! It's a nice little tablet, but if its not on sale or a low price and your thinking about paying over $200 for it, save your money and buy the iPad mini that just came out, same size and way more bang for your buck.

This little item is a fantastic piece of equipment and meets my needs perfectly. It was pretty much turn it on and use it straight away. There was no learning curve or difficulty figuring out how to use it and I am in no way tech savy. The on screen keyboard works well for my needs but I have small hands my boyfriend found it frustrating to use the keyboard as it often triggers the wrong or multiple letters but much of this is mitigated by the word suggestions that pop up as you type. Overall an impressive piece of equipment for an awesome price."}

I prefer the playbook for several reasons,u get much more bang for your buck,its one third the price of an ipad.the size is ideal to carry around and it weighs lesser than the ipad,the on screen keypad is easier to use and has more letters and characters,its ideal to hold in both hands and use thumbs for typing.the display is good and so is th ui.got the otterbox also at a markdown amd they are made for each other,bb bridge is user friendly and if u own a bb smartfone there is no other tab u shud buy.  Main neg points are for limited apps,but iam finding my way around crackberry to get them and anyways iam not much into games,battery life is limited,about 4 hrs is a guestimate. At the present price its a steal,go and get it,iam getting one more for my teenager."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Its been a little over a couple of months since I purchased my 64G Playbook from Amazon. I travel a lot and hence a 7 inch tablet is a welcome relief from lugging around my laptop. With the updated software(OS Version 2.1.0.1032) start-up takes about less than 3 minutes. So far I have 125 applications, 380 music, 24 videos, 300 photos and 719 documents and books with still 37G to spare. The browser, for me, is fast and reliable, supporting flash which is a big plus for me. Battery life is pretty decent when i read books or watch movies. The update in the OS provides for the inclusion of SMS in the blackberry bridge which means I no longer need to pull out my phone to check on SMS from friend or the office. I bought the HDMI cable and an adapter which allows me to plug it into the tv set or pc monitor if i need a bigger screen when typing out documents or watching movies. I also use it for client presentations, hooking it up to a projector or their LED screens and I turn on the bridge and use it in presenter mode (yes this feature is also available in the more popular tablets, but it seems most of their owners have not familiarize themselves and hence are surprised and impressed when I do this with the playbook). Video Quality is OK but then again is dependent on the quality of the video you upload into your playbook. The cameras (3MP front and 5MP back) are great for shots with decent lighting (no flash). You can record videos (HD Quality as well).\n\nIf i am in a non-wifi spot I just tether it to my phone and and use my phone's data plan.\n\nI have not felt so far \"the lack of applications\" in the blackberry appworld as I already downloaded what I feel I need for now. Here are 25 of my most frequently used downloaded apps:\n\n1)  EPUB Book Reader\n2)  News 360\n3)  Box\n4)  Business Analysis Toolbox\n5)  Conqu\n6)  CreatePPT\n7)  Currency Converter\n8)  EasyNotes2\n9)  Groovy Notes\n10) Learn Thai\n11) Marketing 101\n12) Maps and GPS with Google Maps+\n13) My Travel Diary\n14) MyExpense Pro\n15) PDF Creator\n16) Scratch Pad\n17) Touch for Linkedin\n18) World Factbook Pro\n19) Fruit Slash\n20) Dead SPace\n21) Modern Combat\n22) Air Attack\n23) Shadow Gun\n24) Hangman\n25) Get brains\n26) Sleepster\n\nFacebook, NFS, Tetris, Docs to Go, You Tube, Print to go are already pre-loaded.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "There's a lot to like about the playbook, and some big drawbacks for a buyer considering taking advantage of their dramatic price drop in 2012. Be careful about reading 2011 reviews, a lot has changed in the tablet market in a short time.\n\nPRO\n1. Wonderful hardware and workmanship. It feels solid and is engineered nicely.\n2. Tethers to Blackberry phone.  If you have a BBerry phone, you'll enjoy being able to tap into the smaller device's emails, files, and especially its mobile wireless signal for internet on the go.\n3. Quick and responsive menus and software makes web surfing, email and typing a breeze.\n4. All this can be yours for a bargain price right now.\n\nCON\n1. Lousy app selection.  The BB app market is pretty close to laughable, and the much vaunted ability to load Andriod apps is very overblown.  Android app selection for Playbook is very limited and requires a decent amount of technical understanding and patience to pull off.\n2. Uncertain BB future.  It remains unclear whether the company will be around in a year to support the device.  A lot is riding on their delayed new OS for phones and tablets.  You are taking a risk buying one now.\n3. Multimedia is a pain.  I like lots of music and video choices.  This is where I was particularly disappointed.  There aren't many streaming radio services that work on playbook, though there are some. Crackle, Hulu, Netflix and Amazon video mostly don't work (yes some have found hacks, but don't count on it). Loading music files was also a pain.  With no SD slot, it has to be done via a wired connection, though it does support Windows 'drag and drop'.\n\nFor me: the bottom line is if you are a die hard Blackberry addict, take a shot at this. Returns with Amazon Prime are easy, the price is low for the features you get, making it worth a try. I like Blackberry, but am not dead set on it. Mine's probably going back for an Andriod tablet."}

The playbook is fantasic; the QNX OS is really great and easy to use.  I have android tablets but playbook is simply different.  Looks like alot of native apps like you tube and news reader are package web based items; repackaged and streamlined into an app.  I can read news without searching the web, since all the news are paged by topic in a native app.  The display is sharp; the speakers are awesome; overall just a great none android tablet but allow you to run android apps in their new android player (not an app) but invoked when any android applicaiton installed on the playbook is run.

I'm using this device as a stand-alone tablet, mostly for going online, reading ebooks and docs, creating docs, watching youtube and other vids, and playing games.\n\nFirst, the not-so-good, why I didn't give it 5 stars. There is no way to expand memory. No micro SD card slot. You can't connect a flash drive, even with an adapter. You need another computer to sideload.\n\nThere is no Kindle App avaiable and you are tied to Kobo for DRM books. There are apps for purchase that can read non-DRM books. If you already have books from Project Gutenberg, you cannot read them on the Kobo reader on Playbook you need to buy an app.\n\nThere is a free app to read Open Office and Libre Office files, but you can't edit the files. The Playbook cannot read or edit LO/ OO files that I switched to .doc, so I am unable to edit any of my previous files. This is more than annoying.\n\nI use Firefox browser on my laptop. There is no FF app for Playbook and it doesn't look like there will be any time soon. I'm used to being able to block ads, and sometimes that lacking feature gets annoying. You can block script on the included browser, but only globally. You cannot name/ rename bookmarks, although you can name them if you put them on the desktop instead of on the browser. No Hulu support, at least yet...\n\nEven with all that, here's why I like Playbook. The browser, outside of what I mentioned, is pretty good. It has some security/ control features that I like. It runs very smoothly and very fast. It has Flash support for youtube and other sites!\n\nSome complain about lack of apps in the store, but it suits me OK, with  the exception of the LO/ OO issue. I don't feel a need for a ton of apps, so it's OK. by me. Oh, there is android app support, but you can only really use android apps you get thru the Playbook store. This doesn't bother me, but I thought I'd mention it.\n\nThe OS is great! Runs fast, fluid, easy to use and the screen is wonderfully touch-sensitive. Pinch and zoom is fabulous. Very sharp images and wonderful color for movie/ youtube viewing. It's light-weight and feels good to hold. The back of the Playbook is grippy, so I don't worry so much about dropping it. I've found some good games at the app store, most are a pleasure to play. The app store continues to grow.\n\nI'm hoping that some day that the issues I metioned will be fixed. Because then this would be a 5 star device. Definitely a good deal at about the $200 amount."}

Well, I love that thing! Perfectly sized (I don't see the point in having 10 inch tablet cause it comes fairly close in size to small laptops which are by definition more functional, customizable etc). I neede the thing that would be more convenient to use than ipod Touch (nice'n'handy, but the screen is too small for anything serious) yet something smaller than my laptop so that I could take that newcomer with me while my backpack stays at home.\n\nFirst of all, I was really impressed by the multitasking implemented in that baby. For the first time I see it working as reliable and easy as alt-tab :) Second, it's really powerful, I tried many things to push Playbook to the limit but it never let me down, be it video streaming, browsing or gaming (and yes, there are plenty nice games released for it, hence the name is correct :) ). Playbook is rock-solid in terms of both hardware and software, lightweight and just plain beautiful.\n\nIt has decent software options as of current and the guys from RIM are working on it constantly, so I don't feel like I will be left behind (plus you may run Android apps on it). Overall, I am pleased with this purchase and believe it will keep me busy (and satisfied) for quite a long time.\n\nP.S.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Well to tell you the truth I hesitated when purchased this tablet. I had either owned or borrowed many many tablets, so checking this one was a matter of professional curiosity. I did not expect much, but the price was right, so I gave it a try. I always like when what you get exceeds your expectations. Before that I thought that WebOS is so much more ahead of competition in terms of UI, after I played with Playbook I think they are par with each other. What makes the UI amazing is the sensitive areas which go beyond the display. The bottom one used to switch between the open apps like in WebOS, and you can swype the app card away almost like in WebOS. Another unique element is if you swype from the top you get to the app menu, really cool! You can switch between the open apps if you swype from left or right bezel inwards. Speed of UI is great! Another great advantage you can install Android apps either through appetite or sideload them. Not the greatest choice here and they run in the same card, but it's better than nothing.  I've managed to put every app I need including Adobe Photoshop Express and Amazon Kindle. The only problem I have encountered was installing Skype, it starts but does not work.\nOne thing missing compared to galaxy is the absence of the microSD card slot, but I've managed to bypass it with Eye-fi sd card in my camera and it works seamlessly.\nAt the moment it's the best tablet I own and owned, better than nooks, kindle fire, galaxy tabs, touchpads and ipads. I still find galaxy tab the best hardware design wise, but it seems like UI and great screen make the difference for me.\nPS looking forward to the BlackBerry new smartphone. It's sad that the best products are not always commercially successful as well"}

While some people feel that it is the best thing ever and some hate it, let me just point out that not everyone received the same quality tablet. Blackberry had sent out many defective ones thus the dramatic drop in price. Some people had no problems, but me and others have had to send ours back to blackberry for various reasons. There's that stupid problem with the power button. I don't care if a tablet has the most cutting edge features and can take you to the moon and back. What good is it if the most basic part of it, the power button, malfunctions? Oh, that's besides the endless battery problems. When the battery dies, the tablet needs to spend 10,000 years on the charger before even turning on even though it is plugged in. As for apps, there are not that many to choose from. You can basically get more use out of a good smartphone than this tablet. I feel that most of the people that reviewed it positively are either blackberry fiends or blackberry employees but I could be wrong. Don't be lured in by the cheap price of this tablet, it is still a waste of money."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "The Blackberry Playbook is quite an interesting tablet. It brings to the table what you would normally expect out of a 7in tablet. It comes equipped with a 7 inch, 1024x600 display, which still looks pretty nice despite the lower resolution compared to other tablets on the market. The Playbook also has a rear 5MP camera, capable of 1080p video, and a front facing 3MP camera for thing like video chat. In our tests, we the still picture image quality to be a bit sub-par compared to other devices, however the 1080p video was rather nice for the camera thats given.  Moving on to software, the Playbook comes with version 2 of RIM's QNX software, which we found to be a rather pleasant experience. The navigation of the OS is based around its multitasking features, which keeps all open apps in its own little box on the home screen, which are all constantly running. For that matter, the Playbook really shines at multitasking compared to other mobile OSs, however thats really where its pluses end. The Playbook's app store, called Blackberry App World, really lacks in apps, even with developers able to convert their Android apps to Blackberry. We really hope to see more developer support for the Playbook."}

Unfortunately it was locked in demo mode so I had to exchange it,\nbut they didn't have any left in stock.\n\nOne very important thing I want to say is that don't think the tablet is dead if it doesn't turn on when you get.\nI thought mine was dead at first, but apparently the software doesn't let it turn on if the battery is drained\nto less than 10 or 20%. It takes about 2 hours to charge it to get it to 20%. Some people have also said that\nthe battery dies when you drain it completely... that's because lithium ion batteries aren't like alkaline\nbatteries and it's not good to completely discharge them.\n\nPROS\nThis is using original operating system version 1.0.7 Bundle 2942 that came with it, not even\nthe latest 2.0.1 Bundle 358 update.\n\n-Comes with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint preinstalled. I'm not sure how useful this would be for professionals\nsince the tablet doesn't have 3G, but if you have a Blackberry phone and use the bridge, it seems like it could be very useful.\n-Browser has only crashed twice using it for about 3 hours a day for 10 days. Not bad at all. Once it crashes\nyou can turn it back on immediately.\n-I easily had 5 tabs open in the browser, 2 of them videos but didn't try more. The 1Gb of ram helps a lot with multitasking.\n-Amazing Wifi: Browser confirmed download speed of 100 KBPS compared to 80KBPS on both desktops and a laptop which\nI thought was pretty strange. The browser must have have a built in download accelerator or something\nbut I'm pretty sure my internet shouldn't go faster than 80kbps. I always have full connection.\n- 3.5-4 minutes/1% battery when watching videos, 5.5-6 minutes/1% when\nbrowsing/listening to music, apparently 4- 4.2 minutes if just reading and brightness at 50%\nThe brightness at 10-30% is more than enough. When I set it to 100% it literally hurts my eyes it's so bright.\n\n-OS 2.0 apparently lets you download a lot of android apps.\n-Amazing screen, some things look like they're 3-d. More than sufficient brightness, super black blacks,\nno dead pixels,very even brightness. The resolution is also very good, both text and video are super crisp.\n-Great touchscreen responsiveness, pinch to zoom features, and hold a link to right click.\n-Very stiff case, it's very hard to twist\n-Thin and light, doesn't get hot, not more than 90 to 100 Fahrenheit\n-The keyboard is amazing, and the size of the tablets lets me type with both fingers even in landscape mode,\nalthough that wouldn't be comfortable for a long period of time\n-True multitasking with the UNIX based Blackberry OS, unlike IOS and other operating systems.\nYou can leave the camera on, a game on in the background, music on, all while browsing the internet.\n-Good weight, feels solid but not too heavy at all\n-Can bridge with Blackberry smart phones (I haven't used this feature).\n-Pretty decent speakers, can get pretty loud.\n\nCONS\n-Biggest con for me is that the Blackberry desktop software just doesn't work. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling at least 5 times,\nbut it never downloads over 60%. If you try to upload on the tablet directly it also cuts off, saying the internet connection\nmight have been interrupted but it hadn't been. Most download managers would automatically pause if the wifi got disconnected,\nnot start completely over again. Very annoying.\n-Takes 3-5 seconds to switch from portrait to landscape mode once you rotate it, not a big deal for me though\n-Takes 60 to 80 seconds (average 65) to turn on if off for more than 30 minutes. The good thing\nis it's functional immediately after it turns on.\n-15 increments of volume adjustment, but I always felt like it was too quiet or too loud (with headphones on) I have very sensitive ears though.\n-Most camera pics look grainy, white light pics look much less grainy though. When you upload the pics to your computer\nthere'll be a lot of pixels, but a lot of them are just noise.\n-When the battery is charged to 90 to 95% capacity it takes a very long time to charge to 100- about 1 hour from 90 to 100\nOnce above 20% it takes 3 to 4 hours to fully charge. 2 hours from 0-20%\n-Only 13.4 GBs of usable space, but my whole music collection is about 5 GBs and I don't plan on putting a lot of movies on the tablet.\n-Can't expand memory because of no SD card slot.\n\nOverall, for me, the pros dramatically outweigh the cons.\nThis is the review that convinced me to buy this: check out the review on notebookcheck dot net\nI pretty much agree with everything stated here.\n\nOne tip I have is to charge the battery to around 95% and only let it drain to 70%. This maximizes the life of the battery. For me, this gave about\n2 to 3 hours of time between charges.

The screen resolution is amazing and everything is so fine and beautiful.

Also the battery charger was missing so i couldn't even turn it on. I had to end up returning everything and purchase a new one from my local office depot. So before you buy it online make sure you're buying it from a legit and well trusted distributor (like amazon directly).

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "3 weeks in and I'm ready to put a review out.\n\nI bought the playbook because I really wanted an introductory tablet (price wise). I own the Bold 9930 and from what I could tell, the playbook was going to extremely complimentary.\n\nPros:\n* The small and compact design is great as a travel companion.\n* I own the 32GB playbook, which I've found to keep a great deal of music and info. I routinely use it as an external hard drive and copy files from my desktop to keep with me while I'm on the go.\n* Having the docs to go app has been great. Although they are not the full versions, they provide enough firepower to get the job done.\n* The bridge application serves as security for the playbook. Other Wi-Fi only tablets require email account set up. For instance, you set up Gmail and whenever you connect to a Wi-Fi network your email is refreshed and calendars and contacts will reflect the latest changes. With the playbook, if you have a blackberry phone, you simplify bridge the two devices and you have instant access to everything on you phone. My phone has all emails, contacts and calendars so there is no need to duplicate efforts.\n* Now the playbook has access to many of the popular android apps. Because I'm not terribly interested in every app, the ones of necessity were readily available to side load on my playbook.\n* Using my bold as a remote control. I find that typing on the actual phone is a bit faster than typing on the notebook itself. To each his/her own, but when you've been busing a blackberry for a long time, you find that typing on it is second nature. I'm sure I'll come around to typing on the actual playbook for smaller tasks.\n* Being able to expand the memory of the PB by increasing the memory SD card in my phone. Since you can access your phones SD card, you can literally have 32GB on the phone and 32GB onboard the PB. The capabilities become vast with that amount of storage space available to use, and this is on the go too.\n* Using the \"view on my PB\" feature. How many times do you find a site that you wish you could view on a larger screen?  With this option, you can always utilize the PB full Internet browser to view anything of interest that you first received on your phone.\n\nCons\n* Since the apps primarily come from the android platform, there isn't always seamless compatibility. For instance, dropbox will not all uploading from files stored on the playbook.\n* Music - this is a bit of a personal beef, but with all the music I have on my phone, I'd love to just make a playlist on my PB using the music from my phone. Currently, you can only access one song at a time from your phone to your PB.\n* Can only open one type of docs to go document at one time. For instance, you can only open one excel file at a time. You can have more than 1 excel file open. If you open a 2nd file, it will close your first. Wish you could have multiple excel files open at once.\n* Bridge destroys the battery life of the phone when using the tethering option. I guess you can't have it all.\n* Video store could stand to be updated.\n\nAll in all, the PB does what every other tablet does. It hasta fast processor, front and rear camera with enough megapixels to take great shots, a video recorder, The ability to watch movies and listen to music, and has a great internet browser with flash.  I understand the beef that the app store is lacking. If you're into apps, and the apps your looking for can't be side loaded, then your right, this may not be the tablet for you. But if your looking for a tablet that has a fundamental ability to make you more productive, allows you to kill some time with movies and a few games, let's you read e-books and has the option to expand the storage space (via owning a blackberry phone) for an affordable price; I guess I don't know where you can wrong. Like other tablets, if you own the tablet makers phone, you'll be able to take advantage of a few more bells and whistles. No doubt having a blackberry makes this tablet more viable. Don't fall for the hype that there are no apps. And don't fall for the hype that this isn't a powerful tablet. I think for your first tablet, this is the way to go. You learn what you like and what you would like to change without breaking the bank. I think you will be pleasantly surprised with how useful this tablet can be when you put it to task."}

The QNX OS employs more touch commands and one has to be more aware of this at first but just a few days of constant use will make the user feel at ease as the experience is retained in memory.\n\nOne should experience the ability to record video at high definition, the screen is just the right size and brightness that allows the viewing of the scenes in real time. Playback is equally as impressive and video files can be easily exported as attachments to e-mail and sent via wi-fi.\n\nThough not heavily advertized, the Playbook is capable of communicating in two different frequencies because of its built-in dual band wifi hardware. I was pleasantly surprised to find this out the first time the tablet was turned on for its initial setup. The newer 5ghz band is faster and ideal for media streaming from a wireless network server or storage.\n\nApplications are still scarce but new ones are starting to appear and participation of new users could encourage the development and porting of additional softwares. However, it must be emphasized that the Playbook comes with a set of applications that makes the tablet useful as a productivity tool and with the addition of applications  that provide gps navigation, internet access, wireless file management and media playback, the need for additional programs such as games and entertainment becomes secondary."}

I loved the ease at which you could use it plus the blackberry bridge. The only thing that i didn't like was the fact that i needed a wifi connection before i could use the tablet. Other than that i think the playbook is simply awesome."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I like the Blackberry PlayBook tablet very much (I have three of them) and overall, my experience with it has been stellar except for a hiccup at the beginning. More on that later. There are several great tablets in the market and I place the PlayBook among them. I think the PlayBook is the most under-rated tablet in the market today and for consumers, that is a good thing. They are inexpensive now and are an exceptional value for your money.\n\nThe PlayBook is still the first generation PlayBook (I do not consider the 4G model second generation). Yet, its hardware and software are still as relevant and stands up to the new generations of the major tablets in the market. In other words, while the hot-selling tablets have released new models and are in their second or third generation, the major capabilities and features of the PlayBook have not been surpassed by them, such as dual HD cameras, front-facing stereo speakers, etc. The initial major problem with the PlayBook, i.e. no native email,  has been resolved.\n\nAnyway, here's why I like the PlayBook:\n\n1. True Portability- the 7-inch screen size is great. The unit is small enough to fit inside most of my jackets' pockets.\n\n2. Unobtrusive- it is not much bigger than some of the 5-inch smartphones and you can pull it out in public, like at a restaurant without being obtrusive.\n\n3. Cheap! - You can get the 64GB model for as low as $199.99 (recent Office Depot sale). It may even get lower during the year-end holiday sales.\n\n4. Promise of Things to Come - When the BB10 phone is introduced early next year, PlayBook owners can expect a major software upgrade that will have very promising capabilities and features. It's like getting a new tablet for free! BB10 may be revolutionary.\n\n5. Great Stereo Sound - the speakers are dual front-facing speakers for optimal sound.\n\n6. Easy Connection to TV - the micro-HDMI slot makes it so easy to connect it to my TV so I can watch movies, etc. up to full 1080p on the bigscreen. Believe it or not, I bought a 6-foot HDMI to micro-HDMI cable online for only a dime! With shipping, it came to about a dollar. I have since bought a 15-foot cable for a really good price online, so I do not have to get off the couch.\n\n7. Cheap Optional Rapid Charger - Since no one seems to want the PlayBook, I have been lucky to find PlayBook accessories such as the Rapid Charging Stand, Rapid Travel Charger and leather cases at clearance prices. Each of the rapid chargers can charge the PlayBook at least twice as fast as the standard charger which came with the PlayBook. I timed it and was able to charge it from 0% to 100% in 2 hours and 50 minutes. By the way, some users have stated that if their PlayBooks drained down to 0% battery charge, they could not recharge it until they found a solution to this problem online. When my PlayBook drained down to 0%, I immediately plugged in the rapid charger and took the opportunity to see how long it would take to fully recharge. In my situation, I did not experience any problem charging at all. Perhaps if I left it at 0% considerably longer, I might not have been able to charge it. That, I will not know because I do not intend to let it drain to 0% again. Incidentally, the PlayBook gives an audible and visual warning when battery level is down to 9%. In my experience above, I dismissed the warning and continued working until it suddenly shut down by itself, indicating that battery level was at 0%!  That was when I immediately plugged in the rapid charger and I was up to 100% again in two hours and 50 minutes.\n\nThese rapid chargers use the magnetic port (the one on the right with three metallic \"dots\") instead of the micro-USB port for charging, thus saving wear and tear on the micro-USB port, which has been reported by some owners as having fallen apart after some use, rendering them unable to charge the PlayBook unless they bought one of the two optional rapid chargers. Incidentally, I used the micro-USB port to charge using the standard charger for more than six months (before I got my rapid chargers) and I do not see any damage on the micro-USB port. I always made sure the cable was not putting any stress (weight) on the port. I think those who reported damaged micro-USB ports were not careful and put stress on the port. Likewise, I am also careful when using the micro-HDMI port to make sure the port is not unduly stressed to minimize wear and tear or damage. The HDMI cable can be heavy, relative to the port, so make sure the cable is supported and no weight stress is put on the port.\n\n8. Dual Cameras - one in the front and one in the back, both high-definition (shoots 1080p video).\n\n9. Great User-Interface - I like the swiping gestures and the multi-tasking capabilities. It is fast and smooth. I did not notice any lag when multi-tasking and having several applications open at the same time.  Web-browsing was great, and felt like I was at my computer with the full web experience, except with a 7-inch screen. Thanks to Flash and HTML support.\n\n10. Good Battery Life - Battery life depends on what you are using it for and can vary very much. I find that I can get at least five continuous hours under heavy use, such as constant web-browsing or watching movies. When listening to Slacker radio (where the screen turns dark while the music plays), I measured the rate of battery drain at 6% drain for the first two hours of use. I kept the radio playing for an additional two hours and it showed a drain of 12% over four hours. Thus, it appears the drain is quite constant. If we extrapolate, then on a full charge, one can potentially listen to Slacker radio continuously for 33.2 hours before the battery is depleted.  The volume throughout my test was not at minimum, but at approximately 75% of maximum. So, the battery can last from 5 to 33 hours, depending on use. 33 hours is a lot more than even the \"up to 10 hours\" stated in the literature for the product. Some may not be happy with the 5-hour minimum, but I am plenty pleased. That's more than three average length movies of 90 minutes each.\n\nAdditionally, I measured battery drain while it was put in \"standby\" mode, with wifi and bluetooth off. Standby mode avoids the almost three-minute boot-up from complete power off. By the way, the long boot-up time is a security measure of the PlayBook. It checks everything to make sure your tablet is secure.  When in standby mode, just swipe from the top downward and it wakes up the PlayBook. You're ready to go instantaneously. I did not use my three PlayBooks for more than a day to conduct this test. They were left in constant standby,  other than when I checked battery levels. Two of them started with 100% battery charge and the third one had 65% battery charge at the commencement of the test. Let's call them A, B and C, with C being the 65% one.  After 19 hours, A had 93% battery charge left. After 24.5 hours, it had 91% left. After 24 hours, B had 92% battery charge left. After 36 hours, it had 88% left. After 12 hours, C had 58% charge left and after 26.5 hours, it had 55% left. I started the tests at different times and checked battery levels at different times. That is why I cannot give the same interval information for all three tests. But you can clearly see that the \"standby\" mode does not drain the battery rapidly. You can leave it for days on standby mode and still have significant battery power when you need it.\n\n11. Blackberry Bridge - I have a Blackberry phone. If I do not have wifi service for the PlayBook, I can use my phone's data plan. I bridge the PlayBook to the phone and can access the internet. No additional charge from the phone company since I have an unlimited data plan. No need to get the 4G PlayBook and no monthly data plan.\n\n12. Screen display is very clear even if it is not full 1080p. It really does not matter when the screen is only 7 inches that it is not full 1080p. I do not think anyone can tell the difference when the screen is only 7 inches. If you connect the PlayBook to your 1080p bigscreen TV, it is capable of displaying 1080p video, and the cameras can shoot 1080p video.\n\nAt the start of this review, I stated there was a hiccup early on in my experience with the PlayBook. Hic... here it is. Within a couple of days after doing the initial set-up with my first PlayBook in November 2011, I tried to change the volume on the PlayBook but was not able to do so. I called up Blackberry customer service (\"CS\") and explained my situation. I explicitly told CS how I was depressing the volume control keys to try to change the volume and asked if I was doing it right. I was told I was doing it right and since it was not working, CS subsequently wrote me up a repair order and sent me the box and documents to send the unit to their repair center. While we were on the telephone though, CS sent me an email to have me agree to the terms of their repair service. I agreed by emailing them a response to their email, though I told CS I did not read the agreement. After all, it was clear if I did not agree to their agreement, I would not be able to send the unit in for repair.\n\nAfter I responded to their email, I had a heated discussion with CS because they said that if the unit could not be repaired, they would send me a replacement unit. I asked if the replacement would be new and CS indicated it would not be new but a refurbished unit. I explained my unit was brand new and just opened two days prior to the call and demanded that if my unit was not repairable, that I be sent a new unit. CS remained steadfast in their position that only a refurbished unit would be sent. I was very disappointed with Blackberry/RIM at this point.\n\nAnyway, when I got my unit back, I checked and was relieved to see that it was my original unit and not a refurbished one. But when I checked the volume keys, I was shocked that they still did not work! I was too angry at this point to call up CS again. Since everything else worked, I just calmed down and used the PlayBook and got to learn its features and thought I would call CS later. I liked the product, but was highly disappointed the volume keys still did not work.\n\nAfter a few days, I played around with the volume keys again and after some attempts, lo and behold, they worked. I then determined what I had done differently and repeated it and it worked again. It turned out that you cannot depress a volume key and hold it to change the volume. You have to depress it and let go immediately. Then the volume bar appears in the middle of the screen and then you depress a volume key again (and let go immediately) to raise or lower the volume. So it just turned out that I was doing it wrong and the repair was probably not even necessary because it was not defective. CS was not able to tell me that I was not doing it right when I explained how I was trying to use the volume keys when I called the first time!\n\nOne good thing did come out of that repair job though. The power button was flush with the top panel making it a little difficult to depress the button. While I did not complain about it, I noticed when I got the unit back that the button was no longer flush with the top panel but protruded a little, making it a lot easier to depress the button. They fixed it without my asking for it to be done.\n\nThis incident though, is a big negative for Blackberry/RIM because I would have been a very disappointed customer if my unit had a real problem which was not repairable and I was given a refurbished unit as a replacement. No one likes his or her brand new product to be replaced by a used unit when it has barely been used a couple of days! Moreover, sales of the PlayBook were so poor and the company had excess inventory. I was appalled they could not keep a customer happy by promising a customer a new unit if the unit was not repairable. I would not have expected a new unit if I had used it for more than say, thirty days. But two days? Come on, RIM!\n\nI have had occasion to call CS several more times for various other issues, none of which were major. While I have spoken to one or two CS representatives who were knowledgeable about the product, my sense is that more than a few of the CS representatives are not very knowledgeable about the product. They frequently put me on hold while they consulted other personnel about my problem or reviewed a manual. I have noticed this more since about April this year when I had to call in after I got my second and then my third PlayBook. I wonder if in the process of cutting back staff at RIM, they let the more knowledgeable and longer tenured (thus presumably higher-earning) CS representatives go and kept the newer and less knowledgeable staff. I have had occasion to spend about an hour and a half on the phone with CS and yet not be able to get a solution to my problem. Fortunately, I use a speaker phone when I call so I am not that ticked off at the holds that I have to endure as I am able to do other things while I wait.\n\nI strongly suggest that if you have a problem with the PlayBook that you do some research and try to find a solution first before you call CS. Crackberry.com has very informative and helpful forums. Amazon reviewers also offer some very helpful tips and solutions. I also hope RIM will conduct more training and educational sessions for their CS staff to make sure they are familiar with the product. While at this time I cannot give a glowing account of customer support, I must say that the CS representatives were polite and they did try hard to help. I would say they have helped with 80% of my issues. As to the other 20%, I was able to find solutions online myself. Perhaps CS could have helped with them eventually, but I guess I got a little tired and impatient after being on the telephone so long that I told them I would try to resolve it myself and if I was not able to, I would just call them again.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend the Blackberry PlayBook. You get a lot for your money at current prices and it performs very strongly and impressively. Most negative information circulating about the PlayBook was due, in my opinion, to its premature release in April 2011. At that time, it was somewhat of a \"half-baked\" product. That is no longer the case, thanks to software updates, but I see many in the industry, including professional reviewers, continue to bash and denigrate the PlayBook. I suspect some do that because they are beholden to RIM's competitors. RIM is not blameless, as I hardly see any marketing done for its products. It keeps getting hit and insulted but just does not seem to want to fight back. It seems it is only layperson reviewers who sing the praises for the PlayBook while RIM itself just sucks up the punches.\n\nI stand by the PlayBook, but a word of caution - if you must have a zillion apps for your tablet, Skype and Netflix, then look elsewhere. The small number of available apps compared to the numerous apps for the hot-selling tablets do not bother me. As it is, other than a few I use regularly, I hardly use the hundred or so apps I have downloaded onto my PlayBooks. PlayBook owners are still hoping Skype and Netflix will be available in the near future, but I am not holding my breath. I believe that it is not that the PlayBook is incapable of operating Skype and Netflix, but that it is Skype and Netflix that have not released apps for their services for the PlayBook. If I am mistaken, please correct me. Skype is owned by Microsoft, and Netflix may be beholden to the hottest seller in the market. I believe there may be competitive reasons for depriving the PlayBook of these two services. It just goes to show how formidable a tablet the PlayBook really is, and competitors know it. Imagine what it might be with Skype and Netflix."}

On the other hand there is an update that you will be asked to download which is like 350mb when you first boot up and set up the device which will allow you to play many of the android apps on your tablet after you install it and I also heard that soon it will fully support android apps as well as android market. So what is great about this playbook is that it is very fast, price is great, long battery life, high quality speakers, good wifi signal, it has everything you want and need from a good tablet, and it also replaces other more expensive tablets such as Samsung galaxy tab and ipad."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I bought a Toshiba Thrive 10\" and a Blackberry PlayBook 16 gig tablets.  I also have a generic 7\" android tablet for comparison.  The BBPB is really nice.  The interface, the response, the touch and feel, are superior to the android tablets.  It makes deleting apps and updating apps so much easier.  The Ice Cream Sandwich on the android tablets is ok, not sure what the big deal is about, it's still a bit cumbersome to get around.  The BBPB is much smoother and nimble, especially when it comes to web browsing.  I tried 3 different browsers on the android tablets and they crash quite often whereas the BBPB gives me much more confidence in its stability.  I thought after the past few years with the smart phones and tablets that Android tablets would be stable, but with so many different hardware variations, it's still a bit of a Wild Wild West - It's akin to Windows XP versus Windows 7 on a PC.  The only drawback to the BBPB is the apps that are available.  It's still a bit thin and I do not think BB will introduce a Android run-time environment so that you can run android apps on your Playbook (even though they said they would oh so long ago).  On a positive note, you can side-load 1/3 of the android apps on your BBPB.  You can look that up.  Finally, the BBPB just feels like a serious piece of hardware.  Plus, you can get what was recently a $400 tablet for about $150 now.  Not too shabby.  Hope this helps."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "This should be better then on the BB forums where raving fan boys despise anything realistic but negative about BB in general. I took the PB to Colorado to use the mapping function at the B&B as we went sightseeing. That was a fail, browser was very slow and the WiFi was upstairs at the B&B&. Left it on night stand for a week or so and now I'm restoring the PB by doing a OS reinstall. SO far It loaded on the 12 or 14th attempt. Tonight after charging for three days the browser froze as usual and I tried a reboot and will not proceed beyond the initial script where it says Play Book.\n\nI will now do a OS reinstall again. Once it is up and running it will go up for sale! I have no blind loyalty to any piece of plastic inanimate object like so many in the forums. It needs to work as advertised with minimal effort or my money goes elsewhere. Be it a truck, clothes phone etc. RIMM has lost 97% market value for all the reason already posted.\n\nI'm just sharing that this product is mediocrity at its finest and will join my old Torch 9800. My one year old 'new Atrix2' is what the Torch should have been in format and functionality. But here we are. Soon I will be a former BB user of 6 years and will no longer hold out that the \"NEXT ONE\" will be the fix. Good luck to the blind loyal owners. Hope it works out really do I do not want to see RIMM fail but such are businesses and it part of the cycle.\n\nThis Play Book was working ok for the most part until the battery went dead. A known issue as many manufacturers do they gamble that is is cheaper to fix one by one then a massive recall or acknowledge a problem and provide a fix. In this case it hurt RIMM.\n\nI would not recommend a PB for any price to anyone. I will be looking to see what the 10\" Android models offer; and move on from there. Do they have issues sure just read the forums. Will you spend three days reloading the OS to see if it works after two hours per episode for the set up drill? Maybe not. I do have to perform a battery pull on my Atrix on occasion, but not anywhere near the frequency of the Torch 9800. Anyway, hope this helps Please read the BB forums before you  buy one, but do not take my word alone as a dissatisfied owner. Look and research some more and see for your self."}

I'm really disappointed with the fact that it can't interface to my computer to download contacts, calander and tasks (business type applications).  It plays games fairly well and I'm still learning about some of the other applications it does, but thinking that I'd be able to use it for work (which I thought Blackberry was oriented for), i can't.  I've heard rumor that it will eventually do these things, but I don't understand why Blackberry didn't do it right the first time.  I'm thinking about selling it on e-bay and getting something else that I can use for work.  Here's a scenerio for you....  I travel a lot.  Without the ability to transfer and maintain contacts in the playbook from my Outlook account, preparing emails on the airplane is OK as long as you know the individuals email address.  Tasks can be created using the playbook, but they won't transfer to outlook.  I surely don't want to keep two task lists and two sets of contacts.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Its a shame to see Research In Motion's lack of innovation in support, marketing & advertising, and business dominance cause the company to take a backseat to other phone and tablet companies. At one point RIM was on top of the world. Everyone had a BlackBerry. They were a great company with a fantastic and functional smartphone. The trackball was cool. Brickbreaker and BBM were all the rage. Now, they are a company that's lost 80% of its value, has continued to see declining sales in the US and worldwide, and it rapidly losing its kung-fu grip on the business enterprise consumer. Its a shame. But this is what happens when a company fails to adapt to change, fails to recognize the threat of competition, and fails to innovate and keep its once loyal consumer base happy. That all being said, the PlayBook is a near Home Run. But likely few will be left to realize it.  Enough with my RIM rant, on to the device.\n\nAs for the PlayBook, if you are looking for a 7\" ultra-portable tablet that has bulletproof construction, an incredibly simple and user friendly interface and OS yet CPU-like accessibility, fantastic web browsing with Flash support, and the added ability to Bridge up to your BlackBerry smartphone for a fraction of what other tablets cost...then the PlayBook is the tablet for you.\n\nPROS:\nBy now I think a good number of people out there have or at least know the basic benefits and functions of what tablets can do. I will only go over the Pros and Cons that set the BlackBerry PlayBook apart from the competition.\n\n-Size: you are either a 7\" tablet person or a 10\" tablet person. At first I told myself I would wait for RIM to release a bigger version. After the realization that could be years (and doesn't look like its going to happen until late 2013 or 2014 if at all) I decided to buy the 16gig PB. I fell in love with the size. Small enough to fit in just about any bag comfortable, use inconspicuously, and hold and type smoothly using both thumbs when holding in hand.  Size is going to be a personal preference in the end but I think the 7\" size is a pro in my book.\n\n-Web Browsing: Hands down the best out there. Full Flash enabled websites make internet surfing almost identical to being on a desktop/laptop. Bill paying, media playing, online shopping, or just surfing is incredible. This is probably the main reason I bought one in the beginning. I almost never go anywhere in my house without my PlayBook because of this. At the dinner table and realize you need to pay that credit card bill (assuming you aren't stuck in the stone age and paying by check)...no problem. Want to quickly change your Fantasy Football team and watch that video snip about the latest injury report while watching the game...no problem. Reading outside on your deck and come across a word you don't recognize and want to lookup...no problem. No longer do you have to wait an hour and a half for the laptop to boot up.\n\n-Freedom from Ecosystem: some may consider this a downfall but I see it as a major positive. BlackBerry doesn't force you to become part of their ecosystem. There is no iTunes that is forcing you to use their system to download songs in a weird, unlockable format that may cause issues for other non-Apple devices. Loading songs or documents onto the device is and has always been as simple as plug the device in and drag-and-drop what you want to the folder on the device just like an external storage device. The charger slot is a mini-USB. The HDMI slot is a mini-HDMI. There are no $100 Apple-to-USB or HDMI adapters required. Its the $3 universal adapter on Amazon. If you want to use Amazon's Cloud player for your streaming music, you can...unlike Apple.\n\n-Guts and Multi-Tasking: without boring the non-techie geeks out there, the guts and OS of this tablet are phenomenal. I will just say that the processing speed, ability to multi-task between applications, screen clarity and resolution are top-notch. I have never once had a complaint about speed or the tablet functioning slow. And right now my 16gig is almost completely full with music and files. The OS which will soon be coming in an adapted version to BB's new phones in 2013 as BB10 is an OS-killer in my opinion. Its their last chance but all early indications is that they nailed it. The PB has the ability to multi-task between multiple applications unlike any other tablet. Think about having the ability of swiping between the video player, Internet Browser, Map, Weather app, Game app, an Excel spreadsheet, Calendar, PDF file, and Slacker Radio app all at once with each app running in the background and not causing a slowdown to processing. Incredible. Makes doing multiple functions at once on the PB a breeze.\n\n-BB Bridge: this is a bonus Pro for those with BB phones. The ability to Bridge the phone to the PlayBook over bluetooth is really cool. You can access all files through the PB and also add/delete/change things in the contacts, calendar, memos, and tasks on the phone.  So if you are in an airplane and want a bigger screen to work in your calendar for example, its a nifty function.  You can also use your phone's internet connection to tether to the PB to allow internet when outside of a wi-fi zone. Another big bonus since there isn't a 3g/4g version of the PlayBook in the states. (They just launched a 4G/LTE in Canada)\n\nCONS:\n-Lack of App Support: this is lone elephant in the room and its a big one. BlackBerry just doesn't offer the apps on the PlayBook that are available on Droid or Apple. It has gotten much better and there have constantly been talks of bringing Droid apps into the system but I'm still holding my breath. This is shocking also because some of the \"no-brainer\" apps are not available on PB. No Pandora app...really?  Ok so use Slacker Radio...it is basically the same thing. No Bloomberg app...really?  As someone in financial services I use that one everyday on my phone. Now granted, the PlayBook's internet experience is so spot on that many apps are unnecessary but that's not an excuse. Sure I can go to full website but sometimes I want the App only.\n\n-Lack of Sales and adoption: this isn't a huge con but its worth pointing out. Because of the lack of app support above and a variety of other reasons, there aren't very many PlayBooks floating around out there in circulation. I remember the 2nd quarter the PlayBook was available they SHIPPED less than 250,000 of them to retailers like Best Buy when Apple's iPad SOLD 12 million that same quarter.  This means good luck trying to use some of the apps that are for PlayBook only. Video Chat...I bet it works great since there are two high quality camera eyes on both sides of the device but I will never know because I'm the only person I know on the planet who owns one. (truth be told, I actually did see someone walk by me in the airport with one...only time I have ever seen another one and I thought I should have said something or went to high five the random stranger as weird as that sounds.  That's how \"un-trendy\" they are and how few are out there.)\n\nBottom line is the PlayBook is a near home run. If they had more sales success and adoption from the consumer base therefore having the app support, this device would be as perfect as any tablet could be right now. They could nail it on their next one but that's an uphill battle. For now, I am sticking with my PB and actually just bought my 2nd one. My 16gig I bought 6 months ago will go to a family member and I am keeping the 64gig for myself. I liked the tablet at full launch price but I love it at half off. It is basically a steal. I just hope RIM as a company is still around in the next few years so they don't stop supporting the device, I don't know if I can live without it."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Pros:\n\n1 - The BlackBerry packaging was nice and professional.\n2 - Tablet looks brand new w/ no scratches or blemishes\n3 - Price on a refurbished unit is so low I had to give the Playbook a try.\n4 - No capacitive buttons to accidentally press during operation.\n5 - While you don't need to own a BlackBerry Smartphone to go out and buy a BlackBerry PlayBook tablet, if you do own both BlackBerry phone and tablet you can take advantage of the BlackBerry Bridge, which connects your tablet to your phone, allowing your tablet to act like a big touchscreen for your phone providing direct access to your phone's email, calendars, BBM files and other data.\n\nCons:\n\n1 - Doesn't work\n2 - Battery won't charge (even with the official micro USB wall charger from BlackBerry)\n3 - No expandable memory\n4 - Limited apps available on BlackBerry App World\n5 - Side loading Android apps (convert APK to BAR) is unreliable.  Some apps still won't work properly.\n6 - Very small power button\n7 - Must use official BlackBerry PlayBook charger.  Other micro USB chargers won't work, effectively making this a proprietary device.\n\nI saw this BlackBerry PlayBook on sale for $129.99 for a refurbished 16GB unit on another site.  I had passed on this tablet when it was released because it was so expensive and the were very little apps available for it.  This low price made me change my mind.  So I went ahead an ordered it and just got it in the mail yesterday.\n\nThe tablet feels very sturdy.  This is not a flimsy, plastic frame on this tablet.  It's all black and actually looks very nice and professional.\n\nI plugged this refurbished unit in and it won't charge.  When I plug in the wall charger, the indicator light turns red for about 10-15 seconds on followed by 5 blinking green lights. Then the light just turns off and nothing happens.  I've tried the different tips like doing a \"stacked charge\" (2 minutes plugged in / 2 minutes off done six times) , but the PlayBook still won't charge.  I tried doing a hard reset by holding down the power / volume buttons, but the PlayBook still won't charge.\n\nI left my BlackBerry PlayBook plugged in overnight to see if that would help.  It was on the official BlackBerry USB wall charger that came with the unit for SEVEN HOURS.  I got up this morning and tried to turn it on but it still won't work.\n\nI Googled \"BlackBerry PlayBook won't charge\" and found that this is a well documented problem on several websites and forums.  BEFORE you decide to buy one of these, check it out.  The prices on these 16GB BlackBerry PlayBooks are getting cheaper, so it may be worth the chance.\n\nI'm sending this refurbished BlackBerry PlayBook back as a RMA. If I had known that this tablet wouldn't work out of the box without having to go through all of this hassle just to get the battery to work, I wouldn't have bought it.  Now I know there are some BlackBerry fans who really love the PlayBook, but charging a device, no matter if it's a tablet, cellphone, MP3 player or laptop should be EASY.  Just plug it in and it should work.  I have bought a lot of electric devices over the years.  I even have cheap MP4 players that have been sitting around for months and I can pull them out, plug them in and they work without a problem.\n\nI think that it's absolutely pathetic that RIM sold a product to consumers that The battery won't charge if it gets too low.  It's bad enough that you don't have access to all of the available Android apps on Play Store, but this is even worse.  I bought this tablet knowing that BlackBerry's App World only has a limited about of apps available.  While less functional than other 7\" tablets, at the bare minimum I expected to use the BlackBerry PlayBook as a ereader, web browser and PMP.  I was planning to go to goodreader.com and try to get a few Android apps missing from BlackBerry's App World like Nook, Aldiko, iReader, Audible, MoboPlayer, PlayerPro, Empire Defense 2 and Myth Defense.  I also know that side loading apps is pretty much a hit or miss proposition because even if you convert a APK file to a BAR file, there's still no guarantee it will work properly.  But at such a low price, I thought I'd get by until a better Android tablet hit the market.  But I had no idea that there was this problem with the battery.  The last thing I expected was to not even be able to turn it on.\n\nRIM did post up a couple of knowledge base article detailing the low battery state of the BlackBerry PlayBook. RIM tells us that:\n******\n\nWhen the battery level of the BlackBerry PlayBook reaches a level 0%, the tablet will automatically turn off.  The LED will blink in a sequence when attempting to Power On the device indicating a low charge, red blink and then followed by 5 yellow blinks.\n\nThis is because the BlackBerry PlayBook battery does not have enough charge to power up the tablet.\n\nIt is recommended to connect the BlackBerry PlayBook to the Rapid Wall Charger that came with your BlackBerry PlayBook, or one of the charging accessories listed:\n\nBlackBerry PlayBook Rapid Charging Pod\nBlackBerry Rapid Travel Charger\nBlackBerry Premium Charger\n\nPlease leave BlackBerry PlayBook plugged in for about 40 minutes or until full charge is achieved.  Connecting to a PC to charge via USB will not be sufficient to charge the tablet.\n\n******\n\nRIM is obviously aware of this issue with the battery. Instead, RIM made the calculated business decision to NOT fix the batteries in the BlackBerry Playbook devices that they are manufacturing. Apparently it's cheaper to just tell consumers to go through overly convoluted steps like doing a \"stacked charge\". Seriously, this is where you have to press buttons, plug it in and unplug it for 2 minute intervals for half a dozen times and hope the battery will start working.  The frustrating thing is doing this \"stacked charge\" takes almost a half hour of plugging and unplugging.  I've never owned a electronic device where somebody may have to spend half a hour just trying to get the battery to work.\n\nHere's another article from their knowledge base:\n\n********\nKB26808 - The BlackBerry PlayBook tablet is unable to charge when powered off\n\nOverview\n\nThe BlackBerry PlayBook(tm) tablet requires software control in order to charge. This means the BlackBerry PlayBook must be powered on in order for the battery level to increase.\n\nIf the BlackBerry PlayBook is plugged into a power source while powered off it will automatically power on in order to accept the charge.\nIf the BlackBerry PlayBook is powered off while plugged into a charging source it will not continue to charge.\n\n[...]\n\nNote: If the battery level is critically low, the BlackBerry PlayBook may remain on the boot screen until sufficient charge has been reached to fully boot the BlackBerry PlayBook.\n*********\n\n** Edit 8/9/12 - I got trolled when I posted my initial review, so I had to update this review with additional information that came up in the comments section.**\n\nI'll do you a favor and let you know about some of the threads on the official website for BlackBerry about problems with the battery. That's actually the FIRST site to come up when you do a Google search for \"BlackBerry PlayBook won't charge\".\n[...]\n\n9/11/2011\nPlaybook won't Charge!\n[...]\n\n5/8/2012\nAccepted Solution\nI tried everything and the PlayBook won't charge\n[...]\n\n5/5/2012\nPLAYBOOK WON'T CHARGE\n[...]\n\n3/7/2012\nPlaybook won't turn on, boot, or charge. LED flashing red.\n[...]\n\n11/23/2011\nPlaybook won't switch on, charge or reboot!\n[...]\n\n4/26/2011\nAccepted Solution\nPlay book won't power up or light just blinks\n[...]\n\nEven the die hard fans at the CrackBerry forums have been experiencing problems with the battery not charging on a BlackBerry Playbook going back to 2011. So apparently this is a long standing problem that RIM has had over a year to fix, but didn't do anything about.\n\n4/29/2011\nPlaybook won't charge -\n[...]\n\n5/8/2012\nPlaybook Won't Turn on and Won't debricked?\n[...]\n\n6/15/2012\nPlaybook won't start and solution\n[...]\n\n7/8/2012\nPlaybook stuck on 0% battery\n[...]\n\nThat's why it's so important that honest reviews on devices are so important. The average consumer is not aware of these long standing issues with the BlackBerry PlayBook. If you buy a device, you should be able to use it out of the box. Period. I base my reviews on what happens in the real world when I test the device. Real world reviews help consumers understand what to look for in making the decision whether or not to spend their money on a BlackBerry PlayBook. These Android tablets are too expensive to just throw money away on a dud. I don't work for RIM, so I write honest reviews of the products that I purchase."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "This is my first ever review, motivated only by my intense hatred of my blackberry.  I'm on my second blackberry playbook now, neither of which would charge again if you ever let the battery completely run out.  It's totally ridiculous that you can't let the battery completely drain without causing massive problems.  If you're considering buying this, save yourself the time and aggro and do a quick search in Google for \"my blackberry won't charge\".  You'll find a huge number of people experiencing this problem.  Not to mention that Ipod and all Android systems have a vastly larger number of apps than blackberry has now, or ever will have.  And where the same apps exist for all three, the ones for Blackberry too often have a charge -- due to blackberry having a smaller market and apparently being much more costly to actually write the app code for.  The hardware is actually nice, but what's the point if it doesn't work.  I can't believe I ever bought this.  Big mistake."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I've owned it for about eight (8) months now and here are the negatives after playing around with Android based tablets:\n\n* HEAVY tablet.  Not for bed-reading or even to carry as it adds considerable weight to messenger bag, in my case.\n\n* NO INTERNET BROWSERS available, just the pre-installed one, called simply \"browser\".  No customizing for Bookmarks nor creating folders in which to organize related/similar/most-visited sites.\n\n* FILE BROWSING is horrid especially when attaching files to emails (there's no \"folder-browsing\" available; ALL files are shown all at once for user to look for desired file.  Your only choice is to browse through Videos, Pictures, Documents and Music, no sub-folders).  Yes, there's a file browser called \"AIR Browser\" which is great and free for neatly filing and renaming file names and even creating folders, but isn't linked with the actual OS's apps, your e-mail, dropBox nor BB's Box (similar to dropbox).\n\n* BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY: More than often I have to manually pair the devices and re-enter the pairing code, which is a set of digits.  This last part can sometimes be a real annoyance.\n\n* RAM: many reviews brag about its RAM being able to handle many running apps.  While no visual apps are running my RAM is at 630MB free, but when I browse the internet it goes down to 300MB, without any other APPS running.\n\n* APPS AVAILABILITY: Not as many as Android's.  While gooereader.com offers a decent variety of translated apps to the PB, many do not operate well on it.\n\n* MUSIC PLAYER: Easy to use.  Browse music by artist, Albums and Genres.  Make playlist available, BUT, again, one cannot make folders or sub-categories based on the genre of music.  ALL the music you add to the playlist will show and play ALL together.\n\n* OS UPDATES: I've done probably 3 OS updates, but I haven't seen or noticed a significance in its performance nor the OS itself.  It was more the waste of memory it took.\n\nAll in all, I am selling mine or giving it away to a friend's kid to play games with.  I am buying myself an Android based Tablet.  I do not recommend this one.  If you are new to tablets and are looking around I strongly suggest you look elsewhere."}

Wish you luck if you decide to buy it."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "***UPDATE***\n\nI could not in good conscience leave my review as it was.  It was bad enough that to acquire and use the most basic and universally popular apps, I had to spend hours standing on my head, tweaking my PC, and researching Java info (I am NOT a techie) to put it all together; it was worse when the only market for buying and viewing movies and shows was the ridiculous Roxio market and its antiquated, user-hostile site.\n\nBut when, less than 5 months after purchase, my Playbook went the way of countless others, refusing to take a charge and eventually dying for the last time, I had it.  I can't even it sell for someone else to use for spare parts, etc., since I can't power it on to remove all my personal info.\n\nI tried so hard to support Blackberry, defending them to every mocking clerk at Best Buy or Radio Shack who saw my Torch 9810, jumping through the above referenced hoops to make it remotely useful to me, and my patience is rewarded with a $180 paperweight.  It is inexcusable that with so many users having this issue RIM did not support the problem in a proactive way.\n\nMy 7\" Samsung Galaxy 2.0 and I are just fine together, thank you.\n\nP.S. Shortly after its first anniversary, my Torch began to have issues with locking up constantly, requiring battery removal to resolve.  The day after it locked up  four times in one morning when I was only reviewing my pictures, I became the happy owner of a Galaxy S3.  I hope the new platform and devices work out better for Blackberry, but for now, I am done.\n---------------------------------\n\n... because 4 stars is a mite generous, but 3 too harsh in my opinion.\n\nHave had this for five days now and used it extensively.  Blackberry did a lot of things right with this, as compared to other 7\" tablets out there.  I should explain that I bought the Playbook as a replacement for my Kindle Fire for several reasons.  (And yes, I do recognize that Amazon never officially marketed the Fire as a \"tablet\".)\n\n1) I LOVE my Blackberry phone and based on its quality and intuitiveness, had some faith ahead of time in the Playbook's craftsmanship and usefulness.\n2) The Kindle Fire's limited device memory makes me crazy, and don't tell me about Cloud storage.  That is of greatly diminished value without 3G service.  No, Amazon could not have afforded to offer this for free with the Fire, but they could have made it an option which I would gladly have paid for, much as I do on my iPad.  In any event, the Playbook I selected (32GB) offers quadruple the device memory as the Kindle for only 25% more money.\n3)  No camera on the Fire; front and rear-facing on the Playbook.  You DO need good lighting for a decent shot, however.  My phone takes a much better picture and compensates with a flash for darker scenes.\n4)  The Blackberry Bridge option which synced in a wink all the data on my Torch 9810, and the option to tether the tablet to my phone for 3G service (yes, at an additional charge.)\n\nSo far I have decided the Fire is going up on eBay, but the jury is still out on whether or not I'll return the Playbook.\n\nPROS\n-Much larger memory than the Fire\n-Terrific graphics\n-Icons laid out on desktop in the usual manner.  Sorry, I find the Fire's carousel approach silly and unwieldy, and have the impression it was used for the sole purpose of doing something different (whether it was a better idea or not.)\n-Menus and page minimization super easy to manipulate.\n-File manager from which I can access .pdfs, pictures, music, etc.  Nice to have it centralized and files of all types neatly listed.\n-True stereo output, with speakers on BOTH sides (unlike the Fire).  Sound quality is impressive.\n-Option for use with a separate keyboard, though RIM severely underproduced the most reliable keyboard out there.  Cheaper versions seem to have mixed reviews.  Regardless, a reliable external keyboard could effectively turn the Playbook into a respectable netbook IMO.\n-Reasonably priced\n-USB cable makes loading music, documents, etc. from both my office PC and home iMac a breeze.\n\nCONS (and why it might go back)\n-NO KINDLE APP!!  Seriously??  For the first time, Amazon has managed to majorly disappoint me.  The company shot off its mouth over a year ago that one would be available for the Playbook, but no.  Interesting how the tune changed after the Fire came out, and all indications are that they have no interest in doing so now.  Earlier Playbook users were able to sideload various Android apps including Kindle, but it appears RIM has since made it impossible to do this with the newer OS.  Can I read my large Kindle library via the Playbook's browser/Cloud reader?  Yes.  But it is slow, and again dependent on wi-fi.\n-No Skype app.  Video chat is an option, but not via Skype, the best known and used app/program out there for the purpose.\n-No Netflix app.\n-Come to think of it... WHY are there so few apps?  Adding my voice to the huge chorus regarding this limitation, but what I find especially ridiculous are all the apps available to my phone that are not for the Playbook.  How dumb is that?\n-Shorter battery life than the Fire.  Significantly.\n-Often slow to connect to wi-fi when I have switched locations, even when the new hotspot has already been saved.  My phone, iPad, and Kindle Fire all seamlessly switch over, but so far, not the Playbook.\n\nIn general, the Playbook has a lot going for it over and above the Fire.  If it included a Kindle app, there would be no question of keeping it.  I have looked at other 7\" tablets, and found them lacking across the board at the Playbook's price point.  The Galaxy offers more but obviously you pay for it.  At that MSRP, I'd just as soon sit tight and wait for Apple's (rumored) smaller iPad in the works."}

I made  judgments on which reviews are constructive, and which are just plainly absurd. I settled on the Playbook. So, I wasn't disappointed when I got my Playbook in June this year.\n\nI took it on my trip in July to the Canadian Rockies. I was pleased that I could check both my personal e-mail on Yahoo and my work e-mail on Outlook. I took pictures using the Playbook (I had the camera on and put in in the pocket of the car door) when I couldn't fire up my Sony Hx9v fast enough to snap pictures of mountain goats, sheep and elks. (Almost took a picture of a black bear crossing the road. Kathy: Look, a bear. Bear: Oh #$%^, humans).\n\nI have since been able to side-load some android apps, which now has become a bonus. I am now able to read magazine from our public libraries. All in all I am happy.\n\nA side note: Blackberry people, you need to market your products better!\n\nUpdated on August 25, 2012\nOK, so I didn't expect to do heavy-duty work on the PB. I did use the Print to Go feature, as well as sending myself word, pdf and PPT docs by email. I am able to work to the fullest extent that PB is capable of. Then, I do back to work and immediate hit the road running. That makes my Mondays are more prepared and pleasant.\n\nMy Sony Hx9v is my dedicated camera, but I also take \"duplicate\" pics and videos on my playbook for sharing them with my co-workers. It's more handy and discrete than putting them on my work computer, and the Sony scree is too small anyways.\n\nI also take the PB to off site meetings (we have WiFi at all our sites). I bring the PB instead of lugging my labtop to allow access to work e-mail and essential documents in the PB, if case I need to refer to them.\n\nAugust 26 update:\nI wasn't sure what apps are in the App Store, so I just enter an alphabet in the search box. Then I browse what's available. Hope this helps."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Features and price:\nFirst, I am an avid apple consumer and it would seem that an iPad would be my first choice in buying a tablet, it was not. Simply because it doesn't read flash, it's too big, and I think the price is a little ridiculous to pay for something that's a larger scale of what I already have and doesn't do everything I want it to do. However, I still wanted something aesthetically appealing, sleek, sturdy, and about $200. I looked at the kindle fire but it lacks a camera and I looked at the nexus 7 but at $200 you get 8g instead of 16g. I had seen the PB at Best Buy and a few minutes playing with it I wanted it .. After further research and reading the reviews (good/bad) I bought it for these reasons: The screen quality is awesome and makes the screen look bigger than 7inches, the fluidity of the platform is so sleek, and I really like the swipe up/swipe down feature (instead of the home button on an iPad). It has a rubberized back for a no slip grip and is light. Sound is great n doesn't sound cheap. I read the battery life was long and it definitely is!  After the first charge I didn't have to recharge for 3 days .. I suppose if you use it all day long it'll last about 9hrs.\n\nApps:\nIf you're an app maniac don't buy it! The PB does not play Netflix which is a bummer but I honestly watch Netflix only on a TV, it doesn't have instagram but I'm not trying to whip out a tablet to take a picture, that's what my iPhone is for, and as far as games go, everytime I've DL one on my iPhone it becomes a waste of space and I usually delete them after a few days . As a college student, Docs to go and adobe reader (comes standard) is great,  it will definitely come in handy for lecture when I have to write or retrieve PDF and word documents. It also comes with the essential FB, twitter, and YouTube apps. From what I have been reading on the net there are ways to sideload android apps,haven't tried .. Not sure if I will.\n\nInternet and wifi:\nThe wifi connection is strong and picks up signals my laptop can't..Im sure the Bluetooth connection is just as strong just haven't tried it. The Internet browsing is crisp, clear, and fast! I REALLY needed a tablet that read flash I shop a lot online and a lot of sites use it and my online class requires it for viewing homework and since the PB reads flash it's perfect and runs smoothly with no freezing. Other reviewers say its like browsing on a desktop and they're right!\n\nAccessories:\nNot very many and kinda hard to find. I'm really big on housing for my devices but I ended up finding this Swedish company, Dicota , that makes covers for playbook and has a nice quality.\n\nOverall, extremely satisfied with my BBPB! Would recommend to anyone who likes products that do just what they say they do at a great price!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "First off, I want to state from the get-go I am a big Blackberry fan.  I have a small exhibit of BBs on display in my home going back 10 years.  They are reliable, sturdy, and serious machines. RIM remained true to their core beliefs while others focused on what most people really seem to want: entertainment, and it cost them.  The company's belated entry into the tablet market has been justly panned. Still I bought this device as a backup tablet given the lower price.  On the positive front, the build quality is high.  Its small size is very convenient for carrying (keep it safely tucked in a bag until you reach your destination). The screen and sound quality are among the best I have encountered.  However, in the end, there are just as many defects.  The touch screen has poor tactile resonance; many times I have tried in vain to magnify a screen or attempted to tap on a Google link.  The screen is just too small to hit the mark unless you have tiny fingers or a stylus.  That won't be of any help trying to enlarge or shrink a page, however.  The power button and volume controls require inordinate pressure to respond.  Apps are limited and even basic ones like synching with Gmail malfunctions more than it works.  No Skype as of yet. Amazon videos don't much seem to work.  And iTunes doesn't isn't available. What am I going to put on 64 gig drive? The calculator is among the strangest I have ever worked with.  One major headache is the prolonged startup time.  I am surprised that any RIM product could take that long to start. The bottom line is unless you are an enthusiast, there are plenty of better tablets on the market (Thrive, though not without its issues) in this and larger configurations."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "If you are looking at the Blackberry Playbook tablet, there are a few things you should know about it before ordering. It is a great device at a great price now that it's been reduced. 64gb is quite a lot of space for storing files and media.\n\nInternet: If you have a Blackberry phone, this device can get an internet connection over something called the blackberry bridge without requiring a tethering plan from your provider.\n\nEmail: There are two applications for email. There is a built-in app (that was introduced with the last OS update) and there is a Blackberry Bridge App. The bridged app just displays your phone's inbox (minus text messages), the built-in application downloads messages directly over an internet connection.\n\nContacts: There are two contacts programs. Again, one bridged and one built in.\n\n* Bridge vs Built-In *: Here is the biggest problem (IMHO) with the device. Because blackberry wants to keep corporate information as safe as possible, there are quite a few barriers between local information on the device and the Bridged data. For instance, you cannot send email from the built-in application to a contact only available on the bridged contacts. This is a problem because there is no way to directly sync your contacts from Outlook (or comparable program) to the playbook. You need to sync to an online address book and then set the device to sync with that. The other problem I have run into is that you cannot attach local files to email you're sending over the Bridged mail application. This means you can't attach a picture you took on the playbook to a message you want to send over bridged mail.\n\nOrientation Lock: Ok, here's an issue that has annoyed me quite a bit. The display normally hops between landscape and portrait according to the way you're holding the device. You have the ability to lock the orientation if you wish. There are some applications that only run in landscape mode. If I have the display locked in portrait mode and then open one of these applications (mail, weather, etc...) then my display ends up locked in landscape. Easy enough to fix, but quite annoying.\n\n* Netflix / Amazon Video *: There is no support for streaming video from the major places you want to stream video from. The device has the physical ability to display this video, there is just no software on there that will allow it. There is no solution to this announced. I didn't buy this for video streaming, so it's not that big an issue for me, but it does seem like this is a big tablet use for some buyers so I think it's worth mentioning.\n\n*EDIT* Amazon video does now work. I had tried once when I first bought the tablet, but hadn't tried again until someone responded to this review.\n\nOffice Applications: The device comes with Documents to Go, which is good for opening attached Microsoft Office files. It is very limited as far as creating a new document, but good enough for viewing. A couple of limitations I have run into are that the word compatible application doesn't support headers and also doesn't allow you to create a table. You can enter information into an existing table, but cannot make a new one (at least as far as I can tell). I spent some time setting up templates with tables and replaced the header with a single image file. It's not perfect, but does what I need in a pinch. The excel compatible application's biggest limitation is that it can't lock the header row. Dealing with a spreadsheet on a small screen can be a bit cumbersome because of this.\n\nMedia : I haven't used the media sync software, since I choose to just drag and drop the files I want onto the device. I have dropped quite a few video and audio files on the tablet and the built-in applications have played them all without problem.\n\nApps: There is an app store for the device, but the offering is extremely limited compared to the Apple and Android app stores. The Playbook does have the ability to run Android applications, but apps that need internet access won't work over the blackberry bridge connection. You will need to use wifi for access if required. It may work if you set the phone connection as tethered instead of bridged, but I haven't played with this.\n\nI know I have focused on some negatives, but I have really enjoyed this device in the months I have owned it. I just thought it was important to lay out the limitations because it is difficult to find this information online. Most of the reviews available came out when the device was new, on the original operating system. The update released in February greatly expanded the built-in features, including the built-in contacts and email applications.\n\nIf you're looking for a tablet to complement your blackberry, this is the right device. For my own use, it has saved me from breaking out the laptop or a printout quite a bit. It comes in incredibly handy for opening attachments, since I don't like scrolling through documents on my phone's screen. If you're app-happy and you're looking to make beats or edit video on your tablet, this may not be the right device for you."}

Perfect size to carry in my purse, I use it constantly at home or on the go.\n\nFantastic value for the $200 price, quality build, blazing fast.  Takes great photos, can share them via email or social networking sites instantly. Tethered to my phone, it works seamlessly at no extra data charge.\n\nLove, love, love the interface, true multitasking. Effortless, elegant.\n\nI bought an iPad2 a few months prior, at five times the price, hate the clunky slow interface and never use it anymore, too big and heavy to carry around.  I work in a large IT department, many of my colleagues have made the change from iPad to PB in the past few months, it's just a better device for business or pleasure.\n\nMy favourite application is library one, download free books from any public library. More apps available every day.\n\nBought three PB's as gifts for family members, wonderful gifts for great value. Our home PC is rarely used anymore.\n\nA writer friend bought one with accessory keyboard , she travels a lot and loves keeping a journal on the road.  Last trip she forgot her camera but was thrilled with the PB camera and ability to email quality photos from the road.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I was once a devout Blackberry user but because blackberry hadn't developed any new and exciting phones recently, I transported to the Samsung Galaxy line of phones. Though I like the Galaxy, I've missed my blackerry experience and longed for a playbook when it came out; but the price and the limited functionality kept pushing me away. Needless to say, once Blackberry released their 2.0 version of the blackberry playbook, and the great price reduction, I knew I had to grab one! For the price, it is more than what I expected. I did A LOT of reaserch before purchasing a tablet. The apps are lacking but I had come to terms with that before I made up my mind to buy a Playbook. Because I wasn't clear about the direction of RIM, I knew what I was getting. The internet browser is fast and very efficient and for the price its what I wanted (something faster to access than my laptop.) Also, with Camera and video capability I take it everywhere I go. For right around $150 you can't get a better tablet in my opinion. My only suggestion to buyers is to pony up and get a good case the first time around. I went cheap and ended up getting the ballistic case a week after getting the playbook. In conclusion, I'm very happy with my purchase. If you're looking at reviews you're probably in the market for a tablet as I was, I can assure you now that you will not be disappointed with the Blackberry Playbook and if you buy from the same seller as I, they will deliver above expectaions with lightning fast shipping and a product that comes equipped with all of the trimmings you would expect from a brand new unit!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I bought the Playbook for my wife as a gift. I did not buy it on Amazon but elsewhere and I just wanted to give my comments on it.\n\nPROS:\n\n1- Integration with my wife BlackBerry was easy, she can use her BBM, BB Calendar, BB email, documents right there on her Playbook after sync. She can use her phone data plan too on the tablet without any extra $$ cost or requiring reconfiguration.\n\n2- The Office App is the best I have found on a touch device (Docs, Excel and Presentations), she uses it every day and she can decide where to save them, on the Playbook himself or in her BlackBerry.\n\n3- Perfect size for her needs, nice bright and DPI screen, I love the speakers (2 of them put in front of the device: some other brands only have 1 speaker placed in the back the sound doesn't feel right).\n\n4- Apps, well some say there are no apps in here but there are a lot, maybe not the same quantity than Apple Appstore or Google Play but you have all that you might need... Comes with 3 big games (Need for Speed, and 2 others I don't remember cuz I don't play -my wife doesn't play too- that much :-P)\n\n5- Best internet browser I have seen on mobile devices or tablets, yes I think its better than Android and Safari its is fluid and can render Flash without any problems, Its really like browsing on a full Desktop PC.\n\n6- Multitasking way better than iPad, and maybe even better than Android ICS, its so intuitive to pass from an open App to another one, to close them, to chose another one. Trust me, its amazing what this little tablet can do.\n\n7- Playbook OS 2.1 its a nice piece of OS, RIM needs more developers to put more apps in here ... and the better part is that now if you don't have any BlackBerry phone, it doesn't matter because you have Calendar, Email, Docs, Facebook, etc without needing a BlackBerry (the phone its a plus, but not necessary)\n\n8- Battery life is really good, I have used it on a trip for more than 5 hours watching movies and at then end, battery was like 55% - 60%\n\n9- Nice back camera, taken videos and pictures with it and really nice.\n\n10- Standard connectors Micro USB and Mini HDMI that you can hook easily to you TV\n\nCONS:\n\n1- It feels a bit heavier when compared to other 7 inch tablets (I compared the Samsung 7 inch and this before buying)\n\n2- Maybe more Apps... well to be honest the only real one that I want and can't find is Skype so I can use the front camera\n\n3- No expansion card..\n\nI can say that it is the best 7 inch 16GB tablet you can have for $199, yes now there is the Nexus Tab 7 for the same price but its a 8GB ... if you have an extra $55 go buy Nexus Tab 7 16GB or Samsung 7.0 only if you are worried about not having apps, but for me and my wife the Playbook cover all our needs (Office apps, Browser, Twitter and Facebook, some casual games, watching movies, pictures)"}

You can side load a few Android apps, but it is somewhat of a pain. It preforms well, the battery life is okay. It has decent resolution and the touchscreen works well. I am not at all happy with the seller ANTOnile. The unit was represented as new, but the unit I received had been obviously opened and resealed. I contacted them and they basically denied the unit sent was used or manufactured. Thee were two layers of tape sealing the unit, the bottom piece had been cut. This makes the unit an open box. They refused to make things right. So I basically feel I was scammed. I will never buy from ANTOnile again. I buy all my electronics as well as other merchandise from Amazon, but if they continue to allow sellers to misrepresent merchandise I will not use their site for any purchases."}

RIM's tablet packs the power of a mini-laptop in a pocket-sized form.\n\nPros:\n\n- It has crystal-clear display\n- Very resistant and stoutly built\n- Fast, with more than enough power to run heavy applications and games.\n- Feature-rich with HD rear facing camera, a chatting front-faced camera, GPS, Wi-fi, HDMI and Bluetooth.\n- GPS apps don't work while connected only to BlackBerry Bridge but they work while tethered to a BlackBerry phone or connected to a wi-fi mobile AP on Android (see below) The included app Bing Maps does a good job similar to google maps, and can even give me driving directions (in my country, Google Maps doesn't do that)\n\nWhen partnered with a BlackBerry phone (I have one) the result is more than the sum of its parts. The tablet can function as a big screen for the phone, and the phone works as a wireless modem for the tablet (over Bluetooth)\n\nIf you have an android phone v2.2 or above (I have one too) the phone can share its  internet connection with the Playbook via Mobile Wi-fi AP. Also, I can transfer files between the phone and the tablet with an android free application installed on the phone called AirDroid.\n\nCons:\n\n- A little bit on the heavy side, but still lighter than any 10 inch tablet.\n- Battery life isn't spectacular, when I used it through the day, I must charge it overnight, every night.\n- A certain lack of applications, but this is an item that gets more value as more people buy it. Eventually more apps will be released."}

However as a workhorse my Playbook is pretty awesome. I carry important word docs and business planning stuff on excel right with me now. Even updated a powerpoint one morning while listening to pandora, checking news,FB,etc. The ability to minimize apps and Internet windows and scroll through them flicking them away if finished or tapping them to use is handy. The Conqu to do app is very powerful and I have projects and personal stuff all at my fingertips. At Panera the other day I was frustrated with the speed of the wifi so I jumped on my phone's Internet access through Verizon via BlackBerry bridge.  It works great. The size is way better than ipad.  I think it's a matter of public uninformed opinion and poor marketing from BlackBerry.  They brought the tablet to market too soon with no native email client. All the reviews make such a big negative deal about the bridge to the phone. And then everyone wrote it off. The folks at staples and office Depot are clueless and of no help.

I got the 16GB which I think is enough for me, I don't use it for taking pictures that's what my Camera is for. I did buy this with my own money, for a cheap, cheap price of $139.00! It's just amazing what happends when you wait for new electronics to come out. I bought a Nook (first generation on Amazon.com - used) for $75.00 (originally $130.00), this was after the new nook came out during the holiday's.\n\nI would certainly give this a try!\nThanks for reading!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "For the price you cannot beat the hardware level of this tablet. The cameras are very good for a tablet for both pictures and video. The browser will for the most part display webpages as they are intended. I like having a full browser. The support for flash is good though a few websites won't let you view video content through this mobile browser. No support for Hulu or Netflix is a disappointing drawback. The quantity of apps available for the playbook are definitely not on par with iPad or android but the situation is improving. If this tablet would've had a fully functional USB port and expandable micro card storage it would have seen far greater success in the marketplace. All in all this tablet is a very good value for the money."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "This Blackberry PlayBook is sooo much fun. The more I use it the better I like it. I looked at tablets for at least two months before deciding that this was the way to go. I wanted an e-reader but also something that I could easily carry with me that was capable of reading and writing e-mail, as well as surfing the web. This is all that and much more! This is a well designed, quality, full featured, miniature computer! It, and the Blackberry cover 'Research in Motion Leather Convertible Case for BlackBerry Playbook (ACC-40279-301)'  that I keep it in fits nicely into the patch pockets of my cloth bomber style jacket. Unlike complaints from some case reviews, this case can be kept attached to the PlayBook while charging and the on/off and volume buttons can also be used while the PlayBook is kept snugly stored inside the rubber-like gasket frame of the case.\n\nThe first thing it did when I powered it up was prompt me to download the all new OS 2.1\n\nThe sound is better than on most laptops that I've used in the last 8 years.\n\nThe battery appears to hold up extremely well for what I'm doing with it so far. I believe they say it'll last about 8 hours under average use.. I see no reason to doubt that. It will charge for me either with the ac adaptor or with the USB connection on the Sleep `n Charge USB port of my laptop.\n\nI've only taken one picture with it in the few days that I've owned it but it came out great and I'm sure it, and the video cam, will operate as advertised. (very easily, great quality..)\n\nAt first I thought I would be basically stuck with the dozen or so sites that came pre-loaded on the Browser. Every time that I tried to enter an e-address into the search bar it told me I couldn't go there. Then I attached the USB cord from the PlayBook to my laptop, while searching from the PlayBook, and tried it again.. and now I can go anywhere and save the site, such as weather radar, in the PlayBook! OR, as I found out later, I can just go to the search bar in the Browser and download sites directly to the PlayBook (as long as I don't forget to turn the wi-fi on).\n\nThe digital keyboard is much easier to use than I thought it would be, with very few typing errors. When typing e-mails the machine guesses half a dozen words that may be coming up next and displays them on a toolbar above the message. Choose a word and it includes the space following. Sometimes it guesses correctly which word you want, even before you begin to type it. Start a sentence and it automatically capitalizes the first letter. Forget about using apostrophes.. it adds them automatically where applicable!\n\nI was a little awed and slightly disappointed with this PlayBook, the first day or so. I am, and probably always will be a little awed by this machine and how much it can do packed into such a small space.. but the disappointment went away very fast as I quickly became accustomed to using it and how well it all worked!\n\nI look forward to getting a great deal of enjoyment from this Blackberry PlayBook for years to come and would give it an absolutely unqualified recommendation, to friends and loved ones!"}

I think the biggest down fall would be the apps. If you are going to buy this to play games on you would have fun playing the games but there are not many to choose from. The app selection for games in very low and the apps are a little pricey compared to apples. You can sync music with iTunes so that is nice. The multi-tasking system work great! I like it better than the iPad. The system is slowly improving and i would recommend it to many if you do not mind the app selection."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I have an Ipad2 (from my employer) but I found it frustrating because it was WIFI only; internet and email was only accessible where there was open wifi. Also the Ipad is relatively large and heavy compared to a 7\" tablet and finally the Ipad couldn't configure my Microsoft exchange based email account.\n\nI have a blackberry phone and heard about the playbook's feature that enables users to use the phone's internet accesss on the playbook.  The other deciding factors was the very reasonable price (a small fraction of the cost of the Ipad) and the lighter/smaller size of the playbook vs the Ipad.  I also had confidence in the playbook's email capabilities premised upon the blackberry telephone's ability to immediately and flawlessly configure and intergrate my email accounts including the Microsoft Exchange based account.\n\nI purchased the 16GB version of the Playbook.  Upon powering up (and connecting to WIFI), the playbook immediately updated the OS to the latest version (took about 20 minutes for download and installation) automatically. The screen is very bright and sharp comparable (but not quite there) to the Ipad.  The touch screen is also excellent and (almost) as good as the Ipad.  There is no button to return the home screen (rendering the Ipad more convenient in this context).\n\nThe apps available for the Playbook pale in comparison to the Ipad.  However two particular apps; docs to go (included in the OS) and Blackberry Bridge (free download) make the Playbook more appealing to me than the Ipad.  Blackberry Bridge seamlessly lets your blackberry telephone provide internet access to the Playbook (after an easy bluetooth connection is established).  It's really amazing.  There is no longer any \"tethering\" app needed (which apparently was necessary in the old OS). The internet for some unexplained reason is much faster on the playbook than on the phone (perhaps because of processing power involved in screen redraws but I am not really sure why). Docs to go is a Microsoft Office type program similar (to the extent a 7\" tablet can be) and compatible with Microsoft Word.  The Ipad does not have any such program built in and available apps (for purchase; ie pages) are not as good.\n\nBattry life is great, a whole day even with wifi on.  As expected, all my email accounts are intergrated and accessible on the playbook (although the phone's setup seemed a little easier) including the Microsoft Exchange based account that the Ipad could not configure to work. Email contacts, calenders, BBM contacts etc are all easily imported from the phone.\n\nThere is one big drawback (for me anyway) and the reason I only gave 4 stars in this review; the icompatibility of Skype.  There is an excellent webcam on the playbook but for some reason there is no Skype app.  The only way to access the video communciation capabilities is by communicating with another playbook.  The Ipad (in contrast) works really, really well with skype.  Someone would make a lot of money if they developed a reasonably priced app that enabled skype to work on the playbook based upon the clamor on the internet for such an app.  If Skype becomes compatible with the Playbook, the Blackberry Playbook would be a really great tablet at this price point.\n\nThere is no (Micro)SD slot to expand the internal memory.  The cynic in me believes that is because RIM would like to sell the 32GB version for more money than the 16GB version (there would not be much demand for the 32GB version if there was expandable storage capabilities).  Of course the Ipad does not have any such capabilities either (presumambly for the same reason).\n\nMP3 playback works great on the playbook.  It is much easier to copy MP3s onto the playbook than the ipad (no itunes necessary).  A free app makes creating playlists as simple as creating folders on the Playbook (much better than the Ipad or even the ipod).  Videos are also much easier to copy onto the playbook (again no itunes necessary).  However, the file formats seem to be more limited on the playbook; I have been unable to find an app to play .avi files so far.\n\nBefore purchasing the Blackberry Tablet, I tried (and immediately returned) one of the generic $100 android 7\" tablets.  There is really no comparison between the playbook and the cheap android tablets.  The touch screen on these 7\" android tablets is terrible, WIFI routinely cuts off, the screen is not very bright and the battery only lasts a few hours.  The only \"advantages\" of the cheap 7\" tablets is compatibility with skype (which works horribly) and many more apps which is not really and avantage since the tablet itself is not usable.\n\nIn summary, this is an excellent tablet considering the price.  It becomes almost essential if you also have a blackberry telephone.  The lack of Skype compatibility may be a deal breaker for some though."}

It turns out they are all unusable on this tablet. And it opens 2 or 3 windows max, at one time.  I thought this was a cheaper, smaller version of a netbook, but I was, regrettably, wrong.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "The BlackBerry playbook is by far the most capable tablet around. I have used the playbook for approximately 3 months. The browser is amazing which closely resembles a desktop like experience. One issue I have with this tab is the lack of apps, however, the flash enabled browser makes up for it; minus Hulu blocking access to its Site. There are some minor annoyances like the random browser crash (rarely with OS 2.0.1.358) or 3rd party app crashes. The most problematic issue I have came across was when I would open an android app through the app player which would make the entire OS run less efficient. I hardly use the anrdoid app player, so I'm not too annoyed. The main selling point for me was the small form factor and the drastic price drop which made this tab irresistible. I highly recommend this product if you mainly utilize the browser. This product is only getting better and the value with this product is immense."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I've tried several tablet pc's, including Google's android and Dell's Streak. None met my hopes or expectations. So, since I have a Blackberry Torch Smart Phone, I thought purchasing the Blackberry Playbook would be a perfect match.\n\nBoy, was I wrong! Some other reviewers have mentioned the \"coming soon\" promises that have not delivered. Come on, Blackberry! What's your problem?\n\nI love the ease of use. The touch screen, all of it. But, at this moment, that's about all I love. I have Amazon's Kindle for Blackberry Smartphone but my eyes can't deal with it. I'd HOPED that with the playbook, and synchronization, I'd be able to read the 150 Kindle books I've bought on the playbook. Turns out Blackberry does not have the Kindle app for the playbook. I've searched for go-rounds to get the Kindle app, and found several, but, good grief! The complicated steps to go through to get it have almost driven me over the edge. I download this, download that, and when I try to install/activate it, I'm told it is not recognized.\n\nMaybe Blackberry will get into the act and bring their Playbook into the 21st Century. I'm not going to wait. I think I'm going to return it.\n\nUPDATE: June 19, 2011\nRegarding the Kindle issue. I should have added that I found the Crackberry site where there are instructions on how to sideload the app for Android. Tried to follow very carefully, but all I ended up with were icons on my pc desktop that go nowhere. Even the DDPB installer doesn't work. Clicking on it, this pops up: \"not java! close app!\" and I had just previously downloaded the Java, even though I already had it installed. And the .bar extension seems to be unrecognized by Windows.\n\nThen I found out I could access my Kindle books--over 150 of them--through The Cloud. Except The Cloud is only available through the Chrome and Firefox browsers. Chrome is my default browser on my PC, so I thought, \"Cool, I'll just install Chrome on the Playbook. No dice. It downloads. It appears on the Playbook list when I opened \"downloads\" but it won't install. The Playbook doesn't recognize it. I'm not a greenhorn when it comes to technology but that sideload stuff gave me a headache. No matter how many times I watched the video, starting and stopping it to try to keep up, I got nowhere.\n\nSo, all in all, a very unsatisfactory experience. I think I'm going to look into the Kindle Fire. At least I KNOW it will let me read my Kindle books. Or maybe I'll just give up on a tablet and stay with my plain vanilla Kindle reader.\n\nThe Playbook is being returned. Thanks, Amazon, for making returns so easy and painless."}

However, I think that after all I've been through with this product, I had to say something.\n\nI received my Playbook in January and I really did love it. I was not a big person on having a bunch of apps or games because I was mainly using it for work and school. It'd be nice, but it is not absolutely necessary. The best part of this tablet is multitasking. You can easily open a browser, swipe up, open your email, swipe up, open facebook, etc. It was 100% user friendly. So I thought this product was great for the price until...\n\nIt just stopped charging. I have tried leaving in the charger for hours even days. I left in charged into my computer for hours. I even bought a charging station to charge it and it just flat out does not work. The WORST part about this whole thing is, they want me to pay for customer service since I am outside the 90 day range of purchase. I have had this product for about half a year and it breaks downs and they want me to pay them for a problem with their product.\n\nIt is not just me, just google \"My blackberry playbook won't charge\" or \"won't turn on\" and you'll get a whole thread of people who have the same issue. The customer service is the worst part about it because there is simply a lack of any. I called a multiple numbers and they can only redirect me to the one that cost money. Why should I pay when I have had this product for less than a year and I did not do anything (like drop it) to keep it from working.\n\nDon't put yourself through this. There is an issue with the playbook and you can google it all. There is no help on their end so if you have troubles with yours, all you have left is a $200 coaster. Please just save your money and go buy a product that actually at least a year or offers some decent customer support for any issue that comes up."}

I have read all the reviews, pros and cons at different intervals of time......however I would just like to shed some light on some popular issues, and get to the bottom line, as I have bought 2 64GB versions for both my wife and I...and we love them and couldn't be happier:\n\nMyths:\n\n1) Unless you're the Hulk, the Power Button is not too small. The button is very well designed and is easily accessible. Everyone just kept jumping on the bandwagon review after review\n\n2) Apps, well I admit that BB app-world currently does not have an avalanche of apps, however there are some very good ones. Apps which can really enhance you productivity. Besides it ships with \"docs on the go\" which allows you to edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint Files on the go...without any additional cost...Thank You BB\n\nCons:\n\n1) Battery life could be longer, I get about 8hrs with full utilization, but many tablets like this one fail in comparison to the industry benchmark i-pad\n\nPro's:\n\n1) Sleek and sexy with a very high quality design build. The materials feel very executives, not cheap like some other items currently on the market\n2) Camera's capture outstanding quality\n3) Internet, OK the 4G version didn't materialize but I still have internet access when I utilize my Blackberry phone's internet plan. This saves me an additional cost every month, as both my smartphone and tablet utilize the same plan. Thank You BB\n4) Screen, very very vibrant images\n5) Sound, very very good sound quality considering the size of the device\n6) Price, 64Gb model for 299USD....\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nNO other competitor comes close to providing this amount of quality for this price. You get the world renowned support of Blackberry, with all the ingredients to work hard and play harder."}

I have to tell you that I researched a lot prior to buying this tablet, ok the iPad shure is better BUT is a lot bigger, heavier and expensive, I'm not able to type as fast with the iPad as with the PlayBook, awsome virtual keyboard, I dream of having one like that in my Torch 9860 that is not great as the one provided with QNX.\n\nAbout apps, this is a professional tablet for work so I'm very satisfied with the Docs to Go app that is WONDERFUL I do edit a lot of docs on the go and I need a simple and convenient way to do presentations so the mini HDMI port is the key for me for that, just plug the tablet to a big screen and I'm set. If I need to play perhaps I'll be buying an iPad but I do work most with tablets and other thing about apps that seems to be a headache for many: How many apps do you need? and most af all how many apps do you actually use? when someone asked that to me wow the list shrunk to only a few (no more than 10) and the App World has grown a lot since the release of the system 2.0 back in February.\n\nHardware related: this tablet is solid made with a great appeal, 2 full hd cameras sadly no camera flash, fast response, smooth animations, great resolution for a 7 inch tablet and great sound with the two front speakers.

I haven't picked up my iPad since I bought this thing, no exaggeration. After playing with every tablet out there I could get my mitts on, I decided on the Playbook, and it was the best decision. I couldn't be happier. It's the perfect size, the app store has everything I need and want, and, it goes without saying, the browser squashes everything else out there. The size is perfect. Even the on-screen keyboard (which I usually don't like) is smooth as butter. Uploading audio and video files from my desktop computer is easy as pie, and, as long as the audio track to the movie is in MP3 format, everything plays. There is no stuttering. The true multitasking is magnificent. Hats off to RIM for building this, the king of all tablets. I payed $300 for the 64GB version, and I'm still slack-jawed at what a steal this was, especially compared to Apple's offering. BlackBerry Bridge is brilliant. Both cameras are stunning. The display is stunning. The design is pure genius and accents functionality; imagine: front-facing stereo speakers...who'da thunk? A hardened rubber backing so it will not slip...who knew? Like all RIM products, it flawlessly does what it's designed to do, every time, all the time. The iPad 2 is like a French Bulldog...adorable, soothing, fun and a great way to get compliments. Not exactly the smartest dog out there, but a great attention-getter. The BlackBerry Playbook is like a Panther or a Cheetah...a perfectly-designed machine for its environment; efficient, agile, super-strong, with laser-sharp focus and intent.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Note:  During the last 14 days, RIM/Blackberry announced that it was discontinuing the 16 gigabyte model (limiting sales to existing stock), but not abandoning the 32 and 64 gigabyte models.  My expectation is that any important OS updates RIM provides for the 32 and 64 gig models will also apply to the 16 gig models.\n\nBackground:  My use of the Playbook is primarily for business, so that perspective largely impacts my review.\n\nValue: Excellent value for the hardware and software that comes with the Playbook.  That's why I don't mind tossing a few bucks for some apps, altho I'd prefer to pay more up front and not have to search for some essential apps, some of which have shortcomings.\n\nOS and Blackberry Support of the OS:  Software/Installation Process Should Be Better\n\nThe RIM websites devoted to the Playbook have some useful instructional videos, but these websites are also disorganized and unnecessarily confusing in areas.\n\nI'd prefer to have the option of updating the OS using the USB cable and the Blackberry software I can access from the RIM site(s).\n\nThe on-board standard file manager that comes with the Playbook is very limited and doesn't show many files and folders on the Playbook.  (I've been trying out some file manager apps from the Blackberry Appworld.)  For limited file management, one can also change the Playbook's \"Storage and Sharing\" settings or use the the Blackberry Desktop software installed on a laptop/desktop in conjunction with a USB cable connected to Playbook.\n\nThe Playbook has a .pdf reader installed, as well as Docs to Go, which includes mobile versions of MS Word, Excel, and Powerpoint.  Trying to open versions of a document that I had created in the MS Word format as well as the .pdf format, the .pdf reader provided better readability, showing page numbers and a signature, whereas Docs to Go did not.  Opening a PowerPoint file that contained audio, Docs to Go showed the slides but did not recreate the audio.  Perhaps there are apps or other software I could procure to address this shortcoming\n\nThe Playbook allows me to tether via Bluetooth to a Nokia smartphone that connects to a Tmobile data service.  This arrangement works very well, the connection remaining unbroken for 2-4 hours on occasion.  However, certain apps, such as the Playbooks App World app won't work with this type of connection, but will work with a WiFi connection.\n\nUsing the default video recording settings created files of about 4 gigs in size during an hour and a half of recording.  Because I don't do much digital video recording, I can't validly compare the Playbook's capabilities in this area with similarly priced instruments.\n\nRecently, I bought the OEM Blackberry charging stand, which has been reviewed on the Amazon website.  I will probably buy the OEM Blackberry bluetooth keyboard, which altho pricier than most of the alternatives, probably works considerably better with the Playbook, based on many reviews I have read.\n\nAFAIK, the Playbook doesn't come with a password manager.  I paid 1.99 or 2.99 for the Vault, from Xlabz.  This works fairly well.  However, this software provides for offsite backing up, using DropBox.  This is a step I don't want to take, because of my security concerns re: Dropbox.  I'm hoping that a more comprehensive file manager will allow me to find one or more password manager files on the Playbook that I can use for onsite backing up of the password manager.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the music player combined with the Playbook's speakers work well in light of the device's speaker size limitations."}

Even after several OS updates BB still has problems to sort out this device as it freezes several times a day. BB should seriously look at making a proper OS for this.\n\nThis item did not have much details about the technical specs it had. I was under the impression that it at least had SD card slot or USB 2.0 but it has neither. I need to buy an adaptor cable to be able to transfer directly from USB flash drive to this device. Also i updated the software on this Playbook but it restarted several times already without any reasons. I hope the next update will solve this issue of restarting by itself. Also takes very long to startup. I think i could have spent a bit more and bought the Sony Android. On the other hand, the internet sharing from a Blackberry BIS service is very nice feature."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "The hardware for this tablet is probably the best that you'll find in this price range. Equipped with two HD cameras, 16 gigs and more of storage, and a gig of ram, it's fast and reliable. The HD display is wonderful. The OS is intuitive and quickly mastered. The web browser is one of the best I've seen on a mobile device, although it could use a few improvements.\n\nThis product does has its share of downsides to it. While the OS is great, it's also pointless as there are only a few apps created for it. While the newer versions do have a way to add android apps, it's needlessly complicated for the average users as such additions need to be downloaded to PC, converted into bar file, and then uploaded to the Playbook using another downloaded and installed program.\n\nThe Kobo e-book store has lots of great books, but no where near at many as you could get with the Amazon Kindle (yet another app with no official presence on the Playbook) or Kindle Fire.\n\nThe Video Store has such a lack of movies that it's ridiculous. Also, you can buy episodes for the few tv series that they have, but you can't buy the whole series for some reason. All in all, if you do get this product, you'd be better off watching movies or tv with the web browser, which works fine with Amazion's Instant Video.\n\nThe video chat for the device only allows chats with other playbook owners (as far as I can tell) and the lack of apps to make up for this really hurts. To connect to the internet without Wi-Fi I've just found out that you can tether the playbook to non blackberry phones!\n\nOverall, I'd have to say that while the Hardware is the best and OS is well written, the fact that it isn't very android compatible or better yet, an android based OS hurts the Playbook's future prospects badly. If you're looking for something more mainstream, you'll need to look elsewhere. Hopefully the creators of the Playbook will change the OS to make it easier to add android apps or better yet, just write an android OS for the Playbook, (as I don't see many developers switching over to a system that only works with blackberry products).\n\nThere are a lot of other things about the Playbook, both Good and Bad and is well worth the money (starting at around $200.00 for the 16gig) . I'll leave you here by saying that while I'm happy with it, that I'm also going to be getting another brand of tablet. Take that any way that you please..."}

We had tried a couple of other tablets but found them slow and hard to manuever through the windows/apps.  We can't get over the vibrant clarity of the videos and pics plus the audio is phenomenal. The speed is faster than my laptop with DSL.  It is little difficult to click on some of the commands on a 7\" screen with your finger, we are hoping a stylus will help.  The internal keyboard is a good size and easy to type on.  Still learning what all this tablet can do.  I don't have a Blackbery phone but now I want to get one so we can bridge them.

You can hardly find anything worthy to download to your tablet . It's sharp 5m pix camera and 3m pix front face camera can only be used between playbook users .

And don't be confused with all of the apps in BlackBerry app world. I checked this out before buying the PlayBook but found out later that most only work on the phones and not the PlayBook. I don't know why BlackBerry can't make their phone apps play on PlayBook. They need more mainstream apps! This is worth $200 but it is not an I-Pad.  If they get more apps this will be an awesome tablet."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I have to say up front that this is one impressive little piece of hardware!!  It appears to be very solidly built, has outstanding display graphics and great battery life.  The user interface (once you grasp a few of the basic swipes) is very strait forward and intuitive.  It is easy to use and very well laid out.  My wife has an Ipad and it compares very favorably to that device.  However with most computing devices the available software has a dramatic effect on the perceived performance.  There is a lot of good basic software that comes with the device however the available apps could use a little work.  I would think that maybe Blackberry might offer some incentives to developers to make some more attractive apps.  The GPS engine works ok however the Bing Maps program they have saddled it with, times out before the GPS has the opportunity to initialize for the first time.  Technical support is dismal and there is little or no information included with the unit.  It would be reasonable for Blackberry to post some sort of on line Manual, on their website, that would be helpful (don't you guys have any info in house !!!).  I found that on line forums had solutions to problems that the Tech Support folks could not fix.  It shares some of the common problems of most tablets running bare bones apps.  Email is a bit doggy in that there is no way to block spam and often eMails will be received two or three times.  And like the iPad this wireless device can not print to a wireless printer on the same wireless network (What is up wit that?  My lap top and Net Book can!).\n\nLikes -  Size , Graphics, Battery Life, Build quality, Intuitive interface and Web Browsing capabilities.\n\nDislikes - Tech Support, Lack of printing capability, Modest APP selection, Slow initial Boot Up, Weak Email program, no online manual.\n\nOn the positive side they do seem to take the feed back business seriously.  I received a call shortly after I completed my feed back survey and they actually did seem to care!\n\nThis could be a totally awesome device with just a few good moves on Blackberrys part !!\n\nUpdate\nJust got done reading the\"Blackberry Playbook Companion\" by Matthew Miller.  After reading this book (biased on the original OS) it was obvious that the original device was highly dependent on the Blackberry Smart Phone to take advantage of many of its features.  That would explain why it received a rather luke warm reception by many non Blackberry users.  The latest OS Revision eliminated this dependance and makes this a very competitive tablet.\n\nOnce the use of Android apps if refined to embrace the concept of \"User Friendly\" this will be a truly awesome tablet.  As it is my wife has an Ipad and there are many features of the Playbook  that I find are much better!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Being a faithful blackberry user before someone decided the coin \"smartphone\" can give you kind of an idea that i've been waiting for the PlayBook. I've never given up on RIM because in reality its more likely the competing companies that aren't \"ready\". Nobody dares to give this company ANY credit for any breakthroughs they've made within the hardware division. Sure, they didn't invent texting but they sure came up with an idea to make it a whole lot easier. Being able to write notes, keep a schedule and a calender with you at all times. Apple has achieved at basically taking over your entire life, creating hardware/ software compatibility issues so great that i refused to buy into the sham beyond the iPod Touch 1g. I would rather have a Zune which everyone knows is no longer alive. the iPhone and iPad quietly but surely followed the iPods footsteps. Now starting with the iPad, it's a rather nice device but we the consumer took a heavily under-devolped piece of equipment and somehow turned it into the holy grail. If it wasn't for Apples grand marketing scheme, which might i add RIM refrained from for years and was still a VERY successful company, alot of people would still have no idea what apple would actually have to offer today. I know more people that have cut their ties with iOS and Android, either to find a new found love for Blackberry or even downgrade to a non-smartphone device altogether! Now that's how you do it!! Are these companies truly that horrible? Let's see, iOS unique UI, horrible compatibilty issues. Android?, terrible UI totally dependent on the hardware. Phone, Tablet or Media Player, SAME ISSUE!\nNow to be fair i don't hate Apple or Google, but i can honestly say i do not like any of their mobile products. //REVIEW HERE>> (OS2.0)With that being said the playbook is amazing companion to any owner of a blackberry device thats capable of BB-Bridge or anybody looking for a solid tablet that isn't worried about being \"connected\" 24/7. Since i was never a HUGE fan of mobile gaming, the lack of solid games on my bb phone was never an issue, an issue that is no longer being ignored within the world of PlayBook. There are more console quality games available for the playbook than you probably have time to play. Online multiplayer a HUGE bonus for most Gameloft titles, more on that later. The device itself is a solid piece of hardware, very sturdy and feels good and secure when you're holding it. Someone said the buttons were an issue but i can fully agree with that. The button scheme is no different than a iOS/ Android tablet, plus they even added dedicated media buttons, PLUS! The screen is nice and crisp, very detailed. when it comes to media, its no different than any other device with a screen, it all depends on the source. i wouldnt recommend anything under 720p, you get the same effect as if you were watching a analog signal on a HDtv. pro compressed 720p files look just as good as FullHD, you can search the web on how to achieve that. And in response to the complaints made against the screen, i feel they are useless. If you want superior clarity, maybe you should look into 30in. or 50in. tablets(the PlayBook has a miniHDMI port to connect to flat panel monitor or tv). The touchscreen is super responsive and most will not encounter problems just using their fingers, but i have found it more productive to also have a stylus handy and use both. the homescreen works well in portrait and landscapes, let me say that while using some apps it might be a good idea to \"lock\" orientation due to the sensitivity. As most reviews have stated the browser is awesome, being able to run flash as you would on a desktop/laptop, ex. YouTube videos play directly inside the browser with the option of expanding to full screen view. Adobe Reader and Docs To Go are built in and work flawlessly. PressReader works like a charm. The Music Store is powered by 7digital and it rivals any music service out there. the facebook and twitter apps are okay for the lightest of users, but thats okay with me. Most of us use 3rd party apps anyway. Now on to the Android app player, its perfect for expanding the playbook into new territory. The apps that have been ported and accepted work well, 50% of sideloaded apps work but it can be quite a task to set up for most basic users .The games flow really well from Modern Combat 2 & Asphalt 6 show quality that are on par with Playstation 2 and Xbox. the ability to change the control schemes are a major plus in my book. Alot of voice overs breaks away the average mobile phone gaming, it puts you in the game. Would like blackberry develop a 1st party bluetooth controller or at least license one. The sound is one of the main strong points on the playbook, hoping that the source is properly mastered and not over compressed. For mp3s i would stay around 160kbps VBR for the best quality:storage ratio. The PlayBook has stereo speakers, and while listening to quality mastered files the PlayBook speakers create sort of a sweetspot. It has some low/mid freq definition but nothing below kick drum range, but what more can you expect? It might not be a bose sound system but its far from tinny sounding, it has life. The OFFICIAL accessories are a complete line up, rapid chargers, rapid charging dock, bluetooth stereo gateway, a mini keyboard. Add that to a bunch of other licensed 3rd party accessories and you have quite a few to pick and choose from. No sd slot, no prob when you have a 32gb or 64gb model. I have almost 10gb of apps alone so a 16gb model would of been a bad choice for me. But not a bad choice for someone who wants a superior web browser/media player/ ereader(the 16gb model is the same price as the kindle fire might i add) OVERALL the Playbook is showing strong signs of promise for people who would of never thought RIM would budge on security issues. If youve been wondering about buying a playBook and haven't done so by now, do it. The price alone should be a selling point."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "This is my first tablet, I am an engineer working in a pretty professional environment, just to let you know about me.  I like my gadgets, have too many, but have slowed down on Gadget Acquisition greatly in the past decade.  My wife has an iPad 2, so those are the only two tablets I have much experience with.\n\nI love the Playbook.  For me it far exceeds the iPad in just almost every way.  I like the smaller form, I can carry it all over, hold it with one hand and use it that way.  My wife (and I honestly) get a tired wrist pretty quick trying to hold the iPad with one hand and use it with the other.  I have the 64Gig set up and paid hundreds less than my wife's 16GB Apple.  The OS on the playbook seems far superior in most ways over the Apple.  It just feels better, looks better.  The build quality is great, as is the Apple's.  The screen is better (don't know about the New iPad), the swiping motions just feel more natural.  I like the browser on the Playbook better and it integrates well with my work functions and BB phone (which I can use to bridge my Playbook and phone to have internet access when on the road, at no additional cost).  I can set up the Playbook to connect wirelessly to my PC to transfer files and videos easily.  Overall for my 40% work, 60% personal use it is a brilliant unit.  Trust me, I am not much of a RIM fan, never wanted a BB phone, but work provides it for free, and I am not that thrilled with my phone vs my wife's iPhone.  So when I say it just works better and more smoothly, it's not Rah Rah RIM guy.\n\nThe beef on not enough apps....personally I don't get it.  Yes Apple has over 500,000.  So what, you will use 0.1% of them.  The playbook has just about everything I have ever looked for in an app, nothing I want I don't have and some are pretty amazing.  So maybe the choices are a bit more limited, but it has never affected my ability to use it.  The only two things I would slightly like are Netflix (which I cut way back on when they upped their price last year) and Word With Frineds (which I play on my iPod, but wish worked better on my Playbook running through FB).  So if those define your use criteria, than maybe the PB is not for you.\n\nNow there are just some things the iPad is better at.  10-inches is just more.  Some web surfing is easier to read and push links, no question about it.  And reading technical PDF's is a bit better, so yes, some things the iPad are better at clearly.  My wife prefers the iPad, but she has the phone and the iPad is very similar, so she is comfortable with it.  Honestly, both are nice units, it's up to the person to determine his needs and budget.  I tell my friends the PB is like a mini computer and the iPad is like a giant iPhone.  All I can say is I made the right choice and having 64GB at this price is a steal, already my wife is having to make decisions on what to put on the tablet and what to keep on her phone only due to storage size.\n\n If hesitating due to the feeling that it is a crippled tablet, or does not run well, or has Zero useful apps, you can dispel those thoughts.  If you like your iPhone, want to use a tablet more as a fun giant iPhone, have lots more money and don't mind the extra size and weight, than go with the iPad.  Honestly, kinda glad my household has both, but if we lost them both, I would get the PB again in a heartbeat.\n\nUpdate 7-25-13 - Its been over a year since I bought my playbook and honestly, I just purchased my second one.  Ok, before you laugh, hear me out.  I paid onefifty for a 64GB unit with a desktop cradle.  Think about that.  I know, the platform is orphaned and waiting to die, but it really is a very nice, very well made unit that I still enjoy using.  I purchased the 2nd unit to mostly be my MP3 player for my stereo.  Think of this as a 64GB iPod with GPS, Accelerometer, a much bigger screen, decent camera, HDMI output for watching movies on screens for hundreds less than a tiny iPod.  Accessories for this unit are dirt cheap as they empty the warehouses, cases, chargers etc..pennies on the dollar.  So for storing music, movies, photos, Bluetooth, email, web browsing and overall value this thing is awesome.  The apps are perfectly good for my use, but the second tablet is not going to be used for that.  Adding music and files is so simple, just drag and drop into a folder structure that I can make sense of from my desktop (what can I say, just not a fan of iTunes).  My work has supplied me with a top of the line 64GB iPad recently, and yes I like some parts of it better, but you know what, I still like many things more about the playbook and use it just as much for personal and travel use. I have my original one right now in the desk cradle streaming music, easy to navigate the channels and doesn't take up much space like the full ipad would.  Anyway, for me, it was a great purchase, and honestly the price will most likely go lower, I just wanted to pick one up before they are gone."}

This has to be my FAVOURITE feature.. so ingenious! I own an ipod touch, now i find myself swiping on that screen. lol\n\nTRUE MULTITASKER: beauty about this tablet, you can run one application and simply swipe across to get to the other without stopping the first one.. pretty cool. I haven't seen any lag on it, i have gotten up to 9 applications going at the same time and it still didn't slow down.\n\nBRIDGE: If you own a Blackberry smartphone, it will skyrocket the PB into more awesomeness. With the Bridge function, you can connect your phone with the playbook and use the phone's data plan to surf the internet on the playbook. Big help if there's no wifi around. You can also see a lot of information that's on the phone on the playbook. you can use BB messenger, memopad, calendar, messages (emails) on the playbook.\n\nFULL BROWSER WITH FLASH SUPPORT: when browsing, all flash material comes through just like you would on a computer. My mother is able to even check her farmville on it when she's in bed. Though it is laggy, but it will do the job.\n\nMEDIA\n- CAMERA: 3 MP forward facing, 5 MP rear; both capture Full HD 1080p video. you can get some beautiful photos and video. the mics are crisp and clear and loud.\n\n- SPEAKERS: 2 speakers on top of either ends of the tablet. They are nice and loud.\n\n- DISPLAY: 1024 x 600-pixel resolution. for the size of the tablet, videos looks great. very sharp and crisp\n\nFUTURE OS: I'm pretty sure BB10 operating system will come to the playbook which will just make the playbook a whole new device again... as i witnessed with Playbook OS 2.0\n\nCONS:\n\nAPPS: In truth, the Blackberry Appworld doesnt have a big apps market like the others have. But many times, the browser does well to access the website. (other tablets create apps because they don't have the flash support and isn't able to use the full website on it)\nThere is no Netflix nor Skype app available, though there are apps that try to get around that. As far as i know, Netflix will not get to the Playbook neither. These don't affect me much because i don't have a netflix subscription and i don't use Skype.\nSome apps on the PB also tend to be a bit more pricey in comparison. The appstore is growing though so this con may do a turnaround at some point.\n\nWEIGHT: For it's size, it's kinda heavy and you can feel it in your hands after a bit. (especially when reading)\n\nOverall, I love the PB, i find more uses for it everyday. I find most people who complain about and sully the good name of the playbook didn't do their research... Take heed of what you're buying..  because if you want netflix and skype and a bunch of apps...dont get it and begin to complain that it doesnt have it."}

Then they issued the new OS .358 \"upgrade.\" Now it won't sideload as Windows Vista can't find the drivers. 20 hours on the internet and five hours with Blackberry tech support to no avail. And you know I'm not the only person having issues since .358. We shouldn't have to go through this, Research In Motion should have thoroughly tested the new \"upgrade\" before issuing it -- and the \"upgrade\" is mandatory. Worse, they don't even provide the drivers for it on their website. I mean even the cheapest mouse on the market you can get the drivers for it. Up until .358 I would have given the Playbook 4 ****, one * off for not having download capacity with common sites such as Amazon and Barnes & Noble. But now it's practically useless to me except for surfing the net and playing video games downloaded from Blackberry Apps. So now, I have to give it 1 * mainly as an portable internet device. I am furious at RIM for screwing the pooch on this one. The only thing I can say is that if you have the money, buy the iPad."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "The Blackberry Tablet is an OK Tablet if you need to use a Blackberry for Work email and want a larger format to view and communicate with email using a larger touch screen keyboard than using the small buttons on the Blackberry Phone.  The browser works fairly well - WiFi connections are OK.  Bluetooth connections are sporatic - with the phone.\n\nThe Phone must be close to the playbook to use the Blackberry Bridge feature - which is nice if you are on a train or in a car commuting to/from work (not the driver).  But the connection sometimes stops or doesn't connect.\n\nThe Screen is AWESOME - probably the best feature.\n\nOverall OK - it only cost $199....so, I'm not unhappy, just wish the performance was better and the bugs were fixed."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "At $499, the BB playbook is a total rip off! But at $199, you should definitely buy it. Why?\n\nPROS:\n1) The screen is superb. Good resolution with nice bright colors\n2) The camera is good as well, both front and back\n3) It is gesture-based and quite cool for me who is used to android and ios only\n4) It looks great, how it minimizes its apps. Makes it easy to transition between apps.\n5) The body has a nice solid-feel. The matte texture feel of the  back is nice too\n6) Has decent preinstalled apps/games\n\nCONS:\n1) Limited apps/games. Most apps are paid, very few ones are free\n2) Camera has no flash (but not a big deal for me)\n3) No native twitter app. Browser only\n4) The bezel is just too thick for my taste but I can get over it\n5) Hangs once in a while and had to reboot to get it working\n6) Reboot time is quite long, a lot longer than android/ios\n\nIn conclusion, despite having equal number of pros and cons, this is still a great buy and I still recommend it for those who wants to use they tabs for social media, videos and emails. But if you're a gamer, might not be the perfect tablet for you. But if you're quite a techie, you can install an android emulator for android games to work on it. I'm afraid to do that, so I'm not taking the risk."}

It says you can get android apps, but they just put SOME android apps on the blackberry app world and they are more expensive than what they are on amazon. I have had it almost a month now and when I go into certain apps it freezes the screen and only shows 1/4 of the app and the rest of the screen is black. When you exit out of that app and try to go into another one it does the same thing, you have to restart it in order to fix it.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I just bought the playbook today and so far it is not bad. I am actually writing this review on the playbook, which is no problem because of the flash support.\n\nLet's start with getting browser, it is one of the best on any mobile device, ithink that safari is the worst browser, it usually takes a few seconds longer go load webpage over a wifi connection than on an Android phone. And this with flash which according to apple slows down a device. The playbook browser is quite fast, not as fast as windows 8. Pages are displayed almost perfect, sometimes objects are a little off, notice big though. Pinch to zoom is really smooth.\n\nThe screen is really good,HD videos look really clear and colourfull.\n\nThe email client is one of the best.\n\nThe notification is kind of cool, when a new email comes in, first a little red dot starts glowing in the upper left corner of the screen, and then can swipe down to see the notification, though it's not necessary to pull down a bar over the entire screen. The notification maybe takes up ten percent of the screen\n\nI had a little problems with the setup, when he agreement loaded I couldn't swipe so you. Had to restart after this everything was running.\n\nApps are of course not really available. The most popular ones are there.\n\nMultitasking is on the same level as android and very smooth and productive.\n\nTo sum up,\n\nIf u one of us Americans who like to be actually able to get some work done and don't like to ducked into apple's ecosystem, where u have to buy apps to get some basic functionality and prefer to use windows then this is the device for if you don't want an android tablet. This device is aimed at business and professionals, if u just want to check some mails and want to use a lot of apps then get another devicd\n\nThe biggest drawback for the blackberry playbook is the not available kindle app.\n\nUPDATE\n\nNow after a few days of use i would only give 1-2 stars, the not availability of apps is just killing the device. Sideloading can't be counted in, considering that it is technically illegal(you take apps licensed for android and then put them on the playbook, a device not covered in most apps terms of agreement).\n\nAnd the LONG charging times are just awful, it takes 4 hours to charge 40%? basically 10% per hour, that's 10 hours for a full charge, which means it's not really usable day-to-day."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I had to post this to due to the negative reviews.  RIM has no plans to ditch the Playbook according to their new CEO on April 10th, 2012.  I also read that Microsoft and Nokia had discussed a joint bid to buy RIM out.  But, RIM knows that they have what the other two companies can not readily do for themselves...a solid enterprise customer base for their smartphones worldwide and a professional grade tablet that rivals the iPad in terms of power, screen resolution, interface, sound quality, build quality, and much more. Like other reviewers, I for one am glad I no longer need to use the button on the bottom of the Apple products I own. The browser on the Playbook is so much better than Safari on the iPad.  RIM needs to market the Playbook better, but it's kind of hard when the Kindles have, for as long as I can remember, been on Amazon's front page (i.e Amazon owns the Kindles).  New apps are coming out regularly.  And, I can just as easily bookmark my most-used websites as icons on the Playbook's main screen or on the browser's main screen.  Plus the iPad is just big...I'd rather carry my small laptop, which has a larger keyboard, around.  My iPad would be collecting dust if it is not being used by my kids for games and Netflix right now because I'm now carrying my iPhone and the smaller Playbook for regular use.  If Apple provides a smaller tablet with a better browser, this may change.  But, that's not in Apple's plans right now. And, it would take a 3rd or 4th generation Amazon Kindle Fire to even catch up to the power that the BlackBerry Playbook has for professional use. Since I focus on more work oriented tasks, the solid professional build quality, the sharp screen resolution, and smoking speed of the Playbook multitasking abilities and is exactly what I'm looking for."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I am 30 yr old and also have been a blackberry smartphone user since 2007. I was so glad when the BB PB was released because I had tried other touchscreen smartphones thinking that I would join the touchscreen revolution. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with each one. The BlackBerry PB offers so much along with the stability of it's operating system. I decided to write this review because of I'm fed up with the online articles and reviews from people who aren't BlackBerry smartphone users. It was obvious when BB designed the PB they had their current users in mind and they also had in mind the future capabilities of the operating system and how both the phone and tablet would work together. BB has always been for the business professional and not about games. And I'm cool with that because I get things done with it. And if I want to play games or let my children play games the BB PB app store offers enough game apps to satisfy (many of the android apps are now available) So let's go down the line,\n1.)I love that it bridges seamlessly with my smartphones files, contacts, calendar, messages, BBM, tasks and memos. If I add or make changes on either device it's automatically updated on the other.\n2.)I can't say enough about the sharp high definition screen. The size of the PB some would see as a negative but I deem it a plus. It fits anywhere and when held in the vertical or horizontal position typing is done with ease. But if that isn't enough for a BB phone user, now you can type using your BB smartphone keypad. Yes, no need to purchase accessory keypad.\n3.)Also, there is no need to purchase an additional Internet plan through a mobile provider due to the Wifi and bridge capabilities. When you can't access a Wifi connection, no worries it bridges through your BB smartphone browser (no addt'l charges)Although I have the option to purchase a tethering plan I have no need.\n4. For presentations... This connects to most displays and tvs and renders hi-def picture quality every time. And your able to use your BB smartphone as the remote control for presentations from anywhere in the room. My son and I have played the NFS undercover race car game with it connected to our HDtv and I must say it was really cool. The tablet is the steering wheel. And it's the perfect size.\n5. Unlike other tablets and pads, PB has flash capabilities. PB has adobe reader for PDF which was lacking with my smartphone unless I buy it from the app store. So that's awesome.\n6.)Ability to transfer and buy music to PB, create, edit and download word, excel, and powerpoint files, chat with PB users, print to go feature, social apps message integration, camera and video, access to any of my BB smartphone files, and the list goes on and on.\n7.) the battery life is great. Sometimes I can get a full 2-3 days out of a full charge. and it charges quickly on the charger that is provided with it.\n\nI almost forgot I downloaded the Kobo ebook reader. And I'm always reading books on my playbook and I also have Kobo on my desktop if I want to read my books on a much larger screen when I'm home.\n\n I've had my PB for about 5 months and I'm still finding new capabilities everyday. I bought a new desktop a couple months ago. And because the PB does so much I may only use my desktop once or twice in a week. I am more than pleased with this purchase. If I were you don't let the discounted price fool you into thinking this isn't a great quality product. I purchased the 16g from radioshack at $199 and later a 64g directly from BB $299.\n\nIf you don't own a BB smartphone, I think you will be pleased with it's functionality but you will get the most out of it if you are a BB owner. And unfortunately there is so many people struck on a product that creates products that force their user have to purchase new hardware every few months or so without any discounts. And what do you know? they conveniently have a new product being released just in time. But if the consumers don't see it, all I can say is more power to that mega company. I can only hope they will wake up before it's too late.\n\n(this review is being posted via youngentreprenuer's playbook)"}

Battery life is not quite as good as my Asus, but I get a good six hours of use off of one full charge.\nI really believe that this unit will especially appeal to Blackberry phone users.\nI do have a concern that RIM has not done very well with the Playbook, and that they might abandon it\nin the future, which means long term negatives for Playbook owners. The potential for how the Playbook and Blackberry phone could integrate in the future, is an exciting proposition, however this may not come to fruition. RIM has given Playbook owners very little confidence that they plan to stay in the market with the Playbook. There are quite a few rumors surfacing but none seem to give Playbook owners much confidence. Rim should come out and tell us what the future of the Playbook is, as it's unfair to those of us who are backing them by purchasing the Playbook.\nI think RIM has created a great product but has not marketed it very well.\nBlackberry should not compete with Apple. Instead, they should do what they started out doing with their smart phones, marketing the Playbook to people who want the best functionality in business.\n\nLast but not least, I got my playbook for $199.00 well below the original price.\nI would recommend this tablet highly.  My only reservation is whether RIM will be sticking with it.\n\nUPDATE:  Today I learned that the in next OS update (2.1) Rim will no longer allow Playbook owners to sideload apps. This is after they bragged about introducing this feature months ago. They sure don't know how to keep friends. I have down graded my rating on this item, given that company support and progress is a determining factor when rating products."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "This BB PB tablet is the best valued tablet out there.  There are so many things to like about this tablet from a hardware perspective, audio quality, cameras, speed, screen, HDMI, etc. that it is hard to pan it for that.  Unfortunately this crowded field with Samsung and Apple going for the first position, it is hard for any tablet company to create a high valued masterpiece.  If you want to pay $500 - $800 for a tablet, be my guest, and you will get all the marketing you want.  But if you want a 'functional and high valued' device dollar for dollar, I believe you have found it.  The hardware alone is worth $350, seriously, and the software is, well, improving.......  There is really no software I am wanting, and believe me, I am demanding on that topic....But between Android and BB software, who needs 5 file managers and 4 drawing programs anyway to say this has a great application base....I am very happy with this device, and I can't think of anything it can't do for business or as a pleasure device!!!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I bought this back in February used and was in great condition, except for the one dead pixel but they allow a certain amount in all screens so I guess I just got unlucky getting one with a dead pixel, its annoying. As soon as I got it I loved the form, weight, feel, and texture of the back casing. The screen is beautiful (aside from the dead pixel) very crisp and 7\" is fine for me, very portable and practical. The main reason I bought it was I wanted a tablet very badly and couldn't afford any ipads or good androids so when I saw the 16gb Playbook available for $200 I couldn't pass it up. It serves its purpose, is very portable, and is capable of most of what a laptop can do. The first major problem was that I noticed it will not work on ad hoc networks which is a problem for me because I use my friends wifi and share it from my laptop to devices in my room. I was able to use a program called Connectify which can create access points which the Playbook can connect to so I was able to use it at my house that way, and I use a Mac in school and the Playbook is compatible with a Mac's version of internet sharing. The next problem was I noticed a piece of dust somehow got under the screen, I kept it in the sleeve (now in a case), clean it often yet the piece of dust is close to the dead pixel and makes that part of the screen annoying to look at, over time I have noticed other pieces of dust getting under the glass somehow and can't be blown out. Doesn't make any sense to me, my 4 year old ipod touch is in my lint filled pockets everyday and there isn't a single piece of dust under the glass on it. The operating system is very fast and has full flash and multitasking. 2.0 is nice but I think more can be done, it still takes way to long to boot up, uses nearly 500mb of ram without any apps running and the android player sometimes crashes. The ram is a problem to me, I thought 1gb would be fine but nearly half is always used by the os, so that degrades the potential of multitasking because only so many apps can be run at once. The browser is the biggest hog. One of the problems I had was trying to dig for an old post on the browser facebook and running out of ram and the page just froze, I was hoping it would just get rid of the top of the page and keep loading where I scrolling down to, luckily since 2.0 I haven't had that problem so it must have been fixed. I'm not very impressed with the battery life, I'd say I'd be lucky to get 5 or maybe 6 hours. It needs charged every day (charging is rather fast atleast.) Note, I always have bluetooth off and turn wifi off when in standby and after using it for about 2 hours in school it needs charged when I get home or I won't have enough to use it for the rest of the day. Plus it looses battery life overnight, every morning its down between 5-10% from where it was before I went to bed which is garbage because my ipod touch can last over a month in standby. I'd shut it off but with the terrible boot time I just deal with the nightly drain. The last problem is App World. It has gotten better since 2.0 but still needs many more apps, lacks a lot of big apps on ipad and android, however there are a few good android apps being ported over. Over time I have found the productivity and utility apps I needed so now I'm satisfyed with what I have, but you aren't overwhelmed with many choices like you are in the app store. (This can be both good and bad.) A lot of good apps cost money and I don't have a credit card and as far as I know they don't make app world cars like itunes prepaid cars so I won't be able to buy any apps. I know I stated a lot of the problems but I just wanted to tell you what I don't like about the Playbook, thats it. There is much good to it, I use it everyday in school, its very portable and I like the form factor. The cameras are excellent, among the best, especially the 2mp for a front camera is going above and beyond. I appreciate the flash browser, adobe reader, and the file browsing ability with both the os browser and air browser. It feels more like a \"my computer\" being able to get that access to your devices files, and using that you can delete songs on the device, unlike the ipod. I like the blackberry desktop software for your computer, I've only used it once but I like how it's set up. It was a great idea to put the speakers on the front and they sound great. The bezel gestures is the best idea yet I've seen on a tablet and it works very well. I don't have a BB phone so I can't tell you about the bridge but the newly added email, contacts, and calendar apps are very nice. Most of my email accounts work fine but for some reason my earthlink won't work, I tried everything and used the same addresses and ports that it uses on my windows mail. I guess earthlink just isn't supported but it isn't a big deal. The volume and play buttons are nice and have different functions if you hold them down which is nice. Of course the flush mounted, tiny power button was a terrible idea and needs pressed very hard, and if you don't have a case on it you'll need to use your nail to even be able to push it down. Luckily the touch gestures can be used to wake the device and while it's on on the taskbar you can put it in standby. I have RIM's convertible case on it and it fits perfectly, looks very sharp and professional, is comfortable, and functions as a nice stand with multiple angles and ways to hold it. Although it does have its issues and disappointments I use it everyday and its a very good deal for the price and I can say it's the best 7\" tablet out there as of now. The Playbook won't be replacing my laptop and I plan on getting a quad core 10 inch android or iPad in the future but if you're on a budget or just want a full featured 7\" tablet the Playbook is the way to go.\n\n**Update 5/31**\nFor the last several weeks my Playbook no longer charges and now no longer syncs to my laptop. I charge it daily since the battery sucks (I take great care of the thing) and one day it just did't charge. I tried it both while on and off and the charge icon won't show up on the battery. It must make contact though because if I plug it in while the screen is sleeping it will wake it. It still had been syncing to my laptop (and that was how I had to charge it too which is extremely slow that way) over the USB cable to my laptop. Then my laptop os crashed and I had to reinstall windows, since then I put the desktop manager and desktop software back on my laptop and even though it detects the playbook is connected it can't connect it and won't show up in my computer as a storage device. And I have the latest Tablet OS and managers on my laptop. So now I'm unable to charge it and unable to back it up to try wiping it. I can't tell if it is a software problem or a hardware problem, since it wakes up the screen when I plug it into the wall and when connected to my laptop it says it's connected on the Playbook even though it won't show up on my laptop. Does anyone else have this problem. I'd contact RIM but the 90 warranty is over and I will NOT pay RIM anymore money for a repair or shipping for this piece of garbage that keeps causing me problems. I liked the device (aside from the mentioned problems) but after this I will never buy another Blackberry device again.\n\n**Update 6/12**\nFrom reading the reviews on here I have figured out it is indeed a hardware problem (miniUSB port) which I was gentle with so it was just poorly designed. The battery totally died and it won't even charge off of my laptop now. Yes I can buy the rapid charger (which in the future I will) but I need the USB connection for backups and sharing media. So I will need to get it repaired, since the warranty has expired and I'm sick of RIM's careless efforts on really perfecting what could have been a great device I'd much rather not deal with them and just take it to best buy or something if it can be done cheaper and quicker. I want to get it fixed but when I have the extra money I'm just going to decide on an iPad or Android and keep this as a backup and a smaller, more portable one. I will definitely stay away from any future Blackberry purchases."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "People who have prior use of android tablets, be advised that Blackberry has it own operating system . Android Market, 1Mobile Market or other markets (are just that) other markets and will not currently work with this line : Blackberry Playbook. In using this tablet there are many strengths and few bummers. The strengths are its well made parts, great screen resolution, superb sound that is front facing you with excellent sound quality. The bummer is the tiny power button, no HDMI built in, however it does accept most mini connectors to your HDMI TV, AND ! when connected to your HDTV performs well.  The APPS available through Blackberry are good, but you have to search through each category and try them out. The overall experience as well as the many free app's, utilities, TV programs (English and French) are good. Sound is far more superb than most tablets, image quality far superior. The power button is small and hard to access, there is the s-l-o-w-e-s-t start up ever for a tablet, and takes what seems to be a seriously delayed start up.  Some nice things are that when online, making purchases, you can instantly take a picture of anything you are experiencing simply by pressing the top arrow keys together at the same time located next to the power button.. this sends any image then to your pictures.\nThe other odd thing is that you cannot upgrade the tablet with a micro SD card, but 16MB of built in flash is good. Another annoyance is to charge the tablet all connections are on the bottom of the tablet (rather than the sides) which can lead to the tablet wanting to fall from surfaces.  The Pro's certainly outweigh the Con's for this nice tablet that is like no other."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "The playbook has worked well for business trips to Europe and US instead of a packing a laptop -- it simplifies reading long html mail, web surfing, and reviewing ppts and word docs.  Another great feature is using the free bridge software and my company blackberry phone to gain access to intranet secure web pages that weren't feasible on a phone. For some the ability to output to a HD tv for showing presentations may be of value but I have only watched videos I shot on a tv using the micro HDMI port.  I have tested the use of my bridged phone as a remote control for a ppt slideshow and cursor control and it works nicely.\n\nFor home use the playbook has been the main diversion on many play dates where filming movies and watching them is a popular game.  The small form factor makes it easy for even a six year old to run around and capture action shots like a pro (it's survived being dropped a few times).  On vacations it fits in the same camera bag along with my 35mm SLR so it's very easy to bring along. Of course the good games like Angry Birds and Need for Speed come in handy too.\n\n-sent from my playbook\n\nPS - I'm a Ph. D. Computer Science not an MD"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I watched lots of YouTube vids, and read reviews on the 'PlayBook' before buying. This is the BEST 7\" tablet on the market currently! I simply cannot believe how powerful and smooth the dual core processor and O.S. is, and how quickly the full screen web pages (like your PC, with 'Flash') load. Love love LOVE the web browser and 'desktop' main screen. The front firing stereo speakers and audio are great as well. And the high density graphics, camera, and 1080p HD video (with much better audio quality than iPAD) is 'to die for'. This thing even has a built in gyro for game control too. I also have found more than enough apps to suit my interests. The value factor of this excellent tablet is 'off the scale' as well, and portability is fantastic. If I could only find 1 fault with it (and this is true of many tablets), it's that the battery is not user-serviceable or replaceable. If RIM and other tablet makers would manufacture tablets with pop-out, user replaceable batteries, they would triple their sales. I would hate to think that I have to toss this gem of a tablet out in 2 or 3 years if the battery stops holding a charge, which often happens with today's electronics. In summation, RIM would sell tons more of these great tablets if only consumers know about it! Maybe they should hire VW's admen and run a catchy TV ad campaign!\n\nUPDATE June 2015:  My PlayBook NO LONGER WORKS!  It simply does not turn on or off, and it is FROZEN!  I am EXTREMELY pisssed off about this, given the fact that I have a lot of photos, vids, and other key information on this PlayBook!  It was reliable at first, but I did NOT expect this to happen!  I have read of many other instances of this happening to other PlayBook owners.  R.I.M. obviously released a defectively engineered product, and they should compensate all buyers of this device!  I 'babied' mine, kept it in a temp controlled environment, and used it only about once a month.  Despite minimal use and a well taken care of device, it failed!  I had to downgrade this product from 5 stars down to 1 star.  Shameful!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Being able to tether to my BB phone was the key to my decision to buy this tablet.  Consider it a free tablet after a couple of months.  I have unlimited data on my phone plan and being able to access the internet without additional charges pays for the Playbook after only a couple of months.  I have seen instances of data being slowed, but only in high use areas.  I only have 3G so I consider this pretty good.  I'm not a big app user.  I have seen some apps written for the ipad or android that I want.  I'm often put off that more android apps haven't yet migrated to the playbook or that android apps do not load transparently to the Playbook.  BB does a great job insuring security, but they need to speed up the app approval process.  The only area that has frustrated me in using the internet is that some, not all, drop down menus do not work on the playbook.  Hopefully, this will be resolved soon.  The above reasons are the only items that keep me from giving it five stars.  Movies are easily downloaded from my pc and I find the screen size decent for watching while flying.  The images are excellent.  The camera works great, but a way to mount the Playbook while recording video would be a very nice upgrade or accessory."}

In terms of build quality, it is solid.  you have this metal shelf feeling once you hold on to it.\n\nHowever, it seems the apps is worse than HP TouchPad.  I use it mainly to read email, browse the web, track stocks and watch youtube.\n\nLet's start with my worst experience, the YouTube.  The layout seems ok, until you start do a search on video.  It cannot find video that exist when using web browser.  I am talking about the browser on BB.  That's pointless, right?  it is not just one instance.  It happens a lot.  So, I end up using the browser to go to YouTube .  Secondly, the \"related\" video and the authors link feature doesn't work!!  So, after you watch one video, and wants to find the related video or author button.  It just won't allow you to do it.  Even WebOS is better, what is this?\n\nSecond main comment is the lack of good stocks, options tracking software.  It isn't hard to program.  Since RIMM is targeting business users, they should include more finance related good apps.\n\nThird, the screen and video quality is not as good as HP TouchPad.  the pixel density seems less.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I'm a medical professional, have an iPad1 and iPad2, and use Windows and Mac extensively.  24 hours ago, I decided to purchase the Blackberry Playbook.  In 24 hours, I've discovered the Playbook with the current OS2.0 is a hidden gem in this crowded field of tablets, and in this Apple-frenzied society.\n\nPlaybook when it was launched in April 2011, did not fare well because the OS was not good.  In Feb 2012, it has upgraded the OS to 2.0, incorporating the functions they should have incorporated in the first place.  Had they done so, the tablet marketplace may be quite different now in 2012.\n\nWhen the New iPad came out in March 2012, I looked at the marketing.  \"Retina Display\" required all my apps from iPad2 to be upgraded to use the new display.  The upgraded apps have ballooned in size, such that my 32G iPad2 (only 3 months old) has less storage for media.  As much as I've been an Apple supporter in the past, the planned obsolescence with a new iPad coming out every year, means the product life will be only two years before one has to upgrade.  In this case, as apps continually need to be upgraded, and upgraded apps take up more and more room in the iPad, I will be forced to upgrade my iPad every two years because the 32G of today will no longer be enough in two years.\n\nEnter the Blackberry Playbook.  Hardware is ahead of its times.  Since 2011, the display has been superior to iPad, with 1080p resolution; the speakers are stereo, there are ports for USB and HDMI, and it comes with front and rear cameras.  Now with OS2.0, it's functionality is comparable, if not superior in some respects, to the iPad ecosystem.\n\n\"Browser\" is fast, shows thumbnails of each webpage, and supports Flash.  The built-in \"Messages\" app will take care of multiple e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn accounts all from one app.  Built-in Bluetooth allows for internet tethering to your mobile phone (if your phone supports it), so you don't need a separate dataplan for this tablet.  Those that use Blackberry can also use the Bluetooth to \"bridge\" to the Blackberry phone.  It comes with \"DocsToGo\" which allows you to create \".DOC\" and \".XLS\" natively; \"PrintToGo\" allows your computer (PC or Mac) to send files wirelessly to the Playbook, without having to use iCloud or Dropbox.\n\nI put the Playbook OS2.0 through its paces, and found it multi-tasks better than iPad (even with iOS5), so you can run apps in the background while performing other tasks in the foreground.\n\nOne deficiency is that the Blackberry Playbook OS2.0 does not have native international language input support.  Apple definitely is ahead in this regard, at this moment in time, unless Blackberry rolls that out with the next OS upgrade.\n\nPlaybook uses the entire surface - the display, the bezel - for gesture control.  iPad only uses the display portion for gesture control.\n\nThe smaller form factor of the Playbook makes it easy to hold for a long time, for reading, or for web surfing.  The built-in HDMI allows you to plug it into a TV, without having to purchase an AppleTV for $99 or  an Apple Digital AV adapter for $39.\n\nThe video and sound from the Playbook beats the iPad2; I haven't compared it to the New iPad.\n\nThe New iPad 16G is $499, 32G is $599, and 64G is $699 (these prices are for the Wi-Fi only models)\n\niPad2, 16G is $399 (Wi-Fi only); Apple no longer sells any larger memory sizes for iPad2.\n\nBlackberry Playbook is (as of this writing), 16G for $199, 32G for $249, and 64G for $299.  And if you need 3G or 4G, you can tether it to your smartphone via Bluetooth.\n\nThough Blackberry AppWorld has > 60,000 apps versus Apple's >500,000, what the typical consumer uses a tablet for, can be easily satisfied with the number of apps currently available in either app stores.  Granted, Apple has more variety (including their interactive textbooks), and more selection.  However, most people use the tablet to read ebooks, surf the web, perhaps video-conference, watch YouTube or downloaded/purchased video.  Considering the increased memory usage of the New iPad's \"Retina Display\", and the increased size of new apps designed to use the new display, there will be less storage available for media that use the higher resolution.\n\nIf the consumer is vested in the Apple ecosystem, it would make sense to continue paying for the iPads.  Do be prepared for iPad obsolescence after two years.\n\nIf the consumer can look beyond the sexiness of the \"Apple\" brand, and were to look at what we truly use a tablet for, the Blackberry Playbook is a clear winner.\n\nJust be prepared though... the packaging inside the Playbook's box, is not as sexy or sleek as that of Apple products.  I've kept my Apple boxes over the years.  Looking at the stack on my shelf, I'm realizing I've been paying a premium for those nice Apple boxes.\n\n( I do not own any stocks in RIM or in Apple )"}

But if you want to stay connected to the internet, easily manage with your emails, read pdfs, and edit your MS Office files, then the Playbook is the right tablet to choose.\n\nBasically, what the Playbook does, it does very well.  It is faster and multi-tasks better than any of the tablets, including the ipad.  Plus I think the screen looks more brilliant than the competitors.  At first I was worried with the small screen size, but actually the compactness is really slick and it is large enough where I don't struggle seeing everything.\n\nIt seems that RIM is on a slippery slope right now, but I think if more people viewed this thing as a cool tool for getting work done rather than a wannabe toy, the Playbook would be much more successful.  Approach this thing with the right expectations, and you will be more than impressed.  For your handheld gaming experience, buy a Nintendo 3DS. :)\n\nPS: If you can get the Bluetooth keyboard w/ case, I highly recommend it.  I was surprised with how effective the combined touchscreen/keyboard approach can be."}

The tablet is really powerful, never lags, applications start pretty quickly.  App world is growing, it's not the best just yet but I've yet to not find an app to do what I needed at the time.  Battery life is good, it varies based on what you're using the tablet for - games drain it a lot faster than just watching a video, but that is normal of all tablets.  I usually charge it once every two or three days, with moderate use.\n\nMy fiancee and I have been using it a LOT to help plan our wedding, from having photos with us, having a mobile browser to check prices, to our google docs files, using camera to take pictures for reference, keeping notes etc.  It's been a life saver for us.\n\nThe web browsing is great on wifi, and if you have a Blackberry phone it is even more useful because you can use the bridge software and you can piggy back off of your phone's internet connection for no cost.  There is of course tethering and wifi hotspot features you can use if you don't have a Blackberry but I don't have any personal experience with that.\n\nI'd highly recommend it, and at this price you honestly can't beat it."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I bought a Playbook after comparing it to all the other 7 inch devices out there. It had the specs to stand up to all those very well and the multitasking is great. I kept it for a week and finally just decided it did not work for me. Here are just a few issues. Browser - nice browser, but no \"find on page\" feature so I can find words. Youtube Client - you can log in, but there is no way to see your playlists, favorites, etc. So, what's the point. You have to use the m.youtube.com, which I found liked to crash a lot for some reason when I tried to full screen a video. The desktop Youtube worked really well though. Android Apps - ok, there are some out there, but they're not that great to navigate. Combining the gesture navigation of the Playbook with the menu navigation of certain Android apps just proved frustrating to me. Alot of them performed noticeably sluggish also. One of my favorite apps is Flixter, which is a converted Android app in Blackberry App World. They conveniently left out the ability to view all movie trailers in the app. I'm pretty sure they did this because of the time it would take for a full port of the app, but c'mon man!! When I said forget it and tried to find a native Playbook app similar to Flixter, there was nothing to be found except crap from other countries...Brazil, India, etc. C'mon man. This is just an example. There are some good Android ports that work well like Pulse. I sideloaded Kindle and it worked well, but a little sluggish. Dropbox was another app I sideloaded that worked well. One problem I found with it was that when I went to view photos it downloaded every photo I viewed to my device and kept it there. I didn't really like that. The BlueBox app (native Playbook app for Dropbox) worked well, but in order to view any document it had to first be downloaded to the device. This is not what I'm used to on other devices. The camera is okay, but once I take a picture I can't share it or go directly to the gallery from the camera app. Maybe I'm too used to the features of my phone or other devices I've used, but I bet you can do this on a Blackberry phone. Why leave out simple stuff like that on your tablet. OS 2.0 added a whole lot, but it's still got a ways to go. I think they need to find that balance between gesturing and menu navigation. There is such a thing as too much gesturing. Just like Palm and the TouchPad, the Playbook is too little, too late. It needs support. Android apps won't save it (real good apps, but it's not getting those quick enough and I'm not waiting). This thing needs great native apps to make it shine. A couple kudos, though...this thing plays movies like a champ and games look great. Just goes to show you that specs aren't everything."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "By far, the playbook has the best specs in the $200 range tablets you can find. No other tablet in this price range even comes CLOSE to what the playbook has inside it's well developed frame. I've owned a lot of tablets and nothing can even compare to the playbook in aspects of hardware.\n\nSo why the 3 stars?\n\nSimple, the total lack of apps. Sure it had great specs on paper but without the app to support it, it's pretty useless. Let's face it, the majority of people who get tablets are looking to it as a tiny entertainment center on the go or at home. Sure, RIM's App World has some apps but most of them are not useful to your every day users. I'm not speaking for everyone here since this is my own review but I find the lack of apps really depressing. I loved this tablet, best tablet I've owned so far but it was just missing something about it. It's like if you built a robot and you add parts to it so it can do anything but you forget to add the software for it to function and just doesn't do anything at all. I know OS 2.0 promises to add android apps but it all depends on the developers to think if it's even worth creating or porting apps over to the Playbook. Call me an app whore or an app-digger but once this guys gets more apps in it, I'll be glad to take it back."}

Screen clarity - it's beautiful, similar to the Kindle Fire which is crystal clear and better than Samsung Galaxy Tab.\n\n3.  Apps - it is so easy to \"sideload\" Kindle and Words with Friends or any non-native apps.  There's step by step instructions all over the web, it's quick, and works great.  There are also many native apps.  For those who complain that there's not enough apps, I can't imagine what they feel is missing.\n\n4.  Email - loaded with the 2.0 update and works great.\n\n5.

I have a blackberry w bes connecting to my company's outlook (email, contacts, task, calendar). I love the BB bridge which via bluetooth, allows the Playbook to access my bb's email, contacts, task, calendar, as if I were looking right at the BB phone handset. So when a message comes to my work email or my personal email, it will be transferred by bes to my handset. As long as the playbook is within a short distance and w bluetooth connection turned on, the message then appears on my playbook. So cool. The nice thing about this bridge, is when the bluetooth connection is lost/shutdown then nothing is left on the playbook. Nice and secure.\n\nI tried Droid phone before with Good for the enterprise App, only for 2 days before I sold the samsung S2 and went back to blackberry 9810. Good for the enterprise app is no where near the functionality of BB BES. for example, you cannot use any market app with the contacts & email & calendar (no task is transferred) of the Good for the enterprise app. You are forced to have 2 separated contacts list : one for the outlook at work and one for your personal. Too much details to handle for me. Secondly, the contacts on the Good app is sorted by first name, so if you have a family with smith as last name, their contacts will be sorted by first name and not together as smith, john & smith, linda. For a large outlook contacts, that first name sort is just a big hassle.\n\nI finally bought 2 playbooks, 1 w 64 GB for me and 32 GB for my daughter. Price has dropped to a very affordable $200.\n\nScreen is bright and clear. As usual the quality built of BB devices is paramount. PB feels solid but not to heavy and big like 9 or 10 in device.\n\nBy the way, the browser works so far with every thing i threw at at.

You can access items on your laptop, home, or office PC on the tablet via the Internet (ORB).  PPT presentation (presentation mode) is spectacular.  You can connect to VGA projectors (additional accessories necessary).  It does everything for a person who needs to get things done.\n\nThere's some talk about the power button being too small.  I disagree.  It's actually well placed and sized to avoid accidental on/off.\n\nI purchased the 16GB, as I figured I wouldn't use it that often.  It is now my go-to computer and I have found myself loading more and more items I need on the machine.  I wish I had purchased the large drive. However, given the FTP program and the ability to access files on other computers, this probably won't be an issue.\n\nCons:\n-No Skype (there is an available program, but not seamless)\n-APP marketplace still slow going - APPS are a bit pricey.\n\nI am incredibly impressed with this machine.  If you're like me, I think you'll find it very useful."}

Bought this off amazon and immediately tried to turn it on and it wouldn't work. Called support, they told me to let it charge overnight. Did that, still wouldn't turn on. Plugged it into the computer and updated to OS2, that finally worked. So, to get it to a point of where I could register the dang thing, it took me about a day and a half. I wasted about 2-3 hours searching crackberry forums for other issues that came up as well with just the installation part. Tried to register it and it kept freezing and would not allow me to type in correctly. Maybe I just bought a \"dud\" but, I did a fair amount of research before purchasing and thought I got a decent product. However, through the process of trying to get it work, I was exposed to way too many problems that were going on with the tablet. Just wasn't worth it. I sent it back to amazon and now have a Samsung Galaxy 7.0. which I am very happy with. Took it out of the box and worked instantly and now i have access to droid app market, netflix, and an awesome tablet that does all the work I need it to do."}

Not only is blackberry app world lacking in polished applications, but most of what is offered costs 99 cents and up. No skype or any of the popular FREE apps available for android or Apple and NO NETFLIX!!!!!! You can't even watch in the browser because there is no silverlight support. Don't be fooled by the reviews that say \"it now has android support\". This means nothing because you are limited by blackberry's weak application offerings....there is no android market here.\n\nI spent $199 for this and it doesn't get much use (my ipad gets used often). Battery life sucks with the playbook (3 hours max) and my tablet arrived with one green stuck pixel which looks lovely on a black background.\n\nThe browser does play flash well however flash enabled sites often become tiresome to navigate because of the limited screen space and tiny controls. An example of this would be zillow.com. Try pinch, zoom, and scroll without opening advertisements or other content. Unless you have dainty hands it's impossible. Another reason applications are important, so the user can easily control what they are trying to accomplish.\n\nThis review comes post install of the 2.0 update which has been waited for with bated breath by many and was suppose to \"change everything\" in terms of this tablet's usability (or lack thereof). With the 2.0 update you get a native mail app and buggy \"android support\". Pretty insulting for my $200 dollar investment.\n\nThe volume (sound volume) rocker on top of the device lags horribly. Push the up or down buttons to change the loudness, and the effect happens 5-6 seconds later, along with a volume slider bar that appears on screen. You either end up turning the volume way too high or way too soft because of this.\n\nThe OS software on the playbook takes about 3 or 4 minutes to boot up. Quite possibly the longest boot times in mainstream computing history. Reminds me of the old days with windoze 98 on an i386.\n\nThese are my observations about the device based on my usage, and in comparison to the iPad/iOS and Android powered tablets (of which I also own). Some people seem giddy with excitement about the playbook while others are in my camp of disappointment  (based on review readings here and elsewhere) so your mileage may very based on your level of standards, and whether or not you are a RIM fanboy or employee (the not-so-good reviews for this device are trolled by such people if you look closely)\n\nI have no allegiance to any device or company but this thing was clearly rushed to market. Lovely colors, smooth swiping, and 1080p mean nothing if utility is lacking. Software wise it's a joke, an expensive joke on ME. You can decide if the bargain basement price is enough to make the same mistake.\n\nIf blackberry can fix the battery life and volume control with another update and give me Skype and Netflix for F R E E (don't nickel and dime me with your app world!!!!) then I'll change my review to 4 stars. The hardware has promise, The software as of today (even after the long awaited v2.0) does not.\n\nHINT: F R E E GPS software, to take advantage of the unutilized GPS capabilities of the playbook would get 5 stars. Why not sweeten the deal for those who do not want to play games like asphalt 6 and moden combat 2, of which you are also giving away."}

It seemed quick with every move, quite fun. Great pictures & video when taken in good lighting, but they took away \"close up\" and another option for picture taking when they started the OS updating.\n\nThe down side and deal killer from day one was the battery drain. Sometimes I would leave it in standby mode for 10 hrs or more and have 2% drain. But then in standby mode for an hour or two and it would drain over 10%, and that was with NO wifi or ANY programs running, period! With light or moderate usage I was only getting 3 hours max, which of course ment \"something just aint right here you-all\". Also the wifi would turn on by itself. Tried the reload more than once but still showed the same bugginess along with other oddities.\n\nWith relentless research of crackberry forums and any where else, no matter what I tweaked, it wouldn't change for the better. BlackBerry tech support tried but nothing we did resolved the issue, and so per their recomendation I needed to return it. Only had it for a couple weeks and enjoyed everything I did with it. Would really like to grab another playbook but don't want to go vendor to vendor hoping \"this ones not a lemon, hurray!\" but that's just plain silly and unnecessarry.\n\nI'm thinking there must be a disgruntle employee at the BlackBerry factory from all that I've read and researched. Sherlock Holmes might have concurred as well. For everyone else who got lucky with theirs, enjoy! \"Ride it till the wheels fall off\" as they say."}

With so many different tablet flooding the market we took our time to research, and after reading up on the playbook, knowing that it's a blackberry product, and having some hands on time with it at BestBuy, we went with the 32gb playbook.  Now we have several computers at home connected to our router, even my new LG TV and Xbox are both wireless and connected.  But our wireless at home has always seemed much slower, but not with the playbook.  It loads pages quick, the OS is easy and simple, and it's just a solid tablet.  But since my wife and I have blackberry's for work, being able to bridge the playbook to your phone is great, and allows for your playbook to have access to web through your phone while on the road.  And that is one thing that seperates this tablet from the rest to me, as we don't need to have a specific 3g plan.  Now the playbook is much smaller than the IPAD, but it's an easy hold in your hand, even for our kids.  Graphics on the screen are great, you can't go wrong."}

So far, I found it is a great, solid, reliable machine with a very smooth OS.  There are room for improvement.  1.  Rename and order bookmarks.  2.  Access to files easier.

During the initial start-up and subsequent setup, this device froze twice.  Only a third restart got me to the software/firmware update 2.0. and that in itself was laboriously slow to complete.\n\nOnce going, only a handful of built-n apps opened.  Others froze or were very slow.  I performed a \"security\" sweep twice (which deletes all data and re-insetalls the original OS; however, it also then upgrades to 2.0 which again repeats that long process, and I encountered the same previous problems.\n\nWi-fi worked well, the screen is decent, and the build quality is better than average and the device feels very substantial.\n\nThe PlayBook was a fail for me. Apps froze, wouldn't open, or just plain felt not yet ready for prime time.  The Print-to-go app was a disaster and would not work at all telling me I wasn't connected to the internet.  I was connected at full strength.\n\nSeemingly, from reading the other reviews here, I must have gotten a lemon, but decided not to try another Playbook.  I hope your luck fares better than mine."}

But it fits what I'm looking for perfectly so I'm glad either way.  I bought this Playbook for my dad to get him away from my desktop.  I chose the Playbook because it was one of the cheaper tablet options and all I needed was a good browser run on wi-fi for my dad who only checks his email and reads the news (but does so all waking hours on my computer).\nPackaging is minimal, which I like, being the tree-hugger that I am.  There's a USB cord, a power cord, some warranty/product booklets.  It comes with a small pouch and a wiping cloth to keep the device free from dust, which is a pleasant bonus I didn't expect; these things never came with accessories before.  I only tested it out a bit since I've just picked it up today from Best Buy.  So far the browser has been great.  It loads fast, and is pretty intuitive.  The one thing I don't like is the inability to rename my browser bookmarks even though I'm running on the new OS 2.  Why not, RIM?  That's the most basic thing.  I don't see why they would include the option for bookmarks on the home screen but not within the browser.\nOther than that, I hope this thing lasts so my dad will let me get my computer back."}

I bought the PlaayBook before the OS 2 was released.  After about two weeks, I decided that most negative comments I found were on the mark.  It would definitely take some get used to.  One of the more annoying problem was the Browser closed without any warning.\nThen the OS 2 release, I upgraded the PlayBook.  Things changes dramatically, it is like I had two totally different machines.  The browser now is much stable (still had 1 crash after OS2).  All the apps are smooth (except one).  The Documents to GO can read and edit my Excel files withour any issues.  Apps may still lacking, but I bought the tablet to do a few things: 1. Surf the Net; 2. Read my stories in PDF (they were Word files); 3. Photo show; 4.  Play MP3s; 5. Play videos; 6. as an appointment book (OS 2 comes with an excellent calendar app); 7. As an address book; 8. Play some games.\nThe tablet was meant to be my travel item (I am tired of bringing my 7 lb Dell).\nNow, the bad - As I said the Documents to Go is a great app., but my PlayBook could not start the presentation part (like PowerPoint), everytime I tried, it gave me an \"Internal Error Code\".  I contacted BlackBerry, and they acknowledged receiving my support request, it is now 4 days later, I still only get 2 of the 3 functions of Documents to Go.\nIf I can ignore this issue, i could easily give the PlayBook a 4.5 stars, simply because the Tablet is well built, and with OS2, it can compete with everything on the market.  You just cannot find another 64 GM tablet at $300."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "My standard greeting to my Blackberry Playbook is, in deference to Bob and Doug McKenzie, \"How's it going eh?\"  Turn it on and you're transported, quite leisurely I must say, to an outpost somewhere between Lac De La Pointe and Galoot Lake.  A new owner finds out quickly that the Playbook is a proudly Canadian device. And that's kind of cool. No pun intended. Why? The supplied apps are Canadian-centric! Like the Film Board of Canada video app, Kobe bookstore or the ING.ca banking app in App World. Eh?\n\nResearch in Motion is pedaling hard right now. We all know that.  Android and iOS rule the roost with Microsoft threatening to move Windows into position that might someday translate into a reasonable tablet. In the meanwhile, RIM's foot is stuck on the railroad tracks hoping some RCMP Mounties in the form of a Pandora or Skype can rescue it before the train arrives.\n\nAnd while the Mounties may, indeed show up, I'm betting they'll be in the form of independent players, Pandora SDK in hand, hunkered down in a cabin on the shore of Chaleur Bay in a flannel shirt hoping to get an app into the market that can stop the train. In the meanwhile, based on the recent RIM leadership shakeup and much needed Playbook upgrade to QNX 2.0, I think that the train is still very far away.\n\nI now have two of these $199 Canadian slabs sitting before me. One for me, one for my wife.  So for less than the price of one 10\" 8GB iPad, I have two 7\" 16GB Playbooks complete with USB, Bluetooth and HDMI support - connectivity features that, while unimportant to Apple in the era of `The Cloud', are important to me and lots of others.\n\nFrom a hardware standpoint, the Playbook is a lot of kit. When compared to a similarly priced Amazon Kindle Fire or the new 8GB B&N Nook Tablet, just the connectivity features alone clearly give value-added benefits to the Playbook. Being a lazy writer, I'll spare you the rundown of the specs but I'll just say that this thing is solid. Really solid. Battleship solid. A bit heavy for small hands solid. And, with its metal chassis, a little cold too. If you like to cuddle up in the bedroom with your tablet perched on your mid-section, a B&N Color Nook tab might be more comfortable. However, if you appreciate survivability, this thing is tough. But lacking Gorilla Glass, not that tough.\n\nA while ago I had the agony of owning an awful HTC Droid Eris running Android 2.1. While I'm not comparing apples to oranges or phones to tablets, I am calling out Google for the lack of stewardship of its Android OS by letting the phone manufacturers and carriers have their way with it and generally turn it into a fragmented, insecure cheeseball of an OS. It's so out of control with fragmentation and OEM customization that it reminds me of current day Las Vegas after the Mob lost control of the casinos. It's an overblown OS while Apple's iOS looks like it was designed by a New-Age artist at a Yanni concert.  I have a Windows Phone 7 which I think is the most usable mobile OS available. Looking closely at QNX, I saw that it was designed in the same spirit of OS usability, purity and security as old WebOS or Windows Phone 7.\n\nSo let's talk about that operating system, QNX. A while back when HP was dumping their tablets for $99 bucks, having WebOS rather than Android or iOS was seen as a compromise to be made for the pleasure of scoring a nice albeit cheap tablet. What is sad is that WebOS is a very good OS. It's the same for Playbook's QNX. A very nice, secure and fast tablet environment bereft of malware and Android security fears. Using it gives you the impression that you are dealing with an extension of the quality build of the device's hardware. With the upgrade to 2.0, all of the previous dumb RIM management decisions melt away and you're gifted with a highly-functional tablet experience that doesn't need a Blackberry phone to provide integrated email and PIM features. In fact, QNX 2.0 gives the Playbook the smooth, effortless and snappy feel that is lacking in the Amazon Kindle Fire for the same money.\n\nReading to this point, you'd think I'm really sold on our new Blackberry Playbooks. Well I'm certainly not going to put them in the box and send them back, but I have one serious concern that would have prevented me from buying the pair had they not been such a deal at $199 each.  Lack of apps.\n\nNow I refer you to back to my second paragraph. The section where I expect a Canadian Mountie in the form of a big player like Pandora or Skype to pull stuck RIM off the tracks before the train comes. Having business tools like Documents To Go is great, but it's not enough. Pandora says no. Skype is waiting to see if it's worth their while. But some like Zinio who see the promise of small but growing market are jumping in.\n\nLacks of app was an issue with Windows Phone 7, and the outcry for Pandora was met by Indy developers creating SDK-based apps like MetroRadio to fill the hole. I think this is where Blackberry needs to be very proactive in supporting and fostering independent developer interest in Playbook and QNX. Just the ability to use some Android apps doesn't cut it. I've loaded a few. Feh. Playbook-native, quality apps built by RIM-supported developers are the only way to go to make RIM a true contender for your tablet-dollars.\n\nI'm keeping my Playbook. My wife hasn't put hers down since she got it, so I think she is too. But proactively I've put both Google and Bing on news alerts looking for Blackberry Playbook announcements. I'm reading Crackberry.com every day. So for now, the apps I have along with the great WebKit browser are satisfactory. But without a rapidly growing App World inventory, the future will be dim indeed.\n\nI have faith that the freight train heading for RIM will either derail or turn back before insuring a tragic and unnecessary ending to a great Canadian company. Do you hear a whistle in the distance? I sure hope not."}

I preferred a 7\" tablet as a compromise between portability and usability.  The most common complaints about the Playbook were the power button being too small or too hard to operate and the \"lack of apps\". I found both of these complaints to be unfounded.  The power button is easily pressed without any head scratching, frustration or need for a sharp object.  As for apps, there are far more than I expected.  Many hundreds, mostly either free or ranging up to $1.99.  There are a few that are more expensive, including Angry Birds at $4.99.  One small complaint that I hadn't seen documented is the longish boot time.  It takes my playbook about a minute and a half from button press to ready to use.

Wrapping your hand around this corner to hold Playbook, as I like to do, reduces WiFi signal strength a lot (a bar or two, factor of x100 or 20 dbm), which can be the difference between getting online or not when traveling. A simple trick to get good WiFi reception while still holding Playbook with the left hand is just flip the Playbook over so the 'Blackberry' logo is on top. This puts the most commonly used 2.4 Ghz WiFi antenna on the right.\n\nCheck out the 'SANOXY Bluethooth Keyboard for iPad'. It's a very inexpensive bluetooth keyboard that works fine with Playbook.\n---------------\n  7\" screen size is fine, sharp as a tack (viewed with reading lens of bifocals), bright and colorful, sound good, screen responsive to touch. Swipes easy to learn.\n\nOn browser homepage\n  On my desktop browsers I have all my frequently visited links in a single custom .html file that I set as my homepage. To me a custom .html homepage is essential, it makes bouncing around the web fast and easy. I first tried copying my custom .html file into the 'Document' folder, but found it was not visible under 'Document' icon, but later going backdoor I got it installed as the browser homepage. Here's the procedure:\n\nType into browser:  file:///accounts/1000/shared\n(note 3 ///)\n\nThis brings up a simple file manager that allows you to see what files are in memory and even to launch them. In the Document folder was my custom html homepage file, which I had earlier copied over via USB. Tapping the filename loaded it into the browser, and holding my finger on it allowed me to copy the filename (via the copy box). Finally going into the browser settings I was able to paste the filename into the homepage window. Now every time I start the browser up comes my custom homepage.\n\nAnother neat trick is to have alternate start links for the browser on your home screen. This is done by clicking the star+ button and selecting add to home screen. For example I have a icon that will start the browser at the New York Times and another for local radar.\n\nOn media files\nMP3 files can simply be copied over and will play. Video files are more difficult. I have a library of captured .flv files and captured TV shows in .ts format, some of which I would like to put on the Playbook to view when out of WiFi range. However, neither of these file formats is supported directly on the Playbook. In principle there are two options: copy over the file and use an app that does on the fly conversion, or two, preconvert the file to a supported format (like .avi or .mp4). I experimented with both.\n\n  There are several apps that claim to allow you to play .flv files on Playbook. I bought one for $0.99 and while it played .flv files, it was not clean (position slider did not work). I tried a couple of converter programs, which you run on your desktop before downloading. The best (by far) was Freemake Video Converter, not only is it free, but it's simple to use and will convert a batch of files in one shot. I found it shrank the file size of .ts files, which are initially quite large, by roughly x3 and expanded the size of .flv files, which are initially small, by roughly x2.\n-------------\nupdate\n  My tests show HD (1080p) videos taken by Playbook are quite large, about 6 Gbyte/hour. I found running them through Freemake Video Converter with NO change in resolution, file type, or video quality reduced file size to 2 Gbyte/hour, a factor of 3. Very handy if you want to keep lot of Playbook video stored on the Playbook.\n-------------\nBefore converting a lot of files I did several tests comparing file formats and resolution. Freemake Video Converter makes it easy to reduce file size by lowering resolution. Tests with a sharp HD video showed no difference that I could see between 1080p and 720p on this small screen, so I decided to go with 720p. This resolution reduces .ts file size by a factor of 4. Reducing quality to TV level, still very watchable, reduces .ts file size by a factor of six.\n\nQuick tests of various formats (avi, mp4, wmv) showed no significant difference in quality or file size and all seemed to play fine on Playbook, so I choose avi and began converting. This turned out to be a mistake. Not one of the first three converted TV shows (1 hr) would play correctly on Playbook. One refused to open and other two gave an error when the slider was moved, though all played correctly on my desktop. The only reason I can come up with is that Playbook has a problem with long files in avi format. My quick tests had been with short files. I then noticed that it says in the Blackberry document, 'Supported Media Types on Blackberry Tablets', avi. wmv, and mp4 are \"supported\", but the \"recommended video format for local playback\" is mp4. So I reconverted the same three TV shows to mp4, also lowering the resolution one step to 720p, and now all played fine on Playbook. So my recommendation is stick with mp4, which is the format Playbook uses for its own videos, and reduce resolution to 720p (1280 x 720).\n\nWiFi file transfer\n  A neat trick to easily transfer files to Playbook from your computer over WiFi (no cable!) is to put a shortcut to Playbook on your Windows desktop. Set the 'target' of the shortcut to either the IP of your Playbook (found under About, Network) or the 'Tablet Network Name', which you can change (found under Storage and Sharing, Network properties) preceded by \\\\ (two backslashes). When you click on the shortcut, Explorer opens and Playbook will appear as a Network device. Click the Media folder and you now have access to all Playbook media folders. For this to work the Playbook 'WiFi Sharing' setting (in Storage and Sharing) needs to be ON. Transfer rate is a little slower than with a USB cable (about half), but perfectly usable.\n(update) For some non-transfer operations, like file rename, I find USB more reliable than WiFi.\n\nHtml files, pdf files and File manager\nThe Blackberry (so called) \"File Manager\" doesn't show file details, and critically (for some weird reason) it hides local html files, though it does show local pdf files and allows you to open them. Real file managers are available in App World. A pretty good basic file manager (free) is 'AIR Browser' and better is 'File Browser' (a buck).\n\n'Air Browser' and 'File Browser' provide a way to work with local html files, they show them and will open them in the browser. Once open in the browser local html files work well, all the internal and external links work. I find it frustrating that Blackberry doesn't provide direct support for local html files, because I have a whole library of such files that I want to use on the Playbook.\n\nPrivacy\nA useful app for file privacy is 'File Shield' (buck). It provides a simple way (without passwords!) to hide videos, photos, and documents. In the app directories and individual files can be toggled between private and public. When set to private, files and directories effectively disappear, visible neither to Blackberry applications nor file managers.\n\nBugs and weirdnesses\n  I bought just after OS 2 release and my OS upgraded to 2.0 when my new tablet initialized. Here are the bugs and weirdnesses I have found in a week or so of use.\n\n-- I initally wrote that my volume up/dn buttons had never worked and assumed it was a software bug because I read someone else reported volume buttons stopped working after an upgrade to OS 2.0. See comments where Ronald kindly set me straight.\n-- Video application has a couple of drawbacks, one is no folders. In the pictures application if you organize picture files in subfolders, the opening screen shows only the subfolders. Not so with the video application. You can put videos in subfolders, but the video application still displays all your videos files on the opening screen. Primitive and inconsistent. Even more surprising the video application displays videos (with the formats it supports) regardless of the folder. Put a video in say, Voice folder, and it still shows up under Videos.\n-- The video application provides two display views: Downloaded Videos and Recorded Videos. Videos uploading to the Camera directory are displayed in the Recorded Video view ordered by the file time stamp, so some separation of videos is possible. Videos in the Downloaded Videos view are ordered alphabetically, No other sort appears to be possible.\n-- Document mode of the browser does not work right in portrait orientation (tested with New York Times articles)\n-- a Hotmail text message in browser would not finger expand\n-- Adobe's pdf reader come installed on the Playbook, but it is not well integrated with the browser. When a pdf link in the browser is clicked, instead of just opening the file your only option is to download the file.\n-- 'Power Off' is a built-in Blackberry app with just three power buttons that are the same as under the battery icon. 'StandBy' in the app does not put the tablet to sleep (as it should), it does a ReStart (locking up your machine for two minutes)! You have to wonder just how much testing Blackberry does when a trivial app like this does not work right after a major OS upgrade.\n-- As I discussed above, it appears the video player has a problem with long .avi files, though this format claims to be \"supported\".\n-- With Blackberry emphasis on security it is surprising its OS does not directly provide support the hiding of files.\n-- After a week of use the browser crashed (gray screen) requiring Playbook restart to fix it.\n-- On my 2nd day with Playbook it crashed (it first refused to open files, then it hung with Shutting down splash screen displayed). There is a way to hardware reset the Playbook, equivalent to holding down the power button on Windows desktops, but I had to search the web to find it. It's hold down three of top four buttons (vol up, vol dn and power) for 10-15 sec (or until you see red led). This restored my Playbook to good health with no loss of data. I took off one star (5 => 4) for the volume buttons not working (whoops, see comments) and for a system crash in two days of use."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Typing this review from a playbook. Everything I own is mac, from iphone to macbooks to Apple tv, but I just couldn't justify the enormous price tag for an ipad that's essentially a larger iphone. When I saw the playbook on sale at best buy I was skeptical at first... RIM products have never been on the top of my list since 2005, and I do have an outdated bb bold for work, but after playing with the playbook for 20 minutes I was impressed!  The release of os 2.0 adds both email client and calendars that can be synced from work, school, and Google Calendar makes it very convenient to have on a tablet. Dates on the calendar vary in size depending on how busy you are, making it very convenient for all those busy bodies out there. The browser is the best I've ever used on a tablet, way better than the safari I'm used to on the iphone. Some people complain that loading full web pages on a seven inch screen is too cramped, but I think it's perfect and the flash enabling makes viewing content like YouTube links a breeze. I like it so much that I'm considering getting a blackberry as my next phone! Apple products may be easy to use and convenient, but the playbook made me realize just how much is lacking in the ios platform.  I could never justify paying the exuberant price for the ipad, especially since I don't game much and just wanted a device that can read word documents and connect to the Internet. If you're cross shopping this with the ipad, trust me when I say it's worth it as long as you don't mind the lack of apps (really, most apps on the Apple Store are children's games anyway), the smaller screen, and imo, A far more intuitive interface and web browsing experience. Its made me glad that I shook the Apple disease and realize how much has been missing from their products. If you are a budget minded individuals who needs a device for viewing work documents, emails, schedules, and flash enabled sites, you can't go wrong with the playbook. Oh, and the small buttons up top aren't really a big deal breaker either.  Trust me when I say you'll know when your device is turning on by a nifty feature called the lcd screen...\n\nSome small gripes, but no deal breakers:\n1) currently no netflix or hulu+ support. Can be sided in from android marketplace, but who has the time to figure that out?\n2) no Google maps app. Important for those who do sales and need to keep track of their territory. Instead, uses bing maps which is about as intuitive as a slide rule. Can access Google maps through browser though, so not a big deal\n3) wifi only. Can be tethered via smartphone, but won't tether with an jailbroken iphone\n4) small power button, doesn't take away from the experience as a whole\n\nPros:\n1) calendar syncing and interface\n2) supports virtually any email client, can sync with a corporate blackberry without saving content to the playbook. In the corporate world this is a godsend, since most companies protect their content like bees to a hive.\n3) browser: tabs, flash, quick responsive scrolling\n4) graphic user interface puts ios to shame\n5) document viewing and editing, including power point, pdf, word, etc., wireless printing\n6) price... Think about it. Half the price of an ipad minus useless apps plus better tablet experience?  You'd be nuts or a teenager to pass on this deal\n\nReally very happy with this device. Utterly astounded by the value, and will likely buy a blackberry phone in the future to make better use if the playbook features. I'm sold!!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I have been interested in both versions of the Ipad but I was never willing to pay $500 for one. When the kindle Fire was announced I was excited because I thought it would be a good tablet at a good price but I quickly decided it didn't have the hardware I was looking for. I took a 2nd look at the Playbook after 2.0 was released and decided to take a chance on one even with the harsh reviews. Since I am a Blackberry user the Blackberry Bridge made it even more appealing. I really only have a few complaints....The boot time is completely absurd, by my count about 2 1/2 minutes and apps are lacking but that isn't a deal breaker for me. No tablet is perfect but the way I see it I got 75% an Ipad2 for 40% of the price."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I am very big on researching a product before I buy it, so I definitely wanted to make it a point to write a review on the PlayBook once I got some use out of it.\n\nI am in LOVE with this thing. Ordering it from Amazon made it easier and I felt safer than with any other site, and I think that the price for the 32G PlayBook was cheaper on this site than on BlackBerry's site (which would still charge a good bit for shipping and handling; mine was free. And don't even get me started on the in-store prices that would tax the initial price, which will be close to twice what  you'd find here, to kingdom come.).\n\nWhile some might buy it for the game play, and others may use it for internet and media sharing, some may use it for social networking, others may want to hook up a cable and use it for professional presentations...Whatever your use, the PlayBook has it covered.\n\nThe initial setup WILL require, as stated on the outside of the box, a Wi-Fi connection to update the latest version of the OS (operating system). After that, the features already loaded onto it make it user friendly. It takes you through a tutorial of how to use the swipe feature to make shortcuts and navigate through the programs on the tablet; and don't let that overwhelm you, within 30 or so minutes,  I was already getting the hang of it.\n\nFor all you BlackBerry Users out there, as soon as you have the chance to get into the app world, download BlackBerry Bridge. This nifty little app allows your smartphone and tablet to be connected via bluetooth. You can view files such as pictures, videos, documents, contacts, email that have already been sent to your phone - right from your PlayBook. BB Bridge also allows internet tethering, whether your phone works as a regular hot-spot or if you just want to use your phone's internet (**note, internet usage from internet tethering from your wireless phone must be done through \"bridge browser\" and regular wi-fi usage can be done from selecting a hot spot).\n\nThe cameras are great, they do well with a considerable amount of light and there is no built in flash, but I do believe the quality of the camera makes up for it. The layout is very clean and easy to use. The resolution on the screen is amazing. Youtube can easily be played (and an app comes pre-loaded) and looks great and isn't as laggy as it is on most phones.\n\nFor the gamers out there, I'm not sure how you would feel about a touch screen interface for gaming but it works fine for me. I am much more into puzzle games, but I did recently download (and become addicted to) a couple free action apps I found (Need for Speed, Asphalt Attack, and an FPS called Modern Combat 2: Black Pegasus) run smoothly, have great graphics, awesome sound effects and music, and didn't cost a dime. Whether you're in the middle of a shoot-out, drifting in a race, or battling in a daring game of Tetris, the tablet can still run smoothly while running several apps at a time and most will pause automatically when the window its in is minimized or toggled. Kobo for eBooks comes automatically on it. Free to start up an account, easy downloads, pretty good library of good books. I love this thing. I never leave home without it.\n\nThe only complaints I do have (though admittedly, I haven't been doing as much research for the PlayBook as I have been playing with it) would be that I have difficulty with getting pictures onto my PB from my phone. I know I could go through the process of going to my computer and hooking up the USB cable and doing it the manual way, but it could just be me and my device or devices, it would just be easier to be able to send them using Bluetooth to have without using BB Bridge. There is a video chat app, but it only works with other BB PlayBook users. I did do some research and there are a couple CrackBerry apps that will allow video chat with other PC users as long as they have the program installed. And this isn't a big deal for me, but it could be a deal breaker for some of you, there is no USB or MicroSD card slot on the device. I'm indifferent. I'd rather pick and choose what I wanted onto it from the computer or other device as opposed to having them all stored there. That's definitely subjective.\n\nOverall though, the PlayBook is awesome and I love it. It serves many purposes, it's comfortably sized, some people may complain about the lack of apps because it's not that giant iThing (yes I know the name of it, it simply burns my eyes to see it) but do some research. I've seen some videos about being able to use the Android market in an app but I'm just trying to cover the basics here. AND whether you're extra careful, a little unlucky, or flat out clumsy like I am, and/or especially if you have children, please do make sure to get an Otterbox! AMAZING! It will protect the device and you won't be out of a few hundred bucks...and literally crying over spilled milk!\n\nSorry this is so long, but most of these are questions I had before I purchased that I had to go to several different sources to find out! Hope it helps!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I upgraded from an Ipod 4th generation. I loved using my Ipod, but I got tired reading on the small screen. So I looked to buy a tablet. I didn't want to buy an Ipad because I didn't want to spend that much $$. Plus Ipad was a bit big for my taste. I narrowed it down to two candidates : the Playbook and the Kindle Fire. They cost about the same. The Kindle had access to tons of media from Amazon. The Playbook had better hardware specs. I decided on buying the Playbook and I do not regret it. I owned this thing for a week and I like the Playbook's OS and browsing experience. I mainly wanted a tablet that I can browse the web, and read my emails and it is a far better experience than I had with my little Ipod touch. The extra components on it like hdmi to tv, bluetooth, the two cameras, 1gb RAM, and two loud speakers made it more appealing than the Fire. I know that the Kindle has access to more android apps than the Playbook, but I can live with out it. Plus the news that Netflix will not be supported on the Playbook, its OK with me because I can always watch Netflix on several devices I own."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "application selection has to improve. android compatability a major disappointment because hardly any good android apps have been ported over (netflix just said no playbook support for instance).  otherwise apps run smoothly, multi-tasking is very efficient, blackberry bridge to use 3g data plan is a big plus since no Wi-Fi dependence, speakers are very good, screen display is amazing. size is neutral, sometimes you wish for bigger size like ipad other times its nice to have something more portable. big time potential if and only if, make app selection close to android and iOS. going to developer mode to get native android apps is a nice alternative, but it needs to be more convenient for the average user."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I got this after going through numerous reviews and descriptions. The primary reason for buying it was the promise of android apps. I thought that the OS looks good, and with a choice of apps, it is a steal, considering the hardware. How very wrong i was!\nThe hardware is indeed great for the price. You get 2 cameras, a stunning display, a 1ghz dual core processor and 1 gig of RAM. The OS, for the most part, does a great job of using this hardware potential. So what's the problem?\nApps, as you might have guessed. What use are 2 cameras when you don't even get skype, or any other video chat app, coming to think of it. Yeah, there is the official video chat, but it is works only with playbooks playbook,rendering it more or less useless.\nAppworld is a joke, seriously! I did see a lot of new apps after the release of OS 2.0, but most of them are completely useless. Most look as if devs made them only to get a free playbook. No kindle, no netflix, hulu, no decent note taking app except evernote, not even google maps. What they have, like angry birds, are overpriced. $4.99 for angry birds,really?? It appears that devs are not too interested in making any apps for the playbook. So comparing to iOS or android, the apps selection is ludicrous. Problem is, no improvement is in sight. The android apps were only the ones devs submitted, which does not seem to be a large number.\nThere are some games, but the collection is very limited. The android app player can get temperamental at times. On the plus side, the OS is actually snappy. Closing an app is as easy as it gets. The video and sound quality is pretty good, so is office app.\nIf all you need is a device that you could put in your pocket and use for email, reading and editing word and excel docs and surf the net?( with wifi), this is the device for you. If you want something which can be versatile in use, with a big app selection, look elsewhere. I am waiting for ipad 3 now."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Unfortunately, I feel like this review will fall upon deaf ears. It's worth a try though, to raise awareness on this awesome product.\n\nI'm a mechanical engineer, and whether by training or just personality, I study the crap out of everything I buy. I looked for tablet PCs for my side business of personal coaching for a long time so I wouldn't have to haul around my nice (but large) laptop. The things I needed most were: clean audio/video recording to record coaching sessions, productivity applications (I use lots of Excel tools and keep client files in Word), note taking tools for business and personal use, and a good browsing experience so again I wouldn't have to lug my laptop around everywhere at home either.\n\nDoes the PlayBook provide solutions for those demands? Absolutely.\n\nYou don't need 45,000 apps to have a rich user experience. This was never a gaming device for me, and I don't really understand why so many people are buying tablets just for gaming and browsing. I do own a BlackBerry smartphone, my first one, but I now love the brand, and the PlayBook has so far only enhanced that love. It doesn't even take the Bridge to make it very functional.\n\nThe apps that are available for this (which is expanding now that the Android player inherent in OS 2.0 is out) are powerful. Splashtop Remote Desktop Manager gives me a great option for storing most of my files at home and connecting to it when I need it, and keeping only critical files on either my phone or the tablet itself. The Bridge remote in 2.0 is pretty slick, and I feel like if I ever have to make a presentation in whatever capacity, this will be the tool of choice. Docs to Go is a perfect addition for this product. They work simply, beautifully, and effectively.\n\nMy one complaint is that I clogged up my RAM a few times due to the fact that sometimes when you swipe an app to close it, it doesn't seem to remove it from the memory. Maybe it's been fixed in 2.0, but I just make it a point to check my free memory every so often and if it's low with no apps running I just restart. Hasn't happened since I discovered the issue though, so likely it's fixed or just a bug of some sorts.\n\nOverall, at $500 this is probably still too expensive. Get it for $200-$250 and it crushes the snot out of the Kindle Fire. If you are a professional who needs function over 100,000 apps or games, I believe this is a great product for you."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I got the Playbook several days before the release of OS 2.0, thinking that if the new OS was successful the price might go back up.  I've now installed OS 2.0 and, while it did add some nice features, including many that people had been clamoring for, I'm not sure it's really much better.  That may change as more Android apps become available for it but that's what it'll take.\n\nThat said, even with the original OS it's a very nice tablet.  I use a number of tablets so I'm able to compare them.  This is certainly among the nicer ones in many ways.\n\nThe biggest advantage it has over the rest are the really fine and loud speakers.  It's the only tablet I've seen that's louder than an Ipad and it's a lot louder.  And the sound is a bit clearer and cleaner as well.  This is with the speakers.  I haven't used the earphones yet.  I haven't felt any need.\n\nThe screen is excellent.  It's not the kind of pop-out color saturation the Samsung tablets have but it's a bright, natural looking screen that's as good as any tablet I've used and better than most.  And it's the only screen I've used that's actually okay to use outdoors.  Some can be seen outside, sort of, if you don't mind it looking a bit washed out.  This one, even on a bright sunny day, is easy to read a book on.  They did the screen right.\n\nThe OS is simple and intuitive and everything you need is always right there and never in your way.  It's easier to learn than IOS and easier to use, once learned, than Android.  The problem with the OS is that it's not very customizable.  You can change the wallpaper and put icons where you want them and that's about it.  Even IOS is a bit more customizable.  With OS 2.0 they did add folders but they're large and clumsy while IOS's folders are graceful and the same size as other icons.\n\nI think the changes in OS 2.0 made the interface a little less intuitive than it was, but it's still much more straightforward and easier to use than the rest.  For the non-technical person who doesn't want to spend much time learning the ins and outs of a tablet, this is certainly the best choice.  For the tinkerer (like me) it's still easy to use and I have to be content with that.  They already did a lot of the things I might do, so it might be said to be pre-tinkered. :)\n\nOne pleasant surprise is that it plays every video I've tried to play so far, and I've tried a lot of formats.  it hasn't failed yet.  I was expecting that to be a problem since I use a lot of formats for various things and I thought that until a good Android video player became available it would require me to convert videos.  So far I haven't had to.  It plays them all.\n\nThe quality of the apps has been very good, as have the prices.  Most of the Android and IOS apps aren't available but it's easy enough to find replacements and they've all been just fine.  Installing OS 2.0 caused a few problems with apps but updates have already become available for all the ones I've had problems with and they're all working fine now.  There aren't all that many apps but so far everything I've needed has been there, usually with a few to choose from, and they've all been good.  Hopefully now that Android apps are appearing there won't be any exceptions to that down the road.\n\nOne thing they didn't do and should have with respect to Android apps was make them easy to install from sources other than the Blackberry App world.  The way it works is that developers have to convert them to be run on the Playbook and then upload them to the Blackberry app store for vetting.  That makes it all nice and safe and cozy but the fact is that a lot of my favorite Android apps have been converted by people on the internet and are available for download but there's no simple way to install them.  There is a way that I haven't tried yet but I will, that requires doing things that a lot of non-techie people won't be willing to do.  They should have made it easy to just copy over and install these apps.  The risk, doing this through legitimate sources such as xda-developers, is small.\n\nTransferring content to the Playbook is possible via Wifi from any Windows PC (and probably Mac and Linux as well).  You just turn on the Playbook sharing mode, give it a password if you choose, make note of it's IP address and then open a Windows Explorer window to that IP.  The Explorer window opens on the Playbook and you can simply drag and drop files to it.  This is the easiest way to transfer files that I've seen on any tablet.  It also works in the background.  No special mode is needed for the Playbook.  I've transferred videos while playing a game or watching a video on the Playbook.  This is the first tablet I've seen that takes multi-tasking seriously.\n\nThe web browser is excellent, but so are those on IOS and Android.  Which is the best of those is just a matter of taste.  They're all very good and any advantage one might have is always temporary.  They're really all pretty much the same.  If anything, IOS is a bit behind without Flash but even that's temporary since Flash is going away.\n\nAfter saying all that good stuff about the Playbook I think I'm still faced with the fact that it's kind of in a world of it's own.  It doesn't really mesh with the rest of the world in the many little ways that Android and IOS do.  For the working person who isn't already using a Blackberry phone and working in a Blackberry environment and wants a tablet for utility purposes, this might not be the best choice.  For someone like me who wants it for consuming media and playing an occasional game and browsing the web it's an excellent choice.  I'm retired and a gadget lover and I play with these things and this is certainly going to be among my favorite toys.  If I was still working and I wanted the most useful tablet I think I'd go with IOS or Android.\n\nBarry"}

Want to read and create Word and Excel documents? Included.  Want the best web browser of any tablet? Included.  Want a mouse and keyboard?  If you have a Blackberry phone, it can now function as a mouse and keypad giving you more precise control than any other tablet. I bought this thing because I have a Blackberry phone and it was only $199.99.  The 7\" size is superb saving weight and space--holding this lightweight device is easy even for extended periods. I cannot imagine why anyone would want a larger screen--this one is incredibly readable. I've been using the device for at least a month and rather than reaching for my laptop, I use the Playbook instead.  I'd tried all the other tablets (including iPad) over the past few months and was uninspired by all.  Obviously when the Playbook is selling at a $200 price point it's being sold for far less than manufacturing cost--Blackberry is trying to clear the warehouse of reportedly millions of unsold devices--better buy yours before they're gone or the price increases.  I simply can see no reason to buy an iPad even if it were the same price.  Buy the Playbook and don't look back!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I have had my Playbook for about two weeks and just got the new OS 2 release. The upgrade should defuse many complaints about the product - the native email and calendar features are superb. Some Android apps were ported over to the Playbook App store - altho I have no idea which ones they are. I don't own a Blackberry phone and have no intentions of buying one. I bought this to read email on the go, to have GPS reference (available from App store, need WI-Fi access if you don't have a Phone w/data service) and, hopefully, to be able to read digitized books. So...my biggest complaint is the lack of a feature for reading DRM-protected books. You can get an app that does a nice job on the classics available from Gutenberg, etc., but I can't even download books from my library - at least I haven't figured out how yet. That and the lack of a Netflix interface seem to be the biggest complaints. The suite of apps that comes with the PB provides everything else I need.\n\nTo answer some of the issues raised here - I have no problem with the \"on\" button. I can see how someone with very large fingers might have trouble, but I suspect the eraser end of a pencil would work fine for those who are digitally challenged. And, once you turn it on, there's no need for the button again. It will put itself in standby, and you just swipe the screen to wake it up.  Also, I have no complaints about battery life - it seems OK to me, but i have not had experience with other devices for comparison.\n\nI think RIM could have a real winner here if they can get past the idea of using it to sell more BB phones. I don't think that will happen. If they develop it as a stand alone product with lots of potential, then the PB might get them on the right track again.\n\nQuick update: I have found the Overdrive app that allows me to download library books - so I would add half a star to my rating.\n\nUpdate #2 - also found a website that is converting free Android apps to PB format. I now have a Kindle reader and it works quite well -- occasional freezes, but nothing I can't live with. I miss the Power Off/Standby button that disappeared when I loaded the latest OS upgrade."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I was intrigued by the Playbook. I purchased one knowing that RIM was releasing a major update to the OS. I played around with version 1 for about a week, until the update was available. Let me preface this by saying I would NEVER have paid $500.00 for a 7\" tablet, let alone one that had no PIM apps and a limited app store. Having said that, the basic OS (1.0) was elegant, intuitive and easy to master. The quality of the device is superb. I have an iPad2 (which I love,) and an HP Touchpad (just waiting for a stable Android build, although WebOS is nice. it's not an iPad, but very nice just the same.)\nThe Playbook screen is absolutely stunning both view-wise and maneuverability. It performs quickly, and is built like a tank. The speakers are phenomenal for a small device. Cameras are of great quality, and video is excellent-better than many dedicated digicams.\nNow, with OS Version 2.0, email is great, calendar and contacts are intuitive and handy. The ability to install some android apps, (hopefully many with either devs contributing and/or a good Android Market hack,)and hoping for more, makes this an excellent tablet.\nIt will be complete when some of the chestnuts are available for the PB, e.g. Kindle, (a must) Netflix, etc.\nHad RIM had the equivalent of OS V2.0 at it's introduction, and started pricing @ $249-299.00, (and didn't try to leverage its BBerry phone base,) it would have been a winner from day one. Hopefully with more apps and android compatibility, the perception of this tablet will change. It is an EXCELLENT, extremely elegant, fast and capable device in its own right, RIGHT NOW. A few more apps and you hit the sweet spot!\nNow if I can only use BB Bridge with my Droid Incredible 2...\n\nIncidentally, battery life is teriffic! Just drain it and recharge. I get about 8+ hours.\n\nUPDATE: WHATEVER YOU DO, GO TO THIS SITE AND FOLLOW THE VIDEO DIRECTIONS. IT'S FANTASTIC AND WORKS LIKE A CHARM! FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS PERFECTLY AND YOU WILL BE WELL REWARDED. JUST HAVING KINDLE READER TAKES THE PLAYBOOK TO ANOTHER LEVEL, LET ALONE THE APPS AVAILABLE AND YET TO COME. THEY DID A AMAZING JOB! THIS NEGATES ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, BELIEVE ME! GOOD LUCK!\n\n<...>\n\nUpdate 2: After spending considerable time with this device, I just don't understand some of the negative reviews. If you take just a little time to familiarize yourself with it, you would find that it just may be the best, all-around 7\" tablet out there. (AND, the screen is GORGEOUS!) I suppose people can be impatient, and not want to take just a LITTLE time to find out how great this tablet is. With all the tablets I have owned, this is second to my iPad 2, and I love it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I picked up the Playbook last week and have been using it all week, and here are my thoughts for those who may need some information about it. And as the title states, I am NOT a person who has a career that a tablet would be useful for; I'm not taking business trips, not always on-the-go, etc. I bought this purely as a consumption device for very common leisure tasks.\nFirst, I got it in a Staples in Canada, where they sell the Playbook for 199, 249, and 299 for the 16, 32, and 64 GB respectively. For THAT price it is an absolutely great buy. That said, it definitely has one major drawback; the apps.\nNow I know many people have made the argument that most apps on the Apple Appstore are useless, but the \"App World\" for the Playbook is seriously lacking; there is a limit to the \"quality vs. quantity\" argument.\nSome key apps that are missing that I've found are: Skype, Netflix, Kindle, a proper VNC app, proper todo apps, and of course, email and calendar (though they did say it would come in an update, OS 2.0). Again, I am a casual user; I want to watch movies and shows on this device, and it baffles me that netflix has not developed an app for such a beautiful device. Same applies for all the apps I've mentioned; I can't talk to people on skype without some broken web-browser workaround, I can't read the many books I've bought on kindle, I can't use VNC for remote desktop without some glitchy app, etc.\nIt REALLY is a shame, since everything else about this device is PERFECT. I've never expected the hated Playbook to be this great, but it really is. From the multitasking to the brilliant gestures to switch apps/return to home screen, and the easy to access WIFI/Bluetooth that Apple refuses to put on their device, I am very happy with my purchase. I'd love to give it 5 stars but again, the lack of apps is disappointing. If I could video chat with skype users and actually USE that 2MP camera, I'd be a happy camper."}

Once the new operating system comes out, that should improve, but my main interest in a tablet is the ability to handle Flash and the Playbook is a winner!\n\nUPDATE ON 2/23/12: With the new OS2, the e-mail and calendar functions are very useful. Very few worthwhile Android apps added so far (actually none that I care about). My biggest complaint is that you can't edit or sort the browser bookmarks, but there is a workaround.

I use the Playbook to watch videos downloaded and streamed too. The videos look better on the playbook than they do on any of my computers or TV's. I also love that it has Micro USB and Micro-HDMI so it easily connects the playbook to TV's computers etc.. I also think that it reacts well when I touch it and doesn't seem too slow or tentative. The browser is also pretty good. It comes with a bookmark page similar to speeddail, so searching through your favorites is very convenient.\n\nCons: Others have stated how the apps are limited in number available to the public. That's a huge understatement. There isn't a real Twitter, Reddit, or even TMZ app. I know you may now all be thinking that's a weird combination of apps that I've brought up and my reply to that is \"Well I like to be in the LOOP.\" Now to bringing me back to a pro, the Bookmark page holds enough dials that it is easy to sort through all your favorite websites. Also browsing those websites that don't have an app for the Playbook are not an inconvenience on most sites..\n\nConclusion: If you are wanting to play with apps or use popular apps or wanna do anything at all other than play the Free Need for Speed game that is a really fun game, you had better not get this tablet.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I will present this review in 2 parts; hardware and software. I think RIM did a very good job on the design and build of the Playbook but they clearly rushed the product because the software is nowhere near done.\n\nHARDWARE\nThe Playbook is a 7 inch tablet that is very well built. It is powered by a dual core 1ghz processor that does an exceptional job of keeping up with everything I threw at it. The display is very bright and vivid with great viewing angles. I can't say for sure what kind of glass they used to cover the LCD but I can tell you that its pretty durable, after 4 months of ownership I have yet to notice any scratches on the screen. The Playbook's body is made of mostly plastic but they coated it with a soft touch rubber (matted) that does a good job of giving the Playbook a premium feel while holding in the hand. At the bottom you will find a micro HDMI port, a micro USB port for charging/syncing, and a magnetic charging port for the optional dock. On the top you will find the power button (that is a pain to press), a volume down button, a play button, a volume up button (in that order, also tough to press but not as bad as the power button), and a 3.5mm headphone jack. There is also a 3mp front facing camera for self pics and video chat (which only works with other Playbooks, at the moment) and a rear 5mp camera that is capable of recording HD video. The Playbook's speakers are actually on the front located to the right and left of the display (a very nice touch in my opinion). Because of its smaller size, I found the Playbook a joy to use with one and two hands. Although it is a little on the heavy side for 7in tablet I never really found that to be an issue. One of my biggest gripes with the Playbook is battery life, RIM claims that the battery life on the Playbook is just as good as the iPad but I will have to call BS on that claim. After charging the Playbook to 100% and letting it sit in standby over night the Playbook will have lost 10% of the battery life by morning time (my iPad stayed at 100%). I find myself having to charge my Playbook much more than any of my other tablets (iPad, iPad 2 and Flyer). I enjoy taking the Playbook on vacation with me for videos and net surfing because it is so portable. Videos look great on the 7in screen but I found it annoying that the video player does not allow me to scale the video to full screen (UPDATE: to scale video to full screen, use pinch zoom technique). The speakers are fairly loud with little distortion and because they are front facing the sound comes right at you. The camera takes pretty good photos when there is good lighting, I must say that this is the best camera on any RIM device but I must also say most Blackberry cameras suck. As long as you don't plan on replacing any traditional camera with the Playbook then you will be fine.\n\nSOFTWARE\nThe Playbook runs RIM's next generation OS called QNX and I am totally impressed. If I had to pick my favorite mobile OS this very instance, I would pick QNX. It is very obvious that RIM blatantly ripped off WebOS when they designed QNX, however, I feel that they did it better. The one feature that QNX has over every other mobile OS out there is true multitasking. With the Playbook you can play a video, jump into the browser to surf, reply to an email, and download an app all while the video is still playing in the background. And best of all...there is very little to no lag. During my video play back test, the playbook was able to play both mp4 and avi HD (1080) videos with no problem. Navigating through the OS took a little getting use to but once you overcome the learning curve it becomes second nature (I find myself asking why iOS or Android don't do this). To launch an app, you tap the icon like any other OS but when you want to switch to another open app, all you have to do is swipe left or right with your finger starting from the screen side bezel. Same thing with going to the home screen, you swipe from the bottom up from the bottom bezel or from the top bezel down to access the settings. Once you try it out you will see how easy it is to navigate.\n\nSo why am I not giving the Playbook a 5 star rating when I love the hardware and software? Thats simple; RIM screwed up by launching QNX when it wasn't ready. There is currently no native support for email, calendar, and contacts (these features are coming with QNX v2.0). These are must have features for any tablet to function properly because without them the tablet is nothing more than a media player that surfs the net. RIM tried to make up for not having these features with the bridge program that allows your Playbook to access email, calendar, and contacts via your Blackberry handset. However there is one problem with that approach...not that many people have Blackberries anymore. RIM successfully limited the Playbook's market with that move. The browser on the Playbook is good but it is not the best mobile browser out there (Mobile Safari is still my favorite). There were many instances in which I was fighting with the browser to get it to do what I want (I usually lost and went to my iPad), for example the keyboard will come up and go away, come up and go away when I need to input text or clicking on links that does nothing. The one thing that the browser does best is displaying flash content. Even though other browsers claim that it can display flash content (i.e. Android), non of them does it was well as the Playbook. I can't recall any instances where I was met with the \"no flash plug in\" error like I get on occasion with my Android devices.\n\nDespite what RIM claims, please do not buy a Playbook if you want apps. The Blackberry app store is extremely lacking in app support and whatever apps they do have in there usually suck. This may change with the new update because with the new update the Playbook will be able to run Android apps. But that will only work if the developer decide to port the app over to the Playbook.\n\nI will update the review once QNX 2.0 is released.\n\nFinal verdict: (hopefully RIM gets it right with v2.0 because there is potential here) 3.5/5 stars"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I have been impressed with the Playbook since day 1. Many people (including myself) never expected RIM to deliver such an excellent tablet with QNX under the hood. Specs, OS, GUI and functionality are molded into the device like none other. This is a device built of quality you can see and feel. The multitasking capability is with no exaggeration; incredible! The bridge feature is a huge plus for Blackberry users as it syncs seamlessly and allows for anywhere browsing. Drag and drop makes transferring files to and from a pc easy and natural. Adobe PDF & Docs2Go are included and work very well with your Word, Excel & PowerPoint documents. It's been unfortunate that because of market pitfalls and lack of commercialism this tablet has hovered under the radar. Sure there's not a 1/2 million apps, but that's an evolving fix as developers continue to push them. Everyday more apps are being added. The native email & contacts hick up are fixed an on their way, as RIM mistakenly forgot about consumers & non Blackberry users. OS 2 will soon be delivered with much more than that. This may not be the best tablet for >you< but it's definitely worth researching. I recommend going to Staples which usually has a nice/clean display and spending a little time testing features, interface, AppWorld etc. Also do not be underwhelmed by the 7 inch size, which is perfect for portability, but any one that I know who spends a few hours with it easily overcome the small form factor. As I love the iPad for what it is and tested many Android tablets, this device is a whole different beast."}

Good job RIM keep it up"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "This is the first time I have ever reviewed anything but feel like I should because the Playbook 32Gb is the best!  I have used a Blackberry smartphone for a few years and I love how the Playbook interfaces with it with the Bridge.  My husband has an iPad and after I have shown him everything it can do, he is now questioning why he has an iPad.  Great size!  Someone else commented on the on/off button and I would agree that should be changed, but other than that it is well worth the money (costs a lot less than an iPad).  Less apps?  Yeah, there was a shortage of Apple apps to when they started, but my complaint with Apple apps is that there are way too many, most are useless and there is it difficult to find the apps you want on iTunes.  Blackberry Appworld is way more organized and the apps for the most part are useful!!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "This device is absolutely incredible. I bought mine while it was still on sale (64 GB at more than half off the price). The update does come out in February, which is something that everyone should be looking forward for. I bought this as an alternative to the Ipad because I needed something a little smaller that was still reliable and worked beautifully. It does not have 3G capabilities, which I have to be honest I could care less about because I am always in an area with a hotspot/you can turn your phone into a hotspot if you have a smartphone.\n\nI DO NOT HAVE A BLACKBERRY and you do NOT need one to have the playbook. Yes you can get a bridge between your phone and the playbook but all you need is a Blackberry ID, which is mainly necessary for the App world. (And until the update comes it's not much to brag about.)\n\nThe reason I am giving this a 4 instead of a five, is because the playbook has an extremely fast processor. Like WICKED FAST. Open an internet page next to an ipad and you'll see the difference. The problem with this, is I get really caught up in the loading features that I open like a million tabs at once and then expect it to load the same, which I feel is not too much to ask for. Overall great product. Sleek, professional look, with beautiful cases to match."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Wow.\n\nThis thing rocks! I am just happy as can be with the Playbook. Granted, it's not perfect and the apps are few right now. Quite baren almost...but it's got some help on the way as RIM is giving these out to Android developers willing to port their apps over to the Playbook.\n\nThe Playbook has fast hardware, ample storage, and a great UI. The apps available on the Playbook are basic but elegant. I almost felt like I was using something with an Apple logo on it, everything is sharp and fast. The mutlitasking nature of the tabbed UI is just so inuitive it's literally a fine example of the work these guys do.\n\nI researched tablets for quite a while, thinking over such options as the Kindle Fire, Nook Color, Galaxy Tab, and Toshiba Thrive. After hashing over what was more preferable - screen size, hardware, and build quality - I narrowed it down to just the smaller units. Personally, anything over 7 inches doesn't feel like a real tablet.  I liked the Nook and Kindle for that reason. Ultimately, I chose this because of the price. It's an incredible deal for what you're getting. No GPS though, which kinda foiled my plan of using it as a big GPS nav. But I do just about love it for everything else it offers.\n\nThis is only the 2nd day owning this tablet but I'm very happy with the device and the experience is awesome. I'm coming from 2+ years of Android experience, 2 years Windows Mobile before that, and frankly speaking it's all more or less moving in the same direction. I have NO experience with BB but I do know about the company behind it (Research In Motion) and how they've lost headway to the other phone makers in the last few years. It would be sad to see them go given how they used to lead the pack before.\n\nJust waiting on Blackberry OS 2, even though I'm already hooked on what I've seen."}

After going through the initial setup screens without any issues, creating a blackberry ID etc when I gets to the software update screen, I keep getting a message that it could not connect to the update server and I have NO WAY to proceed?!?!???\n\nI REALLY hope someone at blackberry reads this review because this is completely unacceptable.\n\nNow, first about me, I am a techie and have many many devices, the latest price-drop on the blackberry was just too tempting to pass up, and I will see this problem through and get this device working, but what in the world was Blackberry thinking in locking this device from being used unless you updated???  I realize they want to ensure everyone is running the most recent version, but this is NOT the way to do it.  I would imagine your average less-technical person would simply give up in frustration and return the item to the store and buy another device.  RIM CANNOT afford to take this hardnose aproach like this given their market share and current standing in the industry.  I did manage to find after googling that I can do a forced update via the desktop software, but seriously folks that is not how you want to start a relationship with a new customer, make them spend hours (I am already past hour one as I now wait for the desktop software to download from RIM at a pathetic 20Kbps, reminds me of the old modem days).\n\nAs I said, I'm sure I'll enjoy this device once I get it up and running, but come on, this is totally insane, simply preventing people from using their new device because for wahtever reason it cannot connect to an update server?"}

I agree with all of the favorable reviews from owners & have no idea why so many have panned it. I love the 7 inch size-it will fit better in a purse that is already crowded with baby & toddler gear! I will admit that the BB app world does leave a lot to be desired but I didn't buy the tablet for gaming/entertainment. My selling point was the micro usb slot that can be hooked up to a projector. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the power button does take a little getting used to (in no way is it a deal breaker, though) & the currently available apps. Hopefully the addition of the Android marketplace won't be much longer....regardless I'm hooked.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "First, let's clear the air.  No tablet is a computer although some, like the Acer Iconia W500, do come close; however, the Playbook falls into the leisure category and is no a computer by any stretch of the definition.\n\nAs such, I'm not going to compare it to computers as that's unfair.  Like the vast majority of tablets the Playbook uses apps, not programs, and there is a world of difference.\n\nNow for the nitty-gritty:\n\nWhat You Get:\n\nThe box comes with the unit, a suede like pouch (which, truthfully, provides zero protection), a wall charger, a mini USB to USB connector for file transfers and trickle charging, instructions and a cleaning cloth.\n\nThat's all folks.\n\nLooks:\n\nYou've undoubtedly already read the measurement and weight specs so we'll dispense with that.  From an aesthetic standpoint it's a much better design than most with a glass front bordered by a rather thick black bezel and a rubberized back (which makes it easy to hold).  Due to light weight and small frame it's no problem to hold or carry and much easier than the iPad (which is twice as big and heavy as the Playbook).\n\nNow for the Pros:\n\nEasy to handle and hold\n\nEven the base 16GB unit has enough space left over for tons of apps and files (I figured that nearly 14GB was left over after the OS was installed)\n\nOnce you learn the drill, the screen gestures become second nature and I found it easier to use than the iPad method\n\nPinch to zoom works flawlessly without Apple's problem of \"checkerboarding\" where the screen develops a checkerboard pattern while it attempts to render the area you just zoomed\nVolume buttons are up top which keeps them out of harm's way and also keeps users from pushing them during normal use\n\nFront camera has decent quality images, sufficient for chatting but the rear camera has much higher resolution and takes surprisingly crisp pictures and video\nThe browser is quick, very quick.  Much faster than even the iPod or Kindle Fire.\n\nFlash laden sites are no problem\n\nVideos play without stuttering or skipping\n\nConsistent wireless connectivity\n\nOnce you set it up you can transfer files from your computer to the Playbook and vice versa wirelessly\n\nNice, colorful and legible screen.  May even be better than the iPad's even though it's not as large\n\nSurprisingly trouble free keyboard.  May be difficult to type with but it never once mistyped or failed to register a key I pushed.\n\nThe app store isn't that bad although prices were a little steep in my estimation.  This will change once Android apps are ported in mid-February.\n\nStellar battery life.  Never less than 9 hours.\n\nIt can be tethered to your Blackberry Smartphone for connectivity should wireless not be available but check compatibility with your phone before jumping - some won't work\n\nComplaints about the recessed power button are unfounded.  It's recessed and small so you don't power of the unit while holding it.  Guess others just haven't figured that out.\n\nNow for the Cons:\n\nInexcusable boot times of a minute or more.  Kind of hard to justify given the flash drive and limited depth of the OS\n\nTake my word and kill Bluetooth unless you're using it.  That function is a horrible power sucker\n\nLooking for Kindle Reader or MSN chat?  Sorry, isn't happening right now although Android's app porting may change that.  Does come with Facebook chat, though.  Oh, and there's no email or calendar functions built in, either.\n\nBy the time you read this Android apps should be available but they were not for quite a while and this irked quite a few users\n\nToss the included cover and get one with padding.  I can smell an accident waiting to happen\n\nNo NetFlix although that may change.  Hulu videos in basic mode play just fine but those desiring Hulu Plus will find out it's not geared to Playbook.\n\nNo serviceable parts is this puppy.  No way of upgrading drive space or RAM (which is about par for tablets)\n\nMini USB is for charging and transferring files and that's about it but the charging is a 1:1 proposition from what I've seen (meaning nearly 9 hours of charging to get 9 hours of use).  The wall charger cuts this back substantially; however, if you use the unit while charging it almost uses the same amount of power thtn you're providing (meaning you're going forward very little).\n\nOccasionally would flip the screen upside down for no good reason and I couldn't get it back without powering off.  After a couple times I merely flipped it over and worked upside down.\n\nKeyboard is largely for hunt and peck typists only and those used to texting will find it easier to just put the unit in portrait mode and use their thumbs to type\n\nDropbox, where art thou?  You'll have to install Bluebox, a Dropbox simulator if you won't to park files and retrieve them from the Cloud.\n\nNot Linux friendly.  Works well with Windows or OS X but Linux required I shut the unit down, plug in the USB port, and then boot Playbook while Linux was running.  Even then it was treated as an external drive and you'd better know where to put your files as not to ruin the OS\n\nRear camera is great but auto-focus is largely a matter of luck and there is a delay when taking pictures.  This means you can't move the unit after pressing the onscreen shutter button or you'll risk a blurred picture\n\nIt's not iOS nor is it Android so what happens if RIMM tanks?\n\nI could go on but you've probably got the picture by now.\n\nSo is the Playbook worth the price?  Depends upon your needs.  Forget typing documents of any length and while video playback is above average it soon became apparent that the Playbook is just like any other tablet - good in a pinch but of limited usefulness otherwise.\n\nFor $200 it's not a bad deal and cheaper than even the bargain basement netbooks, but it's still a play toy and not a serious instrument except for those that use or require Internet connectivity on a constant basis; however, at the original cost of $500 for a base unit it's just not worth the expenditure (you can get a halfway decent notebook for that much)."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I ordered two 64gb Playbooks through RIM's site (free shipping, no tax, figured the mfg stands behind its products if any issues arise).  My mistake.  Should have ordered via Amazon.com since they set the standard on customer care.  It would have cost a bit more, but I wouldn't have to waste my time writing this review.\n\nAgain, I bought two Playbook's, both 64gb. One for me, the other for my wife since we're both BB 9900 and 9810 users and loyalists.  One Playbook was defective right out of the box.  It had a dead pixel, which by the way they said they couldn't do anything about because \"it's within our acceptable range\" for dead pixels.  I couldn't believe my ears.  It's like buying a new car with a crack on the windshield, and the dealership says \"that's ok, because we set our standards so low, that this is actually a good thing\".\n\nIt didn't end there.  The device would also freeze up and not allow me to turn it off.  Then they refused to allow me to return both devices, even though the second device was still in the box, unopened.  They said they need to attempt to repair it, and they couldn't repair the dead pixel.  I have to live with that problem they said.  That process would have taken at least 3 weeks.  They also had the nerve to tell me to keep the unopened box device and use that one, and then they would take back the device with the problem.  I was thinking, \"seriously?\", do they think I'm that desperate or stupid?\n\nI guarantee you, Apple or any Android device maker wouldn't conduct their QC or customer service that way.\n\nFinally, I pretty much had to keep calling until they sent me a new device.  That device didn't come in the same packaging.  So now, I have a supposed \"new\" 64gb Playbook, with the box of the old one, which obviously doesn't have the same SN.  They called that the \"advanced exchange\".  To their defense, they did overnight that with a prepaid FedEx label for the device I returned.  But that's after putting a $699 retail price hold on my credit card.  I paid $299 for my device, but they put a hold of $699 on my credit card.  Figure that one out.  Nice, right?\n\nI've been a BB user for almost 10 years now.  I can't believe how quickly this company has gone from being the innovator in the space to the catastrophe of the space.\n\nIf you're having trouble getting to customer support, try this number (877) 255.2377.  You'll need a case number and from that point, they're pretty good about denying responsibility for their subpar products.  It's a customer support nightmare.\n\nI'm now stuck with the two devices which I'm debating keeping.  I really did like the bridge feature and being able to access the internet while mobile, without having to pay for a 3G or 4G service.  But the lack of apps and so many other missing features, which the press has written about extensively makes it an unattractive device compared to what's available out there.  Not to mention all the technical issues the device has.\n\nRIM's third party fulfillment company GlobalWare Solutions said they've escalated my request to return the devices to their committee and they will decide if they'll send me an RMA with a prepaid shipping label.  Nice, huh?  No one has called me yet.  I'm in a big \"BLACK\"-BERRY hole.  Their number is (866) 957-0761, and they referred me to their BB technical support at (877) 644-8410, which then referred me to the BB website.  It's one clown short of a three-ring circus.\n\nNow you know why their stock price is where it is, and why customers are taking losses and getting rid of their devices, and to leave the mess this company has created for itself, and it's loyalists.\n\nRidiculous if you ask me.  Not to mention, very embarrassing.\n\nYou're bound to see more and more negative comments about customer experiences with the Playbook that will crush any attempts RIM will make to keep itself above water.  This thing is starting to unravel faster than they can do damage control.\n\nThis product was not ready for launch, and they clearly rushed it due to pressure.  Now, instead of standing behind its products and reputation, and making things right for unhappy customers, it's deflecting accountability and responsibility and leaving the customer high and dry.\n\nNice going RIM."}

On the metro, stuck in traffic....sitting in a store with the wife and kids.....Unless I'm at home or work and then I have a computer!\n\nThe ability to hook up to your phone is the seller for me.

IMO it is not worth the price if one cannot do what you need ....\n\nemail= no problem using yahoo & gmail.\n\nboarding passes = sometimes it works sometimes not. many times i cannot get the curser into box or the small windows to choose dates that pop up freeze or i can't make a choice = i end up using 3g on cell.\n\nhotel/plane reservation= same problem as boarding pass = end up using 3g on cell.\n\nmaps = fair to so-so  .. if you are looking at a resturant and they provide a map ( google or bing) and i click on map it pops up a new browser page and it freezes and i have to cloes it. = end up using google maps on cell ... anyway i get to google maps it doesn't work = freezes ... going to BING and clicking on maps = freezes.\nthe playbook does have a bing map app. that works so-so to ok . problem there is say i'm looking at santa monica and i click on resturants. it shows 7 ( 1-7) resturants on map. i can click next page and now it shows 8-14 on map ..finally by page 6 i see my resturant say #44 .. i then zoom into map and by the time i can see the street name the resturants have reset to 1-7 .. i then jump to page 6 and now the map is zoomed out and my resturant isn't there because now it might be #30 or #40 or #9 .. seems to change every time and again once i zoom into map it always goes back to page 1 on listings ..\n\nsurfing the net = so-so ..many times the pop ups do not work, hard to get curser into boxes, pages do not load or do not work ( freezes )\n\nthe playbook is set up to work with a blackberry phone. i do have a wifi hotspot on my cell. no problem with playbook connecting to it but in the end it's not good enough here ... i've been on 3 trips since i've had the playbook and every trip i've ended up using my cell to finish up what the playbook couldn't.\n\ni've been told that OS V2 mid feb 2012 will fix it.\n\noh lets not forget about the on/off button. it's a pain .. i can press on it for 5, 10 , 20 seconds and nothing. not sure what pressure turns it on?  you can turn it off without using the button BUT the only way to turn it on is using it. right after i bought it i went to 2 stores that carried playbook to see if mine had a problem. both stores had playbooks on display and none worked. last week i went by 3 stores and again NONE worked. these are not display models they are suppose to be working playbooks. i did find one at a best buy begin of Jan and the ON button was worse then mine. so i just don't turn it off. i find that after approx 3 days of not using it - it is very difficult to wake up.\nother then the ON button the hardware seems to be very good to excellent. HDMI easily connects to TV, projector.\nIMO it's the software that needs work. hoping V2 makes it usable ..\nnot a happy playbook owner ( yet)\n\nupdate 4/9/2012\n\nupgraded to 2.0 ..\nno problem making plane/hotel /boarding pass, reservations ..\nbing maps works much better ... google maps still does not work ...\ntakes over 3min to boot up ... seems to me, clicking on links is worse ( nothing happens)in OS 2 ..\nalso i use to leave it in standby ( because it is difficult to turn ON) but since OS 2\ni find that after 24hrs in stand-by it is very difficult to get it out of stand-by and when i do, about 40% of the time it is frozen = have to restart ...\nstill think the ON=OFF button is the WORST ..\ni'm not finding the \" it works with android apps\" working that well ...\ni do like the 7\" size ..\nIMO OS 2 is a slight improvement  ..\ntoday i take a 4.3\" android phone on trips (no cell service on it, only use WiFi ) instead of the playbook because it works much better ... take a 3.2\" android for cell phone use ...\nnot a happy playbook owner ... use it less and less ...\nit's OK but OK is not good enough\n\nupdated 9/23/12\nthere was a small update in software since last april ..\nno longer have any problems getting it out of stand-by after 24hrs or even 4-5 days of stand-by... but now making reservations is difficult because 75% of the time i can't click on the icons to finish teh reservation or should i say i don't know if i clicked on the icon ? they don't highlight, i click on em and nothing happens but then i'll check my email 5 min later and see that i just made 3 reservations at the hotel or i bought 2 train tickets ? it never went to a confirm page when i was trying to make reservation ...BING maps is difficult to use with the new software update ( again can't click on the icons ) ... i now consider this thing USELESS ... if one can't click on icons then it sits there ...60% i can't go BACK to previous web page ... i pretty much stopped using it last april (2012) .. was thinking of taking it to europe next week but after trying it out last week it just can't complete reservations and it's a pain to surf the web  , will replace this with a android tablet when i return ... changed rating to 1 star ( from 2)  ..will never again buy a RIM product/service .."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "First of all, I bought this device about three weeks ago through Blackberry, not from Amazon, but I wanted to share my experience.  I was able to get this for $249.00.\n\nFirst the pro-Playbook stuff:\n\nI was looking for something portable to replace or augment my laptop in a way that would allow me to be more productive, and I liked the idea that the Blackberry Playbook could bridge to my Blackberry smartphone.  This is HUGE.  When I am riding the subway, this allows me to update my calendar, task list and other stuff on the Playbook and automatically have it show up on my smartphone.  At 32 GB, I haven't even begun to hit the limit, and I have several movies, a ton of books, and lots of pictures, plus a moderate amount of music on it (I set my Playbook to sync with my Top 25 most Played list of my IPod, and then added a few other specific artists).  The size is great.  It is a little big to fit in the pocket of a suit coat, but the size is perfect for the inside pocket of an overcoat, or a large external pocket of a coat.  This puts it at about the right size for a small to medium woman's purse, I think.  Basically it is the same size as the Kindle Fire.  The screen is very responsive, the high def video is AMAZING, and the learning curve for tactile navigation is very short.  It picks up Wi-Fi very quickly and easily, and it does the same with bluetooth, plus it remembers the key passes for bluetooth or network devices once you enter them, so there is not a lot to remember when you want to sign onto a familiar protected network.\n\nCons:  It is a little heavier than I anticipated.  It is LIGHTER than an I-Pad for sure, but you should expect this item to weigh about as much as a small jar of pickles.  This might be an issue for some people, but hasn't been for me.  Occasionally the icons you tap, or buttons you tap take a moment or so to respond.  Sometimes the interface with AppWorld is touch-and-go on downloads.  They HAVE NOT YET RELEASED the Kindle Reader for the Playbook (this is as much RIM as it is Amazon), so I am still waiting for the release of the new Pro-Android App OS under OS2, which is supposed to roll out on February 17th, according to RIM's website and latest industry news.  I will believe it when I see it.\n\nAPPS:  For now, here is a brief list of APPS I have added and recommend:\n\nAIR Browser is a Free App that allows you to explore the file structure on the device like Windows Explorer or the Apple equivalent.  I find this useful to find media that I cannot find, or that the program does not detect (like some AZW files I transferred).\n\nEPub Book Reader is another Free App that allows you to do your e-reading, including AZW files.  A NOTE OF CAUTION:  DRM-Protected AZW files will be unreadable as of today's date.  Thus you cannot use this to read Kindle purchased books for the time being.\n\nFourPlay - Recommended to me as a FourSquare user, this was described on CIO.com as a useful Free App.\n\nLaterDude - just allows you to put a sticky note on your screen and fill it with whatever Post-it type notes you might have for yourself.  Free App\n\nGuitar Playbook - holds various guitar tunings and chords for the whole scale - a neat little app for the guitar players  (you can also use this to tune).\n\nInvestment Week - Free app - pretty self explanatory, and highly rated.\n\nPoynt  - Free app to find stuff nearby like movies, people, businesses, restaurants, gas, events and offers\n\nScratch Pad - a Free app that lets you write in free-hand.\n\nDoodle Blast - a free intro version of a paid game - fun for a day.\n\nScoreMobile - Free Sports scores app\n\nQFolio - a Free Nasdaq stock app\n\nThe Big Package - a central app for free that allows you to track packages from different delivery companies in one site.\n\nNavita Translator and Fancy Tran - two free translation apps that are actually pretty good\n\nGames:  Hangman, Free  solitaire, Playbook Chess, Gravity Burst Lite, Fruits and Ninjas, NYT Crosswords (all free apps)\n\nCurrency - free currency converter.\n\nNetflix Queue Manager - meant to handle Netflix download queue.\n\nSo far I am pretty happy.\n\nJust hoping the Android app interface rolls soon."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "So about a year ago, I bought myself a netbook. I already own a desktop PC, and Android phone, but I wanted the netbook so I could browse the web on the go and didn't like doing it on my phone because the screen was too small. I've been eyeing the iPads for a while as well, but the price point was just a bit too high for me, seeing as you can buy a decent netbook for cheaper. I was attracted to the touch screen and all the cool little apps you can download, but when it really comes down to it, I just wanted a good portable browser that I could use comfortably for an extended period of time, which I could not do on my phone.\n\nWell, after a while of lugging the netbook around, I decided it wasn't so portable after all and more of a pain than I thought it would be to carry it around. Still, I didn't really 'need' a tablet and still didn't want to spend a lot of money for a new device, so I just stuck with it. Then a few months ago, I found out about the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet, and realized they were both affordable enough to consider buying one. I also realized I didn't like the 10 inch tablets because they seemed too large and don't have that feeling of portability that I wanted, especially since I already have a 12 inch netbook that already feels cumbersome. I was still unsure though... I didn't know anything about the tablet market and wasn't even sure what else I'd use it for other than browsing the web and random stuff I could do on my phone. I still had my desktop PC after all.\n\nI waited a while for the reviews for both the Fire and Nook to come out, read a bunch of them, including comparisons and etc, and decided I would wait a little longer to get one since I wasn't in urgent need of one. A few weeks later, I had some extra cash lying around and decided I was going to bite the bullet and finally order a tablet. I read some more reviews, and based off of those, I realized the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet were just too locked down for me and just seemed like a hub for spending more money on their stores. Some of the negative reviews said the browsers were sluggish or kind of jumpy sometime, and that made me more uncertain. I decided to look into the other 7 inch tablets and see what the difference was between all of them, and see why those tablets cost more. Just for research's sake.\n\nThats when I came across the Blackberry Playbook. I saw that the price had recently been dropped, and even though I missed the fire sale, the $300 price point is still doable (I actually have the 64GB version). Especially for the impressive hardware it comes with. I also considered the Samsung Galaxy 7 tab as well as the Acer Iconia, but both of those are more expensive and doesn't really come with anything that would justify spending that much more on a tablet. And of course, I went into my review reading frenzy, and despite the few negative things that people dislike about the Playbook, it didn't really bother me  much and I decided to give this product a chance and boy am I glad I did!\n\nHere's what made this purchase worth it for me and why I am very satisfied with it.\n\n-Fast full flash browser. A slow, jerky browser would certainly get on my nerves, everytime I use it. This is important. A lot of other tablets have sub-par browsers and the Playbook browser is surprisingly fast.\n-Smooth seamless UI. The QNX OS. Like another review stated, I do not want to feel like I am using a large version of my phone, nor do I need another 'compact netbook' device. I want a product that feels unique and different. This is a versatile and powerful electronic toy in a sense. It does everything that I want, and does it well. I don't really care that it isn't Android, especially since it seems to work just as well, if not better.\n-Beautiful screen. Everyone can agree on that.\n-Very high quality speakers and placed in a practical location on the device (on the front sides). I really dislike when the speakers are on the back or can easily be muffled, or if they sound cheap and crackly. The volume level is impressive too.\n-5MP rear and 3MP front facing camera. Most of the other tablets in this price range do not include a camera. I don't think I'll use it that much, but this was definitely a perk as I still want to have it just in case I do decide to start using it. And who doesn't like taking self photos??\n-You can tether your phone and get GPS as well.\n\nAnd for those who are worried about the lack of apps in the store... I will admit, the store does not have hundred thousands of apps like the other stores, but I do not really feel that limited. There are still plenty of apps, and a lot of free ones as well. And for those who don't know, a new OS release is coming out soon for the Playbook that should fix all those problems that the haters have been complaining about. And honestly anyone who complains about the tiny power button... it's tiny for a reason. It's hard to hit for a reason. Do you want to accidently turn your tablet off in the middle of using it? After you turn it on, you don't even need to turn it off really! You put it in standby mode and all it takes to turn it back on is a simple swipe from top to bottom of the screen. The standby mode does not drain much battery at all. Seriously... sometimes I feel like people just have to find something to complain about because they are fanboys to the other two A words.\n\nTLDR: If you want an impressive piece of hardware at a great price and a fast and unique OS, get the Playbook. And if you're concerned about the apps, wait for the new OS release. And if that's still not good enough for you, go buy yourself a dang Apple or Android tablet and stop hating. Trust me, just because they do a lot more marketing and are more popular, does not make them flawless. If you're a TRUE hipster, you'll get off that bandwagon and give this one a chance."}

First of all, there aren't any good apps for this device. The RIM OS is horrible. And do not turn the device off or let it die. Once you do you will spend 5 hours just getting this thing to turn on. the power button is so tiny. You cant even press it down without hurting your fingers. When you are finally able to press the button you get a whole bunch of lights flashing you don't even know what is going on. After pressing the button 5 times u can get the device to turn on. But again when its on you have nothing to do on it except go on Facebook or browse the web. This tablet sucks. don't waste money on this go buy an ipad or an android tablet."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I've had an iPad for a couple of years so I held off getting Blackberry Playbook as I couldn't see the point in having two tablets. When the price of the Playbook dropped just before Christmas I decided to treat myself and boy, am I glad I did.\n\nI loved it so much I decided the 16GB version just wasn't big enough for me and so I went back out the other weekend and treat myself to the 64gb model, so now I have two Playbooks.\n\nSo, what is so good about the Playbook and why do I prefer it to the iPad.\n\n1. It is just so much nicer to use. By comparison the iPad is clunky and bland. Once you get used to the various screen swipes (there are quite a few) you can just breeze from open application to open application, bring up the keyboard, close an app, open an another app. It is all so amazingly easy and so much more enjoyable than than constantly having to press the button at the bottom of the iPad screen numerous times just to do the most basic thing such as swapping from one app to another. On the Playbook what takes several button presses to do on the iPad takes ONE swipe. Brilliant!\n\n2. I far prefer the size of the Playbook. The iPad was too big and bulky for me to lug around. I can just pop the playbook in my pocket and hit the coffee shop. It is like like reading a paperback rather than a heavy hardback book.\n\n3. he installed apps are pretty much everything I need and more. Unlike the iPad the Playbook comes with a superb word processor, spreadsheet, etc. Yes, there aren't a million apps to download, but do you know what. I've not touched my iPad in weeks and I've not missed one single app on it - not one!\n\n4. It is so much easier to add content onto the Playbook. Just plug it in with a USB cable and copy the files from your computer straight onto the device. No need to mess around with iTunes. Just drag the files over, put them wherever you like and the Playbook will do the rest. I add about one hundred albums and dozens of movies and it took me minutes. The same thing with iTunes would have involved selecting all sorts of things, syncing, resyncing, installing the latest update, and blah blah. None of that with the Playbook, which means I'm free of the nasty iTunes.\n\n5. You can connect the Playbook to your TV with an HDMI cable that costs a few bucks. Unlike the iPad which requires a special $40 lead that works some of the time, but not all of the time (check out the reviews of it on Amazon and you will see what I mean).\n\n6. The screen display is amazing. Just put it next to an iPad 2 and you can see instantly how much better it is. The colors are vibrant, the text is crystal clear, and it is just so darned fast and smooth. Check out the sample HD video that comes with it.\n\nThat is just six reasons. There are many more.\n\nI honestly can't see me ever wanting to go back to the iPad, but I can see me putting the iPad on eBay in the not too distant future."}

The size is just right for portability and furthermore, the ergonomics of the device are agreeable as well. The battery life of the device is sufficient and I have yet to run into any problems with the operating system. The playbook that I own is the 32gb version and the reason for my purchase was to have a device that would not be as cumbersome as a laptop to carry with me as I travel. So far, I've had my playbook for about a month and would say that I am happy with this device. If that should change, I will return and amend this review.\n\nThis review was written on the Blackberry Playbook."}

I won't quite hold my breath, but if those apps come out, I will be more than satisfied with this product. Especially since I got mine, 32GB used, like new, for the same price as a 16GB. Totally worth it. Beautiful screens, a lot of space, a good price, and they do about everything you would need a tablet to do.\nI love that it's small."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "First a disclaimer: I did not buy my 64GB Playbook from Amazon, but rather from RIM directly, so I can't comment on the Amazon experience.\nOverall Assessment: I like my Playbook and all it has to offer. My only major beef with it is the current lack of a sufficiently featured PDF reader.\n\nThe details of my experience:\n\nHardware, Setup, Performance & Quality: Initial setup of the PB was easy with setup wizard. Note that you'll need access to a WIFI network for this setup to be effective. The PB operating system sports a very elegant and easy to use interface; you interact with it via touch screen finger taps, moving gestures, and a pull-up keyboard. The touch screen is pretty responsive, though there are some buttons with a small fingerprint size that can require precision, resulting in the occasional unsuccessful tapping. Video graphic quality is excellent, the UI is beautiful and HD videos play crisp and smooth.\n\nApps: The PB comes standard with about two dozen apps: a web browser, camera, OfficeToGo, facebook, youtube, twitter are just a few of the main ones. The blackberry appworld allows you to download more, many of them free, some of them very cheap (one to two bucks a apiece), and some nicer ones more expensive. For instance, the PB doesn't come with a file browser, but appworld provides the Air browser for free and several other file explorers for pretty cheap. While the PB appworld library is probably nowhere near as extensive as the IPad's, there are nonetheless apps for the vast majority of needs out there, and certainly a lot of great business and investment related apps.\n\nOne fascinating feature for those with a Blackberry phone is Bridge, which allows you to link your phone and the PB via bluetooth. This permits syncing of email, calendar, and other data that is already on your phone. Additionally, there is a limited web browsing capability through Bridge, though it is pretty slow. You can also tether your PB's internet through the higher data stream of your BB phone, though depending on your carrier, there may be a separate data plan and additional cost required for it.\n\nI think PB's greatest chink in its armor is the lack of a good PDF reader. I have a lot of PDF references for my job, and this shortcoming was a real arrow to the knee. It does ship with Adobe Reader, but this version of the reader is virtually featureless, allowing paging and scrolling through a PDF with no option to search for text, create or find bookmarks, or make notes. There are e-readers available in appworld, such as Kobo, but none that can open PDFs. In search of a compromise, I found converting PDFs to EPUBs to be only about 20% successful. The end result is that the PB is a poor solution for interacting with PDFs at an enterprise level, which is really surprising considering the market RIM has been catering to for the past 15 years.\n\nBut... the future is nevertheless promising for the playbook. Despite the reduction in production and pricing, RIM is continuing to develop and upgrade the PB operating system. Next month, the new OS2 is supposed to be officially released, and with it the Android Marketplace, which should open up PB to a wider variety of apps, including a number of superior PDF apps. I'm really looking forward to that day. There is also a lively community of users and app developers at the blackberry and crackberry forums, with tons of great information that can lead you down a rabbit hole of tweaks, jailbreaks and troubleshooting methods for the PB.\n\nA final word: considering the price of a new 64gb IPad 2 as of this writing (about $600 before tax/shipping), I'd say the Playbook is a hell of a deal. I'd also recommend shopping around and looking for the best price on the 64g PB. Best Buy discounted all models to the same price (and I am told is almost out of stock of the 64gb), as did RIM. I ended up ordering from RIM because they didn't charge me shipping or tax, the grand total was 299.99.\n\nEDIT (2/18/2012): I discovered by looking around the crackberry forums that the Repligo PDF reader is available as a sideload app. This requires your PB be updated to OS2 beta, and then you have to sideload the program BAR files using an installer like DDPB, but once that's done, this reader is amazing and provides all the features that I need to utilize my PDFs! Once the full OS2 comes out, hopefully Repligo will be provided in Appworld so you don't have to bother with sideload methods, but in any case, a PDF solution for the PB does exist."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Update #2:  I have FINALLY been able to read a kindle book off line on this tablet although it's far from a great experience. I don't know if what I did made the difference, but .... with wifi on and connected I enabled pop-ups.  Then I used the cloud reader link on the \"app/link\" page I'd created earlier, went to downloaded books (I'd \"downloaded\" four)and opened one and read some.  Pages don't turn well but it's doable if not fun.  Then I turned off the wireless but did NOT close the browser and was able to go back to it and continue reading.  However, I found that if you close the browser app you're done for; poof, it's all gone when you reopen it and you have to enable/connect the wifi and start all over again to get back to your book.  Oh, and Bing maps has finally more or less located me - twice and briefly - a few blocks from my actual location.\n\nUpdate:  Upon further reflection I'm going to upgrade the rating to .... 3 stars, I think.  It does a nice job with photos and videos (and music) and I don't expect something of this size to be much of a \"work machine\", just more of a fun \"take along\" as RugRat says, something in size between my iPhone (too small for much photo/video stuff) and my iPad (too big for a purse)and with somehow a sleeker feel and a little more easy versatility than my Kindle Fire.  Yahoo (sbcglobal) and gmail access work, web browsing is fine.  BUT - the location service still doesn't work, Blackberry tech support gets NEGATIVE stars, and the biggest problem - a deal-breaker really - is that I can't read my Kindle books without internet access.  I'm not going to carry around TWO 7\" tablets, and in the war of Books vs Videos Books win hands down.\n\nOriginal Review:  I've had this for two days and so far I like the look and feel but not much else.  I've done two hard resets and made three calls to tech support who were if possible worse than useless.  On the first call I got a live person, I asked a question, was put on hold and disconnected after 6 minutes.  The second call disconnected AT the transfer, and on the third call I got a human again who mostly said things like \"yeah, maybe\" and \"I don't know\" and couldn't even explain or walk me through some of the basic steps I'd already done.  So far Bing Maps cannot \"locate\" me - at all - even though the other GPS-less but wifi devices next to it can.  Granted they are sometimes a few blocks off, but the Playbook just says \"unable to locate - please try later\" (I think trying repeatedly over two days is enough). And, try as I might, I've been unable to read - or even find - my supposedly \"downloaded to the device\" Kindle books while offline despite hours of searching and trying possible online \"solutions \" or work-arounds. They may have worked for some, but not on the unit I have.  When I asked the Blackberry rep for help with this issue he clearly didn't have any idea and first had me go through a bunch of things I'd already done that didn't work.  When I really pressed him on the subject - because if I can't figure out a way to do this I'm most likely returning it - he put me on hold for a few minutes and came back to say there was \"no way I could read the Kindle books on the playbook.\""}

I researched all the tablets in this price range and the playbook seemed to be the superior.  Reviews were praising it's dual core processor, its speed, its task management, saying its professional grade, etc.  Well, the Playbook falls short in most of these areas.\n\nThe browswer is fast, but extrememly glitchy.  You have to keep reloading websites becausse it freezes before it finishes rendering the page.  The picture section is just plain aweful.  Theres no way to create a new folder or gallery for pics.  Therez no way to move pics around or in to a new order.  Theres no way to hide pics or folders.  I knew the app store for blackberry wasn't as big as the others but thats the understatment of the decade.  The have NOTHING intreseting or useful enough for me to consider downloading.  The keyboard sucks.  No auto correct.  No auto puncuation.\n\nThe screen is really nice though. And it has HDMI out to my tv. Thats the best thing I have to say about it.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I really, really wanted to like this tablet- as everyone knows, it has great hardware and to be able to get a 64 gb unit for $300 is a good deal in any book. But at the end of the day, I found myself saying \"wow, I wish I could ____ this on this tablet like I could on any other, but I can't.\" Here's a pros and cons list:\n\nPROS:\n-Great OS: I really like the interface, the multitasking is phenomenal (you can watch other applications in the background), it was fast.\n-Browser is great, all web sites rendered normally.\n-HD display is phenomenal. Really, really good.\n-Sound quality: My friend has an iPad2 and this blew the speakers on that unit away. True stereo.\n-HDMI out- plugs right into TVs, no problem. Nice.\n-Blackberry bridge: I used this with a blackberry phone on a trip (my friend's phone) and it worked perfectly out of the box. No tethering fee and didn't need to pay for wireless.\n-Fully accessible file system, unlike iPad.\n-Loved the size and the way it fits in your hand.\n-Good value for the hardware.\n-Has word, excel, etc. on it in mobile form.\n\nnow, the OTHER list:\n\nCONS\n-NO APPS!!!!! The Blackberry app store is a JOKE. Half of them (literally) don't even work- the developers only made it to get a free playbook as per a deal Blackberry offered. Netflix, etc- nope. Yes, there's an update coming, but not all andriod apps will be available, and there's no indication Netflix/Hulu will be there. Not that this is a dealbreaker on its own, but the selection will be extremely limited, unless you want to sideload. But you shouldn't have to! (Note: the browser will NOT run netflix, don't even try). There's not even a dictionary app that works. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE HOW MUCH THIS SUCKS. I initially said, \"I'll just use it to browse the web, no big deal,\" but other tablets can now browse the web just as well.\n-No e-mail client. Will also be fixed with next OS. This was never a big deal to me as GMail worked fine on the browser\n-No text autocorrect, and it was difficult to place the cursor in an active text field.\n-Some features just didn't work. For example, I should have been able to access my Playbook as a Samba server wirelessly. I couldn't.\n-Bluetooth audio doesn't work. Not available with the software. Why they didn't include this is beyond me.\n\n-Last but not least: RIM is a company with a questionable future that is completely tone deaf to the needs and wants of their customers. Their software is consistently delivered late and underwhelming. Contrast this to Google or Apple, two major innovators who are constantly pumping out new products that make life easier. There is just no comparison. Why jump on the sinking ship?\n\nBottom line: I ended up returning it. If you want a tablet, get one that runs Android. You can just do so much more with it at the end of the day. The only thing that makes this truly unique is the multitasking, but I think Android's multitasking gets you 90% of the way there. Background tasks can run, but you can't actively monitor them all at once. No big deal.\n\nSorry, RIM- maybe I'll buy another one for $99 WHEN (not if) they have a fire sale, but not for more than that."}

There are very few good apps that work on the Playbook right now. It is clear Blackberry is doing whatever they can to make a buck on apps and keeping the android market away from us.\n-There is hype about movie apps, but right now there is nothing....No Netflix, no Amazon, no Hulu no nothing!\n-GPS does not work enough or have apps that work to be usable.\n-HDMI means nothing without movie apps.\n-The video conferencing is a joke at this point unless you know someone else who has a playbook that you can use it with.  There are no decent apps that work with a PC.\n-The video camera (3mp) shoots extremely grainy indoors.\n-It has no memory card expansion slots.

The devices I would buy would be the HTC EVO Tablet that is just out for only three hundred, or the Le Pan II for less than three hundred.\n\nI found out too late why the Playbook never took off.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I'm no techie.  I don't root or jailbreak but I do love my gadgets and tech.  I am an Apple aficionado and have been using apple products since I wrote my thesis on my tiny 12\" iBook way back in the G4 days.  I use Mac Pro at work and at home, own MacBooks as well.  (Shh, I also have a PC at home.)\n\nWhen the iPad was introduced I jumped on it and purchased one for myself.  When the iPad2 came out I opened up my wallet and purchased the top of the line 64 Gig 3G.  Beautiful products.  (I personally like how the first iPad looked and felt...the second felt more breakable.)  The screen was amazing and the apps were just as brilliant.  I wanted to love it.  There was so much potential.\n\niPad2 was not exactly a quantum leap over the first.  It was actually quite a disappointing purchase.  The camera sucked the screen was just as good as the first the processor was marginally better on a day-to-day experience, graphics were great but if I wanted serious gaming I'd play on a platform designed for gameplay.  Where did it excel?  The \"cool\" apps you'd purchase for $5.99 and get tired of in a month?  It was shiny and pretty but far too big to be truly a portable pad.  I love it for quick presentation and 2-3 people meetings.  I tried taking it with me on vacation a couple of times but it was just too big and heavy.  So as good as it was it stayed home.\n\nEnter the Playbook.  I didn't like Blackberry nor most of its products.  For the longest time they either looked too business suit with business emails or youth oriented for hammering text messages or \"facebooking/tweeting\".  The Playbook came in at such a great price point that I needed to try it out.  I've must have read every review before I finally purchased it.  Hardware wise I give the edge to Playbook...cameras are even much better.  Its an elegant machine with great lines.  I really never really liked that \"home\" button on the iPhone and iPad.  It always stood out for me and was usually the first thing to look worn out.\n\nThe operation on the PB is seamless and intuitive. Multitasking is well executed...but things like cutting and pasting lines and photos need work (perhaps with the new OS?).  Alot of USEFUL apps were already INCLUDED.  (Albeit buggy or missing a little bit of finesse/user friendliness.)\n\nI find myself using my Playbook everyday: at home, on the commute to work and even at work!  I haven't touched my iPads in months now. The playbook even has gone on vacation with me!  Recently I even purchased a Blackberry Bold to pair with it.  Brilliant!  The iPad doesn't have this level of secure interconnectivity with the iPhone.  As a result my iPhone4 and both my iPads are stuck in a drawer gathering dust.  I'm thinking of just giving these to my parents because they really just seem like expensive toys.\n\nWhat I wish the Playbook can do:\n- Access BlackBerry phone microSD card.  File types are restricted.  I can use it as an external drive.  I this would have been an amazing feature that would have just solidified Blackberry's phone and tablet sales.\n- Have more apps - but I guess this is in the works.  Access to the Android market is something I'm looking forward to with the next OS update (??WHEN??)  Really need my Netflix and Skype!  Some magazines?\n- Access to phone - to make phone calls via the tablet through head phones. That way the Torch can stay in my bag when I have the tablet in hand.\n- Ability to upload photos from my eye-fi or an SD card reader adapter.  Even access to a portable external hard drive would be great.\n\nI think its a better tablet than the iPad and iPad2 for my everyday use.\n\nHope that was someone helpful for those on the fence.  Also you can't beat that price!"}

It's compact, lightweight, and the screen is the perfect size. Also the cameras both take and record brilliant pictures.  If this smart little device had android features and/or were capable of downloading android apps, play all flash content and had accessories (ie: screen protectors carrying cases etc.) that were widely available I would have no need for a computer or iPhone.

I understand the fact that a tablet is not a PC, however I wanted a smaller version of my PC NOT a large version of my phone.  The blackberry Playbook is great in that I can view almost all websites without any problem what so ever, which was the #1 thing I wanted it for since I am taking classes and most other tablets Including I PAD will not display certain websites correctly. It is large enough to be useful while still being portable so it will fit in pretty much any purse that I own, especially since I am not a big purse kind of person.  Some said the power button is small and troublesome but I do not have any problems with it.  The apps are a little to be desired but has all of the essentials that I needed."}

This is a really good tablet and the price is excellent. It shows videos in High Definition and these can also be connected to a TV or projector to view them on a larger pallet. The battery life is about 10 hours but I had to fully charge and drain the battery before it got to that capacity. The apps are really good and being 7.1 ins it is perfect for reading. All in all I would highly recommend this product. In comparison to the competition you will. not be disappointed."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Update, February 26, 2012: I thought I'd come back to you as RIM has issued the \"2.0\" version of the QNX operating system. Now, above the line, my Playbook has 5 icons that give access to applications that use WiFi, with Blackberry handset-independent databases, while the rest of everything, mostly capable of using the Blackberry Bridge, is below the line. Blackberry Bridge is the connectivity application between the Playbook and a Blackberry phone - contrary to what the press writes, it was there before, but I think its functionality has been expanded, in that you can now use the handset to function as a remote control for the Playbook. It seems a bit silly, but then the Playbook does have an HDMI connector, and that would mean you can run an entire HDMI display off the thing, watch movies in HD on Amazon, while using your phone as a remote control. That's not an application I was desperately waiting for, but perhaps there are others wanting to replace their cable service with the Blackberry combo, if I ever work up the courage I'll try that out for you, but please don't wait up for it. I am getting a little bit out of touch with the things you can do with a smartphone or a tablet, as most of what I see I could do with other tools already, and changing for the heck of it really isn't that exciting to me. In the olden days, you got a truly novel way of doing things, or a completely new thing to do, or a combination of both, but between watching movies in HD on the PC, watching movies in HD on the plasma display from the laptop, watching movies in HD from the tablet, and watching movies in HD on the Tivo, I pretty much have five times more capability than I have bandwidth. Yes, I know we can invent new ways of doing the same thing, but what was hip in the 1980s, is a bit old hat in the 2010s. OTOH, I just explained the whole thing to a friend, and he said: \"That's nice, if that means I could replace the cable box and get the same service, yes, I'd buy that\". Unclutter. See, what do I know.. really.. My opinion is unchanged - best thing since sliced bread if you use a Blackberry handset already - BIS, not BES.\n\nUpdate, February 3, 2012: It's been a month, and I have taken to carrying the Playbook instead of my laptop, when I leave the house - to give you an idea of how special that is, I began carrying a laptop on a daily basis in the mid-1980s (the Radio Shack 100, which I used to write and file stories as a journalist), and it is now 2012. Some 90% of everything I do on my laptop on the road I can do on the Playbook, not a little bit because it is, thanks to its mating with my Blackberry 9700, an always-connected device. No WiFi to find (though both the Playbook and the 9700 can), and so far its battery life, too, has been excellent. I've been down to 65% power, after three full days, but never beyond that. I tend to charge the thing every day, same as my other devices, anyway, but necessary that is not.\n\nORIGINAL: While I felt I really did not have an urgent need for a tablet, I have been dying to try one. Belatedly realizing the Blackberry Playbook was on sale, and because my mainstay work phone has been a Blackberry of one sort or another for decades, I knew I could get some benefits out of the Playbook that other tablets can't give me. The Playbook uses connectivity called the Blackberry Bridge to interconnect the two devices using Bluetooth, and to let the tablet use the handset's wireless internet capability and its databases. Additionally, T-Mobile's UMA service (a,k,a, \"WiFi calling\", a misnomer, available on TMO's Blackberrys) lets me run the pair over a shared WiFi link, reverting to 3G or 4G where no WiFi is available. That means I am good at Barnes & Noble, Starbucks, McDonalds, and many airports. The Blackberry handset is capable of serving the Playbook while still fully usable as a phone and messaging device, multitasking impressively as it goes. For $500 to $600, maybe not, I thought, but for a couple hundred, bring it on. For one thing, the idea of having to configure yet another device, additional to my desktop, laptop and two smartphones (home and work) was a bit beyond what I think is reasonable, and that is what I would have had to do with a \"regular\" tablet. The Playbook, which uses the Blackberry handset settings and applications, solves that conundrum, if that is what it is, handily.\n\nSo, after moderate use of the Playbook for two full days without top-up charging, I found this morning that it had 64% battery left, which is pretty amazing - again, I have this thing running 24/7, and it is online to and via my Blackberry 9700 phone continuously. In other words, it is internet-and-Bluetooth connected all the time, no waiting when I pick it up to read mail or books, no booting, and it does not \"lose its place\" or goes to sleep just as you want to go on reading your news. I don't charge it overnight, because I want to be able to read in bed, and fall asleep without having to worry about putting things in chargers, or even where they are. One nice thing about this tablet is that it is a solid little black slab, nothing protrudes, no moving parts, nothing that can pop out or be dislodged, it should essentially be able to slip my grasp, as books often do when I fall asleep, fall on the carpet, and suffer no harm. I mean, it's an e-thing, right?\n\nSo - I don't charge the Playbook until morning, the idea being I want to quickly top it up while I do email, ablutions, coffee, stuff. If I don't get around to charging, forget, don't have time, no biggie, it'll still be going the next day. The late night reading is what I used to do with books, and want to be able to do with a tablet, sans the reading light. So, interim verdict: this thing is better than expected. By a wide margin, even, and it sharing the 9700's internet is a total Godsend. Not so nice: it needs more charging power than the Blackberry phones do, and so needs its own, more powerful, charger. I like being able to use one charger for different devices, and charge from PC or laptop USB ports, but while the Playbook will run on the \"regular\" charger, it won't actually top up its battery that way, although it will on the Blackberry car adapter. But battery life is vastly better than I expected - let me put it like this: I haven't added something else I need to make sure is charged in the morning - I do with my phones, whether they need it or not, as I am paranoid about a phone dying in the middle of the day, and not being reachable, and the same goes for my laptop, which not only tops up overnight, but needs to run its disk cleanup and virus scanning routines when it isn't being used, then a quick backup in the morning.\n\nI was particularly interested in reading free \"epub\" format books and publications - the Kobo Reader software that comes with the Playbook does not allow this - and as it turns out the online service bookworm.oreilly.com enables reading .epub format freeware. Because the Playbook can be online all the time, either via WiFi or via the Blackberry handset (or both at the same time!), there isn't an issue with having to have an ebook downloaded on the tablet - I have to yet test extensively how well or badly this works when on the road, when your network connection may \"glitch\", but so far I am pleasurably reading a Philip K. Dick (lucky me, I am a scifi aficionado) novel using the Oreilly service, which is free, while Oreilly additionally gives access to \"Feedbooks\", which has public domain, free and paid content. The Blackberry appstore otherwise has plenty of free and paid applications to give the Playbook that little extra. Given that tablets that don't use a major operating system are limited in what they can do, the discounted Playbook provides a cheap alternative to expensive tablets, just to Blackberry handset owners. I personally believe tablets are toys, neither phones nor computers, and as such I suppose RIM has inadvertently created a niche - perhaps they'll get their marketing in gear to where they'll offer a Blackberry handset-Playbook combo, to drive home to the consumer how this was architected in the first place. I should add the Playbook will happily function on just WiFi, or tethered to a non-Blackberry phone, I just have my doubts it'll give you value for money that way, considering it cannot then use the mail and browser databases that are accessible to it if you use it with a Blackberry phone.\n\nMy verdict: if you are a Blackberry phone user already, shop around, the 16 GB version is certainly worth a couple hundred dollars, and as it can use the memory in your Blackberry as well as its own, and can be online to your web server 24/7, I don't know that you need a version with more memory - besides: the less memory, the longer the battery will last."}

The front facing speakers and sound system are excellent. With the PlayBook you can stream music, surf the Internet, download office files and email all at the same time. Battery life is exceptionally great with up to 12 hours or more easily. The browser is fast and I can easily get my email through GMail. A major software upgrade is coming in February and I am already excited by a peek preview of what is to come. There are more than sufficient APPS available from the App Store to satisfy my demands. The Wi-Fi system works great picking up signals wherever you go. The best part about the PlayBook is its size. It fits into a jacket pocket as wel as the pockets of cargo pants. My PlayBook goes wherever I go and I have taken it hiking. The photos from the cameras are also excellent. This is one mother of a piece of technology. I can't say enough good things about it."}

I've wanted a tablet for a long time, but I just couldn't justify spending $400 or $500. When RIM slashed their prices, I jumped on it and I have absolutely no regrets. Previous to purchasing the Playbook I had a Kindle DX, which I used daily, and with the free/low $ books on pixelofink.com, I have a library of over 300 kindle books. After using the Playbook for a couple weeks, I sold my Kindle DX. I read every night before I go to sleep. I would say that the only downside to the Playbook is that I end up surfing the web more than I used to instead of reading. :)\n\nI have found the BB Bridge to be really nice. I mostly use it to check my email, but the browser works fine for surfing, too. The bridge was one of the reason I decided on the PB. Since I'm a BB phone owner, I can surf the web, etc, without buying another data plan for the tablet. I've never used the tethering. For those not familiar, the bridge is very easy to use by just downloading the software to your BB phone and then pairing the phone and tablet via bluetooth.\n\nThe display is really wonderful, great colors and very sharp. The speakers, surprisingly, are also great. I really like to listen to music while I read or surf, so the quality of the speakers is a big plus. There are several nice apps for streaming music on Appworld, many free.\n\nSeveral people mentioned that, as of now, there's no Kindle App, which is true. I chose to use the Kindle Cloud reader. It's not quite as full featured as the Kindle App on my Blackberry phone, or my former Kindle DX, but I'm happy with it. Plus, with the new OS in Feb, we are supposed to have access to the Android apps, which includes one for Kindle.\n\nI like to go on Facebook on the PB. I don't use the supplied app, instead I just use the browser. With that it looks just like you'd see on your computer, and I like it better than the app.\n\nI've not experienced any problems or complaints with my battery. I like to have the cradle in the kitchen or my office, and then I can stream some really nice music while I work. BTW, I bought my PB as a bundle, and it included the 32gb PB, rapid charger and the cradle charge and convertible case. The accessories are all oem. The case is really nice because it protects the PB, and surprisingly I use all three of the chargers."}

If your like me and and travel quite a bit and prefer your 1.5T/12G 27\" desktop when your at home, use your employers eqipment at work and you only require a tablet for when you're on the go, you really can't go wrong with the Playbook, especially if you're already a current model Blackberry phone user.\n\nPros:\nBuild quality & reliability (I've had no issues). Genuine multi-tasking capabilities. No hassle wifi support. Super sound quality from the front speakers. Excellent browser: most web pages and all mobile versions load quickly & consistently.

This is coming from a person who currently owns a Windows Phone 7, an Android Phone, and an iPad 2.  I bought the Playbook with much hesitation and little expectation.  The $299 price convinced me to get it.  Now, I'm happy I got it.  I love the 7-inch screen size.  It's so much more comfortable to hold and thus, more portable than the iPad 2.  The Playbook doesn't have mobile broadband, only WiFi; so I have to use my cell phone's WiFi Hotspot to connect it to the Internet.  Not a big deal.  The biggest drawback is Blackberry's AppWorld, which does not offer a few apps I would like to have such as Words With Friends and Google Voice.  I think RIM has an awesome mobile OS, better than iOS and Android.  They just need to attract more 3rd party support."}

Then I found the volume is too low. I have to put in the Max position all the time when I watch Amazon instant movies. The speaker sounds poor. Not just too low to hear, but poor quality. The Amazon silk for the Web Browsing is painful to use, feel too much framed, more like a handhold device, such as a smart phone. touch response is not always work. hard to check battery level ... etc. I called Amazon customer service about the volume problem, but someone suggested me to use earpiece. After the call, I decided to return it. For Kindle Fire, it may have a good hardware except speaker part, but poor software user interface except for Amazon.com part. I'm not going to keep a device just for shopping with Amazon.com. I can not even watch Amazon's instant video comfortably due to the cheap speaker. Additional, the 5GB storage is too small to use. It is useless and nothing to do with my original plan.\n\nI bought a 64GB Playbook from blackberry website this month with a very good price. It exceed my expectations for both of hardware and software sides. when I do Web Browsing, compare with a phone like Kindle Fire, it's more like a normal high end laptop with pretty high speed. just smaller size and easier to carry during the trip than the laptop, the tool bar on the screen is very easy to use and hide, well designed user interface, quick touch response, because of the interface, I feel Playbook having a much bigger screen during web browsing than the Kindle Fire. Great hardware, very well built, great display quality and great SPEAKER quality. 64GB is big enough for me to load some movies during the trip. I tried to play some .flv and .f4v video files without any problem after I bought a $0.99 app MovieFlvPlayer. I feel missing the most is there is no Skype app yet. I wish it will come very soon. Then it will be a perfect device for my original goal. Camera, game and GPS parts are the bonus for me, ( I haven't try GPS yet). Only $100 more than the Kindle Fire. A supper great buy!

And I definitely have to sit by my Windows Laptop/PC when I need browse websites extensively and seriously.\n\nOk, here is my personal experience which I'd like to share:\n\nWhat I like (relative to other tablets):\n\n(1). The form factor. It is portable in reality, yet with workable/watchable screen size. Even it is only 0.9lb and 0.4inch thin, I hope, in the future, all tablets can be made lighter (say 0.1-0.2lb) and thinner (0.1-0.2 inch) if possible at all. For now, this playbook is the best for my personal preference;\n\n(2). The web surfing. The browser is very professional and extremely fast. It loads webpages EXACTLY THE SAME as a Windows PC does. No sacrifice being a tablet. This is the first tablet in it's class. Why other tablets couldn't have done the same thing? I don't understand;\n\n(3). The multitasking. I like to have a music or video playing in the background while surfing the web.\n\n(4). The high build quality and low profile looking. It's neat and looks just like a regular book when put in case. Very well built and very low profile in appearance.\n\n(5). The price. Moving forward, $299 will be what I'm willing to pay for a top level quality tablet.\n\nWhat need to be clarified:\n\n(1). Blackberry Bridge Vs. Internet tethering.\n  When you have Bridge setup with your blackberry smartphone, the  Playbook is nothing but a display. So, everything you seem to \"run\" on Playbook is FREE because in reality, it is your smartphone is running. I found in a couple reviews, reviewers said there is a charge from AT&T for Playbook. That is because those reviewers were using internet tethering, not Bridge, on their Playbooks. I google'd and found the following link to be useful in solving the confusion:\n<[...]>\n\n(2). Apps. I downloaded about 20 apps for kids to play when we were out. I don't feel I am limited in any case. If you would like to be immersed by 1,000,000 available apps but in reality you only need 300, then you will have to keep your iPad for the best possibility. One question to ask: there are millions of songs generated each year, how many songs do you really listen to?\n\nWhat I don't like:\n\nPlaybook OS 2.0 (with native email, calendar, and contact) didn't come with it.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I recently bought this from the manufacturer on sale.  I have been looking at various notebooks for a while but no way would I pay $600 (I got the 32 GB) for any of them.  I really wanted it for travel so I would not need to take my laptop with me and didn't necessarily need to find a wi-fi hotspot on the road.  I chose the playbook for a couple of reasons--1)  I really like the size of it (about as big as a half-sheet of paper)very easily fits in my purse 2) I liked the idea that you could tether it to your Blackberry phone for data (the idea, of course, being that I didn't have to buy a separate data plan.)  That second reason for buying it is why I am only giving it 3 stars--what they don't tell you (or, at least I never saw anywhere, is that you have to PAY EXTRA to tether it to your phone for data (or at least with ATT you do)--so much for not having to buy another plan!!  I don't know yet how much as I haven't had to travel since getting it and have just been using it with wi-fi, I just thought I'd try it and that is how I discovered the need for an extended plan.  This is fairly annoying to me!!  Otherwise, I do like it, it does easily sync information (like notepad, etc) with the phone and if you're on a wi-fi network, connects and browses well on the internet.  As other reviewers noted, it is a little short on apps but there are still quite a few--enough anyway to make me happy enough and my kids have had great fun playing on it.  So anyway, even if I end up not paying extra to tether to my phone to it, I guess it can provide entertainment when we're traveling!  Just thought a little heads up on the data plan would be nice.\n\n**update**  haven't tried this yet but another reviewer recommended looking at crackberry.com/playbook-bridge to get around the tethering issue.  I looked at it and think that will probably work for me.  If it does I will likely be back to raise my rating to 4 or maybe even 5 stars.  This really is a neat little item!\n\n**more update**well, I've tried several workarounds to this issue none of which worked for me.  Probably who I should ding is ATT not the playbook but anyway this isn't going to work for right now the way I wanted it to so I'm not really happy either way. ATT customers, at least, need to be aware of this issue.  (BTW $45/mo tethering plan w/ATT IN ADDITION TO (the way I understand it) your regular data plan.  BS"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "With the current deep discount, you can't go wrong particularly if you are a BB phone user.  My wife bought me a 32GB for my birth day and I decided to get 4 more.  One for another personal use so that I and my wife can connect.  The rest are for company use.  Depending on your need, you may find PB has no real use if you are into apps to run through your day.  However, only a handful of currently available paid and free apps, I find it very helpful for my daily need both personal and at work.\n\nHere is my short review.\n\nPros:\nSize, I find it to be just a sweet spot to lug it around.  For any short business trip, I have been successfully leaving my laptop behind.\nSpecs, for its current discounted prices, you can't find anything close to it.  It has 2 HD cameras front and back.  Of course, 5MP front and 8MP back would be nice, but it is good enough.  It has flash and support html5.  Being Amazon prime member, I am really happy being able to stream movie directly with my PB.  The list goes on, but last but not least, its multi-tasking is above average.  Higher memory to 2GB would be super nice, but it has yet frozen or crashed on me.\nBB Bridge, some may find this less appealing, but I love it and look forward to the OS2 release.  Check the 2012 CES report and you will understand what I am referring to.\n\nCons:\nApps, again it is a toss up depending on what you are looking for.  So you know what you are going into.  This is not iPad or Android apps market.  Study and see if it fits ya.\nSW, it needs an update really bad.  Currently, it lacks native file browser, languages support (South East Asia, for example), spelling checking, etc.  But the new OS should address most of these.\n\nI should also note that I do not like the charing setup via micro usb.  I have seen a few displays at a few shops in town with broken micro usb and the thing stuck to the device!  I am sure it was due to the abuse from potential client, but thought that I mention it.  Last but not least, the power button seems to have issue and its depends. Some unit will have a really flush power button making it hard to use.\n\nIf you are a doubter and know that you do not need hundreds apps to get your job done, give it a whirl.  You will be impress."}

I used the Bridge app, browser, and even long-distance video chat. So far I think (after the price cuts), its a great value for money. It has top-notch hardware and the screen quality is awesome. The App World has a decent collection of apps at this point and its growing. A massive update (OS2) is coming in a couple of months or earlier, and that will add more apps.\n\nFor browsing, I downloaded the free \"Simple Browser\" which works faster than the default one."}

I love the Blackberry Bridge which allows me to look at pics and files on my Blackberry Torch smartphone.  Using the BB forums I learned that when I have a pic up on my Playbook I can press the -/+ buttons on the top, get a snapshot of the pic and it saves to my PB library.  I can also use the \"tethering\" function and get internet connectivity through my smartphone!  I can link up to my PC wirelessly with my PB and upload and download files never leaving my sofa or interrupting hubby while he's on the computer.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "The Playbook has many positives, including a beautiful sleek design; perfect not too big, not too small, not too heavy size; awesome picture; sensitive screen; and fast processor; however, IT'S GOT NO APPS!!!\n\nTo give you some perspective on where I'm coming from: I'm a regular guy.  Not a computer geek, or a multiple phone/computer/tablet having \"techie\"; I do \"average\" computing things, like internet browsing, email, spread sheeting, movie watching, music/audiobook listening, playing games, playing game/learning apps for my kids,... stuff like that.\n\nFrom a physical standpoint, the small power button is probably the biggest problem I can think of; and for that, its not as much of a problem as others have written about; it does cause a problem for me at work because I somehow manage to turn it on accidentally while I hold it in a wide jacket pocket as I'm walking around; this of course leads to battery issues...  I don't think that's a universal problem though.  For music, it's pretty standard in terms of its specs.  For music apps, it, of course, it is limited in terms of music potential, though it does have Slacker radio, and it has no Audible app (no big surprise).\n\nThere just simply isn't enough available with this device.  The lack of access to the Android Marketplace is problem #1, 2, and 3.  The Blackberry App Store is a joke, albeit a sad one, directed at you.  Many apps specified for use out of the US, which is of no benefit to me here in the states.\n\nIt really is a beautiful device, however, unless you want to pay a lot of $$$ for a pretty screen that you can only web browse, facebook, and do email on, you'd be wise to spend your money on something else, virtually anything else."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I waited almost a year before getting the 64GB Blackberry Playbook.  In Jan 2012 Blackberry put it on sale for $299, a $400 drop in price.  Since I am a Blackberry diehard who has had one since the monochrome sidewheel days and my whole family is on Blackberry devices I figured that it would fit nicely in my ecosystem.\n\nBefore purchasing it, even at 57% off the regular price I laid out some reasons for buying it:\n1) Play audio\n2) Play video\n3) Browse web\n4) Use Blackberry Bridge to do emails to stop hurting my Blackberry thumb!\n\nI received it on Friday and here's how it went:\n\n1) Audio: It won't play about 5% of my MP3s.  The screen shows that it is progressing through the song yet there is no audio.\n2) Video: It won't play about 30% of my videos.  None of the .MKV videos work and some of the .AVIs won't work at all while others show a silent movie that I attribute back to whatever it is that won't play audio files.\n3) The fastest loading page on the web is arguably the Google home page at [...]  On the Playbook this page takes 3-4 minutes to load with the Playbook within arm's length of the wireless router. The Playbook is touted for having Flash support but only after I turned Flash off and JavaScript off would Google load in a few seconds.\n4) Blackberry Bridge: Doesn't work for me. Although this not working may be attributable to my using a Blackberry that's a few years old and doesn't have as much memory as the latest, the bottom line is that it still didn't work because my Blackberry phone did not have enough memory to run the required software and I'm not about to go out and buy a new Blackberry phone just to make the Playbook work.\n\nand more\n\n5) Screen sensitivity: Almost half the time the screen would not respond to my finger swipes and pokes.  Very frustrating.  This reminds me of when I first excitedly tried the Blackberry Storm and the onscreen phone dialpad would not recognize pokes at the \"3\" digit...for 20 minutes straight.  But that's a different review.\n\n6) App World: I downloaded just about all the free programs I was vaguely interested in - a dozen.  I then ran out of anything else to get.\n\nIt's now Monday and not only is this going back, but its time to move to Android for phones etc."}

The Playbook looks great, works great, and is much easier to work with than my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, which I sold after I bought this.  I realize there is some risk in backing a device and a company that seems on its way down, but I'm happy enough with just the browser and ability to check email to make it worth the much-reduced price...if RIM delivers on its promise that better things are ahead, this is going to turn out to be a steal.  No matter what, if you're daring enough, you can install and run Android apps on the Playbook now that the technologically-savvy have posted how-to guides all over the internet.\n\nBottom line: Best tablet I've seen.

Plus, the lack of a Kindle app is remedied by the Kindle Cloud Reader, which works flawlessly on the Playbook.\n\nIf you use a Blackberry phone, this is definitely the tablet to get. The Bridge capability turns your cell phone into a mobile hotspot so you're never without WiFi. Even without a Blackberry phone, if you want a tablet for productivity purposes the Playbook is an excellent choice.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "First of all - I like the Playbook. I don't love it (which would have been a 5 star). In short - the hardware is nice, feels good, seems of high quality. The software is limited and lacks some of the features that I would like to see. I am not an expert user and also non-ideological when it comes to brands (Apple vs. Android vs. RIM). I am a long time user of Blackberry smartphones and really like them. I was thinking about a tablet for a long time and jumped on the Playbook mostly due to the good price and the size.\n\nI find the name of the tablet fitting - Playbook. This is exactly what this device is good for. It's a nice extension to my laptop and my smartphone that I will continue to take on my travels. That's why I prefer the smaller size of the Playbook over the bigger iPad. I am sure the iPad is a great device and from all I hear and have experienced myself, it has superior touch and feel and certainly more applications than the Playbook. That's probably my biggest critizism of the Playbook. Apps are limited and I am mostly missing Google Maps and Skype functionality. I like the Blackberry Bridge functionality that allows for accessing emails on the tablet, but I cannot e.g. download attachments. This seems to be a bug connected to the Blackberry Enterprise server software, something I unfortunately have no influence on. So I am really waiting for that Operating System upgrade that RIM is promising and that is announced for Feb 2012.\n\nIn summary, what I like:\n+ Size\n+ Price\n+ High quality touch and feel\n+ Speed (e.g. browser speed is great!)\n+ video/photo quality\n\nWhat I don't like:\n- Limited apps (no google maps, no skype,...)\n- waiting for OS upgrade\n\nI would recommed the Playbook if you are looking for a handy extra device for mostly... play. It's not a replacement for laptop or smartpone (as none of the tablets are in my opinion)."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I first bought the 32 gb model from Best Buy, and it had a dead pixel on the screen.  I spent about 90 minutes with blackberry's customer service on the phone, and they offered to replace it but first had me reinstall the software, twice.  They thought that somehow this would fix a dead pixel.  Anyway, who has hours to waste on the phone?  I don't.  Then I couldn't get any laptop in the house to recognize the device properly.  No issues with any other USB devices.  Anyway they had me delete and reinstall the same version of their blackberry desktop software, which took another hour or so.  No dice, still can't recognize it properly.  It could be my laptop, but again I've had no problems with other devices.  I was able to install 1 movie on it, and although the quality was very good on my laptop it wasn't that clear on the blackberry.  Not sure why because the preinstalled sample 3 minute movie is super clear with very high resolution.  After this movie was installed, nothing else would install, and my laptop wouldn't recognize it again.  It was sort of a fluke that it worked.\n\nI returned it to Best Buy and got my money back.  They were sold out due the deep price reduction.  Then I bought the 64 gb model off Amazon, no dead pixels but still can't get it to work with my laptop, maybe the issue is with my laptop.  As far as the device is concerned it has a lightning fast internet browser, probably as fast as my laptop for most sites.  The camera was okay, but I used it indoors: may work better outdoors in sunlight.  The preinstalled car racing game wasn't very good, in my opinion. If you are curious about the sound I thought the speakers worked really well for the size of this tablet.  Unfortunately, and I knew this going in it doesn't do Netflix or Skype and there are very few apps that you can get right now.  If I could get my own movies to load on this, I might consider keeping it.  But I'd rather spend a few hundred more and get something that does what I want it to do.  If you don't care about Netflix or Skype and you can get it to work with your computer then it might be right for you.  Pretty good price, very nice screen and fast internet over wifi.  Last thing as noted by many other reviewers is the power button. It didn't seem too bad on the 32 gb model, but on this 64 gb it's really difficult to turn it off and on with the power button.  Yes you can swipe to wake up the tablet, but there will be times you will be forced to power on or off with the button, and it's annoying.  I thought others were just whining about silly things, but this is quite a pain.  By the way I bought the \"used\" model from Amazon's Warehouse deals and I'm pretty sure it's brand new.  No signs that the box had ever been opened.  So if you are going to buy one, be confident in Amazon's \"like new\" warehouse deal, as it may actually be brand new, and you get some good savings."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I decided on this tablet as a last minute Christmas gift during the fire sale that was offered by a name brand electronics store toward the end of December.  Yes I read the reviews about how the tablet was good but wasn't \"ready for prime time\" blah blah but with competing models running more than twice the cost I figured, why not?  You can also read a myriad of critcisim on it suggesting how it can't be any good because of its app shortcomings and you'll need to wait until OS 2.0 for it to be anywhere near competative.  Anyone remember waiting for iOS 1.1.5 or even 2.0 on your IPhone to address bugs, push e-mail, etc?  Guess that's ok though... sheesh.\n\nI've had it now for about a week and have gotten very used to the form and feel of it as a whole.  It's solidly built and feels good in your hands.  Overall, I'd say RIM has the makings of a huge winner and here's why:\n\nPerformance - Simply unbelievable.  Multi-tasking is flawless.  Play an HD video, surf the web, open a few documents, the thing won't skip a beat.  The interface is a pleasure to use with bezel gesturing for simple commands.  Want to minimize your app?  Swipe from the bottom bezel upward through the screen.  Want to bring down the options bar?  Swipe from the top bezel down.  Similar functions for scrolling and moving through apps in multi-tasking mode can be done from the left and right as well.  There's also diagonal bezel swiping to bring up things like the keypad, status bar etc.  Oh, and these functions are also mirrored whether you hold the tablet in portrait or landscape.  Really cool.\n\nGraphic diplay - Beautiful.  Rich full colors with nice high definition.  Love it.\n\nCustomization - Good but needs a little work.  I'm hoping that OS 2.0 will address this.  Right now, you can move icons into different pre set categories for 'Games' 'Media' 'Blackberry Bridge' etc. but currently there's no way to setup your own.  Really a minor gripe but there it is.  There's also no sound customization beeps and boops but I'm not sure that's even a necessity. After all, it doesn't have a ringer does it? Of course, you can change wallpaper and all of the typical stuff that goes with that.\n\nApps - One of the biggest complaints with this has been the lack of apps.  They add more by the day on Blackberry App World and with guaranteed Android support in OS 2.0 I have no doubt I'll be downloading a plethora of fart apps in another month or two.  Can't wait (sarcasm intended).\n\nCompatability - Android coming in OS 2.0, currently supports flash, HTML5, Plays MP3s, WMA, and I'm sure others.  Can't comment on video format or other audio format yet as I haven't tried those but I can't imagine that others that might not be supported yet won't be soon.\n\nVideo - Records in 1080p and outputs the same by micro HDMI to your HDMI TV.  Simply awesome.  The thing can also mirror its display on your television for a much richer viewing experience.\n\nCamera - Dual cameras fore and aft.  5mp rear and 3mp (I think) front.  Has a video chat function which I haven't tried yet since currently, it only works with other Playbook users.  I understand that there might be third party apps that can be used so that may not be an issue.  Pic quality is about what you'd expect.  Not that it's bad, it's not, it just isn't that good in low light conditions.  I know, what do you expect, right?  With a well lit subject, it's fantastic but just a slight low light condition and it gets grainy.  The Playbook does not have a camera flash which is a particular gripe of mine.  However, since this isn't a primary camera for me or my family, maybe it's not such a concern after all.  Still deciding on that one.  Camera settings are a little lame too.  Auto, Whiteboard, and Sports.  There's also a stabilization button but not much else.\n\nForm factor - Love, repeat, love the 7\" screen.  You can put the tablet in your pocket, carry it around with you easily and read text very very well.\n\nBridging - Another criticism of the tablet is that it accuses RIM of only catering to current Blackberry phone owners by not providing native communications software for e-mailing, texting, calendar, etc.  I would have to agree with this one and consider this to be  RIMs biggest mistake which likely helped lead to poor market sales.  I do use a Blackberry so this doesn't affect me but OS 2.0 is supposed to incorporate all of the native ware that everyone is he*l bent on.  Speaking on behalf of bridge users everywhere though, I can attest to its genius in that it's seamless and simple to use. Although the software is basically stripped down versions of the apps used on the Blackberry, the fact that you can leave your phone in the kitchen while you hold your office on your lap is a treat.  You can also use it to bridge to your Blackberry web browser (more on this in a bit).  I do have some gripes about some of the functionality of the bridging apps which are missing key features like spell check or some expected intuitiveness.  Overall though, they work very well for what they do.\n\nCommunication - Another critical issue with reviewers has been that this tablet is only WiFi.  Again, since I have a Blackberry, I can tether to the internet through the phone so I have complete internet access when I'm out of Wifi range.  No biggie for me.  Plus I don't need an extra data plan to use it.  Bluetooth A2DP coming in OS 2.0.  WiFi good and strong without any dropouts.\n\nBattery Life - Don't really know.  I'd say with heavy use, maybe 5 hours.  Light use more like 10?  Either way, seems on par with everything else that's out there.\n\nTyping - Good.  Responsive and easy to do, just need that spell checky/auto correct thingy and we'll be good to go. OS 2.0\n\nInternet experience - Without a doubt, the best.  The experience is the same as if you were sitting at your PC.  Flash is flashy, HTML5 is HTML5'y. In short it's what mobile (not really mobile anymore) surfing should be like.  In fact, it's so good that many apps for missing loaders that people are complaining about become unnecessary since they can just be accessed through direct web experience.  Not true of all, but many.\n\nThings I'd like to see and, my understanding is most will be addressed in OS 2.0 (due out in February last I heard):\n\n- Software improvements to some of the bridge apps to make them a little more intuitive.\n- A2DP Bluetooth\n- Android compatibility should open the door up for most apps\n- Many companies are still loathe to develop apps for the Playbook.  Netflix, Pandora, and Goole Maps come to mind.  However, they can all be made to work by direct net access or, in the case of Netflix, by streaming to a PC and then your Playbook but the Android issue should address this.\n- A little more customization of categories, naming icons, avatars, etc.  I understand that you'll be able to add quick links to contacts and such in OS 2.0 for instance.\n\nIn conclusion, I really think RIM has a winner.  It's too bad that the tablet has been panned so badly by critics which is partly due to RIMs poor marketing strategy, no native e-mail, early release of a product that likely wasn't quite ready yet and some good ol' fashioned RIM bashing, but I pay less attention to them and rely more on user input instead.  Most of the user reviews you read are very positive about this system and for good reason which is what attracted me to it.  I can't compare it to other tablets such as the Galaxy or the IPad since I haven't owned either.  I've dabbled on the IPad a bit and it seems every bit as rock solid and well thought out. Given the two however the price point speaks loudly.  $600 vs. $250?  Mmmm, I'm pretty happy with my choice.\n\nI ranked this tablet as a 4 star.  I have no doubt that when OS 2.0 comes out in February that most of my wants list will be addressed.  I'd then have no problem pushing it to 5."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Confession: Bought PB 16GB without looking into specs or reviews just going by the price tag and experience so far with my BB 8520\n\nOverall Satisfaction: Very Very Good.\n\nPB First look: Exceptional. Holds and feels amazing. Saying this after having held most of the tabs. Xoom was bad. Feels heavier than other 10\" tabs, over-heated and not so good build quality. Galaxy, didn't enjoy the touchpad. Feels a generation behind iPad. iBall slide, don't even want to talk about it. Reliance tab little better than Slide but way inferior to PB/iPad. My bro has a 7\" Galaxy even that is below par against PB and iPad. So as you know if I ever would have bought a tab it would have been ipad or BB. Unknowingly I made the right decision for the price cut.\n\nTHE GOOD\nScreen Size: Wow. This came in as a huge surprise for me. Did I think 7\" tab would be better? No. Never. Bigger the better - is usually the thing for me. Not this time. After using for 2 days and ipad for a similar duration. 7\" is the RIGHT size. At least for me. Just enough. 10\" is way big\n\nScreen Clarity: Awesome. You can't beat iPad for that. So I would put this next best to it. Feels very good. Nice and bright. Good colors, clarity. Loved the pictures and HD video sample. Waiting to watch HD movies on PB\n\nTouch screen & keyboard: I wasn't a touch screen fan until PB. Works so very well for me on this device. Very very cool. Works better for me than an iPad.\n\nWeb browsing: Fast and furious. Works on any site I threw at it. Unlike ipad or galaxy\n\nSetup: Easiest ever I had to. Believe me. Including the BB bridging from Curve 8520 took just 10 mins. Yeah the 1st boot required a 357MB auto update but amazingly downloading is very fast on PB. Never the felt the same on my Laptop. Especially the apps from AppWorld installed way fast!\n\nBB Bridging: Works like cream. Efficient and productive.\n\nWifi: Works as good as on your laptop if not better.\n\nSpeakers: Very good for a tablet. Front facing and crisp music\n\nOS: The best you can get. I am loving QNX. Very fast, responsive and nimble. Better than Android and iOS. Little unstable with a few app crashes when lots is loaded but I think it would resolve with future updates.\n\nTHE OK\nCamera/Video: Yet to click outdoors. Indoors morning was ok. Not a digi cam replacement. Night indoors/outdoors was bad. So I might move this to bad category based on how it pans out in outdoors in day. My guess is it would be ok as my wifey's mobile is good at that as well\n\nTethering: I have a EDGE on 8520. It is slow on my phone too. But via PB it was a little bad. Hits and misses. Don't know where the problem is. My guess it is a s/w issue.\n\nBB Phone Browser: Out of the box. No extra setup. Works alright. Yet to play more with it.\n\nTHE BAD\nApps: No email app. No Kindle app. Damn not even a twitter, gmail and yahoo app. I am not a apps geek. or a heavy user. So it's kind of ok for me. It has an FB app and some decent other apps. I see the app store growing though. Once Android player is out, it will be better. But who knows if it ever will. So if you are an app junkie. BE CAUTIOUS\n\nYET TO TRY: Battery life"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I totally understand that there are a lack of apps for this machine.  This will change with a new OS update that will incorporate thousands of Android apps, coupled with the recent fire sale of Playbooks.\n\nLets start off where this tablet dominates.\nMultimedia.  This tablet has the best video playback and recording (1080p) of any other device I have used, including the iPad.\n\nUI.  The Playbook QNX based OS is ridiculous, you can run 20 different programs, videos, games, etc, simultaneously and they will not even slow down a bit.  The buttonless swipe navigation one ups the iPads single button navigation in simplicity of design.\n\nPortability.  I can bring this device anywhere I go, no problem.\n\nBuild quality.  This thing feels like rock-solid, much more so than any other tablet out there.\n\nBlackberry bridge.  If you own an iPad and an iPhone, you still either have to pay for a 3g plan for your iPad or you are limited to wi-fi areas.  With the Playbook and a Blackberry smartphone, you have internet, for no additional cost (provided you have an unlimited data play, as I do).  I can easily access all of my emails, calendar, etc.  When someone is calling me, a pop-up notification alerts me with the Caller ID information (which I love).\n\nWeb browsing.  Due to seamless flash, Adobe AIR, and HTML5 integration, you can watch HD online video content on most websites (it is capable of video playback on virtually all sites, but some have blocked the content on this device, for reasons which I do not understand).  Sports highlights, streaming tv episodes, etc.\n\nGraphics.  One realm that is well supported in the App World is gaming.  Games like Madden NFL 12, Dead Space, and the list goes on, all have the BEST 3d graphics of any mobile device on the market.\n\nTo summarized and address the lack of apps.  I thought it would be a big issue at first, and I hesitated to buy it.  I was incorrect.  Let me ask you a question.  When you use your desktop PC or laptop, are you bothered that there is no native facebook app (the Playbook had one before iPad, but I never use it)?  Or twitter app?  Do you find it to tedious to log in to news websites like Huffington Post, Time, or CNN?  Of course not.  Those companies don't need to develop native PC or Mac OS applications, because they have full featured websites.  They are bookmarks on your browser.  As I mentioned earlier, I never use the native facebook app. Facebook is a website, and the best way to experience it is as a web page.  The Playbook renders all of the websites you love just as it would on your desktop PC.  You can scroll through submenus on with your thumb, you can pinch to zoom many map websites.  Integrated multimedia plays back as it would on your browser.  You can play all of your favorite online flash-based games.  There is no reason to use a native app for most of these content providers, as the online version is superior.\n\nHere is a case in point to finish it off.  I live in the Minneapolis area.  the iPad and iPhone both offer an app to consume their content.  On my desktop, I use the web to access what is called the \"electronic edition\" of the newspaper.  It displays the actual print version of the paper, with clickable articles and zoom, and a great user interface to navigate through the paper.  I far prefer it to the website content.  The apps for the Star Tribune simply format the same content on the website for your device.  Since neither one of those has flash capabilities, they cannot run the electronic edition of the newspaper.  Android devices can load the electronic edition, but the flash is half-baked and the navigation features don't work properly, rendering it useless.  On my playbook, I can read the print edition of my favorite paper from anywhere I like, including non-wi-fi covered areas.\n\nI am not saying it is superior to other tablets in every way, but it has many advantages, and with the release of the new OS, those will only be amplified.  I suggest you pick one up immediately (especially if your a blackberry owner.  If not, seriously consider switching to Blackberry because their new generation of smartphones is as underrated as this tablet is) -- You will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Got for xmas....love it.  Wanted a tablet/ipad for awhile but didn't want to shell out too much money.  Also wanted to make sure it worked for me and what I wanted it to do.  I like and respect the ipad but strongly dislike the lack of compatibility (hdmi, usb) and multitasking (open new tabs easily, have multiple programs running).  Apple makes great products, but as an \"intermediate tech guy\" i want more!!!  So looked elsewhere....asus, acer, blackberry because of compatibility.\n\nPros:\nSize - personally i love the 7\", smart phone too small, 10\" a lil much.  Can put in my jeans back pocket, not a perfect fit, but keyword is fit.\n\nMultitasking - awesome. (you can read that as \"awesome period\"). Really is great.  All windows/applications run in the background (option to turn off if desired i.e. window/app will still be up but not running).  Swipe and go to the next.\n\nCompatibility - acts essentially as an external hard drive.  Micro-usb to usb in computer (cord included), click and drag files. Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint on playbook preinstalled!!  Adobe for pdfs!!  I put all my old notes from college on it to try, perfect, you can open all those file types and edit them (and can have each open in their own windows too!!).  Note: playbook doesn't have preinstalled files/folders navigation for some reason, but can get free or $1-2 app's to do this, then just like a comp, open/navigate files/folders.\n\nHDMI - honestly haven't tried yet but i'm sure that's fine....should prob check though.\n\nBlackberry Bridge - don't have a blackberry phone but if you do, this feature seems cool.\n\nCons:\nPower button - Small.....but responsive and not that bad.  very manageable.\n\nApps - not as expansive as ipad/android but adequate.  Note:  in feb 2011 android app compatibility is coming to the public (available now if you know what you're doing - demo/test 2.0 version out.....googled it)\n\nApple, Android, and RIM (research in motion, blackberry) are the real tablet choices.  All are solid.  I went with and am pleased with RIM.  Not as big of market share, but they are in it and have a dedicated following to pump out apps and updates.  I could go on about how much I enjoy this tablet but I can't add anymore chapters to this novel, even though i'd like too :)\n\nReal review.  My \"educated\" opinion/evaluation.  It's a cool toy and a practical machine for work."}

Forums at crackberry.com very extremely useful in helping me get the most out of its functionality and I have more to delve in to.  7 inch size is perfect for portability.  I have a BB phone so am able to bridge the PB to my phone for internet connection when there is no wi-fi available without increasing monthly cost.  It can run websites with flash which not all tablets can do.  the browser lets you have multiple tabs open and you can also have multiple programs open at once to be able to multitask.  It has HD video with stereo sound which no other tablet has.  I can load books and movies on it to keep me occupied on long flights.  I expect to use the HDMI out to use when making presentations using their slideshow to go.  I used the rear camera on vacation recently for both photo and video and the quality was excellent.  Looking forward to using the front camera soon.  All in all, very pleased with my purchase.  Again, crackberry.com playbook forums has lots of helpful hints to get the most out of the PB.  It takes more time setting up than a simple e-reader but has much much more power and potential than that as well."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "First off, I admit I have ordered this from RIM directly where it was $199. I wish I HAD ordered it from Amazon. At this point, I have a shipping confirmation, my account has been charged- but saw a post (possibly here) for whom the same sequence of events transpired, yet did  not receive the product. In trying to ascertain if this will be the case for me, I made futile attempts to contact Customer Support. You cannot get a human, and the recording said my purchase number was too long! To make matters worse, emails from RIM are not delivered-just a robot email for various blackberry phone issues, plus directions to a forum and FAQ.  I cannot get my order cancelled even! Frankly, after what I have experienced plus viewing the reviews here-I hope it never arrives. I do not want to purchase equipment that the company does not stand behind, or \"hides.\"\nRIM seems to have a reputation as a well-made product, but it appears from other posters that is a false assumption on my part. If it ever does arrive, I will post an update. But be forewarned- Customer Support is hideously bad.\n  Update: I did receive it, in 10 days. I am very glad I did not pay full price for this, as it won't do much. The camera takes decent photos, but they cannot be exported anywhere. It was my understanding there was a USB port (so I could download photos from my camera)- there is not. No photos out; no photos in. It cannot play any films from my Photobucket website; it also cannot play streaming audio from WLAC dot com. There is no app for kindle. I had purchased this to take on vacation, as the iPad is too big. Now sure what to do now. About the only good things I can say about this involves the hardware: the size is perfect; the picture is superb. Downloading sometimes takes 5 minutes for some sites; other sites load faster than my iPod touch. It seems like a quality-built product whose software is sorely lacking. There is an update coming out next month which is said to enable it to run android programs. But I doubt that it will come in time for my vacation; so for now its just an expensive paperweight. I now give it 2 stars for its durable constraction and nonskid surface."}

A $500 ipad would have been a waste, for me, because I would still use it mainly for web browsing only.  And the flash abilities with the Playbook make it amazing for youtube and such...etc.  As for the apps, you can find apps the generally fit your needs, although they may not be brand name.  I just love the size as I can usually just watch stuff in bed until I doze off.  However, I wish the battery life was a bit better.  There is a basic version of Word, PowerPoint, and Excel that I find useful.  An email client would be nice along with a personalized calendar and the android market...but don't expect it becuase I think RIM is about to tank....so just get this clearance tablet for the cheap price...its totally worth it.\n\nOverall, I am very pleased."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I know there are alot of reviews out there about the drawbacks of this device, but they are completely wrong and biased. This is hands down the best tablet on the market today. Just check out the specs on a number of websites an you'll see I'm right. It is on equal ground with the IPAD in most respects and outperforms it in many others. Now, there are a few things that RIM(Blackberry) failed to incorporate into this tablet... ie.. dedicated mail server, access to the android market place and a few other minor issues, but RIM is in the process of fixing those few drawbacks. As of now, it will hace the update out Feb. of 2012. And besides, the mail issue is not that big of a deal, there is already a preloaded link to Yahoo, Gmail and AOL mail and it takes me about 5 seconds to access any of my email accounts. Give RIM a chance to fix the minor issues and this will be your favorite tablet. Oh, the size is a personal preference matter. I like the smaller more portable aspect of the playbook, I can take it anywhere without it being a hinderence."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I bought this as a blind buy and wasn't really sure what to expect.  With that being said, I absolutely love my Playbook.  The only issue I had was I was really expecting the Playbook operating system to be similar to my Blackberry phone and its not.  However the learning curve is pretty quick and if you've every used WebOS or some Android phones its very, very similar and basically consists of flipping through windows and flicking your finger up or down on the pad to bring up options or to close windows.\n\nThe best thing about the device is that is 100% supports Flash.  This means you can watch videos on most websites, including Amazon.  Likewise, the web browser that is built in is likewise fantastic and maybe the best mobile browser I've ever used (it reminds me a lot of the Opera Mini browser I use on my phone, but even easier to use).\n\nI do have a few complaints about the PB however.\n1.  There app selection is a little slender.  If you need an app for something you can probably find it, it just want be the name brand app your friends have on their android or IOS devices.\n2.  Netflix and HULU do not play on the device (though again, Amazon works just fine)\n3.  There is NO email client built into the device, which means you either have to bridge it with your phone (more on that in a moment) or just go online though the broswer and access it that way.\n\nHowever there are definitely some other cool features that make me love the PB even more:\n1.  As previously mentioned, you can Bridge the PB with your Blackberry phone.  This is basically a Bluetooth connection that pulls over your phones contacts, BBM, and Email Client onto the PB.  Its quick and easy.\n2.  The screen resolution is truly High Definition with movies looking FANTASTIC.\n3.  Battery life is great.  I've gone 2-3 days without needing to charge it and that's with it being used for at least a few hours a day.\n\nIt should be noted as well the supposedly there is a major OS upgrade coming in February that will be adding the email client to the device as well as adding Android support which should take care of the app issue.\n\nOverall though, having owned this and the HP Touchpad I definitely would go with the Playbook in an out of box comparison (Touchpad would win if you install the Android stuff on it, but if you're a casual user, that is probably something you're not dealing with)"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Bought the 16GB version last week, played with it for a day, and returned it 24 hours later.  I'm not an Apple fanboy as I happily use both Macs and PCs, and feel like there's a place for both.  I have an iPad 2, and understand the strengths and weaknesses of Apple products and tablets in general.  What I wanted to try in the Playbook was a smaller form factor and apps that helped improve productivity.  Here are my impressions:\n\nPros:\n\n- build quality is phenomenal.  RIM must be applauded for the device, which has tight build tolerance, high-quality materials, and a nice feel.\n- The display is likewise terrific.  Bright, clear, high contrast.\n- Initial setup was painless, and I was up and running in 10 minutes.\n- Price!  Compared to the Toshiba Thrive or Samsung Galaxy 7.0 Plus, it's hundreds of dollars cheaper.\n- The web browser is a full-fledged browser.  Unlike the iPad, I can browse the full Wall Street Journal website.  Big thumbs up for this.\n- GPS worked well.\n- Audio volume and quality is superior to the iPad.\n\nCons:\n\n- Lack of apps!  This is the main reason that I returned it.  No Kindle app?  No easy way to read my own eBooks?  Yes, one can use the Kindle reader through Amazon's website, but that's not doable if you're not in a wifi area.  What if you're on an airplane?  No mail app either?  No calendar app? Similarly, no Pandora app.  Yes, you can use the browser...however...\n- The web browser kept crashing on me.  Over and over and over.  I restarted the tablet, reset the tablet.  Didn't help.  I found it maddening.  Other apps crashed fairly regularly too (like Spotify), but not as much as the browser.\n- I'm not sure a 7 inch tablet is a good form factor for web surfing.  It's way easier on a 10 inch tablet.  Duh.  But I found it pretty hard to read the screen - got a headache after a few minutes.  This is probably the downside of having the same website views as on a full-sized computer.\n- Steve Jobs comment about needing sandpaper to narrow your fingers so they tap the screen effectively seems pretty accurate.\n- I would have really liked an SD card slot (or even micro-SD).\n\nAll in all, I'm not sure if the Playbook is better or worse than the Kindle Fire (it's not quite fair to compare it to the iPad, which retails for hundreds of dollars more).  The hardware is superior on the Playbook.  But the lack of usable apps hobbles it.  Maybe the supposed February software update will render it great.  But the update isn't set in stone, and RIM has already pushed it back from summer 2011.  So it's a gamble.  The question is, does the tablet work for me in its current state?  For me, no.\n\nLast note - I don't have a Blackberry smartphone.  If I did, and was able to use Blackberry bridge to tether my Playbook and get access to my mail and calendar, many of the weaknesses would be rendered moot.  But at this point, I'd rather buy a tablet to complement my current smartphone, as opposed to buying a smartphone to complement my tablet."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I purchased this Playbook the day after Black Friday.  They were out of the 16 gig so I went for the 32 gig.  The price has gone back up since then so I guess I got it at the bottom.  The reason for the price drop was the bad publicity due to the fact that the Playbook doesn't have native email contained on other tablets although the Playbook will be brought up to date in February when upgraded software will be made available.  I purchased the playbook knowing this and assuming I could use Blackberry's unique Bridge program to get around this problem.\n\nWhen the Playbook arrived, I found out that the Bridge program wouldn't work with my unlimited data plan.  I was really pissed but then I noticed how incredibly well the Playbook displays stuff on the internet and figured that for the price, it would be justified on this alone.  I don't have a laptop.  I, therefore decided to upgrade my ATT wireless plan to a bridge/tethering plan.  I could have upgraded to an actually cheaper Bridge-only plan, but opted for the more expensive plan that also allows tethering, since I would need to use the Playbook on the road, so to speak.\n\nI've since been on the phone several times with Blackberry trying to get the Bridge working properly and it works well enough.  There appears to be an inherent problem with the playbook bridge and my particular phone, which is a blackberry Bold 9000.  If one turns off the bluetooth, with one needs for bridging, one can't turn it on again sometimes and the phone needs a hard reset to make it work.  Blackberry assured me that they are aware of the problem and are looking into it.\n\nI must say, when it works, Bridge is wonderful.  Tethering works although sometimes it is slow.  However, the view is superb, and because it has Flash, you see the web page like it looks on a computer--much more detailed than on my Bold.\n\nIn wifi mode, the Playbook is lightning fast.  You can save different web pages so you can go back to them quickly.  The Bold cannot be hard wired to the modem so you will still have dangerous RF waves cursing through your body.  Also, one can multitask on this unit, which I understand is unique among tablets.\n\nI have noticed that no mapping programs I have tried will indicate your location along a route, although one of the blackberry techs said this will be solved in February, when the new software will be made available.  This is important to me.  It is probably accurate, since the blackberry does have a GPS circuit built in.  As well, the unit has an accelerometer circuit so that the image is facing up when one rotates the unit.\n\nBlackberry assures me that the playbook will be able to utilize Android apps when the new software comes out in February.  One program I am waiting for is the one where one can point the unit at the sky and see which constellations are out there.  This should work since the Playbook has a built in gyroscope circuit.\n\nTyping on the virtual keyboard is very easy and for me, with my big clumsy fingers, this is great.\n\nThe unit is compact, has a long charge time, and is really handy.  I haven't used the tablets from the other brands but I can't imagine that after February, when the new software brings the Playbook up to date, that any will be better than the playbook.  And this includes the Apple product, which doesn't even have Flash, which the Playbook does."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I did my research before buying this device to make sure that I could get the apps I wanted.  I went to Blackberry's App World online and searched for some basic apps in which I was able to successfully find.  HOWEVER, NOT ALL BLACKBERRY APPS ARE COMPATIBLE FOR THE PLAYBOOK.  WHAT?!?! How can that be.  I feel I was duped.  I wouldn't have bought this device if I knew it was so proprietary.  There is no Netflix app and going to Netflix and Hulu sites directly is futile because the device isn't supported from them.  I was quite disappointed.  The ability to stream video for me was huge and this device is lacking.  But, if you want to stream one of Blackberry's obscure apps for streaming independent content, its fantastic.  If you don't want a whole version of the Bible and want some catchy devotional apps, its great.\n\nI won't even get into the lag it has and that the touch screen seems to be on crack.  Apparently if you touch it too hard, it does nothing.  I probably wouldn't have to touch it emphatically if it responded the first time.  It takes several touches for my unit to respond. Then it woefully drags to the next link or site.\n\nBut, the video on it is amazing, and the speakers are also terrific.  This makes it ok to the fact that it is so heavy it's like a hand weight.\n\nI would NOT recommend this device to someone who is not already a Blackberry owner (in which I was not)."}

I was looking at the fire, and happened to come across this by accident.  At $189.00, we had to try it.  My husband has a work Blackberry with a full data plan, so we were excited to get the added ability to bridge at no extra cost.  The bridge was easy to use and install.  The other thing I wanted was to be able to use Amazon Prime to stream free videos for the kids.  Most reviews were mixed on this, but we had no problem!  There are not many apps, but we purchased this as a family gift, and there are plenty of free and cheap apps to keep the family happy (ages, 7, 4, 3).  We have an ipad, so I was a little worried that it wouldn't compare, but it is fantastic.  I love the smaller size of the Playbook and even though it is very different to maneuver, all three kids were able to figure it out. This was a great choice and a cheap alternative to the ipad.  I can't wait to try all of the functions and to see what the Blackberry is able to do.  I also heard that in a few months Blackberry is going to offer Android apps.  I'm not holding my breath, because I heard that the release date has been pushed back a few times, but this would be an added bonus!"}

I bought it for work to use as a highly mobile computing device.  It works very well in that role tho' I found it doesn't replace my laptop.  Rather it supplements it.  How do I use it?\n* Download powerpoint presentations to the Playbook and present them at conferences and meetings\n* Load marketing materials, flyers, etc. and display them.  Lots of pdf documents here\n* Take notes at meetings using the Word To Go app which I then access from my desktop.\n* Play music\n* Great for Youtube videos\n* Great camera\n* Slinging it to my blackberry phone gives me internet access anywhere my phone works.  Don't need WiFi.\n\nLove the size and feel of it.  Unobtrusive but very professional.  Like the keyboard which allows me to take notes silently in meetings (I'm a loud keyboarder).

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I received my Playbook as a Christmas present from my parents, sister, and wife. I am completely new to the world of tablet computers, but have been a BlackBerry user for the past two and a half years. So when I saw that my family gave me a Playbook, I was very excited. I must say as I have spent the better part of the day playing with this fantastic device. My family really did their research on this. Being a BlackBerry user, the Playbook pairs via Bluetooth with my phone to access some of its features that, curiously, does not come pre-installed such as the calendar and the email app. Regardless of that though, mobile web has never looked so good. Where I believe the Playbook really shines is in its browser. You don't get a mobile view of a website, you get the full site. And unlike an iPad, the browser on the Playbook supports Flash, which the majority of the internet is. What's the point of having the \"best\" supposedly if it's handicapped by a deliberate lack of something essential? But the more I handle this, the more I am realizing that it does everything a tablet computer should do, and does it well. To say that I am impressed is an understatement. Even for someone who has had limited exposure to a touchscreen keyboard, I am finding the learning curve to be very friendly. The swipe feature, like the dots (which other BlackBerry users will be used to) allows you to do just about everything you will need to do. And as the final testament to what I have done with this so far, I typed this review on my Playbook.\n\nEdit: It's only been a couple of days but I need to update this review. I live in an area where the least expensive wi-fi option is $50 and comes with a 5gb cap. So, having my phone's unlimited data plan has been great at keeping me connected to the internet and the outside world. Where the Playbook comes into this is I can connect it to my phone (Curve 9330) via Bluetooth and use my existing data plan to surf the full web without having to add tethering to my plan. While slower than wi-fi, considering that I am able to see the full web without incurring extra fees and shelling out extra money, the trade-off is worth it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I like this product so much, I decided to write my first ever product review.  I bought my Playbook on sale for $199 and have had it for about a week.  So far, it has done everything I want a tablet to do (once I figure out how to do each task). I want my tablet to be an extention of my smartphone and to take the place of my laptop in a pinch.  I travel a lot and I drag my laptop along so I can check news, email, etc, on something larger than my Blackberry phone screen. I do have to review/edit MS Office files on occaision, but it's usually minor work. I looked hard at the IPad II and the Asus Transformer and was headed down the road to buy the Asus after reading reviews of both.  But, when Radio Shack put the Playbook on sale for $199, I had to take a closer look at it and ended up buying it. So far, this is just what I was looking for.  Here's my take:\n\nPros:\n-Connectivity to my Blackberry smartphone. No 3G version needed.  The Playbook connects via Bluetooth to my phone and my computer.  I can check/send email, move files, listen to music, etc, between all three devices.  I can also connect to it through its IP address on the internet and move info.  So whether I'm in the house connected via Wi-Fi or away from the house connected via Bluetooth (to my phone), I'm always connnected.  The devices find the best way to connect and make it happen automatically. Of course, you can always connect via a USB cable.\n\n-Price: Though it lists for about $500 along with most other 16 GB tablets, Radio Shack still has it on sale for $199.  For that price, you are in the same range as the various e-readers such as the Kindle Fire (did I mention it has e-reader apps available?).  Side to side, there is no comparison in overall capability/flexibility.  I spent $150 to buy my daughter a Kindle Touch and I'm now considering spending the extra $50 to get so much more in the Playbook.\n\n-Performance/usability: This is equally as fast as the IPad and the Asus I tried out and the picture is just as vibrant.  It doesnt' have all of the propriatary software issues that Apple products have when working between Apple and PC based platforms.  It is a 7\" versus a 10\" pad.  I thought I wanted a larger pad, but after using the smaller one, I think I like it better.  I'm mostly surfing the web and doing email and I'm not likely to watch movies on it, so smaller works better because it's just the right size to hold and \"thumb type\" like you would your smartphone.  The larger pads are too big to thumb type and too small to type regularly (thus the Transformer's add on keyboard). I'm not going to type an essay on the thing anyway--just short replies and web addresses.\n\nCons:\n\n-Instructions: It doesn't come with any other than how to hook up to Wi-Fi.  You have to get on the web and search for directions.  The setup screens are about as weak as they get.  So, I spent a number of hours off and on over my Christmas vacation sorting out how to make it do all the things mentioned above.\n\n-File management: There is no file manager on the tablet.  To manage files (or even see what you have) you have to hook up to your computer and work from there or search for it via the applicable software.  So, if you have a Powerpoint file on your playbook, the only way to find it is by opening the Powerpoint viewer and searching for it. No big deal if you have your computer nearby to open the desktop manager and search, but if you are on the road, you are out of luck--unless you carry your laptop with you on the road which defeats the whole purpose.  Maybe there is a better way, but I haven't found it yet and as mentioned above, it's short on instructions.\n\nBut, in the end, I like it a lot. I'm about to hit the road again, so we'll see how it holds up.  I hope this was useful to those out there contemplating a tablet purchase."}

Fits in a purse, high quality video, web surfing like a computer, syncs with blackberry phone for internet (except ATT), looks and feels great. RIM if you want to sell a tablet, it should be compatible with skype. Only an idiot would put a tablet on the market that doesn't work with skype. This is a deal breaker for most. However it is a great gadget for those who don't use skype."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "The Playbook has a 7\" screen, large enough to see clearly, but small enough so that it stores away easily, compared to the bulky 10\" tablets. You can hardly tell the difference between a desktop browsing experience and the Playbook. All the streaming videos, games and social networking that I've come to see in a desktop is packed in this ultra portable tablet. Support for Adobe Flash 10.2 and HTML5 means you get all what the internet has to offer. I haven't seen this actually in any other tablet yet. Tablets will either have HTML5 or the Adobe Flash Player; not both. The flash performance is probably the best I've seen on a tablet. It can run a solid handful of apps simultaneously without freezing, slowing performance or going \"catatonic\". In other words, you get true multitasking and incredible reliability you can count on. The build quality seems to be very high, and the video hardware is great, as evidenced by the resolution of the sample video clip that is provided in it. It has a stunning multimedia with rich stereo sound and a crystal clear, high resolution display optimized for HD content. I enjoy movies, music, home videos and even the web in high definition on my HDTV with a standard HDMI connection. The camera doesn't have flash, but it takes phenomenal pictures and videos in 1080p. It also has Face-to-face video chat. With the built-in video chat, you can call another BlackBerry PlayBook with a simple tap; view your caller on the high resolution 7\" display, or output to an HDTV with HDMI to share the conversation with a group. You can even use other apps while you're on a call. Even though the Playbook has a limited BlackBerry App World, this is only temporary. Soon many of our favorite apps for BlackBerry smartphones and Android will soon be available for the Playbook. Even though they say the contrary, the Playbook has tons of capability once you unlock its full potential. The BlackBerry PlayBook offers uncompromised performance in an ultra portable design. I personally am very happy to have it and I would recommend this to anybody looking for a good ultra portable and reliable tablet. I am also very pleased and satisfied with this seller: Virginia's THIS AND THAT, through AMAZON. I recommend them 100%"}

Overall, I think it is probably a better investment than the Kindle Fire, but it definitely needs to be improved.\n\nMost notable,\n1. it crashed when playing the racing game that came with it.\n2. There is no way to create separate video folders to categorize your videos.  However, that is an option with pictures. Why not videos?\n3. There is no SD slot though I think the 16gb should be enough.\n4. It wouldn't play the 30mg :30 .mov file smoothly.  I had to change it to an .mp4 instead.  I need these videos to show off my portfolio.\n5. It is not Hulu compatible which kind limits some of its entertainment value.\n\nIt might be better if it was running the droid OS as I think their RIM should be tossed.  Why would anyone develop Apps for another entrant in the game when they can reach way more of the market with Apple and Droid? I don't think this will become a huge app marketplace."}

He uses it to read mainly online news and watch some youtube videos. Since then I have bought three other 16gb for my friends, my grandpa, and my sister as the price dropped significantly. They are all loving it. The problem with the flush power button makes it hard to press is true; however, it's raised on the 32gb I just ordered. Good job RIM!\nI have played with the iPad and I prefer the 7\" form factor. If you need a larger screen than 7\" then this tablet is not for you.\nI use my PlayBook to read news, watch E! News, check the weather, do my banking, chat with other friends and relatives, play games (Golf HD, freecell from Solodeck, Bejewels, Game of Life, etc.), check/update my FaceBook, take pictures, record simple videos. CrackBerry dot com just reported that Angry Birds is now available on the PlayBook now so if you are into this game, you can purchase and play all three different versions of Angry Birds.\nThe Documents To Go app that comes with the OS is very minimal. I was struggling to find a way to insert a picture or a table into my Doc-To-Go document. If you know how, please leave a comment.\nAll and all, if you are a casual user who mainly consume content (read news, watch some videos, look up information, etc.) rather than produce content then this tablet is for you, especially with the current low price."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I purchased lenovo k1 (32G android tablet) and playbook about the same time. After 2 weeks use, I decided to return k1. I would say, in terms of display quality, touch, operation smoothness and stability, playbook is far better than k1. The specs do not tell the whole story in this case.\n\nSome specific points: I especially like that playbook has native support for word, powerpoint, excel, pdf and voice note. I am also pleasantly surprised with its nice sound. The 7-inch size is a plus and minus -- it is convenient for traveling, but feel a bit awkward for long-time browsing. My gripe is that apps (e.g. navigation, reader) are really limited. I hope this situation improves in future."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "This review was written for people who might be considering the Acer Iconia A100 tablet instead of the Blackberry Playbook. Here's why I returned the A100 for the BP. . .\n\nOkay, so I am not a serious tech person and not in the habit of writing reviews. This is my first tablet.\n\nAfter doing my due diligence, I decided on purchasing the Acer Iconia A100, which I was very excited to obtain, based on the many positive reviews here and elsewhere. It seemed to me the A100 was a much better bang for one's buck than the Nook Tablet or Kindle Fire. I purchased my A100 on Dec 16th for around $260 at Best Buy.\n\nMy A100 performed well at first. I was not pleased though with the touch screen and found it terribly inconvenient to type on, often needing to retype letters and phrases numerous times.\n\nAfter two days of use, mainly web browsing, watching videos, and the Kindle Reader app, the A100 became less responsive and developed a considerable lag, until finally it started freezing/locking up and requiring me to do a hard reset, which I had to do at least 6 times in the couple of days I had it.\n\nSo, I decided to return and found that the Blackberry Playbook (BP) was on sale at Best Buy for $199, some $60 cheaper than what I paid for the A100. Not to mention, the BP is 16G while the A100 is only 8G.\n\nHands down the BP outperforms the A100 in every way. It is LIGHTNING FAST, with multiple applications running all at once, incredibly smoothly. The screen on the BP is 1080p versus the Acer's 720p. I can not get over the stunning crisp bright HD images on the BP screen. Also, the screen on the BP can be viewed askance and at an angle, whereas the A100 can not.\n\nThe touchscreen keyboard is a PLEASURE to use. It is well sized and perfectly responsive. No retyping, ever.\n\nThe current reader on the BP is the Kobo Reading App, which does the job for me, but admittedly is not nearly as good as the Kindle App on the A100. Also, I should mention there is no Netflix App for the BP, yet.\n\nOh, and the BP battery lasts a MUCH longer time than the A100. The BP battery can also be recharged via a USB to your computer.\n\nFor $60 less than the A100, the Blackberry Playbook OUTPERFORMS the A100 in EVERY WAY. The current price of $199 at Best Buy is a STEAL. This is a tablet that draws serious comparison (watch the video reviews online) to the IPAD2. All for $199!\n\nFor someone who was in the market for his first tablet, to use mainly for web browsing, some work with documents/email, an Ereader (a Kindle App should be coming soon), and for video and music (Rhapsody!) I could not be more pleased with the BP. I know people criticize the BP's lack of apps, but I haven't found it to be a problem."}

Before buying this (or anything for that matter) do your research. Google and Yahoo is full of links, which will take you to sites such as CNET, Engadget, etc... They all have a review on their sites. All the complaints about not having enough apps in the App world, not having native apps such as BBM, email, etc, and the screen size being too small is unneeded. I saw one review in which the reviewer didn't like this because of the screen size, then stated that he/she is gonna get the Samsung 7 inch tab. WTF? Do you not realize that they're both 7 INCHES???

The playbook feels very sturdy and strong (wont easily break) its OS is very fast, quick and responsive. the browser is one of the best with amazing flash integration. It can play amazon prime video streaming in HD no problem. Multitasking is great also but at time can lose your browser tabs and must be reloaded (maybe more ram is needed) The Gps doesn't always work (must restart playbook) but that is likely an OS issue which will probably be resolved in Playbook OS 2.0 The lack os Apps is frustrating but like mentioned OS 2.0 will likely include an android app player resolving the issue. The lack of integrated email app is a bit frustrating but email through the web works just as well on it as on a p.c\nAll in all a great product but can be better and will be after OS 2.0 (hopefully) for the price of 199 AMAZING little tablet and can honestly run circles around a kindel fire and a nook tablet.

This thing though, at least until someone puts android on it, is awful.  The video is ok I guess but below other tablets, by a lot, and the swiping and browser really aren't smart.  I can't figure out why the huge black border rather than more screen real estate.  I can see why this company is going under b/c this thing won't even resell on craig's list and just opening and trying out how awful it is cost me about $100.  Stay away at this point."}

( I purchased at the level $460!!)\nOne big problem is malfucntion during BlackBerry Bridge link. Upon restart of Playbook everytime, my BlackBerry 9700 does not connect to or my PlayBook does not accept Bluetooth access. After many trial & error, I found only a solution is to turn off Bluetooth at Playbook before its power off, and turn on the BTooth everytime after power on.\nWhen I missed this process, I had to reload the Bridge App. into my 9700, so that the linkage was revived.\nRIM seems to recognize this defect. I hope they get motivated to refine this great hardware along with the development of OS 2.0 or more.\nAlso awaiting for more free app. as in the App. World of BB Smartphones."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "The Playbook is unlike any other product you've tried with the brand \"BlackBerry\" on it. I also own a BlackBerry Torch 9800 smartphone which uses OS6 and the Tablet operating system on the Playbook is light years ahead of that one. In other words, if you're interested in this tablet but don't like the way BlackBerry phones operate; fear not: this thing is slick, modern, and smart.\n\nThe hardware design is extremely simple. There are only 4 buttons to be found on the entire device: volume up and down, pause/play, and power. Everything else is done via touchscreen or the surrounding bezel (also tilt sensing for some games.) There are a pair of very excellent cameras that can both shoot HD video and on the bottom are your micro HDMI and mini USB ports. The overall feel of the device in your hand is light and well-balanced, enough so that holding it in one hand for extended periods of time is tolerable.\n\nThe user interfase is terrific on this device. Gone is the cluminess of the phone operating system. Everything is done with swiping, tapping, and gesturing. It is extremely easy to learn how to navigate the system because everything you do feels basically natural. Pulling up apps and menus is simple and fun. Typing on the touch screen is fluid and very responsive. The 1ghz dual core processor definitely does its job well on this device; handling multiple applications seamlessly.\n\nThe Playbook got hammered by reviewers upon its release and for good reason, several of which exsist to the time of this writing. We still await the much touted \"Playbook 2.0\" software update that is scheduled to bring BBM, native e-mail, native calendar, and android apps, among other items, around February 2012. The limited selection of available applications is part of the reason that Playbook doesn't enjoy more market share. While it pales in comparison to competition like iPad, the appworld selection has come a very long way since the launch. I found most of what I was looking for although it was disappointing to not have netflix, kindle, or pandora apps. Hopefully those will be added soon.\n\nWith pros and cons weighed it is easy to recommend the BlackBerry Playbook at it's current Amazon prices. Rumors are that the $199, $299, and $399 prices will be coming back in late December and this device is worth every bit of that and more. Even if you despise BlackBerry smartphones, the Playbook is a different animal. Give it a try!"}

I was just comparing to the Kindle Fire. In comparison to the Fire, there is no contest. The Playbook has twice the RAM, Bluetooth, GPS, HDMI out, twice as much storage, a better app market, and two high quality cameras. After using the PB for a few days I realized it was even better than the iPad 2. It has far better cameras (5 and 3 mp vs. 1 and 0.3,) free GPS, twice the RAM, better DPI, and better multitasking. The OS on the Playbook is superb, even compared to iOS. The web browsing is far better, with tabs, flash support, and Java. Overall, the Playbook is only hurt by a mediocre app market. For 200 or even 300 dollars, the Playbook is an amazing deal."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Let me start by saying that i don't understand why people continue to bash the playbook...Its an awesome little device. This thing can handle anything thats thrown at it. The drag and drop via wifi is pretty awesome. Files, pics, videos can be easily added/removed. There isn't a proprietary format or program (iTunes) that everything needs to go through, which is a major bonus, no need to sync! Also the complaint about native email...really, do we need to check the same email 3 times...One on your pc, one on your smartphone and now you want ability to open it on the playbook. Im fine with no native email on the playbook. I use my playbook for a portable little media device where i can show pics/videos of the kids, surf the net, read a book and play a game here and there. If your looking for ability to do everything you can do on your desktop they have a device for that...its called a laptop! The whole purpose for being so small is portability or on the go, you load your items onto the playbook, you take what you need...just like packing a suitcase. Now for the apps...I have an iPhone that i have purchased 75-100  apps for...i used all of them when i first got them but now i use less than 5% of them. App world is limited with their selection but there are plenty of apps that will interest everyone. Now for the price...at $500 i would not have purchased the 16g playbook...BUT for $199 its a good deal! I could buy  2 1/2 16g playbooks for the same price as one 16g iPad..Is the iPad really that much better or do people just like saying \"i have an iPad\" to fit in with the rest of the people who overpaid for a portable device, which really isn't any smaller than a laptop!"}

When surfing the internet, the device can easily tab between multiple web pages regardless of the web browser.  One of it's best features is that the device comes preloaded with all your favorite links (best of the web), and also hotmail, google, etc.  It is also a very solid device.  It has a good weight to it, and feels like it could withstand a little unwelcome abuse. There are many deals out there right now for this tool. I paid $550 for another device for a gift, and I paid much less for the playbook.  I like both tools, each has their pros and cons, but at the end of the day they essentially perform the same functions but in a different day.

I bought a smart phone when i thought that they had progressed to the point that they were legitemit web browsers. One rule I had was no iphone or blackberry. While shopping I look at the torch. Perfect size and did everything you wanted, later I found out that you could throw it against a brick wall and the phone was unphased (try that with an iphone.). Since I have discovered RIM products I am very impressed with they're quality. I came in late, therefore I did not have this iphone first mentality. I have used a ipad and thought it was very good piece of equipment. Having the experience with blackberry over the last year I was interested in the playbook because I am a small business owner. The more efficient the more money simple as that. 599 for a base model was steep. I had played with a playbook at the local best buy and thought it was very very interesting. So, going against the reveiws, I bought a pb when I saw a 300 dollar price tag. My big regret is not getting the 64 ( got the 32).\nThe power button. What??? I don't know what else to say about that.\nApps. Any app that I need THAT IS USEFULL is there! The apps for playbook are great quality as well. I don't need to have 500000 photo apps or play scrabble with my buddies will at work. So enough with that. put out quality apps that fulfill a need not just fill up your app center.\nMy expectations have been exceeded with this devise. Once again a big part of it is the hardware. Rims equipment is stout. The playbook is best describe as smooth. It combines the convenience of a smart phone (big part of that is the 7in screen, 10in more bulky, i can put the playbook in my coat pocket) with the utility of a laptop. Wifi works great, browser works great, operating system works great. I use it for patient files, x-rays, forms, etc.... I can store and access them were ever i am with ease.

Best of it is high definition videos with nice sound quality can be ennjoyed in your hands nice and portable without discomfort of weight (comparing other touch devices) or heat(laptops).

I finally did get help from Blackberry for something so basic that all they had to do was include a set of what do you have to do first instructions in the box. I do not like that you have to have wifi access from the get-go just to get the Playbook started. That is nonsense. Since I can't use my desktop with Internet (I have a virus that is giving me blue screens), I had to use my 13\" Macbook Pro and figure out where I put the adapter for the Netgear WNR2000 that I hadn't used in a year. When I got that done, then the Playbook downloaded the software it needed. I still think it is a very cumbersome system of all the things that Blackberry wants the consumer to do before the thing can be used . . .\n\nHaving said all that, I still didn't take off a star this time because I LOVE THIS MACHINE. I wish I could give one to everyone in my family. If I'd known that Best Buy was going to sell the 32GB model for only $249, I would give this 16GB away and buy that one. I keep finding out new things about what it can do every day. I had already grown tired of my Ipod Touch 4G (which I only use for the music) that has a screen and keyboard too tiny for any meaningful web surfing. The iPad has the problem of being too big to be portable. From what I have heard that is why this Christmas season consumers are gravitating to the 7\" tablets, and I can sure see why. My favorite use of the Playbook is web surfing. I love the user interface, it just makes sense. Of course you cannot rave enough about the screen. I am now going to invest in an Otterbox Defender case. Did i mention yet how much i am in LOVE with this machine?\n\nThanks for the comments to my first review.\n\nFirst review: I really wanted to like this tablet. Its features, its screen, the ways you swipe--all very cool. But I couldn't even do any of that because I couldn't complete the set up. Couldn't do it at a public wifi (tried twice). Couldn't do it with my Mac's Airport. Tried to connect to an ad hoc network on my PC, until I learned that Blackberry set it up not to connect to an adhoc network. Blackberry has also set it up so that you can't use the Playbook until you establish a wifi connection and go thru the set up process. I tried to do this for over three weeks, I searched all over the Web for help with this problem and nothing worked. So I have never had the opportunity to experience this tablet. Even if I can eventually get thru the set up, I can't go thru having wifi issues every time I want to use the PB. So it is with much regret that I am taking it back to the store. On the other hand, a manufacturer shouldn't make it so difficult for a consumer to enjoy their product."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "After owning the iPad 1 for quite some time, I decided to buy the 16GB Playbook on pre-Xmas sale that was hard to pass up. The intended use was mostly as a web browser. Well, even though I'm not returning it, I am disappointed.\n\nThis is a tiny screen that (for me anyway) is hard to read, navigate, and use touch sensing with my fat fingers. My eyes get tired trying to read the microscopic text and gives me a headache. If you increase the font size to resolve this, then you see only a few words as the real estate gets very limited with this small display. It's also way too sensitive to gestures, and I find myself having to endlessly close advertising and other windows I never intended to open.\n\nLastly, it's not as intuitive as the iPad.  Maybe I just got used to the iPad, but I sincerely believe it's a much better tablet despite its hefty cost.  10\" in my mind is minimum that any tablet screen size should practically be, and the Playbook for this reason doesn't cut it.  Like I said, for a couple bills it's worth it as an extra tablet, but not much more than that and not as a primary tablet."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I'll make this brief: I've owned or used pretty much every significant tablet out there: iPad, Samsung Galaxy, Amazon's Fire, HP Touchpad, Motorolla's Xoom, and offerings from HTC, Lenovo and others.\n\nIn terms of build and performance, this tablet betters them all: Super responsive, fantastic vibrant high resolution screen, extremely good built in cameras (for a tablet), decent (especially within a 7\" tablet form factor) battery life, etc.\n\nIn fact, if this tablet were running Android or Apples iOS, I expect it would be a major contender.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not. It's running RIM's QNX operating system. Now, this isn't a bad OS. In fact, it's a very good one. But there aren't a whole lot of third party apps available for QNX--and it doesn't appear there ever will be, with most development efforts being applied to Android and iOS.\n\nSo you're kind of stuck with the app set that comes in the box. That's OK for some stuff (the browser is very fast and good, the YouTube app is outstanding). But other stuff is missing entirely. For example, this unit has a built in GPS. But it doesn't provide any apps to use it. Huh? The camera app that's built in is fine, but pedestrian--a shame given how good the camera is. There's no Skype app, though it has a front facing camera that should be used there. There's no Netflix support, either, to name another popular tablet app. There's also no support for the most popular book readers, like Amazon's Kindle or Barnes & Noble's Nook> That means that even though this is a WAY better hardware platform than Amazon's Fire (and, currently, at the same price), you can't actually use it for that purpose.\n\nThe good news is that RIM has been promising support for Android apps in the next major update of QNX. (The bad news is that they've been promising that update since last Summer--but there's a developer version of the new OS that some have tried that actually makes good on the promise). But there's a catch there, too: You'll have to get the apps through RIM's own Android store, not through Google's Market, and not through Amazon's AppStore. That means, presumably, you'll only have access to subset of the Android apps, and possibly at prices that won't make you smile. (Especially if you already own a bunch of paid Android apps, and aren't able to use them directly on your PlayBook).\n\nIn the end, this is a truly first class piece of hardware, but sadly not first in class with respect to software support.\n\nIf you can deal with the software limitations (and with a 7\" form factor), this is a great deal at RIM's current blowout pricing."}

In my personal experience, it blows the iPad out of the water (I have used one for a few weeks)...

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I purchased the 64GB version over Thanksgiving and have not put it down.  When one examines all the (seemingly negative) press about this tablet, it's obvious that the negatives are based in RIM's marketing efforts, rather than any particular technology shortcoming of the tablet.  Admittedly, the OS software on this tablet is still a work in progress, but is way better than what Apple released on its first iPad.  I'll also agree that it will work much better for you if you already have a BB phone, as it's software is designed to pair with your phone over Bluetooth and share your email, contacts, to-do list, Messenger, etc.  Reports that these apps are missing from the Playbook are simply false.  These applications magically reveal themselves as soon as the Playbook has a link with your BB phone (I'm using a Torch 9810.)\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the Playbook is top notch.  Its build quality, combined with the true multitasking of its QNX OS, makes it physically and technically competitive, if not outright superior, to any other tablet out there, iPad included.  Speaking of iPad, I'm not against them, as I own an iPad-2 as well.  I also own five (5) Mac computers, and most in my family have iPhones.  I'm also a professional software engineer and have been programming on Unix systems for over 25 years, and on Apple's Mac systems for the past 4 years.  So believe me, I'm not an Apple basher.  But I'd put this little guy up against an iPad any day on the technical merits and just plain old day-to-day usability.\n\nAnd that brings up my last point. The thing that really grabs my attention is that it's more portable, and therefore more useable than the iPad.  Agreed, the iPad has a bigger screen for surfing the net, but if your iPad is staying at home because it's \"just a bit to big to carry around,\" what good is it?  I'll be surfing with my 7\" Playbook while you're having to zoom in/out on the tiny screen of your smart phone just to tap a link.  The Playbook will obviously do WiFi, but it will also do Bluetooth tether surfing via your smart phone's internet plan.  I've never had a problem connecting to any open Wi-Fi system (including iPhone mobile hotspots), nor have I had any problems connecting to the Internet via my BB Torch.\n\nSo far, in the two weeks that I've had my Playbook I've worked it pretty hard and it's hasn't sputtered, coughed, or missed a lick.  I would recommend the Blurex case ([...]) and the Blackberry desktop charging stand [...]).  The good thing about the Blurex case is that you can put the Playbook on the charging stand without having to remove it.  I use an alarm clock app and place the Playbook on the charging stand at night.  That way I have a good (battery backed) alarm clock that is also fully charged and ready to go in the mornings."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Going right to the point: I picked up a 16GB playbook for $150 when it was on sale (great christmas gift for my aunt), and within 15 minutes, I figured out why it wasn't selling well at a price point of $500. I would not have paid for it, if it was at that price range. So, is it worth maybe $150-200? I would say YES.\n\nThe big picture:\nThe Playbook is very well built, feels solid and comfortable in my hands. I was surprised to find out it has a 1GB RAM. Applications are pretty fast, and I ran flash without any problems. If you are looking up Playbook on amazon, I assume you might have done your research online. If not, you can get a pretty good review at Engadget ([..]) so I am not going to go into the technical detail. One thing I do have to point out, I HATE the power button. It is so small that I can't even apply enough force on it to shut the thing down. I have a feeling that the engineers didn't bother to test it out because in their head they must be thinking:why would people want to shut it down when you have a great device in hand.\n\n@ $200 or a bit more price point:\nWhat I am going to talk about is how I envision this tablet can fit into my life  at a price point of ~$200, since most of the reviewer look at it as something that worth $400. Let's get started.  This is not an iPad or iPad2 replacement, not even close, I have one, so I did the comparison. If you are thinking about getting it to do the following, I would suggest you to look elsewhere: reply email, watching movie with 2+ people, want access to tons free/pay apps, and even use it as a Kindle (no Kindle app for Blackberry). You might say, that is 80% of what I wanted to do. Well, that's why i said it can't be an iPad replacement. What this little device can do is, it is a great web browsing device. Flash video plays smoothly on the device, and pages load pretty quickly. It is comfortable in my hand. I actually prefer holding this over holding my iPad2. If you just want a web browsing device at a good price, this is it.\n\nThe Good News:\nRIM, the maker of Playbook, has announced 2.0 version of the operating system is going to be released in Feb, 2012. This update will let you do maybe the other 80% of the stuffs you want to do. But for now, it is a very well built, web browsing device, if you can find it at a good price range. But I would not pay anything more than $300 for it."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I have always used a BlackBerry phone, but last year I recieved an IPOD 32GB Touch for Christmas.  After playing with it I fell in love.  Unfortunately, I loved my BlackBerry too, and didn't want to switch to the IPhone.  When the PlayBook came out, I couldn't have been more excited.  Not only did I expect to get the same functionality from it that I got out of my IPOD, but now I could Tether the too devices and really get productive.\n\nOkay, so as far as the Tethering (BlackBerry Bridge)function goes, I really do love the tablet.  I'm a 6'5 with large hands, and pushing small buttons has never been easy.  Needless to say, this is not a problem when using the tablet.  Additionally, the browsers is great, and the speeds are pretty good, considering everything has to boune off the phone.\n\nAs for the apps, and functionality from the business side, this thing is REALLY disapointing.  First off, the BlackBerry Desktop Software is entirely under developed.  So much so, that I think BlackBerry may have actually hurt themselves by releasing this tablet.  Secondly, the available Apps are pretty poor, and most developers are really focused on the Android and IPOD/IPAD.  Third, a HUGE number of the BlackBerry Apps are not supported on the Tablet.\n\nAs for Media and Music, it appears that only Apple can support protected media files.  If you plan on playing some music, or any major motion picture, you will need to purchase a software to crack the files before you can upload and play them on your Playbook.\n\nFinally, if you bump into trouble good luck.  I spent nearly 6 hours trying to resolve a simple problem, and finally gave up.  The frustrating part wasn't that the tech support guy was weak, it was that getting a number to call them was just about impossible.  If you buy the PlayBook, make sure you register your product during setup so that you know how to reach tech support.\n\nAll and all, I think the Playbook is worth about $200 (tethering function is seemless).  Quite frankly, I'm planning on returning mine and spending the extra money for the IPAD.  Applications are availabe that prived similar tethering capabilities, however, the functionablity is far greater."}

I was hoping to have access to at least some of the apps I was getting with Apple. This is not the case. You are locked in to only Blackberry apps which are nothing close to what Apple offers. The only similar app was Facebook. According to many websites Android apps will be coming to the device in February. This is a promise RIM has made and broken several times. I should have done more research before getting this product. The company RIM itself is not doing well because of the losses it has suffered from lowering the cost of the Playbook. I would imagine it would be a nice companion to your Blackberry phone. But if you have AT&T they don't support Blackberry Bridge access. Go with your gut and get what you want. That's my new motto. Also if you have small hands I don't recommend this device. Luckily, I was able to return my purchase of the 64gb model to Best Buy."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "OK so I've had the PB for approximately three weeks and just don't know what to use it for.  Typing an email or document?  Nope.  It is too cumbersome and the fat finger effect is too rampant.  It doesn't self correct or auto capitalize or self punctuate the end of a sentence.  It will let you know that a word is misspelled, but then what?  I've double clicked on it and it doesn't offer a substitute for the misspelled word.  Even my Iphone is more user friendly in this respect.  The PB is fast and I do like the ability to move from app to app without shutting the app down, but I could do this with my $300 laptop.  The picture display and resolution is great for watching videos or movies but once again my laptop's screen is bigger.  Gaming would be great if the app store was as big as Apple's, hopefully it will get there one day as so many of these units were sold due to the drop in pricing.  I will give it this, the speakers blow my laptop's speakers away (maybe because it is a $300 laptop)!  It excels as a ereader but once again the pickings are slim.  I'm sure it will make an excellent travel companion since it's lighter than a laptop and easier to manage and it's a great tool if you can tether it to your phone or you must be in a wifi friendly environment to connect to the web.  Speaking of which, the browser is pretty user friendly but has frozen up on me a few times.  So if you know what you need a tablet for and can get good use out of it you could not go wrong with the PB, it is fast and user friendly and has a great picture quality.  If you are just thinking about getting a tablet because everyone is getting one and already have a computer and don't travel too much, save your $.  That goes for every tablet!!!  Hope this review helps."}

When I heard about the Fire I was all set to upgrade to that product and give my old Kindle to my son in college.  Then I saw the playbook was on sale.  It really was a no brainer.  I know it lacks the apps but wow does it make up for it with everything else it offers.\n\nWithin half an hour it was ready to go.  It does not come with a manual, but all help you need is right under the help app.  The tutorials are great and very clear.\n\nNext the cameras and video.  The playbook takes fantastic pictures, front and back, as well as videos.  I streamed with no problems from amazon instant video stream.  I also have books from amazon that I can access through their cloud reader.  You have to remember to have the playbook in portrait mode, but there were all my books in a great format.  Then I just bookmarked that page and put it on my homepage.  Just click the cloud reader button and their are all my books.  I can also access my music that is on amazon.  Amazon, although I did not purchase a Fire, I will be getting amazon prime to take advantage of all that has to offer.\n\nI have an itouch for the few games I play, so the lack of apps does not bother me.  I only opened it before Christmas to make sure\n all was okay and will now wrap it and put it under the tree.  I have only scratched the surface.  Can't wait to really dig in and see  what it can do.  If RIM goes under tomorrow, which I doubt, this was worth every penny.  I believe a blackberry phone may be in  my future so that I can use the bridge feature.  Again, great product.

I didn't really care for the iPad2, its price point or its size. For me it was like an oversized iPhone, and I already have that. The Nook was not quite what I was looking for either.  So, I decided to give this a try.  I read all of the reviews about the apps,email, and calendar prior to my purchase, so I knew what to expect there.\n\nOut of the box, I was very pleased with the fact that the browser was just about as fast as on my pc.  Then I began to check out the apps.  At first I had buyers remorse, not because I use many apps, but because that is when I realized there were no commonly used apps like Netflix, Kindle, etc. I thought Oh No, I should have tried the Kindle Fire. However, now that I have read its 1 & 2 star reviews by some, I am glad that I didn't because I know that it wouldn't have been what I was looking for either.\n\nUnlike some others though, I was determined to give the playbook more time to prove itself and for me to become more accustomed to using it because I refused to believe that Apple is the only other alternative...lol... And I am glad that I did because even if RIM never fulfills their \"promises\", for me this is the best at this price point.\n\nI wanted something that I could manage the kitchen/ household with. I needed something not too big and not too small that I could hang on the wall in the kitchen. I wanted something that felt sturdy, had an accurate touchscreen, and that seemed or at the very least gave me the illusion that it would last, and that I wouldn't have to buy another one in 9 months.  For me this delivers.  I wanted to be able to bookmark recipes for cooking, easily done.  I wanted something that I could quickly look up something on the internet, again it delivers.  I wanted something that I could keep a family and my husband's business calendar on, done using google calendar, and buying an app for 0.99 that links straight to it.  I wanted to use it for grocery lists and errand list, done with an app that backs it up \"in the cloud\" and I can retrieve it from my iPhone while shopping.  Listening to music, done! Since I can watch movies from Amazon then I guess I will just have to find movies there & keep Netflix for my kids to watch on my phone! As for reading, I suppose I can use Kobo on the playbook or pull out my Kindle or Nook.\n\nAlmost all tablets out there have bad reviews, including this one.  Most just have to choose which company has the product that meets their own individual needs.  For me, I can tolerate the Playbooks & RIMs shortcomings for what you are getting at this price."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I am not a techie and don't have a business smart phone (which Blackberry supposedly have expertise in for years).  I purchased this Playbook 16 G over Black Friday at $199 which to me is a no brainer over the Kindle Fire (which I almost prebooked few months back).\n\nHere's my reasons (for now):\n\n--7 inch size, very portable and light weight, will fit even in most pants pocket.  I used to travel with my netbook that weights over 2 pounds--primarily used for internet surfing, emailing in any Wi-Fi hotspots I can find.  Even at that weight it is not easy to lug around and turn on instantly.  Now with the Playbook (PB) with a leather protective cover weighs 1.1 pound, smaller dimension than netbook and turn on from sleep mode instantly.  For others who debate screen too small and prefer Ipad bigger screen-- that is strictly a personal preference.  I just don't see it suitable for me because it is not portable enough.  And 7\" screen size is big enough for me when I've been carrying an IPOD touch for last several years which I still use and love but screen a little small for surfing.\n\n--HD camera and screen.  I've browse through other 7 inch tablets: Acer Iconia A100 which was on sale recently for $189, but the color is just not comparable.  Samsung Galaxy is beautiful but cost few hundred dollars more.  PB is just beautiful in videos and have dual speakers on the sides (not the back that can sound muffled).  With front and back camera potentially I can do Skype when PB gets upgrade, and if it never gets upgrade-- la de da, who cares at $199.  Also can you imagine discreetly trying to take picture with IPAD 2?  With PB it is easier to do.\n\n-- which brings up the comparison with Kindle Fire.  There are already tons on comparison on google and I won't repeat it.  But I think from what I have researched so far at $199, PB is a steal for me.  Fire is sold at a loss too at Amazon but it is a win win for the consumer because it seemed like a sub-$200 tablet is the price point for most consumers as attested by first the HP tablet sold out and now the PB too (and of course the Kindle Fire is selling like hotcake too).\nIt is a no brainer for me to get PB over Fire for the same price because it has dual cameras, microphone, a true multi-tasking browser, bigger RAM (1 gb vs 500mb)and storage (16 g vs 8 g).  And if in Feb PB gets upgrade and can access Android market, then it's a bonus for me.  In the meantime, not a dealbreaker.\n\n--Ease of use.  After reading a few pages into the Crackberry forum, I gleaned enough useful information for basic navigation and the more I use it the more I like it.  Learning curve is not that steep and it is a marvelous little device.  For those who have already purchased the PB and complained about hard to use, I said give it a chance and read up few tips on the forum and it is a wonderful device.\n\n-- Battery.  Great.  Charge fully with the wall charger within couple hours.  The USB-mini USB cord I found out don't really charge or charge at such slow rate I pretty much don't use it.  And battery is a much bigger capacity one over the Acer Iconia that I was considering at one time and can last pretty much whole day on frequent use.  When put on sleep mode, battery really does not drain much at all-- which brings up the loudly complained point of \"POWER BUTTON\" being way too small-- well, just don't turn off power button, put on sleep mode then you really don't have to fuss with small button.  For me, it is not a problem cause using my finger tip I can turn on or off with no problem.\n\n-- No native mail etc.  Not a problem for me since I just use my Gmail, AOL through the browser when I get to Wi-Fi spot, same as what I've been doing with my netbook.\n\n-- No Kindle app.  I already have a Kindle which measure exactly as my PB with Leather cover, the duo plus my IPOD touch make great travel companions and keep me occupied and entertained for hours on end.  And as I said before when BB do upgrade and include Android market then watch out a WHOLE NEW WORLD of potentials.  In the meantime, I am very happy with my sub-$200 device.\n\n-- Tethering.  Not a feature I am currently using but intriguing for me.  Read that a lot of user like it to tether to their phones to avoid additional monthly charge.\n\nThe only CON so far which has been resolved:  For about a week since purchase I had connection problem with PB at home.  Connection was intermittent even with the WI FI signal four bars (strongest).  Cant figure out and talked to numerous techs at Blackberry.  Talked to my ISP and even Cisco who makes my router.  The strange thing was PB worked beautifully outside of home in various Wi-FI hotspots (Starbucks, McDOnalds, Whole Foods etc).  I deduced it may be a ROUTER problem and the last tech at PB had me reconfigured the Cisco Valet Plus router to wireless G as compared to Wirelss N and now PB worked at home without any problem.  And multi-tasking is a joy to use.\n\nI gave 5 stars for the solidly built device with a great OS that has a understated elegant look.  Four stars for now for a somewhat limited app market but lots of potential."}

They're not only far behind the cutting edge of technology, but have also shown for a long time now that they are unable to innovate. The Playbook doesn't offer anything new or different, nor does it have any advantages over its peer competitors. Watch as the next wave of iPad3/Tegra-3 processor Android tablets comes next year and RIM will continue to struggle just to stay barely in the game."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I got this thing at the cutrate pricing of $199. Within a day or two, it was clear it isn't worth the price paid because it lacks even the most basic productivity apps, such as email, calendar and contacts. Although I knew this when I got it, I rationalized that I could use the web apps for Gmail and Google calendar until the 2.0 update arrives sometime eventually whenever. But frankly, web apps with this browser don't come close to replicating the smooth operation of a native app. And then there is the third party apps that aren't. No Netflix, no Mint, no Hulu, no Square, no Kindle, no Nook, no Google books, not much of anything really. RIM pushed out a pretty but nearly functionless tablet that can't compete with Android and iOS devices. Skip it at any price and go for the better established ecosystems of Android and iOS."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Couldn't wait to power up the Playbook!  Soon enough, I hit the first roadblock- I couldn't connect to my WiFi whose SSID is hidden.  Try as I might, manual or automatic, it just wouldn't connect.  So I called Blackberry Playbook Tech Support- probably the DUMBEST bunch of ignoramuses I've ever come across.  They coolly said, \"Oh, the Playbook HAS to have the SSID broadcast; it CANNOT connect to a hidden SSID.  Even we cannot connect to a hidden SSID, you see...\".  I called a 2nd time, and it wasn't any better.  There is a checkbox in the WiFi setup labeled \"Hidden SSID\", and I ensured it was checked.  Surely, a modern-day device should be able to connect, shouldn't it?  This morning, I enabled my SSID broadcast temporarily, went through the entire setup routine that included downloading and installing the latest OS version.  After this was over, I disabled my SSID broadcast.  After a system restart on the Playbook, I went back to WiFi setup, chose the Manual option, entered my WiFi credentials, clicked \"Connect\", and waited with bated breath- a few seconds later, SUCCESS!!  So much for Blackberry Playbook \"Tech Support\"...\n\n  The device is simply AWESOME- clarity and brightness are amazing- the best I've seen so far.  Navigation is a bit of learning curve (especially for those not used to swipe/ pinch-and-zoom, like me), but quite easy, actually.  Browser is ultra-fast.  Videos are sharp, and sound is crystal-clear.\n\n  So far I'm happy with it.  Just don't bank on Blackberry Playbook tech support- they are completely unreliable.  I'll share my thoughts as I explore it further.\n\nUPDATE ON 12/11/2011:\n---------------------\n  I have come to the conclusion that the Blackberry Playbook is the most unreliable piece of junk that I've ever come across- and I'm a software professional with over 15 yrs' experience.  I had been running OS version 1.0.8.4985.  On 12/10/2011, it prompted me to upgrade to OS version 1.0.8.6067, which I did- BIG MISTAKE!!!!  Immediately after the update, the \"App World\" disappeared.  And I found that I could not load any app- if I tried to open the browser, it would start to open, but within a second close by itself.  \"App World\" reappeared after restarting, but If I clicked \"App World\", I would get a blank window; occasionally App World would show the apps.  But if I chose an app to download, it would just go on and on forever.  By chance if it did download and started to install, it would end with an \"Install Error:[0008]\".\n\n  I was on the phone with Blackberry support for over 3 hrs yesterday.  They seem to be complete morons and don't even have a clue as to what could be wrong.  I'm told that once I update to the latest OS patch, I CANNOT go back to the previous version.  I did a security wipe (set it back to factory settings) several times, to no avail.  They finally agreed to do an RMA, but had the gall to insist on a $599 hold on my credit card to send a replacement Playbook while they tried to fix the faulty one, assuring they would remove the hold when they received the faulty one.  I was fairly certain they would NOT respond in a timely manner if I sent it to them, and I would meanwhile run out of the 30-day return window at Amazon.\n\n  So I have decided to return this piece of crap.  Sending it back to Amazon tomorrow- thank you Amazon, for making the return process painless and trouble-free!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Settled on this tablet after weeks of agonizing over which tablet to get. Then i bought 11/29 - and then returned 12/1. It didn't do very well at what I hoped it would do. I will say I didn't buy this for apps, I didn't care about how many were available today. I wanted something easy to carry, would allow me to read files on a plane, could download attachments from email to read on a large screen using my existing BB phone data plan, and could hold pictures to show off to others. My Pros and cons:\nPros:\n* the bridge is a great (well, almost, see below) feature when traveling and not near WiFi - get an email with an attachment on your BB phone -say a contract- no problem, bridge to your BB and open up the attachment and easily see it. very handy.\n* bridge browser works well (verizon plan on BB phone), makes websites easier to read but sites see it as a mobile device so typically I got mobile versions of sites on my playbook - so the WSJ would come in as mobile, which was fine and made it easier to read, and I didn't have to pay extra for the connection.\n* the operating system is fine but I'm not a techy and really don't get real excited about this. seems fine but generally...whatever, it works ok and is relatively easy to understand.\n* feels great, it's light and portable.\n* can hook it up to my computer to easily transfer files without 3rd party software or forwarding emails to myself.\n\nCons:\n* personal belief is 7\" screen is too small, while surfing I felt I was adjusting screen size too often. not a huge deal in the end but would prefer another inch or two. when on the WSJ site connected via WiFi articles were a little small.\n* I had trouble consistently downloading or even transferring files. I tried lots of Adobe PDF files and about 30% of the time the file would not open properly, e.g. the screen was blank even though the file was open in Adobe. Tried resetting and other solutions but never could get some files to open, but they opened easily/correctly on other devices.\n* I use Citrix to access corporate server including email and MS Office - it's basically useless on this device. Everything is way too small so all of the little icons were too hard to touch. I had hoped I could use Citrix to do business work when I needed software like Excel but the small screen size just makes it extremely difficult. It also did not fuction well, e.g. reminders from Outlook would pop up but I couldn't get them to close. I wasn't expecting great but I didn't even get good performance.\n* It seemed to struggle with large picture files. I loaded large photos onto the device but when I opened them using the \"photos\" icon they never fully loaded, always remained pixelated and blurred. If I opened in \"downloads\" they would come in very nice, but would take 15 to 20 seconds per picture to load.\n* When connected to my BB phone thru the bridge the size of the files I could download and open seemed limited. Not to mention they would take forever to download. So 1 MB files took several minutes. And a few 4 MB files wouldn't even download. Meaning when I got big files while on the road I could not open the files on the device, rendering it useless.\n* I didn't think it booted up very fast, slower than I would have expected when staring from \"off\" and not \"standby\".\n* wish it had an SD slot to make it even easier to transfer files\n\nOverall, I think it has tons of promise but it needs to be bigger, faster and a little more reliable. Maybe the next update of the software will fix that but I'm not a tech guy, I don't need to have \"cool\". I need a device that works now and with so many other choices, no need for me to wait and hope. And while the bridge is a really neat feature, it was not enough to keep me (plus it has some drawbacks). For business users I don't think it lives up (yet)."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I need to take issue with anyone who purchased a Playbook and has complained about the apps. Yes, as of today it doesn't have as many as the other platforms but when QNX is updated in Feb 2012 to version 2.0 (as announced by Blackberry) it will run android apps giving it a library greater than Android. It's important to remember that Blackberry has already launched in beta Ver 2.0 where developers today are porting 100's if not 1,000's of apps so it's only a matter of time.\n\nHaving said that, the apps which I have downloaded are PC style games which are far superior than anything my wife has on her i-pad. Along with this Blackberry has on the Playbook, excel, word, etc. making it a great work tool. I also took a HD video of my kids with the Playbook and uploaded it to Facebook, something which can't be done with the Kindle or the i-pad.\n\nIf you purchase this product feel comfortable the apps will come. If you need Kindle today and can't wait until Feb 2012 then purchase the Kindle reader, but you will be sorely disappointed with it's functionality vs the Playbook.\n\nEnjoy."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I've been wanting a tablet for awhile now, so when the price dropped on this, I instantly bought one.  All the haters on this tablet saying that RIM is going out of business or the OS is obsolete almost deterred me.  But in the end, I just wanted a tablet to surf the web on, take some impromptu pictures and videos and play some games.  I also have a Blackberry (BB) phone so bridging the two was an added benefit for this tablet, but it wasn't essential to my purchasing decision.  I've never owned an iPad or Touchpad so I don't know what I'm missing out on in terms of apps, but to me, there are sufficient apps from BB for what I need.  Navigating on this tablet is a breeze as is multi-tasking between different apps. I can have a web browser open and next to it my camera and next to that a game.  It's actually very cool to minimize an app and still see it working while in a small pane. The product looks very well made and durable and battery life is adequate.  Again I don't have it on hours on end so I'm not sure how many hours you'll get from a full charge.  The one disappointment I have is that there is no flash for the camera. That's right, you can basically take pictures or videos during the day or with bright lighting only. For the price, I can live with it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I purchased the Blackberry Playbook over Black Friday (2011) weekend after recently returning Amazon's Kindle Fire.  I wanted a device more portable then my iPad that would provide both entertainment and functionality.  After watching/reading several reviews on the Blackberry Playbook, I was super stoked to receive mine!\n\nUnfortunately, that enthusiasm didn't last very long.  I quickly discovered how, um, blah the device was.  RIM did an amazing job with the QNX operating system; it's super faster, beautiful, and an absolute pleasure to use.  With that being said, the lack of app. support in the Blackberry community has left this device struggling to find its place among smart phones and the iPad.\n\nWithout apps., you basically have a device with a camera that can play movies.  Sure, there's the internet and such.  But it's a WiFi only device (unless you have a Blackberry smartphone to bridge).  If you find yourself out of range of a hotspot, there's nothing left to do except watch movies/listen to music.\n\nI suppose you could read a book.  But wait!  There's no Kindle app.  Instead, you have a Kodo application in which you're expected to repurchase your library.\n\nSigh.  I'm really disappointed with this device.  It has such great potential if the community would get behind it and support it.  To be honest, I don't see that happening.  With Apple's IOS dominating the majority of the tablet world and Google's Android sucking up what's left over, I don't see much room for a new \"competitor\".\n\nSo to break it down, here's my Pros & Cons list.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful Design\n-Portable\n-Great camera (can record in 1080HD)\n-Beautiful and fast operating system\n\nCons:\n-Lack of app. selection\n-No Netflix app. and the Playbook's browser isn't supported by their online streaming service\n-No Skype\n-No Zinio\n-No \"good\" eBook reader\n-No native email or calendar app. on the device (they include web shortcuts to Gmail, Hotmail, etc.)\n\nAs you can see, the majority of the cons are due to a lack of app. support from developers.  Until there's more support for this device, you're stuck with a 7\" internet browsing/movie watching device.  And if that's what you want, just get an iPad; bigger screen, more enjoyable experience.  And as I said earlier, if you're out of range of a WiFi hotspot, you're pretty much SOL.\n\nOverall, I rate the device's design, operating system, and smoothness a 5/5.  But with its lack of apps., the functionality and capability of this device is a 2/5.  :("}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I bought a Blackberry Playbook 32GB because, like everyone, I was excited about the price drop. However, already being a fan and already wanting a Playbook, I was probably more psyched than people who have never owned a Blackberry (or had never heard of the Playbook).\nFirst of all, the size is extremely appealing to me. I think they have that absolutely right. I feel like the bigger tablets are basically keyboard-less netbooks. I already own a netbook, I wanted something even more portable that had a touch screen, but with faster web surfing. I also was looking for a great operating system. I really love the Blackberry OS the best. If you have never used one before, they are the most logically sound OS's and you will be hard pressed to find a better system.\nThe touchscreen works so well with a fast, accurate response. I mainly use this for surfing from my couch or wherever I want. I don't have to open a laptop, netbook, or go to a desktop. I don't need a table or a flat surface to be comfortable. The small size enables me to keep the tablet right next to me on an end-table and it's ready to go whenever I feel like picking it up. It's convenient and handy like a smartphone, but with a larger screen surface and smoother, seamless operation. Very user friendly item. I wanted to buy one of these when they were much higher in price (I think they were about $599 before?) so I am extremely pleased to own one of these beauties. If you haven't bought one yet because there are \"so many Apple fans\", let me tell you, you are missing out if you jump on that bandwagon. I used to only use exclusively Apple products and for reasons too lengthy to go into here, I will never buy anything from Apple again. Let me say for the price you pay for their items, they do not stand behind them, and they are basically just like fashions. Trendy but useless. Blackberry is a solid operating system and it's beautiful. So it has beauty and brains! The total package : )"}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "First, this 1 star rating is NOT ONLY for playbook, but on overally blackberry products..\n\nI grabbed a playbook 16G at $199, thought it was a great steal, I was wrong! As a playbook owner of just 2 and half days, I have to say, the nightmare started from first minute!\n\nI know it is a 7-inch tablet, I know it is smaller than an Ipad or touchpad, but I didn't realize it is such small until i took it out of the box.. For an e-reader, possibly OK, but for surfing on the web or watching video, I have to say, 'too small'! If someone put a playbook and a Ipad side by side on a picture to show the size difference, I probably wouldn't buy it at the first beginning..\n\nThe next thing surprised me, is a huge bright dead pixal right in the middle of the screen at the first minute of power-on. Well, i owe an ipad, 2 iphones, a corporate blackberry 9800 (the main reason i buy this playbook for), 3 laptops and 2 desktops with its matching LCD monitors. The last time I got a LCD device with dead pixal was probaby 5 years ago. Come on blackberry, where is your QA control before things out of factory?? The interesting thing is, after about 30 minutes uses, the dead pixal is not that obvious, although still noticable while flipping screens..\n\nI am not a very picky person, I decided to let the dead pixal be and continue my setup, nightmare continues..\n\nThe main reason I buy this playbook is to use its bridge function for my blackberry 9800 Torch, and I quickly realize I need to install bridge app on my 9800 torch first.\n\nThe bridge app wouldn't install because my phone software version was too old, i had to upgrade. The funny thing is, I couldn't upgrade from the older version to the top version in 1 run, but instead of several upgrades took place 1 by 1, and blackberry restarted again and again, what a joke. And after 2 upgrades, my 9800 couldn't connect to the App World anymore!! OK, it was late evening, I called it a day and prepared to continue the next morning.\n\n9800 Torch Still couldn't connect to app world the next day, i then realized the corporate email, personal emails, everything all stopped, except the phone functioning. I did some google research from my computer, 'blackberry 3G data not working', and KB24285 popped up immediately on my screen.\n\n[...]\n\nWow, seems to be another known issue from blackberry, seems I need another upgrade of my 9800 Torch to a higher version number.\n\nToday, found some extra time and decide to finish this SILLY setup. Since I had no 3G data on 9800 Torch, planned to use a computer to download a blackberry desktop manager and see if I can push the higher version from a PC to my 9800 Torch. Went to blackberry's website, got v6.1.0 B38, the latest version from their website, installed, restarted machine, and 'run as administrator' from my Windows 7 Pro 32bit Dell Precision 6400 laptop, Blackberry desktop Software FREEZED on my screen (I wish I can put a screen shot of how silly this software looks like while freezed there)!! Restarted machine again, and still FREEZED! Gosh, I don't know what I can do next, I am wondering hey Blackberry, can you mess the things up even further, can you do a single thing right??\n\nBTW one more disappointed, even if I can get my 9800 Torch 3G data problem fixed I would NOT be able to use bridge browser on playbook. Confirmed from my friend that at least with AT&T, you need to pay extra for the monthly tethering fee to use the bridge browseing from 3G.. I am going to return my playbook, and I am going to keep away from any blackberry products as much as I can!!"}

The photos are then viewable on the PlayBook via the Pictures app.\n\nRe-sized PDFs of my published magazine articles go into the Documents folder; the free PlayBook Offline Viewer app makes the viewable in the PlayBook's Browser.\n\nFinally, my 360-degree panoramas go into the Documents folder and are viewable with the free Adobe Reader app. I should point out I convert my \"pano\" images to Flash SWF files using the neat Mac Pano2VR application. Of course, they are not viewable on my iPad2 -- which doesn't support Flash -- but they look great on the PlayBook's clear and bright display.\n\nI'm looking forward to loading my own videos onto the PlayBook and viewing them with Videos app. I also anticipate good things from the coming upgrade to v2.0 software and the ability to run Android apps.\n\nI was fortunate enough to get my PlayBook when Reseach in Motion made some of the 16GB tablets available for just under $200.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "First off I purchased the Playbook at Office Max during the Black Friday Sale. But before that I went through some craziness to try and buy the other Black Friday tablet deals. I'm sure you don't want to hear the whole thing but my first choice would have been the Asus Transformer, than the Toshiba Thrive, then the Playbook. The Acer Iconia A100 would have been my last choice (doesn't matter since that was sold out too). To be honest, the Amazon deal for the Toshiba Thrive (8gb) for $200 was an incredible deal but I bought my Playbook first and I'm happy with it. Here's why:\n\nI initially wanted a 10 inch tablet for the screen size, bigger is better right? However after using it around the home and even in bed, the 7 inch tablet is a much more manageable size. Imagine laying down in bed and holding a 10 inch tablet out in front of you for extended period of time. Also the 7 inch tablet is just enough screen to enjoy videos and browse the web and the Playbook is a very capable devise with an excellent screen.\n\nThe Asus Transformer is a nice device however it's called a transformer because of the keyboard dock accessory. After that point, it's no longer a pure tablet, it's a netbook. I have a netbook and not in need of another one. Plus a netbook can be too cumbersome at times to carry around with you all the time. To me a netbook isn't that convenient to use, hence the reason why I wanted a tablet.\n\nThe Toshiba Thrive is also a great devise but it's kinda big and heavy. The reason why I wanted the Thrive is because of it's full size USB ports, SD card use and a regular HDMI port. However because of it's size, it is a decent netbook replacement. Having those USB ports would allow one to plug in a keyboard, mouse, external drive, etc. I believe that's one of the selling points for a Thrive but again not what I was looking for, which is portability and ease of use.\n\nThe Acer Iconia A100 is the right size for what I'm looking for however the reviews about short battery life and build quality steered me away. The style and build quality of a Playbook far exceeds those of an 7 inch Iconia. Go ahead and go to a store and hold them in your hand, you will know what I mean. Also the screen quality is better on the Playbook vs the Iconia. Actually I think the picture quality on the Playbook is awesome, about the same as the Asus Transformer's IPS screen, maybe better.\n\nThe Playbook's OS is different from what I'm use too, either Android or Windows, however it is very intuitive and really easy to pick up. I think RIM really shines in that sense. Also the browser for the Playbook was able to load any website I threw at it. Also because of the high screen quality, all websites are easy to read even with the 7 inch screen. I am very impressed with this little tablet. I am also able to tether it with my Android phone via wireless tether. (I've been reading that the Thrive is having some difficulty with tethering)\n\nAnother great thing about Playbook's OS is the multi task ability. It handles multiple open programs easily. Also the way the OS is set up, it's easy to manage your open programs so it doesn't clutter the devise. On the android devise, I would have to go to task manager to see what programs are still operating and then kill them. On the Playbook, it goes away with a swipe of the finger, literally.\n\nEdit:\nI forgot to mentions the speakers, they work great. The speakers are front facing and are loud (for a tablet). Unlike the other tablets with speakers on the sides, you get better sound quality since they are facing the user.\n\nBUT... this is not a perfect device.\n\nThe App Store for Blackberry tablet is abysmal. Maybe because I'm use to the Android market with a plethora of apps (more than I will ever need or want to know about) but the Blackberry App market is a joke. I understand that this is a fairly new device and can only hope for the best. Hopefully RIM will officially release the Android App player so that the Playbook can run Android Apps. This has been in the works for a couple months now.\n\nNo Netflix. I prefer to stream most of my content so the hard drive space of a tablet is not that important to me but since Netflix is not available, it's a bummer. I am able to get by with Amazon Prime, which works great, and Couchtuner.com. Hopefully when the Android Player gets implemented, Netflix can be ported.\n\nNo native email and calendar. For some of you this may be a deal breaker, not really for me but it would be nice to have. Again RIM announced a native email and calendar app for the Playbook in February 2012. I can wait. For now the Playbook has pre-installed web shortcuts to your Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, etc...  This means no notifications of incoming mail.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nI would rate this devise at a 3 1/2 to 3 3/4 stars.\nThe build quality, ease of use and simplicity is awesome. Right now the tablet can browse and play videos which is what I'm looking for. However it is hard to overlook the fact that the App Store barely exists and apps I'm used to having on my Android phone is not available.\n\nI am very satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend this product. If you are looking for a netbook replacement (keyboard and all), go with a 10 inch tablet. It's hard to do actually work on a 7 inch screen, no matter how great the OS or build quality.\n\nIf RIM delivers on the Android Player, native email/calendar apps with the upcoming OS update, this tablet would be a perfect 10/10. It's just not there right now."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "The first attempt from RIM/Blackberry into the Tablet market has been Sour 'n Sweet.\nSour because of the reviews: Much of the media have pounded the Playbook for being a \"Half baked product\", which I agree considering the original OS (1.02) release.  NO native PIM, e-mail or BBM, lack of apps, buggy Bridge support (more about that later), no autocorrect feature, etc.\nSweet:  For users, I think reviews frankly miss the point.  The hardware is solid, very cutting edge, and the new OS is a delight to use.  Based on RIM/Blackberry acquisition of QNX (OS that power car media appliances, rockets, and a long list of \"etc\") it is ultra stable, a delight to multitask, browsing the internet is a breeze, even use all those flash based content \"other\" Tablet manufacturers say you really don't need (yeah right!), and now a LOT of new apps and games have been released via App World.\nNow, Blackberry Bridge.  If you have a BB smartphone, you're in for a treat.  The Playbook connects via Bluetooth to your phone and SHARES your data plan.  Yes, if you have an unlimited plan for your phone you don't need to pay another data plan for the Playbook.  Since OS update 1.0.7 (current OS) most apps can take advantage of Blackberry Bridge as well (think of Facebook, Bing maps, etc).  Also, you get all the PIM features and BBM from your phone replicated in your Playbook.  Whatever you write/send/receive on the Playbook will be in your phone as well.\nNow to really get your attention, this coming february OS 2.0 is coming for the Playbook.  This should include many new features including native email, PIM features and Android app player.  The last one lets you use Android apps seamlessly on the Playbook's OS (provided they have been repackaged for it, should be a no brainer for developers.  There are UNOFFICIAL ways to get apps to the Playbook though)  which should unleash many apps on the Playbook.\n  I don't give it 5 stars because of the current development of the OS, maybe if the 2.0 OS was around it would be 5 stars."}

I was waiting for a better selection of Android 3.0 devices to come to market before purchasing a tablet, but when I read the reviews on the Playbook I felt it would work better for me as a Blackberry Enterprise smartphone user than an Android tablet.  I was able to find one for less than $325 on Amazon and got a $100 rebate from RIM, so my net cost was $225.  A great deal for a tablet that let's you use your phone's data plan to access the internet (as long as you're not an AT&T user).  If you have a Blackberry Playbook and are on the AT&T network, please switch to another provider and let AT&T know that the tricks they're playing with Bridge Browser is simply wrong.  Any company that values their customers as little as AT&T doesn't deserve to have any; but I digress.\n\nI've used the iPad extensively and feel like the Playbook is every bit as good, only in a much more convenient size.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "At first I thought I may play with the Playbook and decide it was just a glorified toy and end up returning it.  But after using it for only a few days I was really impressed and knew it was a keeper.  I've been using it for about three weeks and overall I have been very pleased with my purchase.\n\nPROS\n-Battery life has been GREAT!  Over two full days with many hours with Wifi on all the time and B/T on sometimes and I still have a little under quarter battery left.  Wow!  I think it was rated for 8 hours of use and I definitely have logged more hours using it.  Turning of the Wifi and B/T when not needed really extends the battery life.\n-The Blackberry Bridge works much better than expected.  I get all the PIMs from my phone plus email and BBM to mirror seamlessly via B/T.  I can even access the SD card content in my Blackberry phone.  I wish it was a little faster, but it's via B/T.\n-Tethering works well.  Been able to browse w/out Wifi tethered to my Blackberry data plan at no extra monthly costs. This is an incredible advantage of this tablet.\n-The screen is absolutely gorgeously brilliant and navigation is very seamless with no lag time.  Took just a few minutes and one how-to video to figure out the gestures (very easy and yet powerful).\n-Web browsing is very fast and efficient\n-New QNX OS multi-tasking is amazingly good.  I can have multiple apps running at the same time in the background or foreground without any hiccups or lag time.  Very powerful!\n-Built in Word, Excel, PDF, etc. is a big plus, but I don't see myself typing a document on the touch screen with my shaky hands.  Maybe a b/t keyboard is in order.\n\nCONS\n-Lack of some apps that I expected would be there.  Surprisingly Amazon is missing from the arena (even though they had said they would have Kindle for Playbook at release).  Haven't found any Google Apps either (instead RIM partnered with MS for Bing).  Lots of app in the app-world but not the ones I hoped for.  Hopefully over time app developers will catch on to this new tablet.\n-It seems heavy for it's size and gets tiring to hold it for a long time.  I expected it to be much lighter (maybe I need to work out more).  It's a solid piece.  I just hope I don't drop it since I was too cheap to flip for insurance.\n-Biggest con is that an SD card reader is badly needed here.  It's a shame it wasn't include it.  Too bad they tried to copy Apple with their silly tiered memory approach.\n\nI think overall the initial negative reviews have been overly critical of this tablet.  There's definitely room for additional functionality and I can see RIM has rushed it out without some integral pieces (missing native apps like email, calendar - but bridge makes up for it connected to a Blackberry cell).  However, being RIM's first tablet on the brand new QNX OS it is very impressive overall and a solid design.  I'm hoping that the next big OS release will add lots more functionality."}

Let me first say that if you are looking for a fully capable Flash tablet, don't buy the Playbook. Go to [...] and test out the Flash capibilities of the tablet you want to buy. I should have done this but didn't because the Playbook at the local Best Buy location was not connected to their WiFi and the sales guy didn't know the password to unlock the demo mode.\n\nAnyhow, the touchscreen isn't as responsive and as accurate as an iPad. When browsing the internet, it took multiple touches and sometimes a few forceful touches before a link would be accepted. There were times when the wrong link kept getting \"fired\" even though I would enlarge the screen and made sure I touch the link I wanted. The app selection is very limited. There isn't an ESPN app. There isn't a Bank of America app nor a Chase app. I tried to download a few free games for my 18-month old and there weren't any. The Playbook ran surprising slow even though it is a dual-core 1GB processor. I did download a bunch of games and none of them appeared in the games \"section\".

The BlackBerry Bridge functionality is slick but very slow at times, taking seconds just to display an email or BBM message, randomly, and also quite buggy, frequently requiring me to close the particular app (Messages or BBM, for example) and restart it to get it to work correctly.  This was using the latest available BlackBerry Tablet OS at the time of this review, mind you.  The app offerings in App World are just abysmal -- I could find ZERO VNC clients that supported BOTH multiple monitors and right-click of the mouse (!) functionality.  There are no SSH clients, no serious Telnet clients, no SFTP clients -- need I go on?  This is definitely NOT a professional grade tablet.  In defense of the developers, RIM has crippled this tablet by not offering easy access to the Native SDK, which is really necessary to do REAL development of REAL apps for this platform.  At the time of this review, the Native SDK was by application only, and ONLY for game development -- a very odd requirement given the marketing of the tagline, \"amateur hour is over.\""}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Preface:  I have been a Blackberry user since 2004. Last December I purchased an Android phone, HTC G2 and lived with it for 3 1/2 months.  My phone is used as a communication device, talk, text & e-mail.  The Android was primarily a tiny screened tablet with apps and - a phone secondarily.  Oh, and a HORRIBLE battery life. I came to the conclusion my perfect world was a BB phone and a 7\" tablet.\n\nAfter reading some scathing reviews by some tech nerd types, I took the leap of faith and purchased the Playbook.  Some of those reviews are just plain wrong.  Yes the switch on top is a pain in the neck.  But you only use it to turn on from a cold boot (off is on the desktop). I keep my unit on standby and have no battery life problems.  The only time I'd turn it off is for some extended period of time.\n\nThe browser is quick and easy to use.  The Blackberry Bridge is great for me with business data on the company server and personal data, calendar etc. on a Blackberry.  Since it's a 7\" tablet and very portable the Blackberry Bridge (when traveling) gives me the internet at no cost. The desktop synch program works flawlessly with the Playbook and the Blackberry phone.  Apps aren't a big deal for me. Battery life is fantastic on a Blackberry and very good on the Playbook.\n\nIf RIM's OS updates are as represented, the combo of a Playbook and Blackberry phone give me the best of both worlds.\n\nI'll reserve a 5 Star rating for post update time."}

Good quality video, sound quality, surfing the web with ease and the whole nine yard.\n\nBUT, it just stopped charging and we now haave a dead Blackberry Playbook. After spending several hours talking to the tech, we still unsure what they are going to do about it. The sad thing was we have many videos and pictures that we have not downloaded to our computer.\n\nSo, that's the updated review. We bought this from Staples. Loved it when it's working, now, not so much!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReview Oct 4, 2011 - Unbelievable Value for $$$\n\nWe picked the 16GB from Staples yesterday for $299. This is a fantastic tablet just based on the couple of hours playing with it last night. It is extremely well built, great images, love the keyboard and nice size!\n\nWe previously owned a Kindle Keyboard Wifi+3G until it was stolen. We have been researching for similar size tablet for a replacement. Thought we found the Velocity Cruz that meets what we needed but Worldwide Distributors (WD)is not a good seller to deal with. WD shipped us a used 2GB Cruz tablet instead of what they advertised 4GB on Amazon, after battling trying to get our money back, they refunded us less than our purchased price. (Please read seller feedback before you deal with seller like this at Amazon).\n\nAnyway, we finally saw this $299 deal for a 16GB Blackberry Playbook and decided we are going to go for it. Basically this is what we need in a tablet..\n* Ability to read our ebooks, news, magazines\n* Ability to do browse the web and check emails\n* Decent camera (front and rear)\n* 7\" tablet\n* Wifi capability\n* Bluetooth capability\n* Good size internal memory\n* Less than $350\n* Decent speaker to play music\n* Able to sync with the Blackberry smartphone because that's what one of us has.\n\nWill update this feedback once we have mroe time playing with it. Up till this point, very happy with the quality and meets what we need."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "The Blackberry Playbook is an underrated device. It is extremely well built and portable and is approximately the size of a small notepad. The benefits of the device include the amazing Blackberry QNX or BBX operating system that will be used for all future Blackberry's. As a companion to a Blackberry smartphone you will be hard pressed to find a better product. It has all the features you need to be more productive on the go and since the browser is so similar to a desktop browser you can watch all the flash videos and listen to music on the web that an iPad cannot. Now many who are looking to buy the Playbook will obviously want to compare it to the new Kindle Fire which was obviously a design taken from the Playbook, but the decision to purchase a Playbook will depend on what you want to use it for. As a media hub the Kindle Fire will ultimately be a better choice, but for someone who wants to be productive on the go and still have the Media capabilities and excellent QNX OS (which is a very stable platform) they will want to check out the Playbook. Contrary to popular belief and the media machine which lives and dies on Apple and Android there are other great alternatives out there and the Playbook is one of them. They are releasing version 2.0 of the QNX software in October and once it arrives all the features that were missing from the Playbook will be included. A re-launch of the product is imminent. This coupled with the fact that the Playbook is $200 dollars or more cheaper than it was will definitely bring about more adoption of the new Blackberry platform. Those that say Blackberry is dead obviously haven't used any of their new products. The Playbook is a new platform and has lots of potential and is a great mobile device for those who want something other than a media device to carry with them. I highly recommend the Playbook and look forward to the updates that are coming soon!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I am an admitted Apple fanboy. I have 3 Macs, 2 iPod Nanos, 2 iTouches, and 1 iPad (1st gen).\n\nI purchased an iPad right out of the gate, but after the novelty wore off I wound up giving it to my wife. Why? I found the iPad to be a very capable device - not a single complaint - but it was just too big to cart around (might as well bring your laptop) and I always felt awkward pulling it out in public.\n\nI ended up carrying my iTouch around more often and leaving the iPad at home. I mean, imagine walking around the mall with your wife and sitting in the \"man area\" while she shops endlessly for another pair of shoes and pulling out the iPad you've been lugging around the whole time. I prefer to be a bit more discreet.\n\nI absolutely love the iTouch, but it is just too small. I really want something in between.\n\nEnter the Blackberry Playbook. . .\n\nWhat drove me to look at the Playbook was actually the announcement about the Amazon Fire (I also own a 2nd gen Kindle). There were several references to the fact that the Fire looks to be a repackaged Playbook. I looked into it and indeed they appear to have been cut from the same mold. So my mind began to turn. . .\n\nWhat if instead of thinking of the Playbook as a rival to the iPad I viewed it as a 3rd or 4th generation Amazon Fire? Wow. That put the unit in a whole new light for me.\n\nYou know what's going to happen with the Fire, right? Amazon will release a 2nd, 3rd, 4th generation Fire, each with increasing capabilities until you basically arrive, hardware-wise, where the Playbook currently is. Maybe even still below the Playbook.\n\nAdd to the mix the fact that places like Staples and Best Buy have significantly slashed the price of the Playbook and the opportunity was hard to resist. So I bit on a 32GB unit (or basically a 4th generation Amazon Fire).\n\nRead carefully through all the reviews to understand what you can and can not do with the Playbook. There are some shortcomings and limitations, especially with regards to apps. But again, look at the device from the standpoint of an Amazon Fire and it suddenly becomes a fantastic device that will provide useful service for years to come and then some.\n\nSo far I've been surprisingly impressed with the hardware. Well-built (except for maybe the power button, but learn to turn on with finger swipe), fantastic graphics, nice audio, responsive, stable, and just the right size. It truly is an amazing device. I absolutely love the gestures they've designed to bring up menus and apps, and to move around. Brilliant!\n\nAs for the lack of apps, here's the kicker. . . when I first got my iPad I went into \"app frenzy,\" downloading lots of cool apps. But the truth is I never really used most of them on a regular basis. Also, the wave of the future is HTML5. Everything will move more and more to the web and HTML5 will bring with it all the cool animation and effects you could want right inside your browser.\n\nSo, no app for Evernote? No problem - evernote.com. Music? Rhapsody.com. Todo? Rememberthemilk.com. No Kindle app? No problem - I read all my books off Amazon Cloud on my new 4th Gen Fire. More and more robust apps will be moving to the cloud, so don't get overly-fixated on apps or lack thereof.\n\nI am already using the Playbook for most of the things in the above list and more. At this point I feel that even if RIM totally walked away from the device today I will still be able to happily use it for years to come. Or at least until Apple wakes up and comes out with a 7-inch iPad. :-)"}

My brother has the Galaxy tab 7 and his wife has the Ipad.  I love all 3 devices.  I'm very happy I ended up with the Playbook though.  All 3 of us use our tablets for primarily internet surfing, which is what I would assume most people use their tablets for.  The web browser on the Playbook outstrips the other 2 tremendously.  There's nothing wrong with the browsers on the other 2 devices, its just that the playbook browser works better and faster.  We all spent a week at the beach not too long ago and anytime one of them wanted to play with the tablet they'd pick mine up if I wasn't using it.  Was quite funny.\n\nWould recommend this device to anyone.  I didn't have a blackberry phone to pair up and still loved the thing.  I recently went from a Droid Thunderbolt to the Blackberry Bold 9930 with Verizon and I love that phone as well, but pairing the 2 up gets me free internet on the tablet using the data package I'm already paying for once on my phone with Verizon.

The set up was so simple. I connected to BlackBerry Bridge and my home Wi-Fi in just a few simple steps (I have a BlackBerry smart phone). My husband has an iPad and for me, the PlayBook beats it anyday. I love how the internet displays pages just like you would see on your computer. I took a few pictures with my device and the HD is just crisp. As for apps, it has what I need (I use mostly free apps). I love that it is small enough to fit in my purse. I'm still exploring all the features, but like I said, so far I am blown away!\n\nThe only con so far is that you have to press the power button really hard in order to get it to turn on.\n\nUPDATE: I have had my playbook for four months now. I still like it; however, I agree with the complaint of not having many apps available. I have found that App World does not work unless I am connected to my home Wi-Fi. Another problem I have had is that the playbook has frozen a couple times. For this reason, I changed my previous rating of 5 stars to 4. Overall, I would say that it is very convenient being able to tether the internet to my Blackberry phone. As for e-mail, I am able to e-mail pictures and files from my playbook using my yahoo account. I would say that it is a great tablet, just needs more apps available."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I have been using my PlayBook for about four months and have been very satisfied with the performance.  There are apps that are useful and make it easier to use this tablet in a professional setting.  The biggest seller for me is that it plays Adobe Flash and you don't have to have a special app to watch videoes on YouTube.  Being able to bridge the device to my BlackBerry smartphone is another plus.\n\nI have seen Apple fans invading the site to pan this device.  And judging from the comments I've seen, they either don't own the device or never had any intention of buying one.  I demoed the iPad and other tablets before I chose to buy the PlayBook.  The reason the PlayBook won, in my opinion, is that it isn't cluncky or bulky.  It is the perfect size if you want a portable device that you can carry anywhere.  I can put it in the pocket of my suit coat and not worry about leaving it somewhere.  And it works on most of the Wifi networks I have used it on."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "First off, I would like to say that this Tablet is everything I've ever hoped for and then some, I have absolutly NO complaints what-so-ever with this baby, and after the price drop for only $379 you cannot beat it!\n\nWith that said...\n\n  There are so many reviews on here for the Playbook (all the bad reviews seem to complain about one thing, the amount of APPS, just craziness!), there is not much to be said that has not been said already, so I'll keep this simple, basically give the reasoning behind my decission to go with the Playbook over other Tablets/laptops...\n\n  About 4 months back my \"Acer ONE\" laptop crapped out on me, and I've been saving for a new laptop ever since. It's been a hard 4 months, as I have been stuck using my Ipod Touch 1st generation to surf the net while at home, which BTW has NO Youtube or Flash on it (it had Youtube but no longer works on it anymore!)!\n\n  Well, about 3 weeks back I finally saved enough and began surfing the net for the best laptop/netbooks on the market.  When I started my search for a new laptop, the only thing I was looking for was a laptop, thats all I had on my mind.\n\n  The main things I was looking for was a fast browser, the laptop/netbook must be small (9 to 10-inch screen or so) for potability, a decent amount of memory, a nice camera, and must be powerful enough to play movies and stream content without glitching up on me.\n\n  While researching a couple weeks back, I decided to take a look at Tablets, thinking to myself that something like my Ipod but with a bigger screen would be absolutly perfect for what I was looking for!\n\n  I must have looked at every Tablet on the market before deciding on the Playbook (The Acer Iconia, Moto Xoom, Ipad 2, etc), I even went to Best Buy just to test them all out, and in the end it was a no-brainer, the Blackberry was the Tablet for me.  While there are some good Tablets at a cheaper price then the Blackberry, the main advantage the Blackberry has over them is Power, the camera/video (1080p video recording), the OS interface, browser speed, the size (portability), and more Power!  I was amazed at the OS on this tablet, it is AMAZING!!!  My favorit feature of this is to wake up the Blackberry, you simply swipe from the top edge down, and it turns on the Playbook! While there is a button to press inorder to turn off/on, you do NOT need it, a simple swipe of the screen does everything now (watch some of the Blackberry Interface video's on Youtube, you will see the beauty of the OS in it's full glory!)!\n\n  I can now record video's in full 1080p and watch them on my TV with micro HDMI connection (only $5 bucks for a micro HDMI cord here on Amazon), when I am at home I surf the web on my 46-inch Samsung HD LCD Screen through my Blackberry Playbook, I watch movies, etc, all on my TV! :) I can now take wonderful Pics where ever I am without my Samsung Camera on me, the Playbook does it all!  This Tablet is tiny, but the screen is sooo perfect in size, it is bigger then I expected!  I was thinking that the screen was gonna be just a tad bigger then my Ipod Touch screen, NO SO!  It looks more like 4 Ipod Touch screens put together, just the perfect size to read and watch movie's without having to squint.\n\n I am not a big app freak (never been), so the apps that this Playbook does have suit me just fine (Although RIM has stated they are adding apps daily, this is there first Tablet, so I do give RIM the benifit here).\n\n  My goal now is to get me a Blackberry phone with a Internet plan, this way I will be able to \"Bridge\" the phone to the Playbook \"at NO cost\" and go on the internet on my Playbook anywhere there is a Cell Phone signal, so my fiance can be driving down the highway and I can be surfing the web sitting right next to her! :  The awesome thing about this is you do not have to pay for a seperate plan for the Playbook, you simply buy the plan for your phone and Bridge the connection to your Playbook, and BINGO, internet everywhere! :D\n\n  I also bought a \"Defender Case\" for my Blackberry Playbook, this case protects like you would not believe! If you decide to get this awesome Playbook, the Defender case is the only way to go!  This case is sooo tuff, You can run over the Playbook with a car and there won't be a sctratch on it!  Look up \"Defender case for Blackberry Playbook\" here on Amazon, and check the reviews. There are also video's on Youtube which shows the strenght of this case. There is nothing better then this case to protect your investment.\n\n  With all this said, I am beyond happy with my Playbook, I could not be happier!  If you are looking for what I was, just get this baby, you can thank me later. :)\n\n:)"}

After purchasing the tablet, I held it as long as I could -- waiting for the promised Android compatibility feature.  It did not materialize.  I could have lived without Android apps, but the lack of native email and calendar applications, and the fact that RIM did not live up to the promised Android feature were deal breakers for me.

I do not own a Blackberry phone. I like the Playbook but if you need a Tablet NOW, do not buy this one. You will likely be frustrated with the lack of apps, especially email and contacts.  Shame on you RIM, this could be a real player and give Apple a little (very little) run for its money.\n\nI installed the non-supported side loaded Android player about a month ago. I could no longer wait for RIM to finally keep a promise and release it.  It works and so does Kindle for Android.  However, with their latest OS update RIM disabled the hacked Android player.  Nice.  Thanks RIM.  Actually, its not that big of a deal but come on RIM, release the dang thing already. Its Sept. 13 for God's sake!\n\nRIM has the potential for greatness but keeps fumbling the ball.  They are like the Cleveland Browns.  You want them to do well, they show potential and then let you down because of lack of execution.\n\nThe Good:\nI just got back from Aruba.  I watched 2 movies on the PB while in-flight.  The screen is awesome and the 7\" size is really nice - very mobile.  Its one of the reasons I bought it.  I kept up with email via Google mail linked to my corporate mail (because remember RIM does NOT have a dedicated email app).  BTW, the missing email app was promised by Jim Balsillie, president of RIM, in April - said it was coming in no more than 60 days.  Came from the friggin president of the company! The guy has no problem lying.\n\nBack to the device.  I also used it in the hotel room as a media player and the sound is actually decent. Web surfing is nice and virtually as fast as my new laptop PC.  Again, no issues there.\n\nApps are getting better but no where near what Apple offers. This is not a big deal to me. I don't use it to play games.\n\nThe Playbook OS is truely a game changer (sorry Apple, it blows away your warmed over iPod Touch OS).  Its solid, fast and a pleasure to work with. No crashes...ever.  It will undoubtedly get much better over time.\n\nAll in all, I did not miss my PC but then again this was a pleasure trip and not a business trip.\n\nHowever, because the Playbook is such a mixed bag and if I had to do it all over again since its now Sept. 2011, I would wait to see what the Amazon tablet looks like.  It should be coming out by the end of October and is stated to run Android.\n\nRIM's lack of execution is disturbing, as well as its deceitful marketing.  However, I have to say I do like the device and I really like the size, the beautiful screen and its solid build. The Playbook is not a cheap piece of plastic. Its really built well.  I considered the iPad2 and used it several times at the Apple store.  It just looks and feels like a big iPod Touch and at 10 inches, well...why not just carry your laptop."}

This is such a well made device and it has so many useful features. Of course it is not an iPad and it doesn't have as many apps either. This causes too many people to call it a failure. This tablet could fail but it certainly has potential. For anyone wondering, the apps are getting better and coming out more frequently. The new OS, 2.0, is due soon along with native email and calendar etc. The Android player is due soon, which is nice but I believe there will be more than enough native apps to make the Playbook worthwhile to more people. For me this is the best tablet, and I am a big Apple fan. Me and my wife own an iPod touch. I had the first iPhone and I own a iMac which is a great machine. There is a lot said here in the reviews about the Playbook, but if your on the fence consider getting one now. The tablet is selling well even today. There are more and more companies who make apps for Android / Apple who are making their apps for Playbook. No, Rovio hasn't made Angry Birds yet, but Electronic Arts has already made 3 popular titles available. The new OS update will give the tablet many features people have wanted since it's release and the price is coming down. I would say try the Playbook in Best Buy or wherever but that still is not the best way to judge it. You really need to have it for a week and use it. I give it 5 stars."}

The Playbook has excellent build quality.  The negative points about the powerbutton are absolutely ridiculous--it works perfectly.  The keyboard is small but works well, and the shift to symbol screen that others have complained about is also ridiculous--it works fine, and gets faster the more you use it.  The screen is phenomenal and far outshines ipad or any other tablet.  The bridge to phone works perfectly, and I can get access to my secure outlook emails or hotmail emails flawlessly, anywhere I have cell phone coverage.  I am not big on apps, so that has not been a problem for me, but the documents to go and native adobe app are great features.  I was worried about lack of native dropbox, but I can easily access my dropbox or sugar sync online through the excellent browser to get access to ANY of my files or photos from ANY of my computers. I LOVE the size. If I want 10 inches, I'll fire up my laptop--if you want to lug around a big tablet, go buy a big tablet. The portability of this thing, along with build quality and features is what sold me, and I am glad I bought it.  I have not done much with the cameras yet, but they are excellent in daylight, less so in dark lighting--video quality is outstanding, as is viewing any video.  Speakers are excellent compared to other tablets. Bottom line--this tablet is exactly what I was hoping for and I love it's features and build quality.  This should be the tablet of choice for anyone with a blackberry.  Why on earth would I buy another tablet, when this one has the best of what I want and links to my phone for internet access from anywhere?  Why would I want a native e-mail app when I can access all my existing accounts on Playbook through it's excellent browser or my phone?  This tablet is a no-brainer for blackberry users.  It may not be for everyone, but it's a five star for me."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I currently use a BB for work and home, so lacking native email, contacts and cal was not an issue. I could see it as a big issue for a non BB user. When they finally get released, I think you have a perfect tablet. The lack of apps is an issue, but hopefully is the \"promised\" Android Player get's realized.\n\nHowever, the other great elements outweight the lack of apps and native basic programs. It's really the only tablet that brings the \"FULL\" web. I don't need to have to get apps to browse some sights like another tablet. The Bridge function is great. Sure the Browse could be faster, but there isn't a teether fee, so what's there is trade off. You can record in HD 1080. You get Documents to go for free. You can update out of the box. And you can actually multi task and not miss a step.  I like the 7\" size. If I wanted 10\", I would get a Mac Air. I actually use the Playbook more ofen than my iMac."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Full Disclosure: I received a complementary 16GB Playbook tablet from RIM for a test drive and was asked to give an honest review of it. I have been using it for about three months.\n\nThe short: The Playbook is a capable device for what you need it for: Reading and consuming content. It has great form factor (7\" screen) and a fun interface complete with secret gestures to switch between apps or to reveal menus. Unfortunately the device itself is only half the utility of owning a tablet: You need access to apps and content to make that experience useful and interesting. The Blackberry App World store has a long way to go (as of September 2011) to be adequately populated with useful apps. But if everything you want to read is online, then you'll be fine with the Playbook.\n\nWhat I liked about the device: I liked that the Playbook was compact in size (smaller than the iPad) and was ideal for reading webpages. You don't really need it to be any larger. The shape and weight feel nice in your hands -- it feels high quality. You'll probably hear about the gestures like side-swiping the bottom of the screen to switch apps, diagonal swiping from the top left to access settings, and side-swiping to switch tabs. I think Blackberry did a great job at creatively organizing their interface. It's fun to use because of that, but it can also be frustrating if you don't have the gestures down.\n\nI've heard that the integration with a Blackberry mobile device is pretty hot, but unfortunately, I don't use a Blackberry for mobile so I didn't get to experience the instantly synched emails and other features I saw in a demo.\n\nWhat else worked:\n-Battery life was ok (about 7-10 hours of use on a charge, full brightness)\n-Camera on front and back sides\n\nWhat needs improvement:\n- More apps in the App World. A search for what I think are some very broad categories of apps you might want on a tablet were found lacking (note-taking apps, video messaging). I mostly relied on web apps such as Gmail, Twitter, and Google Reader.\n- Type ahead. I never realized how much I rely on auto-correct on my iPhone until I experienced the frustration of my own inaccurate typing on the Playbook. It was frustrating to not be able to type emails of great length because the process was too slow trying to correct my mistakes. This basically makes the Playbook a device suited for consuming content rather than creating it.\n- Sometimes the touch screen is not as responsive as I'd like. With clean fingers and a clean screen, I might get 1 length unit of page scroll for every 1.5 length units my finger swiped.\n\nIf the pricepoint is right for you and you are primarily interested in reading stuff online, then the Playbook may be right for you."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "About me: I have a BB Tour on Verizon.  I was looking for a tablet that allowed for productivity, but also had uses for when I had free time around the house or when traveling.  I will try to edit this review as software updates come out or as new apps are introduced.\n\nPro's:\n1. Screen.  The resolution is brilliant.  I've been watching music videos (via the built-in Vevo app and youtube) and movies (via Amazon prime) on it and am constantly impressed with the clarity.  Someone asked me if the screen was too small for movies to which I replied, \"No, but if it were I'd just watch it on my 73\" plasma.\"\n\n2. Internet.  This is one of the selling points for RIM: the internet as it was made to be seen.  Every web site comes up exactly as it would on your desktop.  I like it.\n\n3. Interface.  Another user pointed out that the interface wasn't as user friendly as it could be.  Perhaps.  I just fiddled around with it for about 20 minutes and I was set.  The interface is smooth, responsive, and a pleasure to work with.  Also, the OS is FAST.  I regularly have 4-5 applications open at once (usually youtube playing in the background while editing a document +/- various webpages open that I frequent often i.e. cnn, amazon, cnet).\n\n4. Size.  This tablet is just the right size.  You can view documents, the internet, and read books on it easily.  Editing documents gets a little tight on landscape with the keyboard, but it's manageable.  As others have mentioned, it has a very sturdy feel to it.  It's built to last.\n\n5. Camera.  Outstanding resolution on the camera.  If you know someone else with a playbook, the video chat quality is superb.  When I video with others who have an iPad I use the ReelPortal app and that works great.  Would be great if you could use the native BB video program with non-playbook users.\n\n6. BB Bridge.  Huge advantage being able to connect to the internet when there is no wi-fi service available.  As Borat would undoubtedly say, \"Very nice.\"\n\nCon's:\n1. Apps.  In terms of productivity, this tablet is set.  You have document, excel, and ppt editing ability with adobe there to view your pdf's.  Where this tablet falls short is the entertainment aspect.  Where is the Netflix, Kindle, Hulu apps?  Yes, this tablet is built for productivity, but all work and no play makes Jack an iPad buyer.  I'm sure these apps are on the way, but for now it's frustrating without those \"essential\" additions.\n\n2. Power button.  Yes, it is difficult to reach.  99% of the time I put the tablet in standby mode, so all you have to do is swipe the screen and it turns on.  If you do turn it off, don't say I didn't warn you.  But really, not a real reason not to love this tablet.\n\n3. No native calendar, contacts, or email.  Nothing I cared about too much given the bridge feature.  However, if you don't have a BB, something you'd want to seriously consider.  I'm willing to bet in the next software update they'll add those features.\n\nSummary: For those who have a BB and would like a tablet for productivity more so than entertainment (at least for the moment), this tablet is the one.  It's fast, beautiful, and fun.  I love it!"}

I wanted something about the size of my Kindle and the Playbook is the same size which is just a perfect size. Anything bigger is too big. The only thing I don't like is that I can't retrieve my email unless I have a Blackberry Phone which I don't have. It's not a real problem for me because I'm home all the time and I just get on my computer to retrieve my emails, but if I go somewhere, it would be nice to be able to get my emails while I'm away. It would also be nice if I could sort my bookmarks into an order so I don't have to scroll way down to get to the ones I look at everyday. Maybe there is a way to do this, but I haven't figured it out yet. Every time you add a bookmark it is on top, not the bottom of the bookmark list. Other than these two cons, I am very happy with my Playbook. I also wanted to mention that I had to contact Blackberry Support when I first received my Playbook and they were great!"}

Imagine the Playbook is automatically updated to add more flexibility and functionality without buying a new unit, Apple should take a hint. Trust me, Blackberry is here to stay.\n\nMy only point of contention is the questionable customer service from Go4Computers, the sales agent in this transaction. The unit was used by someone else as was evident by someone else's Blackberry login credentials being registered on the unit. Fine, it was a great price and I was able to wipe the unit and start from scratch. When I brought it to their attention, I was made to feel like I was trying a fast one, more so the condescending attitude was not helping either. They refused to accept it was used, because they \"only sell new products\". All over, I love the product, but the customer service was poor at best. You can't go wrong with the Playbook. You can get a better company from which to buy it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Pros: Nice size, bright screen, excellent browser, blackberry bridge.\n\nCons: Lack of apps, touch screen too sensitive, so-so battery life.\n\nSeems that RIM really wasn't ready to launch the Playbook but for competitive reasons did so. Lack of apps for Playbook is apparent. Main reason for my buying the playbook was the initial low price offered by one of Amazon's 3rd party sellers. ($435.00 w/free shipping). And yes...I have a Blackberry phone. I liked the fact that the Playbook can access the web from anywhere using wi-fi or tethering to my blackberry phone via bluetooth with no additional fees from my phone company (T-Mobile). Very convenient for travel. I'm counting on RIM providing more apps in the near future. Otherwise, the tablet responds quickly and the browser is excellent. The screen is crystal clear and vibrant. Great for viewing photos. Listening to music is good enough for my tastes and the camera takes great pictures and videos. I also like the fact that I can access my Kindle library. There isn't a Playbook app yet...but I got it to work on the playbook browser. (Cmon Amazon...Why is it taking so long?) Reading books is enjoyable because of the tablet's size. The Playbook does offer Kobo for purchasing ebooks but I really prefer my Kindle library since I already have it. All and all an excellent tablet but I deducted 1 star because of the lack of apps."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Do yourself a favor and pick up multiple tablets and try browsing with them to websites that you would go with your desktop.  You will find that the Playbook really outshines the competition in an unreal way.  It has tabs for browsing, so do a couple of others.  It has flash, so do other tablets.  But, what you will notice is that the Playbook actually works well like a fine crafted tool and becomes an extension of your desktop away from your desktop.  I use gmail, and since there is no native email application for all mail, RIM provides hyperlink icons to gmail, hotmail and yahoo.  On the gmail application, it works better than the desktop PC version.  It has \"swipe to refresh\" gesture for immediately checking emails, and the Google calendar also works well.\n\nThe UI is fluid.  You have swiping gestures to move around the \"home pages\" instead of having to find and hit a special button.  You swipe applications into place or out very much like Tom Cruise in Minority report, and it feels crafty. I actually am using this more and more, more so than my desktop PC but less than my cell phone."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I did a lot of research on tablets prior to purchasing the Blackberry Playbook and the Playbook had the most intuitive interface, the best camera, the best video, the best sound (speakers are on the front instead of the back), excellent integration of Flash, and the 7\" size makes it easy to thumb type. I reviewed other tablets as well before making my decision. The Samsung Tab 10.1 has the Google Android OS, which is kind of bare bones. It has a lower quality camera and the speakers are on the back, so the sound isn't directly towards you and sounds muffled. The Android OS defaults to mobile sites and I tried to play flash videos on the web and kept getting errors that would close the browser. The iPad 2 had many good features, but the camera was low quality, the speakers were on the back as well, and it did not support Flash. Also, the user interface is kind of plain. The only drawback to the Playbook tablet is a lack of apps, but it is a new OS compared to Android and Apple, so they will come with time. It will soon, however, have the ability to play Android apps and it is like a computer in that you can do anything you want on the web. The bridge is also exceptional, if you are a Blackberry owner. You can chat with friends through Blackberry Messenger, send e-mails, pull files from your phone, jot down notes, enter tasks in a list, look at contacts, and look at or update your calendar.\n\nI wanted a tablet for reading, web surfing, e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, messaging, calendar, taking pictures, making videos, and listening to music. I also wanted to multitask, so if I am looking at an e-mail and want to check my calendar, it is just one swipe away. If I am reading something on the web and my daughter does something cute--one swipe to the camera. This tablet does everything I need and more exceptionally well, and in my opinion better than the others on the market.\n\nUPDATE\n\nPlaybook actually has more apps than I realized. I am very delighted with it."}

I do service calls all day, and am usually on the go.  So, the portability was important.  No more trying to read on my phone display, or trying to carry a laptop around. It's just the right size. The hardware is very top notch, and the display is great.  The clarity of the display makes up for the relatively small size. The apps are fine. I do have a BB phone, and the bridge feature has worked well.  There isn't a native email app, but it's easy enough to just use webmail. I often use the Playbook as a news reader. The GeeReader google reader app is good. The Blackberry News feed is a favorite. The camera and video are high quality. I've taken some nice videos of presentations at a seminar.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I purchased my PlayBook about three weeks ago. I am a BlackBerry smartphone user and after much deliberation between the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and the PlayBook, I decided on the PB. I based my decision on numerous but specifically two main points. First, the PB can be \"bridged\" to a BlackBerry smartphone. This essentially lets you tether the PB to the phone thus allowing you to use the PlayBook anywhere that there is phone service. This bridging is available as an app downloaded to the phone through BB AppWorld. The benefit of this is that its free with no tethering charges, using a BB smartphone on Verizon Wireless (not completely sure about other carriers). The bridge allows you to view, save, compose and send emails, access your calander and BlackBerry Messenger as well. The second point is that the 7\" screen size, in my opinion, is optimal in a tablet for usability and portability. My reasoning for this is that it can be pulled out in public without looking obtrusive and loud and can fit in a inside jacket pocket. I own multiple laptops and a 10\"+ screen in a tablet is in the small laptop/netbook area so why own something that large. I am very happy with my purchase, the build quality on this device is excellent and the display is awesome to say the least, its easy to type on and fast as lightning. I know that I shall enjoy this tablet for many years to come and I'm certain that with more available apps (and the ability to run Android apps as promised in the near future) that RIM has a winner here."}

Just have the overall impression that the software is not quite finished yet. After all it is version 1, when the iPad OS is at version 5 and it shows. Scrolling a webpage up or down makes the page move horizontally as well, there is no inbuilt email program only webmail through the browser. The browser does not store or have a password manager and there does not seem to be a 3rd party solution at this stage either which means you have to enter your username and password every time you visit a site that requires you to do this, very annoying.\n\nThat the browser supports FLASH is great, but when you zoom in onto a page with flash the quality of the flash becomes very low res, fuzzy and distorted, type looks awful when it is vector based and should look great. Flash look worse than images when zoomed in, this must have to do with the way flash has been implemented?\n\nYou cannot add more tabs to the home menu and overall customisation is very limited, guess that will improve with future OS updates. Seen that there is a beta to run Android apps, which would be good as there not that many apps out for the playbook, no Skype etc.\n\nI guess once the OS gets updated, to have a password manager, better scrolling and touch responses (sometimes clicks are just ignored) better sharper flash it will all be better, but by then Apple might have released a 7'' iPad with Retina display ;-)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I've never owned a smartphone and pretty much stick to just the basics on my desktop PC.  So I was a bit wary about going with a Playbook instead of the tried-and-true iPad for my first ever tablet.\n\nWell, I'm happy to report that the Blackberry Playbook is a winner.  The 7\" 16-gigabyte model meets my needs for reading PDF documents, YouTube and video playing, surfing websites, and other basic Internet functions.  The tablet is sleek and sturdy.  Navigating it is pretty easy, even for a novice like me.  The Hi-Def video is fantastic.  I love hitting a PDF or YouTube file and having the tablet automatically know that Acrobat Reader or the video player are the ones needed to execute.  All done with touching the screen, a nice change from having to 'click' all the time on my desktop or laptop.  Battery charging and life are excellent.  I bought the 16-gigabyte model and it's fine for my needs, but if you store lots of (HD) videos (I don't) you might want the 32- or 64-gigabyte models.  If you are mostly into much smaller Word or PDF documents or websurfing, this model will be fine for you.  My only quibble with the hardware would be that 2 gigabytes of RAM would be nirvana (2nd generation model?) since the OS uses up a chunk of the existing 1-gig of RAM it comes with now.\n\nThat said, there are some problems.\n\nFirst, the POWER button is ridiculously difficult to turn on unless you have long/sharp nails.  Could they make a bigger/longer power button/strip that wasn't a fraction of your finger size ?  A minor inconvenience, but a notable one.\n\nSecond, the customer service reps in the U.S. were terrible.  They were barely more knowledgeable than me.  They kept putting me on hold and talking to supervisors or going to PC's to Google the problem and see if someone on the Blackberry boards had an answer.  And my problems were not more advanced transfer or data stuff that longtime Blackberry users might experience.  I couldn't get the Playbook to show up on my PC for some data transfers, did not know I needed to download the basic Blackberry Desktop Manager before doing the transfers, and also had a problem with the WiFi.  The CSRs didn't seem very knowledgeable about the basic layout of the tablet as icons below the 3rd row were 'hidden' but they didn't know that (we both though they had disappeared).  Fortunately, I eventually got a tech-savvy CSR from of all places Singapore who sounded like he had spent more than 15 minutes playing around with one.  I got more done in 30 minutes with this guy than 5 hours with the American CSRs.  Ridiculous.\n\nThird, and this relates to my CSR problems, the Playbook needs more in-depth tutorials on how to navigate and find things.  They basically assume you are PC literate and have been using a Blackberry smartphone for years.  Well, some people interested in a tablet may only have been basic web surfers with minimal PC expertise.  Apple products are easy to use for first-timers -- my 75-year old dad switched from Windows to Apple and he's not a PC expert -- and if the Playbook wants to grab sizeable tablet market share they have to make this not only a winner for the Blackberry smartphone crowd but for the 1st-time purchasers who have never bought a smartphone or are not living on their tech devices 24/7.\n\nI'm giving the Playbook 5-stars for the device itself and the user interface, though the number of apps compared to the iPad might make more experienced tablet users give it 4-stars.  I'm also giving it 1-star for customer service, the tutorial, and lack of an intro manual (no, I didn't want a 50-100 page manual to read but then they need to have more tutorial and 'how to' stuff on the Playbook for newbies).  The only bright note is that you get 90-days of free customer service, so that gives you enough time to get up to speed on your own and find out if you need help from their Tech Support (if you do call them, try and get Singapore right away !  lol).\n\nOverall:  5-stars, with an asterisk, that being the CSRs.  RIM needs to realize some people buying their product are very non-tech savvy.  I know they have had a stumble the last few years but you can't skimp on customer service or ease of use (just ask Dell or Nokia)."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Have been using this over a month, and still lovin' it! Great screen! Beautiful graphics, terrific games (whose graphics rival, or beat, other tablets). Love having access to my BB e-mail, calendar, contacts, etc. Works perfectly with my BB Storm 2 in that regard, and even offers up internet access via tethering to my Storm 2 when away from my Wi-Fi. Best of the tablets out there, not just for Blackberry smartphone users, but for anyone who wants great graphics, screen, operating system (QNX rocks!). Love the size, the iPAD2 is just too big to haul around. I can easily type on the screen and as much as I love doing that on my Storm 2, its even easier on my Playbook. I got the 32GB version. I doubt 16GB of storage is enough to get many programs. However, I can operate many programs at the same time, WITHOUT any lag time on my Playbook. Kudos QNX! Once QNX hits the BB smartphones, those units will take off. It rivals, and in my mind, will exceed Android processing. With a 1GB dual processor with 1GB of memory, and in my case 32GB of storage, this thing rocks big time. Don't hesitate to look at one at the store. My store (Best Buy) didn't do a great job promoting it to me, but I saw the difference, and the advantages over the other tablets immediately. Try it, you usually get several days to try it. 90-days free support from Blackberry. Yes, I am a Blackberry fan. Keeps my information secure, and now they have made that \"pretty\". Keep rocking Blackberry and QNX!"}

Without any app for Skype, Pandora, or any of the other things I need, its basically like a super web browser, video, music, and pdf player.\nI would really not recommend anyone to buy this until the Android Player is released, if it had Android app it would be 5+ stars, without it I would say its like 3 stars. Since they claim its coming out and its still early I will give it 4 stars.

Yea apps aren't quite as robust as the ipad has.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Wanted to wait a month before writing a review.\n\nThe Playbook has been exactly what I have been looking for in a tablet.  The ability to bridge the device with my phone has been very useful when I visit my parents since Wifi is not available in the area.\n\nShould point out that I really do not play video games with the PlayBook so the lack of game aps doesn't bother me.  For those it does matter, there seems to be games added everyday in the App world.\n\nThe OS is really nice and stable, updates are being pushed out as they become available.  Being able to download the updates directly through Wifi is nice since, only connected the device once to the Desktop Manager to grab my iTunes that were ported over.  Really do not understand why the reviews have been so negative, 30 minutes and propel should see it's a nice smooth running tablet.\n\nOf course not everything has been smooth and easy with the device.  The swiping motion to move through the Playbook has taken a little time to learn thus some of the features with the playback I was not aware of till a week ago.  Really blame myself for that though as I did not read the documentation.  Would like to have automated word suggestion, GoodReader app, and Citrix client to make this a 5 star review.\n\nWhile the device has been exactly what I've been looking for it is not for everyone.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "As a corporate Blackberry user, I was very interested in how the Playbook would fit into my daily routine and enhance the mobile experience.  I purchased a 32MB model five weeks ago and have gone through a couple of OS updates as well as a couple of  tickets with RIM tech support to work through early bug issues.  At this point the device and OS (v1.0.6.2390) are operating very nicely and I am experiencing no technical issues at all.\n\nI generally concur with the positive reviewers of the Playbook.  This is a fine piece of hardware, and its positive virtues are well documented in earlier reviews.  The user experience from a professional point of view, however has had less attention in earlier reviews. I thought I would just take a few minutes and briefly share my experiences and opinions in that regard.\n\nPRO:\n1. The Playbook integrates flawlessly with my company BES (Express).\n2. All Outlook features, including Notes and Tasks synchronize without a hitch.\n3. The bridge connection with my Bb Curve 8530 works very well.\n4. The browser does a great job with my company's Outlook Web Access application.\n5. The MS Office-To-Go apps offer sufficient functionality to actually create usable docs, spreadsheets and presentations.\n6. The Blue Box app offers very good compatibility with my Dropbox account.\n7. With a suitably equipped projector (with HDMI), presentations are a snap\n8. The PDF reader app renders attachments nicely.\n9. The 7 in. form factor enables me to easily take the device everywhere.\n10. I am not a gamer ( I am particularly not impressed with the multitude of silly games and useless apps the mobile world has spawned), but there are several games and entertainment apps that hold my attention during travel delays and other down time. The Kobo E-reader is especially good.\n11. The browser is excellent, as others have reported.  This is important to corporate users who depend on custom web-based apps to do business.\n12. I have successfully connected a bluetooth MS Mobile Keyboard 6000 and Lenovo Bluetooth Laser Mouse. This setup works in a pinch for long duration situations when my laptop is somewhere else.\n\nCONS:\n1. Would like a fully functional GPS app.  I am willing to pay for Garmin-class automobile usability.\n2. Handling of email attachments could be improved. Currently functional but a bit clunky.\n3. Would like to see a more robust PDF app. Currently functional but could be better.\n\nSUMMARY:\nCorporate users who are currently on the Blackberry platform will be very pleased with this tablet. I have found it to be a very welcome addition to my mobile toolset. If you are interested in a Playbook, be sure to confirm compatibility with your handset before purchase."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Text editing is very difficult. The Playbook does not provide the bubble that allows you to place the cursor accurately. There is a feature that replaces that, but i could only get it to work in the Word processor. Furthermore, if you're expecting the device to correct your typing errors like in the iPad, you can forget it.\n\nThe business applications on this tablet device only work when you're phone is connect. Even then, they only present a subset of the phone's functionality. For example, adding a new entry in the calendar application does not allow you to set the status as tentative, a feature that does exist in Blackberry phones.\n\nI wish i hadn't wasted money on this garbage."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I bought the Playbook since it seemed to be a good fit for my use. I carry a BB Bold (AT&T service) for work and thought this would be my best option for productivity and as a useful 'toy' when traveling. I read the reviews and was slightly worried that it was too early to buy, but I went for it.\n\nSo far, after a week of use I am very pleased with the PB. Some of the issues mentioned in reviews here do exist but they are either minimal impact or can be worked around.\n\nPositives:\nThe size and weight are perfect for me. I added a leather case and find it the right size. It seems slightly heavier than I expected, but I think this makes it feel solid.\nThe touch screen and responsiveness of the OS is great, better than I expected from the reviews that called it sluggish. This is the first time I've used a touchscreen beyond demos at Apple, etc and I found it very easy to use.\nThe video quality is great, the demo videos and a few downloaded videos look great.\nThe collection of loaded apps and those available on the app store are pretty good for a device that just came out a few months ago. There is little I have looked for that is not available.\nBridging to my BB is wonderful. I read reviews that this was difficult to establish and that the links drop constantly and so far that is not true, expect for the initial loading which I describe below.\nThe bridge browser connects very well to my company's intranet and is already proving very useful. The BB browser was always hit or miss and extremely slow, so I rarely attempted to use it. The PB bridge browser works very well for looking up intranet websites. It also works perfectly for external websites when I am not connected to a wifi network.\nThe internet tethering is something I didn't expect. I must have missed the description of that as I was concentrating on the BB bridge connections. I had assumed that I could use my BB to access email, calendar, and the bridge browser but I thought I would be out of luck when using applications on the PB that use wifi when I was not in range of a wifi network. By tethering the PB to the internet through the BB (a separate connection setting than BB bridge) all of the applications work perfectly. This is a great feature since I have an unlimited domestic tethering feature on my corporate cell phone plan. If you don't have this feature, then it would incur additional fees, which is clearly stated when you set up the connection. I understand this may not be great for many people, but compared to a 3G version of competing tablets I think this is no worse and with the BB bridge option it is quite a bit better.\n\nSome issues:\nAs mentioned in other reviews and on the BB support forums, AT&T does not `support' the BB bridge. If you attempt to load the software via the PB's barcode it will state that and leave you `unbridged.' It is not difficult to load the bridge software from links in the BB support websites, and once I loaded it manually on my BB the application worked perfectly. I expected a bit more work to get everything to synch up, but it worked on the first try.\n\nThe app store is not as extensive as other tablets seem, but there is a plan to add android apps this summer. There are also a large number of apps that are available for the BB that are not ready for the PB yet, but I imagine that will also come in time.\n\nThere is no support for Bluetooth audio at this time. I found this out by trying to pair a BT stereo headset and failing repeatedly. I found out on the support forums that this is a \"known\" lack of support. For me, this is a minor annoyance at best since there is a headset jack and I just used that for now. If you plan to link to BT speakers or stereo headsets this might be a reason to wait. Regular BT earpieces seem to pair fine but I typically pair mine to my phone so not sure what I would use the earpiece for on the PB.\n\nOverall I am very happy with the Playbook, especially as I believe it is early in its lifecycle. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who does not have a BB, as that was one of the biggest draws for me, but if you do it is a great alternative to the other pads."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "OK.  First off, it is a tablet with a fast dual core processor and 1GB of internal memory.  So, its up to the task.  The issue really is, what's the task?\n\nI am a BlackBerry user and, truth be told, lover.  However, I didn't get here by blind loyalty.  I followed the advice of others and researched/used the products.  So, I assume that's why you are reading this, both general user on the fence and RIM loyalist alike, for perspective.\n\nThe real deal is what can this tablet do right out of the box, independent of a BB device (AKA cell phone)?  The answer is a lot but not as much as other tablets (specifically Apple or Android).  The Playbook is poised to strike but lacks the refinement of options and applications enjoyed by other tablet types.  For someone taking it out of the box and using it, they will find a smooth and effortless operating environment.  All the menus flow and the graphics fly.  No hesitation on most all switching of applications and functions.  Screen orientation is fluid and not clunky.  The Playbook gets a bad rap for lack of apps and, as i have mentioned, this is true.  To be honest though, most people are surfing the web and checking email.  The Playbook excels at these tasks with one large caveat, for email you need to use your e-mail provider web interface (mail.yahoo.com, gmail.com, aolmail.com...etc)or the mysterious \"...BlackBerry Bridge.\"  As of this posting, there is no email function native to the PlayBook nor is there an application for it.\n\nIf you don't own a Blackberry cell phone, don't plan to own one or don't ever use (or plan to use) the email function then wait for RIM to deliver the impending software update to the Playbook that will carry with it a native email application like you see on all other tablets.  If you do own a BB cell and use the email function then the BlackBerry Bridge is for you.  The BlackBerry Bridge is a native function that runs out of the box.  The bridge function is awesome and it basically extends your phone features (mail, tasks, calendar, BBM and some file management) to your Playbook.  What this really means is you admin your email and such through the Playbook via BlueTooth to your phone.  This is good and bad.  The good is you can hop on and generate emails, appts, tasks and xfer some files.  The bad is it requires a good BT connection and both items relatively close together and charged to the point they can use the BT radio.  The real solution for this is RIM should allow your Playbook, via a native app not a bridge, to use your BIS or (if company sanctioned) BES information.  Plain and simple.  They have to conquer the one PIN per account issue that currently requires you to bridge to the phone, the device that holds you PIN to the BIS or BES services.  Is the bridge function enough to entice someone to buy a BB device along with a PlayBook or enable emailing on their current BB at a price to the provider? No.  To finish the thought, they should include with native email all the PIM functions (tasks, calendar, notes...etc) that provide a fluid information chain that is accessible and completely sync'd with a BB device (or other smart phone through Google apps or something).\n\nThe web experience is excellent.  Fast and uses Flash.  Not much you cant do.  It has its tablet downsides like sometimes you get an ad or some other in window pop up that just about requires a mouse...but that issue exists on all tablets.\n\nUnless you're a news, movie or media junky, the applications (available via a native PB application called AppWorld) will most likely fail to impress you.  The news, weather and media stuff is solid.  The PB comes with the music store.  The store isn't as extensive as iTunes of course but there are other services you can use (BestBuy just announced a cloud based music service for PB, iPad and Android).  You can rent movies from Amazon and YouTube via web.  No Netflix streaming app yet for PB.  The good news on the app front is the supposed addition of Android applications that will run on the PB.  This happens via a virtual machine (meaning its not native Android processing on the PB so it can't be as fast for sure) so it remains to be seen how good it will be.  Angry Birds is coming as well.\n\nThe final deal is what do you want?  If you want a smaller tablet then this is a good one...but if you want a smaller tablet with tons of apps then either go Android or wait for the supposed Android App player that will allow PB to run them.  The real deal is this tablet surfs the web with the best of them and, lets be honest, most people want that.  They hate a hot laptop and want something lighter, cooler, easier and with less of a footprint.  Secondly they want apps that probably enhance what they can do on the web.  so if its news, media or movies, you're good.\n\nSome people have complained about the power and volume buttons.  They are a bit of a pain but you get used to using them pretty quick.  Something you shouldn't have to deal with but not a show stopper.\n\nThe PlayBook is expensive and does less than the iPad; unless you actively use your BB device.  Android bridges the gap in price and physical options but is still clunky in app switching and fluidity of operating environment.  Final word, the PlayBook is as fluid and dialed in as the iPad as far as use and operating environment but lacks the options, a gap partially bridged by use of an existing BB device enabled for email and internet use.\n\n5 stars for BB users who aren't app junkies\n3  stars for someone buying now without a BB and waiting for native email, Android Apps compatibility (and more native apps in the BlackBerry App World) and using your BlueTooth Headset (not possible as of this posting).  The PlayBook is evolving leaps and bounds with every automatically delivered software update.  But should someone pay top price for a comparatively lacking product now?\n\nthese are the things i do:\n\nSurf (native)\nWatch rented movies on Amazon/YouTube (web, native)\nRSS news (app)\nNews 360 (app)\nPodcasts (native)\nBB Bridge Email, BBMessenger(native)  -- must have BB device and email accounts configured\nSSH to servers (if you don't understand this it's OK...its for techies)  (app)\nVNC to my home machine for admin use (app)\nVideo chat via ReelPortal (app)\nWord, Excel doc editing (app)\nFile share to and from the PB on my home network (native)\nPlay \"Need for Speed\" (native) its fun :)"}

At just 0.4 inches thick, the PlayBook is exceptionally well built, and since it weighs under a pound, it's easy to hold in one hand without fatigue.\n\nThe front of the PlayBook is dominated by the crystal clear, multitouch-capable, 7-inch screen running at a resolution of 1024x600. Just above it are an ambient light sensor and 3MP front-facing camera; a respectable 5MP camera on the other side also captures passable 720p and 1080p video. On the bottom are a micro-USB port, HDMI-out and a magnetic power input similar to what you might find on a MacBook. On top are buttons for power, volume and media playback - the power button sits as the only real hardware design flaw of the device, as its recessed nature can make it difficult to push in.\n\nThe PlayBook runs an entirely new operating system called BlackBerry Tablet OS, based on software known as QNX that RIM acquired last year. This new OS is extremely fast, helped along with a dual-core 1GHz Cortex A9 CPU and a gigabyte of RAM. RIM set the PlayBook apart from many other tablets with an expansive set of gesture controls that are used for everything from waking the device to swapping between active applications.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, software is both the PlayBook's greatest strength as well as it's greatest weakness. The base system software is very fast and very capable.  RIM included what is likely the best tablet web browser available, and the PlayBook can handle everything from Flash playback to HTML5 with ease. If you're looking for a tablet to handle primarily web browsing and other web-based duties, then I can recommend the PlayBook without reservation; its small form factor makes it extremely portable and if you're a BlackBerry user, RIM's Bridge software lets you tether your phone's Internet for free.\n\nThe downside comes in the form of the PlayBook's rather barren selection of applications available in the App World software store. As a new entrant with a new OS, 3rd party developers have yet to write much in the way of good software. Combined with the fact the PlayBook doesn't have native e-mail or calendaring software, and it's enough to give any die-hard, gotta-have-the-latest-software junkies pause. RIM does promise to add an email client as well as Android software compatibility before the end of the summer, which will go a long way toward addressing these shortcomings.\n\nDespite this, the PlayBook remains a formidable contender in the tablet market. A pair of seriously outstanding stereo speakers and an excellent screen make the tablet suitable for audio and video playback as well as reading ebooks. Paired with RIM's long history with strong security measures, the result is one of the first tablets that works as well as it plays. If you can get past the anemic 3rd party software and prefer the smaller, 7-inch form factor, then RIM's PlayBook deserves a spot at the top of your tablet wishlist."}

RIM has made some interesting choices (lack of SD card slot; 7-inch, vice 10-inch, etc.), but on the whole, it works and it works marvelously.\n\nNot only does the Playbook link to the internet via 3G &/or wireless, it \"bridges\" to your Blackberry and allows you to keep your BB in your pocket and \"work\" it from the Playbook environment (by the way, Blackberry owners ARE the target audience, so once again, comparisons to the iPad and Xoom (etc.) are really \"apples & oranges\").\n\nThis is a great device and if the media can get past its love of all things iOS and the \"RIM has lost the bubble\" mantra, the Playbook has a future (especially if RIM can get a 10-inch version to market in the near term; also, I don't dispute that RIM leadership may be suffering \"Microsoft malaise,\" but that's a different discussion - with the Playbook, RIM has hit a home run).\n\nNo sense in restating what other reviewers have said, so I'll leave it here - if you are a BB user (or contemplating a BB), take a chance and don't believe the media anti-RIM feeding frenzy."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I am a BlackBerry fan for many years and did not really mind the negative reviews in the press and got me this PlayBook as soon as I could.\n. The setup is easy and the Bridge software work. The automatic mode with the QR code never worked... but the manual process i simple and works every time (with Bold 9780 and a Torch 9800).\n. Ease of use: this is the really bad part: notifications are kept even if there are no new emails. My Bold had all emails marked as read, but the Playbook continue to show 1 unread email. Tapping on the notification icon on the Playbook tells me I have no notification.... hey??\nDownloading an attachment marks the email as unread on the Playbook, why??\nSome intranet sites do not work on the Playbook when my Bold can access all my intranet sites without issue.\nWhat is the point of a tablet if I cannot do as much as my Bold 9780???\n(one of the main reason I bought it was to be able to browse my Intranet on abigger screen...)\n. anyway, I am sending it back.... it's not not working and I have too many bugs (and no solutions from Support) to be able to use it.\nI cannot recommend this product, stay away for the moment."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "What can I say. I am so glad I waited on the ipad 2. As a result I was introduced to the playbook by a friend and I fell in love with its size. After a bit of research I concluded it was just perfect for my needs.\n\nI waited a while to do this review, so I could have some time with it and like a lot of playbook owners, I am just baffled by how this device got all those bad reviews. This thing is just pure pleasure to use.\n\nI have been using a bb smart phone to keep my life organized & the addition of the playbook has made it even better. Being able to access my email accounts, calendar, tasks, files and even bbm from the playbook is sweet. My phone battery lasts for days now even with wifi & bluetooth on because I hardly pick it up.\n\nOne of the complaints was the lack of 3g, but IMO I think I have a sweet deal. I can surf the web through the bridge browser which doesn't cost me a cent more. In fact I could tether it to my phone & use the regular browser or whatever if I am desperate without having the expense of an additional data plan to manage.\n\nLack of apps was another complaint. Again, the device was brand new, so I didn't expect a lot of apps. Hell, the ipad went through the same thing. That being said, apps are coming out daily and I have been able to find quite a few useful ones. That should get better with time.\n\nBlackberry's support seems pretty good as well. Since I have had it, there has been a few updates to the OS that unbelievably makes it better every time.\n\nI'll finish by stating I have no loyalty to blackberry, but I have to call a spade a spade. This tablet is as good as advertised and I am very happy with it.\nReally happy with this purchase."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I was considering between a tablet and a new laptop, mainly for surfing the net. I seriously considered the Ipad, but decided not to buy one because of its lack of support for flash, and its metal back cover is a bit slippery to hold. So I decided to buy the playbook. The playbook appears to be solid. Its size makes it ideal for me to put it in my backpack, and not worrying about breaking it. Also it feels solid to hold, and its size makes it very easy to thumb type. By the way, I'm lying in bed right now while typing this review on my playbook. Of course the biggest thing is flash. I have to admit that when I first got it, the browser was a bit choppy. I couldn't go on a few websites (flash and non-flash). But after the latest update (last week), the browser has been awesome. I have not had experienced any difficulty with any website at all. Sometimes it's difficult to click on a link (because it's too small) and I have to zoom in to do it accurately. But the zoom function is so smooth and works so well that it doesn't bother me that much.\n\nA few extra features that I really like are tethering and HDMI. Currently Playbook only has Wifi. But I can tether it to my blackberry and still have the data on the go, without paying extra. Also, you can output the screen to your TV using the HDMI port to watch movies. It also has a dual mode where you can continue to watch movie on your TV, at the same time you can open the browser in your playbook or other app. It's really impressive. Oh, and the UI is really sleek.\n\nI read so many reviews before deciding to buy the Playbook. Most of the negatives do not apply to me. First of all, the lack of app. I'm not a big fan of useless app. The app store has a few fun games that I downloaded and play a few times. But I haven't run them for a long time. Another one is the lack of email software. I have my phone for that. Besides, you can go to Gmail or hotmail or yahoo mail websites (if you have them) and do your email there. And I heard they will release the software sometime this summer, if that's what you want."}

I do have a blackberry phone and the bridge feature is really great, especially when I am on the road for work and WIFI is not readily available. It let's me basically surf the web from anywhere there is a 3G connection on my phone.\n\n- The screen is fantastic! Full 1080p movies on this thing are incredible.\n- I basically retired my other camcorder- The playbook takes great full HD videos.\n- Camera is great too.\n- The web browser is great.. all pages load fully and is fast with my home wifi connection\n- Battery life is great.. a good 8-10 hours of use without any recharge.\n- Size is perfect. You can carry it around in your bag, but still feel it is big enough to get the full video experience.\n\nThings needed:\n- Really want skype and kindle apps completed soon.\n- More Apps - while growing pretty quickly, I would like to see more.\n\nThe best part, is Blackberry is continually improving the experience. I believe I have had 3 updates since buying it and each update has improved the experience. With all the planned improvements coming in the months ahead, I basically feel it is \"future proof\" for the next couple of years, at least."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I went and played with a number of tablets in stores, including the iPad 2, the Xoom, the Galaxy Tab (7-inch), and a few others. The Playbook was my personal favorite, easily.  I liked the iPad, but the size was the determining factor. The Playbook is really portable, and I can take it with me anywhere I go.  I didn't feel that would be the same with the iPad (or any 10-inch device).  The Playbook is smooth and powerful, and multitasks much better than any of the other devices. The iPad does have a ton of apps, but the Playbook has Flash support, which was another big distinction between the two. The number of available Playbook apps is continually growing as well. I read some negative reviews of the Playbook, but most seemed short-sighted. This is a brand new operating system (QNX), and what you see now is just the tip of the iceberg.  This has replaced my laptop for most purposes already, and with future updates planned (which will add Android support, native email, and more) this tablet has a very bright future!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "As a satisfied user of several Blackberry phones, I was delighted when the Playbook was announced. It was marketed as an extension and a major enhancement of my Blackberry Torch phone. My primary use was to be as a business tool.\n\nWhen the Playbook finally did come out, Amazon did not have it in stock. So I purchased the 64GB model thru Blackberry's web site, [...] I regret every day not waiting to purchase it from Amazon, because the Blackberry site will NOT accept the Playbook for a refund once you opened the package.\n\nThe Playbook has a very comfortable form factor. The build quality seems to be very high, and the video hardware is great, as evidenced by the resolution of the sample video clip.\n\nUnfortunately, the Playbook was prematurely released to market, considering that it is new hardware and a new operating system. Using it feels like I'm in an \"alpha\" test phase, not even \"beta\". My experience has been very disappointing. Suggest you visit the support forums at [...] and [...] to get detailed information about the Playbook. There are literally thousands of postings about Playbook's problems and serious usability limitations.\n\nThe PlayBook does not meet my minimum requirements as a business tool for the following major reasons:\n1) The touch screen freezes randomly.\n2) The unit \"locked up\" three times, requiring a hard reset, which wiped out data.\n3) Missing many essential computer functions and commands, just two examples: a)Can not open e-mail attachments. b)Lacks a functioning file system.\n4) Very few solid, useful applications available.\n5) Not reliable running commands, functions and applications - sometimes they just do not run.\n6) Will not sync up to about half of the 23 public, unsecured Wi-Fi hot spots I tried.\n7) Short battery life, drains power even when turned off."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I've had my playbook for over a week now, and I feel like I can finally write an objective review.  I'll have to admit, I am a blackberry \"fan boy\", I have had a blackberry for years now, and I currently have a Bold 9700, so I am able to bridge my devices, but this is an in-depth look with as little \"bias\" as possible.\n\nPros :\n--------------\nHardware - This is truly an impressive piece of hardware.  The construction is fantastic, its easy to hold, its light, and it feels solid in my hands.  The screen is fantastic, very crisp and displays images/videos/text with very sharp clarity.  I loaded up a bunch of pictures on my playbook just so I can look at the beautiful screen.  Everything is so clear, its such a pleasure to look at.  The device is also very fast, launching applications, loading web pages, and switching between apps are blazingly fast.  The camera is also good.  The back facing one is 5 MP and it takes good pictures, and HD quality video (however no flash :( )\n\nEase of Use -  I have to admit when I first tried it out at Best Buy, I had no idea what I was doing, and I couldn't figure out how to do anything.  I've had plenty of apple devices so I thought the missing \"Home\" button was an issue, and it left me scratching my head.  However, once I read up on it a little more, and found you can do everything with some simple gestures, I was hooked.  I multi-task a lot, and switching between applications is so easy, just a simple swipe from the bezel in and you're in a different app.  Bringing up the \"Home\" screen, closing apps, getting to the status bar are all easily done with some simple gestures.  I have to say, now that I've gotten used to it, I love it and could never go back to the \"Apple\" way!\n\nMulti-tasking - As I mentioned, I am really used to multi-tasking, so switching between applications is just what I do.  I might read some articles, then browse a site, change the music, and then go back to reading the news.  This is all a snap with the playbook, and the speed at which it does it is seamless.\n\nForm Factor - This is a preference but for me the 7\" form factor is great.  I don't really like watching videos on handheld devices (or even my laptop) so this was not a big requirement.  I tried out the Xoom and iPad 2 and I have to say, it was stellar at showing off videos.  But, I felt it was a little cumbersome, and if I wanted to just grab a device, check up on some scores, and look at some news, I wanted it to be easy to hold in one hand.  Also, due to its size, its very easy to carry, and I don't feel like I am holding a laptop.\n\nBrowser - This is great.  Every page I normally go to loads perfectly, and with the flash support, I get the full web experience.  Also, going to foreign sites renders the characters properly as well.  The only issue I've seen is on some of the more advanced sites, the pages will complain that I am on an \"older browser\" but that also means I am getting the full version of the site, and not a mobile version.\n\nBattery Life - I wanted to call this out because before the 1.0.5 OS update, this was a HUGE issue.  The playbook would drain power like nobody's business, and I couldn't even leave it on standby overnight.  However, this was all fixed with the recent update, now I can browse around and use apps for a few hours, and still have plenty of battery.  Just the other day, I left my playbook on standby overnight, and it only drained a few percentage points.  So what was a huge negative has become a positive with a simple update.  This also goes to show you, RIM is committed to releasing updates quickly and getting the OS up to par with other devices out there.\n\nCons :\n--------------\nLacking Apps - This is probably the single biggest complaint you read about, \"not enough apps\".  This is a real issue.  A lot of my favorite apps are missing, including Pandora, Kindle, KeePass (password management) and SSH (sys admin software).  These are key apps I use on my bold every day, and without it, it is a big issue.  However, one recent addition to the app world has boosted the score for me, and thats the blackberry news reader.  I was using GeeReader since that was the only decent RSS feed reader available, but blackberry just released the news reader, and it is fantastic.  I do see new apps crop up everyday in app world, and the Android app reader is going launch soon, so I think this will improve.  (the FB app, word and acrobat apps are great as well)\n\nLack of Connectivity - If you're on wireless, the playbook is great, but without it, it is seriously disabled.  I tried to take it to the gym to try it out while I work out, and I couldn't do much even when bridged.  The reason being, the bridge browser is so slow, I couldn't use it.  This could be partly due to my bold, but still, it was unusable.  I did get tethering to work, but I tried to install an app, and that didn't work either, so there were some limitations there as well.  I think if you're not on wifi, there will be some issues with using it.\n\nUPDATE 2\n-------\nI mentioned that the small power button was an issue due to coming out of standby, but there's actually a \"swipe\" shortcut.  All you have to do is swipe from bezel to bezel, and that brings the playbook out of standby, so no more fiddling around with the small power button!  Previous comment is below for reference\n\n(Small Power Button - When I first read complaints about this, I thought people were being nitpicky since how often do you use the power button?  Well as it turns out quite a bit.  The reason is, its the only way to come out of standby for the playbook.  I setup my device to standby after a few minutes to conserve power, and so whenever it goes to standby, I have to press the power button, and I end up doing it at least 2-3 times to get it right.)\n\nUPDATE\n-------\n\nI originally commented about the bad memory management, but it looks like this was also fixed in the 1.0.5 OS release.  Now, when there are no apps running, there is almost 700 MB of free memory, and even with the browser open, I still have 500+ MB free.  This should allow me to run way more apps at a time, and see less of the \"automatic\" closing that I saw before.  Previous comment is below for reference\n\n(Bad Memory management - This is a big sticking point for me.  The playbook has 1 gb of ram, so I didn't think it would be an issue but boy is it ever!  First off, when you start up the playbook, there's only 450 MB of memory free.  Then, if you launch the browser, another 200+ MB is gone right there.  So, if you have more than a few apps open and the browser, the playbook will just start closing apps automatically.  When this first happened, I thought pages were crashing because of the flash or lots of media content, but after some poking around, I realized it was because of the \"low\" memory.  Also, when I say \"low\" memory, its not like 50 mb, its more like anything under 150 MB and the playbook could start closing apps automatically.)\n\n--------------\n\nOverall, I love my playbook, and I want to give it 5 stars, but I just can't.  Once there are more apps available, this will be a solid 5 stars.  Also, for non blackberry users, the lack of a native mail client will be a big turn off.  But because the browser is so capable, it should ease the pain slightly.  The playbook is a great device for RIM to build off of, and I think the next coming months will be key for them, and if they can address some the issues, it will be a true force in the tablet market."}

I could leave it in places where i would have never left any other table with my Email, Contacts, Notes and all the rest that is bridged to my phone. The bridge feature is a feature that enabled me that ease of mind. No other tablet can do that, and that is key for any traveling business person. I think for the business mind its awesome.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I've had my Playbook now for a couple weeks, and find it to be almost (but not quite) perfect for my use.\n\nIt's very fast, perfectly tailored for multitasking, and the OS/User interface is designed explicitly for the tablet hardware (not a cell phone or a laptop).  I love the bezel gesture system; it allows the screen to be used entirely for apps, meaning no screen space \"wasted\" on OS buttons/menus/status bars.  If you need to see the status bar on the Playbook, you simply swipe down from the corner of the screen bezel and it appears.  If you need to access the App's menus, you simply pull down from the top bezel, otherwise it's off screen entirely.  Going back to the \"home\" screen is a simple swipe up from the bottom bezel.  Everything is off screen until you need it, and accessing it when you do want it is easy and natural.\n\nThe size of the tablet is another huge plus for me, as I find smartphone touchscreens just a bit too small to be comfortable, and larger tablets too clumsy to hold and too large to be truly portable.\n\nOn the negative side, there's still no native SDK (software development kit) for the Playbook, and most current apps are built with Adobe Flash/AIR.  There's a definite difference in the quality of the many of the Flash/AIR apps, with many of them being a bit sluggish or feature lacking compared to apps built by RIM or with Webworks.  Also, the power button is every bit as bad as you may have heard, being very difficult to press in the best of circumstances.  Luckily, you'll almost never have to use it, so it's not a huge issue.\n\nMy final grade: A-/B+, hopefully becoming a solid A when the NDK comes out and more apps are released."}

Sometimes my life seems to depend on it, so, I was really waiting for a product like this Playbook to be out in the market. I went to the closest Staples and got me one (16Gb for $499.00 + tax)...they had plenty of them anyway. The disappointment that fallowed is such a shame given the Tremendous Amount of Technology Packed in this Cool Gadget.\n\nGraphics: As said before...breathtaking, out of this world.\n\nMultitasking: Flawless...impressive.\n\nSpeed: Darn fast!\n\nSet up: Ridiculously Easy.\n\nNetwork and Connectivity: Here is where the two stars come to play. Through the Wi-Fi connection it worked above my expectation. When paired through my BB Smartphone 8530 with software version 5.0 it was a mess. The internet connection was very slow and dropped every two minutes and also every time I tried to transfer a file through BB Bridge.  In addition, I manage my life through a personal Synology home server which normally I access smoothly anywhere in the world from my laptop. The BB Browser does not support the Synology application, therefore I could not access it.\n\nBusiness Apps: Very good if the paired connection to my smart phone didn't drop so many times.\n\nSize: Perfect.\n\nEverything on this tablet is perfect except the very two things I wanted it for Mobility and Remote Data a\nAccessibility.  Also, there is no way to pair the BB phone via a physical cord.\n\nSo my bottom line is...if you are going to use this tablet for business...wait until they fix the glitches and lower the price. If you want this tablet to sit at your local coffee shop with a Wi-Fi connection and surf the net,then make a trip whenever you have the time and buy one, I guarantee, you will have an awesome experience and I guarantee there will be plenty waiting for you at the store.

The updates have fixed a lot of initial issues and it keeps getting better everyday. Give it a little more time and you will see this tablet and its apps will mature tremendously. Remember, only recently did the developers get the SDK. If you are a Blackberry owner looking for a tablet, this is for you. Other phone types may want to wait till the Android compatibility  comes this Summer. Also BBM is slated to move across iOS and Android platforms. Hopefully this will advance RIM's market share in the highly competitive mobile phone market. Go try one out today and see for yourself."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "I own the iPad 1. I like it. I don't love it. The apps are great. But it is large and cumbersome. It doesn't really multi-task. And I hate the way it handles email. I use a Blackberry Torch phone. I love the way it handles email. And the apps are very good. Fewer. But very good.\n\nSo it was with some trepidation and excitement I bought the Blackberry Playbook. The trepidation was because of the advanced reviews which universally panned it. I looked at it, held it, and bought it. And I will tell you it is one piece of stunning equipment.\n\nThe build is much better than the iPad. In fact it is extraordinary. The screen is absolutely stunning. The machine loads the applications fast but NOT as fast as you see on the commercials. The browser blows the iPad Safari browser out of the water. It is very fast and of course has Flash. The camera front and back are very good.\n\nBut do you know what makes this tablet? The OS. It is extraordinary. You bring out Apps with a touch. You scroll through open apps by beginning at the left or right bezel and swiping toward the center. The context menus are opened by swiping down when the application is open. See a subtle alert in the top left hand corner, swipe diagonally from the the bezel to the center and viola there is a notification of your email. To wake it up swipe from the top bezel to the bottom. No more clicking a darn button. Thank you Blackberry. That alone was genius.\n\nAs I said I carry a Blackberry so through the Blackberry Bridge it tethers to my Torch. Emails and files. Everything, except the apps (different OS of course) is available on my Playbook. And I don't have to add on a data plan for 3G. A 3G phone Playbook is coming out in the summer they say for those who do not carry Blackberry phones.\n\nI am waiting for the following apps - Dropbox (although I can transfer files in and out via the web), a free hand note taker and a better PDF program or a more beefy Adobe Reader app. And I am sure they will come.\n\nNow to the reviews: They claimed the OS was not finished. Not true. They claimed multiple shutdowns and freezes. Not true. They poo-poo'd tethering through Blackberry Bridge. OK I am saving myself $30 a month up here in Canada or $360 a year in not having a 3G capability under a separate plan. And the tethering is flawless for both email and web surfing since the Playbook comes with a Bridge Browser that uses your phones' plan. So a person saves $360 a year and it gets criticized? Unbelievable! The apps. Yes there are fewer but there are new ones appearing everyday and they are above average and to my mind are as good as or better than the iPad. The negative reviews are baffling; truly, truly baffling.\n\nI couldn't wait to get the iPad. I was enchanted. With the new iPad 2 I wasn't enchanted. In fact it is anything but.\n\nThe Blackberry Playbook on the other hand is simply astounding. I throw it in my briefcase. And away I go. I pull it out at a meeting or airport and it is understated and private. Will it take its rightful place in the tablet market? Not if jingoistic reviewers have their way. But it should. It should if build, function, cost effectiveness, reliability, and fun mean anything to anybody."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "\"It's coming soon\" is a refrain you will hear quite often with respect to the BlackBerry Playbook.  I have had my 32GB wifi model for about a week.  (I bought it from Staples for less than you see here.)  The physical tablet is four and half stars.  It is a perfect size, the screen is beautiful and the weight is ideal.  It is roughly the same size as a 3d generation Kindle.  Half a star deduction for the top buttons which do not feel like they are very high quality.\n\nIncluded in the box are some brief instructions, a folding blade charger, a micro-usb cable, a nice foam pouch case, and a screen wipe.\n\nThere are a few negatives: (1) a lot of websites think the browser is for a blackberry phone and auto-direct you to the mobile version of their website; (2) the browser does not allow you to rename bookmarks, reorder bookmarks, or put bookmarks into folders; (3) the GPS is not yet functional - it's in there, but has not been enabled by the firmware - this feature is \"coming soon\"; (4) there are two very high quality cameras, but the software is limited only only permitting you to chat with other PlayBook users; (5) there is no Kindle App.\n\nWhen linked to your blackberry smartphone via bluetooth you get a mirror of the email, contacts, calendar, to do, BBM and memo pad found on your phone.  You also get access to files on your blackberry (even the microSD), but cannot open video or audio files - just documents.  There is something called the \"bridge browser\" which allows you to surf the internet through your phone's web browser and 3G connection.  This is different from tethering because the carriers don't charge for it.  The PlayBook also allows tethering which gives you full data access (although not to app world for some reason).  Some carriers charge for tethering, some don't.  Apparently AT&T doesn't even allow their customers to use the Bridge - which is a HUGE drawback if you happen to have AT&T.\n\nThe lack of apps is the largest drawback.  As of this writing, there is no Kindle app (a huge drawback), no Skype app, no Netflix app, and no MLB app.  You cannot watch Netflix videos on the browser or your MLB.tv subscription.  You CAN watch amazon instant videos.  They look beautiful.  The app content is neither quality nor quantity.\n\nThere is a huge amount of potential, but unfortunately a lot of that is \"coming soon\" - and isn't there right now.  When is \"soon\"?  Nobody knows.  One good thing is that firmware updates come out every few weeks and each adds functions.  Since there are no carriers involved in rolling out firmware, RIM has full control and can do it quickly.\n\nSome have mentioned problems with battery charging - I haven't had that.  My battery charges pretty quickly and goes to 100%.  I can use it for nearly 15 hours before I get a low battery warning with about 10% left.  Some have complained about the power button being hard to push.  Mine is small and recessed, but I can easily push it.\n\nThe screen is absolutely beautiful.\n\nYou can use your existing blackberry charger, but it will take much longer to charge.  The included charger can charge your existing blackberry (micro USB) without harm.  There is also an available quick-charging stand - it is expensive but works really well (I have it).\n\nThe BlackBerry PlayBook could be an amazing tablet - five stars.  However, it is now a bit of a work in progress at this point and I can only give it three stars as it currently stands - It is only OK."}

I've had it for two weeks and I absolutely love it! This is the tablet that is going to unchain me from my desk and from the weight of my laptop. My five stars are not because it's perfect but because the hardware and OS are solid, the experience is amazing, and RIM is giving every indication of being totally committed to this product. I'm writing this during the week of the BlackBerry World Conference (wish I could have attended!) and I was extremely impressed by the CEOs of Microsoft and Adobe on stage to discuss their partnerships with RIM as well as by the demos of things to come.\n\nPrevious reviewers have described the PlayBook's features. My favorites so far are the incredible free bridging with my BlackBerry phone, working in email with a large screen, great internet experience, the size and weight that allow me to carry it in my purse, and the HDMI port that allows me to stream a video to my HD TV. I'm still learning all the features, which expand daily as new apps are added. I think RIM has a real winner here."}

Preferred the Palm Web OS over iPhone iOS.\nNo iTunes, no apple lock in and control.\n\nBut battery life was bad. Slider keyboard sucked.\nI wanted to support Web OS, but sadly I had to return it.\nNow I have the long name\nHP Palm Pre Plus 2\nphone, but its in the box. Unused.\n\nSimilarly with the\nRIM Blackberry Playbook Tablet.\n\nCan there be a longer name?\n\nPlaybook has a great interface, QNX is nice (Been a fan of RTOS for over 20 years), flash is nice. First tablet I found that can watch various streaming web sites like dramafever and dramacrazy.\n\nOddly I could not pay any youtube videos out of the box after enabling wi-fi.\nthen either the firmware update or something, and now it seems to do youtube ok.\n\nBattery life is bad. If I haven't used it in a day or two and try to use it, its already dead from being in standby. Its plugged into the wall as I type, waiting for it to charge before cleaning it out and boxing it back to the store.\n\nMy nook color can be in standby, with the same size screen, and a week later, its still got more than 1/2 batt full and ready to go when I need it.\nAnd we all know the legendary battery life of the iPad and A4 processor. The benchmark has been set.\n\nThe playbook tiny round red and silver power button on the top is also annoying. Too small for my big fingernails. Need to carry around a pen tip.\n\nHow to fix it?\n$299 with this current battery, and it may still not succeed, but I would probably keep it. Much better battery life is sorely needed along with a competitive price, especially since they are the underdog, and late to the game behind iOS, and Android.\n\nIt's going back to the store this week, sad to say. Going the try the Acer 10\" $449 that just came out. See if batt life is better and if flash works on that.\n\nI worry that QNX will suffer the same fate as BeOS, Palm, and other great platforms that were acquired.\n\nRIM is lost and confused. Like Microsoft, Nokia, and Sony. They don't know how to fight the good fight with 'Big Brother' (Apple). HP Web OS tablet is even later, so I really worry about Palm Web OS viability."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "A bit about me first - I am a techno-nerd. I LOVE gadgets. Large, small, you name it. After eyeballing many tablets, including the iPad, Xoom, Samsung and others I chose the 64GB Blackberry Playbook. Why? For one, because it is the right size. I can put it in my purse and carry it about with me. More reasons - it has spectacular graphics - true 1080p HD and it supports flash. It has a camera and an HD camcorder. It has a solid feel in your hands, the touch screen is very responsive and intuitive. After playing with it for a short span of time I now zoom from app to app. One of the (many) things I find amazing is that the tablet does not lag while running many concurrent apps - I'm not talking small apps, but processor intensive ones. The battery life is pretty good too - I've played for over 10 hours before I had to recharge it. The screen is spectacular - I said that already didn't I?\n\nOne thing I have read on various sites is that there aren't \"many apps\" available. HELLO - it is new - just released actually. How many apps were there for the iPad when it first came out? New apps appear daily and this summer it will run Android apps. That just exponentially increased the quantity of fodder for app hounds like me. The Android apps will be available through Blackberry App World. Read more about this on Android Central. Angry Birds anyone? It's also a boss gaming tablet for you gamers out there.\n\nI have a huge iTunes library. One of the reasons I purchased the 64GB version was for the music. RIM made it so easy to import tunes from iTunes. First download Desktop manager and install. Plug in the Playbook. It installs the drivers and voila! It sniffs the installed iTunes and asks you what you would like to sync to the Playbook. I also read a lot of technical magazines I get electronically. I have these saved off to a folder on my PC. Now I copy them to my Playbook and read them where ever I am.\n\nI can connect to the internet a few ways - with the wireless ability it has, or tethering to my mobile phone or, if you have a Blackberry running version 5 or above you can use the Bridge to gain access to the internet while about. I have scratched just the surface of this amazing tablet. It has so much more I could talk about.\n\nI love my Playbook. I am so glad I waited for its release. WOW\n\nUpdate 7.01.2011\n\nI've had the Playbook for over two months, use daily and have taken it with me everywhere I go. As such, I have more information and thoughts to share.\n\nMy Playbook recently traveled to Universal Studios and Disney's Magic Kingdom. Beautiful pictures and video were captured. I am a camera fiend - my Nikon D80 was left at home by an oversight and panic (withdrawal is more like it) set in. I must say that my Playbook saved the day. Would this completely replace my Nikon? For me, no. I am a lover of SLR/DSLR's. However it does a very nice job rendering photographs in a pinch. I shot beautiful 1080p video as well.\n\nApps - I have 183 apps so far on my Playbook and the choices available increases daily.\n\nThe browser is something to behold on this thing. It is fast, renders pages beautifully and the flash content looks incredible. As the Playbook supports flash, a great deal of things can be had directly via the browser without the requirement of an app.\n\nRE: the noise about the 'too small' power button - non-issue really. You turn the Playbook on by swiping the screen from top to bottom. If the timeout is too long, you can alter this through the settings. About the only time you ever have to touch the button is to turn it on from a total power down. It's more an issue of a habit to use a button than anything else. Once you drop the button desire, the puny size is perfect.\n\nRE: the noise regarding it wasn't ready - I've used my tablet daily for well over two months and I haven't encountered a single issue. No freezing, nothing at all. Ask me how many times I've had to reset my iPod or my PC/laptop?\n\nRE: the noise regarding the immediate OS update - as a software engineer I appreciated the fact RIM had an update issued right after the tablet shipped. That means they fixed/added new features that the initial install didn't contain. This doesn't mean the OS wasn't ready - it was. They just were able to roll out an update soon after the release. How often is iTunes updated??? How often is Windows OS updated? Why is RIM bashed for a standard process? Ah, the Bizarro World we live in..."}

I enjoyed the blackberry phone and its business functions,  but evil Verizon sharks sales people talked me into the droid, and it is still a disaster phone\nso when bb came out with playbook i was so excited, YAY!i can have portable business again, create docs, make appointments, do things like bb does only bigger, so far RIM has created a pipe dream right now, knowing people like me will inhale.....cough cough i beg to differ now....chips anyone?\n\nPROS: yes it runs flash but you knew that already\n really cool operating system sleek and crispy picture, better than ipad!!\n  its super portable, and size is not so bad really for the quality is fantastic!! operates smooth and quick with access to many menu at once when you need them with a swipe of the finger, does have Microsoft office features built in for power point excel and word. has a mini usb port.  90 free tech support and they are really friendly once you get past the in initial operator to really find out whats your problem.\nhas a .com tab on the keyboard, which i thought well finally instead of having to type it all the time.\n\nCONS:sometimes a little apprehensive to touching something to go back or stop/enter/go. some basic missing icons on keyboard, like question mark and exclamation, in which have to go search to they symbols for that.\nBIGGIE HERE, no calender....huh? why????? who dosnt have a calender available anymore??? BIG rim mistake, but they figured well let the people bridge to  bb phone, yet another fussy thing to deal with, too many devices and things to sync.  BB made a stupid mistake with that,\n\nthe app store is really skinny, a few games, as with any new app creation there are bugs to be ironed out (remember first i pad release?)  and the fact that i just put down 600 and some change to have a device that is still up and coming,\n\nhearsay is they want you to wait until summer for the good apps to come out? but yet get it now....\nwhy that will be too late to return to the store by that point because it the contracts aren't ironed out with hulu or kindle then i have lost out (those are two things i read on web that made me go get one only to find out its not actually available)\n\nneedless to say i have a ipad reserved\n\nmaybe in two years it will be good i recommend not getting one right now.\n\n they \"say\" droid apps will be made available? (not a guarantee because its not in out yet and we don't know if that's an empty promise)\ni have one of those droid phones and had to weed out the buggy apps to some good ones, but how do we know those apps will work on the tablet? because those are phone apps.\n\nOVERALL: it seems Blackberry is on the right path but got on it too soon, their mature nature came unglued when they pre-ejaculated the playbook! its like they got too excited and spurt it out too soon! and the reason why? because they ran out of money to pay their developers and need more cash flow\n\nits making me run to the i pad2 i don't know why but at least hes got something under his screen..and app store.."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B004UL34GW", "review": "Admittedly, I don't have a Playbook yet; I'm waiting for one to be delivered to me as part of a developer's program.  However, I have played with it considerably in the form of its software emulator.  I can speak of the hardware itself, since it was emulated by my desktop PC, and I can't speak of the apps themselves, since there were none; but what I was able to see was the web browser and user interface.  In that regards, the Playbook seems well laid out and organized, and it seems easy to use.  Compared to the iPad (which I've used only in the Apple store), there are neat gestures that increases the efficiency of the interface.  It took a while to realize that some actions are activated by gestures, but once you get the hang of it, the tablet becomes very fluid.  It would be nice to have a keyboard that can be reconfigured in terms of size.  It does take up a considerable portion of the screen, but given the intrinsic touchscreen interface and gestures, the keyboard is not going to be of primary concern.  Before I got involved in the developer's program, the Playbook didn't really interest me, but once I got a chance to use the software emulator, I have to admit that I'm looking forward to getting mine in the mail.  Hopefully I will be able to update this review soon, once I get it.\n\nUPDATE:  I got my free Playbook.  It is as fluid as I had expect, but having it my hand gives me a better feel on how it handles.  RIM went the 7\" format which both pros and con.  Obviously it make the UI smaller, but that is not necessarily the end all or be all of the design.  The smaller size makes this a very mobile, hand portable platform.  Moreover, the smaller screen size make everything much more smooth and crisp.  Given the landscape layout, rather than thinking of the devise has having a small screen, I think it's more appropriate to think if it as just the upper half of the iPad in portrait mode.\n\nThe hardware is fast and smooth.  There is no lag, even with multiple apps open at the same time.  And the gestures make moving from app to app smooth and efforts.  The playbook still need some way to scroll, as with a trackpad, but otherwise this is a easy to use device.  My only wish is for a built-in GPS to make this a perfect travel companion.\n\nThe software does need some tweaking, but this is not fundamental limitations.  Of course, the lack of an native email viewer is noticeable, but this is not a permanent situation and is a very fixable problem.  And, as so many have pointed out, there aren't as many apps as iOS or Android, but the number of apps is a false issue.  The real question is on RIMs strategy to attract developers and how does their hardware make app useful.  On the first, as a app developer myself,  my one concern is that RIM has a very awkward process to upload and maintain have apps.  It's no worse than Apple's, but Apple is in a position to maintain their arrogance.  Hopefuly RIM will cleanup their process as they go from \"catch up\" mode to \"polishing\" mode.  However, on the latter question on the hardware, I can say the the hardware and UI is very powerful, much better than that in iOS, and it should enable very, very nice apps.  And given RIM's enterprise level infrastructure, particularly with security, I think this could be a truly powerful business platform."}
