Firmware support locked up during update using Kies 3, but Win7 64bit should have been using Kies 2.6, so the whole thing went sideways, halfway.  Tech support call walked me thru a factory-reset of firmware, and the stuck-halfway-update vanished.  Updating to newest firmware using Kies 2.6 worked okay (though all data stored on device was erased).  Overall, very good, would buy another."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "This is my review of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10.1. This review is not incentivized by Samsung in any way. I purchased the product for my own use.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 is the aforementioned companys latest foray into the midrange tablet market. With these tablets you're not likely to find a retina display or anything over 720p resolution, but they're more reasonably priced, and therefore, more likely to be adopted by more people.\n\nSpecifications\n\nProcessor: 1.2 GHz Quad Core\nMemory: 1.5GB\nStorage: 16GB with additional microSD slot\nDisplay: 1280800\nOperating System: Android Kit Kat 4.4 with Samsungs TouchWiz UI\nAs you can see, those specs really aren't too shabby, but they're definitely not bleeding edge technology. However, having the latest and greatest isn't always the best. For example, I recently purchased the higher end Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 and was utterly disappointed in it. Yes, the screen was beautiful but you could tell that not a lot of games had been properly coded for that resolution as the HD graphics appeared pixelated and blocky. Also, the Tab Pro suffered from massive lag and stuttering when when navigating through the operating system. You can read about my experience with that tablet here. It was promptly returned to Best Buy.\n\nBack to the Galaxy Tab 4.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, it runs Kit Kat 4.4 with Samsungs custom TouchWiz user interface over top. In my opinion, this isn't a bad thing since I have never been a fan of HTCs Sense UI. It sadly still comes packed full of bloatware that I almost always remove if possible.\n\nInitial Thoughts\n\nBeing an ex-member of the cult of Steve Jobs, I am still getting used to the Android world and the lack of high resolution displays in some products. The Galaxy S5, which I own, has the best display and form factor on the market right now. Are you listening Apple? Thankfully, there are cheaper Android tablets available that still offer a high quality user experience.\n\nOnce you go through the obligatory setup screens and sync your applications, the tablet is zippy and runs with no lag whatsoever. Overall memory utilization is low when using several apps at once and multi-tasking.\n\nDisplay\n\nOK, this is a 720p display. You will notice a difference if using an S5 and then the Galaxy Tab 4  but lets not compare the two. The 1280800 screen is actually quite beautiful and bright. This is one of the brighter screens Ive seen on a midrange tablet. Text is sharp as are the graphics, both are quickly rendered thanks to the 1.5GB RAM and quad core processor. Yes, I think it should be a 1080p panel, but its a $319 tablet.\n\nPerformance\n\nI was able to open apps and switch between them fairly quickly. This little tablet is definitely more responsive than its bigger, more expensive brother. Even under heavy use the Tab 4 performed excellent. Its able to handle video encoded to 1080p with no stutter, even though its obviously rendered at 720p on the screen. No complaints at all about performance.\n\nFinal Impressions\n\nIm still an Apple fanboy, just now living in an Android world. I really like the Galaxy Tab 4. Its fast, responsive, light, and does what I need it to do. I feel like for the most part, I could ditch my laptop when traveling. That is, as long as Im not running a GoPro, or editing HD video.\n\nThe display is not as sharp as I like, but the applications and games I use are not upated to be displayed yet at the higher resolutions on the Tab Pro.\n\nKit Kat has grown, the OS takes up about 4GB of the internal 16GB, and by the time you add-in the Samsung applications and associated bloatware, you have only about 9GB of usable space. That almost sounds like a Surface tablet, no? LOL Sorry, couldn't resist. Samsung says the answer is to use a microSD card  which you will want to do immediately. They state on their site, that a maximum of 64GB is supported, although I am tempted to buy a 128GB and try it. I know those work in the S5.\n\nSo, should you buy it? If you like new gadgets, sure. If you want a great performing Android tablet for a great price, absolutely. I cant really find anything wrong with this little guy. Its a keeper.\n\nUPDATE\n\nI pre-ordered the Galaxy Tab 4 on Amazon at $349. It was released May 1st, and it looks like the price was dropped to $319.99, making it an even better value."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "I have had 3 samsung tablets, and all of them had issues. All of them had the worse battery performance and the worse bugs I have ever seen. It was so bad, I thought after almost a year of use the battery in the tablet had just gone bad because when ever it dropped to 60%, it'd just shut down. So I went out, bought a new battery, got it all installed and I still had the exact same issue. It isn't the battery. The hardware is absolute trash. Two of my tablets had flickering screens. It's just flicker on and off, I even got one replaced and shortly later, it had the exact same issue. I have formatted this thing so many times in hopes that I could fix the issue, made sure all updates were on and I can not get these tablets to work without flaws. This one and the 2 Samsung 12.2 models that I've had are the exact reason why I will NEVER buy a Samsung or Android based tablet again. I have delt with Lenovo tablets, Asus and multiple standard computers and I have never seen such a terrible product as these. Do not buy these, after dealing with 3 of these tablets, it is safe to say that Samsung makes the worse tablets today. I would rather go with an Apple then invest in one of these again.\n\nEdit: So today I decided to try something out. I thought maybe the tablet was over heating so I pulled apart the back, let the battery hang out and waited to see. I noticed after a little bit the tablet was no longer shutting down at 60ish%. So I went to screw the battery back in, but leave the outer plate off. The moment I put the screws in for the battery trim, the tablet shut down.\n\nThe solution to the inadvertent shutdown on these tablets... remove the screws from the battery casing. Ever since I removed mine, the tablet no longer has problems. I am still leaving it with one star since I had to go through so much and make physical changes to the system in order for it to even work. Thanks Samsung."}

I use it primarily for controlling my Chromecast, as well as streaming videos, and writing notes in class. The software is more than excellent, and very comfortable to use, even for the most inexperienced of users. However, my primary issue is with the hardware.\n\nComparing it to the Galaxy Tab 3, it lacks backlit buttons, vibration feedback, and a whole bunch of sensors (the only sensor included is the accelerometer). I've never had any problems with any applications lagging or freezing due to lack of resources, so the memory and processor is pretty decent.\n\nThe battery is the only reason why I did not give 4 stars. Within writing this review (no background apps running, and at 30% brightness), I've used about 11% of battery life. I can not expect this battery to last more than 3 hours of continuous use. Last Summer, I once took my tablet out to play Pokemon GO, and I only got about 2 hours of use before it died (probably due to the use of GPS), and it died with 20% of life reporting. I've also noticed that the battery will report false percentages (this is a sign of a faulty battery).\n\nI wouldn't recommend getting this version; if you're looking for higher quality tablets, I would recommend looking at Samsung's newer products."}

Unfortunately, attempts to connect to my home wi-fi continued to fail as well as causing disonnect issues with my laptop and desktop computers. I returned the product and got another thinking that the wi-fi component was bad.  This new tablet connected to wi-fi right away and didn't disconnect my other devices. But, the tablet would stay connected to wi-fi no more than 60 to 90 sec. I did all the things suggested by others who had wi-fi issues with Samsung with no success. I returned the tablet and bought a Kindel Fire 10\". Not the slightest problem with the connectivity and function of the Kindel. Sorry Samsung, but your tablet wi-fi is a lemon."}

After that, no problem.  The apps and controls all work fine and in English.  If you need it, the manual can be downloaded in English (assuming you don't read Korean) via a PDF file.  The vendor also included an electrical adapter so the Korean charger plug can fit into a standard US socket.  Again, no issues.\n\nI don't mind having a Korean release since it was brand new, priced right, and works absolutely fine.  Little bit of a surprise since I didn't read the advert as closely as I should have.  But very easy to work around."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "This tablet has been wonderful. I love the 10 inch screen, the slick interface, and almost everything about this tablet. Previously, I was an Appleite, though I never was a die-hard. I was grandfathered into Apple's tablets and phones from my old-school iPods and then the iPod touch which I used as a wannabe smartphone until I broke down and actually got a smartphone. By then I'd already invested in a bunch of apps on the iTunes store. However, the whole time I kept with Apple, I begrudged the fact that Apple didn't play nicely with Google. I couldn't have control over certain settings and preferences that seemed logical and basic. I couldn't expand my storage (and that 8GB limit always plagued me at the worst times when I wanted to take a picture). Screen replacements on my iPhone 4 were a pain even for me, a decent techie.\n\nSamsung in general has been a nice gateway into the Android realm where many of my grievances with Apple have disappeared. It has an easy interface like Apple. I'm not as constrained as I felt before. I love the expandable storage. I even convinced my even stronger Appleite wife to get an identical tablet, and we've both now left our iPhones for Galaxy phones.\n\nAll in all, I've had very few complaints with the tablet. The only reason I knocked it a star was due to some charging overheating problems and overall slow battery charging. The problem ended up majorly being solved by purchasing a new charging cable. However, I was surprised that the tablet didn't have better protection from overheating and rebooting when the charging cable was giving it an inconsistent current or voltage. Also, the battery takes a pretty ridiculous time to charge. This might actually be solved with a new battery. But currently, this tablet (albeit one I purchased used) can't even charge overnight. To fully charge takes 12+ hours sometimes. I tend to fault the used hardware and the likely problematic battery, so I don't complain too much."}

The screen is very sharp and vibrant and the speakers are of good quality as well. I have barely put this thing down since it has arrived. All of the games and web pages I have been on thus far ran smoothly without much delay. That is one of the biggest pains in smaller sized electronics, but this tablet is an exception. If you are going to purchase a tablet, not just this one in particular, you should invest in a case with a built in keyboard as it makes using a great deal easier. I have a feeling this tablet will last me a long time because all of the Samsung products I have had consistently met my standards and has been durable. If you are debating on whether to get this tablet or a different one; you should definitely pick the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4."}

Ultimately, I was forced to return this because she wanted a Microsoft Surface Pro instead. However, the short time that I did own this tablet I got to play with a few of the features and I wished that I could have kept it for myself. In my opinion, why spend the money for a iPAD when Samsung has everything you need in one gadget? I think I may revisit this tablet since my Nexus is starting to let me down lately."}

The design is very nice and visually appealing, even without a case, the black looks very sleek as do the other colors. The apps and games are awesome and download fast. It's a decent price compared to other devices. The thing that sold me was how long the battery lasts, it charges really quick and at full battery I lasted days without charging it. It's great for when I want to watch movies, play videos, listen to or read books and play games, plus you can get cool app and system launchers to match your style. The durability seems pretty good, I feel confident if I drop it without a case. It has great sound and the brightness is great for watching videos. I also like the ability to dim screen for late night reading."}

After that, bought 3 other tablets from Samsung (different models, including Note Pro).\nAs of Dec 2015 the original tablet (bought in Oct 2014) started to act up regarding the battery charge. The battery indication would drop from 40% to 2% in a blink of an eye and sometimes would take days to charge 100%.\nKeep in mind that tablet was used no different from the other tablets or phones. No abusive use or reckless use of it. Reading several forums, it seems to be an issue with Samsung tablets. Since then, one other tablet that we own presented the issue.\nThe first family tablet was a Motorola Xoom and it is still going strong as far as speed, updates and specially battery life."}

I don't know about everyone else but my eyes get tired after\nlong hours on a computer or notebook.  In addition to just turning down the brightness of the screen,  the best remedy to protect my eyes has been to buy Apple products where one can use reverse video, viz. white letters on a black screen rather than black letters on a bright, white screen.  I use google software all the time but I have to stay away from  android laptops and tablets with their  bright, white screens in order to protect my eyes.  Thus far, only Apple builds screens that allow for white letters on a black screen rather than the opposite.  I hope someone at Google or Samsung or ... is listening.\nAnd ... I imagine that reverse video  prolongs battery life.  For Apple users who haven't tried reverse video, the keystroke to use is\nControl/Alt/Command8.  That keystroke reverses  black on white to white on black and the opposite as well."}

I can lay in bed and browse the web, check email and play a few games. I'm a teacher so I also use the tablet to save lesson plans, no problem. It's easy to carry, not too clunky, very light weight.  I take it with me every where. It did come with an SD card but, I haven't had to use it just yet so it holds a lot of my apps just fine. It keeps a good charge as well. If I weren't an avid candy crush (and other games) player the charge could last longer than a couple days. Otherwise,  I feel a couple days charge is good for what I use it for. I'm always using it and never power off. I love my tablet."}

My favorite thing about it, besides for its crystal clear display (and a bunch of the other qualities noted in the item description) is its split screen capability, so now when I write my school essays and paraphrase everything from another source, I no longer have to switch screens, because I can type, see my essay, AND look at what I'm copying--ahem paraphrasing--at the SAME TIME. It's wonderful, really, and saves me lots of switching between screens time (approximately 32.4 seconds per essay).\n\nP.S. I in way condone plagiarism, but I do condone buying the Samsung Galaxy 4 tab and letting it eat your life and personal relationships away like it has mine. You won't regret it!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "I received a Galaxy Tab 4 for my birthday as a gift from my mother. Six months later I still enjoy using it every day!\n\nThis Android tablet has a beautiful 10.1 inch TFT screen with vivid colors and excellent viewing angles; two features Samsung screens are renowned for. The screen is excellent for web browsing, watching videos and viewing photos. It is comfortable to use for reding text dispite it's modest 1280x800 resolution. The luminosity is great indoors and outdoors. Multiple people are able to view the screen from wide angles without color shifting or other compromise in image quality.\n\nPerformance is exceptionally good wether its for playing high end games like CSR Racing or Real Racing 3. There are stereo speakers on the sides of this tablet and the audio quality through them is good for general use. The volume is loud and clear, however the quality resembles laptop speakers. I recommend headphones or a bluetooth headset for high quality audio playback. Web browsing is rendered smoothly, even when loading desktop web pages. The dual band WiFi delivers excellent range and reduces page load times.\n\nThe Tab 4 comes with a few pre-installed apps. That considered, I perused the application manager and disabled/Uninstalled features I won't use, just as one can do to a desktop computer to improve the responsiveness beyond that out of the box. Once features like S-Voice (think Siri) and Google search activaton via the home key were disabled responsiveness improved dramatically.\n\nBattery life is a major high point of this tablet. At 50% screen brightness I go through two days of browsing, gaming and other multimedia like video calling and charge on the second day with ~8 hours screen on time. Usage time is increased by manually adjusting the brightness to ambient light levels, but note there is not an ambient light sensor on the Tab 4. Adjusting the brightness to ambient levels, the Tab 4 manages 12 hours screen on time with power saving disabled and all radios/antennas on.\n\nThe build and aesthetics are decent, 8/10. The tablet is extremely thin; sometimes it feels too thin to hold without a case, so I keep it in a rubberized case available seperately. It is light enough to hold up and watch movies without getting uncomfortable. The thinness combined with performance of this tablet really gives a high end feel to the overall experience.\n\nI recommend this tablet to anybody looking for a quality, name brand device that performs exceptionally well in daily use that truly delivers in multimedia applications. I am highly stisfied with my Galaxy Tab 4 and don't have any complaints in build quality or performance."}

I was upgrading this tablet I purchased used from a pawn shop two years ago used. This one STILL has superior speed, graphics, and feels better in the hand. It has never crashed or glitched. I might now upgrade to the Tab S, but if you don't need the latest, this is a reliable piece of hardware that ypdated itself to the latest android version. I'll be doing samsung again for sure. I'm able to run my laptop in the house with team view almost as if this tablet was running the pc apps itself!  LOVE THIS TABLET! And I am a tech geek! I have the latest laptop, an lg g3, and an lg watch r!  Geeked out. Even a ham radio guy, so I'm tech picky, and writing this review November 2015 even after playing with the very latest tablets! I also watch amazon movies all the time with it with incredible screen resolution!  I've dropped it a couple times, knocked up the corners, but because it is well built, held up well.  Something to consider if you are rough on your stuff like me. By the way, buy the glass screen protector over the plastic film. The film scratches up over time and can have bubbles.  The glass, which I also put on my watch and phone somehow removes the bubbles on its own.  Get your cables here on amazon. I recommend Bluerigger."}

I use it primarily to listen to music, read and check email. I have an extensive music library and so I purchased a 64 GB micro SD card to store music and personal files.\n\nMy initial attempt to transfer from the original tab with a 16 GB micro SD card to the Tab 4 was a disaster.  Many of the MP3 files were empty; WMA files did not play and only about 1/3 of the songs were functional. I put the 16 GB card in the new Tab 4 and it worked fine.\n\nI re-formatted the 64 GB card and started from scratch transferring files from my computer to the new TABs card.  Some of the files worked, some didn't but the WMA files played OK.\n\nThat took a few hours.  Then I transferred 25 GB of MP3s.  That took several hours.  They were on the card.  I saw them.  Not all of them worked, probably about 1/3 of the 5000.  About 30 minutes later they were gone, vanished.  No longer on the card.  The folder is empty and I now cannot write, delete, change any files or folders on the card.  I did not write protect the card.\n\nWhat is going on?  The device is now seemingly worthless for my purposes. I don't necessarily want a refund; I want a device that does what it said it was going to do.\n\nPlease advise?"}

I personally do not like small screens tablet, so I believe this has a moderate size between phones and laptops. I use it mainly for internet browsing and video streaming form Youtube, Netflix, and Amazon. If you keep the display brightness below 55%, the battery life is really very good. I think it can easily support like 5 hours of continuous video streaming or even more.\n\nThe good. This tablet has a very good battery life keeping the brightness in a fair level. It is really fast and responsive with a large screen that is suitable for watching your favorite TV series. The touch experience is also great. Never had any problems with the usability of this tablet.\n\nThe bad. One drawback of this device is the camera. I am not a fan of taking or even viewing pictures, but sometimes I need to capture like a piece of paper or a note of some kind to come back to it later. The camera fails me in this case. It is also hard to read bar or QR codes with this camera. Another bad thing in this device is the lack of LTE data plans support (no SIM card). Which means you need to rely on WiFi to connect to the internet.\n\nOverall, I am really happy with this device. I would like to have a better camera and LTE support but not for a much higher price. If you are always within a WiFi range (most of us are these days) and you need a tablet for simple tasks like browsing, reading, streaming, or may be simple text processing, this tablet can completely fulfill your needs."}

I received it as a Christmas present from my parents last year. At first, I loved it. It wasn't as nice as the iPad (app wise mainly) but for my purposes (games and surfing the web) it was great. Even the price point was better than the iPad. Well fast forward 8+ months, the tablet is worthless!  It started acting up 5 months in with the device overheating and force closing \"running\" apps. Funny how it would always tell me more apps were running than actually were, lol. This problem occurred sporadically for the next few months. Now it does it every time the device is turned on, within minutes of being on. The battery drains at a rapid pace as well, from a full 100% (device overheats so I restart, hard reset, etc) down to the 30s. Don't even try to use it if the battery is under 75% or you'll be sorry, the battery will start dropping 1% every second until the device turns itself off!  Unfortunately I can't return it to Amazon as it is past the 30 day window though Samsung is willing to fix it free of charge (since it's still under warranty). I'm amazed at how a device so highly rated can have as many problems as mine did, my first gen iPad is still going strong. Luckily for me, Amazon had a great price on the iPad minis so I just ordered one to replace this paperweight. This apple user has yet to be swayed over to the android side if this is what they are offering. I can't recommend it, save your money and buy an iPad. I gave it two stars for the excellent customer service Samsung has, it's hands down the best compared to Apple which is laughable.\n\nNOTE:  I've attached pictures of my error messages.  Notice the time and battery percentages in each picture. The two pics were taken within a minute of each other yet the battery dropped quite a bit!  As they say, the proof is in the pudding, lol."}

The ear phones that came with the device do not stay in your ears for more than 10 seconds- they keep dropping off. How did those ear pieces pass through QC? Do these people even try these accessories at leas once before a million of these pieces of crap are manufactured and dumped on customers?\n\nI will post a picture of the ear piece when I get a chance."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "I bought this product several months ago, it was my first Samsung product, and I was reluctant to switch from the Apple products. I have had trouble with this product since I got it with the touch screen. Since I was not familiar with Samsung products and I rarely used it and also had it in a protective case the whole time, I thought this was NORMAL!! As time went on, the touch screen would \"freeze\" more and more. I finally broke down and called Amazon and they told me I had to call Samsung, when I did, they had me send it in and told me it was not covered under warranty because they suspected possible water damage.  I tried to explain to them that this has not had any water damage, I was positive of that and that it had been doing this since I got it so whatever is wrong with it had to have happened during shipping or at the factory or whatever. They didn't seem to care, and wanted $199.00 to fix it. Samsung told me that \"just putting it in my purse is enough warmth to cause water damage!!\" even though I live in ALASKA and don't keep it in my purse AND RARELY CARRIED IT IN MY PURSE! It was almost always on my dresser at home.\n So in my experience with a Samsung product, they are so delicate that the Alaska heat from putting it in your purse is too much for it!!!  When i did research on this particular tablet.... it is famous for the screen freezing up!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "Mostly love it, but as someone else posted, the cable to charge the battery is loose at the connection and can't come out too easily and not charge the tablet. Also, it'd be nice to have directions on which SD card is right for my tablet with directions on the proper way to install it. Why not also add a USB slot for using an external hard drive and loading pictures? (Yes, I know tablets aren't the same as a pc, but with today's technology, anything should be possible...) btw, I was NOT happy the way it was shipped. It was placed in a bigger box with two other items and not nearly enough bubble wrap or other protection, it slid around quite easily in all directions. This could damage any electronic divice, and is very careless of whoever sold/shipped it..."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "About 6 weeks ago I started having issues charging the Samsung tablet. A red x appeared over the battery symbol and the tablet appeared to be charging but very slowly. This red x means that the tablet is plugged into a computer and exchanging data but in reality it was plugged into the Samsung AC wall charger using their cable.\n\nI tried another Micro USB charging cable and it worked fine but not every time. I was worried that the charging port on the tablet was going bad. I take excellent care of my smart devices and I wanted to find out what the issue was. I contacted Samsung support using the on line message support system. It took about an hour to convince Samsung that the cable was bad and perhaps the AC wall charger.\n\nThey shipped me a new AC wall charger and the cable. I tried only the cable by itself first and it has worked perfectly every time I haved plugged it in for three weeks. I wanted to post this update in case any other user of this tablet is having a similar problem. Good luck with Samsung support as the person I dealt with was stubborn about recognizing that one of their products was defective.\n\n---------------------\n\nI own a lot of different tablets but this is my first Samsung and let me say that I am impressed. I went to the store to buy a 7 inch unit but quickly decided to upgrade to the 8 inch version. There were several features that I was concerned about and the 8 inch unit just fit my needs better.\n\n* Larger screen size for reading\n* More basic internal memory at 16 GIG versus 8 GIG for the 7 inch unit\n* The ability to upgrade to a 64 GIG SD card instead of just 32 GIG - note: It actually will use a 128 GIG SD card. I used a Sandisk Class 10 card at 128 GIG. It is great for storage, books, apps, music and videos.\n\nJust remember that in my experience your need for more memory grows as you use your tablet more and if you buy a smaller memory upgrade capability you may regret it. The price difference on launch day was only $40 more. I already own 8 tablets in my family so my experience has proven this need for more memory. As you add more books and more apps the memory slowly gets eaten up. I went ahead and also purchased a Samsung 64 GIG Micro SD memory card and I got a Class 10 Pro series at a cost of $55. It reads at 70 MB/s and a write speed of 20 MB/s. For under $300 you will have a powerful tablet that has more memory (80 GIG) than a 64 GIG iPad Mini for a much lower price.\n\nHere is the link to the Samsung Memory that I purchased:\n\nSamsung 64GB MicroSD XC Pro Class 10 UHS-1 Read Speed 70mb/s Write Speed 20mb/s MB-MGCGB Ultra Fast Speed Memory Card with SoCal Trade, Inc. Memory Card Reader\n\nSome other key features are:\n\n* A powerful Qualcomm quad core CPU operating at 1.2 GHZ ( You can see the speed in using the tablet)\n* 1280 by 800 pixel display\n* A 3 MP rear facing camera\n* A 1.3 MP front facing camera\n* It weighs in at 11  ounces per my scales\n* Bluetooth 4.0\n* Internal 16 GIG of flash memory and it goes to 80 GIG using a 64 GIG Micro SD card (Use a high quality Class 10 Micro SD card)\n* 1.5 GIG of internal RAM\n* A 4450 mAh internal battery pack\n* Android 4.4 operating system Kit Kat\n* 1080P playback and recording\n* A built in IR blaster to control your TV and other infra-red devices and an App called WatchON the help you control your TV and see what is playing on your cable service.\n* The tablet comes with a 31 inch charging and data cable that is a Micro USB on one end and a USB on the other.\n* It comes with an AC wall charger that outputs 5 VDC at 1 Amp and it will operate on 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 HZ.\n* It features a power multitasking function that lets you see and use two apps simultaneously which is something that an Apple iPad cannot do. Very nice feature!\n* You can set up multiple users and limit the apps that they can see and use.\n* You can set up a child friendly and protected user interface.\n* You get $300 worth of free content\n\nI found this tablet to be extremely versatile and very fast. The quad core processor is very impressive and browsing the internet was fast and easy. Adding my Gmail account to the tablet literally took a minute. I put together a video to show you the locations for the controls and what the tablet looks like. It is a bit long and I couldn't even talk about all of the items that I wanted to include. I apologize for the length of the video but I get excited over good technology. Overall the tablet is impressive and it is well worth the money based on the quality and performance that I have seen. I rate it as a 5 star item.\n\nYou can register your device with Samsung Galaxy Perks and get more free items:\n\n* A $10 credit on the Google Play Store\n* 3 months free of Hulu plus\n* 1 year free of Boingo WIFI\n* 50 GIG of free Drop Box cloud storage for 2 years\n* Sirius 3 months free\n* 3 free audible books for new members\n* 3 digital magazines free on Zinio for 2 months\n* A free Polaris Office\n\nUpdate May 2, 2014:\n\nLast night I installed the Amazon AppStore and the Amazon Kindle reading app. I down loaded over 950 books and I was blown away by the speed of the downloads. The CPU and strong WIFI connection really shines with its speed. I was using a strong 2.4 GHz WIFI and I downloaded the speedtest app from Google Play and I could download data at 13.36 Mbps and upload data at 2.09 Mbps. Since I am on ATT Uverse that is a reasonable result. The tablet can use either a 2.4 GHz or a 5 GHz WIFI channel. On the 5GHz frequency I got 17.71 Mbps download and 2.24 Mbps upload.\n\nI used the Amazon AppStore as I own over 1000 apps and it was fast and easy to download many of them. I could transfer them to the SD card to conserve my internal memory. I had to do this manually on some of the apps and others went to the SD card automatically.\n\nThe sound of the speaker is pretty loud for its size. I paired the tablet with a Bluetooth speaker and the process is fast and easy. I use Bluetooth a lot and I was glad to see it work so well and Bluetooth 4.0 is the low power version to help reduce battery consumption.\n\nOver three hours of continuous work the battery dropped from 98% to 62% which is pretty good considering I downloaded over 950 books and 35 apps. I love the fact that I can use my Amazon books and apps so easily and still have access to the Google Play Store to download utilities and apps that are not available on Amazon. It is like having the best of both worlds.\n\nPhotographs are easy to take and edit. I even shot some videos. I wanted to include some in my online video but there was not enough space and time remaining to do so.\n\nUsing an app called Hangouts I was able to do face to face video calls and text messaging with my wife using our gmail account emails. The quality was as good as Facetime and the connection worked very well. I had to install the app Hangouts on my wife's iPhone 5S and the app is free on iTunes. The app was already installed on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4.\n\nI continue to be impressed with the performance and capability of this tablet.\n\nI did want to add that the case is slippery and a little wide to hold so I suggest that you get a case to improve your ability to grip the tablet and hold it."}

I had a Tab 3 that had problems but figured I'd try out the 4 thinking it would be better and apparently I was wrong. The size is great, it's sturdy (when it falls it doesn't crack), the resolution is good and the system itself is pretty good. The battery is horrendous, I have a Galaxy S5 which I use just as much and my tablet will be on 10% in about an hour while my phone is still on around 80% at minimum. There is constantly an issue with the charging port as well, either the charger itself is going (they don't last long at all, they're constantly breaking) or something inside the port itself breaks, which is the issue I had with the Tab 3. Right now I'm having the issue where I plug the tablet in and even though it's plugged in and charging, the tablet shuts off anyway and dies.\nAll in all, I don't feel like it's worth the money. Might have to go to an iPad the next time, makes me wonder if they're so expensive because they work better."}

Primary use: Android games and streaming video.\n\nPros: Screen size, 7\" to 10.1\" is a big jump in viewing quality. Display quality is very good for videos and games. Much faster load times than both of my 7\" tablets. Just as a note, both of my 7\" tablets are very good at these tasks also.\n\nCons: Bottom mounted power cord connection. Interferes with most cases if you want to use the tablet and connect to the power source. Both 7\" tablets have power connection on short side of case.\n  Supplied with a unbranded power supply and a super short cable. Power supply gets very hot (when using tablet) and the cord was much shorter than those supplied with my 7\" tablets. I have replaced power supply with a iclever 2.1A.(does not get hot)."}

It takes good pictures and the speakers are great to this thing. The software is up to date on mine and I have no problems. It runs great and looks great. The weight on this thing is also good . One thing though that was different was that the return button and recently opened apps button are not LED back lit. It is a bit of a downer for when you use it at night, but I'll live. It is easy to find them anyhow since the Home button is now a physical button. The Home button is very easy to press and is not hard like those of iPads. It is all in all a great buy.

The only better points between this samsung and my kindle is size and ability to expand memory, plus apps from the Google play store.  Both are 16 gig, HD,  my kindle has a little better sound. I can't get the sd card to stay mounted so I can use it. There is too much bloatware running.  I installed the exact sane apps on this galaxy as I have on my Kindle and it eats up more memory.  My kindle is only using 4gig after 2 1/2 yrs. The samsung is using over 8 gig and I just got it. That is twice the memory. So it's a disappointment as to what I expected. But battery time is really good. I get at least 12 hours to 14 hours between charging. That is one great thing I can say that can be adjusted to save on. I like the voice search. I find things faster with that, instead of wasting time typing and distracting myself on other things then forgetting what I was looking up.  So I have to to take the good with the bad.  The camera is the same as kindle as far as quality but my kindle only has one camera, this has two which is good. It takes nice pictures."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "Updated review (August 9, 2015)  I love this tablet so much that I now own TWO Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10.1 tablets (first one I purchased I keep in my bedroom and use it daily instead of my bulky laptop)! The first one has Lollipop from a late June, 2015 OTA Update. Regarding my second Tab 4 10.1...August 9, 2015, just received my OTA Lollipop, so both tablets have Lollipop!\n\nSecond Tab 4 10.1 (I use this ALL THE TIME in my Kitchen), and it is so peppy with Lollipop, saves some on battery and the Lollipop is much improved over KitKat. If you buy the Tab 4 10.1, it may take you a few days for you to receive Lollipop. Go to Settings, General tab, About device, Updates, press auto update, and then update and it will check to see if your uodate is ready, be sure you want it because when you update, no going back...the uodate takes about 40 minutes to complete and you need at least 75 percent battery or higher.\n\nPROS/SPECIAL FEATURES I FOUND WHILE TESTING THIS TABLET:\n\n+ Size - This Tab 4 10.1 is perfect watching videos, pictures and movies. What I do to carry it around is to place it in a large backpack or in a large tote purse. **The advantage is that now I do not have to carry my laptop with me when I travel anymore. I purchased a small and portable Bluetooth keyboard so I can type easilythis also fits into my backpack for travel. Saves weight and I type just like I am on my laptop at home.\n\n+ Lollipop Update and More The tablet I find is quite responsive and peppy with no lagging. The Lollipop runs this tablet wonderfullyYes, I updated this to Lollipop in June, 2015 (it came with KitKat). Since the update, it runs smoother with no lagging whatsoever. I made sure that I updated ALL my personal apps BEFORE I updated so they are Lollipop ready!\nAbout updating to Lollipop: Be sure you want to do this as once you update, you cannot go back to KitKat. Also, for best results before you update the OS (I found this to be true), be sure to update your Apps from the Playstore to the newest updates. This is so your apps will be Lollipop ready and they will work well. And also be sure that your battery has at least 75 to 80 percent of battery left as the update will take about 45 or more minutes to complete and then your tablet will need to restart and reset the apps etc.\n\n+  Clear and Vivid Screen Resolution, Brightness and Other Info  It is true that this is the highest resolution, yet in my opinion, I find the colors vivid, pictures and text sharp! Watching videos and movies on this I find very clear\n\n+ Battery life/Speed  Very good battery life! For me, I have found that I am constantly on WiFi (Internet). However, I also find that this tablet gets me at least 1 to 2 hours MORE daily than my older Tab 3 10.1 did!\n\n+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi and MORE -  This tablet connects SUPER quickly to my home WiFi and has never ever dropped the WiFi signal no matter where I am in my home. WiFi is VERY STRONG using this device, even when I am very far from my router I still have 4.5 bars! *** To test the speed and strength of this WiFi and compare it to my other Android devices, I went to the Playstore and got the free app called WiFi Analyzer. This is a MUST HAVE app for any Android device as it gives you a visual report on the WiFi strength of your tablet, phone etc.\n\n+ SPECIAL INFO about INTERNET CONNECTION - Yes, this is a WiFi only, but when you are away from an WiFi internet hotspot location, there are ways to can get onto the internet such as MiFi and there are ways that you can purchase equipment so that you can have data when you do not have a WiFi hotspot available.\n\n+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The stock browser does a wonderful job and it opens up webpages very fast. Also I tried Maxthon Browser and this worked very well yet I still prefer the Internet App. Also, I tried out the factory installed Chrome Browser and liked it OK, yet again, I went back the the stock Internet App (this is my preference). Note that the Playstore has many very good (FREE) internet browsers as Dolphin, Opera and many more!\n\n+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD. This is a must for me as I keep my personal files, photos, and music on my internal SD card. I installed a SanDisk 32GB SD card and it works great on this tablet and I placed my music and files on it and have plenty of space left.\n\n+ Camera / Video Camera  OK camera for a tabletI took this out on a trip and videoed and took some pictures inside and outside. Inside videos and pictures had good lighting and the pictures were quite clear! I am amazed because I forgot to bring my regular digital camera and I was very pleased with the videos and the still pictures. Hint: This tablet has NO FLASH so be sure that inside and outside shots have adequate lighting. Outdoors be sure to take a picture where there is NO GLARE. I took my time and did that and believe it or not, these pictures were some of the BEST ones that I ever took as I held the tablet firm (no shaking) and the colors and sharpness were wonderful However, I found that I use my digital camera for serious picture taking.\n\n+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried).\n\n+ Music Player/Sound Quality - This model has the regular MUSIC App, which plays by playlists, songs, albums and even folders. Also there is Google Music app is pre-installed in this tablet and does a fine job. However, I installed the FREE app called Rocket Player from the Playstore and love this music player! As for sound quality - The best way to really enjoy music is through a high quality Bluetooth speaker or Bluetooth headset as the sound quality is superb this way and you can walk about your home listening to your music!\n\n+ OTG USB Compatible (On the Go USB Micro Adapter) - You will need to purchase a OTG (On the Go) Micro USB adapter (Amazon sells them and the cost is under 20 dollars in most cases, just type in OTG Micro Adapter in the search-box for a list of them). This will allow you to plug in your mouse, Flash Drive to the adapter on the large end and plug the small Micro end into the USB port on the Samsung tablet. Then you just plug in your flash drive and you can copy files to the flash drive so easily or view files that are on the flash drive. *Note that portable external hard drives and portable DVD/CD drives will not work using OTG in this tablet because they require a lot of power.\n\n--- ONE MINOR CON - The USB charging port is located at the bottom of the tablet. What this means is that when I want to keep charging the tablet and use it as well and place it on my tablet stand I bought, it will not work right side up in LANDSCAPE MODE.\nHowever, there is a perfect fix for this: I simply place the tablet in LANDSCAPE UPSIDE DOWN with the USB Port ON TOP and then I place it into the stand for table top viewing! This is possible because of the auto rotation!\nAlso, my MoKo cover/case has a hole for the USB port so I keep it in this and can charge it overnight when the stand is closed. But in this stand, to keep the tablet in the stand to view it, I have to take the USB charger cable out while I am viewing this say in a coffee shop, hotel etc.\nI rate this 4.9 stars rounded off to 5 stars because of this minor con.\n\nBottom line- Would I buy this tablet all over again? Yes, and I liked it so much that I bought a second one to keep on my Kitchen Island area to use to read my recipes, check weather, music and more! This is still my favorite tablet!"}

The seal was broken on the box, so I was a bit leery when I received it. However, it was in new condition. The odd part was that it was a french version, with not even an English translation for start up documentation, but the steps were fairly intuitive. It also came with a round plug (French) charger with a US adapter and some preloaded French apps. A bit odd, but it works great. Pages load very quickly, screen quality is great, love the portability. I'm using it more than anticipated and am very happy with the purchase."}

I thought getting $300 in perks was a nice selling point until I tried to get my perks.  I have been emailing Samsung and getting directions to obtaining the perks that did not work for almost a month.  Ive been calling them for 3 days now and still waiting.  I've been transfered and talked with 4 or 5 different departments, all nice people though.  And just today I was told they would try to send the Perks to me manually in 2-3 business days; not good news since this is Friday.  Yawn!  I have to say calling Samsung is a really nice experience though.  They all speak USA English, and they answer the phone fast once you get past the few simple automated questions.  They is no complaint with the people at Customer Service; its Samsung's system that needs improving.  I just wish Samsung would send me my perks.  Free perks are always nice...they are expecially better if you get them.  We'll see what next week brings...........\n\nIt is a great table for the money and has even dropped $20 since i ordered mine 4 weeks ago.  I just wish my perk experience was a little better."}

Not an easy process (likely on purpose).  First you need to call 1-800-SAMSUNG.  Give them your model # and Serial #.  They you need to call the service ctr. after you get a Case #.  However, when you call the Service Ctr. - NO ONE answers.  I waited on hold for over 10 min and didn't get a live person (nor a message saying your wait time is...).  Guess I will have to try again.  Ridiculous process.\n\nJune, 2015:  Worked fine for about 5 mos...now issues was initially purchased as a replacement to iPad for xmas for my husband as he was having issues with the iPad.  SGT4 worked great until about 1 mo. ago he started complaining that the screen just randomly goes black on him while typing, reading, searching, etc.  Been searching web for possible solutions, seems like common Samsung issue though.

The picture quality is good, but I probably would use my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 to take pictures.  It was rather difficult to set up, I had to call for tech support to get all the stuff transferred from my phone to my tablet 4.  It took me 4 hrs, and it wouldn't work, but after calling tech support I found about  the Samsung link that helps with transferring the information over.  I was told when I purchased my phone it would ez, because the phone talks well with that tablet; I don't agree much with that statement.  The phone has a device that says it will pair with any Samsung table just by touching them together, that was a joke.  But anywho, I got them to talk to each other; and now it's up and running.  Now I just to find a way to get my Fitbit to work with my Tablet 4, and some other items as well that use USB to talk to my old Notebook.

It became slower and slower over time and then finally very problematic. As I have now learned, the problems I have had are quite common and not easily fixed. The tablet started having errors, pop-up error messages, stating, to name a few, Unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped working, Unfortunately, internet has stopped working, Unfortunately, google.apps...  has stopped working, etc. Unfortunately is right! Especially when I received so many of these error pop-ups that I couldn't clear them fast enough to actually use the tablet. After a few days of this happening consistently, the damned tablet started loading up and then powered itself off. It wouldn't stay off though. It would constantly restart, load up again then power off again. Sometimes it would boot-loop and I would have to hard reset it to get it to stay off. That worked to keep it powered off for only a short time before that quit working. I had to let it run itself out of battery power just to shut it down. Followed some tech advice I found after searching the net and thought maybe I could finally use the tablet again but NO! After doing a factory reset and wiping the tablet clean, which you'd think would resolve the error issues, I not only lost all my data and it took an act of God to get it to factory wipe but when it booted up I couldn't get past the friggin' START screen because of all of the same error pop-ups again. Better known as BRICKED. Ugh!\n\nSpend the extra money on a Tab Pro or a Note and save yourself the frustration and stress of having to deal with this Piece of Sh*t. Samsung Customer Service is a joke. 30 day warranty? Think about it. Most electronics work well for that long. Problems usually occur after the first month and if they do, and they will, you're screwed. To pay to have Samsung look at it or the $75 I was quoted to have a local geek service it really isn't worth doing. It makes more sense at this point to spend the money on a higher quality tablet then take a chance on spending the money to have it serviced, hoping it can be fixed mind you, and then dealing with more issues down the road. Do a Google search on the Galaxy Tab 4 10.1 repair and see for yourself how many folks have had issues. The Galaxy Tab 4 10.1 is well known for a myriad of problems.\n\nI hope this review saves others from wasting money on a tablet that won't last  but will surely cause many headaches and a f*ck ton of stress."}

The Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 (10-1-inch,Black) is a very good tablet. The screen is big and clear. Perfect for reading books or watching movies. If you have a Samsung smart phone than you will have no problem using this tablet. The only thing this tablet doesn't do is make and answer phone calls. The tablet is lightweight so it's easy to carry in a large purse or bag. This tablet even has a kid's page and it has parental controls so that's a big plus if you have kids.\nIf you don't like to swipe you can buy a keyboard case logitech makes a good on it sales for $99.99 on amazon but they do have cheaper models that are not as expensive."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "When I got this tablet it was on sale on Amazon for $270 and it is well worth the price you have tablets that don't even come close and sell for about the same as this tablet. I have only found one issue that I have with this tablet and that is the storage. I am very computer/tablet literate and have no problems with any other devices that I have but with this particular tablet if I move something to my sd card it still shows up in my files on my tablet and then if I delete it from the tablet it mysteriously gets deleted from the SD card too. I have tried everything from specifically naming folders on the SD card and manually transferring them over there and still for some reason if it is on the tablet and I delete them they disappear from my sd card as well (and vice versa if its on my SD card and I delete it from that it deletes it from my tablet as well). I'm sure there might be a simple solution to this and I'll figure it but for right now the file storage between the tablet and the SD card is a little murky so just to be safe make sure you back up any important files on a second device.  I would definitely still recommend this tablet it has too many great perks for that one issue to bring it down. I would also just like to mention to all of those readers out there as much as I love my Kindle I have to admit that with this tablet the Kindle app actually makes reading better than the actual Kindle device so if you're a reader you would probably really enjoy the size of the screen and the functionality of the Kindle Reading App and other reading apps if use them because I also use cool reader  it is really just a very good tablet for reading on."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "Let me start by saying,  I did not purchased my tablet from Amazon; it was a birthday gift. My husband purchased it from Sam's Club.  I paid $30 more, because I wanted it the  same day.  That's how eager I was to have this tablet. However,  I do love this tablet.  I have a Note 3 (phone) and it looks exactly like my phone but much larger.  NOTE: it does not have a S Pen. However, it does almost  everything my phone does, but I must say the camera suck on this tablet. I wish there was a better camera on this tablet. I'm also finding that there are a few apps that are not compatible with my device.  Overall,  I do use my tablet more than my phone.  I can send text messages, and make calls using my tablet,  my Bluetooth,  and an app called Mighty Text (which is found in Google Play Market). With that being said,  I pretty much use my tablet all day.  The downside,  it takes several hours to fully charge, meaning it charges slowly.  4 to 5 hours give or take,  for a full charge. Even though it is still functional while it's charging, the time factor can be still be annoying. Also the charger cord included,  is very short. So I ended up purchasing a longer cord. I've noticed that few people have complained about the battery life,  I can't say anything negative. I use mine all day,  without it dying,  if I charge it the night before.  I also allow my battery to cycle; by allowing it to die completely before recharging. Then allowing it to recharge fully, before using.  This helps extend your battery life, and allows your device to check for updates."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "I think it's perfect in every way a tablet is designed to be and love it. I gave it a 4, when it might have needed a 5, because I am a bit disappointed in how some of the apps work, but I think that's simply because it's a tablet. FB does not have the full capacities it does on my computer, for example. But I know that's an app issue, not a Galaxy issue. Also, figuring out how the photo management works is a bit tricky. I'm sure I'll get it eventually, but I was hoping I might be able to replace my laptop with it, eventually. I love the games I have downloaded on it and use it more for them than anything else, though I do occasionally take a pic with it, when I need to. I've inadvertently deleted some that mattered though, so don't depend on it. I love listening to Pandora on it and love the bluetooth feature. So, for me, I mainly use it for music and games. I don't like the fact that I have to \"turn it back on\" with the button when it goes into sleep. I would rather just have to touch the screen. I did go on and buy the more expensive Otter casing to protect it, which I am glad I did. Just sorry I felt the need to. That was an additional $60, so it can get really pricey."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "I have had the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 since end of February now and still do not like it any better than when I first got it.  Sure wished I had returned it before the 30 days were up.  However during that time I underwent intensive back surgery and it sort of knocked me down for awhile.  In fact that is why I finally went ahead and ordered the Tablet since my wife and kids had put the money in my Amazon account months ago (Christmas and birthday end of Nov.) for me to use.  Thought it would be good to have this Tablet while I was in the hospital and not have to carry our large laptop.\nIt is just NOT as easy to navigate with the Tablet to sites like is is on a regular computer.  For instance I wanted to look up something on WebMd and for each subject you'd like to look up you have to use a totally different App whereas on a computer you have it all on WebMD's homepage at your fingertips.  Guess I'll give this Tablet to our Grandchildren and get myself the smaller screen laptop like I should have gotten in the first place.  But have learned a variable lesson in not ordering things such as this from online but going to a local store and then I can return the item much easier and time would not run out on me.\nMaybe some of you oldsters out there are more savvy than me (age 72) but normally I pick up on new electronic devices easier than this Galaxy 4 10.1 Tablet has been.  But then even what I have learned to do on it just do not like it's layout at all.\nNow I am STUCK with it."}

I just found that to be very primitive. I've had it for less than 24 hours so i hope I find some other redeeming qualities. I have a feeling this would not be the case with the IBM tablet. It seems that this tablet is okay if you want a toy but if you want to do anything more serious you need to look at something else."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "I bought the Galaxy Tab as my old iPad was getting \"full\" and the cost of obtaining one of larger capacity was almost double what I spent for the Samsung.  The tablet, and a 64 gig memory card both were right around half the price of a 64 gig iPad.\n\nI'm very pleased with the Samsung.  The screen resolution is not as great as the iPad, but it's good enough so that I don't notice for anything I do.\nWiFi connectivity is better than the iPad; I use it at work at a major university while I'm in my patrol car, and I can get more hot-spots than ever I could with the iPad.\nAll the same apps I had for the iPad seem to be available for Android and work just as well.  I put Kindle on it and can't tell the difference between the two devices.\n\nOnly a couple of very minor complaints...  The volume control on the edge is very small and hard to feel properly.  The widescreen display means that some sites (notoriously TV guide) won't show quite right... You only get two hours of the \"grid\" instead of three...\n\nThere are not quite the number of high quality apps in some areas.  For instance, I have an iRig and a guitar-amp emulator on the iPad, and no such device is yet available for Android.  (that I'm aware of)\nAlso, the charging mini-usb port is VERY mini.  Dunno why they didn't use the bigger one.\n\nAll in all, a bargain."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "For years, I have owned Samsung Tablets and phones and love the quality and features. This is my favorite Samsung tablet yet! So far I have had a truly WOW experience using this tablet as it has exceeded my expectations! Below are the Pros and the Cons of this tablet...In late July, 2015, the tablet updated to Lollipop and it saves me battery, love this update.\n\nPROS/SPECIAL FEATURES:\n\n+ Screen Resolution/Weight/Size etc - The first thing I noticed is that this tablet has 149 PPI-Pixels----however, what I discovered is that the screen is very, very clear and the colors are spectacular! The screen is absolutely beautiful! RESULT for me: It is that much clearer and vivid screen than I thought it would be with truly amazing clarity!\n**Brightness of the screen: I compared this with my older ASUS MeMopad and found that this screen is MUCH BRIGHTER! (I like a bright and vivid screen and this tablet has just what I was searching for in a screen).\n\n+ Clarity of the screen for reading - It is very easy to read Kindle books and eBooks on this tablet. And I place the tablet inside my case/stand and read in landscape, it is very easy to read on it this way. The tablet just sits in my lap for easy reading.\n\n+ Weight - Lighter than I thought!  For a 10.1 tablet, I found it easy to hold and use.  *Also, I purchased on Amazon a JETech Slim Fit Case and it is an excellent stand/cover and protects the tablet yet lightweight.\n\n+ Speed of this unit / Memory etc - This tablet has adequate memory and I found it enough to keep the tablet running at a good speed. And I found that the tablet runs plenty fast with no lagging.\n\n+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi and MORE - This tablet connects very quickly to my home WiFi and has never ever dropped the WIFi signal no matter where I am in my home. WiFi is VERY STRONG using this device, even when I am very far from my router I still have 4.5 bars! *** To test the speed and strength of this WiFi and compare it to my other Android devices, I went to the Playstore and got the free app called WiFi Analyzer. This is a MUST HAVE app for any Android device as it gives you a visual report on the WiFi strength of your tablet, phone etc.\n\n+ SPECIAL INFO about INTERNET CONNECTION - Yes, this is a WiFi only, but when you are away from an WiFi internet hotspot location, there are ways to can get onto the internet such as MiFi and there are ways that you can purchase equipment so that you can have data when you do not have a WiFi hotspot available.\n\n+ Internet & Webpage & Video Viewing - The stock browser does a wonderful job and it opens up webpages very fast. Also I tried Maxthon Browser and this worked very well yet I still prefer the Internet App. Also, I tried out the factory installed Chrome Browser and liked it OK, yet again, I went back the the stock Internet App (this is my preference). Note that the Playstore has many very good (FREE) internet browsers as Dolphin, Opera and many more!\n\n+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD up to 64GB This is a must for me as I keep my personal files, photos, and music on my internal SD card. Note that this was one of the deciding factors that sold me on this tablet. I installed a SanDisk 32GB SD card and it works great on this tablet.\n\n- Camera / Video Camera - The camera is now 3.5 MP which I found took OK pictures, but since it does not have a flash on it, I had to be in very bright lighting. For me, I found that I use my digital camera for serious picture taking. Videos were somewhat grainy on this tablet. (The camera and Video camera are not that great in this tablet)! I rarely use this camera as I prefer to use my Nikon digital camera for my overall picture takingthe camera on this tablet is OK for backup camera, taking pictures to send in an email, etc). Do not expect the camera on this tablet to replace your digital camera.\n\n+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player (Free App from Playstore and the ONLY one I recommend as it plays every home video I tried).\n\n+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: This comes with a So So Office app (viewer) for reading Office documents, however, I STILL prefer Kingsoft Office which is a free app from Playstore. It is the best I have ever tried and I am very picky about so called Office programs. It is very compatible with MS Office as it reads, edits and creates Office files and reads PDF files, and it has more features of any other Android Office program that I tried. This app is a MUST have for tablet owners in my opinion.\n\n+ Music Player/Sound Quality  This model has the regular MUSIC App, which plays by playlists, songs, albums and even folders. Also there is Google Music app is pre-installed in this tablet and does a fine job. However, I installed the FREE app called Rocket Player from the Playstore and love this music player! As for sound quality - The best way to really enjoy music is through a high quality Bluetooth speaker or Bluetooth headset as the sound quality is superb this way and you can walk about your home listening to your music!\n\n+ Battery Life- Very good to excellent. Since I have done a few tweaks on this tablet, now I have found that my battery life is better than the first and even the second day. In fact, the battery life now I find that when I use WiFi just when I need it, I now get about 7 to 8 hours with it(this reflects 100 percent brightness however).\n\n***Where battery life is concerned: To make your battery last as long as possible is to be sure to turn off BLUETOOTH AND WIFI when you do not need these. Both are these are memory hogs! Also, I turn off my GPS and even SYNC sometimes to conserve battery and then turn them on later.\n\n+ OTG USB Compatible - This tablet comes with a free OTG On the Go adapter cable. Just plug in your flash drive and you can copy files to the flash drive so easily or view files that are on the flash drive. *Note that portable external hard drives and portable DVD/CD drives will not work using OTG in this tablet because they require a lot of power.\n\n- No support for Flash Videos - Adobe does not support flash in any Android tablets this days. This non support is for all Android tablets, not just Samsung tablets. + Watching Flash Videos - This device does not come with installed flash, however, I found a workaround to solve this. So if you request it in the comments, I will send you instructions on how to installed Archived Flash so you can watch flash videos and what proper browsers I recommend for this tablet...The only browser that I could get the Archived Flash to play on and well was Puffin Browser for 2.99 in the Playstore. (I tried Maxthon, FoxFire Beta and more and this was the only one that played consistently flash videos).\n**Here is what I do to watch videos: I use free Playstore apps as YouTube, Netflix, CBS.COM and more and open up the app instead of going to the browser to watch videos that I want to. They play fine in an APP rather than in a Browser.\n\n- No installed Adobe Flash (This can be fixed by installing an Archived Adobe Flash from Adobe website. And I did so and now I can watch flash videos using Puffin Paid browser. (No new Android tablets or phones come with flash, but the Archived Adobe Flash can be installed). Most flash videos play OK with this older Archived Flash, with the exception of Amazon videos (as of March 30, 2014).\n-\n- Would I purchase this tablet again? YES! In a heartbeat because it is a low cost yet feature packed tablet. And I recommend this to anyone buying their first tablet - this tablet is reasonable in cost, yet it is a really great tablet!\nMy true star rating is 4.6 stars as I find that this tablet, for the most part, has exceeded my expectations. I did take a small amount of the stars off because sometimes the temperature rises a bit when I install several apps, play games, etc.\n\nIf you have questions about this tablet, I will be happy to answer any questions you may have through the comment section."}

Not only does it give her some games to play but coupled with a Bluetooth keyboard she has found it works very well for her email and web browsing. The only con is the amount of bloatware that is on the device with no real way to delete it. However this problem is not confined to the Galaxy Tab and unfortunately is common across the industry."}

It's a big improvement and not just in size, but it come with a lot of pre-installed bloatware that you can't unintall unless you root it. I was hoping not to root this one for a while. The Tab 2 didn't work as well with a custom rom as the stock rom."}

Tablets I've tries: non-Samsung Android, M$ Surface, & iPad.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 actually works well but... Tech Support SUCKS! Otherwise I would give it 4/5 Stars.\n\nBe warned the editing app for Gallery is missing & you will have to download it.\n\nBut shortly after buying this the NEW Android OS came out so all is now OUTDATED! I notice that some Apps are not working well after UPDATES probably because they're now for the NEW Android OS.\n\nDo not delete Kindle Reader because you will NEVER get it back & Tech Support doesn't have a clue. But the FREE BOOK every month deal probably won't work anymore either.\n\nLast Samsung Netbook Ihad was HORRIBLE mostly because of M$ Vista. Tech Support was HORRID then as well. I swore I'd NEVER buy Samsung again but after 5 worse Tablets I came to tolerate Samsung again.\n\nLike I said: TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE! But what Tech Support works anymore with any product?\n\nFYI: posted a nicer review on Samsung's site & THEY deleted it! All because I mentioned how bad Tech Support was."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "Tablet experiences thus far(just to lay groundwork for my opinion):\n\nAsus tf700 -  Beautiful screen,nice keyboard,great looking product. Had it for over a yr. Unpredictable. Never knew what it would do from one day to the next. To much work to maintain. Clear out the memory w/cold reboot weekly,shut down background apps to conserve operating memory,check device forum for solution to latest problem(which everyone with the tablet seems to be having,by the way). Beautiful screen resolution, just way too much work. NO MORE ASUS PRODUCTS.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab 2 7\" - Actually, not a bad tablet. Bought it used as a platform for my 2nd coc acct. Screen resolution wasn't that great but it worked. All the time. No glitches. No problems. Still works. Just doesn't look great beside newer tablets.\n\nGalaxy Tab 3  8.0 - Refurbished. Have had it for 4 mos. This could be the perfect size for the casual user. High ppi for this size tabet. Excellent screen resolution. No glitches. It just works without major issues. The battery usage is high. Stick the \"Active applications\" widget on the home page to cut off background apps. It will give you more battery life. A good deal so far.\n\nLenovo a8 8\" - Solid performer, looks good, strange page setup. Had to install nova launcher to make sense of the layout. Very affordable. Not so great screen resolution. A deal breaker on this one.\n\nSo....sold the Asus tf700, the Lenovo a8 and some other stuff thru amazon and bought the Galaxy Tab 4. Pleasantly surprised. A descent screen resolution that looks sharp with everything. Doesn't look as good with CoC as the 8 inch tab 3 but not a deal breaker( more ppi on the 8 inch). I am satisfied with the screen and the tab performance thus far. I am enjoying the larger size. My wife has the Tab S. Exceptional screen res. No operating memory and gets warm. Fast. For my purposes, the Tab 4 10.1 is not perfect, but pretty darn close. No operating issues thus far. Smooth and steady. Turn it on and it works. That's more important for me than a beautiful screen and 100.00 to 200.00 more cost."}

I figured that we might have gotten a lemon. I contacted Amazon and despite me having bought it at a lower price they were able to accommodate me and send me a new one while I went about sending in the old one. No complaints on the new one so far. He loves it and I also like it much better than my Ipad 3 in terms of weight and portability. He was able to sync all his information from his S5 to the tablet seamlessly. I would definitely recommend this tablet as well as purchasing it on Amazon for the top notch customer service we received."}

The unit has yet to crash or reboot itself. And it has a decent battery life. I only have to charge one or twice per week even if I leave it on all the time.\n\nTHE ONE CON:  --  (This more aimed at the bone heads at Google, the authors of the android system, rather than Samsung.)\nWhy can't I write to my micro-SD card while its mounted in the tablet? This makes this a pain in the neck when it comes to storing my music files and pdf book on the sd-card. I have to take it out of the tablet, mount it with my desk top computer -- Debian Linux -- and then re-insert it back into the tablet. Could you please fix this. What you are doing now is more of a 'band-aid'. Also why won't android recognize sd-cards formatted in the ext2 file system? (ext2 is the standard Linux file system) Android is based on Linux isn't it?\n\nSamsung make an excellent tablet.

Either the developer community completely looked this one over, or the various browsers available (Firefox, Chrome and Samsung's own) are just freakin' terrible. No feedback when loading pages, alignments constantly shifting while trying to select links - often leading you to the wrong link over and over and no backlit hard keys (the \"back\" and \"home\" keys to either side of the main button) make this a real pain in the you know what to use.\n\nDecent for games, but  basically unuseable for anything resembling web browsing.

My only real gripe is that the home button and icons at the bottom are not lighted, which can be frustrating when using in the dark. The display is bright and clear, but not as vivid as my Galaxy S4 phone. This Tab is thin and nicely finished (one review said the metal trim looked cheap. I think it looks nice).

The screen is very bright and crisp which I was not expecting because of the cost, but am very impressed. For basic internet browsing/ social media and videos etc.. this is an excellent tablet. Totally worth the 229$.."}

Seriously, it does all sorts of interesting things, most of which my children haven't explained yet, but the learning curve hasn't been too bad. For the most part, the controls are simple and intuitive. I added a cheap memory card--64gb--so there's a ton of carrying capacity for docs, music, pictures, video.  I really like the solid feel of the device--it has a nice heft to it, without being heavy.  Sold. Right. It worked perfectly right out of the box, and continues to do so.  Plus, I got this baby from Amazon for about $220 bucks new, on a black friday deal--so it packs a lot of bang for that buck.  I'd buy it again, and I'd recommend it to others."}

The first couple of days it worked like a charm, but after that, we can't get it to do anything.  The \"home\" and \"back\" buttons don't work at all.  The only way to maneuver around is to turn it off and wait a few minutes and then try again and hope it works.  Very frustrating.  Unfortunately, I had to take her back to her home which is 3 hours away from me so it is literally impossible for me to help....not that I would know how to anyways."}

When I found the Tab 4 10.1 super cheap on a Black Friday deal, I thought the bigger screen would be a nice upgrade. And there's the problem. It's not an upgrade.  It's my own fault. I should have checked the specs closer.  The bigger screen would be nice, but it's the same resolution as my 8 inch Tab 3. Since it's stretched out on a bigger screen, things are noticeably not as sharp. The camera is only 3MP vs my Tab 3's 5MP.  There are lots of other differences too, but my point is that you should do some comparison shopping first. For the price, this isn't a bad tablet, but it's not great either. If you have a Galaxy S3, 4, or 5 phone, this is going to feel like a big step down from your phone, and I wouldn't recommend it."}

I then had to ship back the replacement because it too stopped working. When the second replacement quit I decided I should go ahead and invest in a Samsung. This was more pricey than the original tablet I purchased but so totally worth every penny. I have had this for a few months now and not had even the smallest glitch. My only issue is the google stuff that pops up randomly on here that I can't shut off but that's not an operational issue. This is a great tablet. The size is ideal and unlike other tablets this size, this is not heavy or bulky. This is a great buy and a great tablet to own. I would recommend purchasing a longer charger cord if you can because the one that comes with it is kind of ridiculously short."}

Never could tell which side was up so I marked the cable and the tablet and it's now easier.\nThe buttons are not very intuitive.  I've used it now for four months and still fumble to find the volume and power button. Because they are the same color as the frame, they are hard to see. Much better if they were a contrasting color.  The back button is invisible if you are in low light.  (why not have it lighted like on Samsung phones??) The home button is a hard button which makes no sense.\nWish there was a HDMI out because screen mirroring is difficult."}

Whenever I try to scroll down while reading it zooms and eventually freezes. Additionally there is some glitch that causes phone numbers not to register on online forms... if I have an online form I either use my partners $109 RCA, that is 2 years old and never had a problem, or my 4yr old kindle. I've spent months trying to fix with Samsung online customer service, multiple times resetting all it did was waste time till the warranty expired so now I'd have to pay 25ph plus parts for hardware fixes. In addition to not helping, their site us designed to be a PITA; I am convinced to get customers so frustrated they give up. I look forward to getting an IPad and smashing this piece of garbage on the curb... I will never buy another Samsung product again. While I am sure the majority get a good product, if you get the dud you are screwed."}

She is more tech savy and even she spent most of a day 'programing' it with all the settings.  Frustrated even her, which is hard to do.  When the subject of a 'tablet' came up (after I ordered it but before it arrived ) she said she couldn't imagine having any use for one.  Oh Great!  But she reads Ebooks and watches Netfliz all the time so I hoped her opinion would change once she got it.  It did!  She won't put it down now. It replaced her Ebook reader for books and her laptop for movies.  And she says checking and answering emails is so muche asier on it.  It's a one does all gadget.  if you can get past the program process it's very multi-funtional."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "PROS:\nFOR FUN: The picture is really sharp when you're playing games, watching Netflix, or perusing YouTube. The sound quality also took me by surprise. The first time I got on Pandora I was worried I blew out the speakers because it blasted so loudly. Thankfully, nope! This little thing just knows how to jam. It has better sound than my laptop with Beats Audio does (no joke). It loads websites and games quickly and I can easily move from program to program. Its light-weight, super easy to use, and the picture and sound quality are impressive.\nFOR SCHOOL: I'm a senior in college, so I spend most of my time at school. Because the tablet is so lightweight and compact, I can carry this thing in my backpack every day without noticing the extra weight. I used to lug around my laptop, but it would make my shoulders ache by hour 2. I also purchased a protective cover with a wireless Bluetooth keyboard. Now, while the professor is lecturing, I can open up the slideshow on my tablet, and make my notes directly onto the slides. It is so easy and has made my note-taking so much faster! Not to mention, I can do research and work on essays in between classes. Productivity WIN!\nI love, love, love this tablet!\nCONS:\nFOR FUN: The cameras seem a little lacking sometimes. When you're taking the picture, everything looks crystal clear (you can see pores galore). When you go back to look at the pictures, though, they seem a little grainy. I'm not sure why this is. It happens with both cameras (there's a camera on the back and a \"selfie\" camera on the front). The pictures are still of very good quality, and maybe I should be happy that my pores don't make an appearance, but the picture you view afterwards is not as sharp as the picture you thought you were taking.\nFOR SCHOOL: I was unaware that Microsoft Office is NOT compatible with this tablet. I somehow missed the fact that Microsoft and Android were competitors. No worries, though! I have a very similar program downloaded. You can easily open up a Microsoft Office document (such as my professor's slideshows) and view/edit them with ease. You can even email the edited version back to your computer and view/edit it again on Microsoft Office. Again, I'm not sure why this is, but as long as I can get my work done with minimal headaches, I don't care.\nOverall, I absolutely love this product! I am very impressed. It was worth every penny and has definitely been a beneficial addition to my life.\nP.S. I got the Samsung Tab 4 because I have a Samsung S4 phone and I love them both! I have friends with the S5 and I really don't see the difference. The same goes for other tablets. In my opinion, the Tab 4 and the S4 are essentially cheaper for the same quality."}

I had purchased her brother a different brand and am now wishing I had purchased him the Samsung Galaxy as well.  I did pay a bit more for this one than I did his but I do believe the price was well worth the investment.  Her tab vs. his tab is a world of difference.  The only drawback to this tab that keeps me from giving it a five star rating is that it does not allow you to sync and because we own a vehicle that has sync capabilities that means she cannot access the wi.fi from the vehicle when we are traveling as my son can with his, and that is a huge drawback on long trips, especially if she has reports to do and needs the internet to research.  I am surprised that Samsung has not thought of this as I own many samsung products and they come with sync... this is the first that has not and I would not have purchased this had I known it did not, however by the time we learned that it didn't we had already fallen in love with so many other aspects of the device that we decided to live with the drawback.... sigh"}

I'm sure we've all been there before where you buy a really nice phone or tablet and 6 months later the manufacturer stops supporting it?!  It's frustrating!  One thing I can say about Samsung is that they do a good job of supporting their products, including legacy devices.  So I purchased a Samsung tablet because I knew it would be supported and scalable. Processor is pretty sharp, I haven't really been able to throw anything at it that it couldn't handle...  I'm sure someone out there might be able too make it lag, but for my use it's been perfect.  I use it for working with documents, Netflix, Youtube, social apps and some minor gaming. The price is the best out there for the hardware and software you get with this tablet."}

It can only be used well in landscape mode and that too with the home button facing downward. In any other orientation it is impossible to use the buttons effectively.  Before this I was used to the Nexus 10 which has software keys for these buttons that will always be at the bottom no matter how you hold the tablet. That was perfect. This one socks."}

But TempleRun2 seems to be ok.\n\nAm I missing some settings ? Do I need to turn on any graphics acceleration ? I could not find anything related to graphics.\n\nOr is it because the \"Plants Vs Zombies 2\" game itself is slow in Galaxy Tab4 family ?\n\nI am amazed by the \"lack of\" Samsung customer support in trying to solve this problem or explaining what is happening with the game and Tab4.\n\nPS: I will give this Galaxy-Tab4-8in to my daughter and keep the Galaxy-Tab4-10in for my use.\n\nFrom now on, I am ordering Asus-2012 or Asus-2013.\n\nThanks,\nKaruna."}

I school my children at home using K12, and I wanted some kind of tablet to take when we went out of town that my kids could do their school work on so I bought a Kindle first. Little did I know that a Kindle does not support the Adobe flash player needed to run the lessons.  If I would have known that I wouldn't have bought a Kindle in the first place.  So I researched it and found a program that runs the lessons (puffin academy) and found that it can be downloaded to any android device,  so that narrowed my search and I automatically went with a Samsung product because I love their products and they are great quality for a lesser price.  I am sold on Samsung products and my next phone will be a Galaxy also."}

Only complaint is that the cable for the charger is whey too short. But that is a minor issue. Great Tablet regardless."}

And the bonus is I got it at the right time. $230. Can't beat that price. Husband loves it. Its super easy to use. Much easier than my Asus transformer but the tab doesn't do as much. We think. Still trying to figure out how to stream it to the TV to watch movies if we can. So far that's a no go. Its lite weight and the back is textured so no worrying about it slipping out of your hands. But these things are expensive so I ordered a wawo case as well. Doesn't make it much heavier. Got the tablet super fast, just a few days after ordering. Although the hug box it came it was a bit much, especially since it barely had any packing in it to stop it from sliding around in said huge box. When I mean huge I mean you could have easily fit 50 brand new, in box, Galaxy tab 4. But I digress. Great tablet. Definite buy. Would totally recommend."}

I was busy to prepare two trips for groups people, need taking this Tab with me for my whole trip, therefor, I was going to  contact Amazon when I come back .\n\nUnexpected thing happened during my trip. I dropped the Tab on floor on August 8th. It worked normally after the incident, but it started  turning off automatically with any slight moving, I can only use it placing it on table, and has to keep it stable, that means I can not hold it to take any pictures, it could not work when I walk.\n\nI talked with Samsung online twice. I was told that caused by physical damage, therefor, I could be charged (may be $159) even the product is still in its warranty period. I knew they would conclude the problem was caused by the dropping, even it happened over two months later.\n\nSo I do not bother to ship it back to the repairing, just  keep looking for some stores can fix it for me."}

I have only had the tablet for 2 days but so far it has been everything that I have wanted it to be. The display is good to me, I know that it doesn't have the PPI as other higher end tablets but you get what you pay for and to me the screen is great for the money. I can't comment on the battery life of the device but I charged it 2 days ago and I still have 70% battery life left. With that being said I turn the device off when I get done using it. The camera isn't very good but I didn't buy it to take pictures, that is what a camera is for, so that doesn't really bother me. If you are wanting to take pictures then I wouldn't recommend this tablet. All in all, this is a great value buy if you want a device to browse the web and watch videos.\n\nThe one problem I have is I cannot watch Amazon Prime videos but I knew that when I bought the device. Hopefully the lollipop OS update will fix that problem."}

The color and clarity of the screen is amazing. Today I was reading the December 2014 issue of National Geographic and was really impressed with the beauty of all the photos of the digital edition. Reading National Geo. on this tablet is just about the same size as the actual magazine but so much brighter!\n\n  I've just charged it again today (12/3/2014) since getting it on Nov. 28th., pretty good battery time.\n\n  Having never owned an Ipad, I cannot tell you how it compares to an Ipad other than I know this Samsung does have a lot more memory for a lot less $$$. It does have some cloud storage that I have yet to set up.\n\n  I haven't tried the camera yet, not expecting much as the resolution is low. I have much better cameras so that wasn't a negative for me about buying this tablet. I'm hoping I can edit pictures I have taken with this tablet with some free apps that I have yet to find like a few I have found for my Ipod.\n\n  Uses apps from both Google Play as well as Samsung. Comes with Chrome, Internet Explorer browsers installed as well as dropbox."}

I also wish it came with Adobe Flash Player, which supposedly Android tablets, which this one is no longer supports.  I did chat with them, Samsung, and was told they couldn't recommend a third party, just to download some of them and see what works, which isn't the best solution in my opinion.  I read the quick start guide, but having had an Android tablet it was pretty intuitive for me.\n\nThis tablet has a lot of room for apps, which some are pre-installed.  I like that there is a speaker on each side, not a lot of buttons, which for me is good."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "Before buying this; I read plenty of the reviews. With this being my first ever tablet ( ok...I had the ipod touch a few years back. So that doesn't count.) was a bit nervous on how it would perform. Luckly...it is really a good tablet. I love Samsung.\nI've had it a few days now and the only thing I would suggest to others that purchase it; be careful not to press too hard on the power button. I did so on 11/26/11 and the thing wouldn't turn on because the button was wedge too deep.\nI got really nervous...but a minute or so later; the button had somehow return to it's regular position. I pressed it again, and it came on. What can I say ? I have a heavy thumb.\nI love the size and the display is very sharp indeed. great picture quality and graphics. Some of the apps that come with it are garbage and should be disposed off at your earliest connivance.  I ordered a longer power adapter cord because the one that comes with the tablet is wayyyyy too short.\nIt's better to use it to charge the device than using the usb on your computer. On the computer it really charges really slow. Like turtle slow. I think this tablet will serve me well since I only need it for watching movies, web surfing and pictures.\nI highly recommend this tablet."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "This Samsung Tab 4 was purchased to replace an earlier version that was damaged beyond repair.\n\nThe screen on this model is brighter than the previous one, various apps do run faster, the mini-USB charging port is now common with our other charging cables, and the ability to insert a micro-flash card is very nice. I inserted a 64GB Sandisk, and the unit accessed all information just fine.\n\nThis is the 'WiFi Only' model and works fine with my Asus router which is located about 50' and several rooms away. I paired this tablet with a Bluetooth AmazonBasics keyboard and all worked properly.\n\nI have no long term reliability experience with this model, but our previous Samsung tablet lasted over 3 years before being damaged. Hopefully this product will provide equally good reliability.\n\nOverall we are very happy with the improvements to the Samsung Galaxy Tab."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "I've been thinking of a tablet for some time and when a deal came up with the Tab 4, I decided to jump on it.\n\nThings I like:\nEase of use - yes!\n  If you've owned any sort of touch screen, you won't have any issues with this. Wifi is an easy setup. Blu-tooth is an easy setup. Finding apps, adding screens, deleting screens, all super easy. I had to practice a little to do the hand sweep to capture a screen, and I was disappointed that my Samsung TV wasn't new enough to support screen mirroring (which would still work if I chose to buy another device), none of those are limitations on the tablet. The colors are bright and from what I can it is pretty customizable.\n  It worked well with my Samsung TV, including the IR to use as a remote and even came with a handy app that let you view TV listings and change the channel when you chose \"Watch this\".\n  It does a wonderful job at finding other devices and playing content from them. I had to do a little research to find out how to load my contacts, but it worked perfectly. A lot of it seems geared to google for sharing content, but I found when I input my gmail address, it synched everything up pretty well. If you do not use a gmail address, this might be a different experience. (I created a gmail account only because I was having issues with blogger, etc. I feel Google is a lot less intuitive to use than other programs.)\n  I can't honestly tell if the tablet is watching my eyes, but since the screen hasn't gone blank when I've been reading, I assume it's working. Every now and then I would see a message saying it couldn't see my eyes. I haven't been able to mute the device just by holding my hand over it yet, but I haven't tried all that hard either.\n  It is for the most part a very fluid and intuitive interface. I have had one or two things I had to go to YouTube to figure out how to do, but this has been rare.\n  The camera takes good pictures both front and back.\n  I like the double functionality of the buttons and the 2 trays. The top is highly customizable, but geared mostly towards settings. The side tray or the \"split screen\" tray does split screen very well. This is saying something. It's easy to use, to change the size of the 2 screens and to switch them, close them, etc. It doesn't require any head scratching which is saying something in these kinds of interfaces.\n\nThings I don't like:\n  There's not much I don't like to be honest, but here goes. . . .\n  The split screen feature which is much heralded does have some limitations. First, you can only split the screen from the split screen tray, and you can't add other programs to that tray. For example, if I want to start chrome and use the memo app at the same time, I can split the screen. However, if I'm looking at Chrome and I want to use the calculator, nope. The calculator isn't in the tray and can't be added. Oh well, that's not such a big deal, because I can easily minimize one to use the other.\n  Programs don't really close. Unless the program has an \"exit\", you'll hit the \"home\" key to exit, but when you check the taskbar, the program is still technically there. I'm fairly certain it's still using memory and therefore battery power. It would be nice to be able to close the program / window without having to take this extra step. The luxury of the little \"x\" you see in Windows is missing.\n  The tablet comes ready to view pictures, music and videos from devices other than your tablet (for example your PC). However, I couldn't do a simple file transfer. Even the \"my files\" application that came installed couldn't manage this. It will play movies on your PC (on the screen of the tablet), but it doesn't actually transfer the files. I had to download Airdroid to transfer certain files."}

If I had written this review when it was new, it would have been 5 stars. But, starting about 9 months after buying it, it started to become progressively more difficult to charge it.  The connection between the tablet and cable is the problem.  It became more and more loose, and it was hit or miss whether it would charge.  Now, it is impossible to charge it. The tablet' and cable never been abused, or damaged.  It just seems like a poorly engineered design that can't stand up to frequent use.

The sound quality is better than expected.\nThe size is great, it isn't too heavy.\nThe interface is pretty intuitive - if you want more options for whatever you're looking at, press and hold your finger over the item, that simple. It's easy to navigate.\nCameras are useless in low light but satisfactory in sunlight.\nNo issues with Hancom Office - you can edit and create documents. I look forward to this replacing my laptop as my homework machine, drastically reducing the weight of my backpack. I still need to find a reliable bluetooth keyboard though.\nIt seems like the touch screen registering finger strokes might be slightly off, like I click one spot and it thinks I clicked slightly up and to the left of where I did. Slightly. Or perhaps it's the number of pixels it recognizes as a finger stroke that messes with it. I'm not sure. That really is only noticeable if paying strict attention though.\nBattery has been great. I use it pretty much all day with lots of internet and some gaming mixed in and the lowest I've gotten it is 20%.\nThe expandable memory is my favorite thing about it. I love being able to have multiple memory (media) cards. One for music, one for movies, I always keep the other one in my backpack (Samsung has a sweet warranty on their microSD cards).\nHaven't had a chance yet to experiment with the GPS function of it when no wifi is available, but with google maps the wifi will tell me what part of what room of what building I'm in on campus (is that just because it knows where the modem/router is?)\nOverall, I'd recommend it. It's way less expensive than an iPad Air, or the new Tab S but it still gets the job done with room to spare. I'm very happy I decided last minute to not fork out the $599 to get the iPad Air 2 and went with the $259 Tab 4 instead."}

The number of system setings is very low, only the very basics.\nIn order to improve the functionality it would be necessary to root it, install different launcher etc. - not worth the effort."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "Excellent tablet for an excellent price. I sold my iPad and upgraded to this Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 because it's a better value, can do everything the iPad can do for hundreds of dollars less than the cheapest 10 inch iPad, and has the added functionality of a micro SD slot which can expand the file storage memory by 64 gigabytes, to a total of 80 gigabytes counting the 16 built in. In fact, you can buy a few cheap micro SD cards on Amazon and easily back up a lifetime of pictures, video, and music with this Galaxy tab. Try to do that with an overpriced Apple product, not even possible!"}

We have never had the 1st problem with any Samsung product. Their screens are of the utmost quality and clarity, hard to go wrong with Samsung. Made in S. Korea in case you didn't know. Personally I think Apple is way behind Samsung; Samsung uses Google software and it is far superior to Apple in doing tons of things Apple won't."}

I wanted to have a bigger screen for Kindle books and websites so I bought this product, Galaxy Tab 4 10.1 inch.\n\nI got what I wanted, the bigger screen, with one problem.\n\nWhen you increase the font size of the screen, the screen doesn't resize itself for many websites. So I have to move the screen left and right to read the whole sentence.\n\nSome webpages like CNN does resize the screen for bigger fonts, but others like Yahoo doesn't. I thought at first it's the website specific problem. So I tried the same webpages with my Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. It resized the screen to fit the contents.\n\nI searched Setting to find whether there is a way for automatic screen size adjustment, but no luck.\n\nDoes anyone know how to make this Galaxy Tab 4 (10.1) automatically resize the screen to accomodate the larger or smaller font size?\n\nI will give only three stars for this reason. If you have an older version and don't have any problem with it, stick with it. This newer version tablet seems to be no better."}

The screen is not working properly (but I think that's due to the s***ty packaging they sent it in). Sometimes I have to touch certain parts of the screen several times until it might finally react.\n2. The charging cable it came with is ridiculously short.\n3. The battery life seems fairly short. My tablet was fully charged this morning. I played a game on there for 5 minutes, checked Facebook a few times during the day and wrote one email (took me about 3 minutes) and now (in the late evening) it's dead already.\nUpdate:\nLast time I charged the tablet it took two days to charge. It randomly dies doesn't matter if it just showed 99% battery or 4%.\nThe screen now randomly starts flickering like crazy."}

Its very quick and does even more than the Ipad. The home page can be totally personalized with stuff which is nice. The camera isn't as good but I have an Iphone 5 to take pics and video with, you wouldnt bring a huge tablet with you somewhere to take pics anyway so the camera on it is pointless. The screen is really crisp and bright and the games are quick and responsive. Amazed at the quality of the picture on this. You can expand the memory with a micro sd card, and cannot with an Ipad. Very important.\nIt has plenty of apps for free on the Google play store, and I found the ones you do have to pay for are less expensive than the Apple store apps. I got this so my daughter would have something to do in the truck when I travel back and forth to Oregon, which is a 14 hour drive, and the battery lasts really long so hopefully it will last on a trip!\nSo far happy with it but its only been a few days so I will update my review if I find any probs with it."}

It is light weight for its size yet not so light that it feels flimsy.  The tablet actually has a very rugged solid feel to it.  The screen is very bright and clear and renders video very sharply without having to pay for the super high definition model.  And the battery life is phenomenal as far as I am concerned.  I leave my devices on charge while I sleep and use them off and on all day.  Lately I have been using this tablet for hours at a time searching the internet, playing games, and viewing my blogs and such.  And at the close of my day I have yet to see the battery below 50%.  And I keep my screen locked in the nearly brightest mode.  With the auto bright switched on and the other battery saver functions activated you could get even better battery life.  But I like my scheen bright.\n\nI love Samsung phones and tablets and also have the Galaxy Note 3. This tablet is not a sharp as the Note 3 but then it doesn't have the Super AMOLED screen on the tablet.  You can get it but they are quite expensive yet.  I wanted the Note 10.1 2014 Edition of this tablet mainly for the pen function.  But for the price difference this one serves my needs very well."}

First of all, and this is probably my misunderstanding, but I thought that this being a Galaxy Tab 4, that it would act like a larger version of my Galaxy S4, with the same features.  However, I bought a Samsung HDMI cable which works perfectly for my S4 and is, for some reason, not compatible with this (in point of fact, Im not seeing any HDMI cables for it.)  Additionally, the one other feature it lacks from the S4 that I would have absolutely loved to see is the auto-dim feature.  Ive brought this camping a few times, and in order to save battery, Id like it dimmed at night.  Its just kind of annoying having to do this manually, especially in the morning when the sun is so bright I can barely see the screen from dimming it the night before and have trouble raising the brightness.\n\nSure, these things are pretty nit-picky, which is why it gets four stars out of five.

I can use Google Play to read my books and highlight my comments/answers and make notes next to my answers. It plays downloaded videos very clearly out in the local community. I added the 64 gigabyte Samsung EVO SDXC UHS micro SD card to expand memory as it is well know for Samsung products to run at high speeds and stay secure. I wish the included power charging cord was longer than 2 feet and package should have included 1 free anti glare screen protector. Tablet is fast and easy to navigate. Included Android operating system is well designed and easy to use in comparison to windows programs. I hope you enjoy using your tablet as much as we have."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "I have been a tablet owner for many years, and have owned several different ones.  I started years ago with a Motorola Xoom, then upgraded to a Galaxy Tab and then to Tab 2.  I now own a Galaxy Note 2014.  This purchase in particular was for my mother-in-law who has been my new baby's nanny while my wife has gone back to work.  I LOVE Samsung products, and this tablet certainly does not disappoint.  It is very fast, and has the bells and whistles that make Samsung products great.\n\nThe parts of this that made me ding it back to a 4-star though are more nit picky.  First, my mother-in-law was planning to use this to also take pictures.  That would have been great, except this tablet does NOT have a flash on it.  I was extremely surprised, as the previous Tab's had flashes.  Had I known this, I would not have made this purchase.  I believe on these later models, they did away with this option and have put that onto the Pro version.  In the end though, it is my fault for not double checking on this prior to purchasing.  The other gripe I have, is the limitation of drive space.  Me personally, I watch videos and such while commuting on a train and space is very important.  However, since there is a microSD port, this is not of too big a concern for me.\n\nAll in all, this is a very fast and good tablet.  Just be sure that it fits your needs well. If you intend to take pictures with it, I would recommend upgrading to the Pro version as it has the flash (which you will certainly miss if you take pictures).  If you are just wanting to play games, surf the web and do email, then this tablet is an excellent option.\n\nAs with all my reviews, feel free to ask any questions and I will be happy to answer them."}

I was looking for a tablet that I could easily use apps that I used on my iphone (facebook, twitter, netflix, hbogo, other games) and I also wanted a tablet where I could store documents. This tablet gives you the Play Store where you can get so many apps that you have on your apple devices. You can also save documents and upload files when writing emails, applying for jobs, etc. I use this tablet daily and it makes everything so much easier that I can carry around this small device.\n\nI was debating between this size and the size one step down and I have to say I am incredibly happy with my decision to take the larger device. You can get this larger screen for a fairly cheap price compared to other brands and it is a great screen. Like I said I use my tablet for watching movies/tv, going on apps/playing games, sending documents, and using the internet. I have no issue with the quality of the screen, in my opinion there is nothing wrong- it looks exactly like how it does on other devices. This device is also very easy to use and understand. If you're debating between tablets I would strongly consider this one and this larger size because price makes a big difference."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "After using my 1st gen Nexus 7 for two years, I wanted a tab with a larger screen and decided on the Galaxy Tab 4 10.1, after a quick review of what is currently available. I've used it for a couple of days and have to say I'm a bit underwhelmed. It's not a bad unit, but it can be a bit laggy at times and the screen is rather disappointing. It's not as sharp and the colors not as accurate as I was hoping for. Although it's noticeable mainly with videos, text is also not as sharp as I'd like, which can lead to eye strain. The pixel density is around 130 ppi which is pretty low, and jagged edges and text anti-aliasing are visible (depends to a degree how far away from your eyes you hold the tab). Although the resolution is touted as 'high resolution' (which is technically correct in HD TV or desktop monitor terms), for a tablet this is misleading due to the close viewing distance. I also feel that the price is a bit high for what you get in terms of specs and build quality.\n\nMy expectations in a tablet have been raised since getting my Galaxy S4 smartphone, which has a razor sharp, high contrast, super-amoled screen (w/ 440 ppi pixel density) and faster processor compared to this tablet. Using this tab feels like a step backwards in comparison. I've also realized that the 10\" form factor isn't ideal for my uses. I'll be returning mine and will order either a Galaxy Pro 8.4 or Galaxy S 8.4 to replace it. The 8.4\" form factor is significantly lighter and much more comfortable to use, while the higher res screen should more than offset the size advantage of the 10.1\" w/ lower res. I'd consider an ipad mini /w retina display, but the lack of expandable storage is a deal breaker. All of these alternatives have pixel densities above 300 ppi, which is supposedly the point at which individual pixels are indistinguishable to the naked eye at the typical tablet viewing distance (though some argue that even 300 is still far too low).\n\nIMO, spending a bit more for a superior tablet is well worth it, considering the hundreds of hours I'll be staring at it for the next three years or so. But then again, I'm not so young anymore and my eyes aren't as good as they used to be. If I were in my teens or 20's, or on a tight budget, I'd probably just keep this one ;)\n\nUpdate 9/30/14: The Galaxy Tab Pro, which is superior to this model (Tab 4), is now on sale at BB and the price is just slightly higher than the Tab 4. If you can get one before they sell out, it's a far better choice than the Tab 4."}

I would also like a HDMI port to display my work on a TV.\nOne highly irritating feature is the omnipresent GOOGLE. I do not like Google at all as it wants too much of my personal information.

Overall it functions OK, overpriced for the slow rated CPU as compared to others in it's class. My problem is Samsung is guaranteed, to strip out something and of course this time, they chose to strip out the MHL function to an HDMI connection, for a TV. All the previous versions had it, even a major selling point by Samsung. My daughter is off to college, well if she wants to mirror her Tablet to a, yeah you guess it a Samsung LED TV, it won't work because it's not wireless. Samsung expects everyone now to own or buy a smart wireless TV.  The only reason I gave it a two is because it turns on.\n\nAll I can say anytime I have dealt with a Samsung product, it pretty much have always had a shortcut to save a few cents. I really did not want to buy this, because I knew something would be stripped out. I have had there LED TV's fail in less than five months, then returned without even been properly reassembled.\n\nAt some point people will realize,  that Samsung is not what it seems.

Has to be charged everyday even with light use and unless you turn it off after every reading session, rather than just log out, the battery drain continues becaue apparently the syncing continues constantly with various clouds and the Samsung mother ship. Of course that 10.1\" screen is a power hog but that's why I bought the thing anyway so not really complaining\nOtherwise it is fine. Good screen color/resolution, lots of features and very responsive OS(Kit Kat 4.2 is what it starts with).\n\nPrice for 32 GB is very competitive. Added a 32 GB SD card for $20 and not like other tablets, you can actually load applications into it too. So go ahead and load up on everyting you ever wanted! Just buy extra SD cards and you can store buckets of stuff."}

The battery life is amazing, depending on what you do. If you listen to music with the screen off it only uses about 1 percent per hour! Reading will use about 5 percent per hour I'd say. Not much though. Only issue is playing games will drain it, but not as bad as other tablets or cells. I want to buy all my family this tablet, but for now I will just have to share."}

The touch screen does not often activate and it takes a great deal of pressure to activate.  It is extremely frustrating to have to press and press and press with no response.

The only difficulty I had is the external micro SDcard can't be used for storage directly. I have to transfer documents, ebooks from my notebook into the micro SDcard & then mount it on the tablet.\n\nI did check the work around via rooted device, but mine is not rooted so I hope there will be some workaround soon to solve this writing into external micro SDcard issue."}

The screen is crisp and clear, operation is very easy and user friendly, it operates on an android system so you have all the apps available to the android market, the placement of buttons is well thought out, and my favorite thing by far is the option to add on to your storage with an SD card. Love this tablet, am completely happy with my purchase."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "Let's face it, everyone wants to know how it compares to the God of tablets: the iPad. It's every bit as good. Now that it's common for people to jail break their iPads to be more like Droid devices, it's pretty obvious which is more user friendly.\n\nThe only downside of going with Droid rather than Apple is the app availability, but that's hardly the fault of a device. Strictly speaking, this thing is awesome. I didn't buy it over the iPad to save a couple hundred bucks, I bought it because it's more versatile and practical."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "Pros : Sleek, lightweight, has the same \"home\" button used on Samsung's smart phone line, with similar menus.\nJust fast enough to play a properly formatted movie or some music.\nDecent color reproduction.\n\nCons : Abysmally poor sound quality and volume ( You'll need headphones or a bluetooth speaker ).\nBattery life and screen resolution not up to par with competitors for the same price.\nCharge time is ridiculously long.\nIn order to use a card reader or external usb device, you must buy an expensive, proprietary dongle from Samsung. While using said dongle with a card reader, battery percentage as reported on screen never goes down, no warning of low battery, and it will drain until tablet shuts off. To add insult to injury, the dongle plugs in the charging port on the bottom of the tablet, making it impossible to set the tablet upright to watch movies. Whoever designed that port should be fired."}

This works quite well with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-Galaxy-Multimedia-Desktop-Charging-Dock-for-Samsung-Galaxy-Phones/dp/B0089VO71U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung Galaxy Multimedia Desktop Charging Dock for Samsung Galaxy Phones</a>&nbsp;(although make sure that you buy it directly from Amazon, as some of the affiliated sellers are sending clone/counterfeit units that break almost instantly) going into docking mode, charging, and using the external speakers.\n\nI take my Tab with me to read comic books on the bus on my commute, and then when I get home, I dock it and load up Netflix, Hulu+, or Stitcher on my desk, turn it to face the bed when I'm ready to doze off, and never have to power on the space heater that disguises itself as a TV.\n\nOne odd note: I also have the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Samsung-Galaxy-Smart-Dock-Multimedia-Hub-for-Galaxy-Note-II-Galaxy-S-4-Galaxy-S-4-Active-Galaxy-Mega/dp/B009QW3TBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Samsung Galaxy Smart Dock Multimedia Hub for Galaxy Note II/ Galaxy S 4/ Galaxy S 4 Active/ Galaxy Mega</a>&nbsp;which works beautifully for my Note 2, but works ONLY as a stand and charger with the Tab 4.

Beautiful picture, best keyboard (allowing SWYPE), easily add storage, responds quickly, simple to use. HOWEVER, this table will not allow user to view Amazon video on this device. Contacted Amazon. Received note that Amazon video currently does not stream over Android. So, sadly, I am returning to store. If you have no need to stream Amazon video, then this issue will, of course, not affect you. Good Luck."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "The first one I received was defective. However with Amazons amazing return plan this was a minor problem.\n\nIf it weren't for the following two things I'd give it a 4 or a 5 however\n\n1) If you connect it to a computer this device is not seen as a simple storage device. It thinks it's a music player using something called MTP. This is truly annoying since I wanted to simply move files to the device using the standard drag and drop methodology. There are workarounds but they are annoying\n\n2) It will NOT charge off of a computers USB port. I left it plugged in for an hour and it didn't gain even a percentage point. This truly sucks big time. You can charge it from the wall socket but not from your computer."}

I love Apple products but this Samsung Tab 4 is better, faster, easier to use and comes with a host of standard features that Apple does not even have available such as opening most attachments, file system connectivity and what I love is the enhanced print features. Finally, there's the price. At half the price there is no question that this is the tablet to buy."}

We like it BUT it turns out that some of these tablets have problems with Bluetooth and we must have gotten one of them. Other than that so far it has been good. I need to contact Amazon and find out what can be done about the Bluetooth issue.\n\nNote: I did do some research on this and found that Samsung does not have a fix and they really do not seem to know what to do about it. So if you want to purchase one make sure it will scan and detect bluetooth devices before you purchase it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00JKCH4X0", "review": "The product is perfect and I'll get to that in a minute, but something else needs to be addressed.\n\nAmazons quality control or shipping control needs to be checked, or maybe its the carriers? I'm not sure.\n\nI personally know my local USPS does not handle packages like some Fedex and UPS workers we've all seen in Youtube viral videos destroying packages. I can't speak for the rest of the shipping team in other parts of the city and country. The box it arrived in wasn't damaged at all though, it had a minor crease in it, can't even call it a dent. The Tablet however arrived with a crack in the upper left hand corner of the screen, which at first seemed very minor and my mother still loved the gift and decided she would keep it anyway due to her being old and not caring for superficial things like us modern day kids do. However, almost a week later she started to complain to me that she couldn't figure out how to use some of the features correctly. I inspected the product further and after some testing I noticed about a quarter of the screen where the crack was located was not functioning properly. While there were no cracks in the screen itself, only the glass protecting the screen, the finger sensor was not reading her finger so when she tried to click on things to swipe it didn't work in that specific region leading to almost all if not all the apps not working properly.\n\nTalking to Amazon they offered a replacement or refund, I would rather have a replacement considering my moms loves the idea of being able to watch T.v and E-mail from anywhere. I opted for that and now I'll be receiving a replacement in a few days.\n\nOverall happy, just wish it didn't come as it did.\n\nThe product however 5/5 Stars, its a tablet on steroids, No need for overpriced Ipads."}
