{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "Let me start by saying I have owned an iPad, iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad Mini, Asus Transformer TF300T, Sony Tablet S, Toshiba eXcite 10.1, Motorola Xoom, Nexus 7, and Nexus 10.  There are different reasons I have continued looking fo the best Tablet Possible for my needs.  Oh and my wife has a Samsung Ativ Smart PC Windows 8 Tablet (Great device).\n\nBUILD QUALITY\n\nI know a lot has been said about the quality of the materials and how it is plastic; Let me say I have seen all different builds and while the back might not be as high quality as the aluminum of the iPad, the Gorilla Glass 2 screen is miles ahead of the Apple offering and is almost completely resistant to scratching. Overall I feel that the build is very good and I like the no slip backing more than any other tablet I have used.\n\nSCREEN QUALITY\n\nThe screen is flat out amazing!  The Retina iPad has a 3 MP screen, a 1080P display is about 2 MP so, at 4 MP this screen even has your TV set beat!  Contrast is good and color favors accuracy over pop.  In short, you likely will not find a better screen on a tablet for some time to come but, the iPad Retina and Transformer Infinity Displays are as close to this screen as you're going to get.  Still, there's not a lick of aliasing on this screen even when zoomed in.\n\nSOUND QUALITY\n\nFor some reason most tablet manufacturers decided that the side and back of their tablets were the best place for speakers and the results have been mixed.  The Nexus 10 has them bookending the screen and it delivers sharp, crisp, full sound where others fall flat.  This is another area where this tablet tops the competition.\n\nPERFORMANCE & STABILITY\n\nThe combination of a light weight OS and top notch hardware have made this possibly the fastest tablet on the market.  At the very least it on par with the iPad for all around performance.  For the most part the tablet is a pleasure to use but, there are times when the unit locks up for no apparent reason and yet, I don't consider this a deal breaker as the other 99% of the time it performs flawlessly.\n\nIf I cannot resolve the issues with the locks, it could become an issue quick.\n\nUpdating the Review as it appears that others were right, Google Currents is now disabled on the Tablet and all of my Lock-ups are gone!  I will be bumping the review up to 4 stars until I get more familiar with it.  Who knows, maybe in a week this will be a 5 star Tablet.\n\nOS & APPS\n\nObviously this is a Nexus product so it will automatically be updated whenever Google releases a new version of Android, an this is a huge strength for the tablet as it will likely get at least two operating system updates per year.\n\nApps are scalable in Android so they will most likely scale just fine but lower quality textures will make for a slightly less than optimal viewing experience.  As things mature, we will likely get some very sharp and nice looking graphics.\n\nI have heard claims that Android is not good for Productivity but, it isn't accurate.  A few of the Apps I like for Productivity Purposes are...\n\nKingsoft Office - Awesome Office Suite Free On Android!\nMagisto - Video Editing\nMint - Financial Management from Intuit\nSketchbook Pro Tablet Edition - Excellent Drawing App\nPen Supremacy - Doodle, Jot, make Notes or Diagrams\nAutoCAD WS - Autodesk CAD App\nGoogle Drive - Cloud Data Storage\nPhotoshop Touch - Decent Photo Editing On The Fly\nKindle - eBook Reader\nPlay Books - Google eBook Reader (Best Available Period)\nDeuterIDE - Supports 40 Languages And Feature Built-In Compiler\nMaestro - Musical Note Taking App\n\nAs you can see, you can pretty much do anything you want with this Tablet and it might not be as powerful as a Desktop but, it is every bit as productive as a Windows RT tablet or an iPad.\n\nMedia Consumption is decent but, not great.  You do have multiple music sources, movie sources, and book reading apps but, movie and TV apps tend to be lower quality than what I get from my Apple TV (This is a problem to me as I would prefer not to support Apple at all).\n\nCAMERAS\n\nWith a 1.9 MP Rear Facing Camera and a 5 MP Front Facing Camera, this tablet does quite well, and although the front facing camera doesn't match that of the Transformer TF700 it is on par with the iPad 3 and 4.\n\nGPS\n\nVery solid but, not as fast as the Nexus 7.  Still very good over all and there isn't an iOS device on the planet that would be as good without Google Maps.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI really like the Nexus 10 and at 32 Gigs it really is hard for me to beat at $499.  With that said, I will keep it and rate the device a Cautionary 4 until Google fixes the issue with Google Currents Locking the Tablet Up.  Yes it is about once a day but, it really shouldn't be happening at all and there are several complaints on the Android Forums regarding the issue.  Anyway, once that is taken care of, it will be the best Tablet on the block.\n\nAlso, I walked into Staples and Bought my 32 Gig model without any waiting so, don't pay these crazy prices because they market doesn't bare the weight of this sellers asking price!\n\nUPDATED 3-23-13\n\nIt appears that 4.2.2 has indeed fixed everything that has caused the Tablet to lock up and I couldn't be more pleased with it.  This tablet is extremely fast and stable now, I would recommend this over any tablet on the market."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "With the Google Nexus 10, Google and Samsung have managed to come up with a technological wonder. Google has made the right calls in term of aesthetics and industrial design, while Samsung was able to bring the best hardware to the game. The display is beautiful and the system has enough muscles to handle any media you throw at it.\n\nThe most surprising aspect of the Google Nexus 10 is the price: At $399 (16GB, WiFi), the Google Nexus 10 is significantly cheaper than Apple's iPad 4 which beats it only in polygonal graphics. This is a very aggressive pricing, especially if you think that this powerful tablet costs a mere $70 more than the iPad mini which is far less potent.\n\nIf you want a tablet for basic things like email, web, gaming and apps, this is the best option for now. It is both cheaper and better than most of the competition. There are a few exceptions: if you want a stylus, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is a better alternative, and if you need Microsoft Office compatibility, the Microsoft Surface RT would be better. Unless you absolutely want iOS, there is simply no compelling reason to pay $100 more for an iPad. If you do, well... it's settled."}

I love mobile devices, and have plenty of experience with Android, iOS, Windows RT, and webOS devices.  Now for the review.\n\nPROS\n+ Dazzlingly sharp screen.  If you're looking at the Nexus 10, you've likely seen this specification front and center.  The resolution handily beats that of Apple's third and fourth generation iPads, but in practice it's hard to see the improvement.  That's not because the Nexus 10's screen isn't an improvement-- if you look, it's there, and reading web pages is truly a joy-- but after a certain point, you really run into diminishing returns.\n+ Rich content experience.  While you do hit some diminishing returns, the Nexus 10 has quickly become one of my favorite tablets for content consumption, whether that's watching video or reading books.  While both the newer iPads and this tablet (and really, a number of other excellent Android options, like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ASUS-TF700T-B1-CG-10-1-Inch-Tablet-Champagne/dp/B008F4NL0O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ASUS TF700T-B1-CG 10.1-Inch Tablet (Champagne)</a>) now come with 1080p or better screens, Android tablets tend to have the edge when it comes to YouTube and video content due to their 16:9 aspect ratios (although they all do quite well, really).  The Nexus 10's screen helps make web and text reading great, which is important considering many find the 16:9 ratio awkward for such tasks (more below).\n+ Sleek, svelte build out of great materials.  The backing is soft-touch and ever-so-slightly rubberized, and while not quite as easy to grip as a Nexus 7, the device sticks in the hand.  Perhaps more importantly, it has a nice, warm feeling to it-- one complaint I've had about all-metal tablets like the iPads and premium Transformer Pads is that holding cold metal in your hand feels premium, but often uncomfortable.  There's zero flex in the chassis anywhere, nothing creaks, and the slim, trim profile looks great.  I personally think it looks friendlier than an iPad, but I will note that if you're fond of angular and straight-edged designs, the Nexus 10's pronounced curves may throw you.  On the other hand, it's thin and light, and comfortable in the hand.\n\nOh, and branding is minimal.  Most of the required stuff is under a neat little panel that snaps off to let you attach cases and keyboards and such (although said accessories are noticeably missing at this time-- someone dropped the ball on this one).\n+ Excellent performance.  Performance is really determined by both the hardware and the software, and for now, I'll look at the hardware.  Powered by a new chip of the A15 \"Eagle\" variety, Samsung's Exynos 5250 destroys basically every Android tablet chipset out on the market (note I am not including the Snapdragon S4 Pro, as it's not really available on tablets yet outside of Qualcomm's reference build).  Zero lag, zero stutter, fast and snappy graphics playback, and fluid gameplay (but take this last with caution: while every review I've seen has praised its gaming ability, I myself play relatively simple games like Steambirds or Anomaly: HD).  Sometimes the tablet will run a little warm, but none of this lap/hand burning people complain about so much these days.\n+ Android 4.2 under the hood.  Android's come a long, long way in recent years, and even if you're a dedicated Apple user, you should at least look at Google's latest offering with an open mind.  Stock Android has morphed from (what I believe!  Important caveat!) a gaudy, neo-futuristic mess (Gingerbread) into a sleek, industrial, polished, and smooth system (beginning with Ice Cream Sandwich).  In more recent releases, the OS has become far more understated visually, serving only to help you navigate your apps and content and getting out of your way besides.  Android 4.2 has released several new features of interest to most buyers, but I'll look at two in particular.  The first is multi-user support: now, you can have one tablet service multiple users, with a tap on the lockscreen switching between them.  That means a \"family\" tablet can also hold your personal work e-mail, with no fear of other family members accessing your data.  The second is a quick settings toggle.  Android OEMs have long built in Wi-Fi/GPS/Bluetooth and other switches into their devices, but until recently you would need an app like Power Toggles to replicate the same on a stock Android device.  While Google's implementation of settings toggles leaves a little to be desired, at least the functionality is there (unlike a certain fruit-named brand-- seriously Apple, all I want to do is toggle Wi-Fi.  Do I really have to jailbreak for that?!)\n+ Great connectivity.  You get a micro-HDMI out port and micro-USB, and it's the latter that really opens up the device's capabilities.  Buy a cheap USB OTG cable from Amazon (you can get them for south of $2 with free shipping if you look), and hey presto, your Nexus 10 can work with USB keyboards, mice, and with a little tinkering, flash drives.  Good way to solve the limited storage issue (see below).\n+ Sound sound sound.  Taking cues from Samsung's Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and Galaxy Tab 10.1N designs, the speakers are now on the front panel of the device.  The stereo set pushes out quite a good bit of clear, loud, audible sound.  For a tablet, the only device I've seen that comes remotely close is the HP Touchpad.  But as with all things, keep in mind that the device is ultimately a tablet, so don't expect too much in the way of bass.  It's plenty loud though-- I can't fathom why reviewers complain about volume.\n+ Dual NFC receivers, one on the front, one on the back.  While NFC is just emerging as a technology, if you have another Android device with NFC, you can easily throw links and such between devices (although Chrome sync handles that quite nicely as well), or buy some NFC stickers and play around with an app like NFC Task Launcher for some automation fun.\n\nCONS\n- No microSD slot.  Personally, I don't find this an issue whatsoever, but if you're a big fan of local content then I can see how this might bite you.  Google has long refused to put microSD on its Nexus devices, citing a number of technical and usability challenges (both sides of which I happen to agree with, but I won't go into detail here).  If you're really out of space for the road, see my above section on USB OTG cables and use a cheap flash drive to expand your storage.  It looks a little silly, yes, but for movie watching on the go, it'll do quite nicely.  Google's on-demand download for its streaming services (Play Music, Play Movies, etc.) has so far let me keep what I want on my device.\n- New layout.  Again, not a huge issue for me, but if you've used Android tablets before, you will have to relearn a few things.  Navigation softkeys have been moved to the center, and notifications moved to a notification bar at the top.  This change has grown on me with time, since it preserves muscle memory between my phone and tablet, but some of Google's justifications just don't sell me.  For one, center navigation softkeys leave a huge amount of wasted space floating around the bottom of the screen, and I liked having those keys and notifications in the bottom corners so I could hit them with my thumbs.  Good thing that screen is so magnificent, aye?\n- Aspect ratio.  Android tablets are notorious for being landscape-only beasts, and although this device is quite tolerable in portrait, everything about it screams to be used in landscape.  While this is usually fine, when reading scrolling content (such as books, web pages, and so on), sometimes Apple's 4:3 ratio is far more pleasant on the eyes, especially as such content is usually vertical, not horizontal.\n- Cameras.  Pass please.  Tablets do not make good shooters, and while this one has an LED flash, it's thoroughly unremarkable.\n- Somewhat understated buttons makes for some frustration.  Power, volume up, volume down-- three buttons with distinguishable functions.  So Google/Samsung, why put them all right next to each other with such low profiles?  Sometimes I sleep the device instead of turning down the volume, which is just silly.\n- Battery life.  Please read this one with care-- the Nexus 10 does have a great battery and it lasts quite a long time.  Rigorous tests have shown it lasts just as long as its competitors (the iPad included) in usage scenarios.  But I have always (subjectively) found my iPad lasts longer in standby than any of my other Android tablets.  Take what you will from that, but again, ultimately it does its job quite well.\n- App ecosystem for tablets is a bit underwhelming.  Again, please read this one carefully-- this is often leveled as a make-or-break charge on Android tablets.  While I agree that the market is a little underwhelming, let's be real-- we don't ever have hundreds of apps on our tablets, and Google Play now has more than enough to cover most of my needs.  In addition, the Nexus 7's enormously successful launch saw a huge wave of new, 7\"-optimized apps.  I expect to see increased interest in the 10.1\" form factor with the Nexus 10.  I've found the apps to do everything I want to do, and with some digging, I believe anyone could.\n- Consumption, not production.  While you certainly can use this device for production (particularly with a Bluetooth or USB keyboard), and Android gives you real filesystem access, you can't really escape that the Nexus 10 is a content consumption device.  So are the iPads.  In fact, the only two tablets I've seen and used that took productivity seriously were the Transformer Pad series and the Microsoft Surface RT.  The Transformers destroy most Android tablets when it comes to productivity, and (I believe) are in turn destroyed by the Surface when it comes to serious Office-work and overall versatility.  Obviously this is a point for debate and contention, but this is my stance based on my experiences with these devices.  Feel free to comment if you disagree!\n\nOn the whole, do I recommend the Nexus 10?  Wholeheartedly.  Absolutely.  With one little problem.  The price.  The Nexus 10 is excellently priced at $399 on Google Play for the 16GB Wi-Fi variant.  So why is it being sold at $549 and above here on Amazon?  It's quite simple-- third-party sellers routinely exaggerate the list price so that they can comply with Amazon's \"list price or lower\" rule, while still turning a profit on flipping an in-demand device.  You can argue it's supply and demand-- I think it's dishonest marketing.  Buy from Google Play if you can, or see if you can wait just a bit for the vultures to be brought down by more legitimate resellers.\n\nEither way, I hope this helps, and just comment if you have questions!"}

After charging it for a few hours, I started it up and immediately began getting error messages. After hitting ok on the first message, it is quickly followed by another and another and another and another, basically it never ends. After looking into the problem via research and having some computer savvy folks take a look at it, it appears this tablet is operating on an outdated 4.4 operating system which is causing the system to crash. Apparently, in order for it to function properly, it needs to have the latest o.s. installed which would be marshmellow 6.0 for android devices from what I'm told. Either way, I spent a whole lot of money for a defective device. Buyers beware!"}

Finally the last person I spoke with informed me that the Nexus 10 will not do what all the other techs said it would do, and what I expected it to do when I purchased it. IT CANNOT READ A SD CARD!  I found it amazing that a tablet with such a great screen cannot import images from a SD card reader.  If you want to load images from your card reader directly into the tablet, FORGET IT!  The only way to import images is via a laptop or desktop PC.  I do landscape photography and often hike for hours to get a good shot.  It would have been great to be able to view my images, in the field, on a high quality screen. I made the naive assumption that all quality tablets could do such an elementary task as reading a SD card. Samsung never said it could not read an SD card, I feel deceived by omission."}

Bright screen, sharp color, easy to hold with one hand in either landscape or portrait orientation. Note that when held in portrait mode screen is nearly as wide as Nexus 7 in landscape and screen height is a bit more than twice Nexus 7 landscape height thus viewing area is ca2x that of Nexus 7 plus weight of Nexus 10 in portrait makes the weight difference from Nexus 7 seem to disappear. Borders are sufficiently wide to permit holding without accidentally touching touch sensitive area of screen. Virtual touchscreen keyboard is plenty large for adult fingers yet does not obliderate much screen space. The odd rubber like coating on back has just the right texture to feel good in the hand and not be the least bit slippery. Device is fast and apps and features have worked quickly and flawlessly. Battery life ... huh??? ... what battery life??? Someone at Samsung ought to fall on a sword!!!

The screen was great, the sound was great, and it was a great little tablet.\n\nSo...I guess you're wondering about it only getting 3 stars? Well, I was happily upgrading it each time, going to the next version and then the next---when Google made a stunning announcement: As of late 2015, only a little over a year after I bought it, they weren't going to upgrade it again--to the next version, called Marshmallow.\nThe way I see it, I shell out $370 for this thing and in barely a year and 4 months later, it was already an antique! Heck, according to Moore's Law, computer power would double about every 18 months. I'm not even there yet!\n\nThe other thing that really bothered me about this tablet is that, for some reason, almost no one ever bothered to make new fancy tablet covers for it, or stands or whatever else all the other models always got--except for the poor 'old' Nexus 10. It seems that no company ever really bothered to put much thought into creating anything to it. All the things I bought for it were mostly for 'anything', meaning they were made to fit various tablets--not JUST for the Nexus 10! Look at the Galaxy or some of the smaller versions of the Nexus. How about the iPad? They have scores of things for them.\nSo, for a tablet that I thought for sure would be a real winner because of the great graphics and sound, not to mention all the great reviews--it appeared that no one else cared for it. No one ever thought it was 'worthy' to create special things JUST for it. How sad is that? It's really sad because it really IS a good machine! Top notch in nearly every way--except that it appeared that after the fanfare died off, people and companies rapidly forgot about it and totally ignored it.\nSeems like Google didn't even care about it enough to make a good case for it.\nI think for my next tablet, I'm going to possibly shun Google the way it shunned the N10.

I like how the edges are tapered because it makes it easier to hold and use in your hands. The material on the back of the tablet is a satiny rubber that makes it much easier to grip but isn't so rubbery that it attract a bunch of lint and dust. The screen display is so vivid, you can definitely tell its better than a smartphone. The haptic feedback on the tablet is also really nice too, the vibration isn't too weak or too strong. I was surprised by how good the camera on this is. This is the first Nexus device I have used but I have an Android smart phone so the coordination between the two is very easy. I would suggest this tablet more for apps, internet, and leisure use rather than as a school device just because it can be annoying trying to use an Android platform for school. Some of the software I need to use for homework isn't compatible with my tablet and this doesnt have a keyboard so typing long notes or papers on it isn't great. If you're looking to use a tablet for school I would suggest the Microsoft Surface. One thing that does sometimes annoy be about this tablet is how much screen space is wasted by the black border. Other than that this tablet is great for having for functions in-between your laptop and phone."}

It has amazing performance with gaming, streaming live 1080p footage (soccer games), running benchmarks, etc. The battery life, with heavy gaming, lasted me from 10-12 hours depending on the amount of gameplay I was doing on that particular day. The front facing speakers deliver sound that is as good or better than HTC's Boomsound, which is saying a lot considering the awesome sound delivered by HTC's speakers. Once you upgrade to Lollipop however, you get a buttery-smooth experience that is amazing to say the least. Also, the battery life becomes much longer at about 14-16 hours of heavy gaming because of lollipops new power-saving features. Personally, I prefer the Nexus 7 2013 because of its portability and ease of use in one hand."}

I use my nexus 10 on a daily basis and it has never fail to work great"}

I checked this out online and found hundreds of comments from owners stating the same thing.  Apparently the pixel thing is so good, that with the bright white screen...it causes burning.  There is no image burn, just a full yellow tint.  This makes it extremely difficult to read books or watch movies on the tablet.\nDespite all the complaints about the issue, nothing is being done.\n\nBuyer beware.  Might look great for awhile, but trouble lies ahead.\n\nWill no long buy Samsung / Google products."}

It operates smoothly, has great color and graphics, connects to the internet without issue, has great speakers, as well as a nice mic and webcam. My issue is that I have had an awful time installing files on this thing. Installing apps and games is child's play. Try installing documents and there comes the issue. I purchased different USB cords, attachments and gadgets and I just can't install my documents on this thing. You can upload them from a computer to google drive but the tablet has to be connected to the internet to open and look at them. After reading about it online I read that I had to install a file manager because the OS doesn't have one. I did that and while I was now able to install my documents about 2 weeks later the documents disappeared from my tablet. I tried installing them from a flash drive, directly from a computer and through email and this tablet just isn't as cooperative as it should be when it comes to this. If you want this to play games, use apps, surf the net and check emails then it is fine. However if you want to use it for more than that then I would be extremely hesitant."}

YouTube, Netflix and many more.\n\nCons\n1. When first used the Nexus 10 it would charge about 20-22% per hour. Now only 8-10% per hour. I wonder why.\n2. Sound on it's own is rather weak. Using Head Phones or on Big Screen TV sound is awesome.\n\nUsing Netflix, HBOGO, Showtime  and Fios Mobile along with YouTube and downloaded movies you have access to over 3000 Movies and videos.

It's not even 1 year old and it has clearly malfunctioned! No physical damage or user error -- I literally use this to watch tv and movies in my home. I'm extremely disappointed in Samsung's customer service. I've spoken to 5 different people and they all have something different to say. For poor customer service and a defective product, I strongly caution anyone considering this purchase!\n\n**UPDATE Feb. 17, 2015** Sent bill of sale from Amazon purchase to Samsung yesterday and they now recognize that I'm still under warranty. However, it still took 4 call transfers to different departments to find the correct one. If you need to call technical support, be specific that you have a NEXUS 10 WIFI-ONLY Tablet. They have separate departments for wifi and networked tablets and they apparently have no idea how to route calls between the two. Finally got 1 competent technician on the phone (after speaking with a total of 9 Samsung customer service reps over the last 3 weeks) who was able to complete my repair order. Sending it out for repairs today, will update when I have final results.\n\n***UPDATE Feb. 26, 20015*** After 1 month, 6 calls, and 18 transfers to different departments, Samsung has closed my repair ticket because this tablet is registered in FRANCE and cannot be covered under their US warranty.\n\nI would absolutely NOT recommend purchasing this product for 3 reasons.\n1) It stopped working after 7 months of basic use\n2) It is not a U.S. Samsung product, and therefore is not covered under their 1 year U.S. warranty, so you will not be able to repair it if it breaks in its first year.\n3) Even if it were covered under Samsung's US warranty, their customer service is the most inept group of people I've ever encountered. They make Time Warner and Comcast look like customer service experts in comparison. I even had the delightful experience of hearing a Samsung customer service rep talk about an explicit sexual act with someone she worked with when she hadn't realized I'd picked up her call.\n\nFrom top to bottom, my least favorite purchase and product of all time."}

The new Nexus 10 was expected to be released at Christmas 2013, - it never happened, a year later the press had stopped talking about the expected new release so I bit the bullet and bought a Nexus 10 in Nov 14.\n\nWhen the tablet arrived my first disappointment was the state of the packaging, the outer box looked as if it had been kicked around a factory floor.\nI also noted that the tablet's box has a seal that clearly states \"Do not accept if seal is broken\", and you guessed it, the seal was broken.\nThe third disappointment was that despite having bought from a company called New Heights Products (NO TAX anywhere), an additional 50 had been added to my bill to cover UK import tax.\nWhen I complained through Amazon I was told I could return it or receive a 40% discount (I suppose I should have realised at this point that I had in fact received a second hand item (despite it having been sold as new)\n\nI opted for the discount, charged the unit up and switched on. After many Android updates, I got around to trying to load movies onto the Nexus.\nI spend a lot of time travelling and one of my main reasons for wanting a 10 tablet was so that I could watch movies while in transit. I was aware that the Nexus didn't have an external micro sd card slot, but I had bought the 32gb version of the Nexus so I thought I would just be able to load films into the nexus memory.\n\nWhat a disappointment this was, First I had to get a USB adaptor so that I could plug in a pen drive  not just any adaptor, it had to be an OTG (ON THE GO) adaptor. The first and second adaptors I bought didn't work despite being advertised as OTG.\nThen I had to load a file viewer App  (youd think the Nexus would have come with a file viewer), then another App called Nexus Media Importer. Well Nexus Media Importer isn't entirely straightforward , well not to me anyway. I got it working after an hour or so, but couldn't face going all through this procedure every time I wanted to watch one of my films on my tablet.\n\nIn the week or so that I had the unit working I've had several freezes and rebooting due to who knows what. In one instance I was listening to a mp3 file when the Nexus decided it wanted to download a newer version of Android.\nI must say that also I couldn't get on with Android 5.0.1 (I think it was) in this version my gmx email account is merged with my gmail account and all my emails appear mixed together. I couldn't find a way of stopping this from happening. - Most annoying.\n\nAnother concern was that all access (including charging the device) is carried out using the micro USB port which didn't seem to be very robust, both the usb to pendrive adaptor and the charging cable waggled about in the socket and I found that if the device was moved while connected the plug frequently fell out.\nSpeaking of the charger, it came fitted with a US style mains plug. Fortunately I had a phone charger that fitted, nevertheless if a company is selling to the UK they should supply the correct charger plug.\n\nThe WiFi side of the tablet all worked fine and the video and audio was good, it was just that for me, what let the whole thing down was the lack of an external micro SD card, and the slack usb socket.\n\nWhen I contacted Amazon their customer services were (as always) very helpful and very professional, I posted the Nexus back to the US on 2nd Jan, the postage cost me 25.\nIt took about 3 weeks for the package to be returned and for me to get my refund, and when I did, they didn't refund the full tax or the cost of my postage. I emailed amazon and within 24hours they had refunded 30 tax and an additional 19 goodwill refund, thereby giving me a TOTAL refund.\n\nOnce again I was extremely happy with Amazon Customer Services  they couldn't have been more helpful\n\nNo doubt it will be resold as new and someone will be very happy with it.\n\nI now have a 10\" Samsung Galaxy Tab, its amazing and seems to me to be several generations in advance of the Nexus."}

Sure, it's not the more advanced tablet these days, but it's rock solid. And, being directly from google, it has very little bloatware."}

Once you've won that war, if you keep power-hungry widgets like weather apps out of the way you will be very happy.  I use the device 1-2 hours each day (usually light actions like browsing the web and checking email), and I have to charge it about once a week.\n\nStill a great option in its class, even though technology is marching on."}

I find the tablet very useful when I want to quickly check something because it is so much faster than waiting for my laptop to boot up, something I do several times per day. Several Android updates have already arrived, one of which caused my extensive bookmarks pages to disappear which had me frustrated until I found a Nexus-users blog where others had the same experience and explained that the Sync function needed to be turned on. Once I did that the bookmarks reappeared, the other updated functions are working fine too. The battery life seems to be shorter than advertised, I use the tablet mainly for financial reports and other reading material which don't include audio, and I don't watch movies, yet the battery is down near the empty level after about 3 hours. So I simply keep it charging a couple of times per day which is no problem. The camera optics are really good and I take a lot of pictures with it, I bought a $10 case and attached an old camera strap so I can hang it on my shoulder when walking around sites I want to photograph on trips. The only problem is that it won't let me email data-intensive things like videos as the files are large. This tablet has higher screen resolution than most others which makes for very nice graphics on the screen. It's a 5 star unit."}

With it being less then a year I figure it has to be covered by the manufacturers warrantee.  I call Amazon, they forward me to the seller Worldwide Distributors THEN they forward me to Samsung!  Now on the phone with Samsung for over an hour, transferred 5 times from sales, to tech support - then to Nexus support, then to CANADA tech support...and now to list the things I find out about my product purchased:\n\n1. It was made in Canada and can only be repaired in Canada (I am from New Jersey!!!).\n2. When the serial number was discovered Samsung stated the manufactures warrantee ended in June 2014!\n3. Amazon is not a licensed seller of Samsung products so this now technically \"voids\" the manufactures warrantee!!!!\n4. I have to go through the extended warrantee I purchased (thank goodness I did that) BUT there is a catch, even if the extended warrantee covers it I still have to ship this to Canada because no authorized Samsung dealer will want to repair it in the U.S.?!?\n\nSo with that said, I went back to Worldwide Distributors and stated my issue, they pointed straight at Amazon - and vise versa.\n\nI am tired and I am annoyed - this is not what is expected of a Samsung product or service.  So not sure if I got a fluke product BUT either way it isn't cheap.  So if you are going to give this a try I suggest by it from an actual place - legit also.  Someone you can talk to face to face if given issues.\n\n**Lesson learned, I will never buy from this seller OR a product of this kind from \"online\".  Sometimes convenience isn't worth it..."}

Plants vs. Zombies and a few other games ran flawlessly.\n\nI didn't use the camera other than a few test pictures, as I didn't purchase a tablet for that reason, but, it was just \"okay\".\nAnother slight downside that I wish they added was no micro SD card slot for expandable memory. 32 gigs is enough to keep a little bit of data on, but For music/movies its better to stream or use cloud stuff.\n\nI still would recommend this tablet after all this time.

This is my second tablet, after the Motorola Xoom, which I still like very much. The first thing I noticed is the incredible crispness of the screen resolution. Fantastic. The sound is  great, probably because  the  speakers are located on the front  and  with a little  the help from  a Playstore  booster/bass  app. The camera and video are decent  at least  as good or better  than  the Xooms. I'm running Kit-Kat  and  I'm still experimenting with  but  it is smoother than  Jelly-Bean.  The Google+ Photo App is great(check the  Auto-Stories/Auto Awesome  Photo feature)The  Maps,Gps ,Yahoo,Google,Chrome browsers are faster than my Dell Quad-Four Desktop. I played 'Skyfall' side by side with the Xoom and that's how I know what 2560x1200 resolution  is all  about! Now do not worry about the fixed 32 GB internal memory,just  plug an OTG Microusb cable in the port and voila'  another 64GB are available (you can import the external card to ES File Manager and/or  share it wirelessly with your TV with a Nexus Media Share App,about $3.00 or a free Media Share app. WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE and almost caused me to return this tablet  is the battery life and even more so the  charging time .The battery  is huge,but it drains a little too  fast...(I'm  learning how  to save battery resources)....  plus  the  original  Samsung charger is INCREDIBLY SLOW ,about 14 hrs from 0% to full charge. In other words the charging time was twice as long as the play time.  Do not despair! I purchased a 5 V, 3.5 Amp charger from PWR+ ($13.00 at Amazon)  and now the charging time is down to about 6 hrs,45 min  This new adapter will even charge while the tablet is working  but  at a  slower rate. The original Samsung charger  would  actually  loose  battery charge wile  the  tablet was running  .I don't  know why the extra \"Amps\"(from 2A original Samsung  to 3.5A  PWR+)would  make a difference, by reading it  somewhere  the tablet supposedly can only accept 1A.I'll leave this puzzle to some electronic geniuses here . There you have it! I didn't  need another tablet but I'm really enjoying this  Nexus 10. PS they tell me that a Pogo Pin Magnetic Charger is available at Amazon for about $24.00. I would be interested but only for the possibility of  freeing the Microusb Port , also to protect  the port...from  damage. They claim that the Pogo charges 25% faster than the original Samsung wall plug ,but I think that I'm already there. FOUR STARS  because I had buy a different charger. Note this tablet has the Gorilla Corning  Glass screen so lets make FOUR And HALF stars  for that."}

I wanted to get out from under Apple control, so I looked for something that wasn't an iPad.  This looked like a good alternative.\nAlmost a year to the day that I first got it, this tablet died on me and would not start up again.  I started noticing that it was acting up over the last few months.  It kept freezing at random times and Id have to restart it.  Then this started happening almost every time I picked it up.  I like to read on the Kindle App and I noticed the screen had a yellowish blotch on the page when Id be reading.  I thought it was just a shadow or something, but I see now that other reviewers on here have mentioned the same thing. It also would get very hot to the touch after I was reading for a few hours.\n\nAt first, I really loved this device.  The screen was a nice size and extremely sharp.  It was solidly built and easy to use.  But there were a few other quirky things that I didn't care for but I learned to live with.  For instance,  Street View on Google Maps was distorted for some reason.  This is a Google product!\n\nAs many others have mentioned, the battery life is horrible.  It takes a ridiculously long time to charge.  I got into the habit of leaving it on the charger whenever I wasn't using it.  If you put it on the charger while you are using it, it takes even longer.\n\nI called Samsung on Sunday (yesterday) to see about getting my tablet repaired.  I gave one young man all of my information and at the end of our conversation he told me that their computer system was down and he couldn't complete my ticket.  He asked that I call back in an hour or so.\nI called back several hours later and was told that the system was still down.  At that point I went to Costco and purchased an iPad Air.  Apple won back a customer because of this.\nI finally got through to Samsung today and after being interrogated in an accusatory manner about any abuse I might have given my Nexus 10, the woman told me it was still under warranty and e-mailed me a return label and instructions on how to return it.\nIt sounds like it might take several weeks to repair and any info I have on the tablet is going to be erased because it will be reset to factory settings.  Im worried that I won't even get the same one back.  How will I know?  Also, I was warned that if they determine that this device was subjected to extreme temperature changes, liquid spills, etc.  the Warranty will be void and Ill have to pay for repairs.  This did not happen, but it will be my word against theirs if they decide it was subjected to abuse.\nI didn't want to wait until I get the tablet back before I wrote this review.  I want people to be warned  immediately against buying this product.  It is not worth the money.  It has serious flaws and you can't just take it in somewhere to be repaired.\nOnce I get the tablet back, Ill update this review to report on how the whole repair ordeal turned out.\n(By the way,  the first generation iPad that I gave my grandson is still going strong and I'm loving the iPad Air.)"}

After an awful update that Google released in Dec 13, it took them 5 months to come up with an update to make it less buggy.  By buggy I mean regularly freezing, restarting and burning through a full battery in less than 30 hours with minimal use.  After the May 14 update improved the performance, Google released an update a month later which immediately restored the table to the previous buggy ways and it has maintained that performance since.  Still waiting on an update from Google months later and bubkiss.  I've seen numerous posts from other users describing the same issues and crickets from Google.  I've disabled Chrome which was apparently a big problem but the tablet still regularly restarts and now only burns through the battery in about 36 hours, again with minimal use.  Hooray for small victories.  I called Google over the summer about the problem and was told to talk to Samsung because I bought this through Amazon.  Samsung help desk was a joke of a service as I got passed back and forth from their tablet help desk to the WiFi only help desk.  After bouncing around THREE times, I had had enough and hung up.\n\nBottom line, if you want to warm your hands using the processor which always seems to run hot or use it to break a window that is pretty much all I would recommend this thing for.  I hate to say it but the next tablet I buy will be an iPad."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "This tablet is just so-so. I love the Android operating system, the features and functionality are fantastic, especially for Google users and those who also have Android smart phones (seamless integration across platforms and all of the Google systems, really top notch!). The tablet hardware is impressive, the tablet feels solid and well built, the screen is excellent, and speakers also very good for a tablet. However, I've had a number of issues with the performance of the tablet. Web browsing is often slow (I've tried a number of browsers and it doesn't seem to matter), aps will freeze or crash pretty regularly, and the tablet itself freezes and needs to be restarted far more often than it should.\n\nOverall, the tablet is wonderful when it is working properly and I've really enjoyed it. However, the performance problems have been  a major frustration and would keep me from recommending this tablet to others. If you're in the market for an Android tablet, I would recommend considering others over this one."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "Still a solid tablet almost two years after its release. I had previously owned a Nexus 7 (2013), but wanted to upgrade to a larger screen. These models were recently on clearance, so it was very attractively priced. That said, my initial experience with the device was disappointing. The screen did not \"pop\" like my Nexus 7 did. Yes, it's incredibly sharp, but the color accuracy and intensity does not compare to the 7, or the other newest tablets from Apple, Amazon, and Samsung. Blues, in particular, appear washed out, faded, and just off.\n\nWhere the Nexus 10 shines, in my opinion, is under the hood. The hardware may not be the newest, but it is more than sufficient for watching video, surfing the internet, and running productivity software. For instance, it feels quicker and more responsive than my friend's newer (and much more expensive) Samsung Note. The tablet also has a better look and feel than the Samsung. Battery life may not be phenomenal, but I've been able to get around 8 hours of video watching when traveling. Charging is slow with the stock charger, but improves significantly with a Pogo cable.\n\nFor those that need Android for productivity purposes (like myself), this is a solid tablet. You do adjust over time to the screen imperfections, so that shouldn't be a deal breaker. Since there's still no large Android tablet out there worth splurging on, I think it makes sense to buy one of these now and wait to upgrade later."}

And the battery lasts all day and into the next if you don't spend the entire day 3D gaming. The processor and graphics chip are fast enough to handle any and everything you can throw at it, including every version of Project DIVA!  For the price I got it at, I'm happy with the purchase 50 times over! The 32GB holds everything I need it to and still has space for more, and it is so SMOOTH!

No added programs from your phone company that you can't get rid of / can't uninstall.\n\n2) If there are Android updates, you get them immediately, not months late when your phone company figures out if it will break any of their proprietary bloatware or not.\n\n3) The build is always top notch, high quality.\n\nThis Nexus 10 for example, is a little heavier than some others I've owned, but when you use it for a while you figure out why. It's built strong. There is no flex in the case. It has the nice rubberized feel, that after 6+ months is showing no signs of wear. The metal grilles over the stereo speakers have from what I can tell a perfect fit, with zero tolerance. The power and volume buttons are small, and ever so slightly raised so you can still feel them, but not so bulky that they get easily hit accidentally. The buttons have very little play in them. The jacks still feel strong after 6 months and have very little play in them. The battery is excellent, easily a whole day on a single charge probably more like 3. (I always plug it in at night)."}

(A lot of people posting said that when they contacted Samsung for support, the had to return the device to have the accelerometer replaced. Ugh! I was dreading shipping the device for repairs, and fortunately, I resolved the problem. The fact that I didn't find clear troubleshooting steps for what seems like a relatively common problems makes me worry that Samsung support doesn't really understand what's causing the problem.) After following some advice on line including downloading software to recalibrate the accelerometer and clearing the cache, I finally restored the functionality by letting the device discharge completely and recharging it. To be honest, I don't know if the procedure caused the functionality to return. I suspect that the auto-rotate stopped working because I had kept the device in an upright position for a couple of weeks, and maybe the physical orientation caused some kind of problem in the interaction of the software and the hardware. In discharging and recharging the device, I left it flat for around a week, and I suspect that leaving the device flat changed the behavior of a sensor and caused auto-rotate to begin working again. I just don't know."}

I like the Google Nexus 10 (Wi-Fi only, 32 GB) for its screen's HD aspect ratio, the apps available (with one major, major exeception), the virtual keyboard, price, etc.  Those are all 5-star features, but WHY DOES AMAZON SELL AN ANDROID MACHINE OF SUCH QUALITY THAT WON'T PLAY AMAZON PRIME SHOWS AND MOVIES?  IT SEEMS LIKE A CRAZY OR LAZY DECISION FOR AMAZON NOT TO DEVELOP AND DISTRIBUTE AN ANDROID APP THAT WILL SHOW AMAZON PRIME CONTENT ON THIIS GOOGLE NEXUS 10.  I have to revert to my Roko set top box pluged into my older Sony TV or my newer Sony TV with Netflix and Amazon Prime configurable on it.  Or I have to dig out my old iPad One or my iPhone.  The Roko box and the Sony TV interfaces are lame for searching for a category by list, actor, in fact, anything but the Title.  The old iPad  is slow and stalls to recover its buffer a lot and the iPhone is very small screen.  Yes, a Google search turns up many schemes to play Amazon Prime on this Nexus 10, but they no longer work because of changes by Google, Adobe and Amazon.  The second flaw is new with the update to android kitkat 4.4.3.  Many messages notifying me that email has stopped as well as other applications.  They seem to restart but it's annoying."}

I was lucky to grab one of these in the first bunch produced.  I love the device and use it all the time.  But.. In the past 2 or 3 weeks I have noticed a yellowing of the previously beautiful white background in a band running from top to bottom of the screen in portrait mode.  The left 10% and the right 20% of the display is the old pure white, but the rest is becoming an ugly yellow.  This has developed rather quickly, and I am seeing a few mentions of display issues on the web.  I am a very experienced reliability engineer and this looks like a classical reliability wearout problem which will probably grow quickly into a headache for the manufacturer and Google as the shipped volume ages.  Be cautious about purchasing one of these or related units (Nexus 7?) until Samsung or Google can assure you that they have found and fixed the problem.  By the way, my Nexus 10 is out of warranty now.  I am giving this a 1 star review to get your attention.  Otherwise it's a 5."}

On the Nexus 10, the home bottom was a digital home button and was always located bottom center and the back button right next to it so you always knew where it was... no matter if you held it landscape, portrait, or even upside down. Again, with the Note 10 you have to locate it (meaning there is a physical home button that's permanent and if you hold your tablet in a certain way, for instance upside down landscape, the home button is now at the top...or portrait mode.. now it's on the left...  upside down portrait mode.. now it's on the right.... I feel that function is kind of a downgrade for me).  Also with the Nexus 10, a visually pleasing pop up keyboard would appear whenever you needed to type and the screen would shift/shrink to allow the keyboard to fit and it was visually pleasing (you could see everything on screen including the keyboard and what you were typing).  It would disappear after you hit enter.  With the Note 10, a mini keyboard pops up and it just hovers over the screen and doesn't go away...sometimes it hovers over what you are currently typing....and you will have to move it to another part of the screen.... how annoying!!!\n\nI hope I warm up to the Note 10 a little more.

The ipad's screen broke due to a drop so it was time to switch things up.  I was very excited for my son to get his hands on the nexus mainly for the many free apps.  The battery charge of this Nexus is agonizingly slow.  So much so I'm thinking about returning it.  It is the worst recharge I've ever had.  Keep in mind I've had a lot of android items as well as an ipad to compare.  This is hands down the worst on the market.  I'm sure I'll get a bunch of hater comments but after some research on the subject that just isn't really any argument, especially compared to iPads lightning fast charge times.  We have found ourselves on constant charging alert.  If it's not plugged in overnight (8-10 hours) forget about playing with it the next day.  I can't complain about any of the features, heck it's android.  If you want an operating system review go somewhere else.  This is a device review.  And for me this device serves no purpose without quality battery life/charging time.  I feel like I need a backpack of batteries to keep this thing alive.  If it allowed me to swap batteries I would literally buy 4 of them.  But you can't.  So we're stuck.  I hope they make some adjustments soon.  I really do love android.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "The main reason I purchased the Nexus 10 was the higher end specifications for its price point. But I was disappointed to find a slew of major issues running the latest Android OS (v4.4.3 as of writing). Look a little deeper than the fanboy reviews and you will find a number of widespread issues with this tablet, many with no apparent fixes. This indicates fault in the tablet hardware, drivers, and/or Android OS implementation. The main issues are:\n\n*Poor web and PDF rendering performance (I tried every browser and reader available, some performance tweaks available in Cyanogenmod help but still less fluid than older/lowerend devices like the iPhone 4 and iPad 2)\n\n*Switching application focus causes original app to reload when switching back, losing your place in file and web browsers (i.e. overzealous memory management even when free RAM is available)\n\n*Short battery life, ~4 hours of use, but at least that much to fully recharge (better be near an outlet if you forget to charge overnight)\n\n*Numerous stock apps like Google Maps drain battery by running in background (fixed with Greenify app)\n\n*Touchscreen exhibits poor responsiveness making it more difficult to select text and even type with the on screen keyboard compared to the older iPhone 4 and iPad 2\n\n*Both built-in cameras are awful, giving out of focus, grainy pictures (somewhat fixed by the CameraFX app but focusing, flash, and resolution still sub-par compared to my older free no-brand cell phone)\n\n*Auto-brightness is essentially non-functional, always requiring manual adjustment. How can Google ignore such a simple yet important feature when Apple nailed it such a long time ago?\n\n*Daily random reboots\n\nThe last was mostly fixed by the 3rd party ROM CyanogenMod, which is updated daily. Unfortunately, random reboots still occasionally happen and CyanogenMod introduced a few new issues like the constant error \"theme provider has stopped working\" popping up 10-15x/day and the lock screen always stuck in landscape even if you are in portrait orientation, forcing you to awkwardly unlock sideways.\n\nYou would think years after its release Google would have most of the issues fixed and a polished product. Yet their priorities appear to be elsewhere as they only release Android OTA updates a few times a year. Overall, I'm very disappointed with the $300+ I dropped on this tablet to get a product that works like its still in beta testing. My confidence in Google to put out a quality consumer product is now non-existent.\n\nToo bad Apple has control issues and locks down iOS like they own your life. I would switch but would miss all the customization possible with rooting. If considering a tablet I would recommend holding out until Apple chills out a bit with limiting customization (if this is important to you), or until the Android OS matures a bit, or even checkout other tablet manufacturers on the Android platform that may have better custom implementations."}

Then some days it charges overnight, others, nope. Last three days, not doing a thing. It's sitting on the shelf right now charging, has the charge icon going and everything, but will it charge today?\n\nHmm I wonder.

Yes it has the best screen out there but all that flash is horsedoo if you can't see it. I would at this point in my experience buy another tablet brand and give google time to either fix it or get out of the tablet market.

I called Amazon's customer support, and I was told the second time that Amazon probably cuts them open to check that everything is in the box. That's ridiculous. I've never heard of a retailer opening brand new items to make sure the unopened box has verything in it. I personally think that this is just a line of bull (I've bought a lot of electronics from Amazon that arrived unopened), but I was told that there is no way to find out whether sellers are just selling opened products as new or Amazon is cutting them open for some stupid reason. So, long story short, this is probably a wonderful device (I'm going to go buy one directly from Google - I'l pay a bit more, but it will be NEW and UNOPENED), but don't buy it form Amazon. Their customer service is either totally wrong (and the sellers are responcible) or they are total idiots on this one (because opening the box an expensive electronic device comes in automatically reduces the worth/resale value of the item, and, in some cases, could void the warranty). Either way, save yourself a headache and buy an UNOPENED one from a reputable seller. LFMF"}

The battery life on mine is likely reduced to old age but not that bad. Don't know if it's the environement or frequency of charging. I tend to use it in  average room temperature whatever that means.. Not too hot, not too cold.

Each one came with English writing on the box sleeve but German documentation inside. Returned them both and awaiting my fourth unit. Original unit was for French customers. All three units received came from different supplier. Patience is wearing thin. My guess is that Samsung is no longer making the Nexus 10 and suppliers are grabbing whatever inventory they can and shipping it out hoping the buyer doesn't check the warranty info. The Nexus 10 itself is still a great tablet and if you can get one destined for the USA, it is a good buy. [Original review follows]\n\nI bought this tablet on Amazon for a good price. The nexus 10 rates 5 stars for its design and function IMHO.However, the 3rd party vendor WEB OFFERS was really bad and dropped my overall score to 4 stars. Tried the tablet out anyway(see below) and am very pleased with it. Screen is great (both touch and detail), but is a magnet for finger prints. It is also very fast. It came with Android 4.2 fast so had to go thru hassle of upgrading to Kit Kat. I recommend this tablet for both form and function. I was tempted to get a Galaxy Tab 3 for less $, but am glad I didn't. However, the market place for Nexus 10 accessories where I live is pitiful. Loads of Ipad stuff and Tab 3 too. So be aware that you many want to buy your cover and screen protector (recommended) when you get your tablet. I ended up doing it after-the-fact.\n\nNow the bad. The tablet came in a box with a sleeve that had French writing on it, the box seals broken and no manual Inside. I figured that WO had extra French tablets and just removed the French startup manual. Anyway, Everything that was needed was included and the unit looked new. I didn't require a manual as I already own a Nexus 7 so startup was no problem. In any event I emailed WEB OFFERS for further guidance and 5 business days later still no response. Today I called Samsung to check on registering the tablet and find out about warranty. SURPRISE - the serial number on my unit shows up as a made for France product. Duh! One year warranty is the same BUT if I need to use it I have to send the unit back to France for repair. Others take note if you received you unit in non-USA packaging.\n\nImmediately called Amazon and am sending the Nexus 10 back and getting another one in replacement that is made for USA distribution. Amazon said they've had many complaints about WEB OFFERS and inventory issues and removed them as a3rd party vendor. Unfortunately to late for me and I see others as well. AMAZON very good WEB OFFERS terrible.\n\nWill update when I've had the new tablet a month or so."}

I use my device mainly for reading my college textbooks but also for playing games and occasionally surfing the web.  The screen size and display is much better suited for text books.  Also I like the cheaper apps on the android market place.  There are some things the the ipad has over the android device but that is mostly just because some developers make it that way.  Of course there are plenty of things the android has over the ipad.  My main concern when I bought the Nexus was the battery life.  I loved the battery life on the ipad and was worried that the Nexus would be sub par.  It is really not the issue that I thought it would be; in fact if I didn't know the specs I wouldn't be aware of the difference in a day to day real world but I am not too detailed orientated.  I can read my assignments and if I skip a day in the charger (even two) I can still do what I need to do.  I would more than accept a slight performance hit for a much better reading display anyway.  Not much more of a hit though, I draw the line here and no further.  I am speaking to you Google and Apple; now play nice."}

But I believe it is relevant now if you are thinking of buying this Google Nexus tablet from Amazon, because third party are the only ones selling it at this time. That being said, DO NOT BUY FROM THIRD PARTY. I was highly skeptical of buying this tablet from Lemrak Sales or any third party seller. I make it a rule to buy only from Amazon directly for this very upsetting reason. Upon receiving the tablet, I saw that the tablet's box has a seal that clearly states \"Do not accept if seal is broken\", and guess what? Yep, the seal was broken. No hesitation, Instant return. I do not care what the item looks like, once the seal is broken, the item is no longer New. The big big point here is that Amazon NEEDS to do something to stop these third party sellers sending defective items, used items that they claim are new, etc. To receive a used item sold as new by a third party seller is disappointing, frustrating and annoying."}

The charger included in the box was not made for use in the U.S. The plug was some weird 2 prong thing obviously meant for somewhere else. We found a different USB charger at home and charged it overnight. 8 hours later the battery meter showed 49% charged. (I also bought a Pogo charger that others recommended. It hasn't arrived yet so i cant comment on whether it helps.) I took the tablet to work and finished charging tablet 4 hours later using phone USB charger in my work truck.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "After owning two iPads, I decided to take to switch to an Android tablet.  However, I wanted a true alternative to the iPad, and based on what I had seen out of Samsung's devices, I knew the Galaxy line wouldn't be for me.  After reading several reviews of the Nexus 10, I decided to take the plunge.  I've now owned it a year.  Thoughts, in no particular order:\n\n- The screen, while excellent, isn't as vibrant as the Retina Display.\n- Battery life is decent.  It doesn't last as long as the iPad, but you'll squeeze several hours of heavy Internet surfing out of it.  If forced to guess, I'd say you could watch a couple of two-hour movies from beginning to end on a single charge.\n- Widgets really are very handy.  This is an area where Android definitely has iOS beat, hands down.  It is very handy to have my email and social media updates on a single screen.  Sooner or later, Apple just has to embrace some version of this.\n- The Swiftkey keyboard is very useful.  The predictive text and suggested terms get more accurate over time.  Beats Apple's autocomplete without breaking a sweat.\n- Another selling point: the dual speakers make the Nexus 10 degrees of magnitude louder than the iPad.\n- A few months after I bought it, I sprung for a Pogo charger.  Nice to have, but when the tablet is in a protective case, it has to be opened completely to access the magnetic charge area.  Hardly a dealbreaker, but it will leave the device exposed when charging.\n- It was heavier than the iPad upon its release, and with the release of the iPad Air, this thing looks and feels like a tank.\n- It's a hassle not to have some data plan version available.  If I'm not near a wifi hotspot, it just feels two steps removed from a paperweight.  Amazing that, nearly two years after its release, Google still hasn't struck a deal with one of the wireless companies.\n- Sorry, but Android just isn't as polished, as fast or as stable as iOS.  I upgraded to Kit Kat when it came out a few months ago, and I'm pretty compulsive about making sure any patches or updates are installed.  This thing *still* locks up on me at least once a week.\n\nAll in all, it's acceptable, but still a step or three behind the iPad.  I do plan on switching back; I miss the larger, brighter screen, and there are certain apps for school that, unfortunately, aren't available in the Google Play store.  However, if you're committed to dumping Apple no matter the sacrifice, then this will probably fit the bill."}

I've never had any Apple products, but sometimes have desired them. When I purchased the Nexus 10, (and a Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 for my wife), this all changed. The thing I least liked is hardware design, but as soon as you slip it in a case, you forget about it.\n\nWhat's great about it? Speed and the screen. Compared to the Galaxy Tab 2 this thing flies, the 'rendering' of web pages, like amazon, was unnoticed in the Nexus and on the Tab 2 it would take a couple of seconds to show the page and the 'add to cart' button would take 3-4 seconds to react to the click. I have not had a problem of it slowing down or making me wait for something (also a lot faster than galaxy s3). And the screen! Best resolution out there, I saw a 720p video and it looked amazing. I showed it off to family and friends with this video and everybody agreed it looked better than in a 55 inch 1080p TV, it looked smoother and neat-er.\n\nWho shouldn't buy this tablet?

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I bought a refurbished version of this tablet to replace an Apple iPad 2 that was stolen. When it arrived, it was running Android 4.2 and I couldn't get it to update to 4.4. I tried updating manually but I couldn't get that to work either. Eventually I connected it via usb to the computer and it updated automatically at that point. So if you're having trouble updating, try connecting to a computer with the usb and leaving it for a bit; it will probably update OTA (over the air) at that point.\n\nThe tablet was buggy as a box of bees until the upgrade - turned off when put to sleep, youtube, google music, google video all nonfunctioning - but once it updated it was like a new machine. It now works perfectly. The display is gorgeous and it's fairly light for the size; I have a Kindle paperwhite for extensive reading of epubs (which I love), but my eyes aren't great so this tablet's size is terrific for pdfs. Of course, you can't beat it for video or web surfing.\n\nReasons why I love this tablet more than my stolen ipad: 1) lower price for similar specs; 2) can use mini-usb/usb connector to access a flash drive (why are people complaining about the lack of an SD card?); 3) can use apps to customize, particularly being able to dim display all the way down for low-light conditions; 4) compatible with adobe flash, at least in certain circumstances.\n\nI haven't found battery life to be a problem, but it can be improved by turning off bluetooth, GPS (location), and NFC data exchange if you're not using them and dimming the screen.\n\nOverall, performance on the Nexus 10 is fantastic and it compares favorably with the iPad 2 in all respects. It's not the end-all tablet for everyone. The size alone means that smaller 7 or 8 inch tablets would be better for some users in some situations but if you're looking for a lot of screen real estate and don't want to spend a lot of money, this tablet is an awesome alternative to Apple."}

Aside from that this tablet works absolutely beautifully. Definitely worth the price in comparison to other major brands such as the iPad and the galaxy. The high definition resolution screen is so awesome for all those videos Netflix and gaming and everything else that I do on my tablet. Also with the additional storage for the cost, can't be beat. I highly recommend this tablet for anyone in the market for something durable, good looking, without all the additional cost. And I also love the speakers. I mean seriously, I can't get enough of the front facing. The fact that all tablets are made with front facing speakers is just sad but I'm glad the Nexus was able to hit it right on the head."}

I set it to the lowest level, still good enough for indoor use, plus saves battery. of course, don't let the any light above reflects on the screen\n-- for those who are techs and/or pay attention to details, the specs may be confusing. google says it is ARM15 and 2GB ram, but the system only shows ARM7 and 1.1GB. I was worried that the pad has some problem or whatever, but it is not the case.\nthe ram IS 2GB, just that the system reserved 900MB to the display, so only about 1.1GB left. I do hope that I can make it to reserve less. unless you are using some graphic intensive apps, I don't think you need 900MB for it, waste of memory\nfor the CPU, it IS ARM15, only that it doesn't normal show unless you use apps like cpu-z, which shows the CPU architecture. the ARM7 it shown is kernel architecture\n- since it is from google, so you are out of luck on most of the nice samsung features. well, you can get a replacement for multiview, the sidebar, but multi window won't do, only full screen.\n- and, I don't know if it is a new pad, or because of the specs, but the reaction from the pad is pretty fast"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I ordered a Nexus 10 to replace a three year old iPad 2 that I thought was dead (turned out it wasn't). I have a Samsung S3 phone and Chrome is my default browser on my Windows desktop so it made sense to use an Android tablet.\nLike anything, there are pro's and con's:\n\nPro's\nIt was easy to set up. As soon as I signed into my gmail account it automatically synced with my other devices and it copied over my bookmarks. Nice!\nThe screen resolution is amazing. Much better than my iPad.\nFor me at least, it's easier to use than the iPad but I find the iPad to be frustrating at times especially when it comes to file management.\nI was able to print! Doesn't sound like a big deal does it? Well, I have an older Canon printer and as hard as I tried I never could find an app that would allow me to print from the iPad to the Canon. I'd have to send myself an email and then open the email on my desktop and print from there. Not a big deal, but come on! I blame Apple's arrogance for that one.\n\nCon's\nI find it much easier to read the iPad. The Nexus always (ok, almost always) has a black bar on the top and bottom of the screen so it's smaller than it should be.\nMy desktop (Win 7) Chrome has a favorites bar and a home button. Not on the Nexus. I could live with that but the bookmarking on the Nexus is cumbersome. Like I said, my desktop bookmarks were copied over but there's now a series of bookmark folders that I have to navigate through to find what I want. If I change the layout of the bookmarks on the Nexus they get changed on my desktop.\nApps, mostly games, for Android haven't caught up to the iPad. Yes, there are some fine games out there but most of the free games that I found were re-sized versions of the phone game. Why have that terrific resolution if you're not going to use it?\nThe Nexus seemed sluggish compared to the iPad but I thought maybe it was just me. After I got the iPad up and running again I did multiple speed tests on both devices. The iPad was 15-20% faster every time I tested it.\nMy biggest con is the battery and maybe it's just mine. It takes forever to fully charge this thing. It really is an overnight process. It also drains faster than my iPad. Another thing you'll notice is that if you use it while you're charging it, the charge can't keep up with you. And I'm not talking about streaming video, I had this problem playing solitaire.\n\nThe final straw for me was the battery. I had the unit in standby for 24 hours after a full charge. It was completely dead when I went to use it again. This may be a problem with the Nexus I received but that on top of the other negatives resulted in me returning the tablet. I'd still like an Android tablet and I'll keep searching. But, this isn't the one."}

What this seller is likely doing is purchasing these in bulk, opening each package, and swapping the original charge cables for low-quality, replacement cables. The seller then resells the original, factory cables elsewhere for a profit.\n\nDon't get me wrong, besides the fact that the tablet is an international version, the tablet is legitimately awesome. The cables weren't a problem for me, because I have many compatible spares from my past devices.

No lag or delay from needing more processing power or RAM.\nUses Micro USB to charge. No need to get an entirely different set of cables for charging at the office, in the car, at home, etc. Just use same as your phone.\n\nCons:\nSometimes seems to be slight issues with multiple apps using bandwidth as if there is a bandwidth cap on the device itself. Not sure if this is a App issue or hardware.\nOccasionally I'll get a random reboot of the device with no warnings. This will occur every few days. Not sure if it is hardware or App related.\nMy hand will often cover the lens responsible for adjusting the backlight brightness causing the screen to be very dim.

You will not find the (Samsung) Google Nexus 10 in their list of products, and there is no manufacturer support information for it.\n\nIf you go to the Google Play support forums, you will see the broad and intense frustration felt by owners of this product.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I put 5 stars because this is a great tablet...just not the one I ordered from amazon. This seller gets ONE STAR! I had read a lot of reviews that people wrote about the factory seals being broken when they ordered from Electronics Warehouse, so I ordered mine from H&H Headphones...another seller fulfilled by amazon.  Not only were the seals broken but the screen protector that comes on the tablet looked like someone ran it over.  I turned it on just to see and it was so slow and would not stay connected to my Wifi. I called amazon right away and they sent me a return shipping label.  Thankfully Amazon's wonderful customer service made the return easy but I would rather they didn't back up these kind of sellers so I didn't have to be so disappointed upon opening my Nexus that I was so excited to get.  I ended up buying it in a store so I paid about 50 bucks more...but it was worth the peace of mind that nobody messed with my tablet or tried to root it or anything that would make it less then it is capable of.\nWATCH OUT FOR THESE SELLERS.\n\nNOW ABOUT THE TABLET....definitely 5 Stars!\nThis tablet is amazing.  It is stock android, exactly what Android is intended to be. There is absolutly no lagging or stuttering. The screen is sharp and the speakers are the best I have heard on a tablet. Its got the latest updates, its not overloaded with bloatware and preloaded apps, so it runs very quick and smooth. It also is very comfortable to hold. I thought i wouldnt like the larger bezel but it actually makes holding the tablet and not hitting things on the screen much easier. The onscreen menu buttons are great, they turn when you turn the tablet so you always know where to hit.  Unlike the galaxy tabs where you either hit the buttons by accident or you have to look for them depending on the orientation you are holding the tablet. I had a Galaxy Note 2014 edition and besides the very pretty screen and the S pen (if that's what you need) this tablet has so much more to offer. I returned the Note because it had a horrible lag and I couldn't stand it.  Touchwiz really slows things down. Never mind the 600 dollar price tag.\nSo for anybody that has read bad reviews on the nexus 10 I would take into consideration that the person that wrote it may not have got a Brand New Factory Sealed Nexus 10, but instead one that someone messed around and maybe tried to root and didn't know what they were doing and then returned it. Who knows...but I do know I love mine, and over a year and half since its release this tablet is still one of the best."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I searched around for a tablet so I could phase out my laptop, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I researched around and it came down to either this tablet or the Samsung Galaxy Note. Seeing that this had almost the same specs as the note but with less bloatware, I decided to buy it. I quickly found it doesn't really compare to having a real computer.\n\nThe battery life at first was abysmal lasting around just a few hours, but after tweaking the settings it will last for days. It was a singular event but during the first week using it, the battery went from 45% to 0% in around 5 seconds. I contacted google and they were very helpful. Every now and then though, I do get random restarts, or an app with completely freeze and will require a complete shut down and restart.\n\nCharging is very slow. I would plug it in at 50% battery and leave it plugged in overnight to find that it was only at about 88% in the morning. I purchased a POGO cable and it made a dramatic difference in the charging rate.\n\nI didn't find out till after I purchased it that the new android software doesn't support flash player. It's not a huge problem but it is a pretty big annoyance that I can't watch simple videos (like Vines, Amazon instant video, or pretty much anything that isn't on youtube). There are ways to get around it but it seems to be more trouble than it's worth. Had I known, I probably wouldn't have purchased the tablet. At this point, my Nook HD has more functionality than the Nexus 10.\n\nThe tablet is pretty fast and works really well. A big problem is that i can't change document properties. I'm an electrical engineering student and I bought the tablet so that i can take and view class notes. The problem comes from my professors, since they are kinda old they accidentally label their notes \"chapter 1.notes pdf\" and the tablet won't recognize the format. It's a simple fix but I have to wait till I get home late at night and use my desktop to make the simple change to the label.\n\nAll being said, it IS a good tablet. It just doesn't seem to be do what I had been hoping it would."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "Why I got this:\nBefore getting this, I had gotten and returned a Chromebook and Windows 8 hybrid laptop. The Chromebook was close to being something that I would keep, but Windows 8 convinced me that Microsoft is egotistical and out of touch. So, I decided to stick with Android. My goal was to have something that I could take to the coffee shop with me or just use around the house. I wanted something that was good enough to almost serve as a laptop without getting into any heavy tasks (gaming, video editing etc).\n\nWhat I like:\nThe screen is beautiful. Of course this is the major reason most people get the Nexus 10. Even almost 2 years since it's release, the screen sharpness measured in pixels per inch is higher than many new tablets coming out. I love the the ability for multiple user accounts! I can lend my tablet to someone without them having to see my private files or  risk having them install stuff I personally do not want. This is especially a handy work around to running the tablet for 2 modes (work and personal). I like the big bezels, because it actually is practical on a 10 inch tablet. I can hold this with both hands having a place to rest my thumbs. The material on the back really nice. There mostly isn't any unnecessary bloatware considering that most users will want to install many Google applications. Nexus also gets the latest updates, which I appreciate a lot. Even when Google stops supporting this, I will be able to easily root and continue upgrading this.\n\nWhat I don't like:\nThe android OS really isn't 1 size fits all. I have the same OS (Kit Kat) on my Nexus 7 (2013) and my Galaxy S4. It works beautifully on these devices, but isn't well suited for a 10 inch tablet. Google could have easily worked around this issue by giving users the ability to change the location of the software keys (multitasking, home, back). Instead, I have to constantly change the position of my hands to awkwardly reach for the multi tasking button.\n\nI don't care what reviewers say, this thing is laggy. There will be many times I get lag when just switching programs or between screens. My Touchwiz Galaxy Note 2 running earlier versions of android is much smoother than the Nexus 10. It simply doesn't go as fast as I think it should have.\n\nWould I buy it again:\nNo, unless I got it for 70 to a hundred bucks cheaper. For the 10 inch and higher tablet space, I think the ASUS Transformer has the best Idea. I ultimately chose this unit for its price and the hope that I could emulate the transformer by later buying add ons (keyboard, mouse, etc). I have hooked up a mouse and keyboard to the nexus 10, and it really isn't that intuitive to navigate.\n\nThere will probably be a better and updated version in the future. I think the Nexus 10 should have eliminated the flash back facing camera and vibration to focus on performance issues. After getting the superior Nexus 7 from Asus, I had a lot of buyer remorse about buying this tablet, and I am looking for ways to use it."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I bought this to use alongside the iPad 3 I've had for a while, so here's a quick comparison of those two products:\n\n- Performance of the Nexus seems good, perhaps the best available on the Android platform based on the comparison shopping I did. However, scrolling is frequently choppy, so the iPad performance seems better.\n\n- The look and feel of the Nexus is quite nice. I love the grippy, rubberized material and the rounded shape. It makes the iPad look \"square,\" literally and figuratively. But when I actually use the devices, I much prefer the 4:3 aspect ratio of the iPad screen. It's more practical for reading books, reading email or browsing the web and only slightly narrower for wide-screen movies.\n\n- The forward-facing speakers on the Nexus are a great idea, but they don't actually sound that good to me -- too tinny. The iPad speaker gives a fuller sound.\n\n- The iPad requires an iTunes account for some features, but the Nexus apparently requires a Google account just to turn the device on. I haven't researched this and there might be a way to disconnect -- I don't like essentially being \"logged in\" to Google for everything I do.\n\nBottom line, if you want an Android tablet, I think this is an excellent choice, but if you're open to either platform, I'd recommend an iPad."}

Geer up my cool HD weather app, find out when the bus is coming and check my emails, zip, zip, zip. Works great as a reader--syncs perfectly with adobe and kindle, drive whatever! Great for reading on the couch or in bed--I think I actually prefer it to a real book--lighter and I prefer scrolling over page turning. Also, Google now has a voice search function like Apple Siri--Blows the Ipad away imo. Resolution is better, it's much cheaper and it perfectly syncs with all your Google accounts out of the box. This tablet shows just how awesome Google has become. And I love that they update it with the latest Android OS automatically unlike other Android tablets.\nIt's super fast, user friendly and fun! I think anyone could learn to use this device in just a few hours.\nBtw, don't try Candy Crush on this device--you will get addicted fast! Games look awesome and this baby never lags. Videos, what? I can plug this into my HDTV with an HDMI and mini USB adapter and stream TV or anything on the internet without a hitch--and the colors and graphics are amazing. I really can't tell any quality difference. I am also using this with Chromecast now and loving it, works great. The speakers in front are surprisingly good quality, the sound is excellent with headphones, music and videos stream and sound superb.\n\nThis tablet is great for busy college students like me who don't want to carry around a heavy notebook but still want to look things up, schedule assignments or check emails. The only cons are that you need a wireless network and it's not conducive to any kind of heavy typing (unless you're a texting master), I don't use it for writing except small email responses. I have found a stylus helps significantly. As for wireless everywhere, I can't afford that service anyway--use it at home and school only where internet is avail. If I need to get online elsewhere I can just use my cell phone. Of course it's not a laptop so these things are expected although you can buy wireless keyboards to go with the Nexus--I tried one company and found that I preferred a stylus because the wireless keyboard made it too heavy and cumbersome (not why I wanted a tablet). I have a 3 lb notebook for when I need that.\nBuy this tablet--you won't be sorry!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "This comment is about the seller, not the Nexus 10. I like the pad so far.\n\nThe problem is that the seller sent the German version rather than the English. The box had all the information and marketing in German. This would have been fine with me, but the charger was for a European outlet. The plug portion of the charger is actually removable, and I assume the American plug would fit right in. Unfortunately there was no alternate American plug, and I can't find one anywhere.\n\nWe called Amazon to complain and they gave us a $25 credit to buy a Pogo magnetic cable which supposedly charges faster. This is a great deal, but unfortunately the Pogo cable says to use the charger that came with the pad. I have many USB chargers scattered around the house, but none are the 5 volt/2 amp used by the Nexus 10 and they charge very slow (I assume they'll still be slow with the Pogo cable).\n\nSo I ordered a 5V/2A charger for $10. If this works, I'll still come out ahead, getting the Pogo cable for essentially $15 instead of $25. But I'd still like to have the original charger with an American plug. If you're in the United States, you might want to consider buying the Nexus 10 from a seller that has the American version."}

One of the things that drew me to this choice were the front facing speakers, a rarity on a tablet. And that was one of my first disappointments. While the audio is fine on games and other media, the audio volume for the videos I stream via Netflix and my Xfinitey provider is extremely low, almost to the point where I can't hear dialog without either getting real close or plugging in headphones.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "After a considerable amount of research, I bought this tablet as a replacement for my old desktop.  I also purchased a 24\" widescreen TV, a video HDMI cable adapter, a logitech bluetooth keyboard, a microsoft bluetooth mouse, a micro usb OTG cable and a POGO cable charger.  First the good.  When I first turned on the tablet, it quickly took me through the steps of customizing the system for my connections.  It downloaded all of the apps that I am using on my android phone and connected me with my google account.  The screen is awesome - very sharp and responsive.  The tablet is responsive.  The tablet quickly had me update my android software to the latest 4.4.2 android release.  A particular use for the tablet was to perform the digitization of my large LP collection.  I found a replacement in the app store for the famous audacity desktop sound mixing software - Audio Evolution Mobile and a USB Audio Recorder app for interfacing to a USB audio device.  I was able to interface to my Rega Fono Mini phone preamp/analogue to digital converter through the USB port using this driver.  I am now happily converting my LP's to wave files with this app and then converting them to MP3's for listening on my digital devices.  I also downloaded the Kingsoft Office and the AndroOpen Office apps for microsoft compatible wordprocessing, spreadsheets and powerpoint editing and creation.  I found an app to perform automatic synchronization with my dropbox account of select folders on the nexus and also an app that would mount a memory stick for read/write access.  Finally, I found an app that would allow me to print to my wireless brother printer which was not compatible with the included google cloud print or HP Print Service app.  In addition to several other apps that I use for various asundry things, I basically had everything I needed to perform the basic functions I had been doing on my old desktop plus I now had tremendous mobility and flexibility.  I have been quite happy with all of this.  I purchased the tablet when google and amazon dropped the price on the tablet by $50 in order to clear out their remaining inventory.  I don't believe you can find the 32 Gbyte version available from either amazon or google now.\n\nNow the bad.  The tablet charges extremely slowly.  I had read beforehand that the POGO cable charger would charge the tablet much faster than the included USB charger.  However, it has proven to be only marginally faster.  If the tablet becomes fully discharged, plan to take the entire night to recharge the tablet to full capacity.  In addition, there are times when I have been using the tablet while it is charging and still lost ground on the available charge on the battery!  However, when fully charged, I can usually get about 6 - 8 hours of use by keeping the screen turned down to a reasonable level and adjusting the synch rates of google mail and other services.  Another problem is the bluetooth system.  I cannot have the wifi (2.4 Ghz) up and connected while using both the bluetooth mouse and keyboard simultaneously.  The keyboard kind of goes haywire.  If I disconnect the bluetooth mouse and instead use a usb mouse (or no mouse), everything is ok.  If I disconnect wifi, I can use both the bluetooth mouse and keyboard without a problem.  Some investigation on the internet revealed that this is a problem on nexus devices going back to Android 4.2 when Google introduced an entirely new bluetooth \"stack.\"  It appears that they have not been able to fix this problem.  A few times, I have had a random reboot.  I have probably suffered a random reboot about half a dozen times in the two months I have been using the tablet.\n\nOverall, I have to say the experience has been positive.  I would give this tablet 4 or 5 stars if the serious bugs I mentioned above did not exist.  However, I am still going to keep the tablet for the foreseeable future."}

I also bought him a JAM wireless bluetooth speaker which was so easy to pare to this tablet.  6. I also bought him a bluetooth wireless keyboard and a stand for this exact model tablet and he loves the whole package!!!!\nThe only thing I regret is that I may have created a monster.

I tried out several windows tablets at a local store and they crashed on me! Hmmm. Not very promising. So I read many many reviews on Amazon and it seemed that the Nexus 10 was the most reliable and the one that would allow me to do everything I want it to do..  I have not yet plugged it into my desktop to download my Itunes, however, it can be done. I really like watching movies on this screen.  Its fun to use. It comes with eBook instructions on how to use the tablet.  I'm looking forward to playing with my new toy. The only reason I am not giving five stars is because the instructions are too basic. I hate to have to look around on android forum sites to learn simple things, like using the clipboard.  So, hear that, Google?

Like this it's 32 GB.  The resolution is supposed to be the same.  It's going to have retina display, but this tablet is easily readable with no eyestrain and my eyesight is pretty bad, even with glasses.  The only difference is going to be in the price and that';s going to be a lot different.  My advice - get these while you still can.  I did spend a few dollars on a male USB to male Micro USB cable so that I can readily transfer files from tablet to computer, something that can be done with with Google Drive, but the five dollars difference gives me additional speed.  You should know that about 5 GB is taken up by formatting, so it's not really 32 GB that you have to work with, more like 27 GB.  The speakers are the best that I've ever heard on a tablet but if you have a good ear, you'll get bored pretty fast.  All in all, this is a great purchase if you want a tablet.  I did.  There's a lot of free goodies on this tablet that would cost you big time otherwise.  I highly recommend ESET antivirus.  I also recommend sticking to Google play for your apps.

Have run into no issues with speed, storage, need to be able to work apps, etc.  Biggest issue I had was I use it for demos at work, and one application we had was IE only.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "This tablet has some great features: beautiful screen, nicely syncs all of my google stuff, very easy to use and setup, whatever. Basically it has everything that a top of the line tablet should have. The performance is also very good in the beginning, with super fast and smooth transitions between apps.\n\nThe problem is that over some time (around 3 months for me) it starts to crash a lot. Basically every time I used the browser, which requires a lot of tapping and using, the tablet would crash and restart. It got worse over time and now it freezes and crashes basically every time I browse the web, which is a few times a week. Its not unusable; I watch YouTube videos all the time on it and it works fine, but I think it's when I'm using the keyboard or clicking a lot of stuff it's like \"oh wait stop that you're going too fa\" and then freezes. There are occasional firmware updates that claim to fix the issues but they always creep back. I've had this tablet for a year now and I would say that I'm ultimately disappointed in it. I feel that I would have gotten a much better product if I spent $100 more on an iPad. Because most people really value stability and reliability in their computer devices above all else, I would advise you to either spend the money and get an iPad or get an Kindle or something that is much cheaper (price-wise) so you don't feel like you wasted much money."}

However, android needs to work on being user friendly. Upon initial boot up of the tablet, it would not connect with my wifi router. After much internet research, I learned is was due to my router security settings: WEP. Once I change the setting to WPA, the wifi connected with no problems. Other small issues have come up that has taken some investigation to resolve. In other words often the user must do more than click an application icon and expect it to function. For example clicking google talk did not allow me to use google hangout to talk with family members. The video camera icon does not automatically show up, so I will need to figure out this feature before using google talk.

Seems to be more than enough room to hold lots of movies and since I can connect it to my PC I can copy them on and off as I want to only keeping the movies I want to watch on the device.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I need to get one thing out of the way up front - the seals on the box were broken (apparently a quite common complaint). I was hesitant to accept the unit so I documented the receipt condition. The unit itself appeared absolutely pristine and brand new. That said I have had no issues with the tablet in the month that i have owned it and plan to keep it barring any irresolvable issues.\n\nI purchased the tablet for media consumption - YouTube, Netflix, sharing photos and videos. I am not using it for work so productivity is secondary for me. The tablet excels at media consumption - Netflix runs perfect, YouTube is great and photos look fabulous. Some have complained about the screen colors being somewhat dull and washed out (compared to an IPad). I have not found this to be an issue at all - movies and photos look more natural as a result. If you need more punch just turn up the screen brightness. The display is drop dead gorgeous.\n\nBattery charging is slow (I did not buy accessory charger) but is quite manageable - I just plug it in overnight every 2-3 days and I'm good to go. I haven't checked battery life but it has not been an issue for me.\n\nPure Android! My tablet immediately updated to 4.3 then 4.4 (now running 4.4.2) and pulled in all my apps from Google Play store without incident. I don't miss the bloat ware!\n\nConnectivity is great - WIFI connects immediately and stays connected. I am able to tether to my RAZR with FoxFi (yes i did purchase the app) and connection speeds are quite fast as I have no trouble streaming YouTube HD when tethered. Also (and this is GREATTT), Roku just released a YouTube app within the last 2 weeks that allows me to 'beam' my YouTube playlist from my tablet to my home theater system. Whatever I punch in on the tablet is now on the home theater.\n\nThis thing is FAST - scrolling is butter smooth, no hiccups, no waiting. The thing just flat out flies! I've had no freezes, crashes or random reboots (I am using dolphin browser - rather than Chrome). It's been rock solid so far.\n\nOne of the things that differentiated this table from the others I was considering is the front facing speakers. They put out a surprising amount of sound (depending on the program material) with a fairly good sound field. I didn't expect a lot of bass and that is the case. The speakers are quite adequate for the job.\n\nI looked at the surface and Asus transformer infiniti. The surface was ruled out on cost and Microsoft does not have the ecosystem that android has (my phone is android RAZR). I am one of the few (apparently) that likes Windows 8 (have 2 Win 8 laptops) but I find it cumbersome to move files from the Windows system to the Android system. So I went with Android based tablet. What turned me off on the Asus was the single rear facing speaker, overpriced, and still running ice cream sandwich. I waited for the price to drop on the Asus for a year and it didn't budge! So when the price dropped on the Nexus 10 I went for it.\n\nI was expecting to be disappointed with the camera - I am not! Granted I have not tested it in difficult lighting (mixed artificial light sources, high dynamic range etc) but what I have seen so far is that the tablet does a good job of getting the exposure and white balance correct. Videos are crisp and well exposed. It won't replace your DSLR (maybe not your smart phone camera either) but nonetheless has proved quite useful and handy.\n\nThat back has a rubbery material which I find a bit slippery in my hands. The tablet is very thin and light. I purchased a Fintie folio and stand combination. It protects the tablet and puts it to sleep when closed. The two make a great combination.\n\nOverall, I really love this tablet - if you don't need it for productivity you can't go wrong with this one."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "This is the first tablet I've ever owned and I am not disappointed.  It's fast, sleek, and everything I'd ever want in a tablet experience.  Various family members have owned numerous generations of the iPad and while it does not always have the reliable, seamless fluidity that the Apple branded products are known for, it's damn near close.\n\nMy only issues are that after prolonged use, the battery heats up tremendously.  You could fry an egg on the back of this thing after 20-30 minutes of normal, non-video-intensive use.  I'm not kidding here.  This thing could double as a hot plate.  Also, the battery life tends to tank if you use it for longer than 30 minutes at a time.  This could be a normal thing that all tablets have, since I'm not too familiar with what is the norm these days for these beefier, more capable devices.  The battery life seems entirely dependent on the temperature that the battery reaches each time I use it.  If I use it for 5-10 minutes and the battery doesn't heat up to temperatures the surface of the sun would be jealous of, I get much more life out of the device per charge than if I would do the same tasks with the tablet for 30 minutes straight, heating up the battery to scalding temperatures.  Does any of that make sense?  I hope so."}

I expected it to be able to do similar functions such as sync music, contacts, calendar, etc. with my computer.  IT CANNOT.  I used Windows Media Player to sync music and found that this device is unable to play WMA format music - which the majority of the CDs that I've ripped were in.  $30 later I found a program to convert the wma's to mp3s and reloaded.  To find out that the Nexus doesn't have a built in app to update album art.  So I find a fee App to do this and have a stream of ads shown to me....unless of course I want to upgrade and buy the commercial free app.  Somewhere along this journey I also found that there is no version of Adobe flash player for this device....bye bye to a good bit of web content!  After realizing it also doesn't have software built in (like my HTC phone) to sync with Outlook, I did some web searching and found another nightmare.  I hit factory reset and gave this piece of junk back.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "Over a period of several weeks I tried out the following.  (I will post this same review in Amazon under each device.)\n\n1. ASUS Transformer T100 hybrid tablet/notebook \n2. Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 Tablet\n3. Google Nexus 10 tablet\n\nI also looked at an iPad Air.  They are way overpriced.  And I still have a grudge against Apple for the 2012 hard drive recall they had on our 27\" iMac.  It was a total disaster.  We didn't lose any data but it took weeks and endless phone calls to get it running right again.\n\nAfter spending a day getting used to Windows 8, I thought the ASUS might be the one I was going to keep.  I actually only tried it for two days.  Early on day three I shut it down only to have it remain on the \"Shutting Down\" screen for an extended time period.  So I powered it off.  Apparently, my bad.  Subsequently it would not reboot into Windows, reset or repair even after talking with ASUS Tech Support.  They asked me to return it to them for repair.  I declined and returned it to Wally World.\n\nI liked the ASUS.  It was attractive but a fingerprint magnet both front and back. And it was more difficult to use than Android.  The two issues that bothered me most were the lack of a Swype app and the complications of dictation.  The best Swype-type app in the Windows Store is TouchPal.  It ain't that good.  First of all the virtual keyboard is large. Your finger has to cover a lot of real estate to enter characters.  Also, the word prediction accuracy sucks. Windows-supported dictation was not that accurate, so I had to go into Google to dictate.  This was not nearly as handy as being in a Google operating system to begin with.  I use Swype and dictation a lot.\n\nThe mentioned issues relate to Windows 8 not the physical unit.  I liked the ASUS unit enough that I discovered they make several similar models running Android.  After checking these out I found they were either running old versions of Android or cost a couple of hundred dollars more than the two Samsung models mentioned here.  So, that ended that.\n\nIt was hard to choose between the Nexus and the Galaxy,  Both are made by Samsung.  I waited several weeks to see if a new Nexus 10 was coming out but to no avail.\n\nAs far as looks go, the Galaxy is very thin and attractive.  In my opinion it is as nice looking as an iPad even though it has more plastic.  I had the white one so fingerprints were not that visible.  The Galaxy gets compliments for its narrow bezels.  However these are really a functional negative. They cause you to touch and activate stuff on the screen accidentally quite often.  Makes me suspect the iPad has the same problem.  There are a lot of complaints about the large area of sensitivity for the three built-in keys at the bottom of the Galaxy.  However I thought this was minor compared to the narrow side bezels.  (You can probably negate the side bezel problem by putting the unit in a folio case. It could give you more to hang onto.) The speakers are on the top of the sides and are easy to cover up when holding the unit.\n\nThough made by Samsung, because Google's name is on it the Nexus is first in line for Android updates. It has already downloaded the latest Android version, KitKat.  It will also be the first to get future updates since there is no manufacturer software OS overlay to wait for.  It is pure Android--no bloatware.  In terms of specs, the Nexus blows the other two units away.  The broad bezels may not be as attractive but they give you something to hang onto without accidental screen touches.  The Nexus' rubber-like coating on the back is better for grip and not a fingerprint magnet.  Less bling but more practical. The Nexus' speakers are on the on the front, the best place.\n\nEven though I did not keep the Galaxy and its specs are much less impressive than the Nexus, I found it perfectly satisfactory for my needs.  I do mainly Web browsing, Email, some text and spreadsheet documents and a few non-graphic intensive games. I bought all of these units from local big box stores.  The Nexus 10 was $400 and the other two units were only about $30 less.\n\nAfter considerable researching of portable Bluetooth keyboards, I ordered and just received a Kensington KeyFolio Pro 2 Universal Case and Keyboard.  I bought this from Amazon and will review it when I have had it for awhile.  So far this looks like a terrific and attractive accessory  I will probably keep the Nexus in the protective case without the keyboard most of the time.  I will use the keyboard when I do a lot of data entry."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I have had this device for about two months, and it is a piece of junk.  I do not recommend it to anyone.  I am about to go back to iPad, or maybe to a Windows tablet.\n\nI have had three main problems with the device.  These issues get temporarily resolved -- usually by the onerous chore of factory resets (I've done 3 of them) -- then they come back.  These issues pretty much render the tablet useless to me for the things I need a tablet to do.\n\n1) Exchange does not run properly.  On numerous occasions, it simply stops receiving (or enabling me to send) emails on my company's email system.  Sometimes I can get this to fix itself by re-booting or by turning wireless off and on, or by removing Exchange and adding it back.  But, this problems happens with too much regularity for the device to be useful and, as of right now, Exchange is not running at all.\n\n2) The internet is often slow as molasses -- like the speed of the old dial-ups, even though we have FiOS.  My wife's iPad works just fine, as does my iPhone (even when I have the cellular turned off to do a comparison on WiFi only).\n\n3) Probably because of 2), streaming movies, TV or other video is often a problem -- choppy playback that often simply stops for several seconds before resuming.  This even happens on YouTube, a Google service.\n\nI have other, specific gripes about the device / operating system -- e.g., it won't run Amazon Instant Video, it can't create playlists with more than 1,000 items, Google Pics takes it upon itself to reorganize my photo albums, etc. -- but the three items above are by far my principal complaints.\n\nThere are some things I do like about the device compared to the iPad -- Swype keyboard, very nice display, greater ability to customize, a version of Open Office (though I understand the new iPads have a productivity suite as well).  But these benefits, and the lower price, do not come close to balancing out the time and aggravation caused by these issues that make the device pretty much useless to me."}

The weight, PC compatability, and storage capability were nice selling points.\n\nThe thing I disliked about it was the lack of instructions available.  A small booklet was included but not very helpful.  Fumbling around with it, I was able to figure out a few things but I think it would be frustrating for the average user.  With a background in computers (degree in programming as well as providing extensive tech support in multiple platforms), I was able to manage the initial setup, though it was not very intuitive.  I set it up, added the wireless router access, added a few apps, and charged it before giving it to my wife for her birthday.  Had I not done that initially, I think she would have said to return it.

It runs all desired applications without issue, but when the battery drops below 50%, the wireless begins cutting out with frustrating regularity, around three or four times a minute for around two to five seconds each time. I purchased this tablet for use as a productivity and entertainment tool, and while it mostly succeeds at the former, it fails pretty miserably at the latter. I would be able to let this issue go if it didn't occur while the tablet is plugged in, but since the stock charger doesn't charge the device fast enough to keep up with the power output while watching streaming video, it persists until I stop using it and let it charge to 100%. I have attempted to reset the device to factory defaults several times, and I have spoken with Samsung support on three separate occasions. It was sent in for maintenance one time and the only actions performed according to the ticket were to reload the software, which essentially boils down to performing a factory reset again. Two more calls after that and they offered to let me send it back in for more maintenance since the manufacturer's warranty does not cover replacement. I should also mention at this point that my wireless network can be ruled out as I have a large number of other wireless devices of different types, including three other tablets from different manufacturers, that do not have any issues. After looking online for a while I noticed that while this problem doesn't occur on all Nexus 10 tablets, it occurs on enough of them that I would say your best bet would be to find a different Android tablet like the Nexus 7, or go with an iPad if you're on the fence about Android vs. iPad. I personally prefer Android tablets over iPads due to the more open developer platform, but for people just looking for a device for entertainment and productivity, either is really fine. It is important to mention that there are reports that Google is dropping Samsung as the manufacturer of the Nexus 10 and switching over to Asus, the company that produces the Nexus 7. I have heard very few complaints about the Nexus 7, so if you want the 10 inch Google sponsored tablet, wait until around Christmas of 2013 and buy the one manufactured by Asus."}

There didn't seem to be any resolution so it was time to make a change.  I use the tablet mostly for reading, email, and surfing the web.  I'm also in school and most of the course content requires flash player (wasn't happening with the iPad).  I downloaded Firefox and an archived version of flash player.  Aside from the fact the Firefox beta is still a bit unstable, I'm satisfied with it's performance.  Of course I realize that has nothing to do with the tablet itself.  Also, this tablet is far less expensive than a new iPad...it's just as good if not better.  Since I have an Android phone, I especially like the fact my Google profile syncs with the Nexus.  I'm very happy with this so far."}

The screen is, of course, awesome, no complaints.  I have read complaints about the battery life, I usually surf the internet, or watch youtube videos, or read comic books, as such, I have to charge this tablet about every 2 days, that is not too bad.  I haven't really experienced too many issues, it froze up once when I was playing a game, but eventually I was able to fix the issue.  I did get an app to disable all of the unnecessary apps from running to speed up the tablet and to conserve battery power, and the auto brightness feature, while it is nice to have, is annoying to me, so I disabled it.  There are numerous tips that can be found through a google search to maximize the power of the tablet, I recommend reading those.  Also, I would buy an OTG and a POGO cable right when you buy this tablet, trust me, they help.  With the OTG cable, you can use usb memory sticks or sd cards, mass media drives, and can also connect joysticks, keyboards, and mice to the tablet, well worth the money. The POGO cable allows you to charge your tablet faster, a nice feature to have!  All in all, an excellent tablet with very few flaws, I highly recommend it!"}

The Google Nexus has no Flash Player!\n\nI would have given a 2 star rating had it not been for finding a manual work around for this deficiency. It takes mid level technical skills to get a flash player to work on the Google Nexus. It will not be supported by the Android/Google App Store. The Browser Google Chrome will not play the Flash Player even with the work around.\n\nI wanted the Tablet for 3 main reasons all of which involve entertainment. Reading, Music, and Video. If any of these mediums require a flash player, you are out of luck using this Tablet as it is intended for. I found very quickly that Amazon On Demand Videos will not work with this Tablet. They use a Flash Player and there was no alternate that I could find. Any of the online Radio Stations that use Flash to deliver their music will not work. The weather websites I create will not play the animations using the Flash content.\n\nWhy would a multi-billion dollar corporation release a product that leaves out Flash content? It was designed for the Internet wasn't it? You can't even use \"Google's Flash Player\" they use to deliver their Youtube Videos. They give you a scaled player to view the videos. It has none of the features (CC, Video quality selection, URL Copy, etc..) you get with the full blown Flash Player they don't support on the Nexus Tablet.\n\nIf you don't mind giving up Flash content on the World Wide WEB, then buy this thing. Otherwise find a complete Tablet that allows all features on the Web to work,"}

I've had Samsung Galaxy Tab's, ASUS Transformer Tablets to name a few and this Nexus 10 is by far the best I've had yet.  I was a bit concerned by the dual core specs listed but I haven't seen the tablet lag even a bit on the latest release of Android 4.3.  The screen resolution puts my newer iPad 3 & 4's to shame, plus I generally prefer holding the 16x9 oriented Android tablets over the more 4x3 oriented Apple iPads.  The tablet is well built with very rigid matte black plastic.  It doesn't flex like some other plastic tablets I've had previously.  I enjoy the indicator light on the front of the tablet, that's a feature that doesn't seem to exist on the competitors' tablets.  In addition to the fluidity of the software and the quality of the hardware it is nice to know you'll get Android OS updates from Google for a few years.  You don't have to play the manufacturer waiting and guessing game of will you ever get an Android upgrade.  Overall this is a quality Samsung product made better by being part of the Nexus program."}

Since buying this I've once again started to feel the will to live, experienced several out of body experiences that have made me wiser and spiritually stronger, made me much more attractive to the opposite sex and brought my ancestors back from the dead.\nAll of that said the only downside was that I bought it for my wife as an anniversary gift. She loves it; bear in mind she has a cell phone that we tried to give to a mugger and we hide when walking into a tech store as everyone starts to snicker and then laugh uncontrollably.\nIn all seriousness, it really does work well, very respononsive to touch, a beautiful screen that makes anything you're looking at much more attractive (I find this particularly handy when forced to look at pictures of myself), and front-facing speakers. For the price I don't think you can really beat the size if you're looking to use this device for things like, movies, skype, youtube and pretty much anything that you'll want to see the screen for.\nIf you're more into apps, games that take less than five minutes and a work-horse that's around the same price I'd probably recommend the iPad 4th gen or the Nexus 7 for their utility coupled with ease of passage."}

I thought I would be getting a outstanding tablet with speed, crisp screen, and good touch interface. I must say I am disappointed with the performance of Nexus 10 and all. I also own a iPad4 because my son took control of it so much, I decided to go ahead and get something different for myself which for Android the best one out there is Nexus 10 according to the so called expert reviewers out there. Problem #1) The touch is just not as responsive as the iPad4, I need it to touch 2 to 3 times on something to get there. Whereas, the iPad4 is almost always instant to the touch of the finger. Problem #2) Using the stock Google Chrome browser, when I scroll down the page, the words and pictures became blur, took about one to two seconds for the words and pictures to clear up. This is just not acceptable for a tablet at this price range. Problem #3) They system upgrade to Android Jelly Bean 4.3 means you would have your wi-fi dropping off constantly which is insanely frustrating. All these are true to my experience, I am not just writing something to knock this product. I also own the Nexus 7 which in my opinion is a better product than the Nexus 10. Since I own both the Nexus 10 and iPad4, I can honestly say the iPad4 is a superior product, it just less headache and I feel the screen resolution is notch better than the Nexus 10 too even though the spec say otherwise. All and all, I would not recommend Nexus 10."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I purchased this tablet as a replacement for my iPad as the processing was very slow and I had repeated issues with it not being compatible with the websites I had to use for school.  This being the only computer I really own I needed this tablet to do pretty much everything I need as a primary computer.  It is also of note that although it is no where near a necessity but very very handy, I do have a Galaxy S3 phone which is compatible with the Android system on this tablet.\n\nThe speed on this tablet is remarkable!  The processing speed is the primary reason I chose this tablet and I am NOT disappointed.  Other great aspects are that Google is responsible and timely with their updates as opposed to the Galaxy Tab or the iPad.  The graphics are also extraordinary!  Again, not at all disappointed!\n\nThe basic layout of how to navigate the tablet took a little while as I was switching from the ipad, however, after a few days I  have grown to love the three button layout; the back button, the home button, and what I will term the open programs button.  This last button shows all the programs that are running/frequently used so you can easily and very quickly switch among programs.  I absolutely LOVE this button after getting used to the OS.  The iPad was nice if you only had to switch amongst one or two however it was a little bit of a pain to switch if you had seven programs open in my opinion.  Another feature I love is being able to create up to eight home screen \"folders.\"  These can be renamed and you effectively just put whatever apps or programs you like into as many as eight different folders that show the all of the programs at a simple touch.  So I have school in one with my word processing program, kindle viewer, my downloads button, and one other program in there.  Another I have media with my camera, gallery, etc.  Another I have music with my downloads, my media player, my downloader, pandora etc.  All of these are viewable just by touching the specific folder button.  REALLY REALLY convenient feature!\n\nHope this helps!\n\nI also google searched for best tablet case/cover reviews and dollar for dollar the case I bought CANNOT be beat in my opinion!  It is a Khomo black leather case with bluetooth keyboard for 35 bucks!  Here is the link and I hope all of this helps!\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=khomo+nexus+10&tag=googhydr-20&index=aps&hvadid=6319057101&hvpos=1t1&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=18062338501224429972&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&hvdev=t&ref=pd_sl_7xcvnr38oa_b"}

If you have it plugged in and are using it at the same time, it doesnt even charge, instead it just sort of idles. And also within a week of owning this device I would be browsing the web and the screen would freeze and then the device would reset itself. One time I was checking my fantasy football scores and it didn't even freeze. Instead it just wouldn't even let me turn the screen on or turn the device on or off. So I looked it up online and I had to do a system reset.......that should not happen when you purchase a $400+ device within the first week. Just spend the extra money and get an Ipad because those seem to be better quality or a kindle fire because they are so much cheaper. Needless to say I am returning this device."}

I have also read that it will not charge while playing a game, as it goes down faster than charging, but that is no reason not to plug it in while using it. I run it heavy for 1 to 2 days before charging over night. Android 4.3 is really nice, because you can have multiple user profiles. This is important for the kids so that they have independent saved game positions (they fight a lot about this on the DSiXL, Wii, and Nook). The rubber back makes it easy to hang on to. It is great for netflix, and even dlna streaming. I use it for too many things to list here. However, it is WiFi only, and does not have an SD slot. For this, I recommend getting the 32GB version, and signing up for things like DropBox or Google Drive (both free). For mobile internet connectivity, I just tether to my Samsung Galaxy Note 2, and use the 4G, which works really well. The Google Nexus is actually made by Samsung, so it is a good product. It does also have Bluetooth, NFC, HDMI out, and a standard micro USB charging port. There is another charging port on the bottom for a \"quick charger\".

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "Coming from the Asus TF300T to the Nexus 10 is like going from being homeless to living in a lush and lavish mansion. I used a tablet primarily for my college classes (Ebooks, PowerPoint slides, PDF notes, homework, etc), but now I use it more than my laptop.  For school alone, the TF300T was good enough...but now I needed something more powerful and faster. So I decided to get the N10. One week in and here are my results:\n\nGOOD: The high resolution display of the Nexus 10 is beautiful to behold as well as its smoothness of the OS. High graphic games as well as memory intensive apps run with such fluidity and ease. The speed of the N10 is nothing short of amazing...from web surfing to reading articles to playing games, the speed at which every task is done is superb. The sound quality is to be expected with a tablet...not mind-blowing but good enough for the tasks needed.  The dual speakers is an added bonus as a way to bring in some sort of stereo sound.\n\nBAD: 2 issues I found...the WiFi connection seems to flicker when an app, such as a MMORPG, constantly uses the connection. It drops the connections in some instances.  There is an app that fixes this issue (WiFi Fixer is its name), but I rather see this problem taken care of through Google instead of having to get an app to do so. The auto-brightness sensor is hit-or-miss when it comes to screen brightness...sometimes it works extremely well and other times the brightness fluctuates randomly when I transition from light to dark (or vice versa). A simple fix for that is to simply turn off auto-brightness in settings.\n\nOverall I am really impressed with this tablet. If you can get through those 2 issues, the N10 is a great tablet.\n\nBy the way, I don't discriminate between brands...I choose what I consider is best for my tastes. By no means am I a fanboy of any product or OS.  I have a WP8 phone (Nokia Lumia 920),  An HP G71-340US Windows 7 laptop, an Apple iPod classic (120GB), and a Google N10 32GB."}

Navigation is quite zippy with no lag. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and I feel the Nexus 10 is superior. I've also played around with an Ipad briefly and I would choose the Nexus 10 over it. This is the perfect media consumption device. There is one flaw, there is light bleed from the screen. I was surprised by this. My other tablets have light bleed as well. The light bleed is only noticeable on a very dark to black screen. But everything else about the tablet is so good, I'm able to overlook this. The rubbery backing is excellent and make this device a pleasure to hold and use. The sound is also very good, though not as good as the Galaxy Note 10.1. I feel the color temperature is spot on with the Nexus. The Galaxy Note 10.1 is too cool, making whites appear blue. The Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is too warm and the colors are too saturated. With the Nexus 10, videos are phenomenal. The colors are natural and the image is super sharp. Easily the best screen I've seen on any tablet, or computer for that matter. This is truly an amazing tablet, the best I've used so far."}

I have been playing around with a Nexus 10 for months now and decided to take the plunge. Why? Well, for one, you get all the updates from Google first.  I have an Asus Transformer Prime (TF201) and at the time, it was the first quad core Tegra 3 tablet on the market.  It boasted a 1280 x 800 resolution screen with less than 200 ppi. Now, I do a lot of reading on my Prime and then I noticed how the reading using the Kindle App on the Nexus 10 was. Wow. Very crisp, very easy on the eyes, on such a beautiful screen.  Going back to my Transformer Prime each time I tinkered with a Nexus 10 was like going from high definition back to a standard definition TV.  The screen is THAT gorgeous looking.  After playing around with the Nexus 10 on and off for many months each time I made a visit into my local Staples store, I noticed how seeing such a beautiful screen made a difference.  Also, unlike my Prime, there was almost no lag. Wow. A 10.1 inch screen with little or no lag.  I played around with an Asus Transformer Pad Infinity which had a decent screen, but it lacked the horsepower to run that screen, which led to a lot of lag.  Now, I can only imagine what the Nexus 10 2 will be like in regards to screen quality and usability, but as of now, this is the best Android tablet out there, bar none.  Yeah, the battery charging feature is one of the few drawbacks of this thing, but aside from that, the pros outweigh the cons.  It was nice to have a tablet with a dockable keyboard to make it somewhat like a mini netbook (in regards to Asus's Transformer line of tablets), but the cons outweighed the pros when I was playing around with the Transformer series.  I'm happy that Google still pushes updates on its line of products (they released Jellybean 4.3 OTA for my first gen Nexus 7). I can only hope that the updates keep rolling in as long as the Nexus 10 can handle it for the next year or so.  I hate rooting my devices mainly for warranty purposes. But most of all, I hate waiting for the next update to come around months after it was already officially released by Google. I've rooted my Android tablets in the past and got really tired of mixing and matching several different ROMs.  I'd rather get the updates from the tap (Google)."}

All of them suffer the same issues that ultimately were a deal-breaker:\n\n1) Wi-Fi signal is weaker than any other device I compared to (used a myTouch4G phone and Samsung Galaxy Note for comparison + Network signal info and SpeedTest apps). Consistent weaker signal using both bands. Video streaming suffers as a result, sometimes to a point where it is unbearable.\n\n2) Overall battery life suffers from driving such a high-resolution screen, certainly an overkill for a tablet.\n\n3) Battery charging is the worst nightmare as mentioned by so many other reviewers. You need ~10 hours to fully charge it using the standard charger. I haven't tried POGO charger, but from what I read the difference in charging rates is not that dramatic.\n\n4) That's not all. If there is any activity on the tablet, the USB charger can't really keep up, so the best you can hope for is that you battery will stop discharging, but working and charging at the same time is not going to happen. If there is a lot of CPU load, the battery keeps discharging even with the charger plugged in, just at a slower rate.\n\nEnded up returning all units and getting a TF700 instead, so far everything works fine. The design is not on par with Google Nexus, but the performance is great.\n\nAlas, Google Nexus = back to the drawing board."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "The Nexus 10 is a solid 10\" tablet with a display that beats out 99% of competitors' offerings nowadays. The display alone is 100% of why I purchased the tablet (I wanted it for reading technical documentation) and it hits that right on the money. Colors are sharp and vivid, text is smooth and clear as day, and blacks are black.\n\nGreat for rooting. The first thing I did when this arrived was root the tablet, install ClockworkMod Recovery and the CyanogenMod 10.1 ROM. It is smooth and fast with CM and customizable to all my needs.\n\nOn the downside, this is a 16x10 screen. This aspect ratio is great for movies, but I don't plan on using my tablet for that. 16x10 is awful for nearly everything else. It does not properly fit most PDF books or academic research papers. It does not feel good in your hand, and is moderately uncomfortable regardless of whether it is held horizontally or vertically. It feels like I am holding a miniature widescreen television, not a pad of paper or a paperback book.\n\nPressure sensitivity on the display is bad. Do not expect to be able to paint with this tablet like the recently announced Toshiba Excite Write. General sensitivity is OK. Multitouch is OK. There are bug reports floating around that 10 fingers on the tablet will result in at least one of the touches not registering. This does not necessarily affect me, but it does affect some people.\n\nResponse time and refresh is not awesome, which is expected from a tablet. The Nexus 10 is no worse than others. I am not sure what kind of gaming this would be relevant for nowadays, but do not expect to be able to hook up a mouse and keyboard and play Quake on this thing. It will look blurry every time you turn. For 99% of people who might want to play games on their tablet, this criticism will not matter.\n\nThere is no SD card slot. This fallback is as close to a dealbracker as there could be for this tablet. Regardless of Google's desire for everyone to put their data on the cloud, this means the Nexus 10 can never function as a standalone media tablet, even with 32 GiB of space. It needs WiFi connection for true multimedia usage, and not having wireless and expecting to use this tablet for multimedia makes the Nexus 10 the equivalent of a $500 brick. In my case, I preloaded it with PDFs and epubs, so in areas without WiFi I can still read books.\n\nThings like CPU speed are difficult to review. The specs on this thing were top of the line when the tablet was released, but by now they are already dated. While the Nexus 10 is still noticeably speedy, it is without doubt that by the end of August this tablet will no longer be worth its price tag."}

My kid has her account loaded with tons of games and learning apps that I would hate to have to see if we had to share the same user account. Plus I have content that I don't want others to see.\nScreen resolution is great. Great for photos and video as well as online browsing. And I border-line need reading glasses so it will work even better for most.\n\nCon: Ever since android 4.2.2 update my system memory will gradually fill up until the device becomes sluggish and only a reboot will clear it. This has been determined to be due to a GPU device driver memory leak for at least four months but Google has not released any patch to fix it.

Whether true or not, it appeared to me that the Kindle Fire only allowed you to download from the Amazon store. I received the Nexus 10 as a gift a few weeks ago. It had been purchased at Google Play, rather than Amazon, where I ordinarily shop. I wanted a 10\" tablet because it's a good form factor for reading magazines and watching movies. Magazines are going digital and a tablet is going to become a necessity for reading magazines sooner rather than later. I particularly wanted a tablet for the New Yorker. When I first received it, a New Yorker app wasn't available, but happily that changed within a week of my tablet's arrival. The New Yorker app is great, though it doesn't yet allow me to access the New Yorker archives. The screen is clear and sharp. The Wi-Fi is fast, at least compared to my HTC EVO phone. Netflix works great with it. It seems well put together. I like the surface of the back which provides some adhesion, so I never feel that it will slip out of my hands. As a calendar and email reader it's as good as a computer. The battery often last three days. Some people say that a 10 inch tablet is too large and heavy for holding while you read. I haven't found this to be the case, though it is a little unwieldy for carrying around. I bought the Google cover for it to protect the screen. It was easy to install and what I like best is when I open the cover the tablet wakes up and when I close the cover it goes to sleep. Although this tablet was a gift, I would buy a Nexus 10 in a second."}

I love its sleek design, easy operation and speed with which it connects to every app site.  I think it would have been useful to have the operation manual written without assuming the user has prior knowledge of how to use a computer. By that I mean that some of the problems I encountered where not answered by referring to the manual, but by going on the web and seeing how others resolved similar problems with navigation or closing open apps. As I have become more adept at using it I really enjoy its versatility and connectedness to my home computer. I am excited to learn something new that it can do each day I turn it on."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I've owned 3 tablets: an Asus TF300T, a TF700T, and a Nexus 10. All are very good, but the Nexus 10 is my favorite.\n\nI bought a TF700T to replace a broken TF300T. On my TF700T the case frame fit the digitizer glass poorly, which caused the glass to flex near the power connector. The performance not snappy. For $550, I expected more in performance and quality. I returned the TF700T. (Kudos to Amazon for an awesome return policy.)\n\nI then bought a Nexus 10, which is terrific. I particularly like the front-mounted stereo speakers, which make the TF700T's single-port, rear-facing speaker seem like from Dad's pocket AM radio. Performance is snappy.\n\nParticular likes about the Nexus 10:\n- USB charger (proprietary cable not needed). Charges off a 700mA charger!\n- power and volume location is more sensible than on the TF700T.\n- early Android releases\n- best responsiveness of all three\n\nDislikes:\n- No SD card. This is the differentiating factor that concerns me most.\n- When using face unlock, the camera takes a few seconds to turn on. (TF700T was instantaneous.)\n- The camera is pointed off-center. I think this is intentional for some uses, but it's always pointing at my left ear when hand held.\n- Slower charging. (I've read that charging via the alternate pogo connector is faster.)\n\nI have been very impressed with the ease of migrating between Android devices (2 phones and 3 tablets to date)."}

I kept picking up my wifes iPad (gift from my Dad) and trying to see what made an iPad \"better\".  Nothing except speed and battery as far as I could tell.  iTunes is a kludge (my wife has problems remembering her password so just buying or downloading an app turns into a major effort).\n\nSo, I soldiered on with my Xoom - until I saw a Nexus 10.  Wow.  Fast, light, great display, snappy browser...  And I bought it.\n\nGoogle seamlessly put my apps on it as soon as I registered it.\n\nOnly issue is the slow charging time with the USB cable and the 'neutral' charging (as in it doesn't) when you use it when it's plugged in.  The solution is the pogo cable sold right here on Amazon so there is no issue (yes, Google should have included a magnetic pogo cable as the charging cable)."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "This is my first tablet.  And as such, I chose to purchase one of the fastest available.  True, for $50 more I could have purchased an iPad, but I chose to stick with Android since everything else I have is Android.\n\nAs for the tablet, no issues.  Occasionally it will lock up forcing a reboot.  No complaints with that.  It doesn't happen more than once per week on heavy use weeks.  Its not like I shut it down after every use.  If I did, I would expect it to run perfectly all the time.\n\nI easily loaded thousands of guitar pro files for the android guitar pro app.  Now I can take ALL my music with me where ever I go.  For me, this more than justified the purchase.  If I want more memory, I will purchase a micro USB adapter.  I don't store movies or music on it.  I have other hardware for that.  Other than gp files, I mostly use it for JW publications as a study tool.  Nice to be able to keep electronic files of the books and magazines at hand.  Speeds up my study time as well.\n\nNo issues with charge times.  I typically charge at night when at 20%.  Also bought the pogo charger but don't use it much.  Its great being able to use the same charger for all my devices (work BB, HTC One, Jawbone..)\n\nNo cons yet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "STOP EVERYTHING! before you buy this tablet, look into a pogo charger... Seriously this device has a terrible charge rate and a proprietary cable should have been considered... 8 to ten hours to charge this, and it will use the percentage almost like a laptop would. This is the only tablet I know that will eat the battery right out of the box. Do not bank on using it on charge and never having to worry about drainage. But the experience is so smooth. You'll feel like you're playing a ps2 game, back when the hardware pushed the software and not the other way around.\n\nAlso, the speakers leave much to be desired vs the kindle. Your hands also cup around the kindle speakers so you'll be sure to hear it better depending on how you handle the device.\n\nIt's safe to say the nexus is a powerhouse, I fully loaded my tablet like I have done to my last and it still plows through games and apparently with no flinching aside from some hard loading on ironman the official game. But! The tablet doesn't warn you when it doesn't like the environment. So sometimes you'll face a force close out of nowhere and feel like the device may not be compatible... Just kill some tasks with the multitask button and it will return to it's old self, running through content. But it seems clear that this really isn't a normal tablet. and it might have been made to at least stare windows 8 convertibles in the face. Because the processing power at the sake of life is apparent. It feels impractical and I'm sure everyone feels it when they have to stop the experience to charge it. Or have the tablet close a game and you would angrily wonder why until you see you only have 2 percent. Right out of the box it died at 10%, but after that it hasn't happened\n\nNetflix is great, and the YouTube application gives the same impression.\n\nIt's the price of power I guess, the tablet will fly through it's own clothes (battery) if you don't stop it. The stability may get better after it actually charges, but if you knew how powerful this thing is you'd struggle to stop.\n\nI'll probably update again later, but until then my old review is below.\n\nUnlike kindle, the support base is a lot bigger, you can finally take on apps like grand theft auto 3 and vice city, and nvidia actually has a few games that work well here.\n\nWell after my tragic defeat in trying to make kindle into a Google tablet... I bought this guy! I've only had it for a few hours but I can tell you now that it's surely a clean experience. The apps load very well, the only application that gives me trouble is go keyboard, and it's only in the settings.\n\nI'm comparing these two devices because they're rivals in my opinion.\nKindle fire hd 8.9 and the nexus are both full hd tablets, are supposedly the only tablets that have mimo Wi-Fi, lack tegra 3 for no good reason at all, have no sd card slot, and are amazing in their own right... but personally, you're getting what you pay for with these two... they're both incredible, but the nexus 10 literally shadows and engulfs it if compared by specs alone, while at a first real gaming use the kindle will prove to be more geared to someone who is using the tablet vs looking at it multitask seamlessly.\n\nOne HUGE disadvantage to this tablet is the engine, it is not tegra. At this point it should be depressing that a device has to support tegra to have a stable feed of high end apparently that make your tablet stand out. Another is that I don't see any software correlation to Samsung apps, such as killer candies like the artistic element. It seems apparent that we're going to have to wait a little longer for this tablet to shine, which better happen some time in it's life. Especially at the price point.\n\nHardware build is second to the kindle hd in my opinion. If you're charging and broadcasting video you'll be met with cables sprouting at opposite ends of the device, if you trigger a loud ad you're probably going to have to find a spot to prop the tablet so you can adjust. Volume isn't a shortcut on the first or second notification. And Amazon wows with their out of the way navigation and favorites button.\n\nSoftware wise this tablet wins hands down, with tons of multitasking and smooth function, you'll only wish Amazon had a hand on the build and that Samsung used more common hardware. You'll be very pleased with how this tablet handles itself, but one test I haven't tried is streaming an hd flash video in full screen... that would normally make the kindle seize up and force close the dolphin browser... no wonder they had no browser alternatives.\n\nI haven't tried the camera, because I believe the Amazon camera was pretty dull. And I really don't have anything I would like to capture at this specific moment. Microphones were most likely properly placed moreso on the kindle.\n\nGoogle and Amazon have apparently done brilliant jobs at ensuring that you don't have an excess of bloatware, they offer the minimum to get your mainstream media ready to run and enjoy. Google sort of throws new material at you like hangouts and now, while Amazon sticks to the forte and offers Skype.\n\nThe internet speed is similar, and I find that both could probably be pushing similar speeds but the amounts of downloads stopped through crashes and failure to multitask will most certainly make the nexus look like the clear Victor, especially if kindle stops Wi-Fi when it's asleep too long.\n\nI will not comment on the Google store being an advantage because there's a way around it, but Amazon apps that I bought for my kindle hasn't transferred properly, so I'm guessing they're lost... which is sort of a slap in the face to anyone who won't stick to a kindle line... (don't quote me, but none of my saled gameloft dollar games want to work.) A big disadvantage for Google is being notified that Google will monitor installed applications... so emulator guys and people who want to test compatibility may be hit for piracy if the paid apparently has a rubbish licence check that let's you through. I've also gotten some trouble with re licensing on it, and I am left unable to validate my in app purchases.\n\nThe nexus 10 has on the go cable support, BUT the most practical device someone would want to otg would be a phone in my opinion... and it doesn't read mine very well unfortunately. If you want surefire otg use, I suggest you buy a card reader to USB, but I do not have one or have tried one. So look around to confirm my suspicion. It does in fact work very well with the ps3 controller.\n\nI haven't tested either of this devices in HDMI usage. But I do own a cable for the fire hd and hope to God it works for the nexus 10. ON A SIDE NOTE. every game with control maps with strict pixel scales will make games troublesome on this tablet, no exceptions. Playing sealing sword and shadow on this is terrible, because the analog is the size of the capital letter O on the keyboard. Other games such as mame will have smaller buttons for the same reason, but it won't ruin gameplay.\n\nThis device will get hot! Playing games like iron man will pressure the system, and it does skip sometimes, but if a slight skip is all a polished game like that will give considering it's.almost the temperature as a hotcake, as heat throttling, I'm sure this tablet will be ready for a lot of things Google will come up with.\n\nOverall, if you want an hd device that is dedicated to content and offers an experience that will make you happy then sad within the same update... (International kindle sale, deliberate disabling of wallpaper) at a price that will make you shrug your shoulders and hit buy, you can definitely get and fully enjoy a kindle fire hd 8.9. But if you want a device with obvious potential backed by Google's brand, that seems more than capable of handling itself under pressure, and is one of only three tablets I know that decided to make a full hd experience in your hands. I'd pick this one for the long haul and options. Though at the price point, I would also consider the iPad if I wasn't so invested in Google apps.\n\nEither way, if you really wanted a tablet, both of these are great choices... firmware and the client destroys the kindle and Google is what it always was. I'm sure Google isn't going to heave an update that makes you want to stop using the tablet like the kindle did to users who hate the home screen. But if you can ignore it the price is a dream. For everyone else, you should give this a try or a few reviews."}

They all had shortcomings...until now.  I ordered the Nexus 10 after convincing myself that it looked and sounded like what it was I really found important and wanted in a tablet.  Boy!  I was not wrong.  I have been using the Nexus 10 for a couple of weeks now and can report that this tablet is fantastic in every way.  The screen is quite remarkable.  It is fast!\n\nAlso, it has the best keyboard and touch that I have found on any of those other tablets.  The Pad-thing could learn something here...and I am sure they will probably update its keyboard since that is one of the big trouble spots I found with my iPad 2,3, and 4.  The newest android system is quite easy to get around...and, did I say this was fast?????  I mean smoking fast.  Others have said the iPad has nothing to worry about from the Nexus....really?  Give it time.\n\nI use my Nexus for productive (school) uses, surfing the Internet, email and social media.  I love, love, love this tablet.  I bought the 32 due to restrictive expansion (sounds familiar doesn't it?).  If you're in the market...please consider checking out the Nexus.  I bought a \"refurb\" unit that was fulfilled by Amazon for a really decent price and it looks brand spanking new (probably really is).  Also purchased a magnetic cover and screen protector that was easy to install...just followed directions.  Total package = excellent.\n\nUPDATE:  6/8/13\n\nI was wrong.  My initial feelings and vibes reported above were a bit premature.  My patience was put to the test this week, and, as of today, the Nexus 10 is going back.  This entire week, the Nexus 10 started acting \"funny\".  It was surprisingly sluggish - much more than when I first got it, and I didn't add but a couple of apps that were pretty lame and should not have impacted performance.  Then I started getting the lock-ups which needed the hard reboots that a lot of folks talk about.  Finally, today, even when using Chrome (Google's own search engine!), things just would not load...at all.  I tried using Dolphin and still nothing.  Enough is enough.  Between the slow responses, hard reboots required daily, and now search engine issues when I try to surf anywhere - I am calling it quits on the Nexus...white flag is going up the pole.  I am very disappointed as I really did think this was \"the one\"!  I still think that once the bugs get worked out, I will be all in since I just loved this machine.  The feel, the looks, the keyboard, the interface....the entire package was great, but the frustrating features were too much and I can't tolerate such things.  Google just needs to get it right and this tablet will kick some serious butt all over the place."}

This time the package from Amazon arruved on time without any obvious damage.  When I opened the package I first noticed that the product seals were broken.  I opened the box and the clear plastuc over the device looked as if it had been previously removed.  This was to be a new unopened device!  I felt uneasy so I applied for a refund.  Amazon responded very well by sending  me a UPS label to return the device. Great job byAmazon, however new unopened should mean exactly that."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "Being both a Mac and PC user and wanting something more portable for travel and casual use, I bought the Ipad 4 and the Nexus 10 at the same time to compare.  I'll be returning Nexus 10.  Because the Ipad has been around much longer than the Nexus, the Nexus is at a huge disadvantage as far as having good apps.  I found many of the apps for the Nexus 10 were simple Android phone versions, not utilizing the additional screen size this size tablet afforded.  Whereas the Ipad 4 apps were all specifically written for the additional screen size of the Ipad vs. the Iphone.  I found many more things frustrating on the Nexus, for example simple zooming in the Mail application, wouldn't do it.  The much hyped screen resolution of the Nexus 10 was hardly discernible over the Ipad 4.  Even though the screen width is slightly larger on the Nexus, the overall screen size in square inches of the Nexus 10 is LESS than the Ipad, it is simply too narrow, unless all you want to do is downstream widescreen movies, i found it's proportions not good for running most apps.  There is no Itunes app for the Android, therefore you can't use Airplay, a very popular way of streaming your media to you TV or stereo.  If you want to download your Itunes library from your PC or Mac, good luck, I couldn't figure it out, there is no easy way, and a google search will confirm this.  I found the touchscreen to be very inconsistent on the Nexus 10, sometimes it was fine, other times, depending on the application, and size of the icon, very hard to press and activate, there was an inconsistency I haven't experienced on the Ipad 4. The camera and movie functions were simpler and of better quality on the Ipad 4. One thing I did like on the Nexus 10  is a backward arrow always visible on the bottom of the screen to retrace your steps which was often used and very handy.  Perhaps in 2 or 3 years if Google stays committed to the tablet they will catch up to Apple, but right now, it's not even close.  Perhaps there are workarounds to some of my observations cited above, but to me not worth the time or trouble, especially when the Ipad 4 ran so well out of the box for just slightly more money."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I have owned the original iPad, iPad mini, Motorola Xoom, Transformer Prime, Transformer Infinity and now the Nexu 10 and the Nexus 10 is by far my favorite.\n\nI wanted more flexibility then the iPads could offer so I switched to android tablets.\n\nI started with the Motorola Xoom but that was too underpowered and had difficulty even running a simple live desktop. So since that was a dual core chip I figured I'd look for a quad core tablet. The Transformer Prime was faster with its quad core chip but had I/O issues so it could not multitask. I hoped that they would have resolved it with the newer Transformer Infinity but the same super slow I/O issues were there preventing it from being a multi tasking tablet. So I finally gave the Nexus 10 a try. I was hesitant at first because the Nexus 10 is a Dual core tablet... I wondered how it could possibly stand up to the Quad core tablets but the newer A15 chipset in the Nexus 10 blows the other tablets away.\n\nThe screen is the best I've seen on any computer or tablet and the zippiness of the tablet is incredible. I there is no lag at all between a touch gesture and movement on the screen. There is no stuttering during multitasking. The sound is incredible from the 2 front facing speakers, and i still cant get over the screen.\n\nIts pretty easy to unlock or root with plenty of links out there for one click roots if that your thing.\n\nI would highly recommed this tablet as the only viable iPad alternative for someone looking for more control over thier tablet and at a lower cost."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I am a software engineer of over 25 years and either have or had 4 other tablets besides this one to compare to:  Kindle fire, Nexus 7, ASUS Transformer TF700T, Samsung Aitv w/Windows 8 and by far this one is superior in just about every way for the exception of the Aitv - also made by Samsung.  Were it not for some design shortcomings with Windows 8, The Aitv would rate as high, however this device is far more responsive and performant than anything else on the market.  I purchased it as a direct result of returning the ASUS Transformer due to its lack of performance.  It is the best tablet decision I ever made.  The Transformer comes loaded with lots of great features, but if you cannot consistently perform basic functions such as browsing and loading multiple apps, then it doesn't matter if it has a detachable keyboard with a built in battery and a lot of ports.  Yes the ASUS detachable keyboard included 5 more hours of battery life, but both batteries drained very quickly.  The ASUS almost HAD to have the keyboard attached to make efficient use of the batteries, and it's pass through recharging capability, which at first seemed like a slick feature, but as I used the device more learned that it was not as convenient.  The Nexus 10 drains at a very reasonable rate, effectively providing a longer usage window.  Stand by hardly drains it all, therefore all of the concerns I read from other reviews about the slow charge have not been an issue at all.\nOther reviews included concerns over a dual core vs. quad core technology and perhaps being limited to run less apps.  I have not found this to be the case at all.  In fact, this dual core provides better multitasking and battery efficiency than the ASUS quad core, while having a higher resolution screen.  The engineers should be commended for selecting chip components that are well synchronized to provide an overall good user experience.  Browsing is a joy, searching for things in multiple tabs, having other apps open etc., doesn't phase this thing.  The build quality is excellent - love the \"rubberized\" back, makes it easy to hold in your hands.  The custom Google cover is great for keeping the device easy to transport.  The speakers and the screen are great.  To give you an idea, my digital pictures taken with a 2.0 megapixel camera come alive on this screen.  The device makes me enjoy everything I do with it, makes me want to use it more - that is how you know it provides value."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I thought comparing both units and the Nexus 10 on its own would be a good idea, since many people ask themselves which to buy. Ill rate each area on a 0-5 scale, 5 being the best.\n\nSound:\n\nNote 10.1 - 4.5\nNexus 10 - 4.8\n\nBoth units have great front facing speaking. They do both however lack good low-end. The Nexus edges ahead for being the louder of the 2, and having a clearer upper frequency range.\n\nScreen:\n\nNote 10.1 - 4.6\nNexus 10 - 4.6\n\nThey tie. I know that may seem weird, seeing as the Nexus has that great resolution and DPI, but read on. The resolution of the Nexus is GREAT. I used a few HD Space live wallpaper to compare, and WOW, they look great on the Nexus. My problem with the Nexus is colors are very washed out, on the Note 10.1 colors are very vibrant with deep saturation. When it comes to reading PDFs, Word, and internet browsing, both screens to about the same. Most websites are scaled for average, not high, resolutions. PDF/Docs are both very readable. There is a slight sharpness increase from the Nexus, but you have to really zoom in to see it. Games on both units perform well, but each has its ups and downs. The HD screen provides detail, but the washed our colors really show in HD games and the Note looks better in that regard. Unless you're truly using 1080p+ content, you won't really notice much difference. THe Nexus also has a bit of light bleed, while the Note doesnt.\n\nConstruction:\n\nNote 10.1 - 4.2\nNexus 10 - 4.8\n\nI should preface by saying, I have NO problem with plastic bodies. My problem with the Note is that the plastic feels very thin, and has a LOT of give, and can even \"crink\" when flexing. The Nexus 10 feels VERY solid, and the grippy texture on the back is great. If it wasn't for my Note being in a case, Id worry about it alot, the Nexus, less so. The buttons on the Nexus also seem better build, the are firm and have a good \"click\" when used.\n\nPerformance (real world):\n\nNote 10.1 - 4.4\nNexus 10 - 4.6\n\nThe Nexus edges out ahead just a bit. The UI and app performance is consistently better. Its hard to say if thats because of the hardware or slight better hardware. The only area the Nexus struggled with was using ezPDF. For some reason turning pages made the Nexus skip frame rates, I'm would guess that the app more than the tablet. Games and Apps run great in both, but the Note SOMETIMES hiccups a bit, the Nexus has yet to.\n\nBattery Life:\n\nNote 10.1 - 4.8\nNexus 10 - 4.6\n\nBoth Units have great battery life when it comes to \"real world\" use. My Note lasts my 5ish days, while the Nexus last 3ish. Given the increased screen resolution being rendered and the higher clocked hardware, this is a reasonable tradeoff. Keep in mind these times were achieved with a tuned OS. Rooted with all unneeded services/programs disabled, and I run DS Battery saver on its most aggressive preset.\n\nProductivity:\n\nNote 10.1 - 4.9\nNexus 10 - 4.3\n\nIts REALLY hard to beat the Note in productivity. Multi-window is great, S-pen for handwriting notes and drawing is unmatched.\n\nMisc:\n\nNote 10.1 - 4.4\nNexus 10 - 4.6\n\nThis is mostly how much work it takes to fully setup tablet as a power-user. Both devices root easily. The Note has MANY more services and bloatware to be tuned to really max out the performance of the OS. The Nexus, well thats pretty stock, so only a bit of trimming is required.\n\nStability:\n\nNote 10.1 - 4.8\nNexus 10 -4.8\n\nUpdated to the latest OS on both, they both run great. Ive yet to have an OS lock, random reset, or had to hard reset on either. Both have gotten the occasional random app freeze, but its occasional and most likely the app, not the OS. Its worth noting both tablet to well at recovering from app freezes when they do happen, the OS never needs a hard reset.\n\nStorage:\n\nNote 10.1 - 4.9\nNexus 10 - 4.8\n\nThe Note wins out of box because it got a built in memory card slot. You can root the Nexus and buy an OTG cable and a USB card reader and get the same function. Its just one more step, and added cost though.\n\nSo how do you choose between the 2?\n\nThe Note right now is all about productivity. If you're a student looking to take digital notes, or looking for general productivity the Note wins hands down. I cant tell you the amount of times Ive pulled up a PDF, Word/Powerpoint doc side by side with Papyrus (my preferred note taking app). As a media device the Nexus is better. Music is louder and clearer, and movies in HD look great.\n\nIf anyone would like anything else comparing side-by-side just ask, Id be happy to add it."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "As much as I would like to give the Google Nexus 10 five stars I'm disappointed in the performance and customer service from Google and Samsung. I've had my Google Nexus 10 for 3 months, in the the past two weeks I've had constant freezes and rebooting due to apps and programs. My most recent problem has been using the panoramic mode; when taking photos in panoramic mode by battery life goes from 100% charged to 0%. I contacted Google about the issue and they stated that I would need to contact the manufacturer which is Samsung since I did not purchase my Nexus 10 from the Google Store. So I contacted Samsung about my problem and I was transferred 10 times to several different Samsung departments; in which each representative would tell me that they were transferring me to their Nexus 10 WiFi only department, I never spoke to anyone in the Nexus 10 WiFi only department. Each time I spoke to a representative they wanted me to provide my phone number, full name, area code, and email address which i stopped doing after the 5th transfer, instead I would ask the representative if this was the NEXUS 10 department and the representative would tell that it wasn't and they would transfer me to the \"RIGHT\" department that could help me with with my issue. It was extremely annoying and disappointing that I couldn't get any help after 25 minutes of being on the phone with customer service and after being transferred one last time the automated system ended the call. I called back after the call was ended and once again I was transferred back and forth I then spoke to an Omar who stated that he only worked in the laptop department, a Rachel who then transferred me to a Barry, this Barry was supposedly the person that would be able to help me but he too transferred me to the \"NEXUS 10 WIFI ONLY DEPARTMENT\" after 19 minutes the automated system ended the call. I still don't understand how I kept connecting to people not in the tablet department, since the automated system gives you the choice to connect to the tablet department when you call Samsung customer service. I would say save your money b/c you may need some help from customer services  and unfortunately there won't be any solutions to your problem."}

The Apple people know their products technical capacities, they do not read from scripts, they do not blame your issue on the app you are using and are always helpful. This is not the case for Google support where people don't understand beyond the obvious and are probably locked into the kind of scripts you get from so many help lines these days.

I run chrome, location services on, slingbox, netflix, kindle, some office stuff, radio programs, pandora, the NFL app.  Nothing has any problems.  I like that this is a full android platform with access to all the Play Store stuff my other platform locked me out of.  It runs fast and switches easily between apps.  It doesn't really take longer to charge than my other tablet, although both take a while.  Since I plug it in overnight, so this isn't a problem.  I heartily recommend this tablet.\n\nEdit April 2015: I am more and more dissatisfied with this tablet.  The charger can't keep up with the battery use so I can't use it for long periods.  Even with no use and shut down, a fully charged battery discharges if I leave it off the charger for a day and a night.  It has always deleted the mail on my server even though I have always set that mail option to \"No\".  It automatically shuts down when I leave it long on the charger.  So, it's basically never available for me to just pick up and use.  It always has to restart and then apply all the updates since it last ran.  It's nice once it's up and running but annoying when it's not.\n\nEdit 2 December 2016: I've given up on this and bought something else.  The last time I used it, it was on the charger for a few days, and I used it unplugged for 9 minutes before getting the message that battery was down to 1%.  At least it didn't shut off immediately and plugging it in allowed me to continue browsing a few minutes.  But 9 minutes?? No way.  That makes this tablet completely unusable.  I won't buy another Google device.\n\nEdit July 2016: I'm actively looking for a replacement.  It discharges and shuts down after a couple hours of reading a downloaded ebook."}

Recently, I started looking at the larger tablets because I thought the larger screen size would improve the video watching and ebook reading experiences. After reading many, many reviews of the iPad and 10 inch tablets by Samsung, Asus, Sony, HP and Blackberry, I decided on the Nexus 10. I'm very happy with my choice and have absolutely no regrets. I quickly replaced the ugly, to my taste, wallpaper with one having an abstract design similar to the one Sony uses for its Xperia Z tablet, which was my second choice, and removed the free content provided which was of no interest to me and just cluttered the \"bookshelf\". I bought a Bear Motion (TM) 100% Genuine Cowhide Case Cover with Stand for Google Nexus 10 inch tablet - MP - Brown (Support Auto Wake/Sleep Function), a Nexus 10 Pogo Cable which charges the tablet much faster than the stock charger, and a GrayBean USB OTG cable for Galaxy Nexus which together with the \"Nexus Media Importer\" app and a thumbdrive enables you to increase your memory. (I use it to play videos from a thumbdrive. A word of caution here and I'm not sure if it's necessary, but after destroying a thumbdrive by removing it from a computer USB port without activating the \"Safely Remove Hardware\" feature first, I \"Disconnect\" the thumbdrive in the app before physically separating it from the Nexus and recommend doing that.) These items were also bought through Amazon and are recommended. If you're looking for a 10 inch tablet, I think you would be very happy with this one. I can't find any fault with it. As an aside, I have to say that Google amazes (Have you checked Google Earth lately?), and it will be exciting to see what more they bring to this tablet in the future . . ."}

I use the 3rd generation iPad at work daily; have owned the third generation iPad which I sold; and own an Asus Transformer TF-101 for playing on at home.  Jelly bean was not coming to that particular model so I decided to try the Nexus 10.  After using the Nexus 10 for a month I am very happy I did.  It is very quick even in comparison with the iPad.  The apps I run on it run without hesitation and I have had few hangups though I believe those few to be app problems that will fixed in future updates.  The feel is good; it is thin and light but also feels sturdy.  The resolution is superb though I agree with the color problems I have read about.  For most people using this for light business applications or gaming or just checking email that will not be an issue.  Watching movies I could not really notice a color problem.  If you are using this for photo-proofing or something similar it could be.  The only real issues I have other than the color is the lack of expansion slot for a micro SD card to expand the memory and the wi-fi is not consistent, which I have noticed on other Android tablets.\n  With everything taken into consideration I could recommend this as a top-quality tablet if you are looking for Android O/S."}

It really is the type of device that I had hoped for when buying the offbrand cheapie last year.  Thank you for this price and reliability.  I no often use with itunes or Google Play while attached to bluetooth.  Always, Very sound clear system.  Still 5 stars all around.

I'm now learning the expanse of these voice commands which I'm really liking.  Also doing more voice enabled searches and document-development too.  Very easily finds WiFi regardless of location.  Continues to be fast/responsive to both the internal apps or WiFi activities that I do.

I've now also purchased a portable $30 bluetooth speaker to enhance sound for room.  It had no problem finding speaker to play....

The time it took to get here was far quicker than I had expected.  By the time I had the slip from the attempted delivery and had time to go pic up, I was indeed the one that had lengthened the delivery....  Not this seller....  Thanks to them....\nThe unit is also working fine.  So far, so good....  I had had a very bad experience with a far inferior over priced no-name brand during mid 2012.  So far, I'm ranking this nexus 10 as NOT to be compared to the junk I bought in 2012.  All about it, especially speed, is all quite pleasing. This new voice feature through Google is amazingly accurate.....  Stay tuned as I now plan to write an update review in weeks to come.....  In view and comparison of the android related functionality/apps, etc. Of this unit...

It is not nearly optimized enough for the new a15 chip set. This thing should be able to handle basic computing like browsing the web and navigating the interface no problem but it clearly strugles. The standard chrome browser is a joke and the letterboxing, crashes, and slow page rendering is inexcusable. Many popular apps such as Google Drive... force close on the device. And exiting out of apps usually results in severe home screen redraw. Worst of all, THE TABLET RANDOMLY REBOOTS. Google has finally acknowledged that it is a software issue so all devices are affected until a patch is released.\n\nFor a $200 device, I might be able to be more forgiving. But at $400-$500 this is simply pathetic. Do yourself a favor and look at the iPad or surface rt instead."}

My girlfriend had just gotten an iPad 4 for Nursing School so I had something to compare it with.\n\nLet me say the screen is the pinnacle for tablets by far, just watch the planet earth HD episode that comes with. The pixel density is much better than the iPad but not as saturated, which is fine with me because it looks fake. The speakers set it apart from any tablet in terms of loudness and the fact they are front facing so you don't have to look like an idiot cupping the back of your tablet for people to hear. The camera is surprisingly good; auto focuses and takes photos very fast. Skype looks better on here than my laptop, not to mention its nice to use the back camera for a video tour, concert, etc. Its extremely fast with no hiccups that I've noticed (in 3 months). Frequent updates which is rare for a Android device. Coming from the Tegra 3 quad core processor on the Nexus 7, the dual core A15 1.9Ghz and Mali GPU on the 10 plays games just as well which is impressive for the best screen in tablets. Movies don't get any better. The absolute best video experience in tablets, I guarantee. As an engineering student, this device has been more than capable and helped me be organized and prepared for classes.\n\nReasons why I like my Nexus 10 over my girlfriend's iPad 4:\n-better screen\n-front facing speakers\n-better multi-tasking\n-more customization\n-can open zips\n-can download attachments from sites that the iPad can\n-can use flash\n-can plug in any USB accessories with OTG cable (flash drive, mouse, keyboard, xbox controller) without installing anything or paying for over priced device specific accessories\n\n*iOS does have more tablet optimized apps but that's the OS and not the device itself.

I can listen to this while I take a shower no problem.\nPlays videos including netflix and .mp4 like a dream.\nIf you want amazon prime videos or other flash stuff you will have to download something other than chrome and then do a little tinkering to get flash on here.

Basically  bought it the day before Google annouced the Nexus10. After receiving the Nexus 10, i returned it, since it was still in the returnable period. Sorry Apple..\nGoogle sent me the nexus 10 already pre-set with my Name and preferences. The design is really nice and it feels very easy to keep in my hands.\n\nMany people are worried about the missing SD card slot, but if you really think about it, you can get 50GB of storage on BOX, and Google gives over 200GB of songs stored in Google music, so storage is really limitless. Plus consider the new Wi-drives that stream wirelessly to any tablet or phone and can connect many devices. My Nexus10 It's connected to my LTE cellphone hotspot, so i can access all my documents and music instantly, unless i am in the Subway. That is why i opted t=for the $399.00  16GB. I currently still have about 10Gb of free space and never had a problem waiting to open any CLOUD files.\n\nIn regards to the randoms Shut downs, it's basically Android 4.2.1 that keeps all the programs and files you open still on the RAM even after closing them. I see that when my RAM get full, the tablet then shuts down. A prblem that happens to me every 5 days of heavy usage. I also installed a ram memory booster that informs me the usage of the RAM.\n\nBattery life, i usually use the tablet for at least 2 days in a row, with heavy usage before i put it under charge. So i have really no complains with that. ( i never watch movies or listen to music)\n\nAs a cove i bought a Fintie for $8 and it fits perfectly and since it's bright orange i never forget the tablet around.\n\nI hope this review helps a bit."}

A lot of the high points listed have been problems recently remedied by the new kernel update.\n-The screen is incredibly sharp at such a high DPI.\n-Thin and just light enough to comfortably hold with one hand. The plastic body feels just slightly low-rent, but it's a solid device.\n-2 gigs of ram that is readily used. I see very little (if any) reloading with nearly every app except for Chrome. I can, literally, play two games at once and have Google currents going with no problems.\n-The processor screams and things are very fast now (lag has been readily reduced for me with the new update).\n-Unlocked bootloader makes it very easy to install custom roms. I honestly don't feel much of a need for this now like with most android devices.\n-My battery life is substantially better. Something like 8 or 9 hours of screen time. I find this perfectly acceptable and really think I could eek out more if I wasn't really hounding the thing.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Android has some growing pains. Being first for Google updates is really resolving a lot of the performance inconsistencies on Nexus devices. Phone apps scale fairly well, but in the last month I've noticed that nearly every app I use is tablet optimized. It's not close to the iOS ecosystem yet, but core functionality is there for me.\n-I have never had any luck with auto-brightness on this thing. I'm using an app and the camera sensor to get comfortable automatic brightness switching.\n-Some light leak on the display. It happens with this type of device and is a small amount in the corner that I rarely notice. While everything looks sharp, I'd prefer colors to be a bit more saturated.\n-Chrome is freaking terrible on android tablets. Using Chrome Beta has been a God send and it's obvious that they are working on the performance issues. Honestly, it's just shameful that they would integrate a browser that's horrendously slow, draws pages poorly, and crashes the entire OS.\n-USB 2.0 charging is just plain slow. Prepare to wait for it to charge overnight.\n-I'm not a fan of the unified UI. If you use an Android phone it's very similar and uses the navigation buttons can be a PITA (now, they are centered instead of on the corner).\n\nConclusion: 4.2.2 has really sorted this thing out. It is phenomenally responsive and manages to eek out great battery life. Google Play is finally pushing tablet apps and the functionality of Android lets me manage my media server, files, and remote computer sessions without an issue. Very pleased now and I'm glad they took feedback to heart on the buggy performance after release."}

More and more apps are upgrading to android on tablet status which is promising.\n\nThe display is stunning.  I find myself just staring at it.  The clarity and the color make it easy on the eyes.  Books downloaded from Google Play are so easy to read because of the 300 ppi.  Magazines look sharper that on print.\n\nIt's a strong little workhorse.  It runs the highest quality games and apps out there with ease.  Movies are no problem.  And as I previously mentioned, it all looks amazing on the screen.\nI've also been running the device over my HD projector and the sound through my speaker system.  It operates and looks amazing at 120\".  Especially apps like Google Earth, it looked fantastic so large and the detail is astonishing.\n\nAs I write this I feel that I am only beginning to tap into the possiblities of this tablet.  I use it for school with my textbook, class notes and powerpoint presentations all on the tablet.  It has completely revitalized the way I approach learning (and being in my thirties I really needed a fresh look at school).\n\nIf I had to beat it up on any aspect, sure it would be nice to have a higher megapixel camera (although I would still prefer other methods of photography over holding a tablet, so it doesn't really matter to me and it's so easy to transfer high quality photos to the tablet).  Not to beat a dead horse, but the photos I have transferred to the device from a high quality camera look amazing on the screen.  It is now my preferred method for viewing photos.\nOne could also make the argument that it should have an expandable memory slot and although I have not encountered the need for more I'm sure that some will.  But the alternative is to upload all that you need to the cloud and view it over the device via the internet.  That suits my needs.\nThe charger is somewhat slow, but I charge overnite and have not encountered any inconveniences.  I am interested in the POGO port on the device. I'd imagine that a POGO charger will eventually be on the market which should solve anybodies charging issues.  Like I said, I don't have any issues, but the magnetic breakaway charger will definitely be a sought after item.\n\nAlso, having the multiple users is a definite plus.  Now my wife has all her own stuff and I don't have to deal with it. Major perk over sharing.\n\nI could go on about the tablet, but in an effort to restore sanity, I will cease."}

The tablet is made for media.  NHL Game center is flawless, the wifi is super fast and all the chatter about the GPU not being able to DRIVE the 300 DPI is totally unrealistic and seems totally fabricated.\n\nAs for the sound, well dual front facing stereo speakers are awesome and my movies sound fantastic.\n\nMoving on to Google Chrome, I have not tried that but I use Opera for browsing anyway so them issues are mute for me.\n\nNow the important thing, Paring the sucker to my phone so I can TEXT on the massive screen instead of my Samsung Avail.  Tablet Talk lets me connect my phone to the tablet using Bluetooth so I can text right on my tablet since it does not have 3g connectivity.  My response, spend the $2.99 and get the app.\n\nOh and some people wine about the lack of storage on the device..well there is an app for that to.  Nexus Media Importer!  Just use your computer to load your external storage device with whatever data you want, photo's, music or dvd's and tada, your watching them on the Nexus 10!\n\nSo in conclusion, you may get a crappy device that just does not work but I didn't.\n\nThere are work-a-rounds for every issue people come up with and some people just like to complain.\n\nHope this helps."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "Along with many of the other reviewers here on Amazon, I too was plagued with bugs on my Nexus 10 on Android version 4.2.1. Chrome browser would suddenly become unresponsive and eventually would lead to a crash and restart of the entire tablet to resolve this problem. HOWEVER, in the last few days, I have received the updated version of Android 4.2.2. Since receiving the update, I have not had a single instance of crashing or unresponsiveness on the tablet! This is the beauty of having updates straight from Google (the reason behind a \"Nexus\" branded device)! With a Nexus device, you will always have the latest software updates directly from Google within 3 days of it being released! You can't possibly beat that experience. The problem that most people have on other Android tablets and phones is that manufacturers like Samsung, Asus, Archos, LG, HTC, etc. all add their own features on TOP of the pure android code. This means that when a newer version of Android is finally released by Google, these manufacturers must take the code all over again and re-optimize their software to run on top of it every time! As I'm sure you can imagine, this is an arduous process that takes a while for the manufacturer especially when that manufacturer has to do the exact same thing to every one of its devices on the market. This leads to tablets and phones that remain on old software because either the company is still working on re-optimizing their overlay OR they simply decided to stop updating the devices because it's too much work to keep up with each and every one of their products. In the sense of Nexus devices, this is never the case!! Nexus devices run on PURE Android software with NO overlays. This software comes directly from Google and whoever built the tablet is NOT allowed to add any of their own proprietary software on top of the device. Google will have full control of what happens with that tablet. This means that you will ALWAYS have the latest and greatest features from Google IMMEDIATELY (1-3 days) after it is released!! Please use this information to help you decide on your next Android experience. This goes for the Nexus 10, Nexus 7, Nexus 4, and Samsung Galaxy Nexus (GSM version). I WILL ALWAYS BUY ONLY NEXUS DEVICES as doing anything else means my product would  literally be \"old\" within 6 months (which I know everyone hates.)"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I purchased the Nexus 10 from the Google Play store which was an easy and fast transaction.  The tablet is actually east and fast itself.  Unfortunately, it acted with a life of its own.  It would often restart itself under random circumstances.  After the third time I thought it might be because of an action I was performing, but I began note what I was doing at the time of each restart and soon realized that it was indeed happening at random.  I thought that maybe I had received a bad tablet but after a bit of research, I found that there are other Nexus 10 owners experiencing the same problem (Here's a link to one forum: [...]\n\nThere may be a fix as of the date of writing this review, but I've already sent the Nexus back to Google.  I've owned both Android and Apple tablets and both are quite enjoyable, but I have to say that Apple iOS is definitely the more stable operating system.  As far as apps go, each system has their gems.  The DSLR Controller app is very cool and is an app that Apple doesn't have yet.\n\nThis was a really great tablet other than the restart issue.  The screen is out-of-this-world beautiful.  It's really amazing how they can pack so many pixels into such a small screen.  This 10 inch tablet has the same screen resolution as a 27\" iMac!\n\nOverall, this is a good tablet that could be great.  Based on my personal experience, I cannot recommend this to friends."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "The Nexus 10 is an absolutely wonderful device.  I've never been a huge Apple fan, but I got an iPad 3 prior to my Nexus 10.  I was impressed, it was certainly a very nice device and it really made every day life much easier.  I greatly enjoyed using it, and was very impressed.  Then I got the Nexus 10.  It was coming out around Christmas time, and I've always been a huge fan of Android and the customization that is allowed.  Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed.  Now, the Nexus 10 isn't the perfect device, but it shows a lot of potential to be so in the future.  Now, before getting to the actual review let me point out that it costs $100 more from Amazon than it does in the Google Play Store.  So please, save yourself that money.\n\nPros:\n\n+ The display.  It comes with an episode of Life on it so that you can test out what everything looks like, and boy did they pick the right thing type of video to give.  It looks absolutely incredible on the Nexus 10.  I really can't say just how good it looks, but when you see it in person you'll be amazed.\n\n+ The ability to customize it any way you want.  I'm a huge fan of being able to get things to look just right.  Android gives me this ability, and the Nexus 10 takes full advantage of it.  With lots of widgets now supporting the ability to have their sizes changed, it does wonders for the look and feel of the tablet homescreens\n\n+ Google.  This may seem like an obvious one, but because it's so deeply integrate with Google everything syncs with everything.  This makes it a breeze to add items on a computer or phone and have them show up on your tablet.  It's especially helpful for to-do lists, calendars, contacts, etc.\n\n+ Always up to date Android OS.  Android is infamous for having different devices on different versions of their OS.  But, Nexus is always the first to receive new updates.  For things like Google Now, it's amazing.\n\n+ Battery Life.  I can get about 10 hours of streaming Netflix on my tablet while having a bluetooth device connected to it.  I'm not sure how this compares with other tablets, but I've been very impressed by how long the battery lasts.\n\n+ Customer Service.  I had a small problem with the first tablet I received (which I'll go into in the cons section), however Google agreed to send me a new tablet after being on the phone with them for about 15 minutes.  Not a refurbished tablet either, a brand new one.\n\n+ Feel.  The tablet feels very sleek, it's a comfortable weight, and it's not bulky.  This is something that's more to be expected, but it could certainly ruin a tablet if it didn't apply.\n\n+ Micro HDMI.  While the Nexus 10 looks great by itself, sometimes you just wanted to watch it on TV.\n\nCons:\n\n- The charging time.  It still runs on a 5 watt charging cord, and as such it takes forever to charge up.  If you charge it every night then it's not much of a problem, but heaven forbid that you run out of charge and need to continue using it right away.\n\n- Charging bugs.  When I got my tablet it would sometimes power off when plugged in or removed from the charger.  This wasn't a huge deal but was very annoying.  In addition, the battery function would give false readings sometimes.  I talked to Google and they agreed to send me a brand new one.\n\n- No Micro SD Card.  I find this incredibly frustrating.  I have the 16gb version, and I like to keep some video files on my tablet for things such as working out.  Needless to say that bites into most of the storage.\n\n- Battery drain in standby.  While the battery life while doing things is great, it does seem to drain quicker in stand by then Apple products do.\n\n- Tool for actually doing work.  I have a bluetooth keyboard hooked up to it, and that does work well.  However, it's not a replacement for a laptop as much as I might want it to be.  Now, I didn't really expect it to be but it would be nice if it was.  It's not quite there yet, though they do make a good effort at it.\n\nOverall though I greatly enjoy my Nexus 10.\n\n4.5/5"}

They are going to slap me with a 15% restocking fee, and it's been over a month since I've returned it, and no refund yet. I will have to contact my credit card company before they will probably refund my money. I am not an Apple lover, and I thought the specs looked better than the iPad 3, so I made the decision to buy it. I was so sure that I'd love it, that I threw caution into the wind and accepted the fact that I would take a significant hit if I had to return it. When the Nexus 10 arrived, I was in denial for the first week. I kept making excuses for it when I tried to show my wife how cool it was. \"It's okay honey, it must be the Internet why the youtube video keeps lagging. It must be Youtube's fault.\" Random shutdowns \"It must be the program. It can't be the tablet. Google's name's on the tablet. They said it was awesome. It can't not be awesome.\" I had purchased an iPad 1 to test some software that I was developing. I had a realization moment when I reached for my iPad 1 over my brand new Nexus 10, I knew I had a problem. The iPad 1 had such a smoother experience, and youtube videos played fine without lagging. No random shut downs, no dropping the WiFi. Mind you, the iPad 1 is like 3-4 year old now. I had enough, so I sent it back, and I'm going to pay around $85 to return if after they gorge me with all their shipping fees, restocking fees, and misc fees to return it. I learned my lesson.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I don't know about you, but whenever I see negative reviews shouting things like \"It's TERRIBLE!!!\" or \"BUYER BEWARE!!!\" I immediately assume there's something quite wrong with the author of said review. I mean, we're talking about big name, heavily reviewed products made by some of the biggest and most dependable names in technology, surely the product couldn't be THAT bad, could it? Well, sadly, in the case of the Nexus 10, it most certainly can.\n\nFirstly, I'll explain my background. After using all Apple products for a few years, I switched over to the Note 2 for my cell phone of choice, and immediately fell in love with both Android and Samsung's impressive set of features on their Galaxy devices. Thusly, I immediately began looking for a similar tablet experience.\n\nOriginally, I was quite hard set on simply picking up a Note 10.1, since it's essentially a mirror image of the phone I've grown to love so dearly. But negative reviews regarding its screen resolution and \"clunky\" Samsung-produced software, had my shy away from picking one up.\n\nInstead, the Nexus 10 immediately caught my attention, with its numerous accolades and raves about its ridiculous 300dpi contrast ratio as well as its \"pure\" version of the Android operating system. And hey, I figured, it's still manufactured by Samsung, so it's gotta be good, right?\n\nUnfortunately, upon using the Nexus 10, I found the true abilities of the Tablet to be starkly different from the praises it was receiving from reviews. The screen is gorgeous, the \"pure\" version of the Android operating system is easy to navigate and quite snappy, but I quickly found myself more frustrated with the product than at all pleased.\n\nThe major issue that ultimately caused me to sell my Nexus 10, was that it began to constantly freeze and reboot itself. Not just once in a while during particularly strenuous. processes, but literally multiple times during normal use every day.\n\nLooking at the Internet, I found that this was hardly qn isolated issue. Dozens, if not hundreds of error reports have been filed with Google since its launch in November, and thus far, Google has yet to address the issue in any capacity.\n\nSome people are claiming its a glitch in the GPS software, others say the Facebook app is to blame. Personally, I'd say it appears to be that the unit's processor or video card over taxes itself and ends up crashing the Tablet. Whatever it may be, as far as I'm aware, there is no definite fix, which makes for an extremely frustrating and futile browsing experience.\n\nI also found that this issue of over-taxing the processor extends beyond the crashing issue as the overall smoothness and speed of my tablet rapidly deteriorated after the first few weeks of you. Especially when using apps like Flipbook, my tablet would suffer from constant freezing often rendering the apps totally non-responsive.\n\nI even found myself disappointed with the Nexus' bare bones Android operating system. While initially it makes for a clean browsing experience, I quickly found myself yearning for the additional apps that Samsung packages with their Galaxy products; after experiencing the cutting-edge technology of Samsung's S-Pen, multi-window browsing, and out of the box Photoshop programs, having none of those features on the Nexus left me feeling extremely hampered and unable to achieve the type of browsing experience I was accustomed to with my Note 2.\n\nOverall, despite the lacking nature of its OS, I would say the Nexus is a pretty solid tablet, with an incredible display, a wonderfully designed casing, and great processing power. Unfortunately, it's software flaws, and it's fatal rebooting issues render it nearly unusable. I would highly recommend looking at either the Note 10.1 or the Kindle HD 8.9 as an alternative."}

I have plenty of other chargers in the house and they don't do the job. Samsung nerfed it. Totally inexcusable.\n2) The battery life is disappointing.

The Nexus 10 screen was gorgeous, Jelly Bean 4.2 had lots of neat features and the build quality was excellent so I quickly learned to love my new tablet.  That is until it started misbehaving.  It began with Chrome becoming unresponsive to touch inputs followed by a spontaneous complete shutdown and eventually a reboot.  Once it had rebooted, I continued to use it but Chrome kept on freezing up to the point of being unusable. I did some research on the web and discovered that these behaviors were common with the Nexus 10 and the latest version of Jelly Bean. So I reset the device to factory defaults in preparation for a return.  However, the next morning I hated the thought of returning the tablet because it was so nice minus the software/hardware hiccups so I reinstalled all my apps and updated them all in the hope that maybe the bad behavior was a fluke.  Not so.  Chrome began locking up again so I reluctantly returned the Nexus 10. I am disappointed but I am willing to give the next Nexus 10 a chance, hopefully with less buggy software because the rest of the experience was very positive."}

The only chance of connecting to a wireless network was when I was within feet from the router and even then it would drop the signal.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "The tablet has nice lines, clear screen, and is light to hold. That is about all of the positives I can think of at the moment. The negatives are: The volume button placement and screen on/off makes no sense. Plus, volume up/down is backwards when pressing it. The lack of a physical home button is quite annoying as well. The battery drains very quickly for a tablet. The tablet crashes at least once a day and requires a hard reset in order for it to work. I bought this, sold my iPad 2 and now wish I had not. I love my Samsung Galaxy S3 and Android more than Apple, but I cannot stand behind this product. I would wait to purchase a different model Android tablet or stick with iPad."}

She kept putting me on hold while she looked up information to find an answer to my question. After 5 minutes and numerous times on hold I gave up. Later I received an Email from her with her explanation of how to resolve the problem which clearly indicated that she had not listened to me. Before calling, I read the documentation for the Nexus 10 and spent considerable time on-line to find a resolution. I finally figured out the solution to my problem, no thanks to Google support or documentation.\n\nOther than no support to speak of, I have been using the Nexus 10 for about 3 months. I am very happy with it. It is well designed. I have found all the apps that I need. I found a work around for the lack of support for the Flash Player, I installed Firefox and downloaded the Flash Player from a third party site and installed it (works alright in Firefox but not supported by Chrome). The only negative is the support. Hardware and software I would rate a 5."}

Now that I have used it for a while I will condense it into something easier by eliminating everything I said before and just getting to it:\n\n1. A tablet will NOT replace a laptop for web surfing. The Nexus 10 does a darn good job of being a backup internet source but for having to type in web pages, etc, its not that user friendly so you will really need a laptop for home use and this for travel or other.\n\n2. Google Play, the online store equivalent of Amazon, is worlds ahead of Amazon is usefulness and ease of use. Searching for books, music, movies is a snap. Everything is loaded into their cloud but you can PIN things to be actually downloaded to your Nexus for like using on a plane withoug Wifi availability.\n\n3. I already know that this is going to be great to travel with versus lugging a laptop around. I'm taking books, movies, all my music in one small package. You can also use if for e-ticketing, to travel with an electronic boarding pass.\n\n4. Uploading your own music is a piece of cake. Picture is bright and clear. Reading is effortless, and the sound of the music player is impressive. You can easily hear the speakers from 25 feet away so its not toy but its not your surround system either!\n\nLast, knowing what I know now, I wish I would have bought the Nexus 7 and 10 instead of the 10 and the Kindle Paperwhite. Again, searching for books in Amazon is like having teeth pulled. I wanted to have both to avail two book stores and two buying options."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I am an avid tablet user. I began with the original iPad and continued getting the Apple iterations on future launch days. Of course I was impressed with Apple's offerings but something just felt.. missing. I switched from using the iPhone 5 to the One X+ on AT&T but returned that and got a Nexus 4 (which I also love). I feel that while Android may not have as many optimized apps, the Android OS is miles ahead of iOS in terms of functionality.\n\nSo here I am with the iPad 4, bought just 7 months after I bought my iPad 3 (shouldn't these by at least a year apart??). I decided to jump ship and try out the Nexus 10. And boy, am I happy I did that!\n\nPros:\n\n-Gorgeous display, in every way. Viewing angles are wide, text is crisp as can be and the contrast is stellar (from a tablet perspective, some phones are better).\n\n-Speed. This thing flies. No lag or observable hiccup anywhere. Coming from Android I definitely expected some hiccups or dropped frames, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\n-Weight. It is light-weight. I have no problem using this with one hand holding on from the middle while in landscape. I hardly ever use it in portrait.\n\n-Speakers. YES! I don't understand why anyone would ever choose to put speakers on the back. I love how the tablet looks with the speakers facing you and on both sides. Symmetry!\n\n-Gaming abilities. Every game I have tried runs flawlessly. Mind you, I place relatively simple games. No shooters or racing games here. Mostly puzzle, side scrolling and such. Spirit HD is my favorite game.\n\n-Browsing. While the bundled-in Chrome is lackluster in a number of areas, the AOSP is incredibly smooth. I notice no scolling lag or checkboards here, even when there is Flash on the page!\n\n-Battery life. Easily lasts two days of my moderate-high usage. Mainly browsing the web or something.\n\n-Updates. Since this is a Nexus tablet, you can be sure you will get timely updates to the OS.\n\nCons:\n\n-Tablet optimized apps. This is just a shame, really. Most apps don't use the space effectively, I am hoping this changes since Google launched their own tablet.\n\n-Charging. Battery charges slowly, plus it actually loses power when I am playing a game and have it plugged in. Maybe a dock or magnetic plug in will charge it faster.\n\n-Chrome. The built-in browser is a huge let down. Consumers that are new to tablets will be very disappointed with this. Make sure to get a different browser from the market (Ocean Browser, Boat Browser).\n\nOverall, it is of my opinion that the pros heavily outweigh the cons.\n\nIf you are in the market for a tablet, I would not hesitate to recommend this product. I am in love with it! This tablet is great and will only get better."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I bought the 32G version of this tablet 6 weeks ago and have been enjoying it, for the MOST part. I will not cover anything spec-related (processor, lack of SD card slot, brilliant screen, etc) but will focus on my general user experience.\n\nLet's start with the good. Even though there is a bit of a learning curve for 1st time Android users, multitasking and feeling in control of your experience is phenomenal. What I mean by that is you feel like you are taking the most efficient route to get to where you want to go, made possible by the multitasking button, Google Now, and the notifications bar. The tablet is also very sturdy and ergonomic and the speakers are just awesome to listen to since they're front-facing. Battery easily lasted me 2 and a half days of moderate use and no charging.\n\nThere honestly are not any huge issues with the product itself, just many little ones that accumulate and severely bring you out of the great user experience Google has provided with Android. After a day of use, my tablet froze and restarted itself. I thought I was using it wrong, but this kept happening at least once a day for the next two weeks. The restart only took 15-20 seconds but completely took me by surprise. There is a bit of light bleeding in the lower right corner of my screen. Again, not a big deal, but it makes the N10 not feel like the premium product that it tries to be. Wifi connection, when compared to my laptop and Galaxy Note 2, is inconsistent even when right next to my router. I've stopped watching youtube videos altogether because of this which is a shame since the screen is so beautiful. There are plenty of apps for Android phones, and even for tablets, but not for 10 inch tablets. Half the apps I use on a daily basis are just blown-up phone apps, especially Facebook, which looks absolutely atrocious on such a large screen. The list goes on and on, but you get the point.\n\nAs an avid Android enthusiast, I really really wanted to like the N10, even getting a replacement thinking it would fix the problems I was having with my first one. But the problems kept persisting and though they could be fixed by OTA updates, I couldn't help but feel cheated. This hardware-software combo was clearly not ready for prime-time and at the end of the day, I was the guinea pig. I will be using my replacement for the next week and will try to cling to a reason to keep it but if you're on the fence about getting this product or an iOS tablet, I would go with the latter.\n\n---Update---: After a full month of using my tablet, I stand by my original review, for the most part (I never caved in to get an iPad). I've found that the app selection isn't as lacking as I thought and many popular apps available for iPad have near-clones on Android. What is still very annoying is the constant restarts. I don't think I've ever been able to use my N10 for more than 2 hours before the tablet either decides to freeze or restart spontaneously. So, as of right now, this is still a 3-star product.\n\n---Update 2---: It's been a week and a half since my N10 device received the update to Android 4.2.2. The performance is slightly better with freezing being less frequent, but the problem still appears from time to time. (About once every 2 days of medium use). After using it to take notes in some of my classes, I recognize that it is not a BAD tablet. However, everything is relative, and the value proposition of the N10 compared to some other tablets (iPad, Windows 8 tablets, Note 10.1) is noticeably inferior. It's the jack of all trades but the master of none."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "So far I have owned several tablets, iPad 1-3, Blackberry Playbook, Galaxy Tab 2 7 and 10.1 inch, and Nexus 7. Nexus 10 is arguably the first Android tablet in the same league as iPad.\n\nThe good:\nNoticeably thinner and ligher than iPad 3. This is the main advantage I think. Thinner and lighter is always better. One main gripe I have for iPad 3 is that it is a lot heaver and thicker than iPad 2.\nScreen is very sharp, my eyes can not tell the differences between iPad 3 and Nexus 10, Nexus 10 does have higher DPI though.\nThe rubberized back provides good grip. iPad's back is kind of slippery, a cover is almost mandatory.\nSound quality is much better.\n16/9 is much better for watching video.\n\nThe bad:\nNexus 10 feels much larger than iPad, in fact it is a lot narrower, but much taller, which gives the perception that is kind of big.\nHolding with one hand on portrait mode feels fine for a while, but with the weight the hand gets tired soon. Holding in landscape mode definitely needs 2 hands due to the width of the tab. And the\nwidth makes it hard to reach with your thumbs to contents in the middle part of the  screen.\nSpeed wise it is mostly good. However iPad is still more fluid. Try the Google news web page, just rotate the tab you will notice the differences. Also when I tried to scroll up/down, many times I could feel lags, and some times the screen did not respond at all. On iPad 3 the scrolling lags are also noticeable, but never not responding. But most web pages are ok.\n\nThe thing I hate most(for all Android tablets with 4.0 and above):\nThe bottom bar is present all the time(youtube can hide it though), even when you play games. In landscape mode, it takes a whole 1/10 of the screen for no purpose, it is a huge waste, it also makes the screen feel unnaturally narrow..\n\nThe bottom line:\nMy main use for iPad is browsing. For that iPad's 4/3 ratio is much better. If you watch a lot of video, then Nexus 10 has advantages. So the choice depends on usage. Also the price and preferences for build material. But if you have kids, iPad is arguably the only choice, the selection of educational apps on iPads is unmatched."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "I want this review to be about the Nexus 10--I know it's easy for a lot of people to immediately start comparing it (especially to the iPad) but that's not helpful, if you want to do that, then your mind is made up..go buy an iPad. (Mind you I'm not a fanboy--I own about 9 Apple devices and 6 Android devices, I use all sorts of platforms and OS)\nMany of these reviews are touting why the iPad is still better or other better options--I'm here to tell you my experience with this thing and why I love it.\n\nSo here a few things that I have found most important (note there isn't terrible detail but as I note at the end, I will answer any questions you leave):\n\nDisplay: The Nexus 10 packs an awesome display (in fact so far as PPI Resolution is concerned, it's the best on the market *mind the date). It is VERY bright. It just looks good. Note that once resolution gets to \"retina display\" quality the human eye can't pick out much of a difference. All of this being said, I transferred a ripped version of my Pirates of the Caribbean DVD onto the thing and it looks great. I have yet to rip a BluRay on and watch it, but I am very satisfied with the picture. I don't see any of the bleeding problems that others may have noted and I have had no issues with the display whatsoever.\n\nBattery: There have been some complaints about battery life from other reviews. I don't see these problems at all. My wife and I both own a Nexus 10 and we both get a regular 10 hours out of it (if I'm away from wifi I turn it off, otherwise it's always on. I also adjust the brightness depending on what I'm doing). I only use the tablet about 4-5 hours a day (heavy use) and I can go about two days between the usage and the standby time before it needs a charge. The charge is another matter--it is SLOW. It is very slow. I just let it charge overnight or else it's too easy to get impatient with it. Once it finally does charge, however, the battery doesn't concern me.\n\nStorage: This is the only thing that I don't really like about the Nexus 10, the limited capacity. I'm in Law School so my budget forced me to the 16GB, it's still plenty of room since I keep a video library on my desktop and most documents on my laptop, but I can see where the smaller memory with no expandable slot could be a problem for many. There is definitely a push to use the Google Drive and other Google cloud options and if that works for you then don't worry about the size--it's plenty big, otherwise the limited capacity is something you need to consider.\n\nPhysical Quality: It's a keeper. My wife who hates electronics and technology pulled hers from the box and commented just how light it was and how nice it is to grip. Even without a case or cover, there is nothing cheap feeling about the tablet. Some may say that the plastic detracts from it's value or appeal, but I have to differ. The plastic on the back makes quite a nice grip and the entire unit feels very sturdy in your hand. The speaker placement should also be noted--they face the front of the tablet. I've seen plenty of other tablets where the orientation or just holding the tablet can cover the speakers--not an issue here.\n\nOverall: I'm not going to get much more detailed than what is listed here. These are the things that concerned me when sorting through tablets to see what to buy. As far as Android tablets go, I think this is the best on the market right now. It is also important to remember that this will see OS updates faster than many other devices since it is pure Android straight from Google.\n\nBecause of my budget and my overall anxiety when it comes to dropping a considerable amount of money on electronics, I can say that I did my research and I am very happy with this purchase.\n\nIf you would like to know further details about something I mentioned here or you just have a question you would like an unbiased answer to before you purchase, please leave a comment and I will respond as quickly as I can."}

The second day that I had it, it just shut off while I was using it and it wouldn't turn back on. After calling Google Play customer service, I found out that it had gone into a deep sleep and that I needed to hold the power button for 20-30 seconds to turn it back on. After this happening several times a day, I decided that I needed to call customer service again. Google Play passed me off to Samsung which was a total joke. I got passed from department to department and no one wanted to help me--or even had a clue how to help me for that matter. Some of the people at Samsung that I talked to didn't even know that Android 4.2 existed. Neither Samsung or Google play wanted to take responsibility and told me to take it back to Walmart....I didn't want to do this because I knew they were out of stock and that I wouldn't be able to get a replacement. After hours on the phone, I took it back to Walmart and ordered another one from Goggle Play, now if something goes wrong, Google will have to replace it. I'm not giving up on this tablet yet, it being such a new device I understand that there will be hiccups. My new one will be here tomorrow and if all goes well I'll increase my rating."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "Let's be clear, this a great Android Tablet. There are a few big flaws to note before making the investment.\n\nGraphics are great, and rival the Ipad easily. I love the floating apps on Android that allow you to multi task, unlike the ipad. Sound and multimedia are spectacular.\n\nThe major flaws to note are\n\n*Battery life is horrible (around 5 hours)\n*Chrome freezes and reboots the tablet (happens quite often).\n*Integrated web video other than you tube vids do not play as well as the ipad when web browsing.\n* The Bezel is just way too big and ugly.\n\nOther than the flaws above, it's a great tablet. If you're torn between this tablet and the ipad, it all depends on what your needs are. I prefer thsi tablet because of the multitasking. For example, I can watch the news on a pop up video browser and still brows the web or read my e-mail. You can't do that on an ipad. Android also has a file system, unlike Ipad (or apple).....\n\nOn a side note: I previously owned, the Samsung Note 10.1 and it's is a much better and tablet all around, however the resolution on the Note 10.1 is meager at best. If the quality of the display isn't a big factor for you...go for the Galaxy Note 10.1, you'll be happier. For me, it was all about the display which is why I chose to get the nexus 10."}

Screen resolution on paper is better than the new IPad, but in reality it's no better than IPad.

I will identify that I purchased the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and comparing the two is simply unreasonable. They will remain this way because the intent of both companies remains completely different. The Nexus 10 is simply a beautifully engineered, well thought out, designed tablet. The unrestricted operating system lends full featured functionality to this device, as it should. I haven't had one bad experience with this device since opening the box. I've read a previous review in which the owner had multiple problems. I wouldn't waste a moment and return the defective device for replacement. When I first opened this device, I was immediately drawn to the fact that the speakers were designed so that they faced the user. This may not seem very important to most but believe me, the audio produced by most any tablet is going to be sub-par by a true audiophile's perspective but this will always be due to the limitation of the device size and space. However, having said all that, since the Nexus 10 speakers face the user, it's a huge benefit and one I shall give kudos to the designers. The screen resolution is beyond expectation and the results are breathtaking. I chose to use wireless keyboard and mouse and both paired immediately w/o a hassle of any sort. Some may wonder why one would choose to use a separate KB & mouse with a tablet, simple, I hate finger prints on my screen and the oily residue left behind. I will never fit into today's trend of touching a screen for input (sorry Win 8 fans) my phobia. The apps available from the Google Play store are increasing all the time and the developers know that they are not restricted by limitations within the device's OS. There is speculation that a Nexus 10 dock will be available soon and also have additional USB ports and charging of course. If your serious about an Android tablet, this is the one to seriously consider."}

(Sorry about the others having problems.) I really like the Jelly Bean operating system better than Apple's iOS. (I also have an Ipad 2.) Yes, it is a little slow in charging but nothing I can't live with. I'm sure they will tweak it. Screen is beautiful & browsing is first rate. Highly recommended!"}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "Bought this tablet (32GB version) from Wal-Mart since it was not available on Amazon or Google Play or pretty much any other retailer. I've had this for 10 days now and I'm very impressed by the customization options and the open world of Android. I am a first time user of an Android device and I've owned an iPad before (which I wasn't very big fan of and eventually gave it away). So the world of Android is a welcome change for me from the walled garden of Apple. This tablet is also very advanced and the things you can do with this are amazing. I've installed Flash and can be used using Boat browser or Ocean browser. Used and messed with it every day for the last 7 days during the holidays and found it really interesting and with lots of potential.\n\nHowever, will be returning my device because of the umpteen problems I've been having with it.\n\nLots of positives about this tablet, which I read from other reviewers (mainly from the Tech websites) and what prompted me to buy it in the first place. So I won't be listing those here and I will only focus on the problems I've been having.\n\nA few to list -\n\n1) Freezes/hangs and crashes every day, multiple times. This is by far the deal breaker and I'm so disappointed by this. This happens all the time while switching apps, opening browser and doing random stuff. This is worse than the blue screen on Windows or the gray screen on Macs. The frequency with which this happens is so annoying. Totally unacceptable by today's standards, especially for a $500 device backed by Google/Samsung.\n\n2) This is also a big deal. I'm having intermittent authentication issues with WiFi connection and it drops randomly. My 10 or so other devices at home doesn't have this problem at all and its definitely something to do with Nexus 10. Sometimes it also says its connected via a proxy server and refuses to connect to the internet. This is solved by restarting the device. But nonetheless, very annoying.\n\n3) Choppy playback using YouTube app (this one is weird because it doesn't happen when I use a browser to access YouTube or while playing HD movies I downloaded from the Play store). It comes with a free (Ice Age) HD movie and it plays fine with the player. I'm so surprised by this. Using Dolphin browser I am able to play YouTube perfectly and hence this is probably an issue with the App itself (tested it several times).\n\n4) Light bleed from top left corner and it's very visible during dark scenes or black background. This is also a known problem and you can find it in several forums.\n\n5) Poor battery life and very slow to charge. It shows the battery charge stays the same while using the tablet and plugged into a wall outlet meaning it doesn't charge properly while in use. Not sure if it actually charges and just shows the percentage remaining as the same. While not in use it takes 6-7 hours to charge from 30% or so to full.\n\n6) Display is good on the screen with most PPI of all devices, but colors/black level not as good as other tablets. The resolution is great don't get me wrong, but check it side by side with other tablets and you will see why PPI is not the only metric you should go by to rate a display.\n\n7) Non-existent customer support from Google/Samsung. I tried calling the 1-855 number for Google device support and they acknowledged some of the issues, especially the crashing of the tablet and Wi-Fi dropping. They told me to call Samsung and gave me another 1-800 number to call and ask for a replacement. They said my replacement won't have any issues and all problems have been fixed. Samsung told me to return it to the seller or try rebooting, resetting etc. I'm not taking any chances given the return policy on computers/tablets is only 14 days.\n\nI really wanted to like this tablet and it's so full of promise. If everything worked properly this is probably the best tablet device and OS in the world. But unfortunately, it isn't or at least until Google stands behind their product and tries to make it right.\n\nI still want to get an Android tablet for the tons of customization options and open platform it offers, but the device has to be stable & reliable in order for me to enjoy and make use of it. I would avoid this until the second batch comes out with rectifications for all the above issues. Search on xda-developers/Android forums and you can see no one is sure if this is hardware or a software issue.\n\nUntil they figure out all this, stay away."}

I can only guess why Amazon would jack up the price so much. Anyways, this tablet ROCKS!!  It has the same processing innards as the Samsung Chromebook. It's very fast and fluid. The display at 300 pixels per inch is just amazing. The 9000 milliamp/hr. Battery lasts all day long. The forward facing speakers sound good and seem to be plenty loud. Reading magazines like flipboard are just gorgeous! HD movies are beautiful, I can't say enough about how nice the screen looks. There is no SD card slot, so I recommend the 32gig version for sure. With Google play, there is plenty of song storage available. I am hoping that we'll be able to upload movies soon. Apps like SketchBook Pro are a lot of fun. I haven't tried the cameras but should  be decent. The advantage over the iPad I think are 1- Price, lots cheaper. 2- The 16:9 ratio screen is better for watching movies. 3- the forward facing speakers sound better.\n The build quality is great. It's thin, light and has a nice back on it that is easy to hold. It has the gorilla glass that is tough as nails. The only thing that I wish, and it more to do with Google , not the tablet, is that there were more accessories available for it already. They are coming but should be available now I think and hopefully everywhere. Anyway, that's about it. I love this thing and heartily recomend it to anyone."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00ACVI202", "review": "They put all this muscle in the device  and cheapen out on the GPU. I just don't get It. Can we have at least one manufacturerer, build a SOLID (all-around device), and not rob from Peter to pay Paul? So aggravating.\n\nTegra 3 is the GPU that Google play and the developers are building premium quality  apps from - thus setting the standard. They are absolutely gorgeous. Without the Tegra 3 chip you can't enjoy these apps. What makes it worse - more and more of these amazing apps, are rolling out,  on an every day basis too.\n\nThe nail in the coffin though is no Micro Sd card. You have amazing tablets such as the Asus Infinity, that can harness up to 128 gigs in a Sd card for more storage. A deal breaker for me.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nYet another reason the Tegra chipset blows away the current GPU chipper in the Nexus 10\n\n[...]\n\nJust copy & paste..\n\nThe Nexus is going to be \"old hardware\" in the coming months.. The Tegra 4 has games already developed. They will be showing them off at CES 2013 tomorrow. This chipset is the future for gaming. And will boast the fastest browser speeds in the world as well."}
