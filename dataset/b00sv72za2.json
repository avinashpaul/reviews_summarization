{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "This is unquestionably the worst laptop I have ever owned. There are simply no redeeming qualities about this latop. The hard drive is slow. The processor is not only dual core but also painfully slow, the graphics chipset can barely handle Windows 8 let alone any Linux distribution, the ram is dreadfully slow. I replaced the stock hard drive with an SSD and the computer was still incredibly slow.\n\nI could see this laptop being decent back in 2003 with Windows XP, maybe. But for 2015? Don't even bother with this one."}

It is very slow for being brand new, the screen is nice and large but it's also flimsy all around. The keyboard is weak, you don't have to apply much pressure for the whole thing to give in. I'm not a fan of windows in general. If you are making a movie and need something cheap to blow up, this is the product for you!"}

It's cheaper than most laptops on the shelves.\n2. The screen is pretty good, good for long hours of sitting, good for overall video quality, not the best screen, just good.\n3. It lasts for a bit. (really had to reach for this last pro here.)\n\nCons:\n1. It's reeeeeeeeeeeealllly cheap, that means they left some stuff out to make it cheaper. This includes important things like a disc drive (so good luck watching movies and better pray to god a company has a download for their set up software some where on their website.)\n2. It's hardware is very out dated, this leads to difficulty running most modern programs, like google chrome for instance (kind of important.)\n3. It has a really big typing lag. It sometimes takes a nice couple of seconds for what you've typed to appear on screen.\n4. Oh by the way the intel core processor has updated several times over the last couple of years, and this is a really bad version of it.\n5. Who uses windows 8.1 anymore? If so, I feel really bad for you.\n6. Oh by the way its possible but really difficult to update hardware (because it's not made to be updated)\n7. Oh by the way my battery has started to die at random points while using, even if the laptop says it's at full battery.\n8. I'm really surprised that my laptop hasn't fully died yet.\n\nMoral of the story children, don't buy this laptop. Stop being cheap asses and go spend 600 or more dollars on a laptop. OR buy a PC."}

After 9 months of use it died. I sent it back under warranty for repair and was told a power supply connection had come loose on the motherboard but that they had repaired it. Upon return the operating system would never boot properly. Shortly thereafter the computer would power on but only had a black screen. (Also, when ASUS sent it back they neglected to send the charger back and it took 2 weeks and a dozen phone calls to get it back.) I finally took it to a local repair place and they discovered the entire motherboard was bad. I have since read numerous reviews that this is a common problem with this model. The cost to replace it is nearly the cost of the laptop. So it's totaled, in other words...and I have a $270 piece of junk. ASUS customer service and warranty repair is terrible, they didn't help at all when their product failed."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "I can only say this about the Asus X551MAV-EB01-B(S) since this is the one I have. A friend of mine bought it for me for some strange reason and would not take no for an answer. as you can see in other reviews, this is a basic laptop only good for the mass markets for ordinary users who don't do more than basic computer use. In fact this is much slower than my older core2duo laptop which has a cpu running under 2ghz so even the turbo 2.7ghz of this don't mean much in real world use.\n\nNow I recently got a lexar jumpdrive USB3 pen drive. A badly designed device but has the potential to beat great product. On receiving it, I jumped to plug it in to see just how great that product would be. I just plugged it into the USB3 charging port socket like I do all my other pen drives but I heard a crackle like a short and the laptop powered down. The green power light as well as the charging light went off and would not turn back on. Nothing I did showed the laptop having any life left in it and after fiddling with it for a few days decided to use it for parts. I could not sell it or dispose of it as it was an important gift and I wanted to at least keep the case as a memento of our friendship of a half a century.\n\nNow to take this apart you need to go find reviews and videos showing you how to do it. There are things to watch out for as the keyboard, power and mouse uses plastic hook ons which can be easily turn out and the plastic tabs on the connectors can be easily broken and you have to be very very cautions to not do it since you would never be able to fix it. The 3 connectors makes taking this part very hard but it can be done if you know where they are and how to do it so important you learn the process..\n\nNow you don't really need to disconnect the LCD display cable, it is taped onto the connector on the motherboard, But if you have larg hands you might have to remove this as well. The other 3 connectors are much easier to disconnect as well as the wifi module but you can just unplug the wifi module form the port and don't need to disconnect the antenna leads as they are also hard to reattach later. Also need to remove the battery.\n\nAfter removing the screws and the connectors, place the laptop upside down so the motherboard sort of falls off. You have to pry the battery and it is a battery holder found in all desktops. Just nudge the clamp and the battery can be removed. Now after a minute you can try to connect the AC/DC adapter power cable back to the motherboard and the green light should come back on...\n\nIf the green power light still don't come on, wait a day or so and try again or it is some other problem. I had everything in pieces so it was much easier to do this but taking everything apart would be much harder to put back together. I measured the voltage and such and found that the motherboard was still getting power but it was being stopped. Having the laptop battery attached and removing the backup lithium battery won't fix this as the battery would still provide power to what ever configuration is being stored. So this took almost a week to figure out. It was only a fluke that when I had it all in pieces that I plugged in just the DC adapter connector and the power on light came back on. Until then the laptop battery itself was connected and it showed no life. The spare motherboard costs as much as the laptop itself so not worth replacing it like that. Even without the DDR3 module attached and such would still show the motherboard coming back to life..\n\nI think this is a safety measure of the charging port and the asus charging program. An overload on the port would shut down the laptop and can only be fixed in the service center.. So you don't even need to use a badly designed connector to cause the problem but also a fast charging device that takes as much current as the laptop provides. And I have had to do this twice now.\n\nYou should take pics to sse where all the screws are and such so you won't end up with spare screws once you put everything back.. Make sure the keyboard work properly and such after assembly. It is quiet hard to reattach those 3 flex cables in the end. But after 30 minutes of careful fiddling I was able to see the mouse and keyboard working. And the laptop powered back on and went to the windows 10 login screen..\n\nWhew.. My wife uses it for basic things but other than that, this is not really worth the effort. But I was just glad that it had not died just a few months after receiving it. As he had died, the laptop also dying like that was a huge blow to take and although I was not able to help my friend I was able to revive his gift made me feel much better.. Who would have thought the backup battery would prevent the laptop from even powering or charging the thing."}

I got this one using an Amazon gift card, looking for the best thing I could find for what I could afford. I felt like I was taking a bit of a risk getting this one, but it ended up being perfect, what I would expect from a $200-$300 laptop. It's reliable and can run game emulators smoothly, as well as .exe games. It works like new, and I haven't had many issues with it, besides for some viruses that were my fault because I wasn't being smart with my downloading, and was easily fixed with some anti-malware programs.\n\nOnly thing I would caution against is upgrading to Windows 10-- it will constantly try to upgrade, and throw up pop ups warning you to save your work because it will automatically upgrade unless you indicate otherwise. I finally upgraded, it took several hours, and I hated it so I downgraded back to Windows 8.  Save time and don't upgrade windows, the cake is a lie.\n\nAnyways, great laptop for a good price. I highly recommend it, especially to those on a budget!"}

I fell down the stairs with this computer (no joke) and the only thing that changed was the condition of the body. Just recently, I spilled water on it, and the screen is funny, but perfectly functional. Honestly, this is the best laptop i've had. It has been my best friend for the last 2 years.

Games run even better now with DirectX 12 out. I can play Minecraft at moderate settings, Amnesia at max settings, and pretty much and Source engine game at max setting. The speakers are quite loud and of excellent quality.\n\nGonna be honest. I've replaced the keyboard twice. The keys, or \"chicklets\" as this one uses, are incredibly hard to replace individually. In fact, it seems that no one on the internet knew how to do it. I ordered a whole new keyboard, opened it up, replaced it, and discovered that this laptop is quite empty. There is no disc drive, and the space where it would be is full of lattice like plastic. Meaning it would be difficult to shave all that away and add one, but it could be done. You could add larger memory, but with no room for other improvement, don't expect to deck out or overclock this laptop.\n\nAfter one year, I have done some damage. I have cracked the plastic by the NumEnter and the keys/chicklets keep falling out, never to be replaced again. The usb ports, both 2.0 and 3.0 are finicky and randomly disconnect. That's really bad when its and Elgato and it disconnects your stream and ends your recordings. If you are not live streaming or doing anything vital, it's a great laptop for just watching movies and YouTube and Twitch, but not great for making movies, YouTube or Twitch."}

The initial issue was that it wouldn't boot at all, and you had to do a \"hard reset\" by holding the power button in for 60 seconds before it powered up.  This issue continued to occur after the laptop was returned 5 months ago when they replaced the board.  Now it won't even power on after the hard reset, and ASUS states that a.) it's out of warranty as of two months ago and, b.) there is only a 90 day warranty on replacement parts.

Since when did laptops start coming without DVD drives?? Oh, thanks apple!  this was not much of an issue though because i could install Ubuntu from a usb drive. I kept one laptop with with the free Windows 10 Upgrade, and my other running Lubuntu.  I've had less problems with the Linux laptop.  With windows you will be waiting forever for upgrades and it comes preloaded with a bunch of useless software.  The biggest problem i've had with the laptop is the mouse trackpad not responding or acting haywire.  Another drawback is that you have to remove the entire bottom of the laptop if you wish to upgrade it in the future (if thats even an option)."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "Works great! I'm very happy with my purchase. I use this as a spare computer and also play Lord of the Rings Online with it. It is a little slower than my Alienware  X51 (I knew it would be) but the graphics are quite nice in the game. Graphics look just about as nice as on the Alienware X51. It's just a little slower loading.  I'm thinking it could handle most games within reason.  Not sure I would want to do any heaving raiding or such on it but I mostly play solo and it serves my purposes quite well. It does not get hot at all. I even bought a fan just in case as I intended to have the online game running for hours on end...it's cool as a cucumber and runs very stable. I've never had to use the fan and it has never overheated. In fact the onboard fan is always doing a sufficient job and I can feel cool air constantly being pumped through it.\n\nOnly 3 things about this computer that I wasn't crazy about - all of which I knew about in advance and was able to correct.\n\n1) it comes with Windows 8.1 so you have to endure the LONG download to get Windows 10 on there. And I'm not kidding - it's a long download. Very long download. Very Very LONG download.  I let it run over night and finished it in the morning. Just FYI - It didn't look like the download was working as the progress bar wasn't updating. Just leave it alone if this happens to you. It's working in the background. I read online that many people have experienced this. Just let it go and it will get done eventually. Come back and check it tomorrow. No really, it takes that long. LOL But it installed without any issues.\n\n2) No DVD player. I knew this when I ordered so it wasn't a surprise. Only needed it for one program installation and I was able to use an external drive. Just be aware that it does not have this if it is something that you will need.\n\n3) it does not come with an Ethernet cable so if you want a wired connection for gaming you will need to invest in a cable. I had asked this question prior to ordering and didn't receive a response so I went ahead and ordered a cheap cord as well. Was glad I did. I suggest you step outside the box and buy a bold RED cable like I did. Cause everyone likes red better than the standard beige or white cords that everyone else uses. :-) LOL  Actually I bought a red one so I could clearly see which cord was going where in the octopus of cords around my desk...."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "Bought this cheap laptop for my 12-year old grandson as a Christmas present. Although it comes with Windows 8.1 I figured it was a good value. Before I gave it to him I spent a few hours upgrading it to Windows 10. Microsoft just keeps bugging you if you don't upgrade and I didn't want him to have to deal with that B.S. The upgrade went flawlessly and this laptop ran great under Windows 10. I didn't remove the Asus bloat-ware but I should have. My grandson used his laptop until February and loved it until he managed to install enough \"so-called games\" that he had it totally infected with virus' and malware. It became unusable at that point because of constant pop-ups and other virus symptoms. In retrospect I never should have trusted Microsoft Defender as the anti-virus program. OK, lesson well learned, I'll never use that useless piece of software again.\nFrom here on things worse by the hour. I took his laptop home to restore it back to the factory configuration. Asus says this is easy, just press F9 with the power button and the process will start. NOPE! It just kept booting the infected Windows 10 OS. Then I created a bootable flash drive with the Sophos antivirus program to clean it up. Just hold down F2 and power to enter the BIOS and reset the boot device to USB. Three times I tried to boot from the flash drive. I wouldn't work. A day and a half into my \"easy cleanup\" I was still spinning my wheels because this laptop would not perform the easy tasks that the Asus documentation and a dozen YouTube videos said would work. In utter frustration on day #2 I kept at it, trying every BIOS setting variant that I thought might get the darn laptop to boot from flash drive, when without warning it actually started the ASUS recovery utility that failed to load with F9. So here I sit, 21% into restoring this thing back to Windows 8.1 without any of the user files created since Christmas. I'll have a very disappointed grandson, but it's his own fault for downloading whatever it was that infected this laptop in the first place. OK, enough of my horror story. Let me get on with why I only give this laptop 2-stars:\n\nPRO: T\nThe hardware is solid and well built. It stood up to a 12-year old boys abuse for two months so far. He hasn't been able to break anything, and believe me he can break stuff, his phone, ear buds, glasses, door handle in my pickup. So ASUS gets 3 stars for hardware quality only.\nCON: Here's where I deduct stars...\nNO  CD or DVD Drive. Why? Without an optical disk of some sort obtaining necessary software like antivirus, Office, etc. while not impossible becomes quite difficult. I'll never ever buy another computer without an optical drive. I consider it a necessity.\nSupport; there is none. The ASUS web site is next to useless, forcing you online to YouTube, user forums or so-called expert web sites to search for your own solutions to problems.\nJunk software, this laptop comes full of it. Most of it useless at best.\nVirtually non-functioning system restore option. You need to create a system restore disk the very first thing yourself, but without an optical drive how can you do that? I'll be working on that question myself later today but I'm not holding my breath right now.\n\nSUMMARY: I still give this laptop 2-stars because it's fairly fast, well built and cheap. Would I buy this model again? \"NO\", not unless it cam with a DVD, recovery disks and a real manual in the box."}

It is very deceiving when there is a plastic shaped cutout where the drive should be.\nIt is lightweight, which is a definite plus, and it is Windows 10 compatible (which I did the upgrade as soon as I could).\nAnother con is that it doesn't come with all the other updates that Windows says is important.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "I will preface this review by stating that I do work in IT and instead of building a custom system, I have decided to purchase a laptop outside of Apple for the first time ever. I will explain everything below.\n\nI purchased this laptop for my wife. She only needed a limited, but daily usable laptop for basic entertainment (youtube, other video sites for our newborn son, etc.), along with being able to run the essentials like OpenOffice, etc. Well, this thing was pretty stellar for those uses for the few days that it DID operate. After exactly 3 days of use, it would not boot up. We got the new form of BSoD (blue screen of death) associated with Windows 8.1 and higher. In our case, for Windows 10.\n\n\"DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (storahci.sys)\" was the exact error, then it would go into \"Diagnosing Your PC\", then it would give me the \"BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO\" error and let me restart which would take me through the same loop.\nBasically it crapped out after VERY minimal use, both in length of time and amount of load.\nAnd the degree of how crappily it crapped out was FAR too worse for me to have any sort of want to repair this.\nSo I just recently returned it.\nSo lets's talk briefly about how it worked:\n\nRegarding functionality of the laptop for the short time we did have it up and running:\nScreen resolution is as expected, not THE BEST, but not anything I would complain about.\nBrightness is even, no light leaks or mura of any sort.\nVolume is actually better than my MacBook Pro (which isn't saying much but still), and surprisingly not \"tinny\" as I had expected.\nThe keyboard was a bit softer than the ones i'm used to working with but I mainly work with Apple hardware as an engineer and tech for engineers.\nIt wasn't soft in a bad way by any means, but after a few minutes of using it and adjusting, it was actually pretty good.\nI tested the WiFi on both 2.4ghz and 5ghz frequencies and it connected seamlessly and connection was solid from across the house and a floor away.\nIt was a bit too light for both of our taste because there's no optical drive but that's to be expected for the aforementioned reason.\nThat about covers the gamut of our limited use and exposure of this laptop."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "After reading the reviews on this product, I thought it would be a solid choice for it's intended use, really light office use (By really light, I mean on for less than an hour a day, mainly for presentations via Chrome Cast and light internet use.).  My purchase was made on Cyber Monday, 2015.\n\nAfter unboxing this laptop, I noticed that it's construction seemed flimsy, but that's to be expected with a lower tier laptop.  Performance on the laptop when in use was a bit slower than what I'm typically used to, but again, a lower tier laptop, that's expected.\n\nWhat wasn't expected, however, was the troubles we started to receive the next day powering the laptop on.  It appears that the way the power button is constructed, you have to mash it until it eventually turns on.  This wasn't an isolated incident, and came back as a complaint from myself and my staff frequently over it's course of use these past two weeks.  Another issue was the display, which appears to be reiterated by a couple of other reviewers.  It would flicker on and off , colors would change, and sometimes, it would shut off completely for 30+ seconds.\n\nUltimately, based on these early hardware issues I didn't feel comfortable the laptop would last for a decent life cycle (At this rate, 6 months felt like a stretch).\n\nI'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because it could have been an isolated incident with my model, and the speed / build quality were expected to be lack luster due to it's price point."}

Well it's going back. Can't say it's s***ty. I might have just got a lemon. Ill probably get a HP or Toshiba next always had good luck with them"}

I got it about three days ago, and now it barely works.\n\nIt will not play any videos now (that I have saved). It says loading for a bit and then quits. The programs also crash rather quickly. Nothing works for a long period of time. Recently, the sound quit playing in general (I had every volume system up the whole way). My headphones and earbuds now won't connect because the laptop can not tell when the devices are being plugged in and the program that connects them will not pop up so I can select  if they are headphones or a headset. In general, nothing is working. Also, the desktop icons do not stay in place. I will put all my icons on the top of my desktop screen, and when I come back they are all over the place. My programs also crash quite often (which they did not do on any other computer, for they are the exact same programs).\n\nA few good things about this are that it has good resolution, and the keyboard is easy to use and the keys do not stick. The webcam isn't really grainy, but the microphone could use a few improvements.\n\nWhen I got the laptop, everything looked nice (there were no stratches or marks on the surface or screen). The screen is actually rather large, and the laptop itself is not very heavy."}

ASUS laptops are all reasonably priced, serviceable, and this one has a good sturdy case, ease of use, crisp screen. You cannot do better for the price  I'm however giving this computer two stars, to send up a flare.  ASUS is dangerously unwise in its choice of software partners. I want to warn you about that bundled software, and explain what to do with it.\nFreed of it, this is one great computer.\n\nFirst, any ASUS computer comes bundled with McAfee, yet always works far faster and cleaner if McAfee is removed and Malwarebytes plus your favorite anti-virus software is substituted. Because of new bundled software, ByteFence, this one arrived almost as a coaster. I eventually spotted it and figured out the fix. My notes....\n\nFirst day: Rugged little laptop, good screen. Something's wrong, the bundled software a usual. Laggy as heck. The laptop will not allow downloads, whether I use  IE or Chrome. I cannot switch to Firefox or use Malwarebytes or Advanced Uninstaller because I cannot download. ASUS advertises free Windows 10 update on this version. Cannot download Windows 10 either.\n\nPurportedly the computer needs 175 software updates! A new \"anti-malware\" program, BytesFence, is moreover acting strangely. Suspect strongly that ByteFence software is the source of all the problems.\n\nI'll dig it out and see...\n\nUPDATE:  I removed ByteFence. (Decided not to simply uninstall Bytefence from the computer's own Control Panel, since pieces can be left, but that would have worked. Came in from a thumb drive with Advanced Uninstaller.) Advanced Uninstaller got it. Installed Malwarebytes which found 13 PUPS. Where did they come from? With ByteFence out, the computer is suddenly running fast and smooth. I can download. Great little laptop, really like it.\n\nCannot however download Windows 10!\n\nRemoved McAfee, substituting AVG....Windows 10 now downloading smooth as glass. [Did a custom not express install on Windows 10. Otherwise Windows will collect all personal information and use it for ads, broadcast it to everybody.  Good upgrade though]\n\nIN SHORT: Terrific computer for the money. Beware though the software bundle!!!! Remove McAfee and ByteFence either through the control panel [Uninstall Program] or with Advanced Uninstaller, which is freeware, Substitute Malwarebytes free trial and AVG freeware. Computer now really cooks."}

The buttons tend to stick regardless of how clean under the touch pad is.\n-The touch pad has no separate buttons. This means that when you're clicking, there is a good chance that the mouse will move while you're finger is on the mouse button. Mucho no bueno.\n-Made of really cheap plastic.\n-You cant easily remove the battery. This is A HUGE PROBLEM. Come on, techies, what are you supposed to do when you get liquids on your device? YOU REMOVE THE BATTERY IMMEDIATELY. With the way this laptop is set up, that's impossible to do before water can do its damage.\n-[edited in] I forgot to mention that the touch pad sometimes registers the opposite mouse button click. Sometimes I would try and left click an item and the computer would register it as a right click. I've already ruled out the possible driver problem. The problem is in the design of the touch pad.\n\nAll in all, I would NEVER buy this thing again.

The integrated GPU is terrible, with no upgradeability\n-Only 4GB of shared RAM\n-touchpad is terrible. Buy a USB mouse.\n-my unit's keyboard is warped.\n\nI recommend this computer for school, work, and light gaming."}

I live overseas and for me is very difficult to obtain anything after purchase, but the risk is on me. Guys, there are plenty of brands and computers that offer much more capability but I guess I stepped into the famous brand that ASUS is supose to. Honestly, not very happy with this. The keyboard is hard as a coconut, to upload the operating system with \"4GB RAM\" it last more than 30 seconds (not normal), the videocam pixels a bit on skype (but thats not very relevant for me).

I could not live with the mediocrity and Windows 10 literally crawling, if I were multitasking in any way. With the upgrade, it is quite nimble. The RAM can be replaced - it is very tricky and taking the mother board out of the internal battery is painstaking. The challenge is in remembering what screws came from where - they are different lengths and sizes. Fortunately I marked the tray when I was dismantling. As long as I don't run into any issues with the hardware, I guess I am OK. It serves the purpose.

I have had this computer for about a month now and have had no problems with it. Yes, occasionally I will hit the hot key and disable the touch pad mouse. OMG all you have to do is activate it again by pressing control F9. But seriously I have overclocked this laptop and just use it for work diagnosing big rigs and checking email. Amazingly fast for the specs for the crappy ram output and hard drive rpms. I would buy another if I run this one over. well worth the few pennies to dollars spent rather than a thousand dollar laptop for the same thing. OOOH and no CD driver FYI but what can't you download offline or just use a usb memory stick and omg transferred files. Too simple these days to get everything without a CD drive no big deal to me. It is flimsy and made of hard plastic so don't think you can rough house this computer like a tough book.\n\nI AM RATING THIS A ONE STAR BC COME ON PEOPLE WHO READS 5 STAR RATINGS. I KNOW I DONT.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "For the price, you get a laptop that will get you connected to the internet.  It comes with Windows 8, which basically makes it the worst computer out there to deal with.  If you buy this, immediately upgrade to Windows 10.\n\nPros:\nNot expensive, good sized HD, big screen, does basic comp work.\n\nCons:\nTo work, you must set up a microsoft account for basic functions.  Don't expect Word on here...only a trial of the cloud based OFFICE, which once again, you have to make a microsoft account for.  Want to search online? Too bad, the Explorer web browser is horrible.  Get anything else downloaded asap.  Next is the keyboard.  If you type well, or quickly, you will find yourself yelling at this laptop. It cannot keep up with your typing speed, and many times, the key does not register the letter you are typing.  You will find yourself having to backspace a ton.  Lastly, it's so slow.  I can't figure out how a brand new computer can already be as slow as a computer that is bogged down with years of saved crap.  Opening up programs (which are already on the computer new) or files from a flash drive (since you DONT GET a cd drive) takes a crazy long time.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if you are on a budget, or if you need a burner laptop for general use, I guess you can get this.  But if you need a laptop for actual work, or school, I would NOT buy this.  I almost feel like this is something you would find at Toys R Us.\n\nUpdate: 01/2018.  By far the absolute worst laptop money could buy.  Slower than anything you can imagine.  The computer that powered Apollo 13 is probably faster than this machine.  I cannot fathom how asus could even allow this horrible product to be sold!"}

When I got the package it literally came with 2 manuals and the cord. No CD on start up and all that extra crap. The keyboards are fairly smooth and they are spaced out enough where its easy to type. They aren't mashed together like some laptops. Also to I paid $285 for this because of all the tax, just thought I'd mention the actual price. The battery last for about 4 hours.\n\nTHIS DOES NOT HAVE A CD ROM. The picture lied to you. This laptop has 1 sound speaker, 2 USB ports and 1 HDMI port. That's it. This laptop is extremely simple, which I like a lot.\n\n*ANOTHER IMPORTANT DETAIL: IF you're planning to install a whole bunch of advance programs like After Affects or Photoshop or Illustrator only install like 2 or them. The computer doesn't have THAT much space for big programs. I have MangaStudio 5 and it runs fines. It also takes drawing wacom or Intuos tablets as well.\n\nSo far, so good. Really enjoying this lappy."}

Visiting different websites for homework was mediocre at best, and I had good Wireless strength.\nA couple of days later, I got back on it for more browsing, and even simple websites such as Google loaded at the speed of dial-up. Not to mention that the computer and its programs had went unresponsive several times.\nThis evening, I started it back up. Boottime was excellent. I put in my password to my Microsoft account, and I sat watching the spinning dot-wheel thing, and all that I saw was \"Welcome\" for several minutes. It never booted into the start menu. I packed it up and have asked Amazon for a refund after only one week. A total waste of $300, but at least I'm getting it back.\nMy tip to anyone who considers buying this is, don't be cheap.

Because of the poor qualities of the laptop, and the fact that I got my SP3 running again, I decided to return this computer. Attempting to watch anything on this computer resulted in a terrible sound and choppy performance. As a college student, I don't need the best device in the world, but I definitely need something that can handle daily tasks, and this computer cannot. It's worth spending an extra hundred on a different device.\n\nThis laptop is ok, at best. I bought this as a speedy replacement for my surface pro 3, that was having some difficulties. For its size, the weight is very light, and accommodating. The screen is a great size, and the full sized keyboard is a bonus as well.\n\nThat's where the positives end. The sound on this model is crummy, often sounding scratchy and fuzzy. The RAM memory is very low, therefore making the computer slow and sometimes inefficient. Running antivirus and Edge at the same time put a lot of strain on the computer. This model does not come with an optical drive. That isn't a killer for me, since I use cloud-based technology now, but for others, it is a problem.\n\nThe verdict on this is that it would be great for someone that doesn't need it to watch videos, or use this for heavy entertainment. It would make a great writing device, with the full keyboard and large screen."}

It handles multi-tasking acceptably, has decent speakers, charges pretty quickly (and has a well-designed charger), and stays cool. If it were a little faster and the battery lasted a little longer, it would have gotten 5 stars. It lacks some \"creature comforts\" - could use another USB port, a better design for the charge port, a touchpad with more defined click buttons, and some indicator lights for Num Lock and Caps Lock. The keyboard is good for typing, but the laptop surfaces will take fingerprints.

At under $300.00 some reviews posted here expect everything that $750.00+ have. That is way to much to expect for the price. However it accomplishes all the tasks I want from a portable laptop. I have no need for an optical drive. The only negative for this laptop is the touchpad. Not what I am use too. I am more comfortable using a mouse so a wireless works well. Only one each of usb 2.0 and 3.0. I have a portable cooler which has extra usb 2.0 ports so it is not an issue for me. As stated in many other reviews this laptop is designed for affordable portability/student use. If you want a laptop with multi usb's, high quality optical drive, outsanding gaming ability then look to pay for it. After all if you have a home system built for serious gaming and computing power costing thousands...why would you even expect a laptop costing a few hundred to evan come close? My total investment for laptop, cooling pad/stand, wireless mouse, portable back up drive, and carrying case is under $400.00. Should it get lost, stolen, or beat up I'm not out much money. If the touchpad is a prime concern there are plenty more laptops on the market. Do your research and do not buy one because it looks good. Excellent product Asus!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "For starters, this review is being made with 1 weeks worth of ownership time.\n\nThis laptop was purchased purely with value in mind. I have a desktop already, but I was in the market for something mobile with a Windows OS that would get me through classes. Overall I can honestly say, for a brand new laptop, its pretty good bang for you buck. This does not mean it is not without any flaws, but rather you must accept the shortcuts taken when in this low-end market. While not blazing fast, and in no way truly comparable to an i series chip...this little guy is still an Intel and can handle all your general processes just fine. Yes it can handle some light multitasking without any real hiccups. Yes it can handle Photoshop and light Illustrator just fine. NO you will not be rendering and editing resource intensive videos on this. Yes you can even do some light gaming (minecraft and anything else it meets the requirements for), but you really shouldn't be having extended sessions of it. Its simply not made for it (in terms of cooling and the longevity of the processor). All in all, it gets the job done as long as you understand what your getting, and if you can somehow add a SSD you should get a pretty nice little boost in performance.\n\n- Value\nThis really is probably the best only thing worth truly noting about this laptop. I bought it for $240, and for that price It boasts so pretty decent specs that are going to handle you day-to-day tasks without a problem.\n\nCONS\n- Hard Drive\nIn its defense half a TB is a solid amount of storage, and its boot time out the box really isn't unbearable by any means. That said, the 5400 RPM rate was still just far too slow for me. It's probably because I'm so used to my desktop solid states. Regardless, I had to swap it out and put in a SSD.\n- Lack of ports\nDoes offer HDMI and a single USB3.0 port. Still only 2 USB ports total and only a 10/100 Lan connection.\n- No optical drive\nReally, this wasn't a big deal for me as I have an external drive if I absolutely need it. But, how often do the majority of us really use discs these days anyway.\n- Nothing is removable\nI mean absolutely nothing. If you want to replace something, which would likely be the HDD or battery, you have to completely unscrew the bottom and pry the top cover/keyboard off, which is actually fairly difficult. (see photo)\n- No keyboard lights\nMore of a nuance, but other than actually seeing what is being typed, there is no visible indication light for Caps/Num Lock.\n\nSomehow all these cons are bearable when you keep the value in mind!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "This is an adequate low cost machine, but some better design and component choices might have significantly improved it.\n\nFirst, it comes with Windows. I don't know why people still do this since Linux just works and is a better system. I haven't yet upgraded it to Linux because I haven't had the time and I've read that a few of the components don't yet have proper drivers. I know there are workarounds that will be sufficient, and eventually I'll get around to doing that. But for now Windows is minimally adequate.\n\nAnd some severely retarded person must have been in charge of the trackpad. There aren't separate buttons for the mouse so I'm constantly right clicking when I mean to left click, pinch-n-zooming when I mean to move the mouse and then left click, and did I mention gestures? I damn sure don't want gestures - that's a pretty ridiculous idea that overrides your intent with those of someone who clearly has never used a trackpad before. And the trackpad isn't in the center. It needs to be in the center, which would make it easier to find the buttons properly.\n\nThe keyboard could use some refinement as well. For one thing, can we please get keys large enough for a grown man? Like 120% of the \"standard\" size. My hands aren't huge for an adult male, but they are large enough that I'm constantly having to edit mistypes. And of course the Ctrl key sticks sometimes, which is always surprising me like when I'm trying to scroll and it won't because the ctrl is down. I use the Ctrl key a lot, so this is annoying. And the arrow keys NEED to be physically separated from the other keys so you can feel them properly. I'm often hitting the left arrow when I want the up or down arrow, which wouldn't be a problem if I could feel which was which. Also, the keys could have more depth and better \"feel\" - they should have a clicking feel when you press them - that makes it easier to move your fingers over them to find the right key without accidentally pressing them. I actually chose this machine in part because most of the other keyboards in this class looked even worse (half-height arrow keys? WTF?).\n\nThe screen could be a higher resolution, but then this is a low end machine so asking for more isn't really fair. Same with processor power. Both are good enough for the price.\n\nThe power button is also not as good as it should be. Its hard to find in the dark and a little too close to the Esc key."}

Another thing that bothered me with this unit is that it does not come with a standard size ten key pad. It's smaller than the standard size. The spacing in between them is way off. The speakers are surprisingly good. The onboard mouse pad isn't bad either as it functions a lot like a smart phones' screen. You can zoom, scroll, etc by pitching,  swiping."}

Or run using the touch pad, wireless.\n\nBattery works well. Battery charger included and has long cord.\n\nThis is my proofreading books in bed at night and traveling computer. Needed something so I may change my posture, location when using computer. I stand when working on my desktops. Tension gets into the neck after 8-12 hours day.\n\nBox it arrived in is a carrying case, has a sturdy handle for carrying laptop in the box. Will buy a smaller case on Amazon. Not too heavy, I keep it in a rolling airport mini cart.\n\nCD works. USB flash drive ports work.\n\nBuilt in camera, mic. Camera is ok but not best clarity, speed.

For a low cost laptop it's fine, and the price when I bought it was low so I didn't expect a beast of a machine, however, the blatant pixelation is quite annoying.

Its a great price point, a little on the slow side though so don't expect this to be a pc gamer's dream. For low intense computer using I would recommend this. It served my purposes of web browsing, writing, and doing coding projects for school. Screen is a good size, decent graphics, smooth keyboard, but a slightly noisy mouse clicker. I don't use one of the usb ports because it sticks to whatever is put inside it and makes it hard to remove.\n\nHowever, 4 months into using it, one day it just wouldn't turn on. I had never had any problems besides some lagging once in a while. So it was very surprising and I thought it would be a huge hassle to get it fixed. Turns out it was an easy process. I went to Asus's website and filled out a form saying my laptop wasn't turning on. Afterwards they sent me an email with instructions on how to return it and what info to include. So my husband put it in a packaging box along with some paper forms and the charger. Then I mailed it from usps for around $15. Within a month they had it shipped back to my home in perfect working condition with the charger and all my data intact(I was worried about that). They even sent me a form saying what the problem was and what they replaced. It looks like they replaced the motherboard and the battery. It works like new and I'm glad it turned out to be a pleasant experience from Asus. That's why I rated it 5 stars even though it broke down on me.\n\nThis experience does make me want to buy an extended asus warranty on it though, just in case some other part breaks. But it works fine now and their warranty lasts for 1yr against manufacture defects so I may be fine."}

I love some of the apps, like the Health & Fitness one. Unfortunately this laptop has been a royal pain in the butt in the short (less than a) week I've had it. When it tried to run updates, it got stuck at 100% and wouldn't finish booting up. I eventually had to do a refresh on it, which removes all 3rd party programs and basically starts you over but preserves your files. After that it took overnight to download the updates again but they installed smoothly. Its been laggy and freezing up for no reason since the updates have been installed. The price was right but you get what you pay for I guess. I'm not overly impressed with this laptop's performance at all.\n\nUPDATE: I've had this for a little while now and while successive updates have gone smoothly, I'm still not that impressed. The touch pad for the mouse is awful. I do graphic design work part time and this mouse pad makes that impossible. It either doesn't recognize my touch or it jumps all over. The left and right buttons are actually part of the pad, so if you have moved the cursor where you want it, then tap a button, expect the cursor to move dramatically and probably not do what you wanted at all.\n\nAll in all, \"okay\" for price but invest in a separate mouse if you expect not to be frustrated by normal usage.

You can buy this laptop on the walmart app for $229.00 and I got it within 3 business days. Just a update I just found out by the Asus customer service that you have to download a software to be able to watch dvds. I was having a hard time trying to get the dvd movies to run as it wouldnt and they told me with this version laptop you have a download a software called VLC Media Player in order to watch dvd movies. Other then that, this is a great fast running laptop."}

It is a VERY NICE laptop.  Setup took about a half an hour. It was  very simple. I ordered this laptop KNOWING that it did NOT come with a optical drive. Seeing as though external drives are cheap enough that did not bother me a bit.\n\n  My first Windows update took about 2 hours (NO big deal) and went smoothly. I got the Windows 10  update icon on the taskbar and reserved my FREE update.\n\n  So far (3 days) the laptop is running great. It only took about 2 days to get used to Windows 8.1 (I'm used to Windows 7 and Linux Mint), it's not that bad to figure out and learn.\n\n  There is not that much bloatware on this machine and it took only a few minutes to uninstall what I didn't want. Go through the settings and configure the machine the way you want, it's very easy.\n\n  The laptop is very quiet. I installed a Staples 4 port USB hub and added a wireless mouse with no problems at all. Plug & play. I installed Firefox as I HATE I.E. and imported my bookmarks with zero problems.\n\n  I can recommend this laptop without hesitation. It works great. If you're looking for a high end laptop this is NOT for you. Do your homework and stop complaining because you didn't do any  research. READ  ALL  INFORMATION before you order ANY product so you know what you will get.\n\n  If you have questions about the NON optical drive version of this laptop just ask me."}

It also is easily confused with right vs left clicks. Easy solution is to get an external mouse. I also cannot get it to recognize my iPhone as a storage device and cannot download pictures from it.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "Computers are one of those items that can come with a lot of bells and whistles, but all that is pretty meaningless if you don't need them. Bells and whistles don't come along with this PC, but if you're looking for a budget model, this one is pretty decent and should meet your basic needs. It is worth noting, though, that it doesn't come with office, so if you're looking for a laptop for writing papers, plan on investing in a word processing program.\n\nConstruction-wise, this laptop is very light, which is both to its advantage and disadvantage. It feels pretty flimsy and plastic-y, and I'm not very confident about how well it would hold up if you were to drop it. On the plus side, though, it's not likely to break your arm when you're carrying it around.\n\nThe screen is rather nice. The display is pretty crisp and clear, so Windows, websites, etc. all look good on it. The display panel itself is as insubstantial as the rest of the PC, though, so it probably needs some TLC.\n\nThe keyboard is okay, but it doesn't have a good, responsive feel to it--no backlit keys and soft clicks here. Again, this has a lot to do with the light construction of it. There are no LEDs to indicate if caps lock and num lock are on, which is kind of annoying. The mousepad is all one piece, so if you need to click on something you depress the bottom left or right portion of the pad. Not having buttons isn't a big deal, and the mousepad works pretty well, but having buttons is nicer. The mousepad can be shut off if you want to connect a regular mouse.\n\nAs far as ports go, there is an ethernet port, a VGA port, an HDMI port, one USB 2 port, and one USB 3 port, so you'll want to plan accordingly if you'd like to use the laptop with peripherals.\n\nThe hard drive is split into two partitions: 186 GB for the operating system and 256 GB of free space. Windows 8 comes pre-installed, and the nice part is that it isn't too bogged down with random add-ons.\n\nSince it is inexpensive, this might be the perfect laptop for the kids to use. It doesn't have the hardware to run any intense games, but it should do nicely for playing online games, doing research on the internet, and writing papers (once you add a word processing program to it, that is.) For adults, it would do well for things like word processing, some bookkeeping, and Internet usage."}

Keeping that in mind let's take a look at the specifics:\n- Weight: surprisingly light, given the 15.6\" screen, I at first thought they might have left the battery out of the system\n- Size: 15.6\" screen again, but in wide screen format, ~10\"x15\" case, seems a little on the bulky side if you plan on carrying it around to classes, should fit into most normal sized knapsacks though\n- Display: 1366*768 pixels in wide screen, not 1080p but acceptable and delivers a good image\n- Processor: 2.16 GHz Celeron N2840 (dual core), remember basic system, you won't be doing heavy duty graphics rendering or speedy compiles on this system, but to stream some videos or music, play some basic games, or word process, the chip is capable, just don't expect anything miraculous (it can run games like World of Tanks, in minimum resolution reasonably well)\n- Network: I was a bit disappointed that the system would only connect at 2.4GHz, but remember, basic system, this will limit your streaming or online gaming, though it seems to work fine here in my house with top of the line multi-channel routers\n- Memory: 4 Gb, basic for Windows\n- Storage: 500 Gb @ 5400 rpm, basic again, expect to use either cloud storage add a passport drive\n- Connections: the usual network and VGA ports, 1 USB-2 and 1 USB-3 port (expect to need a USB portal or splitter, I use one port for the mouse - sure the case comes with a finger pad but you can't get real work done with one of those, and if you want to plug in a set of USB speakers you are done) I was surprised to see an HDMI port for connecting to a larger screen or TV (nice)\n- Software: preloaded with Windows 8 (yes, the abomination, the horror, and no touch screen, <soapbox> seriously, IMO, Windows 8 is a barrier to getting anything useful done, especially without a touch screen </soapbox>), and the plethora of trials and advertised crap (I spent my first couple of hours with the system going through the configuration of Windows that requires you to setup or provide an email account, and removing all of the preloaded trials, then installing Open Source protection software and the Chrome browser among other favored software)\n\nSo those are the basics and my impression. Overall, the system is usable, though it seems 'cheap' to me, especially the keyboard (it just sounds and feels flimsy. Also, given the limited amount of 'guts' inside the box, you would have though ASUS could have used a thinner case. So, usable, functional, a great selection for that teen that might need to take it to class or for anyone on a tight budget that has a need or desire for a computer. P-)"}

The only quirk I've found is that wireless won't connect when the machine is next to the router (but it works fine from 30 feet away)  It may have to do with the direction the internal antenna is facing.  I work around it with a wired connection.  Note that there is no optical drive and as near as I can tell no bluetoooth.  However, this is an inexpensive machine.  For the price I highly recommend it."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "I have owned two other Asus laptop computers in the past and was pleased with their longevity and performance, but this Asus laptop was a complete disappointment! On the positive side, the laptop was easy to set up with a Microsoft account and it walks you through the process step by step, which is great considering you don't receive any instruction manuals with this. I liked that it had McAfee antivirus software preinstalled. The built in camera worked great with clear images and I was happy with the sound quality of the internal speakers because the sound was crisp and clear.\n\nI'm giving it 2 stars for several reasons despite some of the features that I did like. Granted that the laptop is only $250 in value, so you can't expect top of the line quality, but I certainly expected better quality than what the reality was. The main reason that I'm giving this laptop such a low rating is that the hard drive, after 2 weeks of periodic use, completely crashed and died! When I turned it on, it wouldn't let me get past the BIOS menu (basic input output system), kept locking up, and wouldn't recognize or detect the hard drive, so I couldn't do anything on it. I removed the hard drive and attached it to a sata converter with a USB cable and tested it on my other laptop and it wouldn't start up or recognize its hard drive even on that computer, meaning it was dead and not fixable. Completely useless..\n\nAdditionally, the 500GB hard drive is small in size so you can't install too many programs and games and also can't store many photos because the hard drive gets used up extremely fast. You also will not even receive trial versions of software - this is so basic that it has nothing but the operating system and the antivirus software. Another issue I had was that it ran incredibly SLOW and I barely had any programs installed on it with plenty of hard drive space left. Even when I would type a document, it couldn't catch up to my typing speed and it would take at least 30 seconds or more for the words I had just typed to appear on the screen, which is quite frustrating when you are trying to get work done. After a week of use, the track pad completely stopped working! Granted that I was able to use a separate mouse, but that just speaks to the shoddy craftsmanship of this laptop.\n\nSteer clear of this cheap quality laptop and invest in one that has a bigger hard drive and is of higher quality because this is pure junk!"}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "Sept 4, 2015: I absolutely HATE this computer. This has been the biggest waste of money. The first computer would not load correctly and was extremely slow so I sent it back for a return. The new computer is just as slow. Its so incredibly slow I would rather carve my research papers in stone then have to deal with this computer. Of course it's too late to return it and there is no support for it. Now it won't even load past the BIOS utility screen. DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER. I can't even express to you how much I hate it.\n\nMay 7, 2015 (3 days later): Amazon has sent me a replacement and I've been using it for about 3 days now. I don't know if the first one was just a bust but I gotta say this one is MUCH smoother. It's still on the slow slide, but nothing like the glitchyness of the first one. Programs run smoother, websites load faster, documents open easier. I've upped it to 3 stars for now and will update again in a few months (or sooner if I have more problems).\n\nI HATE this computer. If Amazon had a decent return policy I would return it in a heartbeat. Stupid thing is soooooo slow. Issue I'm having now is Windows is trying to update but it's just stuck on the update screen. Can't even use the computer now! If you think you want to buy this computer save yourself the headache and just flush $249 down the toilet instead. I'm seriously surprised at the lack of quality from Asus. I should have listened to the other reviews. This computer can't even serve as a basic, browsing the Internet, reading email, computer. And forget anything that moves. Gifs? Absolutely not. Unless you have 10 minutes for it to load. YouTube videos? You're kidding right? Ads that move on the page? Prepare to not be able to use that page. If you are not getting on the Internet with this thing then it might be OK but otherwise BUYERS BEWARE!"}

Agreed.  On a typical power strip it takes up 3 sockets worth of space.\n\nThe 2nd star is simply for benefit of the doubt, as I do not believe my experience matches the dissatisfaction level of the other 1 star reviews, neither did I have the unit long enough to have experienced many of the issues there.\n\nSee my review on the Dell (yes, I said Dell)I got after consulting someone I should have consulted in the first place."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "This is a fairly slim and light 15.6 inch entry level laptop with specs and features that are more than sufficient for daily computing needs. Its a computer to consider if you're on a budget and want the most for the limited amount of money youll spend. It comes with a 1 year limited parts and labor warranty by Asus, which is one of the top computer manufacturers that is well known for quality products- Asus is definitely a good brand! Sure this model has its flaws being such a low-cost machine but you really need to spend at least 2-300 dollars more to just move up to the next level PCs. For how much you pay, its a good buy overall. Theres no need for an optical drive, the 500GB HDD with a speed of 5400RPM that offers enough space for storing all files, downloads, music, videos and software. You have the 2014 model Celeron processor, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD, a comfy keyboard with 10-key numpad, longer than normal battery life, a USB 3.0 port, an HDMI port and all the other basic but useful connectivity options.

This computer does both of those things acceptably well, and at a bargain price!\n\nWe installed Minecraft on the machine as a test, and it's playable, but it starts to feel a bit choppy when turning quickly or entering a heavily forested area. This isn't a surprise really, as this is positioned as an inexpensive laptop, rather than a powerhouse and uses integrated graphics versus a separate GPU. You'll also notice the lack of performance in the boot times which take several minutes, but the wait time is nothing too excruciating.\n\nPerformance drawbacks notwithstanding, what this computer includes for the price is actually fairly impressive; you get a decent-sized screen, built-in web cam, HDMI out, USB 3.0, 500 GB hard drive, 801.11n wireless and a multi-touch trackpad! The speakers were also nice and sufficiently loud, but ASUS' marketing oversells the \"SonicMaster\" feature as something more extraordinary-sounding than it is.\n\nI've paid this much money for a smaller, less functional netbook, so I was completely satisfied with what ASUS offered in this laptop.\n\nIf you're looking for a computer that can handle office apps, web browsing, (very) light gaming and one that comes with a good array of features at a price that won't deplete your kids' college fund, then look no further."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "Up date - Initially I did not have the Windows 10 update app on the computer and had difficulty getting it, so I rated the machine as 3-stars.  However, after about 6 months the app appeared in a Windows update, but Microsoft has still not downloaded it, but I am on the list to have it done.  I have therefore raised my rating to 4-stars.  I have, after more than seven months, had no reliability issues, so I feel that 4-stars is appropriate, so long as one does not expect more than a basic unit, with the properties described below,\n\nI found this to be a very good, basic laptop computer.  This is a budget priced machine that I think gives good value for the money, but lacks some of the features found on more expensive machines, which is discussed below.  I recommend this machine for light use.  It would be great to take to class, as it is relatively light for a large screen laptop, and being relatively inexpensive less of a trauma were it lost or stolen than if it cost three times as much.  I rate this machine 4 stars based on the fact that I had no problems with it and thus feel that it gives good value for its price.\n\nContrary to some of the reviewers that have had problems with their machines, I have so far (after eight months of light use) had no problems.\n- Setup was easy, and everything functioned as advertised, however, the machine does not come with any real instructions.  It comes with a small booklet that identifies the components on two small pages and the only real instruction is the admonition that you should charge the battery for 24 hours prior to battery usage.  Most of the booklet is taken up with the same information printed in numerous languages.\n- The screen is sharp and clear, with no lost pixels.\n- I have had no problems with the touch pad, although I prefer a mouse and have installed a USB wireless mouse, which I use most of the time, but I also use the touch pad when I do not have the space for the mouse.\n- I have had no problems with the keyboard and find that it is similar to that on a much more expensive laptop that I also use.\n- The wireless connection hooked up to my wireless router with no problems and after inputting my password hooks up automatically on startup.\n- The machine is made of plastic, which makes it relatively light.  The plastic appears to be relatively robust.\n- The machine ran for about 6 hours on a charge, based on light usage, internet surfing, checking e-mail, etc.\n- I had no problem with the speed of the machine, but then again it is only being used for Internet surfing and reading e-mails, so my speed requirements are not very high.\n\nWhat is NOT on the machine \n- There is NO optical drive (DVD or CD).  I found this to be a bit annoying as it prevented me from putting my copy of Microsoft Office on the machine, (I still have two legal installs left).  It also means that there is no installation disk or rescue disk.  However, you can buy portable USB DVD drive for about $25, so the fact that a drive does not come on the machine is not a real problem.  In fact, it is somewhat of an advantage as you do not have to carry one around all the time, or pay to have an internal drive, instead of purchasing a less expensive USB drive.  You can also work entirely with the cloud, so that a drive is not even necessary for many users.\n- The machine runs Windows 8.1.  This is my first 8.1 machine, and while I am not partial to this system, I did not find it to be completely useless.  I am still waiting for Microsoft to download Windows 10."}

If your some power gamer who needs the latest tech, this ain't it bub. What this is, for me anyway, is the convenient \"guest\" computer you stick in the living room for the kids or people who drop by and want to check email. It's there when you need it, but I would not make this my main machine. I would not stake my life on it.\n\nSome comments. First of all, they brag about the sound. The sound sucks. Second, it feels cheap/hollow/breaky. I would not want to drop this thing. Third, no instructions or manuals at all. If you've never used Windows 8, go online and watch some tutorials or you're going to be very very confused.\n\nAll that said, for the price, this is a good machine that will let you surf the web, check your email, run some programs, and hopefully last a few years before something fizzles out. Don't take it in the bathtub with you. Don't take it sky diving. It is what it is, but for the price I like it."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "It is perfect for the price point and intended usage: school and web browsing. Only downside is in trying to update system drivers as ASUS has apparently decided you can only go through them for drivers.  This wouldn't be too much of an issue if ASUS actually made some effort in keeping drivers up to date.  Having graphics drivers and system bus drivers 8 revisions and a year old does not make for a secure computing environment."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "In reviewing the ASUS 15.6-Inch Notebook, I found it necessary to keep in mind its price/spec ratio. It has all the basics, plus a comparatively large screen and a reasonable amount of RAM and storage. It also has some extras that are not always found in a laptop in this price range, such as the HDMI port (which enables using a TV as a computer monitor) and an extended keyboard which includes a numeric keypad. Some compromises are evident in that the ASUS is not the fastest computer, but for things such as email, watching videos, etc. it is more than sufficient. I would not necessarily recommend playing processor-intensive games or using apps that require extended computational power, but that is certainly not the intended market for this device. For general home or school use, it will work fine. If you are used to a more expensive laptop, you will recognize that ASUS has cut corners on the physical design to keep the price this low: somewhat flimsy-feeling monitor hinges, a trackpad that requires an almost heroic effort to click (can be set to respond to taps instead, of course). The screen is of decent quality, and the speakers, although rather tinny, are loud enough to get the job done. There is no CD/DVD drive on the model I received.  Considering its all-plastic case, I wouldn't expect many years' use out of the ASUS, but not subjecting it to too much transport would certainly help."}

The installation was very smooth -- the installer downloaded everything that was necessary and everything just worked on the first try.\n\nNow I have a small light laptop that runs linux.  It's easy to travel with and carry around.  I can stream video on a decent-sized screen (not a phone or tablet) while on the road.  It's a real computer with a hard drive (ie, not a chromebook) so I can run all the software I want on it, and use it when I'm offline for whatever reason.  It does not feel like it's very high quality -- so who knows how long it will last -- but for $250, who cares?  If it lasts me a year I'll feel like I got a good deal.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "I have been using this computer for about six months. It is very reasonably priced, (cheap), and works very reliably. The screen is good, and videos play quite well on them. The keyboard sucks. But then, I am used to my IBM Model M buckling spring keyboards, the best keyboards ever manufactured.  The feel of these keys, as I type this, is deplorable. But since people use Apple products, they are used to crap keyboards. What is good? Well, the hard drive is sizeable, although it comes pre formatted as a C and D drive, which I hate. No Windows disk is included for reinstalling my own preference of partitions. (None). The worst thing about this computer is that it comes with, yes, you know it, you hate it, Windows 8.  How on earth this piece of junk OS ever made it past the doors of Microsoft is beyond me. It is horrible. If, however, you know nothing about computers, you will never notice.  If you do, forget all about navigating around your system. It is not possible.\nThat's why I just bought a refurbished HP laptop from Woot. It comes with Windows 7, the best operating system on the planet, in my opinion.\nI will be migrating to that laptop when it arrives.  This one? Good for checking email, watching video, (NO DVD however!) I thought I would use an external one, and am, but that solution sucks big time. Takes up space and a USB slot.  Also, have to use a mouse, since the touch pad is notoriously lousy on this computer. I don't like touchpads anyway. That's about it. It is worth $250 but no more, And this keyboard! By the time I finished typing all this, I hate it even more."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "Initial Review After 2 Week Use 3/14/15 [Will Update with Full Review Later]\n\nI bought my laptop from Asus brand new on Amazon.\n\nIt gets the job done. I bought this for quick web browsing, light gaming, and college coursework. This was in my price range of $270. I did quite a lot of research and I knew this laptop was going to be fairly basic and if it became problematic it was only 200 or so dollars and I bought the extended warranty. I bought his laptop specifically because I needed the keyboard use, mouse use, and a laptop that was lightweight but could still handle helping me with homework. I have a desktop so I wasn't too heavily reliant on this laptop.\n\nInitial Concerns:\n1)  I have used a wireless mouse since I unboxed the laptop however the trackpad has stopped working and its only been a week so I don't see why the trackpad would stop working. I am very disappointed in the quality of this laptop's trackpad. I expected more from Asus.\n\n2) The screen will occasionally flicker back and forth from a blue hue to its standard colors. It doesn't really impair with any of my work and it happens very rarely so I choose to ignore it assuming its a glitch of some sort.\n\n3) My laptop did not come with a restore disk as my laptop does not have a cd/dvd drive. You have to use your own USB drive to download the System Restore information in case one day the worse happens and you need to restore your laptop. I bought a 16 GB flash drive not knowing how much I would need to use for the system restore. It used up 11 GB out of my entire flash drive. Once you create that Recovery Flash Drive you cannot use it for any other purpose so be sure to use one you won't need in the future.\n\n4) Using the Audio Input jack was frustrating because of RealTek, the audio program installed in the laptop. There was such a delay in recognizing earphones and sometimes the audio would just play out of the speakers even with the earphones plugged in. After uninstalling this I was able to use my earphones without any problems.\n\n5) Although this laptop has Microsoft Office on its main screen you do not get a full subscription of it to use on your laptop.. At best you get a free trial. This frustrated me but I should have done more research. I opted instead for installing LibreOffice, a free alternative to Microsoft Office.\n\n6) Its a very simple laptop so don't expect to run multiple intensive programs at once. It will stutter and pause if its handling too much at once. Just take it easy. And as for gaming it can handle Mass Effect 2 & 3 as well as Skyrim but be sure to only play for a short amount of time per session because you will burn out your laptop and remember that this is not intended as a gaming laptop so if you want your laptop to last a long time take it easy on the gaming.\n\nOverall, if this is in your price range and you like the weight and features but are still willing to put up with any of the initial things I listed above go for the purchase. Otherwise you may need to look into a higher grade laptop for a higher price. But sometimes you get what you pay for.\n\n I expected Asus to at least make a trackpad that works beyond a week and a screen that does not flicker. I had high hopes for Asus as I have heard nothing but good things about their company but now that I have my laptop I do have some warnings to tell my friends in the future.\n\nUpdate! 3/18/15\nI got my replacement laptop in very quickly. I've very pleased with Amazon's responsiveness to my replacement request. In terms of the new laptop I have not noticed the screen flickering and the trackpad works well. I was going to give this a week to see how things went but today is only the second day of owning this replacement laptop, which I have barely touched other than setting it up, and I notice that they spacebar is sticking. This did not happen with the first laptop they sent me but its still very disappointing in terms of quality. I want to make this laptop my main laptop for light travel and homework but first I need to get one that isn't defective. I've always praised Amazon for having wonderful customer service and I have heard great things about Asus laptops I just wish I could get a product that wasn't defective so I can review it properly. I'm going to try once more with Asus to get a working laptop without defects so hopefully the third times makes a difference. Its disappointing that I had to go through all of that customization just to find another defect in my brand new laptop. I will update if I try for a third time to get a replacement laptop.\nLast Edit: 4/3/15\nI did not try to get a third replacement. Quite honestly I just had a disappointing experience with this laptop's important defects like the trackpad or the keyboard. It wasn't worth the constant waiting for a replacement with the hope that maybe the new one would arrive and not be defective. Overall, I'd just say do your research and find a laptop in your price range. If possible get it from a store near you so that if you do need to return it then you can do it quickly and not have to wait so long. Overall, if I had gotten a laptop without defects I would have liked this laptop well enough but seeing as I didn't I'm going to stick with my current rating."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00SV72ZA2", "review": "UPDATED- SEE BELOW\nThe laptop itself is decent. It has a full size keyboard and I didn't have any trouble removing unwanted programs or adding new ones. The speed is decent and it was easy enough to connect to our home wifi network and printer. It feels sturdy, not premium which should be expected for the price. The problem, and the reason I am returning this laptop is that the mandatory Windows updates freeze the computer and don't allow it to restart. I've had to do a computer refresh/reset twice already and I've had this computer less than 2 weeks. At a minimum, it's inconvenient and if I hadn't set up all of my files to back up to my local network, it could have been worse. Maybe I got a bad egg. I'm going to try the same model again and I'll update the review with any changes.\n**********UPDATED****\n After getting a new model and meticulously installing each update separately as suggested by customer service I thought I was in the clear. After less than a month's use, the touch pad has become extremely finicky and doesn't work beyond the start-up screen, if that. I borrowed a wireless mouse from another computer to copy my files but I'm over this computer. It's possible I just had a streak of bad luck, but I've never had a laptop with this many issues so early on. This time I'll be switching brands and models."}

I've been using the laptop for about five hours, removing much of the unnecessary software that comes with all computers, and installing my favorite programs.  The problem is that it is suprisingly slow for a brand-new laptop, even in executing normal, low-demand tasks and operations.  And computers only get slower as you install more applications, fill up the hard drive, etc.  And perhaps I have not given the trackpad sufficient time to get used to it, but it *does* seem terribly clumsy.  I find myself clicking the right button instead of the left (since the whole trackpad is offset so far to the left) and it feels like some of my clicks are not even being registered.  I would not purchase this laptop if I had the choice again."}
