{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "I purchased the 8\" Samsung Galaxy Tab A from a different retailer last night as part of a promotion they are offering when trading in a used tablet. My previous tablet was a Nexus 7 2012 that had become almost unusable due to the Lollipop update. Screens were slow, reading a book became tedious because turning pages was too slow and a slew of other complaints too numerous to name. All of this was solved by the Galaxy Tab A.\n\nThis tablet is not perfect though. The screen resolution is a glaring con, especially coming from a higher end tablet like a Nexus 7. The XGA 1024x768 resolution is very lackluster when considering that most 8\" tablet are either 1280x800 or 1920x1200. This is why I can only give the tablet 4 stars instead of 5. When reading books the pixelation of the screen is noticeable, but not so bad as to make it unreadable. I imagine that in a few weeks I won't notice the pixelation as much as I do now. The good news is that this was my only con with the tablet.\n\nLeading the list of pros is the implementation of Lollipop on this tablet. The device turns on quickly, the menus are snappy, turning pages is quick with almost no loading and it ran Hearthstone smoothly (caveat: I only launched the game and went through the beginning menus, I didn't play a match). Coming from the crippled Nexus 7, I am more than pleased with how fast this tablet ran.\n\nIn the end, take this tablet for what it is, a low end budget tablet that runs Lollipop smoothly but has a less than desirable screen resolution. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is in the same situation as I was with an old Nexus 7."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "This is a very nice clean upgrade to the tablets. It runs Lollipop very very well and is fast. Bought my wife the older 10\" Samsung and this is faster, thinner, cheaper and better in all way. Although it seems amazingly thin it is still solid.\n\nIt has the faster new WiFi as well (AC rather than N or Dual-Band). I am getting about 100Mbps down and upload speeds with it while N will do about half that. My Chromebook will do 200 but this is just fine..\n\nThe one downside of this newer tablet is that the screen resolution is noticeable in not being so dense as other tablets. My Nexus10 is amazing how small the font can be set. With this only being 1024x768 the font is either clipped or has to be set larger with web pages. I believe the \"S\" model is much better but double the price. The Nexus10 is about 4x the resolution. The Nexus10 runs Lollipop well but not the Nexus7.\n\nI used this at a local free WiFi drop (Starbucks/Google) comparing it to the older tablets. It loads web pages almost instantly and had no issues streaming live TV and DVR recordings off my home network. No issues at all. This was about a 9Mbps connection. Much faster than Nexus7.\n\nIf you have been waiting to upgrade an old tablet (in my case a Nexus 7 that limped once given Lollipop to suck on) this is the time. Get one now!\n\nNote this is the 4:3 old TV format, so it is better for reading potentially. All around tablets are gaining in leaps and this is a big one."}

The problem is now more frequent, and out of warranty."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "Got my brand new Tab A 16 GB tablet, and let it load the same apps I had on my android phone. I don't have that many apps, but after the process was completed there was only 1 GB left in the internal memory. Most of the internal storage was occupied by the OS and various shoveware/bloatware that I was not able to remove. In light of this, assess carefully whether the 16 GB version will work with you. Yes, I know there is an expansion slot for a micro-SD card, but what you can put on it is limited. So I'd suggest that you carefully assess your long-term storage needs before going with the 16 GB version. I returned mine and got a 32 GB version. I'm still pretty unhappy with how limited the micro-SD card is, but at least I have 32 GB of internal storage now--so I'm a lot worse off than I would be otherwise."}

It dropped maybe 6 inches???? Thinking nothing could have possibly happened to it with such a small drop, she continues to turn it on so she can use it, and we find out that the screen no longer works.  It now has lines across half of the screen making it impossible to use.  It even had a case on it.  Its rediculous that this thing built to not even be able to withstand the slightest drop without being ruined.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "This tablet is a huge disappointment.\n\nFirst off, it is unreasonably slow. Samsung obviously went for battery life here, but what good is a long battery life if you can't stand to use it? It is sluggish and frequently non-responsive even with only two or three apps running. For a modern device in 2018 this sort of performance is unacceptable, even at this price point.\n\nSecond, the touch screen is terrible. It's randomly unresponsive, and seems to be poorly calibrated. I have great difficulty closing tabs in Chrome because it just won't believe that I am touching the little \"x\". Instead, I get lots of blank, new tabs and the top menu pulldown because it just won't register the touch point correctly. That makes web browsing a frustrating experience.\n\nThird, the display itself is mediocre. Colors are dull and the pixel grid is visible enough that it's distracting. This is not a device for viewing photos or watching videos.\n\nFourth, the auto-brightness is poorly calibrated. It is simply too bright unless you turn the manual adjuster way, way down, almost to the end. It feels like the sensitivity adjustment is non-linear. And, the brightness level it chooses never seems to be right. It's too dark in bright rooms, and too light at night. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.\n\nFor a budget tablet, it's OK, but for them money you can do better. Buy something else."}

If I unplugged it I would get the endless power up cycle or the full shut down. Mind you this was within the first few months of purchase.

The battery charges for 'bout 4 to 5 hours which isn't all that great but for this price and the quality you're getting i believe it's worth the buck.\nI'm very satisfied with the display. Very bright and pronoun colors. I was in a dilemma between this and the Tab E 9'6 but when i watched a comparison video i got infatuated. Put on something colorful on that lock screen and watch the magic.\nOnly negative i can say is that i received the wrong power brick. We don't use the same kind in most of Europe.\n\nP.S I forgot to mention that the sound speaker is in a pretty bad place. Like when you use the accelometer in racing games i keep blocking it with my hand. Not an issue if you put on a pair headphones though."}

The battery lasts a long time and recharges rapidly.  However I am transitioning from a Windows 10 based tablet and am new to the Android operating system.  I expected most things at the OS level to be different, but a computer is a computer and the underlying features should be more or less the same.  The Android documentation is simply awful.  In summary, the tablet is great and what I have been able to work out with Android has been successful without glitches or crashes, but if you don't already have Android experience think twice.  Five stars for the tablet, two stars for the operating system."}

This device has not been abused in the week I have had it - I have handled it very cautiously. Yet I placed it on a table the other night (the glass was not broken) and plugged it in to charge. When I woke up and grabbed it the next morning, there was a crack from corner to corner across the whole face. My wife and I are the only ones who live here, so there is no chance someone else abused it. So the thing cracked merely by me setting it on a table and plugging in a cable!

Time to charge was about as user manual explains - 4 hours to charge if fully discharged.  So, it took about 1 hour 35 minutes.  Easy to set up - not too many screens to go through and not difficult to figure out how to provide input to go on to next screens.  User manual misled me by its description of Microsoft Word being preloaded on the tablet.  After copying a Word document from a computer to this tablet, the document could not be opened - interface sought a network connection.  I thought that I would be able to at least view a Word document without a network connection.  Samsung customer service person informed me that at least for first use, tablet software will seek updates to Word, and therefore a network connection is needed.  After initial updates, I was informed that I should be able to work with Word documents without a network connection.  Found out 1/1/2018 that Ethernet network option is not available despite the user manual describing that it is.  Samsung customer service informed me that the Galaxy Tab A is not designed to work on an Ethernet network no matter what adapter is tried.  Internet search, that included discussions among tablet users did not find any assurances of tablet use with any Ethernet adapters.,"}

The external memory card works but you can't put most programs on it (they won't run from the external memory card) so it's not a viable solution for the space limitations.

After doing a bunch of comparisons, it came down to the Amazon Paperwhite, Kindle HD 8\", or the Samsung Tab A 8.0 (I really wanted the Samsung S2 or S3, but couldn't justify the cost). The Paperwhite screen was only 6\", which was too small for me. So, the Kindle vs Tab A. I finally decided that I didn't want to lock myself into the Amazon ecosystem, so I chose the Tab A.\n\nSo far, I'm loving it. Perfect size for reading (about the size of a hardback book, definitely bigger than a paperback). I downloaded the Netflix app. Yes, I prefer a bigger screen, but it's perfect for an occasional flight in a cramped seat. My MP3 files sound great, and all of my reading apps run flawlessly. The only wart is that the Tab A 8.0 only has one speaker, so the only way to get stereo sound is via external speakers or ear buds. No biggie, since I bought this for its portability.\n\nAll in all  I couldn't be happier."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "It's OK runs well so far, it's still new so time will tell as these products seem to deteriorate over time. It is somewhat fast thus far and handles all apps pretty well. One issue I am running to a lot is Apps in the google store give me the error 'may not be optimized for this device\" about 80% of the time. Seems rather odd. Supposed to be with Android 5 but was delivered with Android 6. Upon starting is immediately began an update and now it is running Android 7.1.1. Perhaps that might be the issue with the apps. it also is confused about the \"home page\" because ALL apps I install say it is \"adding short cut to the home page\" but actually it is adding it to the page just to the right of the home page, and YES, I know where my home page is. Screen is very clear and it reads books really well with ZERO pixelation. I am finding it is much easier to use it in landscape mode but I am constantly clicking back button and multiple page button over and over again. It's also very easy the click the apps on the bottom row by accident as well......I am for ever opening up the camera by accident. I hate the position of the rear camera...when in landscape and trying to take a picture my fingers always get in the way of the lense due to its poor placement. Si I have to hold it by the very edge so as not to block the lense and that makes it a bit difficult to hold it steady and secure. Pictures are OK for the price I paid but the camera does not do well in poor or low lighting. I also am finding that the touch screen is somewhat sporadic. Some times while online it takes multiple taps in order for it to register. I don't know how many camera shots I have lost due to the fact that it wasn't registering my taps on the button. My biggest downer about this thus far is the speaker placement. In portrait it is on the bottom left and in landscape it is on the bottom right, right where my hand is. Super poor placement IMO. Overall, for the price I paid for it I am somewhat happy but I just have to get used to the things I don't like about it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "Picked up this tablet recently when the price dipped one evening to about $130 for use as a FPV and telemetry display for flying my Solo quads.  I had been using my Samsung phone, but I wanted a bigger image to help compensate for slightly over 30 eyes.  The 8\" size is perfect, although a tad heavy and about the max that fits in the controller mount.  I had initially tried an older 8\" Lenovo tablet that I already had, but it was incompatible with the app I need to run.  The Tab A is one of the tablets tested to be fully compatible with the app, so I figured I'd just buy one, especially given the price, even though the technology is getting a little dated.  Interestingly, when I'm not out flying, I find myself using this tablet more and more for email, reading the news over coffee in the morning (not CNN or MSNBC fake news!), web searches, Amazon shopping, etc.  It's plenty fast enough for these purposes, the display is sufficiently bright and pleasant to look at, and the battery holds up well for many hours.  It also comes with very usable Microsoft Office apps, although I've so far only found the need to use Word or Excel a couple of times.  The only negative as a FPV display is that the image could be a tad brighter for outdoor use.  But with a sun shade or by standing under a tree to get out of the direct sun, it works pretty well to see where you're flying and to keep track of down-range distance, altitude, flight battery charge state, etc.  For the price paid, this is a really nice tablet in a size that's perfect for me.  Oh yeah, one nice surprise I wasn't expecting: shortly after I started using it, the operating system updated to Android 7!"}

I really like the 8.0\" form factor.\n\nWhat I really didn't like was that after being notified on 11/01/17 that an upgrade to the operating system was available, and after I had it installed overnight, the thing overheated on the morning of 11/02/17 to the point of not only melting the back but also the case (partially) ... and when I finally got it cooled down, well ... dead as a doornail. I was just streaming music at the time with the screen off and it was not plugged in. Not ready for 7.1.1? Don't  know, but I think that maybe I'll try a different one this time.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "This was a terrific tablet, until it forced me to do the recent software update, Nougat 7.0 I think. That has badly screwed up my tablet. It took almost a whole gigabyte of memory, it changed the icons and words under pics in the gallery to just icons that I cannot understand. It changed the font size, and I have trouble reading small print. When I try to change it back, it just says 'uploading' but never actually loads the screen, so I am still unable to change the font size or read anything. Videos now auto play instead of letting me select if I want to play them. The screens to each side of the main screen now load very slowly. After turning it on, it now takes over a minute to load when it used to go very fast. It changed the keyboard and rearranged the keys and I have no idea how to change it back, if I even can. It seems that all the update did was completely slow down my tablet and change all of the icons. No improvement. I am going to try and factory reset my tablet to get rid of the update. If that doesn't work I'll be getting rid of the tablet. Its not any good if I can't use it! It was a great tablet that was fun and easy to use. Now its just an expensive piece of junk"}

Touch screen is very dodgy (does not sense touches accurately either with finger or stylus). I absolutely HATE Android as an operating system for endless reasons; high among these is that all navigation is unique based on the particular hardware manufacturer and particular app. This means \"help\" facilities are nearly useless because they are hardware and configuration specific and rarely apply to the situation at hand. Samsung's manual assumes a familiarity with Android jargon and navigation which means no explanation starts at square one (or provides links for clarification). I will likely use this only for reading ebooks (quick response time is less of an issue) and when traveling (when packing needs to be light and use would be only minimal).\n\nThe only positives in my opinion are that it is very portable and easier to read than a smartphone."}

I did the factory reset and it improved a little bit but still not great. Told her, well if it continues to give you problems just take it to the Samsung authorized since product is still under warranty. Well, today she calls me saying she wants to take it but guess what I was told on a chat with a Samsung agent? They do not cover warranty internationally and if I want to schedule a service I have to ship it to USA (and yes I made sure to ask at Best Buy about international warranty and was told it is global) wonderful!

Next, Samsung told me I was 2-3 weeks past warranty so they couldn't do anything about but direct me to their help forum and offer to fix it for cost. They suggested battery replacement, which I bought, battery worked when installed but then wouldn't charge. Now, thinking it could be loose charging port. Such a ridiculous amount of problems for a product that only gets light use around the house. Used to love Samsung products, but finding lately quality to be lacking. I love idea of expandable storage but at this point, not worth it. I have almost spent as much in fixes as I did on tablet originally.

I was having a few issues before warranty, but thought it was nothing.  While in use, tablet will shut and sometimes it keeps rebooting over & over.  Usually just shut it off and wait awhile.  Also, battery can be fully charged, with very little use, shuts down, and then will show a lower battery level than it should.  Battery is sure being drained fast.  If this is the battery, shouldn't it last longer than barely a year."}

I started to use it again and if I stopped for any reason it would go black and I would have to hit the power button to get the screen again. I tired to work with it and just gave up. This morning (Tuesday) I went on line to chat with the Samsung Support. I installed the program that allowed the tech to access my tablet.\nHe checked it out and recommend I set it back to factory re stall. I did and then I could not even work to set it up again as it kept going black.\nThe Samsung tech said it was most likely a factory defect and I could take it to a Samsung repair shop to have it fixed for free. That is not acceptable for me to have to repair a brand new tablet. So I am sending it back. I am not sure if I will purchase another Samsung Tablet A\nor go with another brand.

The SD card recommended by Best Buy has never worked and neither has a couple others I used that were lying around from Android phones I used in the past. I haven't figured out if the problem are the cards, the tablet, or maybe operator error. Camera resolution needs to be upgraded from 5MP. 5MP, really?!?!?! A 5MP camera is no longer satisfactory in this day and age. I love the size and portability, but miss my similar sized iPad that had a far better camera to catch live performances during a four day festival. The difference in videos uploaded to our YouTube page is very significant. The OS is okay, but many apps run less than adequate compared to my former iPad. In fact, both Facebook apps are a joke and far too time consuming when attempting to interact with our fans on the fly. For the money, the Samsung Tab A is okay. But if money isn't a factor in your purchase or you're looking to use a tablet for professional video, go iPad. Apple is still the company that sets the bar."}

Being a senile old fart, I managed to leave it unwatched for a few minutes at the Chicago Amtrak station and it vanished a week ago. So, I replaced it with a Galaxy Tab A expecting the new OS to be at least as competent as the old one. I am incredibly disappointed.\n\n This thing is a toy device more designed for the cell phone crowd than for people who expect to accomplish some work on a tablet. If you want to play children's games, slowly browse the internet viewing the Kardasians' latest idiocy, or paw through the usual email crap one-at-a-time, this is the device and OS for you. The Android Office app is gone, the OS and the installed games and other garbage take up 2/3 or more of the 8G of onboard RAM so you probably won't be able to load many of the projects you might have worked on with earlier versions or devices. Many of the functions of the three \"buttons\" have been deranged so that they are less intuitive and less useful. The reliance on the often hidden four parallel lines \"setup\" tag is discouraging.\n\nI generally do not consider Apple products for much of anything work-wise, but I will be looking at that company for my next device."}

I actually really liked this tablet until 4 months ago.  It started to shut off and on once the battery gets below 35%. I thought It was crashing, but it restarts after a few tries and everything is back. Then it continues to turn off and on until recharged.  Today the battery said 87% when i opened it,  and within 5 minutes dropped to 35% and began it's shut off thing.  I assume it's a battery malfunction, but goodness it hasn't even been quite a year.

I love playing the game WORDS WITH FRIENDS.  I was playing through my computer, through FACEBOOK.  The game moved so slowly, pop-up commercials were a constant, the board would freeze, and all of this would cut into my game production time.  Plus, it was very frustrating to sit and wait while a letter slowly went from the bottom of the board to where I wanted to place it!  And, really, I have ZERO patience!\n\nMy husband got me this SAMSUNG tablet and I could not be happier with it.  I am able to be on FACEBOOK, play WORDS WITH FRIENDS, check my email, play other games, plus there are many other features that I have yet to dive into.  The tablet fits nicely in my hands.  It also comes with a stylus. There is also a charger included  The tablet charges quickly and holds the charge for my entire day.  We purchased a screen protector and cover separately for my tablet.  It is sleek and cool and wonderful.\n\nI am a technology challenged person, but seem to be able to muddle through this tablet and its many functions nicely.

It lasted a few days and is now having the same issue as the first with the endless restarting loop.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "Why is it that all of my Android phones are fantastic but no one can seem to build a great Android tablet?\n\nI found this tablet to be a bit on the slow side.  I also found the touchscreen frustrating.  It simply would not read the user's \"clicks\" unless you held your finger down on a link/button for a long period of time; in a web browser this would bring up the context menu because you pressed for so long.\n\nThis tablet does NOT have a magnetometer or accelerometer so you can forget about any compass based apps ever working.\n\nThe 16GB fills quickly with just a few of your apps, Samsung spam apps, and other bloatware that you cannot move to an external SD card.  Even the few apps that can be moved to the SD card will jump back to internal storage as soon as an update is pushed from the vendor.  This will happen about once per week on average.  Yes, Android 6.0 Marshmallow permits running apps of the SD card (aka Adoptable Storage) but Samsung has disabled this feature.  They want to force you to buy a 32GB or 64GB model.\n\nI lost patience with it after a couple of weeks.  Maybe someone else will be happy to buy it as a refurb."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "This is  a great little tablet. Heavy little sucker for its size, almost as heavy as my Galaxy Tab S 10.5.  The Costco unit came with Android 6.01 pre-installed, which is a big plus over having to upgrade from version 5. The Tab A 7.0 is stuck on Android 5 and only has 8gb. Got the SS blue Canvas book cover and it's the compete package. I bought it primarily for Kindle reading, but the screen is surprisingly good for web, email, video and other apps. Connected to my 5g network no problem. Battery life is very good. Performance is pretty good, minimal lag. OS is good, SS software is pretty good as well. I don't mess with a SS account or offers, so I downloaded the standard Kindle for Android. Haven't messed with the included MS Office apps, so I can't rate them. Considered the iPad Mini, but I prefer the more open android system. Tablets and Phones are expensive, but this is a much better deal than either an iPad Mini or the Tab S2 8.0. The S2 is lighter and faster and has an amoled screen, but for what I'm using it for it's a waste of money. I give it an initial thumbs up, and I've had good luck with SS products. Interestingly, this is the first SS phone or tablet I've had that didn't have lit navigation buttons. No matter, I know where they are, and it saves battery life."}

The most frustrating, wkrst tablet I have ever seen. I have used tablets and computers for years and am very savy, however My MAIN criticism is an issue with the touch screen, which is WAY over-responsive. No place to  to hold it without changing something. There is virtually no border around the screen, so, even with the clip on case, you have to be able to grip the tablet somehow to hold it up because some apps only display one way, and you cannot always lay the tablet on a flat surface and use every game or app that way. The screen is upside down when reading and though clear,, the heartache of trying to personalize the thing is not worth your time or money. There is no clear option to even personalize your internet home screen, and Samsung left out numerous options from this tablet."}

It is a nice budget tablet but I will be setting it aside and going back to my larger device.  The pros for me are that it is light and easy to hold in my hand.  I like the Android system of creating folders for apps to remove desktop clutter. The things that I dislike on this device are the placement of the switches, the on/off and the toggle for the volume are next to each other and it's too easy to choose the wrong button.  The screen resolution isn't the greatest, especially when reading and it's too slow to multi-task.  The app store lacks a lot of the things that are in the Apple store, I was especially disappointed that the Weather Channel app didn't work.  I couldn't play several of my favorite games because they wanted too much personal information or I had ads in my face all the time. People have said how long it lasts between charges but that has not been my experience.  The build quality on this tablet is decent except for the plastic case, but the keyboard is frustrating to use.  It was good to compare and I will probably use this tablet sometimes but for me Apple products are still better, in essence you pay for what you get."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "About a year ago I bought a Samsung Galaxy 7 tablet for my son as a Christmas gift, but never had a lot of interest in buying one for myself, seeing I owned a Kindle Fire.  Even though he is disabled, my son loves his tablet and takes it most everywhere with him.  I have a Samsung Galaxy 5 cell phone, but it is a work phone and I am not allowed to load apps or anything to it.  Love the phone but not being able to do anything non-work related with it is frustrating.  So between my son's tablet and my phone, I have always been impressed with Samsung mobile type products.  A friend has a Samsung tablet and suggested I might find it easier to use and more beneficial than my Kindle.  I had always found the Kindle to be difficult to use except as a reader and for audible books and I have had it for several years now.  So I figured I would give a tablet a try and this Samsung seemed to fit the bill.  I am very impressed with it and now do everything I use to do with the Kindle plus a lot more.  Accessing email, using apps, shopping on Amazon, plus syncing it with my Kindle and Audible books, is a lot better than my Kindle.  So the Kindle will gather dust or I will give it to a friend.  BTW - I don't get the cheap looking comments on this tablet.  Not so in my opinion and I have a nice case for it, so not sure what folks are referring to in that regard.  Very nice tablet for this first time tablet owner."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "First, this thing is so slippery I had to cover it with masking tape just to keep it from slipping around like a slimy fish. And where ever the screen is touched, some function turns on or off.  Trying to read a book on it is almost impossible unless you are comatose and can't move or breathe. You find your place and when you touch the device to set it down somewhere, it suddenly magnifies/decreases the page, turns on or off, goes ahead/behind to another chapter/page. Pick it up to correct it and it slips through your fingers like a wet fish.  After you have climbed out of bed to catch it again and find your place, and maybe even set the timer, then you have to place the weanie speakers right up to your ears because if you are the kind of person who likes to breathe, you won't be able to hear it because the volume is on the back of the unitand is very very weak.  So you can't see what you're doing plus HEAR anything at the same time.  Forget about listening to this thing in the car on the way to your knitting class.  Also, every time you turn on the wi fi to say, download a book, prepare to wait about 15 minutes and to lose about 98% of your battery before you can actually use it again.  When all updates are finally finished you only have 2% battery and have to recharge before listening to your audio book or checking your email. In the middle of doing anything it freezes up because suddenly you have 17 mysterious gigabytes trying to run at one time.  It is nothing at all like the more substantial Tab 2.  Its a fail :("}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "Got this tablet as a Christmas gift.  Have had iPads & phones for a number of years so hard to rate an android like I do apple.  I do like the tablet and can do pretty much what our apples do.  The main thing I may be unhappy with is not being able to move some of the apps to the SD card.  I don't go app crazy so I only have a few apps but I'm disappointed that some won't move to the external SD card and it seems like the 16 GB memory is filling up fast.  Haven't checked user guide to see if there are more options to free up space once the internal storage is full but could be I can uninstall a lot of pre-loaded apps that I won't use. Galaxy has a great reputation and I do like the chance to learn about android since my wife has an android tablet.  Because it's not like iOS it takes a while to accomplish what we want but so far have muddled my way through things.  I have also heard because android is a user based OS that it is easier to hack. Also read that sometimes moving apps or some things from 1 android OS to another may not work.  The tablet seems to run slower than apples and at times it seems like it locks up.  I'm  sure if you're an android fan the tablet would rate 5 stars.  I gave it 4 because the cost of the android is more reasonable than apple.  Hope this is helpful."}

The design is sleek, thin, and the smoky titanium is aesthetically pleasing. I know I can take this with me anywhere, and the battery life is solid. So far I've been able to get two days of use on a single charge.\n\nPerformance wise, this tablet is very fast and responsive. It's basically a bigger version of my galaxy phone, which I love. The storage space is a little small, but thankfully there's an sd slot to make up for that. The only weird thing I've run into is it had me go through 3 or 4 software updates when I first got it, so it could upgrade to the latest version of android. For me this wasn't a problem, just a little annoying to deal with upon first using it. For the price this is a very high quality product, and I would recommend it to anyone!\n\nPros: lightweight, beautiful display, very responsive touchscreen, good battery life, google apps, sleek look, fast performance\nCons: small storage space of only 16gb"}

If this happens, I would have to hold down on the power and the volume keys for about ten seconds and it would work again.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "I have been an Apple iPad purist for years. When I recently gave my mother my iPad Mini (she is having some issues with her vision and it's easier for her to use for certain apps than her phone), I thought I'd be content with just having my Pro 9.7. However, I like to read in bed, and the larger iPad really doesn't work well for that. I considered a Kindle Paperwhite, but since the Paperwhite doesn't reverse to a black field with white text I didn't want to use that and needed something for which I could use the Kindle app.\n\nI decided to try an Android tablet, which would be significantly less expensive than a new Mini 4. Plus, I'd been wanting to get experience with Android because I have friends who have Android phones who are always asking me questions about them for which I have no answer. After doing a bit of research, I decided on the Galaxy Tab A 8-inch, which was almost exactly the same size as the Mini. Several local stores had good sales but nobody ... and I mean NOBODY ... had one in stock. They had plenty of the 7\" tablets but with the smaller size and only 8GB of memory, even with the SD expansion slot, I wasn't interested. So I ordered it here.\n\nI am very pleased with this device. It was easy to set up and it's been responsive and intuitive to use. The size and form factor are nearly identical to my old Mini. If anything I like the Kindle app better on the Android than on the iPad -- not the least of which is because you can buy Kindle books directly from the Android app and not from the Apple one (has to do with Apple demanding 30% of all sales on the iPad, which includes Kindle books. Can't say I blame Amazon for not wanting part of that \"deal\").\n\nI only have one minor complaint and not a large enough one to warrant a loss of a star -- you can't turn down the ambient light on the Galaxy as far as you can with the Mini. This only becomes an issue because I tend to stay up later than my husband so when I am reading he is trying to sleep, and it seems like I can't get the screen as dark as my Mini could go. Curiously, he says the ambient light it throws seems to be less overall and it doesn't bother him at all. Maybe it projects less overall but it seems brighter to me."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "I have owned the Samsung Galaxy Tab A for a year now. I primarily bought if for my son. However, I discovered early on there is a significant flaw for parents who are concerned about controlling the content their teens/tweens have access to. ALL Samsung tablets have a feature that allows multiple user accounts - one primary account (administrator), and other designated users, restricted users and/or guest user accounts. This could be a really nice feature if the creation of accounts was secured and restricted to the device owner/administrator. That is not the case, however. Even if the primary account is locked with a password, anyone who picks up the tablet and uses the settings pull-down menu on the locked tablet can create a guest user account. This means my teenager can create a temporary guest account, search for anything and everything on the internet (because parent controls established on the primary account or other user accounts don't apply to each new guest account)...and then erase that account and its history. The internet is riddled with parents bemoaning this 'feature' and there is not fix for it without the risk of rooting your device.\n\nSO if you are looking for a tablet for your teen/tween and you plan to establish parent controls, you will want to look at other brands. I personally decided on an Asus Zenpad as I wanted to stay with the Android operating system.\n\nIF you don't have kids, and this is a tablet for your own personal use, then it should be fine. It is user friendly, a nice display, and identical to other Samsung phone products so the learning curve is minimal if you also own a Samsung phone.\n\nAll that said, I won't personally recommend it, or any other Samsung tablet, for that matter, as I think it is absolutely unconscionable that Samsung has not made the multi-user feature one that can be turned on or off by the device administrator based on their need."}

Because that is in essence, what you are doing when you buy this product! Don't be naive like me, and think that just because it's a mid range tablet,  that it will last very long. If you want to have to replace it in less than a year, you may as well save a hundred dollars and buy a cheaper tablet with better screen resolution. I bought this tablet just 8 months ago. A week ago, it started flashing the blue screen,  just for a second while watching netflix. And a few days ago, it started turning the volume down on it's own. Which makes it impossible to listen to music,  watch videos/movies. And when it starts doing it, the volume tab will drop down/dissappear/drop down again,  repeatedly. Making even playing simple games impossible. AND when restarting the tablet a few minutes ago, it started itself in safe mode. Which disables most apps. I thought for a moment that I wasn't going to be able to get it off of safe mode. Because it says restart now to disable safe mode, but yet, it just restarts itself in safe mode. Had to shut down the power and then turn it back on, rather than restarting. Smh. I am incredibly disappointed."}

I've used this device to write essays, assemble power point presentations, and even used one note as scratch paper while doing algebra.  Its small, but not too small. Its powerful and reliable.  Its not as beefy as some of the other galaxy tabs, but you really get a good machine in a small package. It can even run pokemon go (if you have a phone with wifi hotspot with you as well). This device has given me an edge as a student due to its capabilities in relation to its size. It does everything a tablet should do.

There is apparently no way to get them back and no app that I have found will replicate what it used to do.\n\nAlso,  there is no way to set a new app as a default for anything.  I cleared the default for the stock email app,  then installed boxer.  When I got a notification for a new email,  it just opened the stock app,  even though in the app manager,  it says no default selected.  There is no way to select boxer as the default.  Boxer does not even show uo in the list of apps to choose from for default apps.

If it is possible,  the manufacturer has certainly made it difficult to discover how to do it."}

I was a little disappointed because it does not have the Samsung Theme Store but its not a big issue.\nGood for kids or people who just want a tablet to watch videos and do light gaming."}

There is no reason any application should exceed 200MB of size unless it is a video game.\n\nAudiophiles might want to stear clear of this tablet with its single speaker.\n\nThis device had so much potential as an economy tablet.

It's starting to get very slow, and it feels so heavy. :) So I went tablet shopping.\n\n The screen on the Asus is 4.25\" wide. This Galaxy tab A is 4 7/8\" wide. I had no idea what a difference that would make. It feels like I'm looking at the page of a hardback book. That's about the size of the screen.\n\nThis tablet weighs less than 8 ounces. My Asus is 15 ounces. Again, a huge difference in comfort. The Asus is not as customizable because of the Android 4.2.2 OS. This galaxy is 6.0. Larger fonts! Yay!\n\nThe screen feels like it is oiled. Absolutely no drag, and it responds instantly. No lag. Now, this IS a slippery tablet. I'm ordering a silicone skin for it. The tablet is thin, too.\n\nThe sound is fine! Quite loud enough without earbuds. The sleep button clicks easily with a satisyingly solid feel.\n\nI'll update as I learn more about it.

I added a 64GB microSD card, and told Google Play to load all movies on the card (AWESOME!!!! Saves soooo much space). I've also got VUDU installed doing the same... in total, I've added about 10 HD movies to his tablet all without taking up space from the precious 16GB RAM. [if you're wondering, the movies from Google Play are mainly Disney Movies Anywhere digital copies, and VUDU has the remaining UltraViolet digital copies).  All of them look fantastic on his tab (really, the relatively low screen resolution is NOT a problem whatsoever, for him and for most adults).

The fact that there's pre-installed MS apps:  If you need them, great.  If like me you don't need them?  You can force stop/disable, but there is no way to uninstall them.  that means there's apps taking up a lot of room when added together.  Have just a few apps I d/l, nothing fancy or super huge.  But since you can't move apps, etc. to an SD card (bought with - don't even know if it works!) you're looking at using up a good chunk of the 16Gb this tablet comes with.\n\nScreen is nice and clear, easy to hold, fast enough.  The camera (I know, tablet cameras usually aren't super) is terrible imho and I'm talking about the back camera.  Also do not like where the back camera is.  It's just not serving the purpose I bought it for at all.  Very disappointed with Samsung and this tablet.  I don't buy things often and when I do, I don't buy something to be completely frustrated by it.

My perspective is formed in comparison with my wife's S2 9.7 inch - which is an iPad equivalent (but a lot cheaper).\nMy concern for the 8 inch was a lesser resolution and a processor that clocks slower. Fear not. This is a really fine screen. The smaller size offsets the resolution specs. As to speed...this guy screams along with several windows or tabs open. Admittedly, my use is pretty pedestrian.\nI am not a gamer and I don't use it for productivity. But I could! I paired it with a Logitech blue tooth keyboard and checked out the pre-loaded Office suite. For travel purposes, this rivals a Surface in that respect. I added an SD card to expand memory - it accesses it automatically.\nMy other major use for this tablet is reading - I use Nook and Kindle apps. The screen can be dimmed in a manner to replicate a dedicated reader - eliminates that harsh blue light when reading at night.\nWhat's not to like?\nI picked this up at Staples for $129.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "Just bought the 8\" version of this product yesterday.\n\nI realize it isn't anywhere near a top-of-line tablet, but the main problem here is a mere 16gb of internal memory, and I'll explain why.\n\nAlthough it's advertised as delivered loaded with Android 5.0 (Lollipop), mine immediately upgraded itself to 6.0.1 (Marshmallow). Since so many people are anxiously waiting for OTA updates to Marshmallow on various devices, sounds great, right? Wrong.\n\nAlthough you can insert up to a 128gb card into the SD slot, in all their wisdom, Samsung decided to TOTALLY REMOVE \"adoptable\" SD card support from its version of Marshmallow. That is an Android standard for 6.0.1 (and even earlier releases), in which you have the option of configuring the SD card as an extension to internal storage, and the OS then treats it all as one big chunk of memory. Because of this, in a nutshell instead of winding up with 144gb of system memory, I'm stuck with 16gb.\n\nI really think the addition of this awesome Android OS feature is why you see so many tablets with only 16gb of internal memory nowadays. Now, on Samsung devices running Marshmallow, this feature is simply GONE with no explanation at all. I may as well be using a 4-year-old Nexus 7, as far as the amount of usable memory in this thing goes.\n\nAfter I discovered this mess, I was forced to use the only option that was left available to me, that being to move every app I could over to the SD card. That's a tedious process, having to go through all of your apps one-by-one (in my case, 50+ of them) using Application Manager to see if they can be moved. In the end, no help there either, because I found that about 90% wouldn't allow me to move them. After moving everything I could, a lot of the apps I moved refused to run for various reasons. Then of course, there's all of the bloatware that Samsung delivers along with its version of Android (that next to no one ever uses). None of that can be moved or uninstalled, chewing up yet more internal memory for absolutely nothing as far as I'm concerned.\n\nSure, you can use the SD card for storing files like pictures, music and the like. But for the life of me, I just can't understand why such a powerful option as adoptable SD card support was completely removed from Samsung's version of Android. It's unbelievable, and has a lot of people around the Web mighty ticked off. I posted in Samsung's tablet forum asking why they did this, and so far haven't received a single response. I'm guessing the Samsung people who monitor those forums don't have a clue as to what this feature even is, or they're simply not willing to talk about it.\n\nAs for the rest of the tablet, considering the price, it's okay. The weakest point in that department is the display, as it's only 1024x768 (720P). Because of that, some things look very pixelated. The rest of the tablet is nothing special, pretty standard stuff you'd find on any Android device.\n\nBottom line, if you think 16gb (more like 11gb after what the system and bloatware uses) is enough to hold all of your apps, go ahead and buy it. It sure isn't enough memory for me. If they put at least 32gb into it, I think the absence of adoptable SD card memory support would have been a bit easier to swallow."}

I watch Youtubes at night, read books at night, surf the web at nigh, I use it when the wife is asleep and I don't want to wake her. I have a powerful desktop that I use for my photography business, and I have a chromebook for general laptop use...love my chromebook. Back to the tablet. Our local wholesale club had this tablet on a one day sale on a price to good to pass up...how propitious.\n\nAfter charging it up it was time to compare it to my Nexus 7 2013 which is the only tablet I have used extensively. The screen....very nice I was quite impressed with the screen. It's not ultra HD...but certainly good enough to watch movies. The OS was fine. Setup was easy if you are familiar with Samsung..my phone is a Samsung. EVERYTHING lived up to my expectations except the audio. The audio was definitely better on the Nexus.\nThe extra one inch of screen real estate is wonderful, who woulda thought?  Is it a little long in the tooth? Yeah, a little. Does it do the job...absolutely.  Do I recommend it? Yes...at the price I paid, I could do not better. Samsung makes good stuff...well most of it that doesn't explode is great.\nAs I've said before, I only review products I am very happy with or extremely disappointed with.... I'm a pretty happy guy with this tablet."}

And it's extremely easy to find different cases for this tablet, i found on amazon for around $15. The internal storage is on the smaller side, however this is easily fixed with an external memory card. The camera isn't the highest quality but it works just fine; video shoots in 720p.

We originally bought a kids Amazon fire and that was a huge disappointment. I didn't want to pay the amount of money they asked for an iPad so I asked multiple people and did tons of research and everything pointed to this tablet!\n\nIt took me a little while to figure out since I have never owned any Samsung products, but I'm talking 10 minutes at most. It's still set up very similarly to Apple products.\n\nThis tablet runs great, super fast, which was the main problem with the fire. This one also offers everything I was looking for.\nMost parents want the \"kids time\" stuff with apps for their kids, which I believe there is an app for that on here, but I didn't. I wanted to download netflix, kids YouTube, learning apps, Disney jr, etc. That way my son could choose between what he wanted to do easily. The apps that came on here like chrome and mail and such I just moved 4 pages over and he has no idea they are there! I have my apps over there also ;)\nThe other great thing about this tablet is the battery life! It doesn't take long to charge and the battery actually lasts!\n\nI'm extremely impressed with this tablet, it is definitely worth the money!\nI 100% recommend this for a child or adult!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "I'm writing this review because I'm confused about all of the negative reviews I read about the screen resolution on the Tab.  I'm 75 years old and wear bifocals, so if there was someone to complain about the resolution I would be the perfect candidate.  As it is, I can read all of the text on internet sites and emails, and I can watch videos and movies on the Tab without any problem.  Regarding screen resolution, there was a time when no TV programs were in hi definition and yet thousands of people watched thousands of hours of TV without complaining about how lousy the resolution was.  Now, If you watch a program in regular mode and then switch to the hi def mode will the picture look better?  Of course it will, but it's relative.  I think a good challenge would be to line up a bunch of tablets, all with different resolutions, and then have people identify the exact resolution of each one.  Actually, if you go to any store that has 20 or 30 TV's on the wall all showing the same program, how many people would be able to identify the one with the best resolution?  If you can, congratulations.  Finally, if you're shopping for a tablet and go to a store that has them on display why would you buy one that you thought had poor resolution?  Furthermore, if you thought the resolution was bad and bought it anyhow why would you then complain about it in your review?  The same question applies even if you didn't have an opportunity to see it in person but just read numerous reviews about how bad the resolution was. I personally have absolutely no issue with the screen resolution on the Tab."}

They are the perfect size (a child doesn't need a huge display, but 8\" is still pretty big!), a perfect balance of features, and run very well everything they do and play on them. The 16 GB internal flash drive is more than enough for dozens of games they keep stuff in their device, and even better - I could add another SD card (I added 32 GB) for storing things like photos and movies and leave the 16 GB just for apps. A welcome surprise is that unlike many other devices, this one supports out of the box dozens of languages (including the one I cared about, Hebrew).\nI really recommend getting with this tablet also this cover, which protects the tablet from all directions (including the screen), and makes it easy to turn the table on and off just by flipping the cover:\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Fintie-Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-A-8-0-Smart-Shell-Case-Ultra-Slim-Lightweight-Stand-Cover-with-Auto-Sleep-Wake-Feature-for-Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-A-8-Inch-Tablet-SM-T350-Skyblue/dp/B00WM56A0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fintie Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8.0 Smart Shell Case - Ultra Slim Lightweight Stand Cover with Auto Sleep/Wake Feature for Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8-Inch Tablet SM-T350, Skyblue</a>"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "After returning two other tablets (Asus & Lenova), I settled on the Samsung Tab A 8\" tablet.  It has a great look and feel and had the features I wanted.  The glass is very tough and resilient, and it's very light and thin. Not having a smart phone and wanting to avoid data charges, I wanted a WiFi Tablet that would let me download apps, watch videos and share pictures and music.  I use my Samsung as a convenient way to watch Netflix videos and the picture quality is very crisp and clear.  Several weeks ago, I was taking a picture and fumbled while holding it.  It flipped out of my hands and over fence hitting the pavement causing the tablet to pop out of it's protective case.  What a Fluke!  It bounced right into a pond at a Water Lilly Park which was in a cement pool.  The tablet was way out of reach and settled down into a bed of slimy moss.  We were sure it was ruined and my heart sank right along with the tablet.  It was after hours and so we could not call park officials for help.  Over two hours later after dinner and before leaving town, I had a bad feeling about leaving it in waters so I bought a rake and we returned to the pond.  By then it was barely visible as green moss had settled over most of my tablet.  We took the rake was finally able to reach and drag it to the edge and up the side of the cement pond.  I put it in a bag of rice and we went home.  Monday at noon, I took it to a friend's shop who decided to help me out.  He fixes cell phone and had the tools to open it though he warned me that it was likely ruined. We hoped to get some level of power to get to the hard drive.  I got a call and was told he was able to get it to power up after cleaning it up.  I was shocked to find that the picture and video was still pretty darned good.  I could see some light water spotting on the screen, particularly on white background.  I was amazed at the quality of the video and the sound still worked the same! You would never guess that it was dragged through moss and against cement by a rake because there was hardly a scratch on the glass screen (just one very light scratch not too noticeable).  Several weeks have passed and it looks pretty good!  I can play games, surf the internet and the camera still works.  I will eventually replace it but still as good function and I use it daily with no big issues. Yes it has one speaker but the sound is fine for most things, and if I want better quality while watching a movie, I just use my small portable Blue Tooth speakers.  This may not be the top rated tablet but I can't afford those pricey tablets and this one serves my needs very well.  I love using my Samsung Tablet and I would buy this again with no hesitation. It's one tough little Tablet!"}

It was a little bulky for him with the foam kiddie case and our iPad was dying so we kept it for ourselves and just got him the 8 inch tab a. We love this tablet! Fairly easy to use, perfect for checking email, Internet and watching movies. I love that you can use an SD card for additional storage. Both Amazon video and Google play allow you to download movies and shows to the sd card for offline viewing. We take long road trips a few times a year and the 9.7 worked out so well for our last one, I know the 8 inch will be even better due to the size being easier for him to handle. If you are looking for a good tablet for watching shows, using basic apps and games, and Internet...this is it!"}

I really loved this tablet when I first got it but not long after using if for simple things like watching YouTube videos and listening to music, if started to randomly reboot.  Sometimes it would get stuck in a boot loop. Where the Samsung logo would show up and then restart over and over until I plugged in the charger. The battery would be over 50% and the problem would occur . It's sad because this reboot would occur when I was in the middle of playing games, especially and all my previous data would be lost. I searched all corners of the Internet for sale solution and I sadly did not find one. I tried multiple things and the problem still persisted. This is the second Samsung tablet I have bought within this year. The first one's Bluetooth and WiFi randomly stopped working, they wouldn't switch on.  It's practically useless... and now this one is defective. Samsung should really focus on resolving issues with their older products...I am very displeased. I will not be purchasing another Samsung tablet."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "Purchased this tablet in June 2016 in August it started having problems in.  Model SM-T350NZAAXAR.  It would shut down in the middle of use and go into an endless reboot loop.  Battery would show 100% and after 10 minutes of usage \"Low Battery\" would pop up.  Charging from Low Battery to 100% would take 5 minutes.  Clearly there are issues.  The tablet was in a case and with a tempered glass screen protector from day 1.\n\nTried restoring the tablet through Settings, it didn't help.  Tried restoring by holding Power and Volume Up, that didn't help either.  Used my Sony Xperia Z3 phone to open service ticket on samsung.com, but their site is not set up for mobile Chrome.  Requested Desktop version of the page, it would not load.  Had to use my laptop, which I almost never use.\n\nI always look for other options before I consider Samsung products.  The problem is many other manufacturers make even worse crap than Samsung does.  With this tablet, at first I purchased Lenovo Tab2 8\" but it would not stay connected to WiFi, I exchanged for an Acer 8\" tablet, but its speaker did not work, I exchanged for Samsung Tab A which worked fine for the whole TWO MONTHS.\n\nI have never had a good experience with Samsung.  20 years ago I purchased a Samsung 27\" CRT TV which whistled before electronics inside warmed up.  I exchanged that for a 27\" Sony TV and used it for many many years and threw it away only because of the move to flat TVs.  I was lucky enough to stay away from Samsung branded items for a long time (even though I am sure there were Samsung components in other devices I bought).  Then, a few years ago, I bought Samsung Galaxy S2 phone thinking that a couple of decades allowed Samsung to enhance quality of their products.  Not so.  The phone was great at first but then the power switch broke which caused the phone to reboot and turn on/off randomly.  I should have stuck with my No Samsung policy."}

The price was good so no complaints. I would recommend this tablet. The only problem I have with it is that it sometimes ahngs during a game.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "Works great! for about a 100$ it does what I needed it to and is the perfect size to fit in my purse. So far Ive owned 3/4 different tablets: a small \"phablet\", this one (8\"), a 10\" nexus, and the surface pro 4. Of the 4 tablets, I like this size the best.  The phablet I found was too big and awkward to comfortably fit in my pockets, but small enough that reading books or watching tv was a bit uncomfortable on the eyes.  By contrast the 10\" nexus and surface pro 4 (which I use for work primarily) are to large to fit in my mid size purses.  This size can fit in nearly every one of my bags ( the only exception being my small clutches and evening bags).\n\n It works quickly, and I haven't had any issues with it overheating. It is a bit of a slow charger, and if your are using the tablet with the screen on full brightness, it will drain the battery faster then it will charge. I did find however, that so long as you have the brightness set to the lowest level, it will (slowly) charge at a rate of about 1% increase per 10 minutes.  In normal conditions, if I am not charging and using simultaneously, it takes a couple hours to fully charge.\n\nThe blue smoke color is beautiful.  I bought a cheap (like 6$) case for my tablet to protect since it does get tossed about in my purse."}

I'm constantly bumping the screen or causing the screen to pop a series choices I don't want, I can barely get through an article I want to read. Play You-tube videos is frustrating since I inevitable hit a different video half way through and there's no back button on the terrible YouTube app. On the positive side  the screen is very nice with great detail it is useful for reading emails and responding. In general I still think Android is the problem, it still feels like a cheap imitation to IOS, I don't like the behavior of the home screen or how I have to select apps, I don't like having to root the device to get rid of Chrome which I neither need or want and considering the space used by native pre-installed apps I was hoping that I'd have more control with Android. I originally bought the device to read magazines, and this it does very well using Google News stand app. Would I recommend this device, no save you money and get an iPad like I will end up doing or just get a cheap Android tablet, Android isn't worth spending a lot of money on. I was really hopeful that I'd love this device, I'd seen it in person and I'd liked the hardware, but I see I will just sell it and by an iPad."}

I seldom watch videos on a tablet so that was also a factor in selecting the 4:3 format and the lower resolution of the Tab A vs the higher end Samsung tablets. The touch screen has a nice feel and is very responsive. I also like the magnetic sensor that places the tablet in sleep mode when using a case that has this feature. I have used 7 inch tablets and find them too small. Trying 10 inch tablets in stores I have found them to be a bit cumbersome and heavy for casual use and travel. The 8 inch size of this tablet is perfect for our use. It is near us at all times for quick Web browsing and reading email. The tablet comes with Microsoft Office, but I rarely use it on the tablet. I find that these programs are much better on a desktop or laptop computer.

On this there is double the bloatware of what my device came with, because not only are there useless Samsung apps I'll never use, but then useless Google apps For The Same Purposes as well! Although in some cases there is only one, it is usually google controlled! I don't approve of that because even opening a google app it has to ask for your permission for it to have your location so it can record anonymous data around everything you are doing, and functions will not work unless the device is attached to location which I frankly think is ridiculous because it is not necessary to the basic function of the app, it's just for google's benefit.\nThis tablet is so new there is no help for problems such as this, the entire purpose for which I bought this tablet is for reading school works, doing light research, and being able to begin typing papers when I do not have access to a computer. What has come out is that in some way even downloading a pdf using google chrome as your browser affects whether or not the device will be saved to your tablet; because in the last few days I have two files that \"completed download\" but an error message came up saying they did not complete upload to drive, and therefore disappeared. If something is stored on my device it should be solely in the hands of my device not an external application, it makes no sense. And for my other files that did finish I'm going to have to see if there is another pdf viewer, because with drive if you move the page everything has to reload which is ridiculous, I shifted the zoom, all the text was loaded. So I can't search the web, and I can't read, luckily the screen is responsive so I can type, but that doesn't seem good enough to me.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with this device seems to be the one thing I can find no article, help question, forum topic dedicated to, and I cannot find out the name; it is the application of google search from the Home Button. I believed it was called Google Tap but I can't be sure now, what I know for certain is it is the most annoying thing on this device. If a breeze even touches the home button it will believe you have held it down, and even if you don't drag out the word Google signalling you want to open that page, it will open for you because Google knows what you wanted. I have found nothing in the settings to turn off this function which is really frustrating, I'm trying to figure out a new device but I have no control over one button that is integral to using the device. I'm going to see if there's anything I can do about this but if there is not I will have to return this tablet."}

Our 51 inch plasma TV, 3x current S4 phones in use, Note 3 phone in use, S3 phone for years, Galaxy Tab 2 for years and I've had ZERO problems with All of these. Maybe I'm lucky but I am a big fan of Samsung from personal experience.\n\nI've owned 5 different generations of Apple Ipads as well. I enjoy IOS and Android both.\n\nI had the iPad mini 1 from Apple for a few years. When I moved to an IPad Air the retina screen on the IPad Air made it much easier to read and graphics, games, text were all MUCH better. Resolution is very important when considering eye strain.\n\nSo far I have great enjoyed the Samsung Tab A 8 inch. It is lower screen resolution than the retina display but seems better than the iPad Mini. The Tab A is quick enough and the screen looks really good. Samsung displays in my opinion look better than the Ipads. So even a lower resolution screen like this Tab A still looks great. I love that you can add memory and have tons of storage on this.\n\nI guess the Tab A main competitor would be the IPad mini 2 with Retina display at 229.00 at most retailers. 179 vs. 229 isn't that much difference. The iPad was 269 when I chose the Tab A. The Tab A is a great tablet but the iPad mini 2 is worth a look at only 50.00 more.\n\nStill I am happy with the Tab A and would recommend it to anyone I know.\n\nThe screen is nice and bright and still looks great."}

Second one is now rebooting randomly, crashing and shows glitchy green lines on the screen when it's acting up. The third so far is still working but if two of the three are either dead or dying I'm sure this third one will soon die too. I am not happy with this, a tablet should last a long time. I have an iPad 3rd generation I bought a few years ago and it's still going strong, had absolutely no issues with it. Samsung has known issues with their products, in till they address battery issues, motherboard issues, etc I won't buy another one again. I'd rather buy a big phone and use that as a tablet or get another ipad before I buy a another Samsung. These were our first Samsung tablets, and we had such short lived products that it turned me off from wanting to buy another or recommend them to anyone."}

It sounds like a good idea, but the problem is that this feature makes it easy for kids to bypass parental control software.  There is no way to get around this without rooting the device, which will void the warranty.  For this reason, I would not recommend this tablet for kids.

I did a lot of research on tablets, and I was looking for one that had the ability to transfer apps to the SD card. There were many that said they could, but when I did further research, they actually could not, so don't be fooled. The screen size on this tablet was 8, and I am used to using a 7 screen, but I am now a HUGE fan of the 8 screen this one has. The processer was 1.5 GB ram, and it runs so fast and smooth. I got a 16 GB and added a 16 GB SD card, and I have tons of room. We also have a nexus 7 tablet, and I was looking for something comparable to that, and this one did, and exceeded my expectations. The nexus 7 does not allow an SD card, so this is an upgrade from that tablet for sure.  Also, I am huge into the online game apps, and I have installed 13 of my game apps on it, in addition to many other apps within the first week, with no problems at all. I have so much room on it, it is amazing. I have read many reviews that say the screen quality on this particular tablet was not good, and I have found that to be false in my opinion. This tablet came with the home charger, which was something some other tablets I reviewed did not all come with. I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for a fast, high capacity tablet that is not so expensive that you have to mortgage your house to own one."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "First, many thanks to Amazon! Outstanding service, as always!\nSamsung Galaxy Tab A 8\" Tablet. I purchased it because my 4\" Galaxy Player has a very old version of Android: 2.3.5. Therefore some of my beloved applications start disappearing because their creators upgraded them for a higher Android version. So sad. My little player was and still is the best hardware there is with all the bells and whistles that many of the new tablets can't match today.\nSo, my experience with Samsung's tablet:\n8\" is too big for my little hands. Holding it to read a book or the news with one hand is a pain. Try both hands, and you'll find your fingers on the screen, which, normally will make the tablet to respond to some commands and switch the screens, open up other apps...and so forth. And I have the continuous sensation that the tablet wants to slip an fall all the time.\nAnother annoying feature is the screen brightness. Yes, I did try to set it up from Auto On/Off. In the dark, at night, it darkens. In the daylight, brightens. Very strange way of acting and totally stubborn despite the settings. Missing a + and - for manually adjusting it. (Because in the top front of screen there is a sensor that watches you and adjust the brightness of the screen based on if thinks you are looking at it or not? how maddening is that? The tablet knows better what you need? How hard is to push a + or a -  /setting ????\nThe most annoying issue is on how the Marshmallow, 6.0 is distorting the resolution on some applications. Didn't they learned that when upgrading to a new OS version, the video capacity of the computers(tablets) is to be considered?\nAll my beloved puzzle games are not plastered on an 8\" screen, they look like a tank rolled over them, if you ever booted your Windows OS in Safe Mode, you know what I see here.\nThe tablet came with the Lollypop, but once you unpack it, set it up and connect it online, it automatically updates, upgrades and so on.\nSo, in 5 minutes from connecting I had the Marshmallow, 6.01. (btw, fabulous fast connectivity and speed from my unlocked T-Mobile WiFi hotspot device).\nI am sick and tired being used by Microsoft over the years of being an unpaid - but - paying tester of their OS. It seems that Google is now doing the same.\nHowever, looking at it, the tablet is very attractive, and I won't contest most buyers here are satisfied. And congratulations to all! Overall, it is a good buy. Samsung and Amazon are both in my heart.\nBut based on my personal inability to handle the device (hands too small) I have to return it, and I am really sorry.\nIf anyone returns it, please don't forget: Delete the Google account you created in the tablet (not your gmail account!), then reset it to the factory settings before returning it. Because that's the nice thing to do."}

I guess that the screen dimensions are determined by the resolution, 1024 x 768 (4:3). Although I prefer the features of the Samsung I can comfortably hold the Lenovo Tab 2 A8-50f with a resolution of 1200 x 800 (3:2).\n\nOne feature I miss in the Tab A 8 is the expanded clipboard of the Tab 4 7.0. While the Tab A 8 does have an expanded clipboard accessible on the keyboard within many apps it is not like the earlier version which allowed for 20 entries,  10 of which could be locked so that you could use them like keyboard macros.\n\nThe Tab A 8 does not work well for me for composing text but it does well for viewing existing content like videos."}

I couldn't possibly have set up the tablet myself, and in fact, it took my very savvy computer guru several hours to set it up and to teach me how to do basic things on it.  So I suppose I would have to say that it isn't ideal for the novice or the faint of heart.  But I'm sure that once I have a chance to practice and experiment with it, I will grow to be less cautious and terrified of it.  There is much to be liked about it, but the one thing I find both frustrating and annoying is that in writing e-mails, it anticipates the words being typed and as often as not gets them wrong, but types them anyhow, necessitating constant retyping and attentive re-reading of one's messages before clicking \"send.\"  I would have preferred spell-check to this anticipatory feature, which rather than speeding up the composition of a message, actually slows it down considerably.  I've not yet experimented with the tablet's many capabilities and features, including the camera, which I have been told is excellent.  I also have not added any apps.  So this review must be considered somewhat premature and a work-in-progress."}

Rear camera took an adequate picture, and the front is of course fairly low resolution.  Screen was bright and clear, gave a good enough picture on Netflix and YouTube to be easily watchable.\n\nPhysically the tablet is very light and slim.  It feels as if it's a bit fragile, so I'll be very careful with it until its new case arrives."}

It is the perfect price point (169.00) for the size (8.0\"), Space 16GB + SD Slot for up to 128GB, and the screen does the job well for basics like email and video quality is good. It's dropped to $139 and that is a STEAL for the specs.\n\nSince I have the Samsung S7, I can use SideSync to take/make phone calls and respond to texts.\n\nYou can't go wrong AT ALL with the Tab A.

Bought him a tablet so he could have the mobility in and around his house, and not have to be stuck at his desktop PC all the time. He's been using it for about a week now and has enjoyed it so far. This is his first tablet and he has been able to figure things out on his own.  He's accessed the Internet, figured out to get to the Google Play Store to download apps, has actually downloaded and used some game apps, and taken pictures with it so far.  He's enjoyed the learning process and the mobility of having a tablet.  Now he's able to sit outside on the deck and play Sudoku!  Hope this helps!  Will provide another update in a few weeks. If you have found my review helpful, please indicate below."}

Text is pixelated.  Hurts my eyes to read it. Sound is bad.  I knew the OS was outdated but was willing to take a chance for the price.  No updates were available.  Feels like cheap plastic and would break easily. I have an older galaxy tab that samsung won't update but for the short time the OS was relevant it was nice."}

I play Clash of Clans, Boom Beach, Real Racing 3, Airborne 8, and several others, but those 4 are the ones that would kill my old Samsung *note with a stylus* in an HOUR.  They were battery hogs, so I wanted a battery sipper.\n\nThe battery smart manager program is insane! Limits background usage, and I've had it off the charge (while using it for games) for almost 36 hours, while it still showed 26% battery!!!!  I don't have the screen very bright, about 1/4th of the way up, I use it inside, and I'm not exactly sure how much more battery would be used if it were say, halfway up, but only charging it every couple of days is great!  I played on it for about 6 hours straight one day, and while I didn't realize I'd been on it that long, it still showed 45% or so on the battery. It looks good, it's plastic, so is almost everything nowdays, so don't be discouraged by nit-picking. This is a great tablet, at an amazing price!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "I have been using this tablet pretty heavily since I got it about 4 months ago. I am a college student as well as an entrepreneur, and I use this device for school work, working on my online store, and for some apps and games that are just entertainment. pro's and con's below:\n\nPros:\n- The major selling point for me was microsoft office. To be able to use word and excel while away from my house without my lugging around my laptop is a pretty big deal for me. I got a keyboard case to go with it of course, but that isn't relevant to this review\n\n-It is fast, I can run multiple apps all day long with no problems at all. searching the web, making documents, playing games are all flawlessly quick.\n\n-Battery life, Did I mention I use this all day? No problems with the battery so far. I just make sure I charge it every night and there are no problems all day long. on the off chance I do forget I plug it in while I am doing something else and it charges reasonably quickly.\n\n-Look and feel. This is a pretty decently built device. It doesn't look or feel cheap. Also the size (8 inch) is perfect.\n\n-Screen clarity and resolution. The screen resolution is the one complaint I have seen on here, but I honestly don't know why. It looks good, and for all of the things I use it for, it is perfect. Sure this isn't an ultra high definition screen, but so what? To each their own I suppose.\n\nCon's\n\n-If I think of any, or anything changes I will edit this review. As of now, literally no complaints."}

Skipping to the punch line, the 7.0 went back to Amazon the next day and I got the Tab A 8.0 the day after that. My wife loves it. Resolution? Pixels? Processor? Android Version? My wife couldn't care less. The 4:3 display is bright and colorful & the tablet is fast.\n\nWould I have bought it for myself? No. I bought the 8.0 Tab S2 6 months ago because I buy the best electronics products I can afford regardless of the price/performance ratios. This is no knock on the S2...I would make the same decision again today. The 320 ppi AMOLED display is gorgeous and it is fast...but really no faster than the A 8.0 for the way my wife uses her tablet. Why? The S2 needs the Quad Core processors and the higher performance GPU to push everything out on to that beautiful screen. The processor on the Tab A has a lot less work to do and it does it remarkably well...especially for a $169 tablet. Can I tell the difference when I put this tablet and my S2 side by side? You bet...but in this case that was quite beside the point.\n\nSo consider the user's needs and/or check the tablet out yourself before dismissing it because of the specs."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "I bought this tablet because I trust Samsung.  It worked fine for a month; I use it mostly as an ereader for both Kindle and Nook.  I was reading earlier and turned it off.  When I returned an hour later, it didn't  turn on.  The end of the tablet near the charging port had become too hot to touch.\nI won't be buying Samsung again."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "Alright so I bought this tablet on QVC. The model I have is the SM-T350.\n\nI did a little digging before I purchased this, because I wanted a tablet that could play a few games that were available in the Chrome Store. I would have gone with a Kindle had the game, Kingdom Hearts: Unchained X, was available through the Kindle App store.\n\nThis is my first tablet and besides playing a few apps, there were other various features that I was looking for before purchasing a tablet.\n\nI was wanting one that I could easily navigate the internet,  email, read books, play games and hold photos, Netflix, and of course access to the DishAnyWhere app.\n\nWhat I was not expecting was the ability to have access to the Samsungs Kindle app which allows users to purchase and read books off amazon, and not have to go through the Amazon app itself. On top of that there are sketch/drawing apps that have capabilities similar top line Art programs like Sai and CS, which you can get for FREE through the Galaxy gifts program.\n\nI also did not realize that this tablet comes with a rear/front cameras which are pretty good, although, I probably will not use these much. I will say the clarity on the camera is quite decent for a tablet, but I feel that it could be better in terms of clarity.\n\nA fun  feature with this tablet is that with apps like DishAnyWhere or other various apps you can use your tablet as a remote to change the channel, which is a fun way to mess with people at times.\n\nOther apps that come with this tablet are: Microsoft's Word, Powerpoint, Excel, OneNote, OneDrive and of course Skype. Sp, for a student going to college this tablet will be perfect for taking notes in class as well as with the OneDrive you will never have to worry about losing any documents because the OneDrive is Microsoft's version of the Cloud.\n\nThe sound on this device is amazing for me, music plays so clearly as well as and shows I have played on Netflix and Dish are crystal. So with that being said if you want to use this tablet for music, shows or Skype and sound clarity is a must, then this tablet has it in spades.\n\nThe downside for me with this tablet is the bloatware, which are unneeded apps, and I believe that these apps are hindering my tablet from charging at a rapid pace. It takes my tablet to almost fully charge 4 - 5 hours, and it may not even be the apps but another issue which I have yet to figure out.\n\nHowever, if it is the apps, you can easily remove them through certain apps in the Chrome Store. However, just be fully away that these apps are 'part' of the system and removal of certain apps will null and void the device's warranty. So before removing these apps, WAIT til the warranty expires.\n\nOn the upside, while I do use my tablet frequently it does take awhile for the battery life to go down. So that is the plus to the battery charging issue.\n\nSo to sum it up: This is a fantastic tablet that is perfect for anyone. Sound, picture and versatility of this tablet is astounding. This little guy comes with apps perfect for any upcoming or current college student. The only issue with this is how long it takes to charge, but thats nullified by how long it lasts OFF the charger."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "I got this as a gift when my old Tab 3 died on me, and I'm happy that I did. The larger sized screen on this one (8 as opposed to my old one being 7) makes typing a lot easier. The screen is also very crisp and clear and I have no problem with the resolution as other reviewers complained about.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful, clear screen\n\nThe colors on everything are nice\n\nApps load and run quickly and play perfectly\n\nThe speeds of things (for the most part, see my 'cons' list) are really fast\n\nThe split screen feature seems nice, but I only used it once and I don't need it really\n\nThe tablet itself is pretty lightweight and comfortable\n\nThe rear camera is REALLY nice, the auto-focus is great, and it takes very clear nice photos in the daytime. Nighttime photos varies depending on the amount of lighting\n\nCons:\nBrowser & Youtube speeds - I find that Chrome crawls and loads pages slowly, even mobile versions. Often I wait quite a long time for something to load on a page, or the youtube app will show the spinning wheel for quite some time. I didn't have this issue with the older Tab 3 with browsing, but I did with Youtube so perhaps it's an issue with Youtube's app? Either way, browser speeds were sluggish.\n\nFingerprints show up BIG TIME on the glass. The first time I used it and put it down I could see every detail of where my fingers had been.\n\nThe front facing camera is awful in every lighting. I found myself trying to awkwardly take pictures with the back camera instead of the front because the front one is just bad. I'm also really not feeling the facial beauty thing it does on self photos and I haven't found a way to turn it off yet. It also doesn't appear to have the auto focus the rear camera does."}

It say you can add up to 128gb sd card.  The problem is many, if not most apps will not load to the card.  By the time I finished loading the apps I use the onboard memory was almost full.  The tablet at times seemed to really down and I am wondering if that was because of the memory issue.  I ended up calling Samsung and the said that there is no 'fix' and no software update was going to fix this issue.  They said they would take it back for a full refund.  I think there reasoning is that if you want more memory you need to purchase a much more expensive tablet."}

I have purchased other products from them, was really happy at the \"deals\" I got, and got them covered with an extended warranty through Square Trade. It occurred to me I hadn't covered this tablet and tried to do so. After jumping through a ton of hoops, I was informed Amazon changed its policy and no longer offers Square Trade warranties for Amazon Warehouse. The other two warranty suggestions I received got so many horrible reviews from users, I wondered why these were even available at Amazon.\n\nTo add insult to injury, I purchased a lovely case to protect this beautiful tablet, set it down on the window sill and it slipped off and cracked ... in the case! Ugh! Thank goodness I bought it with my American Express card, which protects purchases (including drops) in the first 90days. That said, please keep in mind that Amazon will NOT help you with quality warranties on Warehouse merchandise AND, not for nothing, but I'm a little unhappy that the tablet is so \"fragile\" (?) that the screen cracks so easily, and very unhappy that the cover offered such little protection. I am very careful with my things & often have them for YEARS, so I am a bit disappointed in the fragility of this product.\n\nOriginal review: I am very happy with the Samsung tablet. I have watched more than  a few on demand videos now and don't understand the criticism of picture/screen quality - it's beautiful. I have the 8\" Tab A and couldn't be happier with my decision. I charged it fully when I got it on Sunday (!); today is Friday and I am only now charging it again. Mind you, the battery was at about 46%. Incredibly decent. And during that time, I watched about 3 hours of video content, checked email daily and left WiFi on. My cover puts the tablet to sleep when closed and wakes it up when opened, so it has not been shut down in six days. I have access to all the apps I could need and LOVE that it comes loaded with Microsoft Office - giving me access to Word, Excel  and Power Point.  I don't know how well the camera and video work yet but will update if something is amis. I had this on my Wish list and kept an eye for a deal. I spotted one in the Amazon Warehouse, listed in very good condition for $151.00 vs. $195.00. I would say it is BRAND new and cannot imagine email you could see a difference! Outstanding. The tablet was still in the cellophane with plugs and cords. Very pleased and would definitely recommend AND buy again."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "I compared the 9.7\" and the 8\" at a store, I bought the 8\" because the screen is sharper. Even though the 9.7\" has a larger screen, the 8\" is better for reading because the pixels are closer together. The 8\" is also cheaper and is easier to hold, there are hundreds(if not thousands) of apps for Android which make this tablet highly functional yet easy to use. The 8\" only has one speaker but that's not a big deal, I use headphones to listen to music and watch movies."}

I don't care about or can download myself if I want to: Skype, Netflix, Word, Excel, PowerPoint and some more. Why is it most manufacturers believe this will help? I would be better to let the owner decide. 2) Anothe other reason I took a star away is Lollipop 5.02... Really..? On 2016...? Lollipop (Android 5 was released on 2014). Yes, I know Samsung promised Lollipop for the Tab A... but when...? 2018..? This is now a ONE YEAR OLD tablet, that came with an ALREADY OLD ANDROID VERSION and STILL HAS NO UPDATE TO MARSHMALLOW, so I've stopped dreaming about \"N\". Next tablet will be a Nexus. No doubt about it!\n\nFelt good to let that out of my system. Now, on the good side, the 4:3 format is just great, and the 8 inches is like the perfect size. I come from a Tab 2 7.0 oldie and I prefer tablets I can hold on one hand. For the record: I use the tablet for study during the day and some reading on the bed.\n\nFinally, the original Samsung clamp is also great. It holds to the Tab A with a special lock the Tab has, and looks nice! It has a reasonbale price."}

After reading those reviews and finding the resolution is similar between sizes, I chose the 8 inch for cost efficiency. It's the right size for on-the-go and the resolution is beautiful. I was able to get this tablet, a one year warranty and a case and screen protectors well under the cost of the 9.7 inch tablet.

Beautiful screen, and I've read a few complaints about the speakers on here, but, they are actually not too bad. I think it's a great tablet. Only down side is it comes with a butt load of apps, some of which he will never use, and can't get rid of. On a positive note, he did enjoy a couple of those apps, which he had never heard of before. This was definitely a great purchase!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "Sometimes I think that people giving products like this a 5-star review are either shills or hopelessly ignorant.  I am giving this review based on how this product works out-of-the-box.  First, the good things: lightweight, comfortable to hold, good screen for viewing, and it feels like it is well-built.  Because Samsung is a popular brand, there is no shortage of accessories for this device. Now I'll list some of the problems with the Samsung Galaxy Tab A: Wi-Fi  speed 35 Mbps drops to 6 Mbps when Bluetooth is enabled.  You can imagine what will happen if your initial speed is much slower than 35 Mbps! Why should I sacrifice speed because I happen to be connected to a Bluetooth speaker while listening to music? I shouldn't. This is a well-known issue with Samsung products (none of my other devices have this issue) and clearly Samsung doesn't care enough to do anything about it. Next point: This tablet gives priority to it's stock apps. So, do you want to use Chrome or Firefox instead of Samsung's stock \"Internet\" app for browsing?  Good luck with that. Sure, you can set your preferred browser as default, but that doesn't matter. The stock browser will not disable, and every time you click a link it will annoy you with an \"Always\" or \"Just Once\" option. You click \"Always\" but that doesn't matter either because it will keep asking you with every link you click.  If you intend to use this tablet for anything more than the simplest task; think again!  I was forced to void my warranty by rooting this tablet and removing apps that Samsung should have given us the option to disable.  There are so many tiny problems that make this tablet a headache to use. In conclusion, unless you are also willing to root and possibly use a custom ROM stay away from this tablet."}

If you tend to armor your electronics as I do you might want to shop around for something just a bit larger, but that's the Basics case, not the Tablet. Android 5 autocorrect is very aggressive and not very smart, so be careful if you're in email or on Spacebook before you've finished a cup of coffee. I had returned a Kit Kat tablet because I need to space on my external SD. Win. I actually travelled to Europe with a tablet and Bluetooth keyboard for a month's study, and so far this one is holding up very well as my portable word processor as well. Last, watched a movie with my girlfriend using the keyboard stand (before the Rhino case came). Very sharp picture without viewing angle issues, and exceptional sound, and less than 30% battery depletion for a two hour film on Netflix. I haven't watched anything since putting it in the Rhino, and I hope that doesn't disrupt the excellence of the volume and clarity of the sound. Overall, if you need or want a smaller tablet, are generally happy with the Samsung brand (as I am), this is the tablet for you."}

I bought the Tab A 8 inch. I have never been so disappointed.  For some reason Samsung lowered the screen resolution to  far less quality.  My daughters tab 4 looked nicer heck even my 2012 Nexus 7 had a better screen resolution.  I know it didn't bother some people but for me it was noticeable to make small print have fuzzy edges.

As an amazon prime member, I can download prime music to the ext sd card for offline play.  I can also download amazon prime video for offline play also (as of this review  it only downloads prime video to the internal storage).  My google music subscription service also will download to the ext sd card for offline.  The handful of movies I own via google will also download to the ext sd card.  This is such a nice feature!  The one speaker is loud and has solid sound.  The screen is very bright (I find myself only needing 50 to 75% brightness). Some have concerns about the pixels since this is not full hd but I find the pictures to be very crisp & colors are rich and inviting.  Text looks nice too.  Hbo go, Netflix & hulu work fantastic.  I tried a cpl of lower end tablets but for this new low price, this Samsung tablet leads the pack.  I don't like touchwiz so I downloaded the official google launcher  it works w/o issue.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "The Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8\" tablet is a great budget-oriented tablet that will wonderfully meet the needs of many. I picked one up to play with and evaluate as a possible tablet for an elderly woman who wanted something for email, movies, web surfing, and reading. I ended up opting for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Fire-HD-8-8-34-HD-Display-Wi-Fi-16-GB-Includes-Special-Offers-Blue/dp/B00UIEBTWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Fire HD 8, 8\" HD Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers, Blue</a>. Let me share my thoughts on this tablet and why I opted for something different.\n\nScreen: The 8\" screen size is a nice jump from typical 7\" screens - lots of extra viewing area while still being easy to hold (tougher to do when you move to 10\" tablets). It is important to note that the Tab A has a lower resolution than most other 8\" tablets -- 1024 x 768. Even most name brand 7\" tablets have a higher resolution. Whether this is a deal killer depends on what your needs are. For everyday tasks, the resolution is just fine. From movies to web surfing, you get a pretty good experience. And for those like me who now need reading glasses, there is an upside - the font size appears larger than it does on 8\" screens with higher resolutions. However, everything will appear a little less sharp / crisp. This is perhaps most noticeable when viewing text.  This is not to say the experience is bad. But if you are accustomed to a higher resolution screen, you'll probably notice the difference (you'll acclimate quickly, but going down in image quality is not the direction you typically want to go!). I am pleasantly surprised by the screen brightness & colors.\n\nPerformance:  This has 1.5 GB of RAM, which is 50% more than the Kindle Fire HD 8. Other tablets of have 2GB or even 3GB of RAM (to put this into perspective), but the RAM is enough that the tablet is responsive -- open apps and other tasks all work quickly.\n\nStorage:  This tablet has 16GB of storage -- not a lot (keep in mind that a good bit of this is taken up by the operating system), but decent. I do NOT often recommend 8GB tablets. Even with a microSD slot for added storage (which this tablet has), a base of 16GB internal storage is recommended. Aside from the extra space it gives you for storing media, it gives you ample room for apps.  Performance on tablets will really begin to suffer when the internal storage fills up.  I recommend buying a microSD card and using that to store all of your media.\n\nAesthetics:  Samsung always does well here, and the Tab A is no exception. It is attractive and feels good in your hand. However, you will want a case -- both for protection as well as to make gripping the tablet easier.\n\nOS:  This comes with Android (Lollipop). Mine came with version 5.02. This is a solid, recent version of Android, but I don't expect it will see an upgrade to Android 6.0, which is just beginning to roll out to flagship mobile devices.  I do prefer a more stock version of Android to that of Amazon's Fire OS.\n\nCameras:  On the plus side, you get both front- and rear-facing cameras. That's nice. Just don't expect high quality.  Still images shot in good lighting will be decent. Just don't view this as a replacement for a real camera.\n\nI test a lot of tablets, and currently have about 10 of them on or around my desk. The Samsung Tab A 8\" is really pleasant to use, even with its lower resolution screen. Few are likely to be disappointed by it, and it is reasonably priced for an 8\" tablet, which obviously price a bit higher than 7\" models (of which there are so many more to choose from). It's nearest competitor is probably the Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8, and compared to that, it is worthy of 4 stars. The Kindle Fire HD 8 is priced significantly less, has a higher resolution screen, and comes in a choice of 4 colors. The only real downside to the Fire tablet is that you can't run the Google Play Store and may have to do without some apps (e.g. Instagram - though it is possible to \"side load\" apps).\n\nBottom line:  A solid tablet offering a great user experience, but definitely consider the Kindle Fire HD unless you find this on sale."}

The quality of tech support, including at the Texas repair facility, is the worst imaginable.  When it works this is a nice product, but plan on the warranty being worthless...actually less than worthless as it will cost you a lot of time.  While I knew this was a Korean company, I had South Korea in mind, my mistake."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "I've had this tablet about 6 months now and I LOVE IT! I purchsed from another in store retailer. I've had multiple Kindle Fire/HD models, Fuhu android tablets (nabis), current phone is an Apple, and while I've never owned an iPad many of my family members in my home do, so I've used them. *UPDATE* in fact, I love this tablet so much for myself that I just purchased 2 certified refurbished ones for my children and am ditching their nabi tablets.\n\nI'm not going to bore you with specs because they're already listed, and many reviewers have also elaborated. I will say many people complain about the low screen resolution. While the specs are lower than comparable tablets- I  do NOT even notice. Seriously, unless you have hawk eyes it's really not a big deal. I wonder what they are looking for or expect from a tablet viewing experience. I've been streaming vids from various streaming apps, cable apps, and Amazon video- all look just fine to me. I haven't gone back to my Kindle Fire HD 2012 7\" since I purchased this! And I watch/ download/ stream a couple hours of shows every single day. LOVE!\n\nI will also say the WiFi where I am is not the greatest- all of the other mentioned devices in my home constantly drop and buffer and cannot connect in certain parts of my home; after a week of daily use, this thing has not once buffered or dropped the streaming. So, when compared to about 5 other devices (even the iPad- gasp)! this tablet is far superior in keeping the WiFi signal.\n\nBattery life is insane. I haven't timed it to know exactly, but I do know it lasts forever. Especially in sleep/ stand-by mode- YAY! I can easily get a day of moderate useage and then some.\n\nSound is good, not great. But, it has only one speaker so that took me some getting used to as opposed to my previous double speakers. But- again- it serves the purpose and works just fine. Can hear all vids and music just great.\n\nThe split screens is cool! I like being able to multitask and web browse or social media WHILE also checking my email on the screen at the same time- no need to close out an app. Not all apps have this function but most do. You can also have a \"floating\" app and drag it around on the screen while muslitasking in the background or in another app (on most apps).\n\nUsing a bluetooth keyboard right now to type this review on the tablet. Connects just perfect and no dropping the signal.\n\nIt is SPEEDY- never loads, drags, freezes, or pauses. win win win. Swipes seamlessly and flawlessly and opens all apps immediately- no pausing.\n\nFeels sleek and good in the hands. I think this is the perfect size, for me at least. :) Small enough to be portable comfortably but big enough to see and do what I need to do on it.\n\nI purchased the Platnium PT folio from Best Buy and it fits like a glove. It also wakes/ sleeps the tablet when the folio is opened and closed. Nice! (...) *UPDATE* 6 months later, said folio still looks like NEW!\nLollipop OS is great. No complaints. Nice to see that most Android apps can now be moved and stored to your external SD card, saving your valuable internal storage and giving you much more storage.\n\nThe included \"kid mode\" is a great addition and I feel comfortable handing my Samsung over to my children knowing they are only using their parent approved apps, cannot make purchases, or mess with settings. This Kid Mode app can be installed from the Included Galaxy App Store.\n\nComes with Microsoft Office Apps included.\n\nFront and rear cameras work great.\n\nI use this tablet for web browsing, email, and social media mostly. After owning Apple products and other androids, this was my first Samsung. I think I'm a Samsunger for life now! Highly recommend, and for the price it's just silly to buy an iPad when this is the same or better, for half the price! This is nearly the same size as the iPad mini, which my husband has. They look almost identical at first glance side by side.\n\nI'll update if I think of anything to add. Feel free to ask questions and I'll do my best to answer. I'm still very pleased with this purchase, 6 months later! :)\n\n*UPDATE #2* June 2016 and still love this tablet. On it now! Folio still looks great.  No issues for any!"}

So, I went for a tablet for reading, browsing, and writing. I knew I didn't want a small tablet, and I didn't want it to be too big either. This 8 inch was just right.\n\nMine came with Lollipop. Microsoft free apps were preloaded. I got a Logitech bluetooth keyboard to work with it, so worth it. I got a great cover, also worth it.\n\nI have no problems with the screen resolution, its awesome! I don't use it for games, but I did load some educational apps.  I have not overloaded it yet. The 16 Gbytes is a pretty big space to fill. Even so I got a flash card.\n\nThe rear camera is great. I took great video at the Butterfly house with it. Yeah, no zoom. Otherwise, super great video and super easy. It was surprisingly comfortable to hold up for long periods of time as well.\n\nWith the keyboard, its like a more portable and lighter laptop. But its better than a laptop."}

I do a lot of traveling, and hotel TVs don't allow Chromecast or other wifi devices, so the stream function on the  Nexus 7 was greeat to have.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "The tablet screen resolution is insufficient, and the content will be cast to only a partial area of your TV screen.  At least this is the case with Google Chromecast.  The cast resolution on the TV is the same as that on the tablet, which is 1024 x 768.  This is not even enough for 720p HD which specifies a resolution of 1280 x 720.  It certainly would be a problem for 1080p HDTV that has 1920 x 1080, not to even mention the newer 4K panels.\n\nThe low screen resolution of this tablet is also a problem for reading.  If you are watching videos on the screen, you can hardly notice any resolution issue. Human eyes simply aren't that sensitive toward ultrahigh resolution on a moving screen.  If you view static photos, the difference becomes more noticeable, although you may still not notice the difference unless compared side-by-side.  But if you read texts, the pixelation is very noticeable. For some reason, human eyes are much more sensitive when reading text than viewing images.\n\nOther than these shortcomings, this seems to be a quite good product. Fast and responsive. Build quality and screen quality are very high."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "This tablet arrived today so it is a little early for a full review, but I will review anyway.  I was looking for a lightweight, fast, and reliable Android table for under $300. This one definitely exceeds my expectations (and at a great price). My husband has a new ipad (not air) that I think its too bulky. Also, I don't love iOS and am not a fan of itunes.  So Apple was out for me.  I was worried Samsung would add too many layers on top of the pure Android experience, but Lollipop (it upgraded already!) seems to have minimal overt Samsung modifications (at least none that bother me).\n\nI am not a heavy video consumer but the few videos I did watch (you tube) looked great to me.\nStrongly recommend this table at this price point!\n\nUpdate:\nI've had it for a few days and still love a lot about it.  What I don't love: even though I don't watch a lot of video content, the resolution difference between this tablet and my phone is enormous.  I didn't think it would matter to me -- but it does.  I like reading websites on my phone better, which defeats one of the purposes of this tablet. Also, the touch screen isn't always as responsive as I'm used to.  I haven't seen anyone else mention this in the Tab A, so maybe it is just this device. I also get a lag sometimes that I never get on my Moto X (phone).  I'm leaning toward returning it right now even though I still think it is a great tablet otherwise.  Changed from 5 to 4 stars."}

I do believe 6-12 months from now (around the Christmas season perhaps) they will release a high resolution one just as Apple did.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "After a week of usage I love this little tablet. I have been using iPads since they were initially released and have had a few. This one blows them right out of the water. The battery life is amazing. I fully charged the device when I got it and ran it through some tests. Streaming video from Netflix for 8 consecutive hours took the battery from 100% to 72% Side by side with my 4th generation iPad doing the same test the battery on the iPad drained to 15%. Yes, I'm sure the battery being new has something to do with it. but impressive nonetheless.\n\nI setup the kids mode and allow my 4 year old son to play with it. He loves it and the kids mode allows him to play without any worry of accidental purchases, or getting into something he shouldn't.\n\nAlso the added free software they include is quite nice. The full MS Office suite comes pre-loaded which is surprisingly nice to have. I deal with a lot of Spreadsheets for work and it has allowed me to keep my laptop in my bag and handle things from the tablet.\n\nI expanded the memory with a 128 GB micro SD. For the same amount of storage with the iPad it would cost more then buying 3 of these.\n\nAll that being said, The screen is not as sharp as I would like. But if that's not a big deal to you this thing is a winner.\n\nI feel confident in making a recommendation for this product, and plan on buying one for my parents and siblings this Christmas."}

More inviting than a full-size laptop and easy to use anywhere (the car, the kitchen table, etc.), which makes it easier to get past writers block  (I can use my smartphone as a Wi-Fi hotspot for internet connectivity if need be). The 8\" is just the right size for me--screen is big enough to read web pages comfortably but still very portable . No complaints about the screen resolution (I don't watch video on it or play games).  Bluetooth connectivity works well (occasional, rare, connection blips).  Long-lasting charge.

This isn't a BAD tablet, but it's a $199 tablet at best. Over all it's fine for web browsing and reading books but not good for anything more than that. It struggles with anything graphic intensive.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00V49LNCU", "review": "I recently upgraded from a rather low-end Dell 7\" Venue tablet to this Samsung 8\" model. The differences are quite striking. First of all, it doesn't seem like Samsung makes anything low-end. The Tab A is packed with features, speed and plenty of memory. Not to mention screen size. The tablet's quad core CPU and generous 16GB of memory runs circles around every other tablet I have owned.\n\nMy favorite feature about the Tab A is its responsiveness. There is no CPU lag, even on the most demanding applications. You can stream videos in full HD with no slowing down or buffering. The touch screen itself is also quite responsive. You barely need to touch the screen for the Tab to switch to the next application or turn to the next page. If I had to choose a single word to describe this tablet, it would be \"snappy\".\n\nThe display itself is extremely bright and easy to read. Using the built-in Amazon Kindle app I was able to load up my account and delve straight into the last book I was reading, which looked noticeably more crisp than it did on my last tablet. Turning OFF the adaptive brightness made viewing much easier and the display much brighter. Keeping that feature on makes the display seem quite dull and dark most of the time.\n\nThere may not be any lag when watching HD videos, but the video itself does seem a bit washed out and fuzzy. I tried watching a number of videos on the Galaxy A Tab, and they all pretty much looked the same. If you are running apps or just reading, the video resolution is no problem, but if you are buying an 8\" tablet to watch movies on you may be a bit disappointed in this model's performance.\n\nMy last comment is on the usual bloatware built-in to most Android devices these days. There are a number of apps that come bundled on the Galaxy A Tab that you probably will never use, but nonetheless take up plenty of space and memory. You may be able to disable them, but it is utterly impossible to delete them as Android will replace them with \"upgrades\" in the background every time it syncs to Android Play. To say this is annoying is putting it mildly. Pretty much every app that Google has ever made comes pre-installed on the device along with a number by Samsung. Other than Chrome and Google Search I did not find many of them useful.\n\nAll in all, the Galaxy Tab A is great as a reader and for running most apps. As a platform for streaming video it falls a bit flat though."}

The quality of video looks great but the resolution puts most video's (such as youtube) in a widescreen view when in full screen mode.

We were hoping to use it as a basic video camera for capturing video of our new baby. The SD card expansion made it a lot cheaper than an iPad mini with similar storage. Sadly the camera is awful and the video is just ok. It's definitely a bright light camera only. If there is movement at all it will be blurry. I'd say the camera is like a 10 year old digital camera. Barely usable. The screen lags bad as you turn on the camera. I suppose that's related to the slower processer others have mentioned. For what I wanted this tablet for I regret my purchase. My iPhone 5 and old iPad mini take superior pics and video. At least I got a good deal on it and technically it's a working, up to date android tablet. Just not going to recommend it to anyone.
