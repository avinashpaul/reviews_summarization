{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "Does not come with an optical drive - looks like they're making that pretty clear now, but when I bought one there were pictures of an optical drive with a disc.\n\nThere is just a plastic space where the optical drive would be - but to remove this spacer and install a DVD-RW drive, or a caddy to hold a hard drive or SSD (there is a SATA port under there) you have to take the whole laptop apart. It's screwed in, and the screw is internal. Very annoying and a bad design.\n\nThe battery is also internal and you have to take the whole thing apart to get to that too.\n\nIt comes with Windows 8.1 but no sticker with a key, so if you need to re-install the OS, be sure to use a software tool to find your Windows key number first.\n\nScreen is fairly low resolution - the standard inexpensive notebook screen. No surprise at this price though, it's reasonable.\n\nYou do get a lot for the money, but there are better choices - several other brands offer $250 laptops with the same specs. Another brand that also starts with A has one that is thinner and the plastic spacer where the optical drive goes can be easily removed with 1 screw on the bottom on the unit.\n\nOne advantage of this unit is that it has the numeric keypad on the keyboard, and some of the $250 models from other brands do not."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "Bought mine elsewhere in 2014 and still going. I believe I paid $200 plus tax at my local computer dealer, on sale. Mine came with CD/DVD Rom so I don't know why the one in this listing doesn't have one. I too have run a few flavors of Ubuntu Linux, including Mint from live CD and USB and they ran great. It has slowed down over the past year but it's overdue for a good hard drive cleaning. Had some issues upgrading to Windows 10 and finally gave up and rolled back to 8.1. Apparently this machine won't function with Windows 10 once you blacklist all the Microsoft servers. It fails to boot without connecting to the Microsoft mothership to upload all your usage data so I rolled back to 8.1 and has been fine since. iOBit reports it having a second unused Ram slot which would make this capable of an upgrade to 8Gb but I've not been able to confirm this and ASUS technical specs say it maxes out at 4Gb. If I get a bur under my saddle I might take it apart and see but probably not. All in all it's been a good little machine with a great display, weird feeling touchpad clicks and a fast and comfortable keyboard so if you're looking at this as an everyday driver for typical use, you won't be disappointed. If you need something for the racetrack then look higher up the food chain as this is no hotrod but like an old VW, it will start and get you to and from your destination just fine but won't win any races. Expect slightly better performance than that of a typical Windows tablet and you should be satisfied."}

I want to do a factory reset but I am scared to because there may not even be a real operating system installed on it."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "I've had this laptop for over 2 years now and I really have been quite pleased overall.  I will say that the packaging was not the most protective of the unit when I first received my order by mail.  But, that did not seem to affect the operation of the computer.\n\nOriginally, I had to replace my beloved Mac laptop, but this was a much more cost effective option.  I've never been a huge fan of PC's, but I figured it certainly won't hurt to be somewhat competent with both systems.  It came loaded with Windows 8.1 and that was not the best operating system,  for numerous reasons, mostly b/c it was not compatible with several apps I wanted like Open Office, and  Windows Defender was not the most effective anti-virus protection.  I was infiltrated several times early on in the first 6 months since purchase.  A co-worker (who was an IT guy) helped me out with several of the free anti-virus programs out there, but I still got infected numerous times.\n\nDuring the first year, when it was still under warranty, I was able to contact ASUS directly and they did a factory reset for me.  This helped clear the whole infection mess, and I appreciated that they could help me in this regard. Eventually I just bit the bullet and went with McAfee--even if I had to pay for it.  No problems since, in the past 2+ years.\n\nOn another note about the year warranty.  Since I was not the most impressed with Windows 8.1 that this came loaded with, I called ASUS to see about actually downgrading to Windows 7.  I would not be able to do this without nullifying the year-long warranty, so that was something I just had to accept (for the time being)\n\nThen came the free Windows 10 upgrade.  I took a while to jump on board (b/c I feared a larger learning curve than I actually needed), but since upgrading, I've been happy with this decision.  I like the format better than those useless tiles of Windows 8.  It's okay to have them some of the time, and with Windows 10, I get to be the one who decides how much of them I want to use (basically, not at all).  I have not yet downloaded Open Office (not a priority at the moment), but I assume it will work on Windows 10.  We'll see.\n\nOf course the most other obvious shortfall is the fact that there is no optical drive in this machine.  But even Mac is discontinuing optical drives in their laptops, and now they are extras to add on, across the board.  I've lived without it for 2 years, but got an external optical drive as a gift this year.  Still haven't chosen an app to play it yet..been lazy to do the research (not a priority).\n\nSo back to the basic premise.  You get quite a lot for the money with this ASUS laptop and even with the headaches I went through, I learned something from them.  I don't believe it was the actual machine that was the biggest issue.  That seemed to stay steady and reliable throughout.  It was the operating system that was the weak point.  But that has been remedied with the Windows 10 upgrade."}

The touchpad feels cheap and plasticy, which is probably my biggest pet peeve with laptops. It comes pre-loaded with the newest edition of windows which is convenient and expected.

Also, if you're just looking for a computer to check your email and browse the web this will more than suffice. However, I wouldn't recommend for intensive software like music production or 3d rendering programs.\n\nIf you're looking for an affordable laptop that will run video games this one will suffice for games that aren't video intensive like WoW.

It does seem a little bit cheap and plasticy for my taste, but if you don't mind aesthetics or complete user comfort then this will be perfect for you. I'd recommend getting a separate keyboard or in the very least a mouse. The trackpad leaves more to be desired."}

Very quiet. Great Linux laptop!\n\nCons: runs Windows poorly, no built-in DVD (but they are cheap to add and not all that useful these days), track pad's buttons require a lot of effort to use.

This issue continued to occur after the laptop was returned 5 months ago when they replaced the board.  Now it won't even power on after the hard reset, and ASUS states that a.) it's out of warranty as of two months ago and, b.) there is only a 90 day warranty on replacement parts.

The first one has a Core i3 processor.  I would have bought a second Core i3 model rather than this Celeron but I could not find one at that moment which came with Windows 8.1.\n\n******  I will NEVER use Windows 10 due to the fascist strategies utilized by Microsoft to force it upon users as well as the telemetry (translated:  your private data)  that it sends to Microsoft servers, which 100% equates to handing over ALL your data to the fascists at the NSA and the rest of our so-called \"government.\"  When a company moves its business model from \"the customer is always right\" to \"you will take what we give you and do as we direct with no questions,\" that should be a red warning flag accented by emergency flares going up.  Everyone should consider this fascism before \"upgrading\" to Windows 10.  Both Win 7 and 8.1 also have back doors, but there are security measures you can take which are now all but voided in Win 10.  If you want your personal and business data stolen and sold to criminals and/or your competition, by all means use Win 10 and the 100% unsecure and vulnerable cloud computing model.  I will move totally to Linux when Win 8.1 is no longer supported.  But I digress.  ******\n\nThis ASUS model with the Celeron is somewhat slower than its Core i3 counterpart.\n\nIt takes longer at startup and longer to shut down.  The response time when you are surfing or running programs is also a little slower.  It is not terribly slower, but there is a lag that I notice compared to the Core i3 unit.  I am thinking that perhaps a RAM upgrade MIGHT help with some of this, but this is uncertain at this point.\n\nIn gaming, I would think that this Celeron model would be virtually unusable in high resource demand programs, though I am not a gamer.  This is merely extrapolated from response times experienced in other programs which are not so resource intensive.\n\nOverall, I would say that the Celeron model is totally acceptable for MS Office, web surfing and other low demand activities.\n\nI am satisfied overall with it considering the price paid, which was about $235 including shipping,  a few dollars cheaper than other vendors.  The seller had it listed at $218 to achieve the low price in Amazon search results but then added $17 shipping.  I have somewhat mixed feelings regarding this type of price manipulation, but nevertheless it is allowed on the site and the apparent result was a slightly lower price."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "I purchased this laptop almost a year ago.  I wanted to replace a kaputt laptop but was feeling broke, and wanted HDMI so I was drawn to this one because it was cheap and had an HDMI port.  I knew that it would not have a CD/DVD drive which was also a big disappointment but I was told by a friend I could get an external one.  Unfortunately what I bought was the wrong thing, so I have been doing without a CD/DVD drive all year.  I was very disappointed when I received the laptop to discover that the battery was embedded - it's the first I've had that's like that and I didn't want to deal with any hardships when I needed to replace a battery.  One year later and it seems I need to replace the battery - it will no longer operate on the battery at all, the instant I unplug it it snaps off.  Up until a few months ago the laptop has been fine for my purposes - I do a lot of Facebook, Netflix, Hulu, Youtube kind of general browsing but not so much with the gaming.  I loaded free adobe office software which is kinda meh but I don't use it that much.  The laptop has maybe had a tendency to not be as slick in handling multiple activities at the same time as a higher-line laptop would be but I didn't have the money to pay for it, did I, so I tolerated a bit of occasional sluggishness.  For all I needed it was perfectly suitable - bright enough colorful enough screen and loud enough speakers.  The keyboard can be a fraction stickier than ideal but again, tolerable for the price!  However, the eventual death-of-battery has arrived and I don't quite know how to deal.  Especially since a few weeks ago (Halloween, so after 9-10 months of use) the touchpad got \"touchy\" and doesn't work right anymore (could possibly have been my fault if a little water from my wet fingers messed it up that day - I'd been cooking).  So now I don't know whether to get the battery replaced somehow (how?), get an external battery (surely just a temporary fix), get another of the same laptop since I am still broke and facing big expenses, or bite the bullet and get a pricier one and hope I can take care of it.\n\nI'm on my laptop a lot and rarely shut it all the way down - would rather leave it in sleep mode and preserve my open programs and tabs.\n\nI was very satisfied with the laptop itself until the touchpad issue came up (possibly my fault) during months 9-10 and then the battery died in month 12."}

That was my criteria, and being such I'm not going to act like a moron and complain that it won't play newer games.\n\nI can't imagine a scenario where writing could tax a system, but I'll go ahead and say it did the job.  For gaming, only the least taxing games will work.  I play WoW and EVE on low settings, and WoW is still kind of choppy.  EVE plays well, if you don't mind the crappy textures.  My desktop is my gaming/modeling rig, so I really didn't care.\n\nBlender runs, and until you start creating some heavy scenes it works well.  It'll lag a bit as you add more to your work, but I've still managed to finish several scenes on planes, waiting to render at home, of course.  Don't render on this laptop.  Unless you have hours upon hours to do something else while you wait.\n\nAs for a travel companion, I really only needed to watch movies, Skype, and keep in contact.  No problems with that.  Loaded several movies, installed MVP player, and HD movies are abound.  Skype works about as well as it ever could.  Meaning it's crap.\n\nThe laptop, however, does its job. A year later, and it's still going strong."}

The laptop seemed to run fine for the most part, but peculiarities with the graphics card forced us to contact ASUS when the screen would turn a strange pink color.  Then, five days after the warranty ran out (purchased on Dec. 13th, failed on Dec. 19th, but not yet a year since it first received use on Dec. 25th), the graphics showed considerable shearing and tearing (image attached) which a reboot would not clear.  After performing some internet searches, it seemed that this laptop suffers this issue frequently, so we sent it back to ASUS for repair and they claimed that the LCD was damage and would only repair the unit for $200.  Since you can get so many NEW laptops for a comparable price from companies that have closer service centers (the only one here in Utah that services ASUS systems is 60+ miles away), this seemed absurd, so we will never purchase ASUS hardware ever again."}

Then the whole thing shuts down and I have to restart the whole process again.\n\nGoing to try and return it tho I hear the customer service is bad? Dunno, wish me luck.\n\nFor the first months it was alright tho, worked pretty well, but yes slowly. I know it's not supposed to be an amazing in terms of processing speed and etc, but when all I have open is one tab for twitter and one low intensity game in the lowest of qualities... and I still can't play the game OR use twitter without massive lag, then it seems like a bit of an issue.\n\nI had an old laptop from about 7 years ago that worked amazing compared to this thing haha. The only way it showed this up was in battery life. for all of what I've said, being able to sit in bed and watch movies on this without worrying about cords to plug in was literally the best experience I had with this. Except for I can't watch my DVDs because there is no disk drive. That's one thing that kinda irked me about it, but definitely not a selling point since you can find most anything online.\n\nSo all in all, I really regret giving my old laptop away for this one. It's decent enough to give it maybe one star, but if you're looking for something you can actually really get some use out of, spend a bit more or find a bargain somewhere else, because this probably isn't what you're looking for."}

Don't get greedy, this computer will give you one that works and one that is just for show.  To top off everything about this awful product, when I turned it on for the first time, it was loaded with computer viruses.  My antivirus protection took a while to clean it up so that it would run properly.  There are many better options for cheap laptops out there.

This was the cheapest, usable laptop I could find when I bought it.\n\nSize - the keyboard and screen are both nice and big (I prefer big).  I guess it might be too big and heavy for some people, but it's not an issue for me.  I use my laptops as pseudo-desktops, so I'm not jetting around with a laptop bag or anything.\n\nConsistency - I've never really had a PROBLEM with the machine.  It's randomly frozen three or four times, and then it'll chug if I throw a big computational operation at it.  But that said, the thing works.\n\nCons:\nHard Drive Memory - it might say so in the specs, but it's not actually 500 GB, it's two 250 GB internal hard drives.  So yes, you get 500 GB, but on separate drives.  I guess it's not a huge deal, but I just don't like switching back and fourth, and I hate working off the secondary (I only use the secondary to backup some important stuff).  This is probably the biggest reason it gets a star knocked off.\n\nTechnology - meh, it would be a higher quality machine in about 2005 or 2006 (so ten year old tech).  Which is fine if you're just surfing the web, using MS Office (Word, Excel, etc).  MATLAB runs fine on this machine.  It's not gonna play any new games, but it plays 10 year old games fairly well (will play Company of Heroes on lower graphics settings).  Can't run too many programs at the same time.\n\nPre-Installed Stuff - Windows 8.1 is okay, I preferred 7.  But MS offers a free update to 10 (which is supposed to be better).  Comes with some bloatware of bloatware (pre-loaded programs you'll never use), but better than most retail computers.\n\nBattery - I think the run time is more like 3 or 4 hours (not the five that's stated in the specs).  And I run at lowest power usage when unplugged.  But as stated, I don't really use my laptops as mobile computers."}

I have A LOT of laptops some 25 or 30 for personal use I've done a lot of testing and reviewing on laptop systems. and as a every day laptop this is actually nice. it sports the cool palm tech. along with a clicky keyboard making for nice every day use.\n\nA lot of people have reported these as dead on arrival. I have two that work perfect. and have tested these \"dead\" units that work perfectly. so to the people saying these don't work. I'm going to say the people don't work. I would never ask this computer to do anything intensive. but it easily handles a HD youtube tab in the background while I'm doing web surfing. even loading gifs and the like while having Facebook open. it's a strong web computer. the specs don't allow for much else however. this should not be bought if intending to play games even lite ones. or doing more heavy photoshop or microsoft office apps. I must also note a nice contrasting screen. making colors pop and text easy to read. again supporting my feelings of this being a nice web computer. with a 500GB hard drive it allows downloads and installing programs that are not intensive. 4GB's ram allows you to buffer HD youtube videos and moderate multi tab experience"}

There's not much extra but the 4gb of ram and 500 gb hd are what we really needed.  It could use more USB ports and blue tooth.  However, we paid $250 each for these and really wanted something with good quality to carry around for cheap.  My wife kept the Winblows 8.1 and I dumped everything and put the newest Linux Mint and a backup of the newest puppy linux (puppy btw has issues with the mouse and wifi).  It's been good for what it is and well worth the money.  You can tell it's got some hallow space in the case but the plastic is not flimsy feeling.  The only cheap feeling part is the touchpad mouse.  It frankly sucks and feels cheap.  I use a USB wireless mouse anyway but it would be nice if the mouse was nicer.  So, if you want a basic decent computer to do day to day browsing and computing, it's great...don't expect extras though and don't expect it to compare with a MAC, especially for $250."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "I purchased this laptop in Janurary, and a month ago the mouse pad stopped working and two weeks later the whole laptop was dead.  Would not power up.  Since it should be under warranty, I contacted ASUS.  They issued a RMA and I shipped it (cost me $49 to ship) back to them.  I just recieved a rather threatening email from them telling me I had 48 hours to pay the referenced invoice in order for the laptop to be repaired.  It listed Motherboard, keyboard, cable and a number of other things as not being covered under warranty and they were charging me $210 to repair it.  So, with shipping and repairs, I would have paid $259.00 to repair a laptop I paid $249 for less just 7 months ago.  I've NEVER had a laptop or other PC Die of anything but old age.  This is ridiculous.  I will buy a Dell or Compaq again...never ASUS.  Not ever again.  A rating of ONE STAR is too much for this laptop.  (Not to mention some issues I had with slowness and wireless.....it is a DUD)."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "I bought this laptop (Asus calls it a notebook), because I needed a device that had USB ports so I could program remote controls in the field. The USB ports failed after 4 months. I called Asus support, who by the way are excellent, and tried about five different things including reinstalling the BOIS. Nothing worked so on my 3rd. call to them they suggested a total system reset and assured me that would fix the problem. It didn't. So now I guess I will be sending it back to get a replacement. Asus support is EXCELLENT. It's not their fault the computer is defective. I'm certain I will be able to get a new computer because when I purchased it through Amazon.com it came with a 1 year guarantee against fire, water, dropping, or any other mishap that might happen, plus it's still in warranty. One thing I hate about this computer other than Windows 8.1 is you have to hold down the function key and volume up/down to adjust the volume. Really? Two fingers to adjust the volume? Plus these keys are on opposite ends of the keyboard, a really poor design. The battery life seemed to shorten considerably since I purchased it. At first it lasted about 7 hours, 10.5 months later I only get about 3 hours out of it. All in all it's about what I expected from a $200 computer. If you just need a basic computer it's not bad."}

Then one day the CPU simply wouldn't start anymore, ASUS's customer support was terrible. I bought this computer in the US but am now in France, the US customer support told me to call France (where obviously they don't speak any English) where they basically told me to fill in some paperwork for them to come pick the computer up \"within a week\"!!! Then it will take them at the very least 2 more weeks to identify the problem, then fix the computer and then I'd have to pay for shipping to get the computer back... Note that the computer is still under warranty and that ASUS offered no replacement option... I even offered to go up to the tech center (over 5 hours away from where I am) to bring them the computer to save time and they refused \"because it's the procedure we have to follow\". Basically ASUS is an absolutely terrible company and I would not wish my worst enemy to ever have to deal with their customer support service.

Since I only wanted a laptop to connect to the internet when I am away from my main computer, I figured this would have plenty of power for surfing.  I have no desire to play games (not that I could with this laptop).  Setup was easy and it looked like it would be fine for my tasks.  However, shortly after the \"honeymoon\", within a few weeks, the computer began to act up.  It would not connect, youtube would cut out or the browser icon would just spin (Google).  I ended up shelving the laptop due to frustration and unreliability.  When windows 10 came out, I decided to try to upgrade.  I went through all the screens and updates and received errors telling me that Windows 10 was not uploadable with my version 8.1.  After finding a site that gave me a link to upload Windows 10 and bypass the updates, I was able after several hours of uploading to install Windows 10.  This happened an hour ago as I type (on my desktop).  So far, the internet seems to be working faster than it did with wifi.

Be careful what you are getting at discounted prices.  I have had a continuing issue with loss of Power.  I did not really start using this system until after January 1st (my existing laptop was still working up to that time), so I did not really run anything on it until February.  Since that time I have replaced the Motherboard 3 times.  There is no separate battery with this system -- it is integrated into the Motherboard (based on why my local computer support shop told me).  So if you are having a power problem, the easiest fix appears to be to just replace the Motherboard, which is fine if you are still under warranty, but if not, then........  I have heard nothing but good comments on other ASUS systems (larger memory, faster processor), but mine is definitely a lemon and ASUS refuses to give me any credit or a new unit to replace this one.  I suggest if you are looking at the A55, do your research and check on the Power problems with this unit"}

The repair work only has a 90 day warranty. I disputed with the company and requested that they honor the work done because it was the same malfunction as the first time.  They refused and wanted $200 to replace the motherboard for a second time.  I will not be repairing this product with such low confidence that it won't continue to break down.\n\nJuly 2015:\nMy son and my daughter received this model in December.  Both units have died within this month.  A computer repair place tells me that the motherboards are fried.  I've contacted the seller to request information if there is a factory warranty on these.  After reading these reviews I am expecting a disappointing answer.  This is an awful rip-off and has left me with two very disappointed kids who feel extremely ripped off.  Anyone researching for a computer purchase, I do NOT recommend this one."}

I was looking for something with a low price tag to use every now and then for internet and writing.  Functionally, this laptop will do that.  It's very light and doesn't get hot so it's comfortable to use in that regard. The keyboard and touchpad are not the most usable in the world though.  The pointer moves when you click the buttons on the touchpad and the buttons are hard to click.  The keys on the keyboard have space between them making it a little tougher to find the right keys with touch typing.  The whole top of the laptop vibrates just a wee bit when you press the keys, giving the whole top a bit of a flimsy feel.  The pointer moving when I click was so annoying within the first few minutes that I decided to sell it and get a different one."}

I definitely got what I paid for. Horrible laptop! This is the 4th laptop I have had in the span of about 8 years (and yes thats's about 1 every two years, I seem to have bad luck with laptops) but this by far was the worst luck yet. Not even one month after getting this laptop it just suddenly crashed and the only thing I was doing was installing Microsoft office. I was shocked because I had taken such good care of it and made sure I did not over work it. But boom right after it crashed I held down the power button to shut it off and then when I tried to turn it back on...nothing. I live on a small island so having to send this back after only ONE MONTH of use was not worth it. The shipping was going to cost more then the repair itself so I forked out the dough and gave it to a computer repair guy. When I went to pick up the laptop the guy asked me how long I had been using it and when I told him it was brand new he was shocked. He said the problem it had was the connection with the screen and some other mumbo jumbo I couldn't quite follow, but basically he said the laptop had problems that usually super old and over-used laptops usually have. So after getting it repaired the problems did not stop. Whenever I move the laptop the screen goes crazy! It just freezes up and starts getting all glitchy (sorry this is the best way I can describe it).. Nothing will work and I just end up having to press down on the power button, let it sit for a bit until it cools off. The only way I have figured out how to get it to stop doing this is if I just do not move the laptop at all, it's that sensitive! I really wanted to give this laptop the benefit of the doubt because I have owned another ASUS laptop previously and it was awesome (until it got stolen >.>') but this one has just given me one big headache. In the end as soon as I save up I am going to buy another laptop and this time I will make a better investment and buy better quality because again...you get what you paid for. Lesson learned the hard way. I did give this laptop a two star because it at least DOES works now so far and has not given me problems yet."}

It is so cheaply made, the control pad is hardly functional, and the computer, although having a faster processor and more RAM pales in comparison to my old Dell Windows 7 model. I plan to have my old Dell fixed and use it, no user passwords demanded, just start and use, so much more simple and far better designed compared to the junk sold today!\n\nI will have to admit one shortcoming on my part, I am up in age and HATE Windows 8, 8.1! There is a forced password to set this up, and if you are foolish, as I was, thinking this is just something to deal with getting it set up, and you forget the complex, lengthy password it demands you use, there is no way to have the machine update anything, as it does not matter if you are the only user, once you are not able to enter the administrator password, the computer becomes worthless! It will cost you time and more money than it is worth to have Microsoft remedy the problem, as there is no CD tray, which if available would be highly expensive; Microsoft also will not send you any code to delete the administrator account, or renew the password. You cannot even sell it for cents on the dollar, unless you want someone else having your personal information. After this sad and sorry review I am going to trash this machine and place it in the garbage.\n\nThese new computers, where one is forced to set up new email accounts and lengthy passwords to have access are fine if you are able to deal with all the details of modern technology; however, if you like the familiar, this format is not for you. It would be far better to find a new computer which uses Windows 7, or repair your old model.\n\nThis is also a very poor processor for something as complex as Windows 8, 8.1; if you want apps and icons, get a better CPU, and but a better brand. Asus is the bottom of the barrel in computers; do yourself a favor and buy a Dell, or HP, anything is going to be better than this brand!"}

This also happened with pendrives sometimes, I downloaded every single driver from the manufacturer's website looking for a solution so I could fully use my computer but it was a complete waste of my time because I didn't work out.\nIt was awfully slow at the internet connection, it was an eternal motion to get a complete download from a .zip 1,2 BG picture pack.\nAbout the apps: I barely used Microsoft Word because it didn't respond after pressing the \"open\" button, this happened with Office 2010. The default Office provided in the laptop is the newest one, 2013 version if I recall well, but it worked out perfectly.\nA month after I rebooted it to manufacturer's original settings, while I was watching a movie on it, it suddenly blacked out and never turned on again. That was a few weeks ago and I doesn't show any life signals, no battery light on while it is plugged to the walls outlets, no making sounds, no ventilating, no nothing. I needed those 250 dollars that I spent on this laptop, I don't have a laptop anymore, and I don't have money to buy another one. From my personal experience I can tell this is a piece of garbage. Do not buy if you appreciate your money and your patience."}

I originally purchased one for my mother and it was so nice that I got one for my wife as well. They are pretty basic in terms of features, but again, these are extremely affordable. The screen gets bright, the speakers are loud, keyboard is good, and the trackpad is great. That last bit is very important to me. Good trackpads are hard to find on PCs in general so I'm very happy that ASUS knows what they are doing. My personal machine is a higher end ASUS laptop and it has the best trackpad I've ever used besides a Mac. Very glad to see that the quality doesn't immediately drop off, even though the price does. Also worth mentioning is the charger. It's extremely small, almost like a phone charger, making it very portable. The one thing that I had to take a star off for is the optical drive. I understand it not coming with one, but having the slot with a cover over it is very confusing. It looks as though it has one but it does not. One review I read was very negative because of this. He felt the drive had no button and that he was sent a defective product, when in fact it does not have a drive at all. But I digress...This laptop is great for basic users or children. It's made well and very affordable.\n\nTL;DR\nIt's cheap, but not crappy. Buy it! You can always return later...But I won't be returning either of the 2 I bought."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "Totally engineered wrong. The power cable should be in the back. It's on the side and can easily be bumped and broken if you use this laptop on your lap. The USB ports are not very secure and wiggle around inside. The computer itself needed an update out of the box. Not that surprising but the update gets stuck in a loop. Like other reviews have also stated. I had to search the internet for a workaround, and update it manually to get past the loop. There is a memory leak somewhere and it eats up all the ram. This causes a delay when you type. 99% of the time when you start typing it will first display the second or third letter you've typed in a word before adding the first letter in after the other two are already inputted.  I wouldn't recommend this laptop. It's got some issues."}

No its not the best laptop out there, but For me, it was worth every penny.\n\nPros\n\n-Very easy to set up and get going.\n-Playing netflix and youtube is fast and i have no complaints in this section\n-The Laptop itself doesnt look cheap, very sturdy and slick looking.\n- Gaming, this is NOT a gaming machine, BUT that does not mean it can not play some older/ low requiring games. Games i have played ( Gmod, ran good on medium settings, Mount And Blade, really well, Total war Mediavel 2 demo, also ran very good on medium settings, and son to try out skyrim, just to see how well it will run. Minecraft will prob work fine on low-medium settings)\n\nCons\n-Windows 8, now i had never used windows 8 before this, and i can say i really prefer Windows 7.\n- On start the laptop crashed/froze, but has not done it since.\n-It has some bad days of being slow, but i can look past that.\n\nOverall\n\nIf your looking for a decently cheap laptop to watch videos or do some light gaming , or to browse the web,then this is a very good choice for the price.\nI would recommend it."}

By February, the laptop just stop working, I couldn't even turn it on, so I called the ASUS customer services, they paid the shipping to send it for a check up.\nI didn't liked what they told me after the first check up, they said that the mother board (which is the main thing) doesn't work anymore and they needed to replace it. Then they call me again (after 3 weeks of waiting) and they said that also the keyboard needed to be replaced as well. How a \"new\" laptop that was barely used needs to be almost rebuilt, and change so many parts. I'm not comfortable with my product, actually I'm not confident that the laptop with an occasional use can last a year!!"}

The nice, clean layout is a result of its operating system, not its actual hardware. I have dealt with more system crashes and slow reaction times with this thing within the past five months than I have had with a Dell in about 11 years! THE TWO-YEAR WARRANTY IS A MUST, because I've had to send it back to them TWICE for one functionality-barring defect or another, ranging from a full-on blackscreen to an OS seizure, each time returning to me with small cosmetic defects that they thought I wouldn't notice... I may have to send it back again, soon, because the touchpad has ceased functioning. Take it from me, the price isn't worth it! Just get a quality laptop. It's not worth the heartache."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "For me it only lasted 5 months before it officially broke and even then straight out of the box it had complications. Its wifi receptor is trash if your not standing next to wifi route you are not getting internet. I think your maximum space allowance would be about one wall away from it no more than two it will not work. It also has a visual bug where the screen would switch from tints of blue and normal without you being able to do anything about it. It is not a fast computer what so ever a highlight was it could run HD youtube videos which is nothing to brag about at all... you cant overclock the processor to make it any faster because it is what the computer would call it \"turbo\" which is suppose to mean its already overclocked for you the processor couldn't handle barley any games i think the only game i could 60 frames or whatever on where browser or 2d games the screen is barely connected to the base it would snap and make noises just because i was opening and closing it. Eventually nothing was apart but somehow the screen wasn't working at all while my computer part of the laptop would still run lights and all. The usb ports are really stupid sensitive as well if i tilted anything in their a little bit it would disconnect without warning. You would be better off buying and purposefully old laptop that cost this much than something trying to disguise it self as brand new. I tried bear with it because of pricing but the fact that it breaks so suddenly without warning is what upset me the most. Do not get this its a lets make a piece of s*** computer and make a quick buck and hope they buy a warranty so it will keep breaking kind of tech. and for gamers out here this is a message:IT CANT EVEN RUN MINECRAFT..."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "This was purchased as a gift.  Previously purchased the exact same laptop at a brick and mortar store.  When this arrived, gave it a once over to assure no damage, correct product, etc.  After the receiver of the gift began to set it up and use it we all discovered that it did not include a CD/DVD drive and had a partitioned hard drive.  Was definitely not what we were expecting.  If it were not for that I would give it 5 stars, as it is a great laptop. I love mine and especially love that it came with a CD/DVD drive and a non-partitioned hard drive. For slightly less of a price I might add.\n\nI guess maybe I should have paid more attention? But considering how I had previously purchased the exact same laptop at another store, I thought I knew exactly what I was purchasing.  Apparently not.  Obviously, those issues were not the end of the world and can be worked around.  However, I think it should be a lot more black and white that this laptop has those \"specs\" or lack thereof."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "Does a fine job, starts up fast and shuts down fast.  Needs a lot of updating and I am not that fond of the operating system.  I am writing this review on this computer.  It connects to the wifi easily in the restaurant where I am currently enjoying Italian food and wine while trying to write my book.  I had to get on Amazon and review this just to tell everyone that what you have heard about the keyboard is somewhat accurate.  It does not support overly fast typing speeds unless you are very careful and press hard. That being said it does improve your ability to push the keyboard buttons down as you get angry that you have so many typos.  I have had to correct this review twice so far were it has missed letters that  pressed too lightly.  The trackpad sometimes clicks in my text while I'm typing as well when I use the spacebar.  This could be avoided if the computer was lower than me and my hands were not on the laptop.  The battery life is good if you are not doing anything too intense.  It is sometimes hard to click with the trackpad as well.  I have played and enjoyed a few steam games on this computer, Postal 2 mainly, which is an old game but awesome.  I don't have virus protection because I use my Mac for browsing sites that could be dangerous and stick to what I know here.  I do use spybot s&d free and it has found various things to fix but takes a while.  I would have liked blutooth but bought a $10 kinivo transmitter and it works great.  Sound is as expected, pretty good but it's a laptop, what do you expect?  Not as much bass as a subwoofer because the laptop would shake.  I do like that it has a numerical keypad but they put one of the arrow keys where zero usually is so I get out of order sometimes.  I only paid $229 when it was on supersale here and have had it for six months with no issues.  It doesn't come with an installation disc like everything else in the world and I uninstalled most features of which I later needed but the serial key I retrieved for Windows did not work to download Windows Media Center which I no longer need but heck if I'm going to pay for Windows features!  If I were really concerned with keyboard functionality and the trackpad I would get an additional keyboard and mouse.  I do use a usb mouse for gaming.  Can't go wrong for the price and RAM, my primary reasons for buying.  I like it because I don't worry about it getting hurt (I do everything in the cloud) or stolen.  It is the closest I could get to a good but inexpensive laptop that is basically disposable if need be.  Like if I have it in a hotel room while I am on a mission and the enemy gets the upper hand and I must leave in haste, then I can burn the harddrive remotely.  Yes the camera is lame and not very good quality, don't buy it for that, just get a usb hd camera for $50.  One thing to love over a mac is the extra buttons: home, pgup, pgdown, end, delete, prt sc.  These features are invaluable to me and I have always been disappointed in macs because of them even with the shortcuts that they provide for prints screen functions."}

No, it doesn't have the quality of a MacBook Air, - neither the build, keyboard or trackpad are as solid or \"responsive\" but again - for the price it's hard to complain. Same goes for the screen, though it does a \"fine\" job.\n\nWhat it does have is a bevy of ports, including both HDMI, VGA, and USB 3.0.\n\nFor a starter/basic laptop with a fully licensed copy of Windows 8.1, you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal, and thus it receives the highest recommendation.\n\n5 stars out of 5."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "Good, basic laptop. Works perfectly well in spite of being the old version, at least enough for my needs, email, casual video watching, etc. Speakers aren't the greatest, but you could add speakers, I suppose. This was a replacement for an ancient desktop, otherwise I probably would have gotten a smaller size. Like any laptop it gets a little warm on your lap, but a small pad takes care of that and it's more comfortable on my lap that way anyhow. It's large enough that I can use it as a desktop with a wireless mouse and keyboard. Takes a while to get used to the touchpad if, like me, you've never used one. Sometimes it seems too sensitive, sometimes not sensitive enough, but as I'm not used a touchpad it could just be me. Sort of wished I'd gotten one with an optical drive, but I can always get a USB one. I'll probably get a USB hub--only one USB2 and one USB3.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "I bought this for my daughter's 6th birthday present, and so far, it's perfect for that purpose.  She wanted a computer for three things: Minecraft, YouTube and Netflix.  And while this computer might move a little slow getting to any of these programs, once something is running, I haven't heard her complain once.\n\nWindows 8.1 - this took a bit of getting used to while I was setting the computer up for her (parental controls and all that), but I'm what they call \"old skool\" and \"old\" and \"possibly a little slow upstairs, if you catch my meaning\" ... but my daughter took to the OS pretty easily.  It forces you to have a sign-in password, but I set up one of those picture background thingies (technical term) that you click a pattern onto, and she has no problem with that.  From there, she's pretty good at moving between the new app-centric home screen Microsoft is trying to sell phones and tablets with, and the regular, comfortable \"Windows 7-ish\" home screen that I love.  Since she only has a few programs and apps she uses, she doesn't get lost in the system, and she's not yet at that wonderfully curious stage where I have to hope she doesn't somehow delete System32.\n\nBrowser - Google runs my life (and I'm comfortable with that), and I'm passing that down to her.  She uses Chrome (\"OMG all muh RAMs, tho!!!\"), and this computer handles it well enough.  She only uses it for heavily censored YouTube viewing and a couple of other kid-friendly sites.  Also, she has her own section on my Netflix account, and there hasn't been any trouble with streaming, so the wifi apparently works well enough.\n\nGaming - She's Minecraft obsessed (going to wait a little while before we bring GTA into the mix ... she gets in enough trouble at school) and since I dabble in it, I was more than happy to let her curiosity in the game grow.  This computer handles the game really well (which I'm really impressed with), which is no small feat considering it tends to take a lot of power to run.  It certainly doesn't load as fast as my PC, but it's also not far behind.  She has yet to complain about running out of world while she's exploring.  It also handles playing over the server I set up on my PC through the wifi really well, so again, no complaints there.\n\nHardware - She uses both the touchpad and a wireless mouse, depending on what she's doing with the PC, and I'm also thinking I'll get her a wireless keyboard at some point, since she likes to button-mash a little too enthusiastically, but for now, everything seems to be in good working order.  She's no typist yet (since she's still learning to read), but one of the reasons I got her the computer was to get her ready for the real world by letting her learn the keyboard at an early age.  She certainly has WASD down well enough, but I'm sure the rest will catch on as I work with her on it.\n\nOverheating has yet to be an issue, as well.\n\nSo, as the title says, I've been pretty darned happy about this little investment.  I'm sure there are better computers for kids out there, but for the price, and knowing how clumsy my kid is (genetics), I have yet to be unhappy with this purchase."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "My first impression after I bought this laptop is that it was rather cheaply made. The keyboard and mouse were very sub-standard. It was literally clunky and hard to type on. Plus, I was so disgusted that it did not have an SD slot, so I couldn't even easily download the pictures off of my camera. It also doesn't have a DVD slot, which I knew ahead of time, but still think is a negative. Nevertheless, I figured I'd keep it anyway because I bought it so cheap here on Amazon. Well, 2 months after receiving it, it suddenly just stopped charging when I would plug it in. No warning, no explanation. I didn't damage it or anything like that... it was just some weird development after working fine for 2 months. I figured I just had ended up with a lemon. So, I sent it back to Amazon and got a replacement. That one didn't even last 2 DAYS and started exhibiting the exact same problem. I'm like, what's up with that???? How could I end up with 2 lemons with the exact same problem and nobody else on Amazon is talking about it being a problem for them? WEIRD! Anyway, there was no way in the world I was going to pay over $200 for a laptop that would not charge it's battery, so I sent it back to Amazon and got my money back. I'm so thankful that Amazon did not harass me at all about the 2 returns I did. It was a smooth process and in the end, I didn't lose anything but a little bit of time and aggravation. At least now I can use my experience to warn you to just steer clear of this sorry excuse of a laptop. I ended up foregoing a cheap laptop altogether and got a beautiful Dell Inspiron 17 from Dell.com and am totally in love with it."}

The keyboard is one of the best features with normal arrow keys and a number pad instead of the under size keys some laptops have. I can type comfortably on it for hours.\n\nThe touchpad works well and is fairly large. So large sometimes the touch gestures don't work because my left hand is resting on the pad without me realizing it. Other than that the gestures work perfect almost every time.\n\nThe USB 3 port is very fast. I copied about 40 gigs of music from my external in the time it took to make a cup of coffee. So that is functional. But it also has a USB 2 port. The ports are color coded.\n\nThe screen is normal with good color with no dead pixels or flickering so far.\n\nThe speakers work pretty well during normal usuage but they don't have too much bass (they do have some). Also, they can cut out or lag if the CPU is under heavy load (90%+) such as if your virus scanner is active.\n\nAlso the speakers do not seem to do well with the Flash Plugin for Firefox for that very reason. It tends to hog the CPU. This is a know problem with Flash.\n\nHowever the Flash built into Chrome seems to run smoother. So, even though I'm a FF guy this computer seems much happier with Chrome instead.\n\nThe CPU is obviously underpowered and so is the 3D. You don't want this computer if you plan on playing lots of games. But it wasn't designed for that. Also for whatever reason the 3D will sometimes lag if Windows update/matience is running. But for normal computer usuage it works fine.\n\nThe battery lasts beteewn 4-5 hours. Sometimes less. Maybe more if you're just browsing and not watching videos.\n\nThe only bad thing is the battery is not easily replaceable apparently. It has no release lever and is built in. Apparently there is still a way to get to it though."}

I spend a lot of time switching back and forth to the desktop view. I can find no redeeming value to the app view on Windows 8.\n\nProcessing power is limited making streaming videos jump and stutter at times.\n\nIt powers up fairly quickly and is good for general day to day web-browsing.

After I installed Linux my missing 200 gbs showed up, and I really don't know what was up with that. I attached a screenshot of the specs. The processor is an Intel Celeron N2830, which does not state \"dual core\" anywhere I can find in the system information, but if you go on the Celeron website it says that processor model is a dual. Therefore none of the product information in the listing is incorrect, as I initially believed it to be.\n- My true complaint with this laptop, the reason for the knocked-off star, is the keyboard. Its fully sized, which was important to me, but the keys just don't feel great under-hand. A few days in the keyboard bulged up slightly and popped up off it's case. I was able to click it back down into place but the plastic is still slightly warped in the center of the keyboard. Typing is unaffected by this bulge, but it worries me and simply should not have happened so early on, if at all.\n\nUEFI/BIOS issue\nSecure boot has to be disabled before it will allow you to boot from a live USB. Here's how I did it.\n1. Create or procure USB install of Linux because this computer has no disc drive. Plug it into the computer when you're ready to go.\n2. Open PC Settings -> Update & Recovery -> Recovery ->Advanced Setup -> \"Restart Now\" (Will not restart, but trigger a popup) -> Troubleshoot -> Advanced Options -> UEFI Firmware Settings -> Restart (Actually Restarts).\n3. In the UEFI/Boot menu tab over to \"Security\" -> Select \"Secure Boot Management\" -> Toggle to \"Disable\" -> Save and Exit (There's a key command for Save/Exit listed on the right side of the screen.)\n4. Computer will boot up as normal. Go back into PC Settings. -> Update & Recovery -> Recovery -> Advanced Setup -> \"Restart Now\" -> Use a Device -> UEFI \"Your Linux USB Name\" -> Start Linux. (Be aware that if you have other USB stuff plugged in, like a mouse or printer, that will show up under USB devices. Boot from the one you're sure is your Linux install.)\n5. You should now be in a test-run Linux environment. There's an install on the desktop.\n\nWindows 8.1 was way too over-encumbered for this humble laptop. It felt sluggish and got increasingly less responsive even in the short time I used it. I Installed Linux mint 17 cinnamon and had no compatibility issues. The laptop runs significantly faster with Linux than it does with Windows.  I did not notice a change in battery life, as others have commented on. Overall I'm pretty pleased."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "UPDATE (4/2015) - Customer service: Had to do 2 separate online chats along with the support phone call as the first person (phone) didn't create an RMA like he was supposed to, the second couldn't find the service ticket and since it was on a weekend had nobody to contact. Third person (via online chat) got it right. The online chat worked great and I found Customer Support easy to reach. After returning the AC adapter (at my cost) it took about 3 weeks to get the replacement. Luckily I had a travel adapter that worked (not all adapters that \"fit\" will work, check the amp output) so I wasn't out of business waiting on the replacement.\nApart from that the laptop continues to perform great.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an exceptional value. I purchased this for my wife at the same time as components to rebuild my desktop (ASUS motherboard, which is my go-to). Is this as fast as an 8 core CPU with 16GB of DRAM? No. But it does start up (and shut down) remarkably fast for a laptop without a SSD drive. Performance is very acceptable for all our usual activities - browser (email, shopping on Amazon, getting the news,...), YouTube/NetFlix and other assorted videos (just finished the new House of Cards series), even MS Office. I haven't tried Steam games, or any real games for that matter, as I use my desktop for that and my wife doesn't play those. Running Windows 8.1, Norton security suite, some of the misc ASUS utilities and it's just great. No real bloatware on here like with some of the other companies. Only problem has been the AC Adapter - it went bad and wouldn't charge the laptop. That got sent back under warranty (we had to pay the shipping) and we're waiting on the replacement. Did the whole warranty claim via online chat. Another bonus - Best Buy services ASUS (although for whatever reason cannot replace the AC Adapter :-/ ) so you have a local shop to bring it to if necessary."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "I purchased this laptop as I needed just a simple, basic, Windows-based laptop to replace my old ASUS netbook.  The specs listed in the description led me to believe that this laptop would fit the bill, even if it did come with Windows 8.1 (I prefer Windows 7).  I've had this laptop for just under a week as of this writing and overall I'm satisfied.\n\nThere are some gripes, though. I'm disappointed in the number of USB ports. It could have used at least one more.  More often than not, I use an external mouse (trackball style) and that means that I only have one USB port to use for flash drives OR to power the cooling pad I have.  Not a huge issue, but one of those \"gee, that sucks\" kind of things.  Loss of one star.\n\nThis laptop also lacks status indicator lights for the wireless card, HDD activity, CAPS and NUM lock.  Why those were left out of this model is beyond me.  CAPS and NUM lock indicator lights are not a real big issue, but it's very helpful to see when (or if) the computer is accessing the HDD and if the wireless card is off.  These two items were present on my 2008 vintage ASUS netbook.  The ONLY status lights are for Power and Battery Status.  Loss of another star.\n\nThe keyboard is well laid out and I find typing on it to be very easy without much adaptation from a standard desktop version.  I do notice a slight lag while typing and there seems to be a tendency to drop a character when typing the same letter twice (as in \"tt\" in letter).  This may be a Windows setting that needs tweaking a little bit.\n\nI cannot comment on how this laptop handles Windows 8.1.  I dislike that OS very much and within an hour of unboxing I was installing Windows 7 (64-Bit).  This laptop does NOT include an optical drive, as I expected.  I already had a USB optical drive on hand, though.  If you're like me and want to install Windows 7, make sure you download the appropriate drivers from the ASUS support site.  Windows 7 does NOT include the needed drivers natively.  Other than that, Windows 7 runs really well on this machine.\n\nThe computer is really light.  It seems to weigh almost as much as my old netbook despite being much larger.  The sound from the speakers is really good.  If you want fantastic sound, you'll have to attach some powered external speakers, of which there is plenty of choices out on the market.  Unless you are a rabid audiophile, you'll likely be pleased with the stock speakers on this machine.  I haven't had any problems using headphone/earbuds with this laptop.\n\nBottom line: if you don't need a computer to do high end graphics, photo/video editing, and/or gaming, this laptop shouldn't disappoint.  This machine is more than capable for the basics of modern life.  Most of my DVD collection has been converted to MP4s I've watched several movies without any performance issues.  Keep in mind that this laptop has a glossy screen, so reflection from your surrounding environment may be an issue in some lighting conditions.  For this reason, I prefer a matte-style screen."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "I am quite knowledgeable of all things tech, and was in the market for a new laptop. My budget these days isn't great so I had to buy a laptop that was both affordable and solid. In this day and age, since technology is rapidly changing and getting better, it's not far-fetched to really have something inexpensive AND dependable. You get what you pay for, but there are always exceptions. After reading the reviews here on Amazon and on other outside sources, I ended up choosing this Asus laptop. First off, it just feels cheap: very lightweight and plastic. Still, that in and of itself doesn't mean it won't perform very very well. The speed of this thing is pretty good. The audio is a lot better than other laptops I've had/used. The graphics look stellar. But right out of the box the screen began to flicker here and there...go from bright to not-s-bright, then darker, than back again to bright. It would happen a few times a day. Then after about a week it would flicker then completely go black. I had to close the laptop and re-open it to get it on again. This now happens about once or twice a day. I tried changing the refresh rate, but it doesn't give me the option to change it to anything other than the preset setting. I then tried to update the graphics driver, but then it would tell me that I didn't have the minimum requirements on my computer to update it. Huh!? I wrote ASUS customer assistance and explained the issue, did everything they asked, and it did not help (uninstall the driver, re-install). Now I'm stuck with the non-Intel/generic graphics driver because nothing else works (and I now cannot even adjust the screen brightness, and it's stuck on very bright!!). I've only had this laptop for a month. (As I write this the screen goes black then back on...so obviously it isn't the driver...hardware issues...great). This is very disappointing. I depend on my laptop for my livelihood. I guess you really do get what you pay for. I do not think I will ever purchase an ASUS product again."}

Thusfar, my MacBook hasn't worked since the incident. So, whilst browsing reddit I viewed some hilarious Q&A's about this laptop and confirmed if they were legitimate by finding the laptop on Amazon. Accidentally, I had purchased it. When it arrived, I just opened it and set it up, it was already here so why not, right?\n\nThe reason why I told you my story about my MacBook, which is true, is because I'd like to compare an apple to an orange, or asus.. maybe, rather, anus. At first I had been hit by a sudden urge to grab my VersaMax and put holes in this thing, this emotion was triggered by the fact that it took about 30 minutes to set up because of the need to have a Microsoft account and slow internet because I live on a farm. Whatever, got it done and it was ready to use.. somewhat. I hadn't used a windows OS since Vista.. which was why I changed over to OS X. Anyway, the damned tile thing they used instead of a start menu shows up, and I about lost it again, this time standing on the back porch ready to chuck this thing at a tree. But, I calmed down, patiently navigated and removed all of the junk that they preload on these new computers, and downloaded Firefox and iTunes. Since then, I noticed that it uses DDR3 RAM, my MacBook did too, and it had 8gb, ie 2x4gb cards.. tore this one apart and it uses a single 4gb card.. waste of 15 minutes.\n\nNot impressed with the screen, not impressed with the speaker, the keyboard layout sucks and doesn't have background illumination.\n\nThe fact that an inoperable MacBook Pro from 2010 still outperforms a brand new, running, sleek looking yet disappointing laptop just brings me to tears. I'll keep this thing just to have an extra device to do something with, it has plenty of space, but I wouldn't recommend this thing to anybody, even at a very low price."}

I have a good virus protection and adblocker on it. It has no virus. I have had the laptop for THREE days and it freezes, randomly closes programs, when you close the top and open it again it closes whatever i was doing or most of the time, stays a black screen when I open it up again and I have to restart it all the time. It's a lazy turd and I don't know what Im doing wrong!! Smaller side note: the key board is kind of clunky and loud so if you like quiet typing, reconsider. I don't know if I'm just unlucky with laptops but man. So disappointed."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "This notebook computer from ASUS does not have good features or performance. The screen is just barely adequate. The processor is slow. The fit and finish is poor. It has a cheap, plastic look and feel. And, annoyingly, Asus neglected to include indicators for NUM LOCK and CAPS LOCK which is inexcusable. Spend a little more money and avoid this product... Why? Read on.\n\nI had to send it in for service after only one month of light use... just barely too late to return it to Amazon, which I would do if I could.\n\nThe customer service at ASUS is, really, horrible. A train wreck. Total disaster. I sent the computer into ASUS service with an RMA and they sent it back DOA. It wouldn't even turn on! And this just back from factory service? Unbelievable.\n\nThe packaging they sent it back in was like some kind of bad joke -- it was completely inadequate to protect the computer. The packaging they sent it back in was probably the reason it was DOA. Now I don't know what to do.\n\nI have to send it back to ASUS again and they won't even arrange for a FEDEX pickup -- I have to box it up and drive in to a FEDEX shipping center! Really? Fedex will pick it up if ASUS asks them to, but ASUS won't even ask them to pick it up.\n\nASUS is perhaps the worst customer service I've ever encountered. They don't give a crap about retail customers like me. They've totally lost me forever because of their treatment of me on this order.\n\nIf you're reading this review in anticipation of purchasing something from ASUS, I'd have second thoughts."}

Then, he turned it on 2 days ago and several of the keys would not work (s,3,5,6,7,0,`,=,del). He was upset when he found out that some of the keys would not work.  It's hard to log on when one of the keys you need does not work!  It is past the return period to return to Amazon so it looks like we will have to send the computer in for repair. It seems to me that after producing millions of keyboards... a keyboard issue would be the last of anyone's worries.  But, here we are.  The only choice we have at this point is to send the computer in to Asus for repair.  Very disappointed!"}

There was also some arcade software on it that couldn't be uninstalled and caused a popup every 30 seconds. I bought this new so I don't understand why this stuff is on here. The backspace key is also pushed in and barely functions. I decided right from the get go to give up on this windows 8 and was gonna format the hard drive and install windows 7. The configuration was weird and it took me forever and a BIOS update to finally get rid of windows 8.

The plastic is so thin and poorly put together That the case flexes when you press a key. They keyboard itself is just terrible to type on, the exception being the 10 key -which is very handy. Nothing about this notebook shouts quality. It has a 500GB hard drive but a chunk of that is bloated OS. The drive is split into two volumes so don't freak out if u only see 165GB when you power up. The other 250 is on D (Data) drive. What I will say about this netbook is out of the box, its fast. Opens apps easily and connecting to net is a snap. NOT a good choice for playing steam games, the dual core just can't handle it.  The speakers are the WORST I have ever heard (almost like a very cheap external speaker) and don't do justice to the sound chip. You are definitely going to want to use headphones with this notebook. For a simple notebook to write code or create documents, this will do. Any graphic work or games -Not a good choice."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "First let me just state that I enjoy having asus products, especially their motherboards. They're very well built. Their laptops are a good quality build as well. Now onto this product.\n\nI mainly purchased this product for school as my previous one had finally given up on me and being a computer science major I mainly just write codes so I thought to myself that I didn't really need a powerful laptop for what I was going to be doing with the occasional Netflix. So I quickly hopped into amazon and started searching for a replacement. Seeing as how the item was from asus I decided to check the specs and decided that it would fit my needs and it did seem like a great deal with it being just under $300.\n\nUpon arrival the item look sleeked and light weight at that which made it much more ideal. Dealing with the set up was nothing out of the ordinary but it isn't fast as to be expected with only 4 gigs of ram with a HDD.\n\nRight after dealing with the set up, I noticed that McAfee was installed on the product along with other add on programs that made the item run even slower. The connection drops quite often which practically makes the WiFi card useless. So trying to update the system was unbearably slow until I just gave up and decided to use the Ethernet port. The programs run slowly even just opening a web browser takes at lest 10 seconds and another 10 seconds to search once you start searching.\n\nThe touch pad itself is quite a hassle to handle. Most of the time it randomly opens the quick bar menu on the right hand side as I try to scroll down a page or it doesn't detect that my fingers are not on there anymore and it keeps scrolling through. Which is very frustrating having to go back through every page on a PDF file. Half the time I had to use the arrow keys just so I could avoid dealing with the touch pad. The keyboard itself is no picnic either. It is somewhat unresponsive especially when typing fast.\n\nI thought I just needed to get used to this laptop and once every update was done it would respond accordingly and the speed would become better but unfortunately it never worked out.\n\nSo if you are looking for a budget laptop and you're one who doesn't mind having to wait for a few seconds to open up a folder or a web browser then this would be the laptop for you otherwise don' hesitate to spend an extra hundred or two for a faster processor and ram."}

I want to go a little lower, with 2, but that's a 'I don't like it', and it's not quite that bad.\n\nThe Pros...\nThe cost. The very low price is almost a steal. Now with the low cost, you are going to lose several important benefits.\nWeight. Super light.\nReasonable speed. No, I doubt you will be able to run Photoshop or other intensive programs.\nPlenty of ports. Well, not plenty. But they are all there. You have your Ethernet, VGA, HDMI, and 2 USB ports (only one each for 2.0 &3.0).\n\nThe Cons...\nNO RE-MOVEABLE BATTERY. WTF? Really?\nNO CD/DVD drive. Meh. I'll live. Tech is going to a download-only trend anyways... But sorta scares me to see how to fix thing when the OS fails\nNO access for anything. Memory, battery. You name it, it's locked down (which can be good).\nWindows 8.1 with Bing. Not necessarily a bad thing. Keeps the price of the laptop down. It doesn't shove Bing down your throat. You can use other search stuff on you PC. Search \"Windows 8.1 with Bing\" and HowToGeek explains it nicely.\nCheap plastic feel, but it works nicely.\nPower supply. I am really concerned about it. It is tiny. No ground on it too. But they are the engineers.\nNo way to upgrade anything."}

I just expect that when I buy a new computer that it works for basic things like Facebook, email and poking around on the internet.  This computer doesn't do that.  When connecting to the internet it bogs down (I have installed 3 programs; Chrome, Open Office and Thunderbird) and locks up.  I have to restart the thing 3x a day.  I looked at the processes running and they mostly seem to be Windows, only one program, Chrome, running and it takes forever.  I have a Windows phone and have always used Windows, but this computer seems to hate it.  Every Windows update requires a full system refresh, which means you lose pretty much everything.  It hates my wireless, half the time it connects the other half it doesn't.\n\nIt does bring up programs pretty fast and Open Office does work well on it from the little I have used it.\n\nOverall, I really do not like it and wish I had spent more and gone with something else.  I just thought that with the little I do that this could have, should have, done the job."}

The touch pad is worthless (you cannot click the far corners) you have to click in the middle on either the left or right half the of the touch pad (or use an external mouse). The screen viewing angle reminds me of a security screen where you have to be directly perpendicular to the screen to view the image. The screen bezel seems extremely flimsy, you have to hold the base down and \"pry\" the thing open at the center to avoid cracking the screen. I feel this machine gives ASUS a bad name, starting the refund process to Amazon now. If you decide to purchase please note you have been warned.

Details\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L49X8E6/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img\n\nIn Stock.\nShips from and sold by Amazon.com. Gift-wrap available.\nWant it Saturday, Feb. 14? Order within 9 hrs 12 mins and choose Two-Day Shipping at checkout.\n\nFirst, let me start by saying this Asus Laptop may very well be the best buy out there for the money. Now, reasons? First, it comes with a dual core Intel Processor. It has a 500gb Hard Drive, and 4GB of ram. Now, set up is very simple, even if you have never used window 8.1 before, which is another factor. You don't want a laptop with just windows 8, be sure it has the upgraded 8.1 version installed. That has eliminated the nagging little issues that windows 8 originally had. When you first turn the Asus on, it will ask you to verify your Microsoft email account, meaning Hotmail, Outlook, Msn. I would suggest opening up one of these before ordering the laptop, it will just save you time prior. Then, after a few quick clicks to accept the system setting itself up, you are good to go. Honestly, this should take about 15 minutes or so. Now, remember, it will quickly identify your wifi connection, and establish the connection for you. Once that is done, you are ready to go. Don't be intimidated by the small window panels you see on your screen, they are nothing more than options to select, to move around on the laptop.. It comes with McAfee Virus and Internet protection, which is good for 30 days, then you can decide to either keep it, or simply use any other program. I strongly suggest McAfee or Norton on this laptop. Now, it does not come with a DVD/cd Rom Drive, so if that is a major factor for you, then there is another Asus model, about $15.00 more that does include the optical drive. Most people find very little use for it these days, since almost everything can simply be downloaded these days anyway. The screen is 15.6\", bright clear. The sound is also very nice from this laptop. It has a full size keyboard, 2 USB Ports, one is a 2.0 and one is a 3.0, which is for faster performance."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "This is an excellent entry level laptop for people that don't need a super powerful machine. I have a desktop computer set up in my home office, but needed something that I could take with me on the go, use while sitting on the couch or in the bedroom. I needed a laptop that would be powerful enough for me to do my work away from the office, but at the same time something cheap. This laptop fits both of those criteria.\n\nAs far as laptop itself, it's keyboard does seem kinda flimsy (although this is not a problem for typing purposes, it's purely just a \"feel\"). The case itself seems to be made of a cheaper plastic, which cuts down on the weight of the unit quite a bit I'm sure (the laptop itself is very light).\n\nThis is a great laptop for the price, and I would highly recommend it for anyone needing a basic entry level laptop."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "I am very disappointed with this purchase and the money I would spend to send it back is not worth it! I had heard a lot of good things about ASUS and this particular laptop had a \"Best Seller\" sticker added so I figured that it was a good laptop for the money. Of course with the price I wasn't expecting anything fancy but I did expect some type of ...something. I guess I got what I was looking for.\nFirst of all, once I took it out of the box (it was packaged nicely by the way), I was immediately disappointed as it seemed flimsy to the touch and look. I started it up and had no problems but I am not a computer expert. There are no stickers identifying key components of the laptop such as memory size, hard drive size etc. which I initially found to be suspicious! When I finally found my way into the settings, my laptop is listing two drives:one at 186GB labelled \"OS\" and the other at 258GB labelled \"Data.\" I have absolutely no idea what that means but any files saved went to the drive labelled OS and I cannot seem to get anything into the \"DATA\" drive. So now I am stuck because this laptop was to replace my other and I can't even load my iTunes library because they are telling me my disk is full and this is the only thing I have tried to load so far.\nNo I didn't contact ASUS. I don't think they can help me and maybe this is irresponsible of me but I am frustrated and very disappointed and even though this may be an isolated incident or even one of small significance (maybe there are supposed to be these two drives with this type of laptop without an optical drive), as a first time purchaser of ASUS, I am not impressed."}

Really good bang for your buck here.\nNice screen. OK speakers.\nVery light weight, even for a laptop of it's size.\n\nCons:\nMicrosoft (depending on who you are)\nThe whole laptop is plastic (again depending on who you are)\nMy only REAL complaints about this laptop is the keyboard and the built-in mousepad. ASUS really skimped on the keyboard and mousepad to keep costs low. They work, but the keys have to be pressed with a purpose, and because of it's all plastic nature, it sounds like garbage when typing on it at any respectable speed.\nThe mousepad works better than the keyboard, but again, at times, it has to be used with a purpose. The buttons are part of the pad, and don't have touch delete on them, so you cannot scroll, point, zoom, etc with your finger resting on the mousepad buttons.\n\nThis laptop is super cheap, looks super cheap, and feels super cheap, but for the money, is really hard to beat (brand new in box).\nMy uses: School. Web browsing, document editing, programming, Mathematica, Youtube, etc. I haven't used it for anything intense like gaming and don't plan to. If you buy this computer to play Starcraft 2, then you deserve to deal with the problems that are sure to come.\n\nThe only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of how insanely cheap it looks and feels (mainly the keyboard). Also a little irritated about the no MS Office license, because a brand new $200 laptop with Windows 8.1 isn't going to be popular in the student market, right? [sarcasm]"}

It just rapidly connects and disconnects, several times a second. This is actually more irritating than if it did nothing at all.\n\nI've thought a lot about whether it's fair to factor in the OS in this review. After all, the people at ASUS didn't design Windows 8.1, and they may not have even had much choice in whether or not it got used in this model. I don't know. I do know that Windows 8.1 is a terrible OS for a non-touch laptop PC, even when it's used in its \"desktop\" mode. I don't know who made that final decision to ship this PC with Windows 8.1, but that was a bad decision, and I hope that person realizes that he or she has made the world a worse place.\n\nIn summary, I am mildly dissatisfied.

I added a wireless mini mouse by logitech... which cuts down on the problem of the screen magnifying itself as I use the touch pad. And I just upgraded to Windows 10  which is WAAAAAAAY more user-friendly than Windows 8... and the computer seems like it is working even faster than when it was new (it had begun to slow way down with the Windows 8). So you could say I am \"re-inlove\" with it!\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................\nI read a lot of reviews before purchasing this computer and I agree with most of them now that I have been enjoying it for a few weeks. Asus has provided a fabulous laptop for the money.\n\nI have to confess that my + response is partly what my mother and her peers used to call \"damning with faint praise\" since I am transitioning from a lemon of a little 're-furbed\" Asus Netbook... after several years of thinking netbooks were \"the bees knees.\" The little lemon had audio problems and also had the text hopping all over the page as I typed.. so you can see how a computer that allows me to just type this review and not stop to re-do things ever word or so... AND that has working audio that is loud enuf for me to watch a YouTube video without headphones... would have me grinning with relief.\n\nThe big improvement for me is that it has 4 gb ram not the 2 of the netbook.. and seems to have a powerful wireless connection... so everything works speedily and I can watch any streaming item with no pauses or hiccups. AND on the 15.6\" screen that seems theatre-sized compared to the 10\"ers I have used for years.\n\nThe full-sized keyboard will be a great thing for most folks... for me I loved the smaller netbook one... but have adjusted by now.. and the keyboard is solid and responsive without seeming too squishy... in fact the whole computer looks and feels solid ... of quality... despite it's surprisingly light weight.\n\nSo far I really have only one complaint... one noted by others. The touchpad has no \"left right buttons\" at the bottom and swipes on the main area of it expand the screen automatically. So it is very easy to \"grow\" the display to 400-500% in an instant by mistake.  I am gradually learning to overcome this by being sure to have my right thumb in the very  bottom corner .. the area that functions as the right button... in which case I'm not moving my right digit along with my left on the pad and expanding the screen size. AND I am getting automatic at clicking on the browser and reducing the size when I goof up. It is an annoying design flaw, however that I hope Asus fixes.\n\nOne flaw... for the price and the quality of all the rest.. I am willing to put up with it and still say I am grateful and delighted to have this computer that was within my price range.\n\nBasically... everything works easily and speedily with this computer"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "I bought this computer because my old one was destroyed in the middle of the semester and I could not be without a computer.  I went to a local branch of a chain store and spoke to a self-proclaimed geek in a blue shirt who highly recommended this computer.  My budget would have afforded a little more money, but I was told this computer was perfect.  It worked really well, for the price.  The processor was fast enough to handle all of my schoolwork, watch videos, and all of the random things that I need in a normal day.  I was happy, because I could not believe I had gotten such a good computer at such a great price ($249.00).  That lasted less than two months.  Then, the battery stopped charging.  I contacted those of the blue shirts, but it was too late.  I needed to contact ASUS.  So, I did.\n\nASUS responded through a person whose syntax in the email led me to believe that they did not understand English very well.  When I responded to the email, I received the same exact one back.  This went on for a couple of weeks, and I could not get anyone on a phone who could help me.  I kept being sent to the email system.  I finally found out that I could, indeed, have the battery replaced.  Apparently, the batteries that ASUS chooses to use have many problems, and for this reason they offer an extended warranty on the battery.  The turnaround time was anywhere between two and eight weeks, but it might take longer if they had a heavy volume.  I also needed to provide my credit card information before I shipped the computer to them, in case there were any other issues or problems that needed repair or in case they believed the faulty battery to be my fault.  They would pre-authorize the amount of a new computer, and promise not to charge me any more than that to make repairs.  There were other problems, but you should know enough by now not to expect any personalized or individual customer service.  However, if you wish to pay them for repairing a faulty product that they knew was faulty when it was sold, they will eventually pay attention to you.\n\nThe computer still works, as long as one does not wish to move it from the desk, where it must stay plugged in at all times.  It has a good screen, and I'm still happy with the performance, if the battery worked.  I would be happy if they even offered it with a replaceable battery, so that I could buy a new battery and just replace it myself.  If I wanted a desktop computer to check emails and such, I suppose it would work just fine.  However, I bought a laptop because portability is important to me.  I ended up having to replace it with another cheap computer, because I'd blown almost half my computer budget on this one.\n\nI would not recommend this computer, because you are basically rolling the dice with the batteries ASUS uses.  If their customer service were any good at all, I would say take the chance.  While it worked, I was happy with it.  But, if you get one with a bad battery you cannot replace it yourself and they do not understand that customer service is supposed to help customers with problems.  There are other good options for budget laptops:  find one from a different company."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "My parents always warned me, saying \"You get what you pay for.\"  They were absolutely correct, and this is exception.\n\nThe X551MA is a decent computer if all you want to do is listen to music, stream online video (internet connection pending), and MAYBE talk on skype or IM.  Just don't expect to be able to do all of these things at once.\n\nPossibly the biggest hinderance this laptop has is its Operating System, Windows 8.1.  Sure, it's an improvement over Windows 8, but I was expecting my first Windows 8.1 experience to be a bit better than this was.  Perhaps when Win 10 hits it will speed up a bit, as I hope the OS will be less dependent on processor speed and RAM usage.  High hopes for the future I suppose.\n\nI can't really find anyting \"nice\" to say about this laptop, as it does not have a CD drive (which is mentioned in the product description, so I'm not giving a bad rating based on that), has a bit of a \"fuzzy\" camera built-in along side some equally-as-bad microphones.  The screen is bright and reproduces colors nicely, but I often find it hard to make out the edges of barriers inside the web pages and Apps I use.  Perhaps my opacity is to high/low for the brightness, but that's not too big of a deal to me.  The keyboard is a breeze to type with, but the track pad (who even uses those anymore) is God-awful. It feels flimsy to use and is a pain to get used to.  I finally just bought a a wireless mouse and threw the dongle for that in the 2.0 port.  Speaking of which, this computer comes standard with one USB 2.0 Port and one USB 3.0 Port.  Realizing that this was completely unrealistic for a person like myself, I bought a USB 3.0 Port Hub and now use that to plug all my peripherals into.  Good stuff.\n\nIn all, the X551MA is not the best laptop in the grand forest that is Amazon, but it will get the job done... eventually... if you can install it on Win 8.1... and if your processor doesn't cap at 100% for twenty-seven seconds straight."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "The ASUS X551M was one of the most disappointing purchases that I have made in buying an ASUS laptop.  The physical quality of the laptop is designed utilizing extremely flimsy plastic that feels very cheap to the touch.  Simply applying a bit of pressure to various sections of the computer's surface reveals that the outer design bends, as opposed to remaining fairly sturdy, suggesting that the internal hardware may be susceptible to damage if dropped because of the lack of firmness of the shell.  Because of this unfortunate flaw, the external design seems to serve as a \"word\" of caution as to the long term performance and durability of the X551M's internal components (only time will tell).\n\nWhen I made this purchase, it was more out of consideration for my wife's sanity regarding our finances, yet as the saying goes, \"You get what you pay for.\"  The $249.00 price tag is appealing if you absolutely and/or desperately need a laptop because it is a necessity for your schooling or small business needs but do not expect to get more in quality than the amount you pay for at check out.  Basically, if you are looking into purchasing an ASUS laptop, invest your money into a slightly more expensive model and you will find that the overall quality was worth every penny."}

I can also use Dragon Naturally and VLC Player just fine.\n\nIf you want to use this for hardcore gaming this is not the laptop for you. I think thats a given though with the price. The only true disappointment I have with this is the wifi. It is pathetically weak. I can be in the same room as the router and have almost no ability to watch YouTube videos. I really expected better wifi capabilities than this. Sense I am often on the road for months at a time I typically resort to my Galaxy s3 for any sort of web based activity.\n\nBeyond capabilitys I also have issues with the layout. The machine takes too long to shutdown in comparison to how fast it turns on. Thus you will sometimes close the lid thinking its off only to find out later that it was still on and the battery is dead. Also, the keys are spaced too far apart and can be annoying. Then theres the track pad that is too slick and it can be difficult to twill if you're clicking the right/left mouse button without looking down.\n\nI give it a 2 simply because of the weak wifi. With better wifi I would have given it a 4 sense i can forgive all the other issues. I want a computer with wifi that I can use from my hotel room or car. Not one when I have to be in the commons area surrounded by other people after a long day of work when I just want some alone time.\n\n*****UPDATE*****\nWell, that's $230.00 down the drain. After one year this computer had slowed down dramatically. The speed at which it turn on is still the same. However, all of the programs are taking much longer to start. Without any programs running I can turn on Word and have more than enough time for a bathroom brake. The delay gets even worse with programs such as Dragon Natural."}

Unfortunately, after about a week of use, I spent the last three days painstakingly removing all the malware that ASUS preloaded on the laptop. They preloaded various trial games that were particularly nasty. They preloaded stormwatch, which is a clear malware vehicle of attack. I had to remove trojan horse so-called cleaner tools, a variety of preloaded adware/malware such as the likes of tidynetwork, WSE_taplika, genious-box from registry, IE settings, file system, start-up programs, and the usual uninstall efforts. Thanks for nothing ASUS. Of particular concern is the \"man in the middle\" network proxy stealer that intercetps and reads all your traffic.  So, thanks to ASUS and their malware preload, I am sure to have experienced identity theft on various levels.\n\nIf you value your identity, don't buy any ASUS computer.\n\nBTW - where is that OS CD?\n\nThe instructions to this nightmare are as follows: charge the battery for three hours, hit the power button.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "Good lightweight laptop.  My wife wanted a basic laptop for reading and writing stories and general web surfing.  She indicated she didn't particularly want a touch screen or need a DVD drive.  This basic laptop fit the bill quite well.  It is fast enough, lightweight and has a usable screen size.\n\nMy wife said she wanted windows because it will be more familiar and easier to use than linux (We have linux on our primary desktop).  After trying and hating windows 8, we switched to linux mint with libreoffice, which is much faster and somewhat surprisingly more familiar (she was used to win XP and office 2003).\n\nThis laptop and all others with win 8 come with secure boot enabled, so you cannot access the bios by pressing F2 at startup, regardless of what the manual says.  You have to boot win 8 and go through several confusing menus to access the bios.  From there you can disable secure boot and allow booting from the a USB flash drive (After secure boot is disabled you can access the bios by pressing F2 on boot).  From that point, linux mint is easy to install and took less time than figuring out how to access the bios.  Linux mint properly recognized the ethernet, wireless, touchpad, and graphics drivers automatically, no manual tweaking or installing drivers was necessary.\n\nThe bios on this laptop is UEFI, but has an old school interface like bios.  But let's face it: how often do you really need to access the bios and do you really need pretty pictures and music playing while you do?  I found the bios straight forward and easy to use (after disabling secure boot)."}

I'm a student, and although I already have a nice custom-built desktop computer that I do most of my work on, I felt like I would benefit from having something portable to have in-class or while hanging out on campus.\n\nThis is, obviously, not a laptop for gaming. Out of curiosity I installed Skyrim on it and surprisingly it did run the game on low settings (albeit not with ideal fps) and it ran Minecraft fairly well (minor stuttering from time to time--but still definitely playable). If you're buying a laptop with the intention of gaming or any other intensive computer tasks I would highly recommend you look into the $500+ price range for a laptop with more capable specs."}

In fact, I'm returning this pile of  trash and getting a Chromebook, myself. Windows 8.1 is absolutely infuriating to use, the web cam is abysmal and after TWO DAYS of owning it the thing stopped connecting to the Internet. It's connected to WiFi, it says Internet available, but it doesn't connect at all, just like MANY other reviews here have stated. Every other device in my house is connected to the WiFi perfectly, but this hunk of crap just decided that it doesn't want to make use of the connection after 2 days. The keyboard is flimsy and loud, there are no light indicators for caps lock, etc, there are only 2 USB ports and only one of them is 2.0, should I keep going on the list of negative points? Because I could do this all day. I'm honestly blown away at how horrible this pile of fail is. I do not understand how it got all the positive reviews, these people must not actually be using this computer. Not to mention my Note 4 is more than twice as fast as this piece of trash. I absolutely can't wait to return it and get my money back. Learn from my mistake of buying this thing and spend your money elsewhere!!! If you still decide to buy it, you can't say you weren't warned!"}

You get a 30 day trial of it for free which is useless because you ultimately have to pay $100 to keep using it. For a cheap laptop, it becomes expensive when you have to add $100 just to be able to read and use documents. I don't understand why they don't just build in a year of office with the program. What looked like a good computer is actually useless if I can't use it to create, read and use documents of any type. Feels like a complete rip off to me and I am annoyed that I didn't understand that when I bought it. It's a great way for Microsoft to take $100 right out of your pocket and very bad customer service.

The keyboard will wake it up if it's only been sleeping a short while, but not after sleeping overnight."}

The camera is very low quality and it lags.

That annoys me a lot but other than that it's a great laptop."}

They've just placed a dummy there. I can't believe that the older model of this laptop, with same specs has dvd. Anyway, I replaced the hdd with a 120gb kingston ssd, which I bought for 58$. Installed windows on it, and I don't feel the slowness of the Celeron all that much anymore. The trackpad very uncomfortable, slow and inaccurate. I guess they could have done that better. Overall feel and design of the laptop is ok. Display is what you would expect from a 250$ laptop - standard cheap laptop led. Battery life is normal. I am going to add the dvd drive myself.

The mouse and cursor work well with the Windows 8.1 that comes installed.  The unit comes with a lot of needless App icons and that needed to be cleaned up.  The biggest con of the purchase is getting rid of the \"malware\" that takes over your screen when in the middle of using an App.  It's very annoying!  You have to search the settings to find out where they are resident and eliminate them.  After about 8 hrs., I finally have it cleaned up and settings re-done to make it ready for my FIL to use with a fair bit of confidence.  I want him to have a good experience with the technology.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "This is a budget laptop (at $249 when I purchased) and it is most evident in the mouse pad and responsiveness when scrolling. The mouse pad is \"stiff\" and makes clicking on, for instance, a tile in a Scrabble game, more laborious than it should be. I have mainly owned Dell laptops in the past and have never experienced such an awkward mouse pad that requires a lot of pressure to click and move a cursor or object. A wireless mouse may be the answer to this dilemma. When scrolling using the mouse pad on the side bar, it is often slow. The screen is bright and clear and the keyboard is comfortable while including a numeric keypad on the right side which is quite convenient when keying numbers in spreadsheets. Overall this will be fine for my kids to use to work on homework and research topics for school, however, if you're accustomed to a Dell and don't mind putting another $50 toward a laptop I would recommend doing so."}

The second one kept freezing and the cooling fan sounded like an Apache helicopter taking off and landing repeatedly. I was trying to run simple programs such as excel, outlook, youtube, ETC and it just couldn't handle it all at once. if you are looking to multi-task, I would strongly suggest at least upgrading to an i3 processor . It would probably be ok for the casual internet user, but the quality was my problem . It felt cheap the second I opened the box which Is to be expected for this price, but the fact that it didn't function properly was a deal breaker."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "This is a solid little laptop.  Let me start by saying, don't buy this for gaming, don't buy this if you don't know how to use/ don't want to learn how to use Windows 8.  Aside from those two things I can't see why anyone would give this laptop a bad review.  I'm studying computer science and I've been in college for the last 3 years.  This laptop is better than any laptop I've owned over the last 3 years for school and for play.  School wise it runs every program I need like a charm.  No problem with Visual Studio whatsoever.  Usually I have Visual Studio, Pandora, E-mail, and Word brought up all at the same time and even with all of that going this laptop runs strong and doesn't slow down at all.  Great for all web browsing, streaming is great.  I've streamed from Netflix, Youtube, and various anime sites with no problem. The fans run cool and are super super quiet.  The keyboard is compact and has a logical layout that works well for me(an indicator light for caps lock would have been appreciated but is not included.)  The touch pad works with no problem(though I still prefer using my usb mouse). It's super light and easy to carry around, that will be great for taking it on commutes to and from school. The design is durable, it looks professional and the design keeps it from getting smudged up or scratched. The battery holds up great compared to other laptops I've had in the past.  I don't know the exact hours for battery life but I have noticed that even with heavy streaming I don't have to plug up as often as I have with various laptops in the past(including Acer which to me has the best battery life overall.) If you take care of it I feel this laptop will last a very long time.  I'll update if anything goes wrong with it but so far it's running great.  Overall it's a great inexpensive laptop 250 dollars and it does all I need.\n\nIt should be noted that this laptop DOES NOT have a single 500 gig hard drive,  it has two hard drives one called OS with about 200 gig free and one called data with about 250 free.  You have about 450 gig of usable space along with cloud storage given free from time to time from ASUS(when doing things like registering the laptop on ASUS site.)  To me this isn't an issue because I use flash drives for all my school work and I have a few backup laptops.  If you're using this as a primary computer and don't have any backups it may be a good idea to buy some cloud storage or flash drives for extra space if you need it.\n\n-Update 1/28/16\nAfter having this laptop for a little over a year I think a followup is in order.  This laptop is still a beast, even after dragging it around from work, school, etc.  I take it pretty much everywhere I go and to this day it still handles everything I need.  Overall I'm still very happy with it.  The laptop has taken 2 falls since I got it.  One was about a 5ft drop onto concrete.  I picked it up, turned it back on and have had no problems with it.  The next was about a 3ft drop onto a rug (with hardwood under it).  The laptop survived both falls without any damage (aside from aesthetics) the top of it is scratched but aside from that no other issues.  My wife also bought this laptop after her old one died out and she has had no problems with hers either.  The battery still holds up strong, I'm still not exactly sure how long it lasts but I can get through a whole school day without charging it.\n\nI made the comment in the beginning not to get this for gaming.  I still stand by that statement for the most part.  I have run The Elder Scrolls Oblivion on it and it..... worked.  I couldn't go past medium quality which to me looked almost as good as what it would on a PS3 or Xbox 360.  I've also run Minecraft on it but I really don't recommend it.  It's playable but it's not high quality by any means.  I tried changing all kinds of settings to get it to look/run better but had no luck.  The last game I played on it was Back to the Future (Telltale) which worked, but was very laggy.  I still stand my ground that I wouldn't WANT to use this for gaming.  It's more of the productivity styled laptop which is great for school and work."}

However, I thought I'd mention that it seems to work very well, although some of the games like to crash - not sure if that's the computer or not. I can't speak for the effectiveness of the Wi-Fi, unfortunately, as my house is very good at blocking it as soon as you enter a different room. One of the only things that really annoys me functionality-wise is the touch pad. It works just fine, but there's no scroll on the side, and it's hard to tell at first that there are left and right click buttons. They're fused with the rest of it, with only a little white line giving any indication. When I first pressed on it I thought I was going to break it. But it works just fine. The other annoying aspect of this is that the battery seems to drain really fast. I don't play intense games (just Mahjong and the Microsoft Puzzle game), but I am on the internet a lot. I tend to just keep the laptop plugged in most of the time."}

It was packaged really nicely and I was able to read the serial number and all the other info I would need to enter about 700 times in order to get some/any assistance at all.  I have a HP Slate 23\" screen (of course a touch screen - which I hate) ..  so that is the only way I can write this review....  I powered it up and I was absolutely sure I was going to love it - easy to use and I don't do anything to tax any computer.  During the 22 hours I have had the Asus I have spent half that time waiting for updates to load with a error of something happened and updates were not completed, lost connection to my super reliable Verizon Wi-Fi, hours of running troubleshooting, admin resetting Wi-Fi adapter and still nothing.  I have been able to get online for approximately 10 minutes total.  I wrote to ASUS - on the HP of course and they opened a case which they will reply in up to 48 hours....  I cannot tell you how frustrating this is - I have never had any piece of equipment fail so miserably ..  I realize for 249. you aren't going to get much, but to get nothing but wasted time is unacceptable.  I am going to return and if I get burned for a restocking fee or?  so be it.

She won't take care of it anyway!  It is kind of clunky looking and not the sleek-and-slim, newer body style.  No touch screen.  It's the larger size laptop, which she likes.  No backlit keys.  To look at it you would think it was heavy.  It really isn't!  The shell is not smooth, it has a texture to it.  Two USB ports, one HDMI, an old-looking port for a monitor.  So for $250 bucks, you can't beat it in my opinion."}

It did come with Windows 8.1 and I set the system up to dual boot into linux mint 17.  It's perfect for my consulting business.  I did purchase the extended warranty.

I don't know if it was because mine was on the top of the package and his is on the bottom, but his never turned on and we're currently trying to get a refund / replacement for his. It's upsetting because this is the third Asus product I've had that has died on me for no reason princi I had a tablet me and my boyfriend had the same time but we got on Black Friday last year and his just died, and upon going to the store we ran into an employee who had the same thing happened to him and his daughter with the same tablet so he let us get credit and he ended up getting the Amazon Kindle HD or whatever its called. And before that I had a decent Asus laptop when I was used to game it was about $400 or so and within the year its charging port broke twice the first two times the insurance did cover it but the next two times I had to pay for out-of-pocket myself $80 twice. And now it still won't turn on again meaning it has broke for the fifth time and I have a lot of info saved on there so I can't just get rid of it. I'm very upset with ASUS right now and I will never order from them again and I would recommend you wouldn't either. I also had trouble on my old laptop with them telling me my windows wasn't valid I'm unsure if that was the fault of me or the computer but I wouldn't put it past the computer itself. Was very upset because it takes about 4 weeks to get a refund / replacement and we could use the money now. Stay away from Asus. As for my computer it works. Not incredibly well though. The mouse is loud and sticks a lot and it's hard to left click.it also has a tendency to freeze and be quite slow. It'll do for now though I'm not sure I'll ever be able to game on it. Now I mainly use it for browsing the internet and email etc. Now I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop in mind to die on me. Buyer beware."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "I recently just purchased this laptop a few hours ago at Best Buy and thought that I should post a first impression on my experience with this laptop. I was looking for a laptop that was going to be able to fulfill all of my basic computer tasks (ie. using Microsoft Office, browsing the internet, checking emails, etc.). So far this machine has been alright. It is a large computer but not bulky like some other models that I've seen in store. This computer runs on Intel Dual Celeron which is the same processor that has been used with other older models. It sometimes takes a little long to load a page up or for a click to fully be recognized and sent to the next page but I'm a very patient person so that doesn't really bother me too much. The touchpad is OK. I prefer tapping it than actually using the buttons because the entire touchpad is flat and can be difficult to press the buttons down hard enough for the computer to take effect. My wireless mouse solves that issue though. One downside that may not be important to other people that I kind of care about it that this machine does not have a optical drive. I know that CDs are getting kind of outdated but I think it's nice to have one anyways for watching DVD and a reading CDs and putting that media onto the computer. This problem could easily be solved by purchasing an external optical drive but like said, it's just nice having one already built-in already. The keyboard is actually really easy to type on. The key are evenly spaced out and there's also a number pad on the right side. I just wish that there was a light to indicate when the caps lock and number lock keys were on. I'm very new to Windows 8.1 but I found that it is really easy to adapt to and it's so customizable. It's actually simple to navigate everything now. I would only recommend this for students like myself that only need a computer for basic computer uses or for parents looking for a laptop to purchase for their kids. This machine probably would not be able to handle any heavy duty gaming but it does come with a lot of space for storage and it's not at a bad price for all of the features that you will be getting from this computer."}

I had to replace my old Sony Vaio [the fan was a jet engine during games anyways], paid 700 for that back in 2010, and this runs MORE games than that ever did, at a way lower price.

DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU PLAN ON CHANGING THE OS. I have had to refresh this computer twice and I've only had it for a week. I do not recommend it. I called Asus and they also really don't have a long-term solution for this. I can't really write about the \"pros\" besides it being lightweight and the charger being small. Everything else is just average and when you throw in the horrible Os, it's not worth the money. The camera quality sucks, so don't think that you'll be using Skype or recording any videos. BUT the sound quality of the speakers are EXCELLENT! They are superb! Oh, and the battery lasts pretty long! I haven't really kept track but definitely 5 hours and up. Also, the battery is built in so if you ever need to get a new battery you will be SOL. The screen is a really nice size, and it's definitely not too big for class or carrying around campus. Just pray that when you turn it on it hasn't updated. So I give three stars, yes it has good speakers and a long battery life but when the hell will you be able to enjoy these if you keep having to refresh and update the computer?"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "This laptop offers solid proof to the old adage \"You get what you pay for\". At a price-point of 220 USD, one should *not* expect a rock-solid chassis or other bells-and-whistles that would otherwise come with a higher-priced unit.\n\nThat said, the ASUS X551MAV-EB01-B is constructed of flimsy-feeling plastic, including the touchpad and its buttons, keyboard and overall chassis. Due to the cheap plastic core, it's noisy and hollow-sounding, while typing or using the touchpad.\n\nMoreover, there's no CD / DVD optical drive which makes things a bit more cumbersome to do routine off-network / stand-alone installs.\n\nThere are two things I am most disappointed about:\n(1) the lack of BLUE TOOTH. In this day and age, everything from my automobile to simple household gadgets offers blue tooth connectivity ... just not this ASUS laptop?!\n(2) For some unknown reason, Windows Updates take EXTREMELY long to download and install. I manage several computers (desktops and laptops alike) that are running Windows 8.1 and *none* of them have this issue .. only this ASUS laptop?! And, since the laptop arrived with outdated Windows 8, upgrading to Win8.1 consumed an entire evening of my time.\n\nIn summary, if you are looking for a cheap (in every conceivable way) laptop, this may be for you.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "This machine was an unexpected surprise at only 199 dollars!\nI bought it for my parents as an entry level laptop that could deal with their daily tasks and last them a while, and while I wasn't expecting too much from this machine, I am glad I went for it as it's pretty rock solid.\n\nI always dreaded to buy anything with the \"Celeron\" mark on it, so this was a tough choice. I was going to go for the similar model that's powered by an i3 and also has an optical DVD combo burner. In the end, availability and economy, plus a lot of reading of reviews, veered me towards this machine. The specs are basically the same save for 2 extra GB of RAM and Hyperthreading technology available on the i3 model. Other than that, this is the exact same machine.\n\nThe computer works great with everything I tested it with. I ran a bunch of Modern UI and legacy apps on Windows 8.1 without problems. I ran into a few issues with the App Store but this is all Windows fault,m really, and nothing to do with the machine. I bet reinstalling this to Windows 7 64-bit would work awesome. But I think Windows 8 is better suited to my parents and for general family use.\nI was expecting the lack of the 2 threads the i3 model had would be very noticeable, but I guess it kind of compensates by having the two cores clocked at a higher frequency.\n\nThis machine is LARGE, I mean, I never had a laptop this huge. I chose this size because I thought the readability would be better for older people, specially since the resolution of the screen, 1366x768, it's not gigantic. Had this been full 1080, I think text would have been too small to read for my parents, and although you can use the enlarge option for UI elements on Windows, it doesn't always work well with a lot of applications. Still, if you want something transportable, this might not be the best choice. In our case the machine will stay at home all the time and moved here and there rarely. It's perfect for that and takes less space than the desktop my parents currently have.\n\nDespite its large size, the machine is rather lightweight, though. I think not having an optical drive helps a lot in this aspect.\n\nBattery life was excellent. I had it on installing stuff and watched a Flash Player based movie and it lasted for about 5 hours, I plugged it in when it still had a bunch of juice left!\n\nThe lowest point of this machine is probably the hard drive. I found it to be rather slow for my liking, but then again, I am probably spoiled because I have had an SSD in my main machine for over 3 years and things are so fast with it. I guess I'll update it to an SSD when the warranty runs out.\n\nIt also comes with some ASUS garbage-ware that I proceeded to remove right away. Don't remove everything though, some things are needed for the machine's operation. But stuff like 30 day trial of McAfee is total garbage (I replaced it right away with the great, and free, Avast).\n\nIn all, this is a VERY recommended entry level family laptop, that excels in its battery life and the \"bang for your buck\" factor. It will do everything you want to do at home smoothly and without problems, and it won't kill your wallet in the process."}

However, this ASUS notebook (and possibly future versions) are not recommended and should be avoided! First of all, there is no way to get to the BIOS so you cannot, for example, set the BIOS to make a USB flash drive bootable. It is impossible to install Windows 7 on this laptop because it does not have a DVD drive and will not boot from a USB drive. This is really a crippled computer that is useless except for maybe basically accessing the Internet or for use as a dedicated data collection device.

At least it happened well within my 30 days to return it.\n\n11/25/14\nMight be harsh giving it 3 stars as it just arrived tonight. First observations though is that it seems a bit top heavy and I don't like how there is no cd drive.  When I got this I knew there wasn't going to be one, but I got it on the assumption (my bad I guess) that it was too thin to include one, rather than having a blank drive where a cd drive can easily be installed. It also seems like it can be easily tipped over because the screen is much heavier than the base.  Actual functionality has (had*) been smooth, but the design isn't best.  I DO like how quiet it is.

I only play WoW, the Sims, and a few indie Steam games, so that's not too much of a disappointment. Sometimes if I'm streaming video and open more than one or two additional tabs, the video gets choppy or the other tabs run slowly.\n\nIt is astonishingly light compared to my last (Acer) laptop, and unlike the wiggly charge ports that Acer is notorious for, this one seems like it will hold on tightly for a long time.\n\nWindows 8(.1) seems sort of pointless if you're not using a touchscreen. Its aesthetic makes a lot of sense for that purpose, but using a touchpad mouse--it's not really fitting. I deleted the bulk of the preloaded apps as soon as I got it. The color-shifting background is pretty, though.\n\nThe keyboard is pretty good, just getting used to the new placement of things, but mouse is my least favorite part so far. It seems the buttons are closer to the bottom center of the pad, not closer to the outer edges like I'm used to, so I either have to a) push really hard to click on things (I've never been a tapper), or b) click easily in the middle, but accidentally right-click when I mean to left-click, or vice versa. Also, I cannot stop accidentally zooming in and out on things.\n\nIn short, it's nothing amazing, but for the $230 I paid for it, it's good enough--and it arrived next day when I used Amazon Prime, so that was a plus!"}

So the battery life description is a pure lie. I hate the mousepad. In order to scroll it requires 2 fingers to scroll. It is not possible to scroll with only 1 finger, and with the buttons being so hard to push on the mousepad being so hard to push in, it is difficult to do anything such as copy and paste with a right click, or anything. Also it comes with no hard drive dvd/cd which I didn't realize until I tried to play a game which required me to put in a dvd. It really angers me this battery life lasting only a couple of hours and then it is dead."}

Mouse pad makes the mouse move everywhere but where you want it. just cheap light weight product. The key board worked half the time. you had to pound on the keys sometimes.

The only good thing I have to say about this is NOTHING about the product. The good part is AMAZON ROCKS!!! I called customer service, said I hated it, told the representative just a few of my  complaints and he said \" No problem\" \"Ship it back\". I received full credit on my Amazon store account the minute UPS picked it up !!! I love Amazon. plus I think they are becoming aware this PC is junk.  The reviews I read that were 5 stars....... Are you people new to the world of computers ??? Or just never had a quality PC??? I know this thing is only 250.00 but for another 100.00 you can buy a cheap HP and its 3 times the computer... I have a 2009 HP 6910c with windows 7 ultimate on it. That PC being 8 years old is a dinosaur yet is still LIGHT YEARS ahead in quality compared to this ASUS.

I got so fed up I decided to install Ubuntu but the ASUS BIOS makes booting from a USB device next to impossible.  It took many F2 attempts before it would boot to the BIOS most of them went straight to Windows.  Most BIOS give a choice of boot devices (hard drive, USB, CD/DVD and etc), this bios has only one.  It does allow additional boot options to be set up but YOU must enter the path to the device and I don't even know if this will actually work because I have been unable to determine the path to my USB DVD.  I know some people who have ASUS computers and they like them but I hate this thing."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "I recently purchased two of these laptops - the second one being a replacement for the first.\n\nThe first one I ordered had a faulty video driver. The video display would crash occasionally without rhyme or reason. I kept the laptop a week, updating drivers and thinking it was something I could fix. The problem only got worse, and by the time I ordered a replacement laptop via Amazon it would turn on and the display would immediately crash then reboot, over and over, again and again.\n\nThinking this was a fluke, perhaps a dirty Intel chip or an overheating issue, I ordered an easy replacement via Amazon Prime. The second laptop, out of its box, had a dead display. Not a crashing driver like the first one - the screen was completely dead. If I shook it or pressed around the edges of the screen it flickered on and off, looking like a scrambled LCD mess.\n\nSuffice to say, I returned the second and am trying my hand at a different brand for a budget laptop."}

Haven't tested it out with any heavy gaming but it does seem to run them at a decent pace, as World of Warcraft ran at a steady 20+ frames on high settings.\nMy only quarrel with the product is that the mouse-pad could have been a little better made, as I find it a little difficult to use the left and right click buttons, and often when I try to click it will also cause the mouse to move. Other than that.. I like it.\n\nUpdate: It can handle gaming.. Just not too well. Minecraft single-player is impossible to play, as the processor lacks the sufficient power required to handle things like world generation, and Mob movement. But it just barely meets the requirements to play games such as Borderlands 2, and Skyrim. If you're looking for a laptop for intensive gaming, you may want to look elsewhere."}

As a toy, this machine delivers value.\n\n**now a more critical review looking at this laptop as a regular daily machine while still keeping its price point in mind.  (things i think even a cheap laptop could have fixed without a great deal of manf expense**\n\nPros:\nPerformance\ndecent screen\nLow power\nUSB 3 support\nHDMI out\n\nCons:\nIf you do a lot of typing the keyboard will infuriate you.  The cheap keyboard misstypes constantly.\nThe track pad is terrible.  The location and size will have your cursor constantly push your cursor elsewhere.  Lack of separate buttons (the buttons are part of the main trackpad) makes selecting awkward and difficult.  You will want a mouse to work with this machine.\nOnly two USB ports."}

So they were kinda blown out of the water when i told them i was gonna purchase this laptop. The reason i bought this was merely out of curiosity to be honest, wanted to see if a low budget laptop could get me through the day doing basic applications and so forth. I think this laptop is a great piece of technology for it price tag, if you are on a budget you should try this out. It's not a touchscreen nor does it have optical drive. but it's light and easy to carry around when you're on the go. Oh, in case you're are wondering, i've tried playing a few games from my steam account on this, CS, L4D, KILLING FLOOR, street fight iv at low-med specs, while some of my other games didn't work, but that's not the purpose of this purchase. the keyboard layout is nice i my opinion, keys are well spaced and a numpad is included. kinda wish there lights to indicate CAPS lock and NUM lock. i'm not a fan of the touchpad so i purchased a wireless mouse to accompany this and the battery life is fairly decent for it's price. I'm still going through the gears with it, this just my 3rd day with it so if i notice anything else i'll update my post."}

My fianc's Dell laptop is very bulky and loud (motor in it) when he turns his on, and I'm glad that this ASUS is not. I love the apps, and how you can go from Windows 8 and back to Windows 7. The battery life is also a plus, it can stay charged for 8 hours, without having it plugged in. The only item that I do not like is the OneDrive \"Cloud System\" that comes with the program, but you can just enable it. Some people like to synch all their files to other systems like phones or kindles, but I'm old school and I don't trust that mysterious hard drive (but it's not a big deal). It is most definitely worth the money and the sound is amazing as well. I am very happy with the shipment and I also love the carrying box case it comes with as well.

I don't need the screen full of aps I'll never use, so deleted most of them.  But then the McAfee anti-virus program that came installed began popping up virus warning after virus warning and would not remove them.  It was a mess and certainly not what I wanted popping up over my presentations.  So I uninstalled McAfee and installed Norton 360, which seems to have solved my virus, adware, malware attacks. Now the computer boots up much faster and responds more like it should.  The way it operates now, I would probably give it 4 or 4.5 stars.  I don't like the combination touchpad/left and right mouse controls.  Would rather have them separate and the touch pad is not very sensitive without some muscle.  Using a mouse makes things much happier.  All in all, though, it seems to be a good product for my needs.  Sure wish it had Windows 7, though..."}

Several times I have tested out how long it lasts while watching Netflix without the power connected and it seemed like I went several nights (watching an hour long show) and days (surfing the net and day to day productivity) without having to plug it in.  This is with the HDD.  I would assume that when I replace the HDD with an SSD that it will last that much longer.\n\nIntel's baytrail CPU is exceptional.  For day to day productivity use it definitely keeps up (Microsoft office, Netflix, web browsing, etc.)\n\nThe first downside is the screen resolution.  I would really have liked to see Asus offer the same model with a 1080p screen for a little more.  I would have paid $50 more for the higher resolution... but from what I could tell there was no offering.  You would have to pay the premium for the better screen resolution.\n\nAlso, omitting the optical drive tray is not at all a bad thing, however, I would have designed the laptop to be a little more thin since that space wasn't going to be utilized to house a \"stock\" optical drive.  I know it was cheaper for Asus to just use their existing case and omit the optical drive but now it looks like there should be one there but there isn't because we wanted the cheapest laptop."}

If you're taking notes, and your eyes are on your professor, you look down and your writing is a jarble of long extended words with no spaces, it makes me want to throw my laptop into a wall. When you're writing papers, typing quickly, and keep having to go back over and over and over and add spaces in between words, it makes me want to do a laptop toss.

This laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing. The speakers are fairly basic, so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies. The touchpad is a little \"clunky\" for my taste; I use a small external mouse with laptops  in any event. I appreciate the relatively large keyboard (with number pad) and screen size. I also found the track pad irritating until I disabled \"pinch zoom.\" This is larger laptop, but is not too heavy. Battery life is great - though it is new. The power chord is a little short compared to most laptops. Overall, a solid laptop for its price."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "First, let me start by saying this Asus Laptop may very well be the best buy out there for the money. Now, reasons? First, it comes with a dual core Intel Processor. It has a 500gb Hard Drive, and 4GB of ram. Now, set up is very simple, even if you have never used window 8.1 before, which is another factor. You don't want a laptop with just windows 8, be sure it has the upgraded 8.1 version installed. That has eliminated the nagging little issues that windows 8 originally had. When you first turn the Asus on, it will ask you to verify your Microsoft email account, meaning Hotmail, Outlook, Msn. I would suggest opening up one of these before ordering the laptop, it will just save you time prior. Then, after a few quick clicks to accept the system setting itself up, you are good to go. Honestly, this should take about 15 minutes or so. Now, remember, it will quickly identify your wifi connection, and establish the connection for you. Once that is done, you are ready to go. Don't be intimidated by the small window panels you see on your screen, they are nothing more than options to select, to move around on the laptop.. It comes with McAfee Virus and Internet protection, which is good for 30 days, then you can decide to either keep it, or simply use any other program. I strongly suggest McAfee or Norton on this laptop. Now, it does not come with a DVD/cd Rom Drive, so if that is a major factor for you, then there is another Asus model, about $15.00 more that does include the optical drive. Most people find very little use for it these days, since almost everything can simply be downloaded these days anyway. The screen is 15.6\", bright clear. The sound is also very nice from this laptop. It has a full size keyboard, 2 USB Ports, one is a 2.0 and one is a 3.0, which is for faster performance. It has a trial version of Microsoft Office also installed. All things being equal, I have nothing negative at all to say about this Asus laptop, and highly recommend it. Feel free to ask me any questions, and I will do my best to answer. I believe you will be very happy with this product. I will also mention there is one other laptop out there I also would suggest, the same price and specs is the Acer Aspire ES1-511-C59V 15.6-Inch Laptop (Diamond Black) This is also an excellent buy for the money, in case you prefer Acer over Asus. Both great performing laptops."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "UPDATED 6/23/17 - 3 years later..\n1) Battery is NOT user replaceable and completely failed in early 2016 making this a hassle to use as an online student since I always needed to be near an outlet. Cost to replace battery by someone I trust who is willing to crack open the case is $100, I might as well buy another laptop - and I will.\n2) Battery that also keeps the internal clock failed in summer 2016. So I have to reset the time every time the computer powers up or wakes up from sleep.\n3) Surprisingly, even now, the laptop successfully runs an almost full version of ArcGIS, Citrix (as part of a Statistics class package), and any, many web-based apps I needed for my classes including various videoconferencing software programs, Adobe Presenter, and other video and graphics heavy programs.\n4) Keyboard started to fail in early 2016 - related to battery? It functions but I have to POUND on the keys and spacebar.\n5) Computer can barely handle Microsoft Visual Studio for beginning coding classes, yet it meets the minimum requirements set by my instructor and school.\n6) I tried gaming on this - Wildstar and Kingdom Hearts I think - don't try unless you have patience. I was just checking the games to see if I could even give this to a kid to use, nope.\n7) Hard drive NEVER gave me a problem or crashed.\n8) Screen hinges still aligned, screen still perfect!\n\nVerdict - laptop got me to college graduation but will not get me through grad school. Next laptop will have user replaceable battery and upgradable RAM for sure. Can't complain about the cost, but I will complain that had it been better made I'd keep using it! I may hook it up to a monitor and keyboard and convert it to a desktop, but the RAM will always be an issue.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUsing my new computer to type this review. I am a Mac person at home and a PC person at work. This is my first ever Windows laptop. The major things I notice between this $275 computer (which was $200 3 weeks ago *sigh*) and others are:\n1) Keyboard has a cheap feel - just feels like typing on a toy keyboard.\n2) This item came with an Optical Drive which I did not want or need. I wrote Amazon and they basically said that because it was fulfilled by a 3rd party for Amazon they had no control over the inventory. Personally I think they are just getting rid of inventory and no one cares about updating the description or making a description for a model with and a model without an optical drive\n3) Comes preloaded with Asus bloatware that takes a while to find and remove. Because it has the manufacturer's name you may think it is necessary software - no, I did not need wedding planning software, thanks. Also includes trial MS Office 365 which I uninstalled. Save some pain, uninstall all the unnecessary software before configuring your system and then make a backup of that image in case you need to do a full restore.\n4) Runs 8.1. I'm not very familiar with 8, so can't say anything useful. Desktop looks like Windows 7, but has that annoying Start screen with tiles, spent hours deleting them and adding ones I would really use. Learning lots of Windows shortcuts so I can get to the Control Panel, Command Prompt screen, etc.\n5) There is a sticker with a number on the bottom of the computer, it's very small and doesn't stick, that's your serial number! If yours falls off like mine did, use this command in the command prompt window: \"wmic bios get serialnumber\"\n6) As another reviewer mentioned, you need your Windows Product Key/Activation Key sometimes, since there's no CD or documentation at all in the box, make sure you get it from your System Info window as soon as you can.\n7) Power key is right above the Esc key (I'm used to it being on the right-hand side), so I keep almost turning off the computer\n8) Revised 9/29 - Someone mentioned that the Num Lock seems to reset itself (there's no indicator light) and that oddly happens to me all the time, not just when the computer is sleeping.\n9) Added 9/29 - Not a defect, but the keyboard is not backlit, I didn't realize what a pain this would be for me. But it's a $200-$275 computer, you don't get all the bonuses.\n\nNot an issue, just a note, but I had backed up my other laptop using a Firewire drive, since this laptop doesn't have a Firewire port the word \"screwed\" comes to mind.\n\nI managed to freeze the computer while installing and uninstalling too much software at once (uninstalling bloat using ShouldIRemoveIt, installing iTunes, downloading Firefox, and a few other things), since then it has run fine. It is very fast, the screen is great and it is quiet.\n\nFor the price, the computer is good, for the lower price a few weeks ago this computer would have been great. I'll just be using it for online classes, viewing class videos, accessing Blackboard, Skype meetings, etc.\n\nDon't know how to explain it, but this computer just feels \"disposable\" to me. I am not planning to invest my life in it I suppose - I'm not keeping photos, a lifetime of documents, lots of software, etc. on it - and because of the price, I won't flip out if it gets scratched up, and I won't feel bad giving it away when I graduate and can afford a better one. I didn't even bother to buy a purchase protection plan, that would have been 25% of the replacement cost.\n\nIt's a good budget laptop for students, a good intro laptop for kids or seniors, and good one to travel with if you don't want to take your \"good\" one with you.\n\nAdded 9/29/14 - After using it for a few days straight, the battery seems to last the stated 4 hours or maybe a bit more on regular power settings - simultaneously using Wi-Fi, IE, Firefox, streaming a video and using MS Word. Like I said the computer feels cheap, but it is really light and doesn't heat up at all. I'm surprised at how good it looks, it has a textured outer surface and for a minute you'd think the interior was brushed metal and not plastic, but then you pick it up or type on it. I'm more impressed with it as time goes by."}

If you do buy their product, you'd better pray that you don't have any problems with it, because you won't get any help from ASUS. In the year that I had one of their laptops, mine broke down 5 times. Every time I sent it into their 'service' center, the part they replaced failed again within months, or even weeks. At the end I was so sick of spending hours and hours on the phone with them, paying to have my laptop shipped back time and again for repairs that I gave up. Amazon was great enough to offer me a partial refund for the unit, but ASUS refused to do anything. They also promised call backs from supervisors on at least 3 occasions and I still have never heard back from them.\nPlease save yourself the horrible headache and loss of data and time. Stick with Toshiba, or really anyone other than ASUS."}

First Windows 8 should not ever be used on a non-touch-face laptop (by now all laptops should be touch-face anyways), if at all. Windows 8 plus a ridicules amount of bloatware (Does ASUS still think it is the 1990's?) makes use and set up of this device a nightmare. It is good for looking at pictures and browsing though useless apps but that is about it. If you want to use it to work on forget it. Surf the Internet? Forget it. The blatant user interface design violations are too many to count. But even once you learn the moronic system it will not help since the mouse clicks rarely activate the corners and edges like they are supposed too.

I did remove the sample programs it came with, especially the  virus checker, switched to free Windows Defender. Don't like Windows 8.1 interface, so downloaded startisback, a $3 download that makes using a Windows 8 computer work like Windows 7.\n\nWhat I love the most (besides the 219 price I paid) is how smooth the multitouch trackpad works. The machine works well for web browsing, email, printing, Netflix, Youtube, etc, reasonably fast, no buffering or stuttering delays w video.  Also, runs impressively long on the battery for a cheap laptop. Extremely quiet, does have a fan, but I can't hear it, even in a silent room, unless I put my ear right on the computer. Runs cool, has a tiny charge brick that uses barely more juice than my phone charger. very good wifi connection speed.\n\nWhat I don't like: No indicator lights, not even a power on light, no caps lock light, no hard drive light. I don't really use a number pad, so it is wasted space to me.\n\nI don't miss DVD drive, haven't used DVDs for at least a year, and I have a cheap external DVD drive if I should ever need one."}

It is decently fast and easy to use for everyday stuff like web browsing, YouTube, email, Word, Excel, etc. The part that really impressed me is that I am actually able to run Adobe Lightroom 5 on this laptop surprisingly well. I am a beginner and only use it to edit a few photos on weekends but it runs with very little slowdown. I wouldn't recommend it to serious photographers due to the small hard drive and budget CPU but it does run Lightroom well enough to use lightly. The cons: it is built of somewhat cheap plastic, lightweight, easy to scratch and not very protective if the laptop were to be dropped. I would NOT recommend this laptop to anyone that is hard on their stuff.  It feels a bit cheap and fragile. There is no optical (CD/DVD) drive as every other review has already made clear. It can only hold 4 GB of RAM and the battery is internal, hard to replace for non- tech types. The CPU and graphics card will not run most games well, if at all. Overall this laptop is like a fuller featured netbook- made for light use for students or older adults on a budget who don't expect it to last for more than 2 or 3 years. It does everything a Chromebook does and more for the same price and I highly recommend it."}

It is more than enough while doing basic programming in Visual Studio. It is incredibly silent. When I opened it up I was really surprised when I saw that there was no heatsink for the cpu. It is just a flat piece of metal with no fins. This is another reason why they could make this so cheap. Another surprice to me was the tiny battery. My 11.6 inch acer chromebook has almost twice the battery capacity of this laptop, jet it only manages to get a few more hours than this. That is extremely exiting, for me anyways. I am an electrical guy and I saw so many moding posibilities with this extremely low power laptop. I plan to put a battery where the cd rom is. based on the size of the current battery I estimate I could get the laptop to last over 10 hours maybe a lot more in 1 charge. The current battery lasts about 5 hours. Sometimes more sometimes less, depends on use. This laptop could be made into a very thin ultrabook with some better design. It has a lot of space inside.

All my programs and apps run on it's Windows 8,.1, OS, and it automatically synchs with my desktop and my Amazon Kindle account. through Wi-Fi.  It's encased in black matte and fingerprints are not visible.  It runs quiet and on battery for 5 hours between charges.  Except for my Kindle Fire, this ASUS 500GB makes tablets look anemic,\n\nOkay, so it doesn't have a built-in DVD.  I don't care because I have an external DVD that I  paid fifteen dollars for a year ago - and it fits right into that great $15.00 Laptop carrier that Amazon sells for this sized Laptop.  The Laptop and the optical drive both fit in the carrier.  For me this is a small problem solved."}

BLANK SCREEN. I WOULD LIKE AMAZON TO PLEASE TAKE THIS COMPUTER BACK AND GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!!! WHOEVER IS SELLING THESE COMPUTERSSELLING SUBSTANDARD COMPUTERS!! ALL THAT I SAID BELOW IS TRUE ABOUT THE COMPUTER. BUT I WARN YPU NOT TO BUY IT UNTIL AMAZON INVESTIGATES THIS SELLER!!!\nI like it. I bought it for my son who is in technical college. I really thought it was too good to be true! I read every single review and carefully considered the horror stories. I was very nervous about making this purchase. I don't think the laptop is packaged safely to fully protect the computer, but mine arrived unscathed. It is advertised as not having an optical drive and mine does not. I also noticed people claiming that they only got 200G of hard drive, when 500 is advertised. On mine the 500G is divided. 200 is on the C drive with the OS and desktop folders. I'm assuming that this is the data that will be stored in WebStorage. The remaining 300G's are on the D drive. You can save to either drive. The computer is a budget computer, but very nice looking in my opinion. Sharp. It is very quiet and does not get too warm. If it wasn't for the keyboard clicking, you would hardly know it's there. There are many ports for printers and externals. What you rarely see anymore is a port for Ether Net. This computer has one. The keyboard is somewhat ergonomic and I like the touch pad; its size and location. It is not slow, but it does not click right along either. I get very irritated with slow computers, so this is very important to me. I would get a good bag and/or sleeve as the computer body is not heavy duty by any means. I suggested careful handling to my son. The speakers sound better than any laptop I've had in the past. For the money, I think this laptop is absolutely worth it!!! It's bare bones so to speak, and makes a good computer for kids in school or for home use. The cord fit is snug with a generous cord length. The only downfall is that it doesn't have a touch screen. You can trust that I am being absolutely honest. I was very concerned until it arrived. Now I am very pleased."}

I was lucky enough to catch this Asus when it went on a two day sale.  Otherwise, I may have bought any of the $250 similar ones from Dell, Lenovo or Acer.  The Asus works great, is fast and isn't loaded with bloatware like some others tend to be.  Plenty of speed, ram and hard drive space.  Very happy with this laptop."}

If you want a laptop for normal use, such as watching movies, surfing Internet, word processing, general image editing, etc this laptop is more than enough.  It you have needs like gaming, video editing, or image processing, you know that Celeron processor is not for you.  The display is really good, the inbuilt speaker and webcam are good enough. The wifi is working fine, even on Linux. I showed this laptop to my friend and asked him to guess the price, and he said \"May be $500\".

At first i was reluctant on getting this because of the cheap price, big size, and lack of touchscreen capabilities, but I've had this thing for about a week now and I must say this supports my every needs in a laptop. It is very fast with a great intel processor and a perfect balance between the 4 GB of RAM included/500 GB Hard Drive and 64 bit Operating System; making multitasking and even some gaming a breeze! I've run Minecraft on here with little to no lag, and in the near future i plan on getting games like Titan Fall and The Sims 4 (which if you didn't know all require a good computer if you don't want excessive amounts of lag.) Not to mention its attractive design/build with a finish that isn't prone to fingerprints, has a sturdy feel to it not feeling like cheap plastic, and is very quiet all around generating NO HEAT. If I ever buy another laptop in the future, it will definitely be from ASUS.\n\nIf you are looking for a laptop that has a bigger display and keyboard, attractive and durable design, and a fast processor with some gaming capabilities, all for a budget-friendly price then this might be the right computer for you!"}

In addition they are too small. I have difficulty when using the mouse pad for cut and paste activities. It is very fast and serves it's purpose for me as a graduate student. I didn't read carefully enough to see that it did not have Microsoft office pre-installed so I had to get the PC download for it since it doesn't have a dvd/cd drive. That wasn't a big deal though because I found a 4 yr subscription for students and it downloaded very quickly.

I will do what I can to stop any one from buying from this company EVER.\n\nNow for the long version--\n\nBeen on two tech chats to try and solve connectivity issues. The first person was zero help. I actually set the computer aside for a few weeks since it was taking 5 minutes to open any page and that was IF it would even connect to my wifi. I know what you are thinking...maybe your signal is bad. NOPE. I have many other devices with zero issues. on to the second tech chat. everything was going great. Tech asked a question...I responded and they didn't respond after 20 mins so that was a fail. I then tried every avenue to get in touch with SOMEONE that could make this happen. While not Amazons fault, I contacted them to see what could be done. Since it was after the return policy, they told me to contact Asus...OF COURSE Asus then pointed the finger to Amazon.\n\nAfter all the back and forth and finger pointing, I finally get to send the computer in. put it back in the ORIGINAL box and sent in. quick turnaround on the repair(this is the only nice thing you will read). computer comes back in an oversized and mangled box. Turn computer on and still having connectivity issues. repair sheet said they replaced network adapter and also the HD. for some reason, between my house and their shop apparently the operating system quit...weird. Had my friend who is a network engineer look into my issues. we ran all kinds of tests and his conclusion was that it was a computer issue and not my network.\n\nMore complaining and requests for a NEW laptop, I get to send it in for a second time. Just got it back tonight and now they didn't send the computer back with the power adapter that was sent with it. It just never goes right. Do yourself a favor and buy another brand of computer. It has been 6 months of HELL with this company\n\nOnce again...I am not puting ANY fault to Amazon. they even offered to pay for me to take to a repair shop when they didn't even need to offer that. Asus is a bad company and product in every way.\n\nNOW... I am being told that I did not send a power cable which I know 100000% it was in the box.

Asus is new, I thought I'd give them a chance since they are on Amazon, the price was good, and I need a laptop for school. I'm sorry but it is already kinda cheaply made, and Windows 8 really ruined it. (BTW, if you just have to have windows 8, get a touchscreen or a tablet) The deal breaker was that when I went to plug in my mouse, there are no usb holes on the right side! (Not a problem if I were left handed.) Back in the box it went, after only having it for an hour. Found an 11.6 inch Acer, paid $150 more bucks for it, worth it because its just made better. and it had Windows 7!\nSorry Asus. I would invest in this as a very first computer for a visitor that is not from this planet, or an 8 year old. Perhaps their more expensive computers are better..."}

It isn't a top of the line machine, but it is more than capable of day to day mundane tasks, and unlike a Chromebook doesn't have an extremely limited OS. I was hesitant about the lack of optical drive, but got over it quick, I Haven't bought a movie on DVD or Blu Ray in over a year, and I can't think of any software that isn't a download and enter code system.\n\nI bought it for my son to start college with, I was going to get him a 14\" Alienware, Amazon Warehouse Deals had some great deals, but my son didn't want that, he wanted a basic machine, not something he would get tempted to play games on while in class, this machine fits the bill.\n\nI went through it and deleted a bunch of bloatware, but it doesn't seem like the bloatware was hampering performance much, and the HDD is plenty big enough that he wouldn't have missed the few extra GB it took up.\n\nSo far he has used Office and done some web surfing and movie watching on it, and it is more than up to the task.\n\nIt isn't a blazing fast computer, but it is not dog slow either. If you can pick it up at $219, you won't find a better deal on a new laptop, at $275 you might want to look for something with a Core i3 and an optical drive and maybe even another couple of GB of RAM for another $25."}

The ASUS X551MA laptop is perfectly built for students who need to load actual software on their computers for class and a Chromebook won't suffice.\n\nI am a huge fan of Chromebooks. My household has two of them. However, when the college student in your household brings home the laundry list of items they need for school, a slim, inexpensive full-function laptop may be top on the list.\n\nFor example, the local university's engineering curriculum requires students use Mathematica and a slimmed down version of AutoCAD. They can freely use the software on a terminal in the college's library or they can buy a student license to run on their own computer. Hence, buying the struggling student in my family this laptop for under $240 was an easy decision to make.\n\n*** FAIR WARNING *** Please check the technical requirements of the software you want to run on this machine to make sure it will work. I'm sure there are some highly specialized programs many students must use that require too much processing power for this bare-bones laptop. But as for MS Office, student versions of certain software titles, and the occasional game when its time to take a break, The ASUS X551MA laptop does the trick.\n\nBeing just under 5 lbs and less than 1.5\" thick, it doesn't add too much bulk or weight to a book bag or tote. This minimalist design is helped by not including an optical drive. So be aware, a DVD drive does not come with this laptop.\n\nAs a side note, I didn't like the hard drive only being 500GB. So, I spent an extra $40 on a Seagate portable backup drive. That and cloud storage, should be more than enough.\n\nI really like this computer. Under the hood lies really good hardware for the price in a sleek housing that seems moderately durable and relatively well built. I definitely think it is a solid buy as a great back to school gift for a college student or adult going back to school."}

It's a very slow processor. In speed terms, i would say it's around the speed of the core2duo.\n\nConnectivity wise it has two USB ports, there's one USB 2.0 and the other is 3.0. Luckily it has HDMI and VGA port so you can use your old monitor lying around and/or hook it up to your TV.\n\nThe bay is there for the optical drive, but maybe for cutting costs, it wasn't installed.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this laptop to someone who will really depend on it, this is more like a first laptop for a child, elderly, or as a backup.\n\nWho I would recommend this laptop to is to someone looking at Chromebooks, we all know they are not the best value, and you can always install any Linux OS on this laptop and it will run better than Windows 8.1 or any chromebook.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00L49X8E6", "review": "*Update 10/5/14: Well, about two and half months after I got it and the wireless adapter has crapped out. Wasted a couple of hours troubleshooting the problem and I am 99% sure that it is a hardware issue. I won't change my initial review at this point, but this could possibly be a sign of the long-term reliability. I'll update later.*\n*Update 11/1/14: Forgot ever making that update, sorry. The wireless adapter wasn't broken, I think it was an issue with the proxy software my school makes us install to use the university network. As a side note, I've since installed Linux (Ubuntu) on it as a second OS and it runs it beautifully without a hitch.*\n*Update 2/11/15: Still running strong. I've been using it with Linux almost exclusively for the past few months, so I've added a small write-up at the end of this review for people interested in that aspect.*\n\nThis is a nice budget laptop for students and/or people just looking for something to do basic computer tasks. I'm a student, and although I already have a nice custom-built desktop computer that I do most of my work on, I felt like I would benefit from having something portable to have in-class or while hanging out on campus.\n\nThis is, obviously, not a laptop for gaming. Out of curiosity I installed Skyrim on it and surprisingly it did run the game on low settings (albeit not with ideal fps) and it ran Minecraft fairly well (minor stuttering from time to time--but still definitely playable). If you're buying a laptop with the intention of gaming or any other intensive computer tasks I would highly recommend you look into the $500+ price range for a laptop with more capable specs.\n\nIn my case, it runs all the programs I needed it for: Visual Studio 2013, Eclipse, and other IDE's run perfectly fine. Word and other Office 2013 programs run perfectly fine. Browsing the internet with Chrome is perfect. Streaming HD video or playing a 1080p movie file is perfect. Unity3D (a game engine) and Blender (3d animation software) run acceptably. For $250 I really can't ask for anything more.\n\nPros:\n\nPrice: $250 for a brand new full featured Windows 8.1 laptop is insane. I would recommend one of these over a similarly priced Chromebook any day.\n\nExtremely lightweight: I was surprised when I took it out of the box at how little it weighed for the size--very easy to carry.\n\nQuiet and stays really cool: Even while testing out the gaming I didn't notice any sound from fans and even after using it for a while it didn't feel warm at all.\n\nNice design: Not a flashy laptop, just clean and non-descript aesthetics. Doesn't look like a high-end laptop but also doesn't look like a budget one. I like the textured matte plastic on the back. Screen hinge feels solid with not much play.\n\nNo optical drive: I know for some this is a con--but I can't even remember the last time I used a CD/DVD and would much rather have the savings on weight, power consumption, and cost. If you need to format and reinstall the OS or something just make a bootable USB stick (very easy to do).\n\nNice screen: The screen is bright with decent contrast and a 1366x768 resolution that's pretty much the standard for this size of laptop (at least until you get to the $600+ price range). I don't think it is LED backlit but it does its job well. *EDIT: The screen does have an LED backlight.\n\nNice keyboard with a number pad: If you're doing office work or programming it's pretty much essential to have a keyboard with a num pad. The keyboard as a whole is decent, no complaints except there's just the tiniest bit of rattling noise when tapping away. The trackpad is offset so that your hands don't rest on it when typing in a normal position.\n\nCons:\n\nNot upgrade friendly: There's no easy way to access the RAM, HDD, or even the battery. Although I really didn't have any intention of upgrading it so it's not a huge deal. This laptop is what it is and the slow-ish processor with low-end integrated graphics will always be this computer's bottleneck. If I need a faster laptop I'd rather just save the upgrade money to buy a new laptop.\n\nPower cord input is very snug: I guess this could be a pro, but where the power cord plugs into the laptop is so snug and secure that if you (or a pet) tripped over the cord it would certainly pull the laptop off the table before it came out. Makes me a little wary.\n\nNo light for caps-lock or num-lock: It has a power/charging light and an HDD activity light on the front and that's it. Wish it had an indication light for caps lock and num lock. Also, it sometimes doesn't seem to remember if num-lock is on when waking up from sleep etc. I find myself having to reactivate num-lock even though I'm positive I didn't deactivate it.\n\nTrackpad buttons: The left-click and right-click on the trackpad are a little hard to press for my taste and they are kind of noisy. Using the Asus Smart-gesture or whatever it's called makes it where you can just tap/double tap (or tap with both fingers to right-click) the trackpad to avoid using the buttons at all which seems like a better alternative.\n\nAll in all it's a decent and capable budget-friendly laptop with only a few minor gripes. I would definitely recommend it.\n\n***Notes on LINUX: I've been using this laptop with Linux (currently Ubuntu MATE) dual-booted alongside the pre-installed Win8.1 for several months and have found myself using Linux almost exclusively. Figured I'd mention a few things regarding that:\n*I have never been able to get the screen brightness adjustment keys (fn of F5 and F6) to work in Linux at all. The key to turn the display off works (fn of F7), just not the ones to turn the brightness up or down. I've read through tons of forum posts etc. trying to get it work but finally just settled on putting a little widget in the top panel to adjust the brightness easily on the fly. (Just want to note that I never had *any issues with the brightness keys in Win8.1)\n*Also regarding screen brightness--with one of the Ubuntu flavors I tried, I wanna say Kubuntu, the screen brightness would not adjust at all (control panel, manually through terminal, etc). I ultimately didn't feel like trying tons of fixes so I just went on with trying other Ubuntu *flavors.\n*UEFI boot: While all flavors of the Ubuntu distro will install just fine (and very easily) on this laptop without adjusting any of your boot settings in the BIOS, some other popular distros will require some extra steps. I tried both ElementaryOS and Linux Mint, but neither of them will boot or install while in UEFI. You can, however, boot to them and install if you switch to legacy boot instead (I explained how to do this is one my replies to this review). Downside is that if you still want to dual boot with Win8.1 you will have to manually switch the boot settings between UEFI and legacy depending which one you are booting to.\n*Battery life: I haven't done any real benchmarks yet, but the battery life using Ubuntu MATE seems significantly better than with Win8.1. When I have the time I'll look into getting some actual data on that.\n***"}
