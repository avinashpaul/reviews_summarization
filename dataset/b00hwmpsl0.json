From there I discovered I needed extra storage, and ended up going to three electronics stores before finally finding something at the Mircosoft store that would work. Fast forward to one year and one week after buying the tablet. I'd used it maybe a total of 15 hours. Maybe.\n\nIt had been sitting on my bookshelf gathering dust until I pulled it out to get it ready for our next trip. And you guessed it, it's dead. I plug it in for a couple days. Nothing. I research that maybe opening it up and re-setting the battery will work. I spend $10 to buy prying tools.\n\nNope. It's dead. I spent over $100 on a piece of gosa. Never again."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00HWMPSL0", "review": "Purchased for my 60+ year old not tech savvy at all mother and she LOVES it!\nI set it all up for her and mailed it to her (couple thousand miles away so I didn't just want to walk her through it over the phone).\nShe loves the size, it is easy enough for her to read, not too big, not too small and more importantly, not too heavy.\n\nThe only thing I wish I had paid more attention to was that it is a single rear facing camera. I installed Skype on it, only to discover there was no front facing camera. I missed that in the description when I purchased it, so I am not dinging any stars for it.\n\nOverall, is a great product"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00HWMPSL0", "review": "Just picked this up for my daughters birthday. As any dad would i took it out and started setting it up for her.\n\nI have to say i was impressed. I got it at walmart on closeout for $60 so i wasn't expecting much but after a couple hours playing with it I almost wanted to keep it for myself lol.\n\nFor comparison i have an S7 edge. The screen isn't quite as crisp but its definitely not bad. I watched a couple youtube videos on it and never found it lacking in any way. The size is perfect. Its twice the size of my phone so it makes everything so much bigger and easier.\n\nLoad response times were noticeably slower than my S7 due to the slower processor and less ram but then again my phone cost 10x as much a little bit of lag is totally ok.\n\nI kinda wish it had a front facing camera so she could take selfies n stuff but thats about the only thing i can complain about.\n\nLooking forward to having one very happy 8yr old when i give it to her this weekend. Maybe now she'll stop stealing my phone all the time. One can only hope.\n\nAll in all i would totally recommend this for anyone looking for a tablet for the kids. Thats where this one really shines. Its so much better than the \"made for kids\" ones they sell that don't do even half of what this does.\n\nIf you're looking for one for yourself tho... Id probably recommend getting one of the more expensive ones. I wouldnt call it \"slow\" but its definitely not fast either. Especially compared to what most of us are now used to with our smartphones. That extra second it takes to load a page seems like a lot when you're used to everything being instant."}

You can monitor their activity and put a usage limit on it. It allows 30 apps which is more than enough for my daughter and it comes with a few fun pre-installed apps.

Based on the answered questions on the product description, I assumed that the built in Android 4.2 operating system can be upgraded. Unfortunately, after spending many hours trying many different ways including calling Samsung tech support, there is no legitimate way to upgrade the operating system on this device to the recent 4.4 version. That limitation makes recent, specialized software applications incompatible. The second star is for Amazon's amazingly pain-free return process."}

He was extremely pleased by the quality and usability of the tablet. It will be used primarily for surfing the web and application use. The size is just perfect, and we got it in black, since I have the white already, we can tell the two apart. Samsung items have always been quality, long lasting devices, and I have had my tablet for six months, and it is still working like the day I got it. I have had my Samsung phone for around two years, and it still works great, with no plans of purchasing a new one, since this one is working so well!

I had planned on using it mostly with the kindle app, email and Web browsing. It was meant to be a starter tablet to see if I wanted to spend more money.\n\nLet me start off by saying that it is slooooow. Browsing cam be excruciating. I would tap on a link, wait, lose patience and go to my galaxy s5, tap the same link, get the info I needed and go back to the tab 3 lite only to see that the same page is still loading.\n\nAs far as kindle reading in the tab 3 lite worked just fine. The lower quality screen is a little tough on the eyes but I knew that going into it.\n\nAnother miss that I was willing to put up with is that often when I opened gmail I would have to sit there and wait for the page to load. Something which I was not used to with s4 and s5. Not a huge deal and I was still willing to overlook.\n\nIt was really the sluggish browsing that killed it for me. My s5 with a marginal signal performed better than the tab3 lite on wifi.\n\nI can't really account for other features as its back in the box."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00HWMPSL0", "review": "Many reviews state this is a good beginner's tablet, or good for a child, but it isn't good really at all for anyone.\n\nYes, it does function, and if you picked it up used or on sale, it might be okay to hold onto, but make no mistake, this is not Samsung's best gear.\n\nTo be brief, the main problem above all is the screen -- seriously, what you have read about the \"weak screen\" does no justice; the screen sucks. It's bad, really bad. You may think, well, it won't be that bad, but it IS that bad. The resolution is low and unclear, and the viewing angles are so narrow, you or your kid or whoever all excited trying to show a friend this funny video or something turns into a disappointing frustration as all that's seen an inch off center is a milky, faded, unclear image they cannot make out when right next to the thing. Dead center is wavy and the light sort of pulses, making clearest viewed center strain the eyes.\n\nIt's also slow in the hardware for the every day usage; Internet browsing is unresponsive, the pages load slowly as if broken, and the function for apps and the simple tools to adjust the thing are clunky and it simply feels like you're just struggling to get the thing sort of working so you can hand it back to whoever asked you to troubleshoot it. If it's actually yours outright and you're doing this work without being able to hand it off, you'll want to return it, as I did.\n\nThere is some good of course, like the touch response is great, and it does actually work unlike some of the cheaper, useless tablets sold as throw away electronics fodder in that $20 and $30 market at Walmart/Target and the like, but for a $150, it's just not worth it.\n\nDon't make the mistake, go look at something else; this one is sadly a dud."}

And best of all, the Google Store apps are as good or better than the equivalent IOS apps (this seems, at least to us, to particularly be true for Google apps such as Inbox, GMail, Chrome, Sheets, Drive).

It signed on the Internet with no problem at all. It was half charged when I took it out of the box so I gave it an additional 1 hour charge before I attempted to set it up. The next thing I noticed. This Samsung tablet is completely absent of \"Bloatware\". That was a pleasant surprise.  I have an Ipad as well. This Samsung is equally as responsive to touch as my IPad is. Yes I had to go to the Google Store and download Netflix, Hulu, Kindle and Facebook Apps but I would much rather do that than get a bunch of Bloatware I don't want that I would have to delete. The few games I have loaded work very well. I ordered a case from Amazon that will be here next week. All and all I am very satisfied with this purchase."}

This is my first Samsung product, I usually stick with Apple.\nI really like the texture on the back. It makes it easier to hold, a lot of times I feel that my iPad and iPhone are going to slide right out of my hand when I don't have the case on.\nI felt, going with a name brand product, that I would have similar quality to an iPad but this tab is a lot slower than I expected it to be. So far I've only downloaded a couple games to test it out but it takes 5+ seconds for the apps to open from when you touch them, this is something I've never had happen with with my iPad. It's not a huge issue, just an observation. The screen looks amazing and although it is a little on the slow side, I haven't had any real issues playing. It takes longer to switch levels in angry birds but the game-play is fine.\nI think that I prefer a larger tablet but for the screen size, it's easy to read. I've had a few issues where I've tried to click on one thing and it selected another.\nAll in all, it's okay. I mostly bought it for my kids to play with. I would recommend spending the extra and getting an iPad."}

But then there's the price.\nHaving had a tablet that had features akin to a moderate level tablet - HDMI output, for example - but whose battery now takes days to charge after about 3 years use, I knew which features I really used a lot, and which were quite optional.\n\"Light\" made better sense since I'm a very casual user with a particular range of not-very-demanding expectations, lightweight games, e-reader, email, Facebook, basic office-type programs, and some other convenience apps. I shouldn't spend over $100 if that's all I'm going to utilize it.\nThe battery is adequate; charges quickly and also discharges rather quickly. It sometimes knocks me out of apps for no apparent reason, and I've had to use its Restart feature to get good operability back after extended use, but those are pretty minor issues.\nIt's just fine for this lazy old booger in the recliner who is done with most of the day's office work, wraps up a few things, and plays a game, checks the scores, and then takes his e-reader to bed after setting the alarm to wake him up for another day in paradise."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00HWMPSL0", "review": "Let me start this out by saying I never thought I would own an Android tablet. Ever. I have been an Apple fan since 2005. Since then I have owned 2 iPods, 3 iPhones, 2 Macbook Pros, and 1 iPad. I'm extremely clumsy and constantly drop things. I accidentally dropped my first iPod down a flight of stairs and it still worked. I found Apple to be sturdy and reliable in their products... until now.\n\nMy iPad, or as I like to call it \"Sir Crash-a-lot,\" has been the tablet from hell. It worked great for a year but then it started dying. I've owned Sir Crash-a-lot for three years now. I have spent three years trying to save up for a newer iPad. But after saving for three years to replace Sir Crash-a-lot, I vowed to never buy an iPad again. Instead I went out and did something no Apple fanboy has ever done: I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab.\n\nWhat drove me to buy this tablet? Apple's unreliability. Sure, my iPad's apps ran slowly. Sure, the apps crashed a lot. But the final straw came when iTunes decided my Apple account should no longer be associated with my library, should be split into two parts (old email address & new email address), and should not be linked to my iPad. Oh, I should also mention iTunes deleted a ton of music I bought from my tablet because \"You do not have permission to access the following file(s).\"\n\nAfter almost 10 years of being an Apple fanboy, I went online and searched for Android tablets. Since I knew several people who loved their Samsung Galaxy phones, I went with the only tablet I could afford: a refurbished Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite. Shortly after taking it out of the box, I realized how great this tablet is. Even though the size was quiet a downgrade (I'm near-sighted and like to use my tablet without my reading glasses) I have had no problems reading text on it. The screen has better color than my iPad or my husband's iPad Mini. The screen switches quicker and loads faster than any iOS device I've ever seen. I love all of the customization that comes standard on Android. Even with all of its great features that I have grown to love, this tablet isn't without its problems. Most of the problems that come with it that people talk about is either the slow processor or the speaker being on the back. Neither of those are a huge problem for me. My biggest problem is the standard memory. Out of the 8gb, over 2gb are taken up by the operating system and the bloatware apps that I'll never use (and can't remove). After installing all of the apps I use regularly, I only have 2gb of space left. That's not much space. Thankfully, it has expandable memory. After I get a good 64gb micro SD card (my old one was corrupted), I plan on moving some of the big apps onto the card and putting my music library on it. The longer I have this tablet, the more I wish I bought it instead of an iPad for my first tablet.\n\nFor anyone who's looking at getting this tablet, you will need the following:\n1. An impact-resistant silicone case to absorb the shock of any falls the tablet will experience.\n2. A tempered glass screen protector to prevent the screen from breaking.\n3. A 64gb micro SD card to store most of your music, photos, and apps."}

The tablet was working fine and charging correctly at night, in the morning it would not turn on or charge. I took two pictures of the charging port showing there was no physical damage prior to shipping it to the repair centre, as I was expecting to be brushed off citing physical damage, as is common with consumer electronics. Willy insisted that there was no way their service centre could have damaged the unit and stated that it was \"obviously my fault\". I was treated extremely poorly and I still do not have my tablet back, however the service centre will fix it for a fee. When I asked to speak to someone else, I was told \"there was no one else to speak with\" which I find hard to believe that Willy is solely handling all of the Samsung inbound calls on his own. Buyer beware: Samsung does not honour their warranties and cites physical damage as a reason."}

I'm sure there are people out there who want a tablet for fancier stuff, and that's okay. Not sure how this one rates. But it's a lot more inexpensive than the others and it's a Droid, which I prefer. So, for me, it's perfect."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00HWMPSL0", "review": "I was about to send this tablet back as defective because, nearly every day, it would spontaneously and repeatedly reboot itself and the volume would automatically drop to zero.  It was essentially unusable.  Then, I noticed that the way it was sitting in my tablet stand, the power and volume buttons were at the bottom, and the weight of the tablet may have been causing the buttons to be pressed unintentionally.  I've since flipped the tablet around and have no longer had the auto-reboot and sound disappearing problems.\n\nThe tablet now works great.\n\nThe only slight disappointment I've found with this tablet is that, as mentioned by other reviewers, it does not have support for USB OTG.  So, I was unable to use an external USB keyboard that I plugged in.  I did, however, successfully pair and use a Jelly Comb Universal Bluetooth Keyboard Ultra Slim with this tablet.  Considering that this external keyboard cost less than $15 including shipping, I don't mind not being able to use the USB keyboard.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with this tablet."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00HWMPSL0", "review": "In November 2013 I purchased three Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lites.  Two for my kids and the other as a gift.  I haven't heard any complaints about the gifted tablet so I am assuming it is working well.  So my two children have one each.  One is working well whilst the other one started exhibiting problems straight out of the box.  The first problem it had is that it didn't stay connected to WiFi.  My other child's tablet would stay connected whilst one of them would be kicked off.  Then within 5-6 months of purchase another problem showed up. That it didn't charge properly.  The tablet would be left to charge for hours or overnight and later show that it only charged a few percent.  Anyway, in November 2014, the day before the warranty expired, the tablet shut down completely and I couldn't turn it on at all.  I couldn't do a hard reset or anything.  I contacted Samsung customer support who were very helpful, and because it was still within warranty I was given a tracking number and UPS label via email.  I sent it for repairs for free.  It was fixed for free and it was returned for free.  It even worked better than before it was sent for repairs.  However, that was about 3-4 weeks ago.  Then 24 hours ago the tablet started playing up again and it is back to it's old tricks and not charging properly.  The tablet was left overnight on charge (about 12 hours) and it only charged 9%. I'm not sure what to do now since it is out of the warranty period.\n\nOther cons about the tablet:\n8 GB is not a lot. The tablet comes with apps which take up about 4 GB.  So you only have 4 GB of useable memory.\nAnother time I asked Samsung customer support about downloading movies on to an SD card and I was told movies download to the hard drive due to copyright issues.\nNow I don't know if music and books also download to the hard drive, but if you want to download books, music and movies 4GB is not enough.\n\nPro:\nPrice is good.\nYou can expand the memory with an SD card, but that isn't useful if you want to save movies.\n\nOverall if you are looking for an inexpensive tablet this is a decent tablet, but do yourselves a favor and buy one with largest memory you can.  4GB gets used up pretty fast. Also, I hope you get a tablet that works!!! I own an iPad mini, my sister has had her full size iPad for three years.  My mother has had her full size iPad for two years, and we have never had a problem.  I'm not an Apple enthusiast nor do I work for them, my cell phone is an Android phone and I'm not looking to change it to an Apple phone, but if I cannot get my son's Tab 3 fixed for free (it is outside the warranty period) I would be very tempted not to buy a Samsung again."}

When you click to run the game the screen would black out for a period of time before returning to the home screen.  After returning it we bought a regular Galaxy Tab 4 and she couldn't be happier.

I went with this crap because it was cheap and they only needed them for internet and a few games. The tablets have been nothing but a headache since the day we got them. The charging port is very finicky and half the time the darn thing won't charge. It seems like you need to plug it in at just the right angle, in the right outlet and stand on your hear while holding it in to get it to work. You also can not charge it while it's on and you apparently have to power it down to charge. When it does manage to charge, which can take a whole day, it will only stay charged for 2 hours max. Most of the time it just shuts off and fails to turn on. The parental controls are also crap. With my Ipad I have the option to turn off \"in-app\" purchases and turn off the app store if I so choose. Not with the tab though. Nope, unless you put it on \"kids mode\" they can have the run and down load all that their little heart desires. If you do put it on kids mode good luck using most apps, and there is no internet option ether. If you do dare venture on the internet I really hope you are comfy and not planing to move any time soon because it's slow. Actually I think I have seen paint dry faster then I have seen a web page load on this thing. I'm actually thinking of returning them for a refund and going with the Kindle fire, I don't know how much more frustration I can handle."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00HWMPSL0", "review": "I purchased this tablet for a niece. I was looking for an inexpensive tablet with basic features that would allow her to surf the internet, watch Netflix, and play app based games. The setup process for this tablet was frustrating, it took over an hour for me to connect to the home WIFI. The was no button for easy connection to WPS, once connected to the internet the Google Play store kept giving me an error message. I ended up resetting the tablet and starting over. Even though this is a 7 inch tablet it is not the same size as a Galaxy Tab 3 (That is not a Lite version) This is important when searching for a case.\nOn the positive side, the picture quality of the Samsung Galaxy tab 3 lite is far better that other inexpensive tablets that I have viewed. Netflix or other streaming media plays without any delay. In addition to the Google Play store Samsung has there own downloadable apps. While there selection is very limited, I suspect it will grow over time. Like some of the other lower end tablets, I am able to search by voice through Google. The Camera is also capable of making videos and has an acceptable resolution. This tablet has a kid safe app included, so would be acceptable to use as a childs tablet. On black Friday, I was able to get an exceptional deal on this tablet through Amazon. I would recommend this tablet for a child, if you can get the product on sale, along with a sturdy case.\nThe difference between this tablet and other inexpensive tablet seems to be the display and picture quality."}

The wifi was unreliable, and worst of all, it would not install a Android app I needed for work, which was the very reason I purchased it.\n\nNow, I already own a 10\" Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, which I am VERY pleased with, but I needed something a little more portable to carry at work. Instead of purchasing the 7\" Lite which I really couldn't afford at the time, I went cheap and got the RCA.\n\nThis item, the Galaxy 3 Lite, is exactly what I need and does what it needs to do for my work, like running the company app, and everything else I would expect a mini tablet to do.  The memory is expandable with SD cards, up to 65gb.  The lack of a front camera doesn't bother me, and the single, back-facing speaker is not the best, but I prefer earbuds anyway.  Why disturb the people around you?  This would get a 4.5 star rating from me if I had that rating option.  Come on, Amazon, where are our 1/8, 1/3, 1/4 and 1/2 stars?  let's get more precise here!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00HWMPSL0", "review": "I own Samsung GT-P6200 Galaxy Tab (couple of years old).\n\nI was given a new Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite as a present few weeks ago.\n\nThis NEWER Lite version is much much worse than my OLD GT-P6200  tablet in EVERY category.\n\nSound is bad, you can't really enjoy playing music, video is not that good, I don't want to watch movies on it. When I tried to make my own video, it was all grainy, grey,  low quality, smaller size, not whole screen, sound was horrible, some cracking and scratching on the background. Photos are also no good. Just makes you upset when you try to make a picture of a beautiful sunset and instead you get something bleak and flat on the screen.\n\nIn general it is cheaply made. Even USB cable that came with it is shorter, cheaper,  and stiffer in comparison with the GT-P6200. No earphones in the box. No front camera so no video chat. Or turn it around and they will see you but you will not see them.  They tried to make it as cheap as possible cutting costs on every corner. Tablet has only three home screens and some kind of Android system with the simplified functionality.\n\nI don't know what to use this tablet for, maybe just to read books or to have it as an external hard drive. I keep it as a backup in case my regular tablet gets discharged. It doesn't break but it doesn't give you a real pleasure of using it either. Just an annoyance.  For its functionality I would price is around $50-$60 when new. It's more than TWICE OVERPRICED, it is no good even for a school kid.\n\nMy advice is to spend a little bit more money and buy something better."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00HWMPSL0", "review": "The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Lite is a decent tablet but could be a lot better.\n\nCons:\n- The resolution: While it's pretty good, it's not great. 1024x600 will not give you the bright, vibrant on screen colors that we've come to expect with today's tablets.\n- Outdated software: The tablet comes with Android 4.2, Jelly Bean OS. Being that as of 2014, the latest Android version is 4.4, Kit Kat, that is unacceptable for a device that came out this year.\n- The battery life is only average: Be prepared to possibly carry a charger around with you, especially if you're a heavy user.\n- Only 1GB of ram: This will make running many programs on this device slow it down quite a bit.\n- 2mp camera: Though I doubt too many people will be using this device to take pictures on a regular basis, 2mp is still low especially in this day in age. It's ok in a pinch though I suppose.\n- Rear speakers: This seems to be an issue with many Samsung devices. They love putting their speakers on the back so if the device is resting on a flat surface, the sound gets muzzled.\n\nPros:\n- Slim, compact and lightweight: Because of this, it makes this device very portable and easy to manage.\n- Good images and text: Despite the low resolution of the screen, images still look pretty good and the text is clear\n- Fast: Only provided that you don't have many programs running in the background. See above.\n\nDespite the affordable price, you might be better off with the regular Tab 3. This device is the \"Lite\" version so of course you will not get all of the bells and whistles and it may not run optimally because of it's low specs. However, if you're looking for a brand name, no frills tablet, this one is for you."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00HWMPSL0", "review": "This tablet will give you the basics that you expect from a tablet, especially if you are looking to do functions such as reading/sending email and viewing movies/videos. However, for the price, there are several features which are lacking. Because of the rear facing camera, you cannot use Skype with this tablet. And, even for watching movies, the rear speaker-only, does not do much for enhancing the audio. And, you cannot attach a keyboard to it (at least at this time). Even though it is less expensive than the standard Galaxy 3 Tablet, I feel it is still a bit overpriced, given the features/functions that it lacks. This tablet is light and compact, and if that is important to you, then this could make a nice second or \"travel\" tablet, or, perhaps one for younger children who do not need all of the features. Otherwise, I would recommend paying the few dollars more and going with the standard Galaxy 3 Tablet."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00HWMPSL0", "review": "Bought and returned.  Decided I couldn't live with the single speaker facing towards the back.  Picked up the Regular Tab 3 which has a better build, better components, a front facing camera and two speakers on the bottom.  You also get a much better screen. The screen of the Lite is of cheaper material and you can see faint horizontal lines built into the clear display. It kept developing streaks/smears on the screen (I believe due to the heat of the display) which I had to constantly wipe off.  The Lite also took forever and a day to recharge the battery.  The only thing I will miss with the Lite version is the Jelly Bean 4.2 OS which has gesture typing and the ability to store some apps on a external micro SD card.  The lite is priced too high and should go down once it's been on the market for awhile."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00HWMPSL0", "review": "The tablet has some nice pros going for it. It has a nice feel and it runs smoothly depending on what you do with yours. I use mine while waiting  - I ride with people sometimes and read and I sit in the bed and want to lounge - and thought it worked really well for that. I do have to say that I was really surprised by how thick it was when I first got it, then even more surprised by how well it handled considering how thick the item is. There's a light-weight quality to it that allowed me to use it easily, tilting it this way and that while goofing off - I mean testing it. I suppose that's what Lite means.\n\nI want to also note that I'm tech-savvy enough to utilize an item, but I'm not going to quote specifications. There are other reviewers doing that and they seem really knowledgeable, so they're a better option for that. I tried the item out and tested it in the real world, using it at the doctor or during breaks or on the go, if that helps any.\n\nI played a lot of applications for trial and the tablet ran smoothly, not having some of the hiccups I've noticed in other items when it comes to smaller games. There were a few issues when it came to some of the larger games I've purchased, with the requirements making me pause as it lagged it certain spots. I could adjust settings and control the issues, but there was still so lag. Playback on videos online was nice and movies played great as well, never once having an issue. To me this was a big plus. I also read comics on my tablets, and while a 7 \" screen is not the most optimal setup for it, the tablet does a great job with fill and with colors. That's always been an issue for me when using something like a Kindle - perhaps it has been fixed by now, but there was always a framing issue that bothered me. With this, no framing. You can always zoom on frames if so inclined to make up for a smaller screen, which I do with this one. I read a book on it while goofing off; the read went well as expected, which I didn't really doubt. Android readers have always done right by me.  Online use is good, no problems noted, with everything from directions to the restaurant to looking up random trivial working out.\n\nOther reviewers have mentioned the price, and that is one issue the tablet has going against it. It will get cheaper as time goes on, so while it is an issue while writing this, it won't be for long. Another thing is the 8 GB internal memory, but with the ability to connect a mini-SD to almost every device these days, it wasn't too much for me to consider for myself but something I felt worth noting.  I'm not a video-chatter so the lack of one camera does not bother me. I honestly have never liked a camera pointed at my face while using a device, but that's something you might want to look into if that is a selling/buying point."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00HWMPSL0", "review": "I've recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7 inch (the normal, non-Lite version), so it was fun to get to compare that to this Lite version.\n\nThe Lite is well built... it feels very solid in your hands, with a a textured back instead of the slick plastic back of the non-lite version.  I guess the textured back is less expensive, but it also is easier to hold and feels good in the hand.  The buttons for volume and standby feel solid and are easy to press (and to know they've been pressed).\n\nI like the design, too.  It's just the right thickness, and the bezel may be a bit wide but this makes it easier to hold.  With a touchscreen, it's annoying if I can't hold the thing without accidentally hitting the screen.\n\nThe screen itself has a good resolution, but the contrast is definitely not as defined as with the non-lite tablet.  This is noticeable when playing darker games or movies.\n\nTo test performance I installed a few games and played some HD movies.  For movie playback, this sucker is rock solid with no frame skipping I could detect.  For games like Airplane!, Radiant, Candy Crush, and Angry Birds, this tablet is great, with pretty visuals and a nice size surface for gameplay.  For Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas, with graphics set to maximum, the framerate was too low for easy gameplay.  On medium the game was largely playable, though the frames would suffer somewhat if a lot was happening while driving.  I found the game great to play on low graphics (which in my opinion look just fine).\n\nI find the performance of the tablet to be fine, but that's worth paying attention to.  For comparison, the regular Galaxy Tab 3 performed obviously better on GTA San Andreas on medium, but was pretty similar on max graphics.  There was no difference on less demanding games that I could detect.  Websites and movies all loaded great on both.\n\nFor other differences, it only has a 2 megapixel camera on the back, and no cam on the front.  Video chatting is a nice feature of the other tablet, but it's not a big deal to me to lose that feature.  In fact, if you have concerns about being spied upon, then you might even like the lack of a front facing cam.\n\nTo sum it up, a 7 inch tablet is just the right size for commuters or lounging on the couch.  Everything is easy to read,  and there's plenty of room for a screen keyboard, but it's also very easy to hold.  Surfing the internet or watching a video on this is great, especially when I ride a bus or train around town.  While it's watchable in full sun, the picture will wash out, due to the glossy screen and inferior contrast.  Battery life is absolutely fantastic!  About nine hours of regular goofing off, and about three-four of playing San Andreas (I keep going back to that because it's by far the most stress I can put on the device).  You get a Micro SD slot, so you aren't locked in to any content vendor or the space limitations of the device.  That alone makes this better, for me, than an iPad or many of the 'best' android tabs.  Swiping to type works great, and S Voice is very handy (though Google Now is great for its own purposes).  For example, I can set an alarm without fumbling through the menus, simply by double clicking the front button and saying \"set an alarm for eight hours (or the time I want)\".  That is so much better when you're tired and have taken off your glasses.\n\nAndroid's software library is stout, with a lot of awesome free software, a great browser in chrome, and awesome paid content too.  If you haven't had an android device yet, this is an affordable way to get some awesome stuff.  If you've only used it on a phone, you will be impressed with how your favorite apps look on a bigger screen.  A nice game on a tablet screen puts your old Gameboy days to shame!\n\nI did save a map and use this for navigation for a little while.  It did a great job, though I really don't need anything that big for the task.\n\nWhile there are better deals out there for a budget tablet, I really like Samsung's build quality and proprietary software (S-Voice, for example).  Is that worth the extra money (or alternatively the less powerful processor, depending on what you're comparing this to)?  I say it is, but with the current price I would go with the non-Lite Galaxy Tab.  I suspect that this product will be more affordable in the near future, so this is one to keep an eye on if you're just wanting an inexpensive way to read e-books and watch media.  Others may recommend a more generic branded tablet, which for the money will definitely get you more features and horsepower, but I've learned that the poor man pays twice with these mobile electronics.  Get the good brands, and you'll be ahead in the long-run."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00HWMPSL0", "review": "I purchased this tablet on Friday and returned it on Sunday. It has 8 GB of memory and the pre-loaded apps take up half of that. You cannot store apps on the sd card only pictures and music or other files. Great looking tab however I got the Kindle Fire HDX from QVC saturday night and it came with a quad 4 processor. I got 32 Gb of memory, a protective case, stylus and earbuds for 289.00 This is one of the best 7'' tablets in its class as of today. Samsung is a good company however the memory on the 7'' was not enough for numerous apps. All in all it is an individual choice of what you want the tablet for. happy shopping.  Amazon stepped up its game with the new KINDLE FIRE HDX."}

This tablet is a stripped down version of the Galaxy Tab 3.  Want to use SKYPE?  Sorry, no front facing camera.  Want to attach a USB stick, mouse or keyboard?  Sorry, no USB OTG support.  The tablet is extremely basic, primarily for tasks like reading and sending email, reading a book or magazine, watching Netflix or streaming music. The tablet works ok for what it is and I get about 6-9 hours out of the battery before recharge depending upon how I am using it.\nThe tablet will work well as a travel tablet, or one for the kids to use.  Just don't expect too much of it.\n\nCompetition:\n\nThe ASUS MeMo Pad HD7 costs the same as the Samsung tablet but has better screen resolution, faster quad-core processor, front camera, higher-res rear camera and is lighter.\nThe Lenovo IdeaTab A3000 matches the Lite in all aspects: display size and resolution, Android version, battery but adds a front camera, better rear camera, USB OTG and a more powerful processor at the expense of a little extra thickness and weight.\n\nAgain, not a bad tablet for the price, but there are other tablets available with better specs for the same money.  If this tablet were priced between $100 and $120, it would be a good deal.  At $150+, it's just too expensive for what you get."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00HWMPSL0", "review": "I have had the tab only a few hours and although everything is aesthetically pleasing and of robust construction I cannot reliably download apps and books because it drops the wireless signal every 60 seconds or so.  This is really strange because my S4 has a signal of 5 bars in the same room and my laptop is the same.  Neither of my other devices drops their signal, so this is a major concern.\n\nI am really hoping that there is something I can do - and that someone can tell me what that is since it is such a new device!"}
