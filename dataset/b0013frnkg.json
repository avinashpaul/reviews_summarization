{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "So after picking it up Friday and playing around with it most of the weekend, what's the final word? Seemless. If you had the first one and moved to the 2nd one, it's worth the move. I made a back up of the original and after going through iTunes everything just moved right over. Made a few tweeks here and there but otherwise it was painless.\n\nAs far as the size goes, it's definently lighter than the first one and it's really lighter than the XOOM, which I had a chance to play around with on Saturday. Also due to the size, it feels like it swims around in the original's case so you definently will want a new one. With the new case, Apple really wants you to show off the sleekness of the device which is cool, but you want to take advantage of having AppleCare in case you accidentally drop it and it breaks. When things get smaller and slimmer, it always tends to feel more fragile. My complaint about the exposure is the back of the iPad which I can see being scuffed in a few weeks so I may get something to protect the back of it. Otherwise, this truly looks like a slate.\n\nIt does feel speedier when loading up apps and as far as gaming goes, some like Infinity Blade and Shadow Guardian really gets a boost from the extra speed. They look much better and the loss of framerate is not as noticable as the iPad 1's.\n\nThere is however still a bit of barely noticable stutter in some movies shown via Netflix when streaming which makes me hope that the next gen iPad has the Retina Display or something better for true on the go HD viewing.\n\nThe cameras, while not the best ( I still don't see someone trying to do serious photography with this so this is not a big deal for me) still does very great with Face Time support. I demoed it a few times with one of my friends who also had the ipad 2 (as well as the iPhone 4) and people who has never seen Face Time in action were astounded. This was the video phone that we only imagined back in the 60s and 70s.\n\nThere is still no SD Slot, no Thunderbolt support however the battery still holds a charge ( I just charged mine for the first time last night) and the screen is more bright and crisp than that of the XOOM.\n\nApple has done a good job at taking the next step with the iPad and any competitor that had something coming out this year really need to take notes because if they don't move swiftly enough, Apple will dominate the tablet space in a similar fashion as they did the mp3 space with the iPod.\n\nIf you had the first one ther are a few small surprises that you are in for, if this is your first one, you will be amazed about what you have missed out on."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The Ipad2 is a great device but the same model is much cheaper elsewhere. This same exact 16 gig wifi sells for about $150 less at places like Best Buy and Apple's own website."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "For anyone out there who is considering whether or not to make the leap and purchase the iPad 2, this review is for you. If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.\n\nLet me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple \"fanboy\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.\n\nPhysical Characteristics\nThe iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.\n\nNew and \"Improved\"\nApple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.\n\nThe screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.\n\nThe addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.\n\nSmart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.\n\nMultitasking Support\nOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature. The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.\n\nApps\nOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap). The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.\n\nPros:\nWeight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.\n\nBattery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.\n\nBooks. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.\n\nCons:\nStill no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.\n\nStill no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.\n\nHDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.\n\nNo Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.\n\nIf you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2. If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet. I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1. I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI. While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets. With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors."}

If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2. If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet. I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1. I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI. While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets. With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "First things first: I consider myself relatively unbiased on Apple products. I received the original iPad as a gift (which I was able to return once I saw the iPad 2 announcement) and I have an old iPod 4th gen with color display which is still going strong after a few years, but aside from that I typically use Windows PCs and my phone is Android.\n\nIf you don't have an iPad, and you're trying to decide whether you want one or not, ask yourself: What will I use this for?\n\nThis is meant to be an overview for the uninitiated, since according to initial news reports, 70% of people who have bought the iPad 2 so far didn't own an original iPad.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nIf you want it for web surfing, a portable Netflix or other video screen, gaming, or FaceTime/Skype video chat, it's definitely adept at all of those things. I used to read books and magazines in my bed before going to sleep, and I still occasionally do, but now I've found that surfing with the iPad is just as convenient and relaxing.\n\nThe iPad is all about the apps, many of which greatly expand the native capability of the iPad. You can get Microsoft Office clones, remote desktop, second screen, calculators, alarm clocks, remote apps for cable boxes and disc players, and more. Some are free, many are not. I'll get into some of those a bit later, but keep in mind this isn't intended to be a review of apps. If you want to see what's out there, you can search the App store on the web or in iTunes. If you expect the iPad to be able to do something not in its specs, check the app store first.\n\nThe only difference I've seen with the iPad 2 is that now there are a few games out there that are optimized for iPad 2, or have improved iPad 2 modes. Lots of games are free and those that aren't occasionally go on sale. The only two I've bought are Scrabble HD and Dungeon Hunter 2 HD, both when they were $1 each. (I've played many more free ones.) I recommend both. Dungeon Hunter 2 HD is a great 3D game that tries really hard to be Diablo 2, with character classes, customization, and online play. It looks great and has never crashed or had a framerate stutter. The iPad 1 had problems with crashing and low framerates with games occasionally, and this version seems to be a much better gaming system. That's the only big difference I noticed between the iPad 1 and iPad 2 so far though.\n\nFor me, having a huge array of apps to play with, many of which are free if you don't mind ads here and there, and the convenience of being able to web surf without having to drag out my laptop makes this worth having. Plus the battery gets 8-10 hours on a charge, which is a far cry better than any laptop I know of. It's a great e-reader for airplane travel, even really long flights, though you can't use it on take-off and landing of course.\n\nWi-Fi performance is flawless and the range is excellent. More than once I've pulled up in the driveway and before I'm even in the house, I've heard my iPad's ESPN ScoreCenter app go off to inform me of a score. I can't speak to the 3G quality, though, as I don't have that model. Frankly, I don't think most people need it. If I'm out of the middle of nowhere and need the web for something, I'd much rather pull out my phone than the iPad. If you just have to use the iPad, tons of public places have Wi-Fi these days.\n\nIf you want to be able to print things, you might think at first that you need an AirPrint compatible printer. Fear not! A simple Google search for \"AirPrint any printer\" will show you how to configure your PC or Mac to broadcast its printers with AirPrint. I have Brother and Canon printers and they both worked with it. It took some time to download and install the AirPrint service and then configure printer sharing options on my network, but that was a far cry better than buying a new printer or an expensive printing app! Still, I've found that my printers occasionally disappear from the list, and the only way to get them back is to shut the iPad down completely and power it back on. Annoying.\n\nLimitations:\n\nThe iPad 2 still doesn't support Adobe Flash. Some websites are adapting to this and adding HTML 5 video. Many aren't. Keep that in mind if you're a heavy web video user. I love to watch web shows like the Nostalgia Critic and the Angry Video Game Nerd, and most web show hosting sites are still in Flash. Also, some sites have flash menus, making them completely unusable to you if they don't have a mobile version. It's this that prevents the iPad from being a true laptop replacement, regardless of how much you spend on apps. I still end up having to fire up the laptop to use several websites I enjoy.\n\nThe screen is supposedly oleophobic but gets fingerprints all over the place in mere minutes of use. I find that extremely irritating. If you feel the same way, get a screen protector like the ZAGG InvisibleShield (though if you get that particular one, be VERY careful when you install it, it's extremely difficult to get it on there with no air bubbles). You will thank yourself when all it takes to clear fingerprints is one wipe, plus it protects from scratches to boot. To get fingerprints off the screen itself took vigorous scrubbing and left streaks, which needed isopropyl alcohol to remove. Also, in direct sunlight, the glare off the screen makes it hard to see. Add fingerprints to that and it's practically impossible.\n\nAlthough the iPad 2 has two cameras, one on the front and one on the back, I haven't found much reason to use them other than for video chat. The cameras are terrible quality and the iPad 2 just isn't portable enough to drag around everywhere for camera usage. You can get an excellent digital camera for $150 or less, and most smartphones have much better cameras than the iPad has. Use one of those instead.\n\nIf you don't own a laptop, don't expect the iPad 2 to do everything a laptop will, especially if you plan on doing any work-related things. Office applications are not included. Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, which are like Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint respectively, are available for $10 each. I don't own them, but apparently they work reasonably well. However they are not 100% compatible with Microsoft Office documents, especially if you have more complicated formatting, macros, or animations that don't translate directly. Plus, the virtual keyboard is a bit more tiring to type on and definitely hinders typing speed. I average about 45-50 WPM on it, where I can get 80-100 WPM on a normal keyboard. You can be a little lazy with it to increase your effective typing speed, though; you can leave out apostrophes or required capitalization and the iPad will nearly always fix it. That also mostly takes care of my fingers occasionally hitting the wrong keys due to the lack of tactile feedback, but I still end up having to go back and fix words sometimes. Also, sometimes it fixes things that don't need to be fixed. It always seems to correct \"its\" to \"it's\", but what if I mean \"its\"? I know the difference!\n\nA lot of other features that you would expect a laptop to have are not here, though, or cost more. For example...\n- You can give slideshow presentations or display video on external monitors, projectors, or TVs with it, but that will cost you $29 for a VGA adapter plus the price of a cable and DVI to VGA adapter (monitors or projectors), or $39 for an HDMI adapter plus the price of an HDMI cable (newer TVs), or $39 for a composite or component video cable (older TVs)\n- You can transfer photos from a camera directly without having to use iTunes, but that will cost $29 for a camera adapter kit\n- The iPad is terrible at file storage for things other than music, videos, photos and apps, and with no USB or SD card slot, can't easily use external storage. If you want to store documents or need external storage for anything you'll need a file management app to keep track of them, and an online cloud file storage service like MobileMe (expensive) or Dropbox (free but limited to 2 GB, or pay for more)\n- Where you can just close a laptop to protect its screen, you'll need a case to protect the iPad. I highly recommend getting one. To save some money, try a cover/case intended for iPad 1, assuming you don't care that the rear camera will be covered up. A lot of them still fit and work great, such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Griffin-Elan-Passport-for-iPad-Black/dp/B003CKAQ7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Griffin Elan Passport for iPad - Black</a>, and since they're for an old model they'll be discounted\n- You can watch videos/TV episodes/movies on it, but unless you bought them in iTunes, it's a big fat pain to find a converter for them and transfer them to iTunes. This is especially annoying for DVDs/Blu-Rays that have digital copy. You've already paid for the movie and have a digital file but you can't transfer it to your iPad without having to jump through a ton of hoops or buying expensive programs or apps! Not all media companies have this problem, though. When you redeem a digital copy from Disney, you can choose to get an iTunes version, which is perfectly compatible with the iPad. I have Up, Toy Story 3 and Wall-E, and getting them on the iPad was hassle-free. Conversely, Warner Brothers only offers Windows Media versions of the Harry Potter series for digital copy. Transferring to iPad is possible but you need to find programs that remove the DRM, resize to iPad resolution, and convert to Quicktime format. Good luck with that.\n\nDespite all that, the iPad 2 is worth getting if you can spare the cash, and more importantly, if you anticipate actually using it. I don't think it's worth getting for games alone, but if you're a gamer, there are lots of great, cheap games out there. Many of them are even multiplayer, though I haven't tried it, since most of my friends don't have iPads and interoperability between iPad and iPhone versions of games is slim to none (board games like Scrabble and Carcassonne tend to support iPad/iPhone interoperability though).\n\nThe thing is, though, I got this as a gift. Would I have gotten it if I actually had to plunk down the $500+? Honestly, probably not. The lack of many features without having to buy expensive apps and accessories is a real deal-breaker for me (and subtracts a star from my rating). Plus, though I understand why Apple doesn't like Adobe Flash, they really need to get over it since there are large parts of the web that don't work without it. It may be bad for battery life, but why not just have the option to turn it on and off as needed, then? Still, if money is no object for you, it's a slick, entertaining device, and you'll enjoy it quite a bit. Just don't expect it to replace anything you already have; the iPad is in a niche market that the iPad itself created."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Great Quality, very good speed. Camera for facetime and web. best used in car and travel. Good for music. Very good sound."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "For anyone out there who is considering whether or not to make the leap and purchase the iPad 2, this review is for you.  If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.\n\nLet me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this.  I'm not an Apple \"fanboy\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.\n\nPhysical Characteristics\nThe iPad 2 is absurdly thin.  More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in  your hand.  One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time.  For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal.  Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device.  In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2.  That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day.  The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.\n\nNew and \"Improved\"\nApple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB.  What does that mean?  For most casual users, probably not a whole lot.  There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games.  If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements.  If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.\n\nThe screen is the same for all real purposes.  It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution.  The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next.  In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands.  I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive.  Try not to drop it though.\n\nThe addition of 2 cameras was expected.  Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras.  Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2.  The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images.  The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad.  For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone.  With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time).  FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon.  This is probably a good thing though.  It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.\n\nSmart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful.  Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations.  You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2.  It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.\n\nMultitasking Support\nOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support.  Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature.  The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well.  That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.\n\nApps\nOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability.  The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2.  The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses.  There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing.  Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap).  The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.\n\nPros:\nWeight.  Seriously.  The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion.  It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.\n\nBattery Life.  From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook.  That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.\n\nBooks.  This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way.  The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle.  This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same).  Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window.  If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.\n\nCons:\nStill no dedicated USB support.  While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage.  Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider.  The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files.  Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.\n\nStill no dedicated SD card slot.  This is troublesome on two fronts.  First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around.  Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage.  I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue.  If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.\n\nHDMI output.  Really this is a Pro and a Con.  The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter.  All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in.  This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.\n\nNo Flash Support.  This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games).  Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not.  If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.\n\nIf you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list.  If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can.  Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "So after picking it up Friday and playing around with it most of the weekend, what's the final word? Seemless. If you had the first one and moved to the 2nd one, it's worth the move. I made a back up of the original and after going through iTunes everything just moved right over. Made a few tweeks here and there but otherwise it was painless.\n\nAs far as the size goes, it's definently lighter than the first one and it's really lighter than the XOOM, which I had a chance to play around with on Saturday. Also due to the size, it feels like it swims around in the original's case so you definently will want a new one. With the new case, Apple really wants you to show off the sleekness of the device which is cool, but you want to take advantage of having AppleCare in case you accidentally drop it and it breaks. When things get smaller and slimmer, it always tends to feel more fragile. My complaint about the exposure is the back of the iPad which I can see being scuffed in a few weeks so I may get something to protect the back of it. Otherwise, this truly looks like a slate.\n\nIt does feel speedier when loading up apps and as far as gaming goes, some like Infinity Blade and Shadow Guardian really gets a boost from the extra speed. They look much better and the loss of framerate is not as noticable as the iPad 1's.\n\nThere is however still a bit of barely noticable stutter in some movies shown via Netflix when streaming which makes me hope that the next gen iPad has the Retina Display or something better for true on the go HD viewing.\n\nThe cameras, while not the best ( I still don't see someone trying to do serious photography with this so this is not a big deal for me) still does very great with Face Time support. I demoed it a few times with one of my friends who also had the ipad 2 (as well as the iPhone 4) and people who has never seen Face Time in action were astounded. This was the video phone that we only imagined back in the 60s and 70s.\n\nThere is still no SD Slot, no Thunderbolt support however the battery still holds a charge ( I just charged mine for the first time last night) and the screen is more bright and crisp than that of the XOOM.\n\nApple has done a good job at taking the next step with the iPad and any competitor that had something coming out this year really need to take notes because if they don't move swiftly enough, Apple will dominate the tablet space in a similar fashion as they did the mp3 space with the iPod.\n\nIf you had the first one ther are a few small surprises that you are in for, if this is your first one, you will be amazed about what you have missed out on."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The Compromiser\n\n  If you're someone who wants the name brand quality of Apple, but does not want to spend hundreds of dollars on a new IPad, then this is the ideal product for you. It can do everything that a new version can do, but costs under 100$ used. Also, If you have any other Apple products this is will be a lovely addition to your collection. You can sync it with your Mac, IPhone, or Apple watch and have all your apps and information together synced on the same cloud. It is perfect for the Apple aficionado on a budget looking for the best compromise between performance and price.\n\nTech Specs, Battery Life, and Durability\n\n While it may only be the second generation Ipad, it still has the very fast processing power of 1.0 GHz and 512 MB of RAM. You will not even notice you're using an older generation Ipad because it can also handle current ios software. It comes used, meaning it has a few minor scratches on the back, but this is not an issue if you're going to buy a case for it. With the case it looks, feels, and acts brand new!\n Even without the case this Ipad is extremely durable and can survive the wear and tear of life. You will notice it does not scratch easy as only the highest of falls or the deepest of cuts will penetrate its outer exterior and touch screen. The battery life is excellent as well; you can expect it to last all day on a nightly charge. Apple tech specs state that this device has a battery life of ten hours, and this is continuous usage of surfing the web, streaming, or playing music.\n\nFinal Considerations\n\n It comes safely sealed in custom made protective bubble wrap, therefore you can expect it to arrive safe and sound on your doorstep in two business days if you're a Prime member. It is not the biggest or the fastest Ipad to date, but buying used saves you anywhere from $400-$500 if you bought it new. Not only do you save hundreds, you also can do almost everything that the newer generations can do. If you're looking for a device for basic tablet uses such as streaming, surfing the web, listening to music, using apps, making Face time calls, checking email, etc. this Ipad will do it all."}

I am very happy with my ipad.\nWould purchase again. Love it."}

Had to bring it to the Apple store to reboot it and then the iPad had an activation lock on it from the previous owner. The only way to unlock it is by either contacting the previous owner and hope that they are willing to share their Apple ID and password with you. Which, for the record, no one will do. The alternative is issuing a hard-reset, which requires a valid proof of purchase (i.e. receipt with serial number).\n\nWhen you purchase a device from this retailer, they will NOT issue a receipt with a serial number. There is no way to know for sure whether the device you buy is stolen, repurposed or marked as lost. When you receive an iPad that is stolen, scrapped or lost, it will become completely useless to you and you will have wasted $270. Just don't do it.\n\nDigitBargain has a simple return policy; they don't do it. Aside from the 'sketchy' their device management practices, their customer service is equally useless. They barely speak English and completely fail to understand any issue you may experience. As a matter of fact, they have actually stopped responding to my emails. I am very surprised that this retailer is allowed to sell on Amazon, I thought there were standards.\n\nAnyhow, I received a nice $10 promotional code from Amazon for my 'inconvenience' and unfavorable experience. Thanks, Amazon!\n\nDid I mention that you should not purchase an iPad from this company? Well, you shouldn't.\n\n- MK"}

The screen size and picture are so much better. The cameras work well and it is great for games,even more demanding ones like asphalt 8. The newest iOS the iPad 2 supports is 9.3.5. With that being said you can still get almost every app still and it works like the newest models. You can save so much money buying the 2 instead of a newer model. This is better than even Samsung,this is the best tablet ever! This tablet is so great I am using it right now to leave this review!"}

I was disappoined in two things, though.  This iPad doesn't have retina display(my old one did), and the ad for the iPad wasn't at all clear on this issue.  Other than that, the battery of this iPad continually loses its charge if you put the brightness all the way up.  My old iPad didn't do this either.  Overall, though, I'm happy to still be able to have access to a decent iPad, without having to shell out another 300 bucks."}

Although it's an early model (2nd generation) it contains updated software so is compatible with every app I want to load. The camera also is amazing, considering this was the first iPad to have a camera. It's all in the software updates, which are truly awesome.\n\nHad a small issue when, on day 2, the iPad stopped working and began to ask me for a passcode. I have an iTunes password, but it wanted a passcode. The former owner must have programmed one in and I could not get around it. Contacted the seller, who emailed me directions on how to restore the iPad to factory settings, and it has been working perfectly ever since.\n\nIf you are choosing between getting an inexpensive tablet or a used/refurbished iPad, don't hesitate to do the latter. Apple quality can't be beat. And although the seller did not state that this model was \"refurbished\", it was stamped as such when it arrived. Highly recommend!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Would you like a device to cruise Facebook, play some mobile games, or check email? Don't get this one.\nThis iPad is so laughably bad that you'd be better off doing any of those things on your mobile than this thing. Go ahead, cruise Facebook as long as you can before it crashes. Get lucky and find some way the app won't crash? Don't worry, if you find something you want to click on--a video, an article, or even a post you simply want to read all of--this device will find a way to crash it.\nYou may be thinking: \"well, maybe it's the app and not the device.\" Wrong. Open the settings app and watch it crash; open Netflix and watch it crash; hell, open a jigsaw puzzle app...and watch it crash. They all crash.\nBut worry not! Apple has just the fix. You will only need to update the OS software 3 times per week. None of which will fix any of the app issues, but will allow Apple to say you agreed to mandatory arbitration 3 times a week for years.\nBesides all the app problems, this thing is stupidly slow. This is now an older model, but having been gifted it when it was new, I'll tell you it was always like this. I like to use a four-digit pass code for my iPad. Sometimes, this device will take damn near 30 seconds to load the numbers I hit and unlock the device, only to lag and not allow me to scroll between screens.\nWant to turn the screen to landscape view? Sorry, you'll have to shake it to recognize the change, making you look like you're having a seizure in the meantime. Don't want the screen to rotate because you're in the middle of something? Sorry, only when you don't want it to rotate will the slightest direction change make the screen rotate.\nI give 2 stars only because sometimes, when the device isn't being a bigger pain-in-the-rear than Donald Trump, it can be a joy to use. But remember, turn off all the things that make this device worth having; background app refresh for things like email, high-quality videos because the device slows down, way down, and social media apps because reasons.\nI would recommend an old roadkill shovel over this device. Suck it Apple fan boys."}

There a clue how this review will go:\n1) the wifi adapter was NOT working, had it trying to connect to multiple devices, wifi @ work, hot spot (T-Mobile), home wifi. It would sometimes briefly connect then drop as if stick in search mode, it would not stay connected. I had it sitting next to the hot spot and it showed 1 bar reception. Take a literal 3 steps away and it sees nothing...\n2) Seller tried to tell me she got on Netflix with it before she sent it, I have the emails from her. Uh, no liar you didn't do that. I'm a programmer, I checked. Who are you fooling?? Is that a believable story to you??\n3) The glass screen was not properly installed, the rubber seal behind it was coming out of the body (you shouldn't see this at all) and it literally had 2 HAIRS IN THE SCREEN!! What the what?Eyelash length, and disgusting. Furthermore, I could literally put a sheet of paper between the screen and body of the iPad on one corner. If I could upload the images from my phone I would (no option to). Just like people seeking attention who tell you they are \"crazy\" are not (and we know that), this \"honest and strait forward\" seller is far from her opinionated self-title.\n\nI did get my money back, but I always see justice through (meaning it was a process). I'm not the type of person others get over on. BUYERS BEWARE."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "A friend bought my wife an iPad 2 as a present. I was amazed at how skinny this thing is - but there is a downside to this as well. First the good: light weight, skinny, and we opted for the wifi only model so we wouldn't worry about a monthly cell bill. My wife had a korean chat/email/talk program put on it, and she enjoyed that function of it. The camera function was also fairly neat, especially when she figured out how to zoom in and out of the pictures.\n\nThe downsides: the skinny construction makes this very fragile when dropped. The first time, we thought it was broken forever, (just a black screen, and wouldn't turn on) before I looked online and found a fix: place it face down on the floor and kneel on the back of it. The second time, the screen was a grainy pixeled red. tapping it on the back changed the red to green, and then went black. So it is apparent that one or more cables or chips are knocked loose inside.\n\nThe skinny size also has a second downside - you have to hold it somehow, and if you grip it around the edge of the screen, you can keep the touch screen from working properly if you don't notice your thumb touching the glass front. And of course if you just rest it in the palm of your hand, it is prone to dropping. It also has a nice yet annoying feature of auto-rotating the screen depending on its orientation - I ended up having to turn this off so my wife wouldn't throw it through the wall.\n\nApps are installed through the official Apple app store, which pretty much requires you to setup an Itunes account, so you lose a bit of your privacy there, and you are limited to what Apple decides you can put on your iPad, unless there is some secret way to root the thing.\n\nAll in all,the iPad 2 turned out tt be a mixed bag - looks beautiful, with lots of neat apps to keep you busy, but darkness lies beneath the surface. For official repairs at an authorized dealer you can also expect to pay between half of the original price and the full price - lovely. Throw in the limited competition forced by the app store and the erosion of your privacy, and the design itself pretty much guarantees the average consumer will be throwing additional money towards repairs."}

I filed it down some as it was catching the skin, very sharp. It's an older Ipad so it's not as responsive and quick as the new ones. But still a great product. For the price I'm very pleased!

Two versions have\n succeeded the iPad 2. It's more wise to spend a few thousands more and go for\n the iPad 4 which will come out soon.\n\nThe iPad 2 or any other iPad for that matter, is a great companion, a fun device which you can buy if you have extra money to spend.

I have not upgraded my iPad 2 to iOS 9.3.1, due to the iCloud actviation problems and won't upgrade to a new software on this device anytime soon. Features you have on the iPad 2 are these\n1. 720p Camera\n2. FaceTime\n3. Photo Booth\n4. Safari (Internet)\n5. iTunes Store\n6. Apple App Store\n7. YouTube app (iOS 4.2.1 to iOS 6 on iPad 2)\n8. Game Center\n9. Photos\n10. Mail\nand more!\nIf you are going to buy this iPad model, Siri and voice dictation aren't features and you're stuck with having to type. Anyway, this iPad is great if you are using it for simple purposes only, such as searching the web, taking photos/videos, playing games/using apps, and listening to music."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Like all smartphones and tablets, the whole front of this is glass. Don't drop it on a hard surface and not expect the screen to shatter. After a few years of abuse, mine finally did.\n\n I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock. As a matter of fact, I was anti-apple for years. I finally jumped over to the iphone recently. I believe using this ipad had a lot to do with that decision.\n\nThe white seems to be better on the eyes than the black. My 1st gen, was black. I feel more fatigued when looking at that screen for long periods of time compared to this white one. The iPad 2 is pretty thin and light. I like its tapered edge, which feels more comfortable than the bulky original ipad. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done a pretty good job at fitting better components into a smaller space than before. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, but the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation is heavy and bulky compared to the 2nd gen."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "My 1st issue is that the plug & charger were a joke. The Lightning charging cord wouldn't insert in either direction & on my 3rd try it went 1/2 in & broke as I pulled it out. I went to Apple Store & spent $19.95 for a cord. Then I tried to plug the board into the plug it came with & it didn't work at all.  Fortunately I was able to use the new cord w my iPhone plug.  SO - one of the main reasons I decided to buy this refurbished ipad2 from this vendor was that I could save all the expense of buying chargers - Nope!  BTW, the cord & converter were both brand new, cheap knock off brands.  As far as the refurbished iPad2 - it's ok I guess.  It looks new, clean screen & it is exactly as described - it's good for email, internet search, pintrest, YouTube - I'm not a gamer so not sure about that.  Takes a long time to charge (several hours) & gets very slow if I have too many apps - so I deleted FB app & a few others. I wish I had bought something newer w hi-resolution, but this is ok - except the charger thing wasn't cool.  Don't let ur buying decision be based on that - just plan to go buy them at Apple Store or use ur iPhone charger if it will fit."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Pros: light & thin (impressively thin), great battery life (10 hours of use as advertised), screen is big, clear, and sharp.  The guts (cpu, ram, etc.) are quick and stable.  Sensitivity is great.  With a full wrap case, it responds to every touch.  Sturdy and durable, but with a case it's even better. Love this thing (and no I'm not an apple fan boy, used to be anti Apple but products like this got me hooked!)\n\nCons: speaker.  The speaker is pointed away from the user.  Which makes it quite for the user and louder for everyone around th user.  Need external speaker for music and what not, and head phones if you are planning to use it while others watch tv or whatever.  Also the storage is sort of small.  I'd say it's worth the extra $ for a bigger hard drive.  64 is best value, but the 32 is decent.\n\nThis IPad is fantastic!  Insanely thin, yet still very sturdy.  Screen is sharp, and clear.  As to its size, it's as big as I can be, and still be portable.  Comfortable and big enough for adult size hands, yet still small enough for my 6 year old to use.  Extremely light! And the battery life is great.  I didn't believe that it would really have a 10 hour battery life as advertised, but I sit here corrected.  The battery is no joke and really gives you 10 hours of actual use.  My only hang up (with all I (pad, touch, phone etc.) is the speaker.  While it produced sharp crisp sound it is pointed away from the user.  This diminishes the volume levels a lot as far as what you hear while using it, while it is extremely loud to any one sitting around you.  If I want to watch something or play a game while my wife is watching tv, I have to use head phones.  The sensitivity on the touch screen is perfect.  Not sure yet if you can adjust it or not, but it's at a perfect level just the way it is.  It is sensitive enough that with a full case/ screen protector it reacts to every touch still.  I would recommend strongly to buying a great quality full protection case, and decent external speaker, and a good set of head phones.  As far as storage, the 32 gig should be the minimal.  I can fill up 16 gigs very quickly, so it's worth it even for casual use to get something bigger than the 16 gigs.  64 gig is the best value, but the 32 is still respectable.  So far so good.  I love this thing.  Bought it for my son, but fell in love with it.  Buying a second one for myself!"}

Granted I never went past IOS 6.1.1, so I don't know how well it works with the newer IOS's, But I can say that it is very decent with what I have now. Not only that but the battery is holding out okay so far, it may not last a week a charge as it did before, it may be that I use it more heavily now, but even so it still lasts between 9-15 continuous run hours."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I recently bought the I-pad 2 in order to attempt to keep up with school. It offers fantastic apps for keeping up with school as well for entertainment. The device also offers great battery life as well as portability\nThe I-Pad is backed by the app store which is the central hub for application developers to create some incredibly useful tools. The app store shines when it comes of ease of use. Instead of having to go through pages on internet to find a specific application that I need I can quickly find them through the app store and they will be supremely cost efficient as well.\n Allowing application developers an open platform to present some of their amazing ideas doesnt only assist with school; it can also lead to fun and often addictive forms of entertainment. The I-Pad comes backed with apples I-Tunes giving you an infinite selection of music to download and play. If you don't want to pay the small fee either you can download other applications that allows you to listen to music for free. They also offer a wide array of movies that are played with excellence 10 inch screen size.\n The I-Pads versatility is not to be overlooked either. Its compact size allows for great portability without needing a laptop bag or anything to big. . Its battery life is incredibly long lasting me 2 days at times without a charge using it in almost every class and studying from 8 AM to 6PM. Though I do recommend that you should put some sort of protective case over it because it can be quite fragile. There is an also an issue presented that if it does run of battery that it may actually stay off and won't turn back on unless you do a factory reset. This means you lose all of your data but with cloud storage this doesnt pose that huge of a problem.\nThe I-Pads few glitches pale in comparison to the benefits this product can offer. For a student like myself it has been one of my main tools for studying, doing homework, or taking notes in class. The seemingly endless list of applications and songs offer unlimited entertainment as well. The portability and batter life only add to its ease of use as well."}

After much research, he conceded to trying out this apple iPad 2, and in fact decided to order 2 since it was so well priced and so that he would not have to share his with me or the kids. :)  We both LOVE them.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I bought the 64GB Wifi + AT&T 3G model in white (marketplace seller was Vius). I was a bit skeptical about receiving a new piece for $359 given that the original IPad 2 models are priced much higher.  I did receive what appears to be an authentic, new unit and it seems to be working well so far. Mine came with IOS 8 and I upgraded it to IOS 9. The only oddity is that my units model number is FC984B/A whereas the seller advertises the model as MC984LL/A. So, I am not sure what exactly I got. When I google the FC984B/A model to see details, the only result I get is on amazons UK site. I am hoping this is not some rejected series in the Apple production line :-( So far, so good though.\nWill update this review if I run into any problem."}

Recommended for your toddler, they love these things, and it will get your phone back from him or her.

It came with an Apple phone charger instead of a tablet charger which took it a whole day to charge to 100%. I had to pay $30 at the Apple store to get the right charger for it on top of what I had already paid for the iPad. Other than that I was happy with the purchase. The iPad itself was almost brand new."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I decided to buy the apple I pad 2 tablet second generation. I use the Internet frequently and walking around with my laptop was too much.  I decided that buying an I pad would be easy on the go.\n\nIve had apple products in the past; the programing has always worked perfect because its easy and simple. I have had previous apple product break easily. So, buying the product put me a little on edge. However Ive had the devise for about five months and I haven't had any problems with it. I have younger sisters who frequently play games on it and theyve dropped it several time. It still in perfect condition, I bought a case for it and they are extremely affordable compared to retail price.\n\nIve enjoyed my I pad because its easy to use. I bought one of the oldest versions of the I pads; however, being able to update helps me with what I need. The only big difference I see with my older I pad compared to the newer I pads is that its heavier and the picture quality isn't the best. I bought the product used, but in perfect condition. If you're looking for something simple and to get the job done, I pad 2 generations will do it!\n\nDelivery\nMy I pad took a longer than expected to arrive; however with Amazon you can easily track your orders so you know where it is at.  The delivery date was only a couple days later. Also, Amazon has a great return policy if the product doesnt work."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "If you are international students who are considering to purchase the first tablet, this review is very useful! It is because I was in the same situation like you two years ago, and now I am very glad that I purchased the iPad.\n\nUnlimited Books Can Be Purchased From Anywhere\nAs an international student, I believe you wished that you could read more books in your first language. An iPad will solve your problem! When I started using it for the first time, I was skeptical about reading books with the tablet. However, surprisingly, it was very easy to read. The size of screen is big enough and the size of fonts can be adjusted so that it was so much more comfortable to read books on iPad than on iPhone.\n\nThese days, I even believe that reading ebook on iPad is more convenient than on paper version because most of books can be purchased online, and they are cheaper than the paper version. Once books are purchased, all of them will be downloaded on your iPad permanently so that you do not need to carry many books from your home country any more!!\n\nGreat Support for Classes\nHeavy reading assignments are challenging for international students. However, my iPad has been very useful for those assignments. For example, if there is an unfamiliar vocabulary on a homework PDF file, iPad gives you the translation of the word by simply touching it. Therefore, you can keep reading the file without guessing the meaning of unfamiliar words. In addition, since iPad is quite light, and the battery lasts about 10 hours without charging, you can access to reading materials anywhere and anytime. Because of this portability, you can read assignments in a small portion at a time instead of reading files in front of a computer for many hours.\n\nI have been using my iPad every day since I purchased it, and I cannot imagine my school life without having it. This is how much my iPad helped my college life and that is why I am giving 5 stars for the evaluation. If you want to read books in your first language or have difficulty of reading assignments, I highly recommend you to purchase the iPad. It is a powerful tool to change your college life dramatically. By using it, I hope you will have a wonderful time studying overseas!!"}

The previous two versions of iOS updates made this model of iPad sluggish.  How would I know?  We have four different iPads at home.  However, the latest iOS 9.0 has made this iPad very responsive again.  My wife couldn't be happier.  The 3G also works great.  Instead of using my iPhone 6 plus, we find the larger screen much easier for us to see when we travel.\n\nThis high quality well made iPad is a gem and it is highly recommended.

We needed to replace our son's iPad 2 (assistive technology) and it was cheaper to replace it with the same thing than buying a latest-generation one and having to replace all his accessories with it.\n\nOne thing to note - this doesn't particularly matter in our case since we're not adding it to our cellular services - just using Wifi when needed - but when ordering I got to choose either Verizon or AT&T; I chose Verizon and it came with AT&T instead.  If we had needed to add the device to our services, I don't know if I would've needed to return it or what."}

Bought an inexpensive kid-proof case (from Amazon) in bright pink so the tablet is easy to find and relatively indestructible.  If the seller reads this, he will cringe to discover his pampered i-pad has become a kid's toy, so he may be pleased to know that I downloaded all my kindle books onto it and my wife has read a couple of them so far (even though she has a Kindle Fire and Kindle unlimited subscription).

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "As many of you know iPads generally aren't cheap. So when I found this one at such a good price, I found it a little odd that it was so cheap, but it was a deal I simply couldn't pass up. BIG MISTAKE. The product was defective from the moment I got it, but after syncing it with iTunes and several hours of work I finally got it to activate. After that it worked fine except for a few minor bugs, but I generally never expect an electronic device to work perfectly. But after several months it started shutting down until finally it collapsed altogether. I took it to several repair stores, but there was nothing that could be done. I tried to return it, but the return date had long since expired. Finally I resorted to mailing it back to Apple. I was given a replacement product, and have been extremely happy with it. I beg you save your time and money and avoid this seller at all costs. The iPad is absolutely great. The seller......not so much."}

I am extremely happy with this purchase and for the reasonable price!  I found out it does not come equipped with a SIM card. Also, if you run it off of wifi, you don't need a SIM card. I called AT&T they explained that you don't necessarily need a SIM card. If you want to pay for monthly service, they will give you a SIM card for free. Prepaid monthly service  is about $50/mo. Then you would have wifi while roaming. Overall, pleased with my purchase and definitely money well spent.  -Julie P  Hartford CT"}

Because it is an older version it doesn't have the capacity to hold some of the games we would play on the phone or other tablets.  It pretty much serves well for emails, or watching Netflix.\n\nThat is not to say the newer version of this product wouldn't be amazing.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Better than expected! I bought this item used for roughly $172 with tax. The item was \"acceptable,\" but it's near perfect! Nothing is wrong with the iPad's inner workings. The screen is completely free of scratches. There's only one tiny dent in upper left hand corner. However I expected worse so I'm very pleased! And I couldn't care less as long as it works. Seriously, there is no reason to buy this item new. You can get a terrific price here on Amazon. Get a brand new Air if you need it to be new. I will add that this iPad2 is running iOS 8 very well (if anyone happened to be worried). I am somebody who doesn't need a fancy camera or screen on a tablet. If you agree, do like I did and get a good deal by buying used!"}

The iPad is a great tool for communicating, running apps, surfing the web, and reading email.  I do wish apple would have included siri with the iPad.  Hands free interaction with the device would have been helpful on the move.  It could have been so much more.\n\nI run numbers, facebook, pages, and instant messaging on the iPad.  I like iMovie editing and found the software to be very reliable on the hardware.  You will need to buy ear head set to listen to music.  The built in speakers are not very loud.  The microphone is adequate but not great.  I found the dragon voice recognition system made too many errors to be useful.  I use webreader to listen to my stories.\n\niPhoto is great.  I wish it could find people by voice command.  This is a feature I look forward to using.\n\nEmail interface is great.  You send alot of time tapping to remove obsolete emails\n\nNo viruses.  Yeah\n\nIBooks works well on the iPad.  I wish that iBooks was capable of reading your ebook\n\nMicrosoft remote desktop works on the iPad2.  I wish that rd worked with a tap interseption capability rather than a drag and arrow click.  It takes time to navigate.\n\nthe iPad 2 screen is ok.  It smears easily.  A new nano material that resists smearing needs to be developed."}

Tried restore and every other suggestion on Apple site.  Nothing.  Year and a half volume control went out with volume at zero.  Only way to hear is via headphones.  2 years after, completely dead. Will not turn on.  When I do a Restore, it goes through the process but stops at the registration and shuts down.\n\nNow, I know some are thinking that we are hard on this iPad, perhaps, but that assumption is incorrect.  My mother, a senior citizen, uses it for word find puzzles and to facetime me.  If you want something that will last temporarily, buy this.  If you want something reliable to keep for a while and get your moneys worth, don't buy this."}

However, now that I have upgraded to the iPad Air, I see that this one is out of date now. The functionality of it is great for everyday use, but if you want an HD tablet that runs like lightning, this one is not for you. It is very heavy compared to newer iPad models and the screen is not nearly as scratch resistant.\n\nOverall, this was a great tablet in it's day but can't compete with the newer generations. The price is still very high, I would recommend the iPad mini over this model."}

They've made a lot of people very upset."}

Not only is it beautiful, it is also lightweight and feels so premium when held. I, myself couldn't believe that I owned an iPad as I've wanted one since it initially released.

I bought this iPad because I needed a tablet that I could use for general college use and watching streaming video.\n\nAs of today, it's my 4th day with this tablet and I enjoy it! I bought it off Amazon, used, in \"Acceptable\" condition. Because it was used there was a significant discount, but of course I felt trepidation. I worried that it would arrive cracked, or otherwise in substandard condition. However, when it DID arrive the only nicks were minor and near the charging port, as well as some tiny sticky residue on the back (like someone had removed a sticker). Everything else was working fine: the home button was responsive, the speaker and microphone functioned well, and after a brief syncing with my iCloud, all my photos and contacts were imported with relative ease. There was a charger included as well!\n\nThe tablet is lightweight and intuitive. Of course, I am buying a case and screen protector to keep my investment safe. But my first buying experience with Amazon was great, and so far this \"Acceptable\" condition tablet has been preforming fine."}

It had a clear screen no dents no scuffs or scratches anywhere on the device! My iPad is also updated to the latest software which is iOS 7.1.2 and my iPad came with all new accessories!

I have a first generation Ipad I am replacing with this and it is older and has no signs of wear. No chewed up casing or blemishes in the screen so I expected the \"normal signs of wear\" to be similar to mine. This seems cosmetic and the screen issue isn't major, just some lighter areas."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Ignorance is bliss. I work at BestBuy and people always ask me \"APPLE or ANDROID.\" Of course it depends on the user and most people who come in the store weren't technologically savvy. So, the majority of people wanted something easy to pick up and learn. Therefore, the majority of my recomendations were the iPad. I am in college and I have an internship. Both of these roles I use the iPad in. I am even using my iPad right now. I have a Macintosh computer and I found myself using my iPad for the majority of my computing needs. The iPad has also paid itself off by the cost of Text Books alone. Every book I get on my iPad saves me on average about $100. E text books are much cheaper than buying books on campus. I also have a keyboard case which they sell on Amazon for less $50.00. I use an app called Pages, which is an Apple developed app, that allows me to edit, import and export Word Documents. Not to mention its movie and music capabilities. I also invest heavily and the iPad has made my life so much easier when it comes to managing my investments and banking. Overall, the iPad has been a life saver for me and my family. Also, another great product that is a must have is a Zagg Invisible shield. They are a little difficult to put on but they have instructional videos on how to do it. Thanks for reading."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I've had my iPad 2 (this is my second one by the way) for a while (maybe 2 years?). Anyways, I was surprisingly a little disappointed. This isn't Apple's greatest product, that's for sure. Its slow, constantly crashes, and it pretty much useless. Also, you may think 16 GB is enough space, but even if you have an abundance of cloud storage or don't plan on storing much on the device, I can assure you that you'd be wise to get an iPad with more than just 16 GB. Its truly not as much as you'd think. I keep very, very little on the device, as I store nearly everything in the cloud, and I don't ever take/store photos on this iPad, but even so, I'm constantly having to delete things in order to install the latest update. This is incredibly inconvenient and so annoying!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Bought this item because of the great price. I didn't mind that it was 3 years old, I just wanted a nice tablet that I can browse the internet on because my 2008 is getting slow and can't run multiple programs at once, which makes it difficult to use iPhoto and/or photoshop while online. So after I bought it I was really looking into the reviews and thought it was odd how long and detailed the reviews were. I clicked on the one star reviews and got a bad feeling. Most of them were how they bought it labeled \"new\" but it was damaged or something was wrong with the system, or that they got it extremely late. I started to think the 5 star reviews were spam and it was a big scam and noticed some of the accounts said the same thing on multiple items. My delivery date came and went and was really worried I wasted my money. The next morning it came, and i was happy it wasn't at least extremely late. I got it \"packaged sealed\" and opened it up. Noticed it didn't have the plastic on the iPad itself like it should but there was no defect physically. It also started up with iOS 7 which is not right considering its a 3 year old iPad. But thankfully it's working great and looks brand new. I don't know if it's with every iPad purchased here or I was just lucky, but I've been using it for 3 days straight and it's been working amazing. Hope this helps."}

Unfortunately I needed an IPad for work since the software my company was using for a project only ran on IPads.  I wanted to spend as little as possible but still get a quality device.  I purchased a refurbished device on Amazon from Instant Replay Electronics (Instantreplayelectronics.com).  It worked fine at first however that quickly changed.  I was having trouble with connecting and staying connected to wifi.  I was in a jam because I had a 30 day warranty from the seller and my meeting where the IPad was required was coming up in a week.  I corresponded with Shane from the seller and was told that they would ship the replacement the next day after they received it.  To their credit, they did just what they promised and I had the IPad for my meeting.  Although I wish the product would not have needed to be returned (I never had good luck with refurbished items), I was pleased that the seller did as promised.  If you are looking for a cheap IPad but are concerned about getting a lemon, this seller stands by his word."}

When I got the iPad it took a bit longer to charge but once it charged everything was fine. But when I tried to set it up it wouldn't detect any wifi even though I had a connection on all my other devices like my iPod and laptop.\nEven at school, where wifi was throughout the whole campus, I was having a hard time detecting wifi. I finally got it but I had to hold my iPad very still and it had a one bar connection even though my classmates, who had surfaces, latptops and iPads, had three bars.\nFinally I was able to get wifi connection at my home, however I has to be within 3 yds of the router on the other side of the house which was a little inconvienent for my but I was still able to get my work done so i wasn't complaining too much.\n\nI had tried factory resets, turning it off-waiting- then turning it back on, letting it die on its own, and I even took it into the Apple store; where they did their own reset. And nothing worked. I believe, and the apple workers also thought, that the attenta may have been burnt out, however there's nothing they can do.\n\nI enjoy my iPad, besides having to be very close to the router to get any real work done that requires internet access, everything works great!

Like both cameras really aren't that good really Apple a $400 tablet with only 0.7 mp front and back camera. Not to mention there's no micro sad card slot wich i know none of apples devices have but still they should add it in to them a lot of people wind up needing more space. And why was Siri not added in it was out before this tablet was and it was put in the iPhone 4. People who actually read this review before you buy it ur better off getting a galaxy tab 3 lite it's a lot cheaper then this. its graphics are equal if not better and it has a 2mp camera a whole lot better than this one it alson has a micro sd card slot up to 32 gigs of memory."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have been looking for a new tablet for a few weeks now. Its hard to know what to look at or choose because there are so many different ones. I finally decided that I was just going to forget about it. Why do I need a new tablet when I still have my ipad 2?\n\nYou see all these tablets that claim this and that and have thousands of things they can do. Im actually sick of reading about all of them! My ipad already does all of those things. I used mine all through community college now Im in university and I still use it hours every day. I have friends that have other kinds of tablets. One of them has the newest ipad that I like but I was also thinking about a newer kindle which another of my friends has. The kindle is nice and so is the new ipad but when looking at the screens and then looking at my ipad I LIKED my ipad2 screen better than theirs. The colors are better. IDK why. Even my friend said that the color on mine was better than her new ipad even though that one has the newer screen.\n\nIve had mine for 3 years. Although its older, its still great as the new ones just not as great of a screen. The one thing I dislike is the cameras are not as great as some other tablets but I still take a lot of beautiful pictures though. But everything else is great. So, I finally realized that if I was going to buy a new tablet right now I might even buy an ipad 2 again because of how cheap they are now."}

I didn't order it for my self and I told the person who I purchased it for he said it's ok. I called customer service all I got was smart remarks. I was told \"we have other sellers so we don't know about the products that are being sold\". So I asked how you sell something on your site that you don't know about?

It is a step up from my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 when using it on the internet, but the Kindle has been truly reliable and easy to use.\nThe unit arrived with a 3% battery charge so I plugged in the charger and came back to it the next morning to find it at only 74% charge. So I left it for another 24 hours while I searched the net for iPad2 battery issues. It seems everyone feels that these units are slow to recharge. When it finally reached a 100% charge I started learning how to use it. This is not a toy, it really is a computer and has many features that are not readily apparent so I bought an \"iPad For Dummies\" book on Amazon to help me get the most out of my unit. I recommend this to anyone new to an iPad. Recharges now take less time than before. I paid $214.99, including shipping, for this unit and feel like I saved 50% over a new unit. I surf the web, do emails, read my Kindle books on it and am now searching the available Apple apps.\nI feel really great about this purchase and the unit. I worked for a large computer company for 38 years and always had a company laptop or whatever, so going to an Apple product was a big deal for me. Take the plunge!"}

Battery life is superb compared to my laptop and the picture is as well.\nBut what really makes this so useful are all the applications you have for it and how easily you can call them up. Want to send an email or check the ones you have waiting. Easy. Want to play a video game Easy. Do you subscribe to a magazine and have a few minutes and you want to read it. Easy. Listen to music. The same. Take a beautiful and I mean beautiful picture and send it to someone quickly. Easy. Children around and you want to make a little video of them. Easy. I could go on and on and on. But the bottom line is EASY. And for what $300 or so. You can't miss."}

I got this when it first came out. I'm IT savvy(ish), and knew how to set the thing up. At the same time, I gave my Windows Netbook to my lovely mother :-)  It was her first time with a computer and it didn't go well. Now don't get me wrong, I love Windows and use it every day, but it's hard explaining to a 75 year old why you need security updates and a reboot, or why something is stuck in the Outbox, or many other occurrences.\nUltimately, I decided to upgrade to a newer iPad (go iPad Air!), and I took the Netbook from her, and gave her this instead. Sure, I set up a few things like email, etc. and had to tell her that \"Safari is now your Internet Explorer\", but then she was off!\nThe point is that these things are just so intuitive, that almost anyone can just work them out. For anyone thinking of getting someone older (or maybe even younger), into using the Net, etc., I can't recommend this enough."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I am primarily an Android and PC user, so I was a bit hesitant picking up a tablet made by Apple. The reason I am giving this product 4 stars over 5 is because of the lack of usb/SD support. There is absolutely no excuse not to have these ports available. For those of you who don't care, take this review as 5 stars. I found myself needing those ports, but the applications are fantastic. Being a college student, I use Pages, voice recorder, and goodnotes the most, which, by themselves, are amazing applications that help me get through classes with little stress. This thing helps me manage my life, so consider me polytheistic in terms of technology. I love my PC, Galaxy III, and iPad 2 all very much for what they offer."}

Of course it does not have an Ethernet connection so I can't even wire the paperweight to the internet.\nNo apparent solution from Apple in the works as they appear to not recognize the problem is an iPad problem.\nI believe Apple IOS updates have degraded the capability.

There are also many free apps that are your usual apps. The app store has thousands of apps specifically for ipads. This allows you to have an enjoyable time when using your ipad. When purchasing your ipad, your item comes with free built in apps. These apps include the camera, calendar, clock, safari and many more general apps you need on a everyday basis. Surfing the web on your Ipad can not get any easier. It was created so that everyone can easily learn from your 4 year old sister to your 70 year old grandmother. The buttons on the exterior of the ipad include the home, volume, and silence key and the hold button. The power and battery life of the ipad is excellent. You can go hours of surfing the web or playing games without having to keep charging it everyday.  For example, I recently went on a trip to San Francisco which took 6 hours. I watched movies on the way there and movies on the way back and didn't have to chrage it during my vacation. It was amazing to be able to use it for so long and not have to keep charging it on my trip. On my trip I was also able to factime my brother who was back at home. With the ipad you can videochat and factime anyone at anytime as long as you have wifi. This allows you to have contact with someone you haven't seen for a while. It allows you to be able to see someone while talking to them at the same time. This for me is the best part of the ipad since It clearly allows me to see my brother who lives far away from me. The Apple Ipad 2 is an excellent product overall. If you are still debating whether or not to purchase an Ipad 2 you should go and play with one hands on first before purchasing. You can go to best buy or an Apple store to witness this marvelous item in action. I give the Ipad 2 five stars because I love it. It is very reliable for anything and the design of it makes it easy to use anywhere you go!"}

I now have an appointment at the Apple store today for them to see what the problem might be.  The really weird thing is the ipad had a user name on the setup screen that was displayed on my macbook. as if soneone else owned this ipad before.  I thought I was buying a brand new iPad, and I paid full price.  So it should not have been used before, right?  Is Amazon/ShopVius selling referbusided products on the cheap or just unknowlingly doing so through a second party??  Not a good business practice Amazon!  Buy from Apple directly if you desire their products.  Safer by far.\nNot a happy camper!!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I thought I'd try the iPad despite disliking most apple products. This item proved to be just as awful as other apple products I've had. Too expensive for what you get and is so restricted to Apple's dictator style software. If you love apple you'll probably love this but if not you'll dislike it just as much as I do."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I'll mix it up a little and start with the things I don't like about the iPad 2. I sold my iPad 2 a while back, but I now have an iPad 3 and iPad Air. 4 iPhones, and an iMac.  On the other side of the fence I own a Kindle Fire HDX 7\", and did own a 7\" Lenovo tablet, both of which I like also.  Obviously the only draw-back I can think of with the iPad 2 is the poor resolution, which probably isn't even that big of a deal to some people. To me it's a deal breaker, and that is why I sold my iPad 2, however when I got the iPad 3 and realized how much heavier it was, I actually kind of regretted getting rid of my older version!  I absolutely love the light weight of the 2, ALMOST as much as I love the Retina display of the successive models.  I honestly can't tell any real difference in the speed of the 2, vs. the 3, vs even the Air! I guess I'm not all that much into games anymore, which is probably the only place the upgraded power and speed of the newer iPads would ever come in to play anyway!\n\n  As I mentioned before, the Retina display to me is a very worthwhile tradeoff even for a heavier iPad.  I actually prefer my iPad w/ Retina and keyboard case to a much more expensive Mac book Air, without Retina display. The reason being, no matter how close you set the iPad to your eyes (such as laying in bed with it sitting on your chest, the clarity is just like reading printed material right out of a book, and to me that's more important than a big screen any day of the week! I much prefer the new fire wire charging cables over the 32 pin one that the iPad 2, android tablets, and other phones use.  I hate having to worry about which side is supposed to be up or down...\n\n  The reason I would go with an iPad 2 over any of the other Android tablets, including the Kindle Fire, even though probably all the android tablets have far superior hardware for the same amount of money, is that iEnvironment. iOS, iTunes, iCloud, better quality apps, even from the exact same software on iOS vs. Android.  Owning something from Apple is not about a status symbol or anything like that for me, to me it's like owning a piece of art that makes my heart go pitter-pat every time I pick one up or sit down to relax with one on my chest.  My satisfaction and joy of owning and using such device with such a OS and compatibility with everything in my book is well worth the extra money that Apple charges for their devices.  I'm also very proud to support an American company, versus a Chinese or Korean one... sorry, but do you haters even stop to think that all the Chinese and Korean equipment use poorly paid and poorly cared for cheap labor in China just like Apple does... duh!"}

No where in the description does it say non-U.S. or European plug.\nAnother thing that was not as advertised is that it keeps asking for a SIM card as if we bought one that could be put on a cellular network when the description clearly says Wifi and does not list a carrier."}

They even gave me a brand new magnetic cover for it.  I'm very happy with the seller and will buy from them again."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "My lovely and kind daughters bought me the ipad2 as a birthday present October 2012. In brief you can love 50% of what the product has to offer and you can hate the other 50%.\n\nStrengths: excellent video quality and simplicity ? Docs to Go works fairly well, but not without glitches particularly if your desktop crashes and has to be reloaded. No way to sync the existing \"good files\" That,is supposed to be \"apple easy\" ?\n\nBook reader capability works pretty well. I can listen to mp3 audios or lectures and sermons. But it misses a continue listening where I left off feature. Battery life is decent.\n\nConns: Absolute torture for the over 50 years old crowd. NO usb; TO MAKE ANYTHING WORK OR BE USABLE YOU HAVE TO purchase Apple apps on apple's terms.\n\nTo get initial questions answered I drove 100 miles to the nearest Apple store in Augusta, Georgia on three separate occasions and once there, essentially had to listen to the \"prepared class\" rather than learn how to make the ipad2 immediately productive.\n\nIf you want to the ipad2 to do anything productive, you have to install \"apps\". Pay us and pay us and pay us. Many of the \"free\" ipad apps are very buggy. You are left to read user's reviews and \"try\" out the app which can make you waste 2 hrs of your time because it is not a properly written app and \"hangs\" or crashes. Then you have to \"jump through hoops to get it off Itunes or it will remain on your ipad2. If you have to uninstall it, you waste more time.\n\nAs I said 50% of it is \"slick\" and 50% of it needed three years to get the biggest \"bugs\" out of it.\n\nSafari browser is a difficult and cumbersom adjustment for Windows users. The E-Mail program requires you to relearn EVERYTHING Apple's way. Sound will not automatically play in many or most videos because they are tied to quick time. So now you are forced to buy other apps which may or may not play the video you just stumbled across.\n\nAPPLE ITUNES IS AN ABSOLUTE JOKE. IT IS WRITTEN FOR YOU TO BUY STUFF FROM THEM PERIOD ! The first page that pops up is begging you to buy their songs or videos.\n\nSimply tranferring existing mp3's to the ipad 2 requires you to jump through hoops and waste an unbelievable amount of time.\n\nDocuments to Go works fairly well unless your desktop crashes and you have to reload your desktop. Then, you have no way of simply \"syncing\" the existing files on the ipad2 to a new desktop. An absolute pain in the xxs and waste of time!\n\nThere is NO seemless way to transfer existing password programs to take over in Safari. You have to buy the apple offerred program and I DID NOT find it easy to use.\n\nVideo HAH ! Video plays beautifully BUT ONLY ON THE IPAD. Try and transfer the video elsewhere and you face aggravation. I downloaded the latest quick time to my computer and the download video file (through the cable) WOULD NOT PLAY.\n\nAs I said aggravation. Would I buy one again or recommend the ipad2 ? No. There are cheaper alternatives out there that cost less money. For the money spent here I could purchase a 14 or 15 inch windows laptop computer.\n\nBorn in 1947"}

If you search google by \"WIFI issue on IOS 7\", you can find that a lot of users have the same issue as what I have.

Why do I have to pay couple hundred dollars for the problem caused by using Apple new IOS? Apple made a bad IOS release and you can approve this by searching on Google. However, now Apple is tring to provide a workaround for the issue caused by Apple at the user's cost. This is a very bad business practice.\n\nAre you still going to buy Apple product if your new device fail to work in your next upgrade and you have to spend several hundred dollars to get a replacement even it is not your fault?\n\nI would suggest those who is consider buying apple product to wait until you make sure that your next update will not cause such a big problem."}

It had a very crisp and unique look, functioned smoothly, and took care of all my entertainment needs. Then I turn it on one day and see I have an update. iOS 7...\n\nSince the update I feel robbed and cheated. Even the simplest of functions(like typing in a 4 digit password) have a lag/delay. The \"new and improved\" graphic design is a total disaster. It looks like a 5 year old was asked to replicate the look of a windows tablet.\n\nWould you like to watch a movie or tv show on your iPad with iOS 7? If you said yes then you'd better grab a pair of oven mitts to hold it with. That's right-now the back gets scalding hot after 30 minutes using it.\n\nFinally we get to the battery life. I spent around 10 minutes writing this review and in that time the battery has gone from 91% down to 83%. Before the update a single charge would last almost an entire week of medium/light use.\n\nMy mother has the same issues with her iPad so it's not that mine is faulty or defective. I want to stress that my problems have been more with the update to iOS 7 than with the iPad itself. If these issues are resolved then I will edit my review and my rating, but as of right now I can't recommend this product to anybody."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "This model came out in March 2011, and me and 3 other family members have had one since June 2011.\nDespite the age of the model it has not become obsolescent like many other gadgets. It runs the latest IOS 7 and apps perfectly. The battery still holds a full charge, and all of the buttons and features still work (I could not say the same about my 4 year old Ipod Touch...).\nI use it primarily for web browsing, email, Facetime and e-books.\nThis model does NOT have a retina display. Although Retina is nice it makes no difference in day to day use, including viewing photos. So what if I can see dots close up? I am certainly not bothered by them.\nSure its fun having the most up to date toy, but having the new Ipad Air would not enhance the enjoyment that I get from the device one bit.\nStill, it seems like chutzpah for Apple to sell an old model for $400, so if I were in the market, I would look at used/refurbished models. The device is very well built and reliable so I wouldn't worry about getting a used one in good condition."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I ordered this particular model because I lost the one I received as a gift.  I don't want the person who gave it to me to find out about the loss.  Also, I cannot afford a new one from Apple.  I chose the vendor Sikksound because of the positive reviews.  I am conditionally pleased with my choice.  The iPad I received was in pristine condition, with an Apple box, charging cord and fast charge plug.  It also came with a textured protective backing.  I discovered that the iPad had been used in Italy because of the formatting and information I found in the settings.  After a series of very courteous and helpful e-mail conversations with Sikksound, I was able to resolve the formatting issues.\n\nHowever, I warn purchasers of used AT&T iPads of an expensive and cumbersome complication.  AT&T uses a SIM card to enable cellular data usage.  When sold by Apple, a new AT&T iPad comes with a SIM card which allows for periodic data usage.  In other words, a cellular data plan may be purchased through the iPad for a month, and then cancelled.  When cellular data is needed again, one can simply by more data for that month, and so on.  Because of it's Italian heritage the iPad I received was equipped with a SIM card incompatible with AT&T in the U.S.  In order for the iPad to use cellular data, a new AT&T SIM card was required.  A local AT&T store installed one without alerting me to the $36 fee, and without explaining that the monthly data plan must be ongoing, or the SIM card is deactivated.  A replacement SIM card from AT&T is not renewable, like the one which comes in a new iPad from Apple.  The AT&T store rep deactivated the SIM card within a few minutes after explaining that the data plan must be ongoing.  I only discovered the $36 charge when my bill arrived.  Luckily AT&T removed it because I had not used any data.\n\nI rarely use cellular data because wi-if is so accessible.  However, for those who want to use occasionally use the cellular capability, you might want to do some more research.  I recommend spending time on the phone with, or visiting an Apple store, to find out your cellular data options."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I got this iPad in October 2011, according to the engraving on the back, and since 2 years seems to be the extent of most gadgets' life these days, I simply had to make a review. A good one, of course.\n\nPROS:\n\nWeight: By far, the most amazing thing about this tablet is that it weighs so little. I believe it weighs less than any other iPad out there, which is weird, but I think the iPad mini is supposed to cater to those who have a problem with that. The iPad isn't meant to be held in one hand, though. It's a real personal computer, only in tablet from, and you must treat it as such. If you need to be able to read in bed or something, get a kindle or iPad mini. However, you'll find that the iPad is very convenient for most uses.\n\nDesign: The front of the iPad is defined by a single pane of multitouch glass - and a home button. The back is made of aluminum. There is a front camera, a rear camera in the top right corner, and a speaker at the bottom. This simplistic design, which Apple litigiously fought for against Samsung, is in a word, magical. I'm not too much into the marketing stuff, but seriously, there is something extremely premium about Apple products, and I am sure it is more than the pseudo philosophical marketing. The Smart Cover actually works really well, though its necessity is... debatable. Overall, this tablet feels like its worth 500 dollars. Ok, so it's 400 now, but you know what I mean.\n\nDurability: The primary user of this tablet is an unhygienic now-9-year-old who is not exactly dexterous and immediately gets on it after school, sin lavar sus manos. If you know glass, you know that the only thing that can really scratch it are minerals. That's right. Not knives or cleats, though they may if you try hard enough. It's finger salts, salt from food, dust, dirt, sand, jewelry like diamonds and quartz. However, today I wiped off all the prints with a damp hand towel and I could count, I kid you not, 3 micro scratches. That's amazing. This tablet has been dropped, probably not from extreme heights, but still. The glass at the corners, along with the aluminum housing, is tattered. There are several deep scratches in the aluminum on the back. However, there are no functional damages to this tablet. That's also very nice. You probably don't need the Smart Cover for its protective aspect. You will however, want it so you can use it for support. It helps a lot.\n\nDisplay: Eek. I'll kick it to you straight; the resolution of this screen is terrible. If your going to be looking at pictures, you're going to be disappointed. 1024x768 doesn't cut it. My 4.5 inch S2 had a resolution of 800x640. I thought it was sub par, but acceptable. The iPad is just bleh. It's colors are amazing though. I don't know too much about outdoor performance, but I've never felt that brightness was an issue, so it's probably ok. What the iPad lacks in detail more than makes up in size. Laying down in bed with a ten inch screen feels so empowering. I feel like I have all the media in the world in my hands, and I almost do.\n\nApps: I don't use my iPad for work. It stays at home most of the time, and at home, I have my desktop. I would assume it would be pretty easy to use iWork to create, but I wouldn't know. *flame alert* I believe Android is better for smartphones, and iOS for tablets. There is a serious lack of tablet apps for android, but I am continually surprised at the growing iOS tablet app ecosystem. However, there are a greater variety of apps on Android, in my experience. The iPad can actually handle games pretty well, despite its age. That all I really need to say. There isn't any calculator or weather or stocks app, but you'll find great alternatives in the App Store.\n\nCamera: Why are you reading this? What are you doing with your life? Why would you want to use the iPad's camera for anything except FaceTime? Seriously? Well, that's all you're going to be able to do, because the cameras on the 2 are terrible. Really. I would expect more for 500 bucks, but whatever. It's not a priority. If you ever find yourself in so dire a situation that you need to use the iPad camera, you better invest in a disposable, or something.\n\nBattery life: Ho ho. Tee hee. The battery life of the 2 makes me want to giggle. Even 2 years later, the battery life still feels virtually infinite. I can almost guarantee you, you will never have a problem with the iPads battery life. This is because if the square cube principle. The surface area (screen size) increases at rate of the dimensions, squared. The volume, cubed. More volume means more battery. So, theoretically, the bigger the device, the longer the battery life. Oh, and iOS is super efficient, almost forgot that.\n\nPerformance: Welp, iOS7 is here. Anybody with anything older than 2012 must upgrade to escape the lag! Not so. Though the animations in iOS7 are super slow and can induce \"motion sickness\", the iPad 2 handles it pretty well. (I swear, auto correct has something against the word we'll.) The gaming isn't bad for such an old device, though I have yet to try out newer games like asphalt 8. However, you'll be able to stream video (not in hd, of course!) and play 2d games  with no hitches. The keyboard does sometimes take a while to pop up and apps do take somewhat longer to load, but hey, we're talking about an old geezer tablet here.\n\nFeatures: I haven't been able to use Bluetooth to transfer files yet, presumably because Apple wants me to upgrade and use AirDrop. Classic Apple. And I'm pretty sure Siri could easily run on the 2. Oh well, looks like we're stuck with... The two doesn't have any gimmicks, per se, to it. It has the dual cameras, but that's about it. There is nothing to show off. Just to experience. FaceTime is great, though. Like, wow. It's really the best video chat technology I've ever seen. If nothing else, I would commend apple on its FaceTime infrastructure. It's simple and fun and convenient, not to mention powerful.\n\nOverall: Even after 2 years of not so nice treatment, my 2 is functionally perfect. It really feels amazing to be able to consume content on such a big screen. The thinness and lightness of the device make it disappear as you're using it. FaceTime really is the best interpersonal video chat platform as of today. IOS 7 runs fine on this, but don't expect to be so lucky next year. I was actually shocked to see the price here on Amazon. Really? 400 bucks for a 2011 tablet? When the 5 is just around the corner and will cost only 100 more? Only a fool would buy it now. However, the 2 really bolstered the image of Apple I had. I have a first gen Nano that actually still works for a whole day! I would expect the iPad to do the same. This review isn't recommending that you buy the 2. All I'm saying is that Apple makes the best tablets out there. Even the most hardcore Android fanatic (which I am dangerously close to) could agree on some levels. iPads are feat for consuming content. Maybe even for creating. However, if you want to get real work done, you're going to want to wait for the next generation of windows 8 pro tablets with Broadwell Chips in them. I need an IDE to be able to do programming when I go to college, and the fact that no such software is available for iOS means that I can't take this there. The iPad isn't a complete replacement for a real computer. But it comes pretty darn close.\n\nSent from my iPad"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I purchased this for my 3 year old son as an upgrade to his ipad 1. He has been very proficient at using ipad from a very early age. itunes store has a huge selection of learning apps for his age group and younger. My son has been a ipad and ipod user sinc he was about 9 months old, he thinks he is playing, but he is really learning. He is way ahead of where he should be and he has had a ton of fun doing it. After ios 6&7 came out his ipad 1  was no longer able to keep up with the technology of the upgraded apps. I purchased the 64g ipad 2 so he would have plenty of room for his apps since some of the apps can be large downloads. i am able to also to limit what he is able to do in settings and the app store. He can only get apps ifi unlock it. ipad 2 was easy to child lock certain features and content. ipad 2's long battery is great on trips, it keeps him busy and i don't need active wifi for his apps to work. I wish that ipad existed with my other children. I like that he is learning on current to future technology that most daycares or preschools can not provide.  I recommend this to any parent. The ecpense is worth it. A childs education id priceless. ipad 2 is perfect for facilitating that.\nTJ"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "My wife bought a supposedly new iPad 2 via Amazon which was supplied by the iPad Shop.  When I tried to register it Apple said it was out of warranty.  Long story short, this iPad ended up being a replacement for another unit sold by he iPad Shop back in 2011.  They received a replacement from Apple and sold it to my wife as new in September 2013.  While it might have been new it was recorded by Apple as a replacement to the original owner and thus received the warranty only at the time of return -- which by 2013 had long since expired.  Further, the serial number on the box did not match the serial number on the iPad.  After a back and forth with Apple customer service I finally ascertained that this was a replacement iPad intended for someone else and sold as new by the iPad Shop.  Apple's serial number tracking confirmed this.  It might have been a new unit but Apple changes the serial number on units they replace and would not warranty it beyond the \"original purchase date\".  Bottom line:  Go directly to Apple for their equipment.  That said, I'm not real pleased with Apple for failing to warranty an obviously new unit just because they assigned a new serial number to a customer who never received it.  I returned the iPad and bought another directly from Apple -- I'm not sure why.  Basically, I'm not pleased with either Apple or the iPad Shop.  But I am pleased with Amazon who noted that there have been similar complaints from this vendor and quickly refunded the purchase price.  Just beware of the iPad Shop."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have resisted getting a tablet for years. As others have observed, a computer without a real keyboard is weighted toward content consumption rather than content creation (otherwise known as work). To fill the need for a lightweight, long battery life, zero fan/vent portable, I had purchased a Chromeook. Frankly, after the novelty wore off, it was sitting in the drawer more than on my lap.\n\nWell a month or so ago, on a whim I got the iPad 2. Within 24 hours of playing with it and discovering both powerful productivity (like aTimelogger and DayOne) and music apps (such as Synthesia, Garage Band) that fill voids in what I've seen as an owner of an Android phone, I became a devoted member of the iPad cult. From there, I tested several keyboards and have settled on the Kensington Ultimate and Logic Fabricskin.\n\nNow, after month downrange, it smile on my face hasn't worn off -- the iPad and I are inseparable. It is really an integral part of my life and work.\n\nI will probably sell the Chromebook on eBay. This will be the first of many iPads to come as they come out with newer versions."}

I did so correctly, but it was quickly denied with a recommendation that I set up the iPad up using iTunes, another piece of Apple related software. If you don't have access to a computer-- tough luck! I downloaded ITunes onto my computer, connected the iPad, and low and behold, this time it accepted my Wi-Fi password. Could it be that I was manipulated to get iTunes loaded onto my computer? And while I was about it I had to uncheck opportunities to download other Apple software that I don't want.  Anyway, the iPad screen device lit up, finally! If the iPad had eyes it would have seen my scowling face, but I pressed on and eventually set up my e-mail account. The clock on the iPad face was wrong so I tried to change it. That should be easy right? Wrong! Internal clocks gave correct time for all over the world, but the clock on the icon was wrong. Hmm, I thought I'd better look at the manual, which of course is not included with the product. However, the tiny info card that comes with the iPad says it's available on the Apple web site. Ah, ha! I found it. But it wants to know what software is in my iPad. If there's an easy way to determine that, it escapes me. I suppose it's in the manual but if you don't know what manual to look for, you have the perfect catch 22. Anyway I made a guess and looked at the manual. There are 137 pages. At this point I decided the iPad is not user friendly and I'll return it . . . as soon as I've found out how to remove my e-mail password now stored somewhere within the iPad type 2 with software type ????"}

The speaker is on the rear of the ipad (why?!) making the poor audio quality and volume even worse. I have sensitive eyes and the brightness does not go nearly low enough to use comfortably in a dark room at night. The volume buttons don't adjust to when the ipad is rotated so I am constantly changing it in the wrong direction. The web access is dodgy even though my router is in my room and there's no signal issue. iOS is very lacking, notifications are tedious to turn off, ad block doesn't do bleep...\n\nBattery life is pretty much the only thing decent about this.

To that end, I was right but as far as iPad generations are concerned, this device hits the sweet spot for what I use the tablet for (surfing the web, typing posts on Amazon, Tweeting and the occasional e-mail).  It's not too powerful for gaming per se but offers a silky smooth performance for business related functionality.  I even find that I don't need a BlueTooth keyboard as typing on it's screen in landscape mode is fast and easy enough.\n\nThe only disappointment I have is that I paid for the cellular antenna.  I find that I mostly use this device in the home as a quick means of accessing the Internet where a WiFi access point is readily available.  I also take it with me out-of-town and for the most part, most hotels offer free WiFi so the cellular aspect of this device was money wasted.\n\nI am EXTREMELY pleased with this device's battery life.  It has been tested and found that the iPad 2 has the longest battery life of ALL the iPad generations up through the iPad 4 or \"iPad with Retina Display!\"  I truly believe this iPad second generation is the \"sweet spot\" in Apple's iPad lineup and that is why the Cupertino company is continuing to offer this device for purchase.  You don't really need the \"retina\" screen or the extra 500mb of memory for business tasks such as surfing the web or writing an e-mail.  This device will work flawlessly for those tasks.\n\nI can only express how happy I am that I purchased this tablet.  I will probably upgrade to the next iPad 5th generation, if it offers the robust WiFi AC and comes in an even slimmer, more elegant form factor.  I would recommend that users opt out of getting the cellular model unless they need to use the device in their cars for example.  I have a Garmin GPS, so this is a non issue."}

After more than two years of heavy use both personally and professionally I can say the Apple iPad changed my life. It is without a doubt one of the most innovative, useful, and powerful products on the market. That was true in April of 2010 when Apple released the first iPad, and it remains true to this day. An unimaginable number of iPad reviews exist online, so I will not restate the specs or the seemingly endless uses and applications. I will simply state that I have never regretted my purchase of my iPad for one second and I have found it to be one of the most versatile, useful, and simple pieces of technology I have ever owned. It's multipurpose functionality cannot be overstated. I cannot speak highly enough of the Apple iPad - and look forward to the day when I can upgrade to the latest model. Even so, my iPad 2 continues to be fully functional, fast, and sturdy. Why wait - BUY APPLE!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I received my iPad 2 and loved it for a few months. Take note that I am severe o.c.d. here, therefore, there is absolutely no way it got wet or dropped or any other sort of freak accident occurred on my part to hurt it, as suggested by every single troubleshooter out there. It started ghostwriting and not responding correctly to where it was being touched... So I checked out my warranty situation and of course, being that it was a present that was bought months previous to my taking ownership of it (via a belated birthday gift) but never taken out of the box, not that that matters to Apple, I was told I would have to pay full price to replace the touch sensor which I found out recently is such a serious problem with Apple that they (if they cared about their consumers, that is) should have recalled it long ago.. I am already tired of talking about this. I am just getting angry about it again...\n\nI had the same sort of problem when I received an iPod shuffle for an Xmas gift years before.... The people I know with Apple computers can rarely read discs I send them and the friends I have with iPhones have all switched back to droid types...\n\nI do not know why this brand is so popular but I will never buy from them. And I would like to take this opportunity to thank Apple for ruining a few gifts for me. Some really good hearted people spent a lot of their hard earned money to buy me thoughtful gifts which, thanks to your lack of consumer courtesy and a tendency to charge way too much for inferior products, turned out to be complete flops.\n\nAs an extra added insult (to me, not you)... I am writing this on my friend's iPad 2 (the same as mine, that he bought about the same time as mine) He beats this thing mercilessly, gets it wet, steps on it, drops it, lets his toddler do horrible toddler things to it EVERY SINGLE DAY and guess what? This sticky disgusting thing never misses a beat for him.\n\nGo ahead and laugh."}

It came in 2 days, was well wrapped, it was called Very Good condition- a few scratches on the back, but basically perfect.  It came with an older cover ($40.00 is what it said, but definatley not worth that today, but hey it's a cover), 2 charge cords, clean and working perfectly.  I just ran up to TJ Max to get a new cover- and it really looks like a brand new IPAd for about half the price!  I know I got a very good deal and was happy to have the seller write back immediately for all my concerns, making sure that I was pleased with the product. Don't know what happened to others, but I am very pleased with this product and the responses of the seller.  This was a great deal and I am enjoying every second of my \"new\" ipad for a great price.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "SELLER NOT EVEN WORTH ONE STAR\nHonestly, I own the ipad 2 and I love it (AFTER I REPLACED MY FIRST ONE). But if you're considering ordering an ipad from armelectronics2011, THINK AGAIN. When I bought my first ipad 2, the listing was for a brand new still in box product. When I received it, the ipad was NOT in its original box (as I anticipated) and after a couple of months, I started to realize that the ipad 2 that I had purchased from armelectronics2011 was complete CRAP. I'm pretty sure that the screen on the ipad I had bought was actually replaced in a very unprofessional way and in time, it showed because the white ipad began to turn yellow. The home button did not work correctly, the glass began to peel away from the actual ipad, and the entire ipad began to act as if it had a virus (which apple products supposedly do not get viruses). When I contacted the seller about their false advertising for their \"brand new product\" it took two days of phone tag to even contact them, and even when I FINALLY talked to them, they basically told me \"oh well, not our fault, you can pay the return shipping and a restocking fee to get your money back\" -which by the way is not at all worth the trouble after all of their unnecessary fees for something that was THEIR FAULT. I in the end kept the ipad 2 from this seller (REGRETFULLY) and eventually bought a new one.\nBasically, if you want to splurge for an ipad of any sort, go for it because in my opinion it is worth it. But if you're planning to purchase from this seller, PLEASE don't. Really. Do not get ripped off in the way I did. You are truly better off buying an ipad(any generation) for the full value."}

Could not be more pleased with purchasing our refurbished iPad 2 from RockerJakes.com.  We chose RockerJakes because of the detailed description of the unit and prompt reply when we inquired directly to the company before making the purchase.  The unit was described as having 3 scratches which upon arrival were very minimal and acceptable - especially after putting it in a case.  Seems brand new actually!  The unit came with a protective screen so we put that on right away before the children used the device.  Within minutes we were up and running the iPad 2 full force testing it out.  It works great and seems just as great as the iPads we have purchased brand new.\n\nWe did have some hiccups with shipping.  Didn't realize a signature was required to receive the package.  After wrestling with Amazon and UPS, we worked something out and Amazon was very customer focused and willing to help make things right.  Thank you!!"}

Mine is also a refurb but I I bought it at Apple online and spent about $700.00 for it compared to Rocket Jakes price of $399. A Genius at Apple told me he prefers refurbished products as any FACTORY quirks that existed are straightened out. The iPad was simple to set up. It was in original Apple packaging and works perfectly. The AT&T Wi-fi was also easy to set up. AT&T has lower data charges for iPads than Verizon but Verizon has a larger coverage area. Alas! Money is tight. I also got a Smart Magnetic Cover for Apple Ipad 2 cover at Amazon from CyprusTech for $7.74 compared to the $39 I spent for mine at Apple and it looks and acts exactly the same. I'm thrilled with this product so far but I set it up with my Apple ID and now I'm going to have to jump through some hoops to figure out how to get my husband his own Apple ID because iTunes is all set up on one computer with MY Apple ID ....h-h-m-m-m!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "(Caveat: I'm not a techie dude (though I do enjoy some techno music... go figure, right?) so proceed cautiously with my review...)\n\nI've been brought to the iPad dragging my heels, kicking and screaming, like a bratty toddler told to eat his peas (I hate peas).\n\nMy history: I've not been a fan of the proprietary and I love music.  Some years ago, before my kids bought an iPod... I owned a Creative Zen Vision M MP3 player... 60 gigs that thing carried... and I could download whatever I wanted into it... no proprietary poo and nobody needed to know my financial information or address, and I loved that lil device for that freedom.  Creative created a great product, and in fact they own a couple of patents that enable certain Apple products to work, but like Beta recording tape... a technology that was superior to VHS, yet it was popularity of the lessor product that eventually killed the chances of the better device ever really taking hold.  Similarly, from a freedom point of view.. seems like much of the MP3 market has gone the way of the dinosaur, losing out to the proprietary Apple name.  And so begins my review.\n\nTo recap: I hate proprietary.  And Apple IS that: proprietary.  Having said this, and yielding to my better senses, I have made allowance to bend towards the Apple by initially purchasing my iPhone.  I still hate the proprietary... love the device; Apple, begrudgingly liked by me for the things they build, made such a great device in the iPhone that I decided to take the leap by swallowing the whole schtick and bought this iPad.\n\nThis second generation, 16 gig, iPad purchase was a big one for our family... actually, for my wife (as a birthday present to her), and she's been tethered to it for two days... loves it.\n\nIt's a nice sized tablet... much easier to surf the internet with a larger screen than that of an iPhone, so that's a nice plus.  As for their proprietary... if you move to Apple with the purchase of your own iPad, you'll have to give them information... personal information, to include credit card, and normally that's enough to stop me in my tracks, so if you're like me and don't easily want to part with giving this info out... this isn't the tablet for you.  But before you consider not buying this tablet for that reason, remember that once you do give in, you're introduced to a world of great products and support.\n\nAs far as functionability... this iPad is basically a picture/video taking wi-fi accessing internet surfing tool (nice run-on).  Conceptually, the tablet is intuitive in it's function... if you already own an iPod/iPhone/iPad.... yet if you don't, navigation/use of this tablet is pretty easy to learn... easier still if you have someone that owns one helping you for the first 2 mins.\n\nWhat makes this device interesting is the ability to add applications (apps) that enable you to do a millions things with this device.  Some apps are free while some cost money... and they're found once you hit the \"App Store\" icon on your device.\n\nMy iPad was purchased with the wi-fi connectibility option only; I wasn't interested in purchasing (another...) 3g AT&T smart device usage fee, though it's an option (another model...).  As for internet connectibility, I just have to find a wi-fi site and wahla... connection, at no extra cost to me.  Sure, this doesn't make the tablet very usable while in motion, but that's not a big deal for my usage intent... so this really doesn't effect me as it would someone who's occupation relies on such mobility usage (did that make sense?  Hope so...).\n\nThis tablet comes with 16 gigs of memory (same as my phone...); I have hundreds of photos and some video on my phone, but no music.  If you have an ample music collection you would like to carry/keep on this iPad, I might suggest you purchase one with a higher storage capability.  This iPad will be used by my wife and she's going to stick pictures on it, perhaps SOME music, but not much between the two; for her, 16 gigs is just right.\n\nAs for other functions: it's got a camera (don't ask me for specs... look them up.  New generation iPads have newer iris'/greater photo capabilities), that can also take video.  I can do a video type conferencing with another Apple device (another iPhone/iPad, for example)... it's called \"facetime\"... that's a neat feature that my 4 year old loves when I'm at work for two days or more at a time.  Battery life seems good... charging is a snap; USB or wall... you can do both with hardware supplied.\n\nImportantly, and to their credit... Apple does a great job supporting their products (my experience with a problematic iPhone, handled by Apple Care... was top-notch).  They take care of warrantied items very well.  An additional note: Apple stores, if you 've got one close-by... are a great resource for handling warranty/problematic software issues... so the support for the product, in-store or not, is there.\n\nAs for iPads or tablets in general... there are others, but even this second generation iPad makes internet connection, and use, a breeze.  After owning now... two devices, I'm a believer in the products that Apple (thus far...) have made... and though I STILL don't dig the proprietary thing, it's a reasonable trade-off for being able to use a pretty great device.\n\nI hope this review assists you in making your choice, whichever that choice may be.  Thanks for listening."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have had an iPad2 for roughly a year.  In that time, I have had to take it in for repairs twice.  The first time was when it was upgrading the OS software and simply stopped halfway through the process.  I plugged it in since I did not want it to die from lack of battery power.  Three days later, it was still at the same place in the download.  That was the first trip to the repair shop.  A week or two later, it is back and working great.  Now, about a month ago, it was at about 60% power so I plugged it in for the night.  That was the last I saw any life in the thing.  Since I do not have the receipt (it was a gift) and too much time has passed (even though much of the time was not necessarily in my possession), repairs are going to cost a bucket load.  The while that I had the iPad2 was pretty fun, but Heaven knows when I will see it again, and I believe that the information recorded on it will be gone.  So, short story, my experience is a two-star experience with Apple."}

I originally thought that it was just an overgrown iPod touch, but the more I learned about it, the more I realized that it seemed to be a small computer. The iPad has Bluetooth capabilities and I bought a Bluetooth keyboard to go with the iPad. I am still wrapping my head around the iPad and all its features. I really enjoy the iCloud, allowing me to sync up my iPhone and iPad. One of the first apps I downloaded was Pages and it has been fantastic. One of my biggest concerns regarding the iPad is the accessibility to remove documents, pictures,etc off of the iPad. There is no USB port, so I cannot hook up a zip-drive and due to the age of my Mac, I cannot download the iCloud app. So my only options are to email it to myself or go on my computer, go to the iCloud website, sign-on and get the document that way. When I brought this up to the Apple worker, he stated that the iPad is capable of printing directly from the iPad as an option as well. So that minimized my concerns. Over all, I am very happy with the decision I made, all my questions regarding the iPad have been able to be answered with a simple google-search. One of the best spur-of-the-moment purchases I have ever made."}

I also wish that I was told about all the scratches on the back, this is ok because I bought a case to cover it but I think when you spend a lot of money on something even if its used that the buyer should be notified of all the flaws before hand.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "My primary reason for acquiring an iPad was for leisure and for work in the future.  I am currently a college student with plans to teach at the high school level, so I knew there would be endless amount of apps that will enhance my teaching in the future.  Right now, schools are exploring 1 on 1 iPads with their students because it makes it so much easier to grade and create assignments without the hassle of textbooks.  At home, I became sick of pulling out my four-year old Dell laptop to surf the web, watch videos, and just play around.  I wanted something that was smaller, easy to travel with, and it had to be a tablet.  Now, my Dell is fine for writing papers and all the other obligations that come with being a college student, but for an apple product as efficient and productive as the iPad, the price is tough to beat.  The iPad does not replace a desktop or a laptop, but it is a tremendous technological device that is user friendly and fun to play with.  Whether it is for leisure or work, there is an application for it.  What I like the most is that the ios apple system signals to the iPad when it is time for an update, making it up to par with the latest technology, which in turn betters its efficiency and productivity instantly.  With that being said, the ability to access the apple store is what sets it apart from other tablets.  Like I previously stated, there are apps for everything, and there are even several free apps that increase enjoyment and productivity.  It is a must buy for anyone interested in a tablet for both leisure and work obligations.\n\nI also have an iPhone 4 which I use very religiously, and the iPad 2 is an extension of that for me.  There are fewer apps available for the iPad, but that's not saying a lot, as there are still thousands available for it, as I find myself searching for a new app daily on the apple store.\n\nI have the 32GB edition and have not come close to filling up all the storage space!  I think it is the perfect size for somebody that doesn't constantly use it, but for someone that is on it daily at work or at home.  If you are going to count on it for everything you do in regards to a computer device, I would recommend the 64GB, but for me the 32GB has been great and I have not run into any problems to this point.  In addition, the device is very light, and you can hold it with one hand.  Definitely buy a protective case for your iPad, even though I have found it to be very durable.\n\nIt is very nice to be able to use it like a mini computer.  You can access your personal files via google drive, drop box, etc. to increase productivity and bring your desktop or laptop files on the road with you.  One nice feature is that you can view websites with a mobile display or desktop display, serving for the benefit of all users.  Powerpoints, Word Documents, and PDF's are easy to view with the tap of the finger, which is very beneficial for someone in the business world or still in school.\n\nWhile I thoroughly enjoy my iPad 2, there are frustrations with it.  I find myself frustrated with the fact that I can't play Flash.  I like to watch videos, especially via twitter and facebook, and a lot of times I am unable to do so because of the software's inability to play flash.  In addition, I get frustrated because I wish I could make the iPad my only source of a computer.  I wish I could type on word and make a powerpoint as seamless as I do on my Dell.  I could do that, but on a college budget you don't want to be paying for an expensive app to make that a reality, but that's also the beauty of it.  You could download Microsoft Office products if you wanted to make it your go-to computer device.  One thing I would suggest is buying a keyboard for your iPad.  I went a year without one, but once I acquired a keyboard it made it that much more efficient to use!  So much easier to surf the web, iMessage, etc.\n\nIn essence, if you're having a tough time deciding on buying an iPad or not, I would highly suggest buying one.  Now, if it is between a MAC laptop and an iPad, go with the laptop.  But, if you are in the market for a tablet and are looking for efficiency and productivity with a tablet, the iPad is a much because of the apple IOS software and the thousands of applications available via the apple store.  The slick design with endless amount of possibilities to increase production with an iPad puts it a head above the rest.  Once you begin using an iPad, you won't regret the purchase."}

I mostly use it for nursing school, but also like to stream videos and play some games on it. The only downfall I've found to buying an iPad over other tablets, is that it doesn't work with Microsoft Office. You have to purchase an expensive app to be able to work with those types of documents."}

I don't live in an area where Wi-Fi is always available so I was limited to using it at home. so a few months later when my 50th birthday was coming up, my husband asked what I would like. I told him the only thing I wanted was the IPad with wireless AND 3G. Of course he thought I was nuts since I had a perfectly good, working IPAd already. So naturally, I got my wish!  We ordered a refurbished one to save money. I have not been disappointed yet! I take it everywhere with me. I am impressed with the speed even when using 3G. I am able to use it at our cabin and streamed our High School basketball State Championship game with zero problems.  The only problem I have now is I own a 5 month old Laptop that I rarely use!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I swore up and down I'd NEVER purchase an apple product, including things on itunes and the like.  So far, I have upheld that promise.  However, from a recent car purchase, I managed to obtain an iPad 2 16GB as a promotion.  Since my girlfriend had one and I did want some experience with iOS, I figured I'd begin poking around with it rather than simply selling it.\n\nThe good...\n\niOS is very easy to use and extremely straight forward.  Everything is laid out nicely and always a flick-tap away.  And most all programs work very well with the unit.  Software tends to be clean without too many bugs.\n\nWeb browsing (just using Safari) is very smooth.  Most sites work well.  There's the ocational hiccup but it's more from using a touchscreen or the dreaded lack of Flash.  But soon enough, sites will probably migrate away from flash and on towards HTML5 (or simply pages designed for mobile/iPads).\n\nUsability, such as typing is very straight forward.  The keyboard is well thought out and works much better than any I've used.  The touchscreen is very responsive too and multi-touch works without a problem.\n\nStandby time is awesome and the unit is still functioning (IE gives you push notifications of Skype/AIM/etc)\n\nGiven the standpoint of say someone's who's very unfamiliar with technology or who doesn't care to spend time \"configuring things\", this works great.  However, that is not who I am...\n\nThe bad...\n\nYou are extremely limited.  Being closed source, some apps simply are not available as they would be for Android or Windows-based tablets (and I mean x86, not Windows 8 RT)  Finding ways to print can be impossible, certain formats may be unreadable, and even simple things such as adding attachments in gmail may be hindered without installing additional apps.\n\nNo Flash support!!!  As mentioned above, things are moving away from flash.  However, many sites still use flash there for some sites will not display correctly.  You are also limited on sites like Youtube, sometimes being unable to open the same videos you can open on a desktop environment (or even Android devices).\n\nWhere are my files?!  Stuff just downloads.  You have no choice where to put them.  Download something you don't want to share then start browsing the photos you took using the camera, SURPRISE!\n\nLimited connectivity.  Expansion is limited to the propriatary apple plug on the bottom.  No OTG port, no standard USB, no microSD slot, no HDMI.  You can purchase some overpriced devices to give you these functions, but it would be nice to see some of them included.\n\n---\n\nAll in all, it depends on the person whether or not one of these would fit your bill.  My girlfriend loves hers and almost never uses her PCs anymore.  For me, I'll grab mine for basic web surfing and the like, but if I'm doing much typing or any surfing that requires a fair bit of clicking, I still will grab a laptop over this."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Chances are, you know what an iPad is and know the positives of it. It is very user friendly, it has tons of apps, and they are all ran through Apple so they work very well. There are occasional crashes with streaming app, but it only closes the app and you can reopen it. This is the iPad 2, so, if you are expecting Siri... you will be disappointed. Siri is nice, but it isn't needed to love this product. The maps is still awful, but you can get Google maps and that is much better. Realistically, this is wonderful for people who do a lot of internet based surfing and want a phone experience but bigger. It is also great for family that is horrible with tech. If you are wondering, \"Well, I'm a power user, is there anything for me?\" Firstly, you should know how to look that up yourself. Secondly, yes! You can VPN into a laptop or desktop with many apps available in the app store to Virtualize your desktop from any wifi access point. Great buy and if money is a problem, the iPad 2 is now cheap enough to not be a big purchase."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I wanted to know what I was missing and apparently it was my money.\n\nYou're dependent on iTunes and it's junk. Apple products are said to be easy to use but they don't live up to the hype. iTunes expects the user to know what to do. There are no clues as to how it should be used. All of that money and they can't even afford tool tips. I've spend an hour trying to figure out how to put a PDF into my iPad and it's like pulling teeth. A simple task made difficult by a bad design. Why can't I just drag and drop the files using Windows explorer like every other hardware product in the world? Why so difficult?\n\nApple had an edge when they were first to market. Now they're relying on the loyal base and offer no advantages. Pay more and do less. Still no USB or SD card slots? It makes every task difficult.\n\nGood for browsing the web and checking email but not much more.\n\nI had to try it and regret the purchase.\n\nSimple tasks could be A LOT easier.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter wasting another hour of my life I finally figured out how to put PDFs onto this piece of junk. When I first started iTunes there was only one menu available and it was hidden under a graphic in the upper left corner of the app. I \"Added files to library\" from the menu and selected my PDFs. This made them appear in iTunes under Books but it didn't put them on my iPad even after several syncs and prayer.\n\nThe solution(of course) was to select Show Menu Bar from the first menu to get a second menu (File, Edit, View, ...), then I could select View Side Bar to get a third menu I needed to add my PDFs. The first screen they appeared in was also labeled Books but it is obviously something different. After doing a sync the PDFs didn't appear in the Acrobat Reader where I expected them(why would they?) and I eventually found them in iBooks.\n\nThe PDFs still won't appear in either of the PDF apps I installed.  Why not? This makes absolutely no sense. Easy? No.\n\nI tried using the iPad search feature but it can't find the PDFs that are on the iPad even though they show up in iBooks. The files are there. Why doesn't search find them? Because iPads are over priced JUNK! Basic functionality doesn't work.\n\nApple products are supposed to be easy to use but they are far from it.\n\nVery disappointed.  Not designed well and lots of room for improvement. It makes me wonder what they've been working on for the last few years. It wasn't usability.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe more i use it, the more I hate it.  This weekend I received a message from iCloud Backup that has rendered my iPad completely useless.  When I tap OK to dismiss the message it keeps coming back. I can't dismiss the message, I can't interact with any apps, I can't power it down, I can't pull the battery. What am I supposed to do? Is this why everybody goes to the Apple store?"}

My husband enjoys crossword puzzles and uses it to help him with the puzzles. With practice we are becoming to like it more and more each day. It's easy to use and we use it every day to check the weather, news, etc.. This was a perfect item for us \"older folks\" to keep up with modern technology and keep in touch with family and friends."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "That is why I chose it over the newer models. I also bought the camera adaptors which work just fine. I highly reccommend them\nfor those who want to load photos directly from a digital camera. Get a word processing App (I like Doucuments2) and you can load text/data also. I have not tried to transfer video directly from my video camera but I plan to see if that is possible. Glad I bought the 64GB model.\nI have an i-Pod Touch for when I need a very portable  small, pocket size  lightweight device. However the battery life on the Touch is short compared th the i-Pad2. Of course one must have a laptop/desktop/printer for the heavier tasks. And now I have the i-Pad2 for medium size tasks with medium portability, increased functionality and plenty of pure digital fun/toy possibilities.  The operating system on this device is tried and true and by now has been tested over time. The screen and visuals are quite acceptable to these eyes. If you need more in terms of visuals then you may require one of the newer models. Otherwise the 'improvements' in the generations following the i-Pad2 are mostly cosmetic in this users humble opinion.\nI save 5 stars for perfection. This device falls only slightly short of that.\nHighly reccommended."}

I use android based phones.\n\nMy impression is that the ipad is very much like the iphone. Exactly the way you get into the phone you do the ipad. The icons are identical. So if you're coming from those other devices it's nice to have the same icons that you're already familiar with.\n\nOverall I'm happy with the unit. My only real complaints are the camera, speakers, no siri and lack of microsd card slot. The camera is horrible. I was shocked to learn the mexapixel that comes stock on this device. I don't think it's even 1 megapixel but for taking pictures it's really bad. Very grainy. Video recording is in hd so when the video does come out the picture is good quality. But the camera pictures are horrible.\n\nThe speakers are mono. I'm not sure why they are mono on such a flagship device. They sound ok but i figured you would at least get stereo speakers with something that costs over $400.\n\nLack of microsd slot. Now this is really bad. iphones don't have them either. neither do their ipods. it's a great way for apple to make more money since you can't upgrade the storage capacity. Android tablets and phones I'm able to add up to 64gb of extra storage. So with this device I'm locked in to what storage I buy. That's apple's deal so take it or leave it.\n\nNo siri. Upgrading to os 6 I thought that I would at least get siri. No. Apple won't allow that. Kinda sad for their once top of the line tablet. Ok but not really a big deal. Just would have been a nice feature.\n\nIf I were in the market for a new tablet now, I would seriously consider the Samsung Note 10.1. It can do everything the new ipad can do and more."}

I have also downloaded study help apps and homework apps that keep me up to date on what assignments I have coming up.\n\nI also love the plethora of games and other activities available for when I have downtime.

It also has problems connecting to Wi-Fi and to iTunes via a PC.  When connected to the PC there are messages that it can't sync or that the iPad is unrecognised.

I also wasn't going to pay at least $100 more to get a retina display since I view it as unnecessary for me- certainly not worth the extra money (even if I do have an instinct to have the latest and greatest). I decided that the iPad2 16GB would be appropriate to base my decision!\n\nThe iPad is a good looking piece of hardware - but I would say that the software left me feeling limited in what I was able to do.\n\nPros:\n-It's pretty - I do love a good looking piece of technology, and in that, the iPad does not disappoint\n-I like the multitouch gestures\n\nCons:\n-Heavy if you are reading in bed\n-Edges around the screen mean that I have to stretch my thumbs that much further if I am trying to hold and manipulate the device with both hands (you can always cradle it in one arm and manipulate with the other, but it just feels odd no matter how you do it)\n-No expandable memory - there are very few android tablets that do not offer this- get with the program apple\n-the App Store was not user friendly and was stubborn when connectivity wasn't fast\n-I find the settings app to be all over the place - settings for a single app may be in three different places (wouldn't it be nice to get into an individual app's settings from within that app)\n\nOverall, if you are looking for something simple to use and don't want to be able to do anything too indepth the iPad is a perfectly adequate choice.  iOS is very straight forward, and generally user friendly as long as you don't want to change settings for them (ie you want to use default settings)- otherwise, you may have to go on a hunt for the exact setting you are looking for (if it even exists).  I have no plan to get rid of my iPad - it works in a pinch and if I am doing something that may be hazardous to my technology, I would bring my iPad, but ultimately, I still prefer my android tablets!"}

The seller who I got this from gave me a great deal and he shipped it promptly and kept up with messages to give me info about it. It came brand new sealed in its box and I have been jubilant ever since I carried the box from the post office to my house.

I do my couponing on this iPad and I just absolutely love it. I have an android wifi only device and I wanted to work with the iOS system in order to see it for myself, and I love both, for my uses, each platform resonates perfectly for me for what I use it.

The controls are simple enough for even my parents to understand (lol, I love them, but they're a little slow on the technological uptake), but the functions it provides and the apps that can be added are able to provide complex operations tailored to suit any need.\n\nThe battery life is amazing. I can use it almost continuously for approximately twenty hours before I need to reuse it. Less if I'm using heavy graphics, etc. But even then it functions for around sixteen hours. It charges very quickly when turned off and plugged into the wall. The screen is very responsive, and the keyboard is not as difficult to use as I had feared (this is referring to the larger keyboard that appears when you turn the device side-ways. The smaller keyboard is more difficult, but not impossible). The only downside I see to the keyboard is that I can't select Spanish letters and accents.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have the ipad 4 now and I have had all of the other I pads except the first generation. I am a gadget girl who luvs Apple products. Honestly speaking, there is such a small difference between the 2nd and 4th generation ipads its not worth the upgrade. If you wear glasses and/or have trouble with blurriness and stuff then by all means upgrade to the 3, but the 4th generation is not even a noticeable difference.  It does have a faster processor but not Samsung fast, so if given the choice go with the 2nd generation if its a lot cheaper than 3rd generation. If the 2nd and 3rd are close in price go for the 3rd generation.\n\nTo sum it up\n1st generation- good for a kid\n2nd generation- good if you can get it for a lot less than the 3rd generation.\n3rd generation- good for people who can use every bit of clearness in reading/suffer from blurriness, cant find a good deal on a 3rd generation.\n4th generation- if you want normal speed service, its not super fast but it is average which is good.\n\nNow if you are trying to decide between the iPad and the samsung. You cant compare Apples and oranges. apples are apples and oranges are androids. the samsung is much much much faster and allows you to use flash, but in my opinion that is all.  The iPad has several things that are custom to work with iPad and don't function the same on the samsung tablet.  If i couldn't have the iPad I would definitely have the samsung.\n\nThe ipads, all 4 are being sold here for more than it is at the apple store. Amazon used to be my go to place for all apple products but it is a bit ridiculous that a dented,scratched and cracked ipad is being marketed for more than retail or same price as it was when it came out #GMAB maybe the price will come down after Christmas."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I bought this iPad for my two sons who are 5 and 3 because I was sick of them changing the settings and doing weird stuff to my laptop even with windows live family safety installed. This was my best purchase of the decade. The parental controls are amazing. I have Safari, iTunes, App Store, etc. all disabled. They have about 13 movies, 64 apps (mostly educational apps for letter tracing, coloring, baby Spanish, and so on), 28 books, and even Netflix for the weekends. They learned how to use it VERY QUICKLY! Within a day of showing them how to do stuff no more than once, they've pretty much mastered it. I have an Otterbox Defender case on it because they do abuse it quite a bit. When watching Netflix I hook it up to the TV so they don't have to worry about holding it. When we do leave the house and are away from WIFI they have plenty of content to keep them happy, esp in the car on long trips.\n\nI have an iPhone so I haven't use it for myself yet. If you have PC and are used to Windows 7 you will feel the iPad is extremely limited on what you can do. The onscreen keyboard is very awkward for my small hands when typing because the letters are so spaced out. My WPM drop dramatically on the iPad but pairing it with a Bluetooth keyboard I imagine will fix that problem, except that I've yet to see one that comes close to my Windows Keyboard. However, I just installed Windows 8 on my PC and I hate it so much I am considering selling it and purchasing an iPad for myself.\n\nI'm also saving up to get one for my 67 year old daddy whom calls me weekly asking me how to get the sound and video back working on Skype and how to get back to his FB page on his laptop. Some people just don't need a lot of settings to control!"}

Our laptop , and 2 iPhones work fine and pick up strong signals while the ipad 2 struggles to connect to networks even whilst sitting in front of a router . And it's not out router.. It's pretty much all wifi , whether my home, my parents or friends homes the thing struggles to get 1 bar . and as for 3G many times it says there's no SIM card detected . Doing much research I come to find out its a common issue with ipad 2 and Apple seems to not want to own up to this glitch .take it I. To apple and yes , they admit its a faulty antenna or wiring issue and its $250 to fix ( keep that in mind if you buy a refurb or pre owned w/o warranty )  I stumbled across an apple message board to a thread 130 pages deep of people all complaining the same issue . Just be aware that the ipad 2 when it does feel like working , is pretty great , but its temperamental and you'll never quite know if it will be a good day or a bad day with your ipad . The only temporary resolve is flipping it in and off airplane mode to stop it from freezing up, which I tend to do about 5 times a day . When it works , I love it .. Guess that's all I can say about that ."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have to admit I wish i would of thought of the idea of Ipads years ago and would of banked millions haha\n\nIpad (2) are a necessity  for everyone ranging from a business man, to a college student to a busy mom to a learning child. Ipads have everything you need all in one and what makes this thing so great is that it works for various and different types of people needs.\n\nOk im from the old school days, remember when you had to carry a planner, a calendar, a calculator, a to do list, a grocery list all in your purse and before you know it, your purse had so much weight to it!!\nNow ipads have all of that in one and more!!\n\nTechonologhy has allowed us this generation to be more efficient and less time consumed by having gadgets like this run our busy lives.\n\nNow if you don't have an ipad you may say you don't need an ipad, but I have to say you're wrong! Whether you like to read, watch movies, listen to music, play games, surf the net, do homework, ipad should be apart of your life and will make things so much simpler.\n\nFOR KIDS:\nIpad is a great learning toy, probably the best one made. It something about the huge touch screen filled with color that makes kids go crazy for it, and with all the learning apps it will trick your kid into thinking its a toy, when their learning and playing at the same time. It amazes me how now schools like elem and middle school will now be having ipads for their students. Its great because growing up i remember having tons of books in a big ole jansport the that weighed my back down.\nThere are tons of apps available for kids and if you want your child to learn or sit still at home or in the car get your child an ipad\n\nFOR STUDENTS:\nIf you're in college or even high school having 4 to 8 classes each class requires atleast 2 books and those books add up and are even costly. Ipad 2 can save all that and even save on buying those stocks of notebook paper. ipad 2 allows you to take notes and have all your college books stored on there. Amazing!\n\nFOR BUSY MOMS:\nbeing a mom is a very busy 24 hour job!!! And as a mom you have to keep up with appointments, doc visits for your child, birthdays, and etc. Instead of carrying a planner, calendar, and etc. Having an ipad and apps for your busy mom. schedule makes life a bit more easier.\n\nIpads are great for every age and even grandmas/grandpas. The huge screen allows us readers to zoom in and see everything clearly.\n\nMY EXPERIENCE:\nAt 1st when iPads came out i said i did not NEED one simply becuz Iam always glued to my computer! and than computers wasn't portable easily, i mean yes you can take it with you, but i mean can you slip it right in your purse...no! I never really left home with my laptop because i had to find wi fi and than carry it in its case, bring the plug, it just felt like too much! And than the iPhones came out! I'm like great portability, internet, email check on the go, Facebook, tweet, on the go!!!\nBut as great as the iphones are they are made for that....to be a phone and being on the internet and etc would drain my battery and i need it for calls. but the major drawback for me was the screen, iphone 4s screen seems sooo small compared to an ipad 2\n\nSo one day my husband convinced on an iPad 2 by getting me one, and i was instantly in love!!\n\nas much as I work on my computer at home, once I'm done and i want to relax and read n surf the internet n listen to some music i pull out my iPad 2 and i own a mac. I don't want a laptop on my lap while I'm laying down.\nAnd than the portability!! love it i can slip this in my purse, i don't need to bring a charger, case, and etc, just the iPad and I'm out the door.\nNow ipads shouldn't be computer replacements if you do most work on a computer. Now if you do a lot of homework, word docs, emailing on a iPad i would definitely suggest a keyboard, my hands hurt just typing this review\nI use my ipad for everything from listening to pandora to watching Netflix movies while I'm in the kitchen cooking. Its a great entertainment tool and saves money on electricity instead of having the tv and radio on all the time.\n\nBattery Life:\nWhen i first got the iPad 2 it felt like it took 2 days for it die even with heavy use, now after couple of months I have to charge it atleast once a day. on heavy use, it can last a couple of hours with no charge. So battery life is ok\n\nTouch screen:\nVery responsive touch screen better than other touch screen tablets. You don't have to press hard and it quickly responds to your fingertips!\n\nScreen size:\nI think the screen size is a bit big, but great, I mean you can see everything so clearly and zoom in and everything is right in your face.\n\nWeight:\nI carry this in my purse daily and im not complaining of shoulder pain. It does add a little weight to my purse but nothing where its like omg i have to take this out my bag. In comparison its like having 2 notebooks in your bag/purse\n\nCons:\nUnlike most other tablets they have hdmi ports, sd slots, usb slots ipads have none of those. It would be great if it atleast can take a memory card on its own and not need to buy a accessory to attach to transfer photos.\n\nCamera:\ncamera quality back and front sucks to me. The way phones are made now with 8 mp cameras the ipad 2 is in no comparison its camera quality is like a razor phone, when cameras on phones first came out. Like it does the job but nothing to print out and frame up.\n\nOverall I think apple did a great concept for technology by creating this and making our busy lives less hectic. iPads can be used for everything from music, to youtube, to web surfing, to email, to word docs, to reading, and so much more. If you're undecided to get an ipad, consider it. I don't think you'll regret like return it back, you ll be too in love. It is a bit pricy but than again all apple products are, and honestly coming from windows for over 12years straight and android phones for over 10 years straight i only regret not going to apple sooner.\n\nIts like having a nissan car 1st and driving a bentley after, you'll never want to go back to a nissan\n\nI love my Ipad 2, im using it now for this review and i use it every single day! happy shopping!"}

Turns out Verizon works great in my area and it is only 30$ a month with NO CONTRACT. I had no idea you could get 3G without a contract, for me that really sealed the deal. Now I am using Internet that is actually FASTER then wifi in my area!  Since in am savings 50-60$ a month, the savings will pay for the device in 10months and end up saving me hundreds upon hundreds of dollars. I love it!\n\nThe Internet is surprisingly easy to navigate and the touch keyboard is much easier to use then I thought it would be. If you are in an area where Internet is pricy and all you really do is surf the web, consider getting an iPad as an Internet device. I am pretty sure you can tether it to a laptop anyways and use Internet.\n\nFor me, the iPad is an important, practical and HUGE money saving device !!!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I bought this iPad 2 right when the new ones came out because I thought this was the best price.  My excuse to buying such an expensive product was that I was studying for the CPA exam and thought the apps would be helpful.  For me this is the perfect amount of space (I haven't run out yet and I have tons of games and other social apps and email)  I use mostly for personal and it is my favorite toy in the world.  I would recommend going this route instead of investing in a brand new iPad or other tablet.  You won't find as good apps as you will with apple.  I live in SC and bought it from someone in GA used.  It was like brand new plus i got a free case and screen protector which I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone who purchases one of these."}

I have not needed to pick the laptop up once sense I had it.  I got the Acer500 for Christmas last year and although it was nice it was very slow ever sense I did the last up date on it.  The iPad 2 is so much faster and does not loose the browsers like the Acer did. The only one era back on the iPad is it seems to me that a lot of the apps that re suppose to be free are very limited and require you to purchase something to go further in the game or to play it more than twice a day. When I used the Acer they had lot more free apps than apple does and for the most part when they are free they are not limited. I gave the Acer to my son he has lot more games to play on it than I do. Over all I love the Ipad2 mostly for its speed."}

The iPad 2 doesn't heat up.  The iPad 3 does.  The iPad 2 is a bit thinner and lighter (not much but notable).  Contrary to what I'd expected, the 2540x1480 screen is almost useless.  You still browse the web at only 720x1280, and most other commonly-used tasks.  Only a handful of games are made for 2540 resolution; therefore, it's practically useless given the iPad 2 is nearly half the price of the 3rd and 4th generation (which are both too similar to distinguish). While the A4/A5/A6 processors differ, it doesn't translate into real life differences in overall performance for watching videos, mail, web browsing, etc.  IMO the iPad 2 is s till the best tablet to come out in the past 3 years given that it's about half the price as those of its successors."}

Although I purchased a used Ipad2 (didn't want to still pay 500.00) I have to say it is worth it.  I have 2 kids 8 and 4 and as I told my father, there is just something about a device that you hand to your 4 year old and he can figure out how to use it.  He definitely knows more than my husband.  I use it for games e-mail, news.  My kids do games, math, watch Disney shows and fight over it, so much so that I might have to get another one but I am still not willing to spend full price will probably still look for a used model, works great for us."}

I like it because its quick and easy to grab and read blogs or look up a recipe and its not nearly as hard to type on as I was afraid it might be. And it is my very best friend when it comes to road tripping with our 3 year old. Road trips went from being a terror to a very enjoyable experience with the iPad (We got an Otterbox Defender case to keep it safe when the kid has it)."}

I'm pretty impressed by it, along with my lil daughter, when she saw it being charged, she screamed \"Ipad!!!\"  lol.  The only thing that bummed me out was when it came with no battery life at all.  I had to charge it while getting the Ipad2 all set up, needless to say, it was stuck to the charger for couple of hours, while I downloaded free apps. I did notice it immediately registered Verizon, but I have AT&T wireless internet at home and this was meant to be just Wifi only.  And not for long, it started asking if I want to add more data now or later before I can proceed with browsing.  That was an easy fix and I was able to modify it to just Wifi only. It then asked for IOS6 update while in the midst of downloading apps.  And after that, it was just smooth sailing and I made sure to enable some restrictions so my 4 yr old won't be buying any in-apps accidentally.  Read too much horror stories on that.  I did tell her to never click on the word \"buy\" because that would mean, it will take money away from Mommy!  LOL  Overall, quite happy with my big purchase.  I know this ain't the newest Ipad model but to me, it's good enough!\nAnd I am as pleased with the case and the screen protector I bought here in Amazon.\nUPDATE: 4/22/2015\nI am so disappointed to share that our beloved Ipad died after 2 yrs and 4  months.  It was all great until around the time when it upgraded to the latest IOS and it seemed to deteriorate from there, it still worked as normal, just a few glitches here and there and so I downgraded to the previous IOS version which seemed better.  But just one day, my daughter reached for our Ipad and then it just went black for no reason, no warnings, whatsoever.  And then I tried so many times to \"restore/update\" and just won't go beyond the restoring firmware.  I got the Apply Genius people look at it and the guy said, it's just time to upgrade as these are meant to be upgraded every 2 yrs or so (I'm shocked!), especially after paying for more than $500 new, they can replace it with $249.  So now, I'm contemplating on just buying a Samsung Tab 4, and can only hope that it will last longer than this Ipad."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Hardware:\nThe design of the iPad is exceptional with smooth curved edges and elegant textures of soft-touch metal. One problem that is apparent and has been stated multiple times is the weight of the device. It is too heavy to hold comfortably with one hand and the wrist may feel sore or achy after long periods of use. At the time of release, the screen was good enough for the average person to use. However, now with HD screens on devices less than half the size, the iPad's screen is seeming to pale in comparison. In addition, the battery life is quite exceptional. It lasts for weeks in Standby mode and also for long duration while reading or watching movies. Another point is that the cameras on the device are extremely poor, the resulting pictures looking too pixelated to view. You can forget about low-light shooting, because of a lack of flash and a poor image sensor.\nSoftware:\niOS has always been a novel user interface, not for the unlimited functions, but for the extremely easy to use USER INTERFACE. Heck, I have seen kids not even 2 years old who know how to unlock and play their favorite games on the devices. The app store offers an abundance of games, and \"productivity\" apps. However, these productivity apps are not that easy to use. Lots of fonts supported by Microsoft Word do not work on these apps and the formatting is often completely messed up when transitioning from my laptop to the iPad. Apple needs to get Microsoft to build a preloaded app that will be accessible from other places in the OS.\n\nOverall:\nIt's hard to recommend a product which is primarily limited to games, but if you're looking for an entertainment device, I would recommend the iPad 3 or 4 which have better graphics, a better processor, and a better screen. For the price, this is a good buy."}

This means that when you get a map of where you are going later, you can take a screen shot that will go right to your photos (camera roll) and then you can go there and email or text it to anyone else so they have a map to meet you there! You can do this with anything on your screen!!!! What a fantastic tool!\nAnother thing I love that people don't often know about is in the settings, general, accessibility section there are two things you can just turn on and they will read you almost anything out loud on your iPad!  One of them was created for differently abled people and one is more basic.  Speak over and Auto Text are the ones to look for respectively if you'd like to try these! They do take some getting used to.\nOne other thing I learned late in my use of this is that when you are looking at emails, you do not have to open them before deleting them.  If you just swipe your finger across one you know is spam a delete button will come up and you can delete it without ever opening it.\nI will add more fun tips as I learn them myself!"}

I can't stand the way that Apple nickle and dimes you for everything. Almost every App on iTunes costs money, where as most Apps on Play are free. My wife's iPhone 4S was having problems the other day, so I called Apple Care. I was told that I needed to create an Apple Care account for $29.99, just so I could talk to a customer service rep!.......Are you freaking kidding me?! What kind of costumer service is that? Ok, here's your iPad, want to personalize it?..........Too bad! Want to hook it to your TV, without buying a $100 Apple TV module?.............Too Bad! Want to use a YouTube app?.........Too bad! Want to use Google maps?..........Too bad! Want to use your Gmail account without it being gliche?........Too bad! Want to use Google search engine, without it constantly saying, \"Invalid URL\"?...........Too bad! Here's your iPad. Take it or leave it. You can't personalize it or do what you want, because we are Apple, the most powerfull cooperation in the world, and we know what you want way more than you do.\n\nMy next tablet or phone will NEVER be Apple,  but if all the people like being bent over and having it stuck in their pooper, by all means keep throwing your money at Apple. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice; shame on me.\n\nPeople keep comparing the hardware and software of current Android tablets vs. Apple iPads, but that isn't the issue. Apple tells you what you can and can't do with its devices. It's like buying a Ferrari and having it governed at 40 MPH. Why would anyone do this?"}

Now I know the old Kindle doesn't really have the features of the Apple IPAD 2 but, My Kindle is going on two years old and I really stopped useing it when I got my IPAD 2. But,furthmore my Kindle is still not broke, damaged, nor has any loss of batterie life,but it's A totally different story when it comes to the IPAD....First of all I have got say I took extremely great care of my IPAD but, somehow within 3 months it started to show scratches of the back of it. Moveover, it about the fifth or sixth month of owning my IPAD 2 It fell of a three and a half foot table(on to carpet) and the whole screen just shattered, the charging port was also almost totally destroyed and the little circle button that which is 100% the most important part of the IPAD even working at all was destroyed completely. I Called Apple and Asked if they could possibly fix my IPAD 2 64GB oh yea which my parents spent $730.00 dollars for and guess what they said........no, come on keep thinking-_-....................... they said \"for another $400.00 bucks we'll give you a new IPAD 2(the same one White/64GB)and we'll of course transfer the data from your other one to the new one.\" Well,as you could imagine my parents were't about to do that so I was and am stuck with a half broken IPAD and no way to fix it thanks Apple! It wasn't a total loss intil, I couldn't even use my IPAD anymore which happened about two months ago. Now since I can't use the Circle part of the the device I have to turn it off just to switch programs!! I end up now just useing my laptop for everything. I have IPOD and that's great but, APPLE's IPADS' suck badly. If your looking for a tablet for yourself or someone your shopping for, for the upcoming holidays I wouldn't buy a IPAD 3 but, a Kindle Fire HD or something; any will be better than a IPAD!!!WASTE OF HARD EARNED MONEY!!!!!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "An iPad-2 (64GB) purchased by me a year ago stopped working in May 2012 despite having been barely used. Apple, by necessity, replaced it at its Reston, VA store. That brand new replacement iPad failed again within just 4 months (Serial number DKVHG0MNDFJ0). The Apple store in Reston VA refused to fix or replace it, hiding behind a claimed \"3 month warranty for (new) replacements. (ref. its store manager, Ingrid H.), even though it was less than 5 months old.\n\nAnyone thinking of buying an Apple product should decide for themselves if they want to buy a product from a company that refuses to replace it a mere 5 months after it was obtained new from that company.\n\nFOLLOW-UP 10 MONTHS LATER: YET ONE MORE HARDWARE FAILURE THAT APPLE REFUSED TO REPLACE\n\nA new Ipad-2 from Apple's Reston, VA store failed again, 10 months after it was bought brand new directly from Apple. This time it was the main camera. Again, Apple refused to replace it even though it was a brand new product that failed within 10 months from purchase. Apple's self-service reasoning was again that the product, which was bought at a slightly discounted price FROM APPLE because of the previous reported hardware failure, had only a 3 month warranty (even though brand new).\n\nThat adds up to three iPad 2's with 64GB that failed within around a year, often much less than that and Apple refused to repair or replace them at no charge.\n\nYou can draw your own conclusions."}

Its great to look at, its thin, light, big,comes with 2 cameras,the screen is very beautiful, the colors pop. The sound is loud. But what makes the iPad 2 great is the APPS. Any app from cooking to taking the placement test to college to great games like BAD piggies,BASTION,Sonic the hedgehog, etc the app store has it ALL. You can also put your iPhone apps on it and make them bigger to fit the screen, you lose some resolution but that's nothing.\n\nPros.\nGreat looking\nThin\nBig beautiful screen\nSoftware is great\nAPPS anything you came think of.\nMovies\nMusic\nFace time\n10 hour Battery life with wifi on.\n\nCons\n16gb is not enough, apps are using retina display making some apps and games 2gbs per one.\nSound grill is in the back you need to cup your hand on it to aim the sound at you.\nGet credit card ready, you cant have fun on this thing without purchasing apps.\n\nWhen you compare the ipad 2 with ipad 3 all you get is the higher screen resolution the processor is the same and it has a 1 gig of memory on it,just a bit stronger to handle the screen, other wise there are no differences. You can do ipad 2 vs ipad 3 on youtube and see your self. Ipad 3 also comes with a 5 mp camera but has no flash. The ipad 2 cam sucks but it can record really good vid.\n\nAt the end the ipad change my life and it will help and change yours.\nMark my words the ipad (tablets) in the future will replace laptops in like 5 to 10 years."}

(YOU CANNOT JAILBREAK IPAD2 running iOS6)\n-The Safari web browser does not support Adobe flash (YouTube and pretty much all other videos online)\n-Most aftermarket \"iPad accessories\" that were NOT made by Apple will not work with this iPad (error message:\"accessory not supported\")\n-you CANNOT use a SDCard/USB drive with this iPad as extra storage with camera connection kit\n-The iPad can ONLY read certain file formats (avi mov tiff jpeg mp3 mp4 flv)\n-There is no File manager for this device\n\nInstead of jail breaking this device, save your money and buy another tablet for a little less money. You will not be missing anything special from the iPad, but you will gain a LOT with another tablet. Most newer tablets support SD cards as storage devices, and plays practically all file formats - that's pretty much standard.\n\nI thought APPLE was blazing the trail for others to follow, now I see that Apple is severely behind the competition with basic features.\n\nOverall: I have so much buyers remorse for buying this device, it'll probably end up on eBay (w/ the case) to get my money back.\n\nSincerely -  An un-satisfied customer,\n\n-C.Cole Phd"}

I love how fast i can save them. My computer takes forever to download things like that. All you have to do is push one button and you are done!\n\n  One other thing that i love about the Apple Ipad 2 is that you can set up a lock so nobody can get into it (like my little brother). I am the only one that can get into it! I love it.\n\n  I think the ipad 2 is truly amazing! You can do so much on it.

I've been struggling with Apple's email client for months, resulting in lost email and hours of wasted time! For example, I've searched for email that I can even see in the Inbox, just as a test, and the software can't find it. I've reverted to web-based email. Apple ought to be ashamed. Further, the OS led me to expect to be able to enlarge views, but that only works sometimes. Finally, the touch screen's copy, select, and paste functions are incredibly  frustrating. If you are clicking on small text and want to cut and paste, it's sometimes impossible to select the correct spot, and I've wasted a total of hours trying to do this basic function. An alternative would be arrow keys in the software (on-screen) keyboard, but there are none! Great hardware is one thing, but if the user is constantly frustrated by the software, then the overall experience is terrible. I've also given up, even after downloading Google's app, trying to edit my Google docs. I was ready to sell my used iBook and just rely on my iPad, but I am often soooo relieved to be back to an easier to use interface, that I'm afraid I'll have to keep both. Ridiculous!

An iPad is what has been my connection and has transformed my life exceedingly. It also enhanced every aspect of my life in many unique ways. My iPad 2 is reliable, family/school friendly and has also served as a memory book for me.\nApple has been in existence for decades, since 1976, and has grown to become our apple and nutrition of the day providing us iPhones, Macs, iPods and iPads. Apple has become a very trustworthy brand. Before I purchased the iPad on Amazon I needed to confirm that it was going to be worth my time, effort and money. I was blown away by the results of the reviews it had obtained throughout the years. Most of the reviews had given it a five star rating. At that point I knew I needed to buy my iPad 2. I anticipated its arrival anxiously because of the great qualities the product had. In the end, it was everything I had imagined it to be.\nMy brothers fell in love with it as much as I did, or possibly even more. I started exploring my iPad, downloading games and taking pictures. I am amazed at how much one little device can calm and contain children. I have four hyper active brothers and sisters and my iPad has worked miracles on them. They all sit down and as one quietly plays on the iPad, the others patiently wait for their turn. Before my siblings would be jumping and running around everywhere, yelling and fighting about everything. After that point my mom always carried my iPad and she is now buying one for herself. My iPad has become very helpful when it comes to school. I can take notes on it. I complete my homework on it.as type up my essays; watch instructive videos, take educational pictures and much more.  It also converts to a television on weekends. The screen is big enough to watch movies on it, browse Netflix and watch almost anything else. I have grown an emotional connection with my iPad and if you have a family or go to school, I know it will be the perfect product for you as well because it has the capability of helping one though any struggle that may arise.\nNot only is it an amazing device because of the things it can do but it is also easy to carry around. It is very portable and lightweight compared to carrying a laptop. A laptop does not have the same durability as an iPad. The iPad will hold many memories; it will be like a digital scrapbook that you can easily access and always retain. The iPad memory is what preserves those special moments with your pets, family and anything that is very dear to your heart. The iPad may be purchased with different types of memory according to what it will be used for. Also because it is so transportable it has a great battery capacity, making the life of the iPad longer. Lastly, the iPad's 2 cameras will capture many memorable and wonderful moments. The camera captures clear and vivid images that will last a lifetime.\nMy iPad has been a huge focus in my life. I believe it will be a long lasting item that I will not become bored of or toss in the corner like another abandoned electronic. I will always feel confident in recommending this item and what better place to purchase it than Amazon. Amazon has everything for a better, cheaper price; it is dependable and has the option for fast shipping if needed. My life truly has been blessed by this prodigious electronic. I agree with most people that this item deserves a five star rating. It has been two years since I have bought my iPad and I continue to be a very happy costumer, and will continue to be a consumer of apple products in the future."}

It came to a cross roads where my husband said if you can prove to me that you need it you can get it... Well need and want are two very different things but I justified the purchase by listing all the functions and daily life the iPad would help with. I got my way and when I got my iPad was thrilled with what I had expected to be a super functioning and helpful tool. I hadn't realized just how wonderful it would be. From movies, music, books, shows, orginization, games and productivity, the iPad has made waves throughout my house. My husband has since admitted the need for more than one iPad in a single household. He is on it almost as much as me! Our 4 year old has found it to be enthralling and has provided a great outlet for learning, and entertainment!  It is easy to use, even for the kiddos and has provided our family with a great helper on long trips. Some of the apps are expensive but that is okay when you are choosy with your needs. Most apps have a free version. I have gotten pretty fast on the keyboard. The iPad connects easily to available wifi and makes using the feature painless. I love my iPad! I reccomend a case immediately! With an investment such as this you can't be too careful. Usually you can find them online or in discount stores. Because the model is the same size as the previous iPad and will likely be the same as the iPad 3 screen protectors need not be outrageously priced. I have had issues finding all the books and magazines I thought there would be, however I expect in short order there will be releases. Apple is always coming out with new and innovative products, accessories and updates. Great purchase!!! I am very satisfied. I am a Android lover, and iPad almost has me convinced I need an iPhone on my next go-round!! We shall see! If you don't have an iPad, don't hesitate, get it, it is well worth the price."}

I bought it to read articles (both academic PDF's and online fare via Instapaper) and play silly games, and it has exceeded my expectations on both counts.  I had used both a 7\" and 10\" Android tablet (modded Nook Color and gTablet, respectively) and a 4th generation iPod Touch in the past for pretty much the same purposes as with the iPad, and found myself not turning them on and subsequently selling them, so I was skeptical of how useful I'd find the iPad vs. a laptop or desktop.\n\nThe advantage over the iPod Touch is just a matter of real estate.  The interfaces of the universal apps that I've used (ones that are available on both the iPod Touch and iPad) are much better on the iPad.  Not to knock Android, because I was admittedly using heavily modded versions of it and didn't have access to the entire Market (now Google Play, I guess), but there really are a ton of good apps available on the App Store.  There are good, efficient implementations of board games, silly puzzle games, a perfectly fine browser experience, good Dropbox, Instapaper, and Evernote apps; I could go on, but, really, there are just a ton of ways to use the iPad well.  I don't use it for much productivity (outside of Evernote and Dropbox), so I couldn't speak to that aspect.  But as a fun device that's useful to me, it's easy to recommend it to others.  If you want to spend the extra $100 for retina display, sure, go ahead and get the third generation one.  If you're struggling between the iPad 2 and other companies' tablets, though, I say go with the Apple."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Two months into owning it the glass got cracked and had to be replaced.  I had to replace the glass on an Iphone once before, not a big deal, totally different story on the Ipad.  I used a heat gun to soften the glue, but it seemed to just spread the cracks. A million flakes of shattered glass later, it was repaired, but it was by far the most difficult electronics repair I've attempted.  Apple will repair the glass for $199-$399, depending on the trim level of the Ipad.  Not only is that expensive for what essentially is a sheet of glass, but it's doubly insulting that the cost of the glass depends on how much the Ipad originally retailed for."}

I debated and after some time I got the iPad 2. Now I love it. I take it with me everywhere I go. To school, work, etc.. I use it to write, watch movies, check email, music, and the occasional games. The main thing I use it for is to read e-books. I like that I can have a Kindle app, a Kobo app, and a Nook app all in one place without having to have several different e-readers. I like to get certain books on certain apps, especially if the price for a book is more affordable than another. Having an iPad just makes things a little more convenient. I love it."}

I'm not going to treat the iPad as some sort of godlike creation, I am going to give the most straight review I can: the iPad isn't that great.\nHeres the things I will go into detail about: First of all,its got graphic capabilities that are about halfway to Playstation PSP and Nintendo DS, so its game's are pretty,but they aren't anything to get excited about.\nNext up, its App market is great. But the problem with it...well, I'll get to that.\nThe hardware itself.. that's where i got a bone to pick.\nIt slipped out of my hands one day and it hit my tile floor,and the screen cracked. And the same thing happened to my friend: but his was in a protective case. These things are fragile, which makes me wonder why anyone would trust these things to a kid under 5.\nSpeaking of fragile,ive dropped the ipad on -carpet- before and the video output on the screen turned green and well.. broken. If you want to see this for yourself: Google \"iPad Green screen problem\".\nFinally, I bet you are wondering: What about those apps I bought? My ipad still sounds usuable,so I still use them,right?\nWell, yes,and no. The thing is when I dropped my iPad,I was -moving- it. I still use all my apps,but the only good ones i got from it were universal: So when I say i'm using them,I mean on my iPhone.\nSo,to bring it all back home: Its just an overpriced piece of technology that you probably will stop using after 6 months, give or take how much you have to pour into it to find uses for it."}

The head supervisor there confirmed that the policy and design of Apple is such that it\n\nleaves no options with the customer, but to re-buy another piece even if the touch screen is cracked.\n\nIn my case, the screen got cracked due to keeping the iPad under my pillow after my night time reading. They requested me to send the picutures of the cracks\n\nand said that the cracks are due to external pressure and hence do not come under warranty, leaving me with no other option but to not use the Apple iPad\n\nanymore due to safety reasons. I am left only with this option because I don't want to buy another same product in its replacement. I can as well buy similar\n\nproduct from other company's offering.\n\nI even offered to give back the product and give me atleast some money. But they said that Apple doesn't have repurchase policy in India.\n\nIn addition, the other known Apple issues like unable to play videos ( due to non compatibility of flash player), low sound, no external ports provided like\n\nHDMI, USB etc. The maintenance is also a rip-off. Please note that you will have to buy seperate Apple accessories if you desire to have ports to connect\n\nwith other non-Apple devices. Even the sound is low to inspire customer to buy external speakers. The intersting thing is that other similar products in\n\nmarket have these things built in.\n\nHaving burnt my hands after buying my first \"Apple\" product, I have decided not to buy any future Apple products and highly recommend not to waste so much of anybody's hard earned money to buy such a product.

I didn't want to have to pay for a data plan and saved money on the cost of the iPad. That was the right choice for me. I use it all over the place with free wi fi spots so widely available. There are so many apps available that you can customize it for your needs very easily. This almost replaces my laptop computer. I hardly ever turn on the laptop anymore. The iPad runs faster than my laptop on most things online. I bought my iPad after falling in love with the one that I was issued for use in my special education class. I have been totally amazed at the things that I have seen happening in my classroom with the iPad. Any teacher, homeschoolers, or parent should have at least one iPad strictly for the kids. They are great learning tools with so many educational apps available--most free or low cost. And if you have a special needs child or student, then you doubly need an iPad for their use. It is much easier to use than a conventional computer for special needs children. And if you have a child with any disability on the Autism spectrum than you absolutely, without a doubt MUST have an iPad for your child. There are hundreds of apps designed just for people with Autism. If for no other reason than to use as an augmented communication system device, you must get this for your child with Autism.\n\nIf I am asked to name one flaw with the iPad, it is that it cannot be cleaned. The screen gets lots of finger prints and gunk on it--especially with children using it. And it will get scratches on the screen, no matter how careful you are. If using it in a classroom with lots of children it can be a germ breeding ground since you cannot wipe it down with disinfectant. At school, we stick them inside gallon zip close storage bags as a good protective covering that can be thrown out and replaced cheaply. Screen protectors are a must have accessory."}

Thanks to this purchase....we were even able to find out that we needed to get that outlet repaired.\nThank you for your immediate attention and i do apologize for any inconvenience or possible reduction to your excellent service.\nMy intention was never meant to do that but only have you contact us to advise how we could fix this issue.\nMany thanks,\nSteven Sousa"}

The ipad was in near perfect shape.\nThe ipad is very easy to use and navigate.  We downloaded a few apps, all our itunes songs, movies and books.  Very easy to read, quality sound and screen.  We just love it!\nWe are already thinking of purchasing another one for us adults because our teenagers hog it and we want to play!"}

However, this is my first tablet, and one thing I've noticed is that it's hard to do much besides watch movies, play games, and check email on them without some sort of a keyboard. The on-screen keyboard is just too clunky and hard to use to be very productive on. If this was easier to use, I'd give it 5 stars."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Most of the reviewers have given all the pros and cons, so I won't bore you with another list here. Like most people, I use the iPad 90% of the time on just a few Apps. For me, reading an ebook, checking stock quotes, and reading the news constitute most of what I do. It's good to have half a million Apps, but it's impossible to use that many, or even a fraction of that. I've compared the iPad to the Kindle for reading ebooks. For me, the iPad is the clear winner. In my opinion, the iPad is easier to read and is sharper, also the color is a plus. The Kindle is hard to read in low light. Maybe if you are outside, the Kindle would have the edge, but I never read outside, and I think most people don't (possibly some do at the beach). I have an iPad 1 with WiFi and 3G, and an iPad 2 with WiFi only. I think the WiFi is the way to go because of the cost savings. Sometimes the 3G is nice, but I don't use it that often. Bottom line, I can recommend either model. It's reliable, easy to use, and Apple has the updates to improve things or fix any bugs that crop up."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Was in the market for a tablet to be used during a planned international trip. I didn't want to lug mt 17\" laptop through airport security and on to my destination. After considering cheaper options, including Samsung Galaxy and small 10-12\" notebooks, I decided on the Apple. I've been using Apple IPOD's Classics for many years to store my ITUNES music library to play while at home, during trips and in my motor vehicles without any issues during the warranty periods and beyond. After speaking to both friends and family as well as reading reviews here on Amazon I decided to purchase the IPAD 2 16GB version. It's my first tablet & all I can say is it functions perfectly in my home using a refurbished Netgear 3500 wireless router for WIFI and a Bluetooth keyboard case from Trent also purchased here on Amazon. Screen resolution for the IPAD 2 is sharp & using the Safari browser for accessing my emails & internet browsing is easy to get acclimated to.  For those who wonder if they should purchase the Apple Care extended warranty I suggest no unless you are planning on dropping the IPAD on a hard surface!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "There's no question the iPad is an amazing device. Life is better now that I own one. With all the hype about it though I really expected it to be slightly better than it is.  It's hard to rate this exactly 3 or 4 stars so I'd rank it closer to four. Below summarizes why.\n\nPROs:\nIt's amazingly fast.\nAmazing battery life and the exact battery remaining percentage icon is a great feature instead of the usual cellphone-like icon showing a quarter, half, etc. Battery life is really one of the best things about it.\nIt turns on instantly and is ready for anything. Shuts down and sleeps just as quick. You almost never have to shut it down to undo a lockup. Notice I said \"almost\".\nLoads websites fast, and almost all apps work problem-free.\nTons of content available, much of it free or just $.99\nBuilt well and damn-near bulletproof case. It looks sleek and you don't want to put it down once you start using it.\nIt's lightweight and I don't notice it getting hot. So much more pleasant to use on the couch than a laptop. If you haven't spent an evening browsing the net from your couch with the iPad, you don't know what you're missing.\n\nCONs:\nSadly the cons are quite significant in my mind. Doesn't mean I'm taking it back but kind of amazing that Apple didn't address this with the ipad2. First, the lack of flash support on the iPad is HIGHLY ANNOYING.  I cannot overstate this. I have read many reviews and talked to enough fan-boys that tell me flash is outdated and isn't going to be used much longer, HTML 5 will replace it, on and on. To that I say YEAH RIGHT.  Flash is everywhere. Many major corporations and product companies use flash on their sites. If you cant run it, you WILL miss out on content. I had no idea how big this was until i got an ipad.\nIf you use amazon you need flash. Otherwise forget watching any product videos. To have to move to a desktop because my tablet won't do flash is unacceptable. I have heard that apple chose not to allow it due to battery life issues, but this doesn't seem like a valid enough point. It's probably more than this: political between adobe and apple. Here's a newsFLASH: how about just giving us the option to turn flash browsing off if battery life is the real reason? Maybe I'd rather have four hrs of battery life and be able to watch video than have 10 hrs of battery. This is the most glaring problem with the iPad and if you are in the market for a tablet, do your comparison shopping and check the android tablets before you decide. Wish I had. This is a problem I encounter almost every day.\n\nLack of a back button-there is not always a way to 'back out' of an application on the ipad as there is with other tablets, again namely the android tablets. Sometimes you get knee deep in an application and hit a wall, the only way out is to hit the home bezel button which means you have to close and  start the app over. With other tablets you just go back one step.  Not a huge annoyance, but annoying nonetheless and probably happens every other day or so.\n\nText ain't that sharp-I thought for sure owning an iPad I'd have razor sharp text just like the razor sharp graphics on the rest of the unit. Not so. Text is just 'ok'.  I just find myself having to blow things up sometime to view them clearly, and I have good vision. This may be a little knit picky... Text is fairly sharp as you enlarge and stretch content. I have read some other reviews touting sharper text on competing tablets though.\n\nSafari ain't that great either-safari is extremely limited and again apple won't let you have Firefox for the iPad. Basically I think safari provides a far less pleasing browsing experience. My main gripe is that safari will not 'wordwrap'. This means when you zoom in on a web pages the article will stroll horizontally which means extra work to have to read it. (Your home computer will wrap the text automatically, meaning the article or web page way get longer in length, but stays  only one screen length in width.... This makes for an easier reading experience).\nIf you do lots of reading online this can get tiring constantly having to scroll horizontally as well as vertically without word wrap. This isn't a problem on the kindle fire and android phones, I presume it isn't a problem on their tablets, either.\n\nThe war against Google-it's no secret apple and Google will one day be even more of direct competitors than they are now, and I find that gmail sometimes just will not open on the iPad. It hangs up and locks up the unit, and I mean LOCKS UP the unit rendering the rest of safari useless until I can get it to calm down and close out.  I have no idea why but gmail is the only website that gives me a problem in safari. It's annoying and I feel unnecessary.  it's not my Internet and not my WiFi either because it works on every other computer and device in the house.  There is a gmail app, but I share the tablet with other people and kids and I want my email access separately in a browser. Sadly gmail and the iPad don't mix and that sucks.\n\nSUMMARY:\nDespite the gripes above the iPad is still a marvelous machine, albeit not perfect. It's loads better than using a laptop for daily surf and email. You probably won't regret buying one, and if you do the high resale value means you'll have not problem unloading it. If you are a Google or android user, you do owe it to yourself to check out the android tablets side by side before making a purchase. I can tell you for sure that for browsing the net and reading articles, Google's android built in browser is loads better than safari.  I think the iPad had been incorrectly assumed as being vastly superior because it's apple, but it has some major flaws.\nHowever even with those it is still as a whole a superb machine. It's an amazing piece of technology and far superior for web browsing than a computer or laptop. Just a personal tip--if you're on the fence about what color to get, go with white. Black is cool too, but white will stay looking cleaner (black shows every fingerprint) and will not show little nicks and scratches on the case like black will.\nThanks for reading."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I did quite a bit of research before finally deciding on buying the iPad 2. The iPad was easily my last choice of all  tablets when i started my search, because i have had a bad history with apple and i swore off all of there products. I noticed a trend when i start going deep into the reviews and previews of competitor tablets, and that trend was that everything hoped to rival the iPad. There are decent alternatives, but unfortunately the iPad is still the tablet to beat.\n\nI choose the iPad 2 of the iPad 3, because for the upgrades from the predecessor were not of any interest. I take photos on a dslr, and if i want to watch HD videos then i can watch them on my laptop.\n\nSo far i am guilt fully enjoying the iPad 2. It has proved to me more useful than I envisioned: It's productivity apps work across multiple platforms, it's home to one of my favorite card games (magic 2013!), and it's internationally user friendly (chinese gf).\n\nMy biggest complaint is more on the OS and hardware side of things. I wish that the iOS allowed for exporting files to an external hdd. That would have made this product prefect for me."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "It's an iPad! The tablet that all other tablets are measured against.\n\nYes Apple has released the new iPad (or what the rest of us call the iPad 3). Apple Marketing, please think about your naming conventions in the future! But I still love my iPad 2!\n\nI use my iPad 2 just about every day. I mainly use it for reading email when I don't feel like pulling out the Macbook Pro. I also use it as an eReader (Amazon, Nook, Safari Books online, MacTech magazine, iBooks, etc). No it's not the retina display. But if you can't afford the retina display this is the next best thing. I can read this one just fine, so no upgrading for me.\n\nI didn't choose one with a data plan (would have been 3G when I bought this - last year), but I don't find that I need one. One hint on the data: If you can find a decent mifi data plan then you can just get the wifi version of the iPad and be done with it. Even so, I find wifi hotspots all over the place (including my house of course, which is where I use it a lot).\n\nThe camera is ok, but I use my iPhone for pics, so I really don't care. They could have substituted the camera for some other feature and I would have been just as happy.\n\nIt is an awesome game platform as it gives you more space to play with. It also works great with the Apple TV and streaming audio.\n\nYes, Android tablets are catching up, but they still aren't there yet. They don't have the price point of an iPad nor the consistency of the user experience.\n\nThe iPad is also a durable product: I have dropped mine, and only had small cracks appear on the bezel, with no affect on performance whatsoever. Still I recommend some kind of case. The smart cover is good, but doesn't protect the back. I'm still looking for my ultimate case.\n\nI have made it through an entire plane ride (cross-country 6 hr trip) without running down the battery completely.\n\nLooking for the best Tablet experience, don't want to have to figure out some convoluted interface? Buy the iPad."}

I have 4 iPad and an iPhone plus software and I have purchased at least 20 iPods.  I have tried returning the brand new iPad to both Target and Apple. Both dogmatically refuse to help me. Apple said I would have to pay $200 to replace it.  So far, no response from Griffin.  I am sick over this. Apple is horrible in terms of their customer service now.  The used to recognize stuff like this.  I have had so many good experiences with them over the years and now they've stopped standing behind their products.  The iPad should not have done this and the case should not have been so difficult to open.  The Apple store made good and sure that I couldn't buy an extended warranty by documenting the fact that the iPad was cracked.

Nevertheless, the release of the New iPad brings forth a new question: Should you buy the now cheaper iPad 2?\n\nThere are many factors to be considered when making this purchase. The main upgrades of the New iPad include retina display, faster processor, better cameras, and with iOS 6, siri. My family owns both the iPad 2 and the New iPad. Apple did not change the iPad much between these two generations. It kept the same battery life, the same thickness (almost), and the same design. Thus, it is a personal decision.\nThe devices are very similar, and most of the cons of the iPad 2 are fixed in the New iPad. However, is the upgrade worth $100-150?\n\nCons of iPad 2 and how the New iPad uses them:\n\nLack of Retina Display: When the iPad 2 was released, retina display had already been seen in other apple devices, like the iPod touch 4th generation. The general public was disappointed by the lack of this feature in the iPad 2. The iPad 3 had this feature. However, I don't really notice the difference. They both appear to have excellent displays. The New iPad's improved display can only be identified in rare conditions, such as viewing upgraded apps or sharp photos. Overall, the retina display in the iPad increases the memory many apps in the app store take up. For example, many iPad 2 users posted bad reviews about Monopoly HD when they had an update that increased the memory that app took up extensively. The update of Monopoly HD did not bring any new features besides Retina display. iPad 2 users were angry because now they lost memory without any benefits.\n\nLack of better Cameras: The iPad 2's cameras are terrible. They back facing camera is .7 megapixels. On a smaller screen this would be acceptable because it is still HD, but on a 10 in. screen photos shot by the iPad camera look pixelated. The New iPad is said to have 5 megapixel cameras. Even so, the cameras on the New iPad aren't that great. Look at the video I posted so you can see the difference yourself. The video is best viewed in full screen.\n\nFaster Processor: The iPad 2 has a decent processor and is capable of doing everything you can currently do on an iPad decently. The iPad 3 is faster, especially when loading apps. The upgrade is great but not necessary.\n\nSiri: With iOS 6, the New iPad will have exclusive new abilities like Siri. Although many are not appreciative of siri after seeing it on the iPhone, the fact that the New iPad will now have it suggests that apple will continue to do this. Apple's newest products will continue to receive features that older products won't have through updates. Thus, it may be a good idea to purchase the New iPad as another one is not expected soon."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I'll start by being brutally honest here and admit that initially I doubted Apple's Ipad when it was initially released in 2010. I didn't see much utility for it and frankly thought it was a bit silly and I wasn't all for it. I didn't see much use for it although I recognized it was a nifty, cool little device but thought it was a bit too much like an Ipod touch. Forward to 2012 I now am the owner of an Ipad 2 and loving it, I'm converted. It wasn't until I had the opportunity to spend time experimenting and playing with the tablet that I saw myself using it me and bringing it along with me, in short wanting one. I've owned an Ipad for a little over two weeks and with this time passed by I've had enough time to enjoy and experiment enough with this device that now seems to be the right time to review it. If you must know I went for the Ipad 2 simply because I liked how remarkably slim and light it was and although the Ipad 3 has the new retina display, to me it didn't significantly expand the second generation of Apple tablets for me to pay a hundred dollars more (money is important after all and is a deciding factor) to have the \"new\" product I decided. I read reviews and articles, comparisons between the second and third generations of Ipad and came to the conclusion that I'd be well off with 16 GB Ipad 2 and from then on would decide whether or not to upgrade to one of the future Ipads depending on my use and enjoyment of the tablet.\n\nYou can say all you want but no one presents and markets a product quite like Apple is capable of (and does). They're often criticized for how expensive their products are yet they are everywhere and well designed and thought and they're hard to ignore.  Apple had success with the Mac and Mac book and their different models, the Ipod, the Iphone (all with variations and updated models of the same product) and more recently with the Ipad. I'll be the first to admit Apple's gadgets and electronic devices can be expensive but I've also never had a problem with any apple product I've owned in the past.\n\nThe size is one of the best thing about the Ipad, it's neither too big nor too small and the screen is big, bright and clear and there's just so much you can do. The interface is excellent; it feels and works great, looks neat and simplistic and it's very easy to catch on. It just feels natural and anyone from a child to a grandparent can use it and understand the bare basics an enjoy it. The applications or \"apps\" as they are called are truly what MAKE the Ipad the innovative device that it is, otherwise it does a lot of what your Iphone/Ipod touch or Laptop/Desktop do which is still keep in mind, excellent. There are ton of apps for different needs be it for reading books and magazines, to taking notes, playing fun games and everything in between. There are ton of apps already on the market, some brilliant and very useful to some downright stupid and new ones are constantly being created. Many apps are free, not most but a good quantity are and the range from the 0.99-1.99-2.99-3.99... 9.99 etc.  There are apps that serve as business tools, diverse utilities, fun mindless games like the popular Angry Birds, there's Safari as the internet browser, you can set up you e-mail accounts, manage your bank account, make hotel reservations etc. The list goes on please believe! There's of course Itunes from which you can buy music, movies and more and have them uploaded instantly to your Ipad. You can also sync it to any existing Itunes account and select material to upload to the device. I also like that there is both an inward and outward camera like on the Iphone so you can take pictures of anything you see or yourself which is a very nice option I thought I'd mention.  Those programs and apps are all stored in your Ipad via the memory it contains whether it's 16, 32 or 64 GB and ultimately the amount of Gigabytes you have determines how much content can be stored on the Ipad. The battery life is roughly ten hours (of course depending on certain factors such the brightness, volume etc.) which is not bad at all and still better than my laptop.\n\nThese are just a few thoughts and suggestions if you're considering purchasing an Ipad.\n\n-  For me just the Wi-Fi model was fine. However, if you're often on the go and have a need for internet that can't wait and need it \"right now\" all the time without close Wi-Fi access available at all times then maybe you should consider getting a 3G model for just a little more $ with a monthly or pre-paid plan.\n\n-Another thing you might want to consider is the memory you're going to need. The 16G model has in reality 13.9 G (there is always a certain portion of available storage taken before even touch it) and I think for the average user this will be fine (besides you can always remove apps etc. and it does keep track of whatever you've downloaded in case you want it back). Most apps don't take up a whole lot of storage room although some are bigger than others. The same with music, it depends how much you plan to use the Ipad for music and this also applies to the books you buy and how many you plan to buy keep (although the books aren't as bad as the music and movies as far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't worry too much unless you're a hardcore reader who plans to store plenty of books).  If you're planning to upload a lot of movies or have/use a lot of data then perhaps a 32G or 64G model would be a better fit for you considering how movies can easily be over 1GB each. They're more expensive of course but may warrant the consideration if you'd rather have the larger number of Gigabytes but and not take the available space entirely than have one that's filled up soon after.\n\n-If you're interested in owning the latest thing and see potential great things about the Ipad 3 like the retina display and the upgraded processor you may want to go ahead with the newer model. Otherwise the second generation Ipad makes a viable option if you want to save a bit of money, other than that the two devices are basically identical and at first look no one could notice a difference between the 2 and 3. If you're considering either I suggest you do some research as I did, especially if money is an important factor in your decision and then decide for yourself which one it is you want.\n\n-Another somewhat big decision is the color choice, whether you want a black Ipad or a white one. Personally I went with the white one as I liked how it looked and it seems to me that most people I know own the black. The color is not all that important it's what it can do and the options it gives you although some will insist on owning either one color or the other.\n\n-Last you may want to protect the Ipad with a protective screen just in case (it's always better to be prepared) to protect it. You may want to consider purchasing a nice case to store and carry it and maybe even a stylus pen if you think you might be into that type of thing.\n\nIn a world where tablets are rapidly and steadily selling Apple's Ipad has in reality very little competition partly due to clever marketing but mostly due to the great product they delivered.  Don't have a lot of negatives, if any, to say for the most part I am really liking it and find myself using it every single day and it nearly replaces my laptop. It does close to everything I want to do with my laptop usually, for me the Ipad is now one of those things tht I can't live without (not literally but still!).  I made the jump and find myself enjoying the Ipad and like it for its portability which makes it great for travelling and carrying wherever I go. It's entertaining, useful and smooth.  I like that I can have so much in one convenient sized device that doesn't take up a whole lot of space, can access wi-fi, check my e-mails, play games and more. It's not as big or heavy as a laptop, does not overheat even when running for several hours and opens MUCH faster yet it's not so small that it's inconvenient to type or a little hard to read (or touch in the case of my cellular phone) and do tasks with a cell phone, it's a perfect balance if you will. I really don't have anything negative to say about my Ipad, it would be nice in the future to have place for a USB/SD slot and I believe that may be coming eventually.  Obviously I've been praising the Ipad a lot  and I don't regret my purchase, full marks *****."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "We recently ordered the iPad 2 from Amazon for our Daughter-in-Law's graduation from San Diego State University's graduate program in Nursing. We were very happy with the ordering and delivery experience. The iPad 2 is a viable alternative to the iPad 3 if pricing is an issue. The only sacrifices are in not having the Retina display and a lesser megapixel camera - the iOS software and apps are all the same. iPad 2 dimensions are the same as iPad 3 so all iPad accessories are transferable. We opted for the Verizon 3G version even though our daughter uses AT&T cell phone service. You can do this because iPad 3G service can be activated without a long term contract and in general Verizon's data coverage is better than AT&T in our daughter's service area."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I originally bought a first-gen iPad 3G, and was--eventually--very happy with it. I was a little disappointed with it at first, since it wasn't \"magic\" and didn't really live up to the hype. But I used it for reading books and watching movies, and slowly found myself using it for more and more things, until eventually it replaced my laptop (which, with my netbook, now sits collecting dust most of the time). Between my iPad and my desktop computer, they cover just about everything I need or want a computer for. As a result, I can't see myself buying another laptop, ever. (Or perhaps I will buy one some day as a more mobile replacement for my desktop.)\n\nWhen Apple brought out the \"retina\" iPad, they also dropped the price on the iPad 2, and I bought an Apple-refurbished iPad 2 as an upgrade for my first-gen iPad. But this time, I stuck with wifi-only, since the AT&T 3G was (and is) marginal in my neighborhood, and went with the bottom-end 16GB version because I had never used more than 12 GB of storage on the original iPad.\n\nFor three-fifty plus tax and free shipping, the refurb iPad 2 is a ridiculously good deal. Apple replaces the battery and metal shell--the parts most likely to be damaged or worn out--when they refurbish iPads.  I honestly can't tell that mine is a refurb. It looks and acts like it is brand new.\n\nThe iPad 2 is significantly faster than the original, which I notice mostly while browsing the web, but also with some games. It's lighter, and the battery lasts almost as long. Apple keeps adding features to iOS, so the iPad continues to become more useful. (Thank you, Google, for keeping Apple on their toes.)\n\nI look forward to upgrading to a refurbished  \"retina\" iPad when Apple brings out the next generation. But for now, the iPad 2 is terrific."}

Then I went on vacation a few months later and tried to activate the 3G only to discover that the iPad I received was only a WiFi model.  When I contacted the seller they said they couldn't even find the serial number in their records and were of little assistance.  It was like buying a car with heated seats in the summer, then in the winter you discover the heated seats aren't in the car.  Very frustrating.

Video streams efficiently and I like how quickly the screen self-adjusts from vertical to horizontal and back again. The images are crystal clear and the camera takes great pictures.\n\nI do have an issue and it is a common one with many people that have the IPad, it does not support Flash. Many of the things I do on the net and job-wise use Flash, so I will have to use other devices if an activity uses it. I also own a Kindle Fire and I like it too. Comparatively, the IPad does so much more, but it does come at a higher price. If you just want to be able to do basic web browsing, reading, and watch movies, the Fire is great.  If you want to go above and beyond that, IPad is the way to go."}

Its easy-to-use interface, vast app catalog, and marathon battery life bolster Apple's claim to being the king of tablets.\n\nOverall, I would recommend you buy this."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I bought an Android-run tablet (not from Amazon) a few weeks ago and tried my best to see its good points. I really liked its construction and novel appeal (had ICS) at first and continued to find reasons to improve it thru updates, useful apps, utilities, etc. All throughout I realized that I spent more time researching online for ways to improve  my Android tablet, than the time I was actually enjoying it. There always were issues that had to be remedied and problems that I had to seek  fixes for, the most significant of which was poor battery life and frequent crashes.  I finally got tired of \"babying\" my Android tablet and returned it promptly in new condition. That same day I bought an Apple Ipad 2 from a bricks-and-mortar store. Then I realized someting funny: that this was the third time I returned an Android device in exchange for an Apple.  First, when I returned an Android smartphone for an Iphone two years back. Second, when I returned an Android multimedia device for an Ipod Touch last Christmas. And now, my new Ipad 2 which replaced the Android. I am enjoying both stability and excellent battery life in my Ipad 2 -- and no more researching for fixes and no more \"babying\"!  Was buying the Ipad 2 more expensive? In terms of more cash out the pocket, yes; but in the long-run, I know that my Ipad will pay for itself. Now, I am not the brand conscious type and would readily buy a Coby or Emerson if it works better than a Sony or Samsung. Though I run the risk of sounding like a commercial, in this case of getting a tablet, the Ipad 2 won me over the Android simply because .........it's TRIED and TESTED and it's THAT GOOD."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "- Durability: 10/5\nWhen I say 10/5 I mean it. 3 days after X-mas, I dropped my brand new iPod 4G on a stone-tile floor (about 3-4 feet up) and it shattered (Apple replaced it free of charge :D), yet I'd still give the iPod 4G a 4.5/5 in durability. I've dropped my iPad 2 on the same floor maybe 2x. It got a tiny dent in the aluminum frame. I have dropped this iPad on wood floors, ceramic tile, stone tile, concrete, asphalt, you name it (yes, grass, too). I do not, nor have I ever, had a case on it. Sure, the edges of the case are dented beyond repair, but the screen and (surprisingly) the back of the frame are scuff-free.\nBUT!!! However you drop it, DO NOT drop anything on it! My TV remote slipped from my hand less than 1 foot above my screen, and it obliterated the home button, which I now keep in my pocket. I found it extremely ironic :)\nThe screen is impossible to scratch, however. Not gouge, but scratch. Since it's broken, I ordered a new screen. I decided to see how tough the screens are by scratching one with a nail (as in hammer and nail, not finger nail). It could not scratch it. Since I don't remember much of the Mohs Hardness scale, and I lack a diamond, it's somewhere between a 3 and 10 hardness.\n\n- Personalization .1/5\nApple has too much restricted customer customization of this product. As soon as you get this product, JAILBREAK IT! Jailbreaks are not illegal unless you install illegal sources. If you don't like any aspect of Apple's software designs, from there being a six-icon limit on the dock, to being able to run all your applications in windows or have Siri on the iPad, Jailbreak it. 99.9382% of the time you'll find the tweak you're looking for.\n\n- Size 2.3/5\nFrankly, 2 years ago when I was 13 I was flipping out to get such a big electronic toy. Now I think it's too freaking big. If you want a size that is good for presentations, yet still retaining good mobility, go with an iPad. If you want something you can stick in you're jacket pocket yet still be able to read, get something nearby the size of a Kindle Fire, even though I personally think iPad is 700x better.\n\n- Battery Life 5/5\n...\nI sometimes sit there and watch the battery drain, because I'm afraid if I open an app it will die (obviously this is at maybe 5-30% battery life). Yet sometimes I've found I can play for 4-5 hours, on a 3D game, no less, from 100% to dead.\n\n- Display ...\nThe part we've all been waiting for...\nHonestly, I'd have to say... 4.6/5\nI thought the display was absolutely stunning. That is, until I saw the iPad 3. I started seeing minor (MINOR!!!!!!) flaws on edges. This was mostly in a few particular apps designed for both iPhone and iPad, most of the other apps were just fine.\nIf you don't mind not having 3,100,000 pixels, take 786,432 pixels instead. You won't notice a difference, so long as you avoid iPad 3's.\n\n- Versatility 5/5\nI use this for school, homework, games, browsing the web to buy a new screen, FaceTiming with friends, staying up-to-date with friends, you name it. It even makes a good paperweight :)\n\n- Overall 4.85/5\nVery satisfied."}

Since I am no longer a full time student anymore, there wasn't much of a point other than just entertainment purposes.  All I really like to do is check my email, watch youtube videos, listen to music, and listen to church sermons and play chess.  I wouldn't want to spend a ton of money on something just for those purposes. A cheaper laptop I could have got but they honestly wouldn't last long.  So the Apple Ipad was a perfect idea and it works well for the unimportant stuff I like to do off the internet.  Well worth the price indeed!!!\n\nBy the way, I am not trying to be sarcastic.  The Ipad is a big help for me.  As I have went through periods of depression, I don't know where I would be if it wasn't for being able to listen to the sermons off the internet, nor communicating with my friends through email, and even getting my mind off of things through playing chess and listening to music.

I had all these plans and apps to transition a lot of my daily tasks to it, such as news, reading, and notes. However, one by one, I stopped using the iPad for each different task because it's inferior to my other devices in each category. When I read news, I'm either already at my desk and computer already, or I just want to whip out my smartphone and read a quick article. In terms of note-taking, the software options for notes and document editing on the iPad are absolutely awful compared to full PC programs. Furthermore, don't expect to use the touch screen for any real amount of typing. Its auto-correct is very prone to messing you up without you noticing. The list goes on.\n\nSo sure, it's a multi-functional device, but it's basically the worst of all worlds. It was fun at first, but as soon as the novelty wore off, it just became a chore to use the iPad for anything compared to other methods. I eventually realized I was only using it at all to justify my ownership of it, rather than for practical reasons. At last, today, I found it collecting dust in my room and turned it on to discover that I hadn't used it at all in a month.\n\nYes, it is a good looking, small, lightweight device. Yes, it has some useful applications. But for me, your average office worker and college student, is it practical or useful? No."}

I purchased and printed a receipt that also stated that the units were \"New.\"  When received I was disappointed to find that they were Certified Refurbished.  When I tried to return, the seller started an email argument over whether I should have realized the units were not factory new, then said I should try them out before returning, finally said that if I would return them, he would refund upon receipt.  No offer of a label, etc. Afraid if I sent them back I would never see my money. Felt like a bad ebay transaction, not the guaranteed, no-hassle returns that Amazon advertises.

Just the fact that when i want to check something out on the internet i just press a button and voil! All set. The size is perfect for me because I carry my iPad with me wherever I go. It's very easy to use since you have all your apps right there, not like other tablets that are NOT organized at all. I'm a fashion design student and my iPad has turned essential for me. Whenever i see something i like I save it and I look at it when I need inspiration. It became my notebook, there are pretty amazing apps like InClass and Noteability that let you make notes take pictures, video record, and even make voicenotes so it's very complete to me cause i get to have Everything really organized in my classes. The iPad speed is amazing. The keyboard is very easy to use and responsive! If you're a physical keyboard lover I recommend you the ClamCase. It's set up via bluetooth, and it gives you something the other cases don't; you can put your iPad in ALL angles you want since it's 360 degree!\nOne of the things that concern people is the printing...

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "After being tempted to buy a tablet for many months, when Apple introduced its new generation iPad and, at the same time, dropped the price of the earlier version, the iPad2 by $100 across-the-board, I jettisoned the thoughts about buying a relatively inexpensive Android device with a 7-8\" screen and bought the basic iPad2 with the minimal 16GB and WiFi only. Initially thinking that I was buying a new toy, a `novelty', I soon discovered that the iPad2 is much more than that. I use it for dozens of things I never imagined using one for and have become quite attached to it, especially when travelling or just sitting in my favorite easy chair at home.\n\nA great deal has been written about the technology and capacities of the iPads, so I will not waste your time reiterating them here. Suffice it to say that this one is the most basic model available. It requires a WiFi connection to operate and its total storage capacity is what seems like a `mere' 16GBs. My focus here is more on my personal experience with my first tablet. I am glad that I waited for the iPad.\n\nBeing a 65 year old man, my are no longer nimble enough to manage the tiny keys on a Smart Phone nor is my vision acute enough to read things easily on a 3\" screen.  On the iPad, however, with its 9.7\" screen and keypad that is entirely adequate, I have become quickly facile.\n\nThe limited memory is entirely adequate as I do not download and keep movies and am not an accumulator of music. The memory is needed to manage the necessary receiving elements of the various applications (Apps) that I choose to install the capacities for. Many are free, a lot of them cost between 99 cents and $3.99 and some cost more. The most expensive one I have is called \"Pages\" and is a comprehensive word processing and office management suite. Compared to the prices of `installable' programs, this is remarkable cheap. Some of my favorite apps are free, like voice recording capacities and \"GoSkyWatch\", an App that looks at the night sky through the out-facing camera and shows what constellations are there. It is like having my own telescope.\n\nThe 20-30 Apps I currently have installed have used about 2GBs of the total available hard drive. I don't expect to run out. The exclusive use of WiFi vs. 3G has a pro and con to it. In the Pro column, WiFi is pretty universally available in most places and it requires no paid data plan to access the internet and use all of the iPad's features. On the Con side of the ledger, the device is usable ONLY where there is a WiFi connection available. With 3G and a data-plan, the iPad can connect from anywhere you can access a signal for your cell phone.\n\nAt this time, for my own purposes, this basic iPad2 has been a rather surprising delight. I understand that the camera resolution on the third generation iPad is far superior, but what I see on this iPad2 is perfectly adequate for me - and, I expect, for most other people as well.\n\nThe price is right and the product is truly outstanding."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "After owning a Kindle 3 for a year, then a Kindle Fire for 6 months, I am now the proud owner of an iPad 2. I am also in a position to compare the two tablets without any bias at all.\n\nFirst, why the switch? The Kindle Fire is a great tablet, much better than the Kindle 3 in my opinion because of the apps, the small size, the backlit screen, and the Silk browser. And for many months now I have compared the iPad at a distance to the Kindle Fire, and I kept coming back with \"why would I want to spend $500 on an iPad when I can get a Fire for $200? I already own a laptop. Why would I need so much functionality in an eBook reader?  The iPad solves a problem that I do not have.\"\n\nBut the advantages of the iPad only become apparent once you own one. That's when the large screen makes you realize how much you squinted at the Fire's smaller screen. How much smoother the Safari browser works than the Silk browser. And how much better the selection of apps are on the iPad.\nSo, once the new iPad came out and the iPad 2 price dropped by $100, I found myself thinking seriously about it. And before I knew it, I had one. And I like it. I like it a lot.\n\nNow, I am still a huge Amazon fan and have no intention of leaving Amazon, so the thought of reading books and watching Amazon Prime videos on a non-Kindle device filled me with a bit of trepidation. Can it all work as nicely on the iPad as it does on the Kindle Fire? The answer is \"Yes\", with one rather large exception: video. Unfortunately videos (TV shows & movie's) downloaded from Amazon require Adobe Flash which Apple does not support on its mobile devices, so that was my first disappointment. But that's been my only disappointment so far and it turns out that it's not a huge problem at all. All of the other pluses of the iPad make up for that. There is plenty of video for the iPad: it's all on iTunes, and a lot of it is free. The Kindle reader works just fine on the iPad 2, in fact its nicer with the large screen.  Book prices on Amazon and Apple appear to be identical. Although the iPad 2 is larger and heavier than the Fire, it's not that much heavier to be a hindrance and I don't see it being any more difficult to slip into my travel bag. Battery life is about the same. But for sure the apps available on the iPad are a welcome sight compared to the Kindle, in both the quantity and quality. This is really where the scale tips heavily in Apple's favor. Sure, Android has thousands of apps available, but Amazon does not let you have them on the Kindle. You are restricted to only downloading the apps that Amazon has approved for the Kindle Fire, and that turns out to be a disappointingly small number of apps, many of which are of mediocre quality.  I would find myself eagerly searching the Kindle app store for the same apps that I enjoy on the iPhone, only to find that they are simply not available for the Kindle Fire. Apps like Skype, Evernote, TED, PBS,  Dropbox, Voxer, SayHi, WeightWatchers mobile, and plenty more. Another experience that is much better on the iPad is watching the news and documentaries while I walk on my treadmill. The bigger screen is a huge improvement and with all the great apps for news and shows, there truly is no end to what you can watch. Add to all of this the microphone, front & back cameras (I got the Wi-Fi only model), accelerometer, GPS and compass and you now have a much more exciting tablet experience. I also found the Silk browser to be clunky and unresponsive at times on the Fire with tabs & buttons that are small and difficult to press , while iPad's Safari is easier to use and has not even hiccupped. Could it be my wireless router? The distance to the router has not changed, just the tablet, so I call that a Silk issue.\n\nSo what really changed between the Kindle Fire and the iPad? Me. I thought all I wanted was a good eBook reader and for the last couple of years, the Kindle more than sufficed. But I found out that my needs and expectations have changed and I what I really want now is great tablet. And that's the iPad, hands down.\n\nCorrection: The wi-fi only model does not have a GPS module, but the location services and digital compass can still show your location for apps that need it. Interestingly, turn-by-turn directions in Mapquest work fine, as long as you have a wifi signal, but unless you have a good wifi signal in your car, GPS is pretty useless."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Tablets are toys. Last year, I dropped cable and considered either buying a Mac Mini or iPad 2 w/ Apple TV 2 and hooking it up to my TV. I decided to go with the latter. Not the best move. If you want to buy content from Apple, it may work well for you. If not, you have to jump through hoops or put up with inferior quality. Netflix and Hulu are not as good on the iPad or Apple TV as they are on a computer.\n\nIn fact, I should have stayed away from the Apple line in my HTPC decision... It would have been smarter to get a nice, Sony laptop and one of the WiDi boxes that allow you to screen share your PC with your TV. (I hate the idea of plugging a computer into HDMI with a cable). Then, when you play music from your laptop to your TV (connected to a stereo), you can trip out on the visualizer. Apple TV 2 has no visualizer. It has no horsepower. It is the iPhone 4 processor packed into a hockey puck with some output jacks slapped on. (from a design perspective, it is well done. I do think Apple are still great with hardware).\n\nTablets are toys. For example, if you want to surf the web on the iPad, there is no Flash. Indeed, people make a much bigger deal about this than it is, as most big websites offer the same content as h. 264 video. However, you will run into a few that only use Flash. You can use Photon, but it is not that great. It is true that Flash on mobile devices, even Android, is not very good. See? Tablets are toys!\n\nThe really bad thing is that Safari does not support the file upload html input element, so you cannot upload photos to sites like Ebay or Facebook. You need to use their apps. Why? Because iOS does not let you get into the directory structure. It is a toy. A consumer product. It is not cheap either.\n\nLike I said, I should have just got a nice Windows 7 laptop and WiDi, which would have been better than a Mac Mini and a remote keyboard. The laptop can go anywhere and can be used without the TV. Why not get a Macbook and Apple TV 2 and use AirPlay? Because it does not support screen mirroring! I think there are third party solutions, like AirPlay Server (not made by Apple). But we know why they do this. If it doesn't fit into the Apple ecosystem, they don't want to put in much effort to support it. After all, if they did that, you might watch Hulu instead of paying for shows on iTunes. I shudder to think that Apple is rumored to be interested in aquiring Netflix and Hulu. If they do, say goodbye to affordable programming...\n\nOh, and if you want to buy a show or movie on Amazon and watch it on your TV with the Apple ecosystem, good luck. It is nit really possible with the iPad 2 or Apple TV 2, and if you do it on the Mac, you either need to plug into your TV, or maybe try the third party AirPlay screen sharing software, if it still exists or is any good...\n\nThe Intel WiDi system, with devices made by a few manufacturers, had 1080p for years before the new Apple TV 2 did. If you project Hulu or Netflix, full screen, onto your TV, it is 16:9 widescreen, etc. It is simlly a better HTPC setup than I can think of! Total buyers remorse. I will have to put up with this iCrap for a few years, until it is totally obsolete...\n\nMy Apple fanboy days are over. Everything I own is Apple, and I see more and more bugs and more creepy \"lock you in\" behavior every day. Look, I am not going to pay $4 to rent a movie or $1-4 to buy TV episodes. Even though I watch maybe an hour or so of video programming a day, I would end up spending $100+. I may as well have cable.\n\nWith the new Apple iBooks scandal, we can all see the writing on the wall. I also see Apple products, even the Mac, becoming less computers and more consumer toys. I bought my first Mac because I am a developer and needed a POSIX environment. Many times I wish I just got a decent Windows laptop and dual booted Ubuntu and Windows 7.\n\nApple quality has gone downhill bigtime recently. The new updates to Apple TV have it crashing quite often.\n\nTo make a long story short, if you want to buy content from Apple, an iPad may be fine. But if you want Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, you should look elsewhere. What? The iPad has Netflix and Hulu and Apple TV has Netflix built in? Yes. But they are not as good as the computer versions. To watch Hulu on your TV, you have to do a convoluted process, to get it to work somewhat well:\n\n1. Close all the apps on your iPad\n2. Shut down your iPad\n3. Restart Apple TV\n4. Start your iPad\n5. Turn on screen sharing\n6. Start Hulu\n\nThe closing apps and restarting the iPad was recommended to me by Hulu support, but restarting the Apple TV 2 seems to help a lot too. See? This is worse than Windows! Remember when Apple products didn't need to be rebooted comstantly to work?\n\nThat will get you Hulu on your TV, but it is  4:3 with content cut off. The video is jerky and (appearantly due to legal reasons) they can only have a 15 second buffer size, unlike the Flash based version.\n\nI will say that the iPad 2 with Apple TV 2 can do some amazing things. A game like Metalstorm, played via AirPlay mirroring has a cool feature, where the iPad becomes a virtual cockpit (it is the game controller) and the game is on the screen. Indeed, an iPad with its gyroscope and acclerometer is a great gaming controller and gaming device.\n\nThat said, if you like stuff like World of Warcraft, you are better off with a Windows laptop. iOS is a great gaming platform, but I think Windows still has an edge for deeper games.\n\nI am not a gamer. This was meant to replace cable TV, and does not do the best job. I was warned. I read a review in some tech mag that said the same thing... But I figured between Netflix, Hulu and the AirPlay feature, I had all my bases covered. Yes, but it is not a quality experience. It is often tears before bedtime.\n\nIf you want a consumer gadget toy kind of thing, the iPad is fine. Probably better than any other tablet out there. But I now think tablets are a fad. The press claims they are the future. People tend to settle for less, if told it is hot stuff. Look at Twitter, or the fact that most of us listen to music that has lesser audio quality than a CD (which doesn't sound as good as vinyl!). Heck, I settled for 720p for this setup. I could have spent the same amount of money, got a quality laptop (like a Sony, forgetabout Dell and HP), and a WiDi box, and had a way better experience... Along with having a real computer that I could use independent of my TV -- something with a real web browser, real applications... I gotta say, even Safari on a Mac is pretty bad. The app looks nice, but web pages are often poorly formatted and there is a bug that prevents me from using my bank's website!\n\nSee what I mean? Apple used to be the one that had quality. I think they have become arrogant and are resting on their laurels. Additionally, the influx of lame consumers combined with \"democratic design\" has them spending more time on Twitter integration than develping a decent mobile browser that can do something as basic as upload a file! Forget about Flash! These things can't even upload files! How can they? You have NO ACCESS to the file system. Even then, they could let you access the photo roll, but they were too busy setting up iCloud so they could gouge you, and putting in system wide Twitter integration for the iSheep idiots.\n\nI used to get annoyed when the Phandroids and Apple haters called these iToys and the users iSheep. But there is a lot of truth to that.\n\nI bought my iPad 2 about 10 months ago, and I have buyer's remorse. I had way too much faith in Apple. Keep in mind, they want you to buy their content. They are not going to bend over backwards to create a decent Hulu or Netflix experience. Who knows? Maybe these are purposefully hobbled so you will get fed up and just buy the show from iTunes.\n\nBut iTunes is not great. I have a decent internet connection, and it takes 2 hours to download a 1 hour show. They do not stream. In my opinion, Apple is a terrible internet company. For example, you can't even watch the video, on Apple's website, about the new iPad on the iPad 2. I have tried to backup my iPad 2 for a month now, but their iCloud stuff is so dead slow, it fails after a few hours, and the progress bar says it will take 10 hours to back up -- just the basic backup!\n\nDON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! The iPad is the best tablet, but tablets are HYPED! You would be so much better off just getting a nice, small, quality laptop. Given the better integration of Windows 7 and WiDi for getting your stuff on the HDTV, I would even say, forget about getting a MacBook and Apple TV 2. Forget about a Mac Mini and a cumbersome remote keyboard. I have the worst Apple hangover right now! It just hit me how limited a lot of their stuff is... Their nice ecosystem can be done better, and with more options and choices. I'd rather play music from a Windows 7 laptop to my TV/stereo through a WiDi box, and get the visualizer and all that jazz...\n\nI used to really love Apple products, but they have lost their luster. I don't think products like the iPad 2, the new iPad, and Apple TV2 meet the needs of even most consumers. The fact that the Mac is slowly becoming a big iPad makes me wish I had opted for a Windows/Ubuntu system.\n\nDid I mention that after the iOS 5.1 release and the new Apple TV 2 update, AirPlay has crashed on me about 8 times. It probably would have crashed more, but I often just listen to the radio instead now. Pathetic, eh? Yep, Windows ain't lookin' so bad now!\n\nApple is becoming way too oriented to the average consumer. If you cut the cord (ditch cable) and go with Apple, you will pay as much, if not more for content, especially if you have a family. Don't buy an iPad 2 and an Apple TV 2 and expect Netflix and Hulu to work very well. This is no slam on either of those companies -- I think they rock! The best Netflix snd Hulu experiences are computer based (I have not tried Roku, Boxee, etc.)\n\nYou should not have to pay $4-5 to rent a movie, or $2-3 to buy a TV show. WTF? I don't want to watch that same episode of The Office more than once.\n\nJust like this iBooks scandal, it is clear that Apple is here to suck you dry. You were warned!"}

Huh.

There is even that dark square in it where LED could fit (like on HP touchpad). So, carrying it next to me, like iPhone, and checking email frequently is the way to go? That's ridiculous. If I am not using it, it's on the stand, not withing my reach. That's where LED comes handy.\n\nAlso, when I click on Mail icon that shows new email, it opens inbox, instead the email. - few clicks more are needed to see the email. Terrible approach if you plan to use multiple accounts and receive many emails.\n\nFinally, Notification bar is not popping-up new messages when I am working on ipad. Why?

The software and apps just \"seems to work\" as compared to the two Droid phones I've owned, which crash, do weird things, are sluggish when first turned on, etc. etc.  Based on this, I would not recommend an Android tablet to anyone except the most Technoholic Open Source types.\n\nThe bad: (blame AT&T, and spineless government oversight)\nI bought this because I would like to use it if I ever go overseas.  Since Verizon chose to go it alone with CDMA, and the regulators let them do that, you are stuck  in their little prison if you want to switch carriers.\n\n...So I was told by Apple that the data service would be easily turned on and off like a faucet, and that I would only have to pay for the months for which service was enabled.  Great!  I buy it in December, immediately use it \"off-campus\" in Albany on Christmas vacation (no internet at my Dad's if you can believe it...)\n\nSometime during Dec/Jan, I call AT&T to get them to help me figure out why I can not get in to the Settings->Cellular Data->My Account feature.  First call was probably 15-20 minutes long, and the AT&T representative is clueless.  It was like I was asking for help with my Acme Moon Lander.  I suspect it would have been news to the rep that AT&T actually has millions of iPad customers who pay them monthly.  In fact enough customers that AT&T should be able to escalate to iPad expert reps.\n\nCall two: Again 15-20 minutes, this time the rep is much more adamant that this must be an apple screen (though he could not explain why the AT&T death-star logo was on the screen I was having trouble with.)\n\nJust to play along, I call Apple, and waste some of their money and more of my time.  They quickly confirm this is not their problem.\n\nI finally figure out although it would be a nice-to-have to check my account out this way, I can go to their web site, and log in.  It takes me a surprisingly long time (about 20 minutes) to figure out how to \"suspend\" my service.  By this time, I've waited much too long, and I'm going to have to pay them for January, even though I had not used it then.\n\nOK, I pay my bills, and now I get a new bill for Mar 25 thru Apr 25.  Whot?  My service is suspended, why are they still billing me?\n\nNow the reason for the dud star: I call AT&T, and get Rep one.  They are very nice, and explain that even though I have suspended my service, I still have to pay.  What I really wanted to do is cancel my service.  Huh?  This is not sounding too much like a faucet anymore.  She suggests that what I REALLY want is what she calls \"Session based\" service.  She can not do that for me, but she will connect me with someone who will.\n\nI get put on hold where a recording LOUDLY tries to sell me a new Samsung tablet, repeatedly tells me I can  \"Re-think the Possible\" with AT&T.  Let me tell you, I've starting to rethink how badly customer service can possibly be at this time.  ....Oh yeah, and there is something in there about not wasting my time too.\n\nRep number two:  I recount my tale of woe,  but she will not have any of it.  First of all, I better get it straight: she does not know where this \"Session based\" phrase I'm throwing around came from, but I better get it straight.  Its called pre-paid, and we will hence-forth ONLY call it pre-paid, so we both know what we are talking about.  OK lady, you're the boss, Pre-paid.  How do I switch my account to Pre-paid, and how do I get this bill cancelled?  Well it turns out they can not just flip a software switch on their end.  The type of service (let's just call it a billing plan) is determined by my SIM card.  You've got that right: even though it is just a stupid serial number in a database, I've got to haul myself down to an Apple or AT&T store to get a new SIM card, so that they can bill me differently.\n\nApparently WAY back when, when I first signed up with AT&T (which I think I did on the phone because the web site was too confusing), THAT is when I went off the rails.  That is why my Settings->Cellular Data->My Account feature gives me a weird error which three different AT&T reps have not been able to help me with.  This woman was annoyed with me, and clearly thought it was all my fault for getting myself in to this predicament.  ....But she could not give me help with my bill.  Onward:\n\nMore annoying \"commercials\":  you know if this Rep loudly read the scripts from these commercials while we waited for the next rep, it would be considered really rude, and nobody would put up with it.  Give me the elevator music please.  I am not calling AT$T because I've got money burning holes in all of my pockets to buy another tablet, I am calling because they are not billing me the way I was promised.\n\nRep number three: I again recount my tale of woe (more quickly this time, so I don't p*ss him off).  Since I'm now in to minute 30 of this call, and that last rep was really testy with me, I'm now asking them to forgive three months for service not consumed.\n\nGuess what?  I tell this guy I apparently should have signed myself up for Pre-paid service way back when, and that is why I am here now, and he says: \"Oh you mean Session-based service?\", and proceeds to use the \"Session-based\" term that Rep #2 reprimanded me about for the rest of the conversation.\n\nSo AT&T: you are just awful.  When I communicate with you, you use the term \"Phone Number\" when it is not a phone. And I can not make phone calls (or text as far as I know)  You allow me to suspend my service, but you still charge me the same money, whats that all about?  Your own people disagree on what terms should be used for the billing plans.  And we are not talking innocuous terms like \"pop\" vs. \"Soda\", because this is how I got in to this mess.  I signed up for the wrong service, and I suspect it is because your poor discipline with terminology.  And that original error message, why give me a mis-leading error, just put up a screen which say \"You have got a XXX plan, and this info is not available under that plan\".  Cancel/Suspend, Pre-Paid/Session-based. Phone Number/device number.  \"Invalid account\"/Wrong plan type.  Pathetic. And I mean pathetic, not ludicrous, or shameful, or awful.  Pathetic."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "So I got my iPad 2 the first Friday of summer 2011, and have been loving it ever since. I use it for school (I'm practically paperless) and for entertainment. I got the 32 gigabyte model because I store a lot of apps, music, and pictures (from memebase, damn memebase.) With out further ado, here is my full review.\n\nHardware: the hardware for the iPad is great. The aluminum body is sleek, strong, and stylish. I feel very confident in the Apple build quality to withstand most of the things I do. The plastic on the iPad is very little, and still strong. It has your usual 30 pin port on the bottom, which is huge and I don't see why they don't make a smaller one. If you liked charging your iDevice with your computer, tough luck. Only a new MacBook Pro or a new iMac can charge the iPad 2.  I have neither. All in all, I give the hardware an A+.\n\nCases: A case is needed, however. My case is leather, and I got it for the magnetic closure, but for my use, it just isn't sturdy enough. Right now. I'm using&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/rooCASE-Dual-Station-Premium-Leather-Magenta-Case-Cover-with-Stand-for-Apple-iPad-2-iPad-3-The-new-iPad/dp/B004S4APTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">rooCASE Dual Station Premium Leather (Magenta) Case Cover with Stand for Apple iPad 2 / iPad 3 / The new iPad</a>&nbsp;in red; I couldn't find the red one in the product link section. With out a case or with a poor case, the corners will get pretty scuffed up and ugly. Also, on mine, the black plastic color part is kind of peeling. It's not that bad, though. Mind you that i'm a student, so I might do more things than you do. I recommend you get the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Speck-Products-CandyShell-Wrap-for-iPad-2-DarkLord-Black-SPK-A0418/dp/B004SGSH4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Speck Products CandyShell Wrap for iPad 2 - DarkLord Black (SPK-A0418)</a>. I just ordered it from Amazon $20 cheaper than from the Speck site.\n\niOS 5: I am at iOS 5.0.1, and for some reason, my iPad won't let me upgrade to 5.1. There isn't a huge difference, so don't feel like you are missing out.  The iOS is great. Everything is smooth, and the Internet browsing is great with the tabs. You can even split the keyboard in two and type with your thumbs, which is,neat, but not useful until you really learn how to use it. iCloud is also great. Every app I download on my iPhone gets downloaded on my iPad, and vice versa. Really useful. Still no freaking flash, though. There is an app you can download called Photon flash web browser, which lets you run flash programs. Really great for watching FLASH videos, if you know what I mean. I HAD TO! I HAD TO! I'm sorry. That was the dumbest thing ever, but you get what I mean. I rate the OS an A-\n\nBattery: I love the battery life, and at school, if I don't use it a lot, I can use it for another day. It has by far the best battery life of any LCD screen device I have. 'nuff said, A+\n\nSpeed: the iPad is super quick with its A5 processor, running apps like a charm and browsing the Internet sometimes faster than my laptop. Hell. It is  probably is faster than my laptop. If you want something fast, it's definitely something to consider. A+\n\nWeight: not too heavy, but not too light either. Feels perfect. It fits in my booksack, so it's good for me. A\n\nOne thing that makes me rate it 4 stars is the AirPrint or whatever Apple calls it. (my iPad recognized the word and spellchecked it, so I think I that's right) It's complete crap. There are only a select few printers that it can print to, and you have to jailbreak if you want otherwise. It's so dumb, and I print things a lot. I truly hate it. I am soon going to buy the network printing app on Cydia, so that will soon be gone, but still. Bad choice, Apple.\n\nAll in all, I rate the iPad 2 an A. If you want to save some money, buy the iPad 2 instead of the new iPad, but if it's your starting model and you don't care about the price, go with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Apple-iPad-MD328LL-A-16GB-Wi-Fi-White-NEWEST-MODEL/dp/B00746MXF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Apple iPad MD328LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, White) NEWEST MODEL</a>. The only reason to but this one is if you are price-conscious and the new iPad is too much for you.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "As someone who loves gadgets and still rebels against getting the latest thing, the iPad 2 at a reduced $399 was the route I took when the new iPad came out last week. After converting to an iPhone and iMac last year, it seemed the logical next step.\n\nThe true selling point is its portability. In bed, on the couch in front of the TV, and definitely for traveling-- this is a great accessory for checking email, Facebook, and browsing the web. The interface is simple and the display is great.\n\nThe cons are minimal. As an e-reader, the backlit display is hard on the eyes, so I find myself going back to my Kindle with its e-ink screen. And I find myself reminded that the iPad is probably closer to an iPhone than a computer because it limits some of the videos you may want to see since there is no way to get the Flash Player plug-in, which so many sites require. YouTube and Netflix, however, work just fine.  Although it was a bit frustrating when I paid for in flight wifi on a plane yesterday and still could not properly load a Netflix video.\n\nOverall, though, the iPad does exactly what it says it will do, which is giving the user a computer experience more personal and portable than a laptop. I have photos on it to share with others, church materials, kids books and games, magazines like People and Reader's Digest, and the all important Facebook app.\n\nIt is more of a toy than a necessity, but what a fun toy it is!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "This review is for the general public looking for something easy and fun to use. I am not a techie and have never owned a tablet until yesterday when I purchased a Galaxy Tablet 10.1. I loved this tablet but sadly had to return it this morning when I learned that I was lied too about its ability to connect with a VGA projector. After returning the Galaxy Tablet 10.1 this morning because of its inability to connect to a VGA output I found myself reluctantly purchasing an i-pad 2 16gb tablet. I wish I had never returned the Galaxy Tablet 10.1!! In terms of usability the Samsung Galaxy Tablet 10.1 was super easy and within minutes I was sending off emails using voice control, etc... however the I-Pad 2 left me flustered all afternoon long and I am still in shock at how complicated and convoluted getting things to work on it is. For instance 1) Before I could download anything needed for work I had to up-grade the OS! 2) Once OS-5 was installed I bought three (3) apps - keynote, pages, some PDF reader and I also installed Netflix for free. I had to uninstall and then re-install all four (4) app's in order to get them to work properly! Then, it turns out that the i-pad 2 doesn't actually charge whilst plugged into the computer via its usb port?! The battery life is not ten hours either! After five hours of feverishly trying to figure this thing out I was way below 30% battery life! I found the applications very frustrating to access and EVERYTHING forces you to use APPLE \"something or another...\" be it music, files, pictures, etc... if you like having options than avoid the i-pad... it leaves you feeling like you have been run over after all of the new accounts you have to set up just to get it to turn on properly out of the box.\n\nCompared to the Galaxy Tablet 10.1, everything was super easy to use and ready to go. It also comes with Polaris Office which is just as nice as keynote and pages in my opinion and it is FREE! I wrote a review about the Galaxy Tablet 10.1 expressing my disappointment that Samsung is being so short sighted about not having an VGA adapter for it. However, I could find no fault with the tablet itself or its applications. It left me feeling upset that I had to return it as I loved it so much. However, the Apple i-pad has left me so angry after hours of jerking me around that I can't wait to bring it back tomorrow and be rid of it. I also have the arduous task of trying to get my money back for the apps keynote and pages... both $10.00 each. I will confess that now that everything is finally set up and once you succumb to Apple's monopoly over how software is transferred from your computer to the tablet (i-tunes - sigh!) both keynote and pages preserve your Microsoft word and PowerPoint documents very nicely and is usable immediately. The Apple i-pad also has a proper VGA adapter for its i-pad... but it is NOT as user friendly as people or Apple itself makes it out to be and has left me wanting to return it regardless. Also, unlike the Galaxy Tablet, it does not allow you to swipe the screen from left to right and limits you to the basic top to bottom functions. The keyboard is inferior to the Galaxy tablet as well. For whatever reason the i-pad doesn't even have a tab key despite the fact that there is a blank space where the tab key usually is on any normal keyboard, including the Galaxy tablet 10.1! Just to type in some of my passwords I have to literally change the keyboard options three (3) times! This is only a problem for people like me who actually make full use of all the keys on a qwerty key board when making passwords and such. The Galaxy Tablet keyboard was simple and easy to use. It was as good as typing on a laptop keyboard! I also found some really great books for free via the Galaxy whereas most of the free books for the i-pad is just crap. Apple should spend more time on perfecting its products instead of introducing new ones every six months!\n\nBottom Line: if you do not need to use VGA projectors than buy the Galaxy Tablet 10.1. I am heartbroken that I could not have kept that one. Leave Apple to those who like it for what it is. Personally, I'd sooner use a Remington Typewriter than the i-pad!\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI returned this iPad and purchased the Galaxy 10.1 Tablet again and couldn't be happier! I found a way around the projector problem too which is great. My only regret is having bothered to purchase the iPad at all."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Apple released one of the most amazing products on March 2 of 2011 called the iPad 2, and it is one of the most innovating and exciting tablets to hit the market. This aluminum body tablet is 9.7 inches weighing 1.3 pounds making it one of the lightest tablets on the market today, also having an A5 dual chip processor and a 720p retina screen display. It comes in three sizes, 16,32 and 64 depending on your downloading and previous photos, videos and music you can choose which one will better suit you. This tablet is a must buy if you're a traveler or you want a cool gadget to play games, listen to music, take photos and view all your social networks. Not to mention its great battery life when your on the go except for when your watching movies. The layout on the device is very structured so if you're a user that has an android phone then you probably won't like the feel that the iPad gives out. If you're an apple fanatic like myself who has all apple products then this will be another great add on to the collection.\n\n  Working at BestBuy you have the exciting job to know all the truth behind products as well as being able to get them a little early, nevertheless I must say that this was worth the buy. For the average man it will cost you 500 dollars, 543.11 to be exact when you pay NYS tax but like I said it's worth the buy. Launching the iPad was a great idea, with this device you can take notes and organize your daily tasks and if you just want a device to use to play thousands of games (many which are free) then this is a great buy. Personally carrying a MacBook pro to school each and everyday puts a toll on your back, so the iPad is a easier way to have a device which can do most of the things your computer can do, it is called an accessory to a MacBook\n\n  Personally this has to be one of greatest products out there I remember when I first bought it and synced it using iCloud to my other apple devices. Apple has always had a classy start up screen, so all you see in BOLD letters is \"Welcome\" following \"IPAD 2\" in an artistic but simple manner. I take it with me to school every time so I can take my notes and search the web, not to mention going on twitter or Facebook while class isn't in session. Its your everyday \"Big cellphone\" you cant help but take pictures on it, or add music it to and buy dozens of cases as if it were on of your new cellphones.\n\n The only thing that might bother a user is that it doesn't support Adobe Flash player. Many people can't stand that because they love to watch movies and video clips and the iPad doesn't support it, that is the biggest upset with the iPad. With the iPad you have the option of accessing the Internet via Wi-Fi or threw a hotspot, which is convenient for the user making it easy to tap into the World Wide Web.\n\n Overall if this device is in your budget you should get one, preferably a black one, the white one gets pretty dirty (I have one). If you are buying the iPad make sure you also include a protection plan because if you accidently drop it (since your going to be having a world of fun) the screen will crack, it is made up of glass.  Enjoy!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Product Review: Apple iPad 2\n I would like to begin by saying I do not work for Apple nor do I know anyone who does. This review is my total honest opinion on the Apple iPad 2. I have no connection to Apple and this is my honest experience with the item. Advertisements and commercials for products are always circulating twenty four-seven. This also applied to the iPad 2. I had not paid much attention to the advertisements as I was satisfied with my iPad though at the moment, and had no need for the device.\nOne day while at home, my iPad fell out of my hands and was destroyed. I thought maybe to buy a new iPad but then the idea off an iPad 2 came to mind. The iPad 2 was released on March of 2011. I had seen so many commercials and heard so much about it. So the next day I got my little piggy bank, emptied it out and had about $28. Yeah, there was not too much money in my little piggy.\nI got the rest of the money from my parents, and the next day went to the closest Best Buy and bought a 16GB iPad 2 black tablet for the price of $499.99.  I also bought the 1 year accidental protection plan for $99.99, knowing my clumsy hands and bad luck. So I had spent around $600.00 on a single item. So this Apple iPad 2 I had gotten was supposed to be near perfect on the amount of money I had spent on it and way better then my iPad. Now the Apple iPad 2 was 7.3 x 9.5 x 0.3 inches in dimensions. The iPad 2 was really thin and really comfortable to hold.\nIt was also lighter then the iPad, not by too much but still a bit lighter. Now that I told you a little bit about the physical characteristics, let me tell you the new features that make this item unique. Apple doubled the RAM in iPad 2 from around 256MB to 512 MB. This will help process graphics for games and help deliver images faster. The two cameras is also a better feature over the old iPad, one in the front facing you and one in the back. Now these cameras aren't anything special. Their digital effect is just alright and the pictures will not come out too crisp or clear. The cameras do help with video chatting and FaceTime.\nOne of the biggest disappointments I had with my iPad was that it was never available to multi task. The iPad 2 increased RAM allows more applications to be open at once. Now these applications are available in the app store. There are close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps that work on the iPad 2. There are also Google Books, iBook, Nook, Kindle for readers on the iPad 2. I can use all these apps all day long because of the battery life.\nThe iPad 2 battery last over 10 hours constantly on. The need to recharge battery constantly is not necessary. Now as great as the iPad 2 is with all these qualities, every coin has two sides, this applies to iPad 2. There are several things still needing improvement on the iPad 2. There is no USB support for mass storage. There is also still no dedicated SD card slot. For example, if I wanted to put pictures onto the iPad from my camera, I would need an adapter.\nAnother distinguishing flaw in the iPad 2 is the lack of flash support. There are many programs that require the iPad 2 to run on Adobe Flash. The Android tablet on the other hand does allow Flash support. The iPad 2 is a great and impressive tablet that can be purchased in the market today. The iPad 2 is probably the best on the market at the moment. The iPad 2 isn't perfect and the price may be a bit high but if you can afford it, I would recommend it for you."}

I am so glad that I ordered the Verizon version. The data package deals are not too bad and can be purchased directly from the iPad. The apps are super fun and the apps that I will use for my kids are not that expensive, between 2 and 5 dollars. A note to self would be that IBM Lotus notes is not immediately compatible with Mac. The installation looks as if it happens, but the id name does not install. There are Youtube videos with instructions, but I am not the most computer savvy so I do not necessary understand the instructions.

He heard about Apple's new iPad and wanted me to give him some ideas of what techies thought of Apple's retina display in the new iPad. So I went to a website I read frequently and one that is popular with the most technologically literate people on earth: tomshardware dotcom. I am including\nsome of the comments voted highest and left by tomshardware frequent readers. It is hoped that this will assist\nintelligent readers on deciding if they should get the new iPad.\n\nHalcyon:\n\n\"Why didn't someone besides Apple use this most excellent screen first? Heck, Samsung makes the screen...you'd think they put something as nice in their own tablets.\"\n\n------\nBystander:\n\nFrankly, I find it a little ridiculous at the resolution of this screen. I'd rather have the extra battery life and if you use it for games, they are probably going to have to use it at half the resolution for performance reasons.\n\n2550x1600 on a 30\" is about as crisp as i can see. Why do we need that on a 9.7\" screen?\n\nI won't refuse the added resolution, but I'm not sure there is much reason to spend extra money for it either.\n\n------\n\nIcemunk quoted by Del35:\n\n\"Back in 2010 when Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone 4, he claimed that the human eye stooped discerning the individual pixels when the pixel density is 300ppi. Hence he called the display on the iPhone 4 the retina display, which has 326ppi. Now we go forward in time almost two years and after all the human eye stops discerning pixels at 260ppi not 300ppi as previously stated.\n\nAlso the phone I mentioned was a Nokia N900, at the time I also had a iPhone 3GS and a Xperia X1. Without knowing I had two phones with retina displays.\"\n\nThe retina display is such a load of nonsense. The hype is designed to draw technologically subliterate zombies. The bottom line is that I simply can't imagine using a device like the new iPad that prevents me from experiencing fully close to 30% of websites due to its proprietary infestation (no flash and no java support!). On another note, I am happy that Samsung manufactures the retina display for Apple. Obviously they see no need to create a hype around it and seem not to be pushing it on their devices. For me the 1280 x 800 Pixel Super Amoled display of the the Samsung Galaxy Note is more than I need. Thanks but no thanks Apple. Give me connectivity, openness, and produce a device with a better that 2 in 10 repairability ratio and thus almost impossible to repair, also throw in a micro sd slot and price the device reasonably and I might consider it. Till you do that you will just be producing overpriced junk for  zombied morons using your logo as a shield.\n\nEnd of story.\n\n-----\nIcemunk:\n\n\"Fact of the matter is Apple displays are nice, and set a good benchmark, however they have been surpassed by newer technologies and better resolutions on many fronts. Most new super phones surpass 300ppi using LCD, OLED, and LED technologies.\"\n\n-----\nIcemunk:\n\n\"Yup, Samsung make excellent handheld displays!\n\n----------\n\nVladislaus:\n\n\"My old phone with 3,5 inch 800x480 apparently also has a retina display long before Apple introduced it with the iPhone 4. Apparently all of a sudden, retina displays became much more common overnight.\"\n\n----------\n\nThe Dane:\n\n\"Apple's retina displays still uses IPS panels. Much prefer lower resoution SuperAMO LED if image quality is important.\"\n\n--------\n\nIcemunk:\n\n\" There are plenty of phones with \"Retina\" display (above 300 ppi). For example, the Samsung Galaxy Nexus has a 4.65\" OLED screen with 316 ppi, however it is not advertised as \"Retina\" display, because that is a marketing gimick which Apple has a copyright for. OLED beats LCD hands down by the way.\"\n-------\n\nShaod:\n\n\"Of course it has 316 ppi \"strictly speaking\" - ppi being simply the number of pixels it has per inch. That's ignoring that PenTile actually looks (subjectively) better than a regular display of the same resolution, while using less power because it has few subpixels.\n\nAnd sorry but 'retina display' is a marketing term. Like you point out it is completely subjective upon other factors such as where the screen is held and how good the eyesight of the user is.\"\n-------\n\nIcemunk responds to Watcha who  seems to work for Apple:\n\n\"You sound like a person who has little experience outside his Iphone and Apple products.. that is unfortunate, I believe you are caught up in the marketing of Apple and confusing it with science. It's tough to be a truly critical thinker when you are a fan boy unfortunately... hopefully you'll realize this in time. Good luck.\"\n-----\n\nIcemunk responds to Apple employee Watcha:\n\n\"I'm not going to argue about what a \"Retina\" display is, because that is a marketing device which Apple holds copyright. If you would like to argue facts, than I will present them to you:\n\nOLED is a superior display. Lower power, higher clairty, better viewing angles, true blacks and superior contrasts, higher resolutions, more advanced, higher quality, vibrant colors. LCD does not compare, even if you make up some marketing term about \"Retina\" display. OLED wins hands down, no matter how you spin it. And just so you know.. Apple won't be using LCD in their next Iphone, Samsung will make them a nice OLED display for it instead.\"\n\nDel35 replies to Icemunk:\n\n-------\n\n\"Watcha is unforuntetly lacking in real knowledge, and lost in the vast marketing machine produced by Apple. He reads his \"science\" from websites such as[...] which talks about nothing but Apple.. I feel for people like him, they don't realize they are being manipulated by marketing.\"\n\nI agree. In fact Watcha is even lacking in the basics of logical reasoning as evidenced by many of his past comments. Watcha does not even know  what  a contrapositve statement is or what a converse statement is or what  a tautology is. To illustrate his total lack of logical skills,  I recall a discussion with Watcha where he/she claimed that Apple made better product because more affluent people purchased them. I replied to him that his argument was akin to the claim that slavery was a better economic system because wealthier people held slaves in the 17th and 18th Century. He could not see the fallacy of his claim and held to it. Now it is known that Watcha works for Apple. So he is just working to put food on his table albeit in an immoral and anti-intellectual  fashion.\n\n--------\n\nIcemunk:\n\n\"I'm not going to argue about what a \"Retina\" display is, because that is a marketing device which Apple holds copyright.

I think people who have read this far can make an intelligent decision on whether they should buy the hyped \"Retina Display\"."}

The iPad 2 is sleeker, much thinner and lighter.  These are big differences if you plan on doing a lot of reading on the device and need to hold it for extended periods of time.  The camera is a nice-to-have addition.  The iPhone 4 has a better camera and is easier to use when taking pictures - the iPad is a bit bulky to use as a camera.  Also, for me, cellular connectivity is a must since I travel frequently and can't always rely on a WiFi signal.  Cellular data plans are about $25/month, so if you don't need it, you can save a fair bit of money.  I might still recommend getting the device with the cellular antenna - you can enable it when you need it and cancel data plans when you don't.  Lastly, the question of white or black face... while white is a new option with iPad 2, I actually find the black frame preferable, especially when viewing video content."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "My wife just bought an iPad 2 and I had the Transformer Prime (Android Platform).  I have researched for quite a long time before I bought my Prime (since returned) and actually had THREE Android tablets that all just did not cut it for me.  If you are on a lower budget, than certainly there are MANY Android tablets out there.  If you have the funds, I highly recommend the Apple iPad 2 as it is about the the best \"overall\" tablet out there.  Whether you like Apple or Steve Jobs history or politics, the iPad 2 really is a quality machine.  Nothing is perfect, and nothing will please everybody, but in comparing devices, I now have the experience with both platforms and will pick iPad as the best of the two.  For the average user, that being the non-technical, non-programmer type, and the person NOT looking for a tablet to replace a PC or laptop, the iPad 2 is a wonder.  Yes, it sure has different operating system and is \"closed\" compared to Android.  Yes, it does not support Java or Flash, but these are small issues. If you MUST have Java or Flash, or \"hate\" Apple, then no matter what anybody says, you will not like any reviews of the iPad 2.  If you are a regular \"Joe\" or \"Janet\", then read carefully all of the reviews and see that the iPad is a great unit if you can afford the extra dollars.  In a few weeks, the iPad 3 is likely announced and the prices for the remaining iPad 2's will likely decreases.  When that happens grab one immediately.  Of course, if you have the money, might want to consider the iPad 3.  People seem to get personal about an Apple product, either love them or hate them.  I have no bias, I own an Android Phone and will likely keep it.  I own an Ipod Touch and will probably keep it.  Since I have an Ipod and have had one for years (since they came out) I am familiar with iTunes and the iTunes Store.  If you are one of these people, you will find the interface of the iPad 2 familiar to you. Almost every application I used on the iPad 2 (my wifes) as compared to the Android devices was better.  Yahoo and SKYPE Video chat was far superior.  I did not use the camera on the iPad 2, but then again, a camera on a tablet is of NO importance to me.  Ease of use and quality are, and I choose (now) the iPad 2.  I simply like the Apple OS on a tablet better than Android. A huge difference I found with the iPad 2 over Android, is that with the default Android Sync program, I could not SEND an email from my exchange.  I could RECEIVE only.  After finding this out, and searching online, it is common issue and you need to download a third party SYNC program to accomplish this.  The iPad 2 works flawlessly out of the box sending and receiving exchange emails. I almost bought an iPad 2 in the beginning, and after three different Android units, am certainly going to purchase the iPad (2 or 3).  Things might just work out better anyway now, that a new iPad will be announced shortly.\n\n*****update: I did purchase an iPad 2 on March 7 after the price was lowered by $100. I can safely state again that this is a fabulous device and I highly recommend. If you want a quality built tablet that can do pretty much all you would need, see if you can pick up an iPad 2 32 or 64 gb one before they are all gone."}

I paid full price for my 64gb iPad and I don't regret it, even as long as it took me to save up for it.  I love getting digital copies of movies (like from the bluray discs you were already going to buy) and putting them on this bad boy to take wherever I want.  Not only can I enjoy it, but with an AV adapter cord I can plug it up to any HDTV and entertain everyone.\n\nObviously the apps are awesome.  There practically is an app for everything.  My biggest consideration in getting the iPad over an ereader was the amount of books you have access to.  On an iPad, you have access to all the iBooks, Kobo books, B&N nook books, and amazon kindle books through their own app.  Just recently I found one negative thing about having an iPad over a kindle.  I'm not talking about the fire either, because I really don't know enough about the fire to compare point for point, I'm just talking ebooks here.  The Kindle lets you borrow one book a month I believe it is for free (the kindle version ones that are listed as $0.00) if you are an amazon prime member.  Until recently, I wasn't a prime member and I wasn't disappointed until I found out that the iPad app for kindle doesn't offer the free borrowing of books unless you have an actual kindle. This may change some day if enough people complain, but as of right now, it isn't offered.  So if you are fine with paying for all of your books or you aren't willing to pay to be a prime member, then you have access to more books on an ipad.  Oh another cool thing is that you can download the overdrive app which you can rent digital books or audiobooks from your local library with your library card for free.  I love the audiobooks because I'm sure you know how expensive they are to buy, and unless I know for sure its a good book, I'm not willing to drop $20-$45 on an audiobook.\n\nAs for the internet on the iPad, browsing is a breeze, saving pages and bookmarking is a breeze.  The only thing is it does have some problems connecting to little mom and pop wif signals for some reason.  Its a known problem and I imagine the iPad3 will be better at this.  Other than that there are no complaints from me for the internet.\n\nPrinting from the iPad is so cool, too.  Even if you don't have an airprint printer, you can still find an app to print to almost any printer through wifi.  I haven't found one yet that I couldn't print on using Print Bureau.  Its really cool and after you figure out how to use it, its pretty simple too.  I can even print to my huge commercial printer/scanner/network fax machine at work.\n\nI also love the adapters for cameras that lets you easily plug and transfer pictures/video directly to the iPad to send or post somewhere online.\n\nIf you have an iPod or iPhone, the charger that comes with the iPad is much stronger, and charges your other apple idevices much faster than with the chargers that came with them.\nOverall very happy with my purchase!!!\n\nI wanted to add an update, my schoolwork is online and I did find a way around the adobe flash problem so that I can access all of my school assignments and take tests from my iPad.  It's like a Firefox app, at least it syncs with Firefox, but it is called mercury. No flash problems =)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Well, well, well, I finally bought an iPad. I was originally against it and bought the Asus Transformer first. It's not the greatest thing in the world, but the operating system and features are good in their own way. I might one day sell it and buy a Prime, since I like certain things about Android better. The main part that I don't like is the speed it operates at. (Lags a lot). But this is not about Android; it's about the iPad.\nOk, so the main reason that I was against the iPad and Apple products was it's use of slave children to make them and the exclusivity of the operating system. Slave children part? Still an issue. But the main reason I ended up buying one was the promise of Apple of making textbooks for college available on them. I had waited so long for it, too. How convenient is that? No more aching back and such. SSOOOOOOOO nice! And the exclusivity of the operating system? It's honestly not as bad as people had made it out to be. For the most part, things work really well in all aspects for the iPad and there's really only a few websites that I have gone to that don't play videos. I don't play flash games, so that's not an issue. But for reals, the iPad has the best apps and they're tailored specifically for it. The best example is Splashtop, which remotely accesses your computer. It certainly is NOT optimized for the Transformer. The greatest thing is that I can actually watch movies streamed from my computer in bed! When it comes to the processing power, I have been told that the components are the same for both of my tablets, but the iPad plays streaming video a whole lot better. And it also does just about everything better.....except for the widgets. Why can't Apple design widgets for the iPad??? That's why I like the operating system of Android better, plus you can customize it better and surf files better and generally get a more user-oriented experience. Once again though, the apps for iPad ARE better and there ARE more of them, (though not a whole lot). It quickly does hit a brick wall and the apps fall dramatically in quality. Most of the apps that are truly useful, you will find on both. Itunes though is a b*tch and I truly do not enjoy using it. This cuts back to the point I made that files are easier to work with on Android products. If you can climb successfully up the iTunes learning curve, you will do well, but you shouldn't enjoy it, if my experience is anything to go on. So, that's about all I have to rant about right now. If you're like me, you'll just blow your money and get an Apple product AND and Android product. Both good, but for now, the iPad is MUCH better. I swear, sometimes I just want to hold it and fall asleep with it. Oh, and just as a quick afterthought, the next generation of iPads need more quick-access buttons, just like Android. There should be a menu button, back button, (that doesn't just take you back to the main screen), and a quick-switch multitasking button. If they did this, the iPad would truly reign supreme. Thanks for a great product!"}

It is not Adobe but the producers of products and the cable company offering only those products.\n\nNow that we got rid of the only negative, if you have an iphone the learning curve is nil. A few exceptions; the Safari screen is a tad different. Some apps are grainy in the 2x mode. Response time can be a tad slow in comparison to other devices on the same Wi-Fi.\n\nI actually played with dedicated book readers before the purchase of this device as that is the primary goal. The top reason for iPad 2 over the readers is the viewing surface. Oh sure on a reader you can pick you r font. However you cannot pick your screen size.  As long as this is my reader of choice I though \"oh well why not make it the computer as well.\" So being familiar with the iphone there would be almost no learning curve.  I picked the max memory (not that I will use more than a fraction of it) just because if for some reason I wanted more in the future  I would not have to worry if it was upgradable or not. I intend to use the blazes out or this iPad 2 until the technology no longer exists. So far I have only used the Wi-Fi part as one little security password and it was actively accessing the net.  Will pick 3g if traveling is in my plans.  So far there are just too many free hot spots. I may be over planning but it gives me peace of mind to know this animal can communicate with both systems and has plenty of memory.\n\nMean time I am having a great time using this system primarily as a reader.\nAs a reader this by the way does not require Adobe Flash.\n\nOwning an iPad as playing around with its potential remids me of the saying form `four quartets' by t.s. eliot\n\nWe shall not cease from exploration\nAnd the end of all our exploring\nWill be to arrive where we started\nAnd know the place for the first time."}

The current nano is like magic.  (see Clarke's Law).  I just don't like Apple and their holier than thou and more superior than thou attitude about their products and operating systems.  Our household just got an iPad against my better judgement.  Seems one of us drank the Koolaide.  And as I suspected that person was in for a rude awakening when it came to making the iPad work and play well with others (the rest of the world that is android and windows based) and don't get me started about not supporting Flash.  So if all your friends and family are using iPhones and iPads you will have no problem communicating with them ( well not really) .  Apple has a chip on their shoulder about not invented here.  They have proprietary apps and programs that only work and play well with same ( AirPrint, FaceTime, etc) .  Brother for instance makes one of the most popular and economical mono laser printers in he world and AirPrint does not work with it.  You have to buy an app to be able to print from iPad to Brother products. Fail. Speaking of buying things, you will have to buy the smart cover and you will probably want the back smart cover and an a longer power cord and then a carrying case. Also with all things\" I \" you cannot add memory, no sd card slot but that's ok you can store things in the cloud.  I don't want to store things in the cloud.  Clouds invariably blow away or want to charge you rent. There's a lot of things to like and a lot of things not to like about the iPad as with any tablet I have seen.  You are paying a premium over the competition to join this club and the iPad is just not as tricked out with ports and interfaces to the real world as I would like.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I wanted a lightweight tablet to replace my laptop for school use, and after weighing my options, I decided on the iPad 2 over the Samsung Galaxy tab because Apples appstore is alot more disverse and expansive. With apps like Documents To Go Premium and AVPlayerHD, it has almost completely replaced my laptop, and with the keyboard/case combo I ordered it does word processing just fine. It does pretty well with the battery life at mid-level brightness and does terrific on the lowest setting. Im a college student and Im at school for 12 hours on some days, so time is factor and it delievers.\n\nMy one big issue with the iPad is its restrictions. You can not drag and drop items like word documents, images, pdf's, videos to and from the ipad without itunes, and because the iPad natively only plays a few video formats, you have to download an app if you want a broader selection. AVPlayerHD plays all video formats and actually allows you to drag these files into the sharing option in itunes. Which makes the device feel much more diverse, but the app isn't free, its about 1.99 in the appstore. Aside from the restriction issue I really like it, it hasn't completely replaced laptop, not until your able to transfer items without the use of iTunes.\n\n(There are apps like AVPlayerHD that allow you to transfer  certain incompatible files to your ipad through iTunes, and Im sure there are some for photos and documents, but you'll have to hunt for them down and they probably won't be free -but I guess if you can afford to shell out the dough for an iPad you can afford a couple 1 to 10 dollar apps-)\n\nI reccomend the iPad, its pretty cool.\n\n*Update*\n\nI got my iPad on Jan 14th, 2012 and got rid of it February 12th, 2012. It was very fun for awhile, but once the novelty wore off the iPad was just too limited. I needed more freedom and less hassle, I'm not a fan of going through iTunes for virtually all data transferring. I cant hook anything up to it without some ridiculous peripheral; something as simple as an SD or MicroSD card slot could have made a world of difference, my model was 16 gig. After the iOS 5 update it was down to about 13, and I had over 6 gigs for music and 8 for previous iPod touch apps.\n\nI had tons of movies but with the limited none expandable space, I could only fit about three compressed movies at a time, which were greatly smaller in size compared to anything offered in the iTunes store. I greatly regret not going with the Galaxy Tab, which in terms of flexibility is incredibly superior, however, neither of these are computers so the overall flexibility I prefer might never be on that level. That said, I probably should have gone with the Galaxy, although, the iPad was very fun, it wasn't for me."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Like most, I've been smitten by the iPad since it was released about two years ago. I couldn't justify purchasing it for the longest time because I couldn't figure out how to work it into my technology regime. It's not computer enough to replace my Macbook Pro, and it's not phone enough to replace my iPhone 4 (not the 4S) running 5.0.1. When you factor in the price, I just couldn't convince myself that the iPad was something I couldn't live without.\n\nThen the iPad 2 comes out: front- and rear-facing cameras were new, so I could use the iPad for face-timing my mom 14 hours away, but it was essentially still something halfway between a computer and an iPhone.\n\nFinally I came to a point where I could spare the $600+ dollars to purchase the cheapest iPad 2 capable of connecting to at&t's 3G wireless service. I ordered this iPad on January 18 and just received it yesterday, so keep in mind I've only had this thing for one day.\n\nImmediately, I can see how the iPad 2 may come off as seductive; essentially, it's a ginormous screen surrounded by a thin frame of black or white (depends on which color your purchase--I bought white) with a single button. There's no denying that it's sexy. When you turn it on (after plugging it into iTunes and completing the necessary setup) you're blown away by the crisp screen--though it's not yet on par with the Retina display of the iPhone 4 and 4S, it's a luscious screen and only the seasoned 'techie' would notice this slight inferiority. The iPad 2's screen is still better than most if not all its competition.\n\nApple also has a leg-up on its competition with the easy integration with iTunes. If your like me and you bought the iPad 2 to simply be what it is: an iPad, somewhere in between a computer and an iPhone--then you likely won't be filling your iPad 2's limited storage with your entire music library. I opted to sync with only my recently played music, top played music, recently added music, and a few recent playlist I've made, which I'll probably replace with newer playlists as they're made. I did sync with a fair amount of the same apps that I have on my iPhone, a handful of movies, none of my ringtones (what would I use them for?) and ended up using about 9GB of the 16GB available on the iPad 2 model I purchased. And in all actuality, after the firmware files and other junk Apple puts on their products, only about 13-14GB of the 16 are available to use out of the box.\n\nAs expected, web browsing and email are where the iPad 2 shines. It's very smooth, the screen shows side-screens and sub-menus simultaneously, which really makes this thing quick to use. I used a Best Buy gift card I received for Christmas to purchase Apple's aluminum wireless keyboard to connect to my iPad 2 via Bluetooth and, although the keyboard makes me occasionally reach over for a mouse (you must still use the touch-screen mechanism despite having an actual keyboard), typing is a DREAM on here now! Facebook is also very fun to use with the keyboard setup versus the onscreen keyboard or even using the Facebook app on my iPhone. Don't get me wrong, the onscreen keyboard of the iPad 2 is very usable, but I find with a screen as large as the iPad 2's, I'd prefer having an actual keyboard so as to utilize as much of the screen as possible for web browsing, emailing, Facebooking, and anything else.\n\nI wish Apple would make it more clear that for at&t 3G models, the SIM card is not included and will need to be purchased separately. I haven't gotten around to going to my local at&t store to pick one up, so I'm not too sure how much a SIM card will cost.\n\nAll things considered, so far I'd say I'm happy that I purchased the iPad 2. It's only receiving 4 of the 5 stars because, although I'm very comfortable with using it and definitely see myself using it on a daily basis, it hasn't replaced any of my other electronics. In all actuality, it's become another separate electronic device that I've incorporated into my routine for its own purposes. The 4 of 5 stars also reflects the price; I understand that you 'get what you pay for' (which is definitely the case for the iPad 2, as it outperforms the competition on every aspect except price), but for a product to ADD to your routine rather than to REPLACE or SIMPLIFY, I think the price could come down just slightly. Even a difference of $50 might be enough to lure in some hesitant customers."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "In November of 2011 I bought the Amazon Fire mostly because I wanted to stream their Prime movies.  The screen for movies and tv shows was fantastic though the wifi connection would keep dropping in the middle of streaming. The more I used the Fire the more I realized that it wasn't able to give me what I wanted.  It did not have a large enough amount of device itself storage space,I could not turn the backlight down low enough to make it comfortable for me to read, I could not download the BN reading app to read my BN book library, and the screen really wasn't large enough to comfortably browse the internet or read magazines.  I started looking at the Ipad 2 and after what I saw from a co-worker's IPAD I gifted my Fire to my sister and bought my own Ipad.  I absolutely love it!  It has given me everything that I wanted - most specifically the fact that I can have the Amazon reading apps and BN reading app on the device and can read both bookstore's library on the same device.  I had purchased the 16 mb but two days later upgraded to the 64 mb.  The backlight can be turned down to being almost off, browsing is great, reading my emails is easier now. The wifi connection is solid up in my room where the Fire would keep dropping the connection. I am amazed at how much you can do with this device with the different apps.  It is always with me!  True it is heavier than the Fire - it's more like reading a hardback book, but the print is big and the backlight is softer on the eyes.  Also true is the fact that I now cannot watch the Amazon Prime movies and tv shows, but ITunes has a lot to offer even though you have to pay for it.  Small trade-off in my opinion since I am mostly a book person - not a movie person.  Now if Amazon were to make a bigger Fire and take care of some of the issues I mentioned above - the Fire could definitely give the IPAD a run especially having the Instant Prime Video behind them but for now I would recommend the IPAD 2 over the Kindle Fire.  p.s.  My sister really likes the Fire and is very satisfied with it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "After a few weeks of playing with and trying to make my iPad2 functional and integrate it into my life etc. it suddenly dawned on me that so much of what I was struggling to do ... was to make my iPad into a... notebook computer... that does the things that the Mac OS already does so well!\n\nOne of the first things I did was ... BUY A Keyboard! Mac Bluetooth.\n\nThen it was the infatuation with \"apps!\" \" GOLLY look at this! It allows me to print a document!!\"  And other absurdities like that.\n\nYou know? The stuff that we all have been doing well now for 10 plus years, with the buggy nightmares of the 90s, that used to make one pull hair out in Windows' frustration, now thankfully long suppressed... .\n\nI used to refer to Mac devotees as \"Mac Bigots!\"\n\nBut after dealing with Windows security issues, and instability through every Windows generation... I finally took the plunge with a Powerbook and never looked back. If I became less than a \"Mac Bigot,\" still I learned to love Apple's integration,  stability, sleek looks and creative tides... that happily washed over Apple's countrymen and America as a whole, like that great wave from the first iPhone.\n\nBut, this is an iPad review and although I don't desire to denigrate this generally great piece of technology or even review it seriously, I  do want to you to seriously consider a Macbook Air before the iPad.\n\nWeight is a great part of the allure of the lightweight iPad...but... the new Macbook Air is only about twice as heavy and since it may be likely that the first thing you may buy is a Bluetooth keyboard... that may not be a deciding issue...because if you wish for your, oh so cool... purchase to actually be a functional input device of text... and you took touch-typing in high school... the plunking at an iPhone or iPad's screen... with one's THUMBS... or the dull end of your fingers... becomes a tedious devolution of functionality.\n\nAnd this is the real core of my criticism of PADS in general. They are at this point clever receivers of information but clunky input...ers. One looks for app after app to do the simplest things...  and then we say... \"golly isn't that cool,  I can actually highlight text!\"\n\nAnd guess what? That highlighting of text usually takes a few tries to get the text that you actually need to select with \"TAPS\" selected...to 'mark-up' a doc properly... and some compromise is usually entailed and could have been far more exactly... achieved with a mouse 30 seconds ago.\n\nLook ... do I like my iPad?\nYes!\n\nAnd I did  order a stylus for 27 bucks and it has not come yet so I can't comment upon that helpful addition as a partial solution for... the iPad's entry flaws... .  But realize... when one peals away the COOL... and gets to the functional daily needs of email ... and entry of certain data... you will spend a good deal of your iPad time... which after all... is life time... learning to get around.. the touch screen and the operating system\"s... limitations.\n\nNow ... it is true that if one has say...an iMac which I Highly recommend ... that the real question is: how much...do you actually  need to input at the coffee shop or as a quick reference in the car or as a very light travel basic communication computing device? If the answer is \"not really that much...\" or if putting up with the iPad's limitations for real text entry is OK on occasion... and the added weight of a keyboard is only needed part time... then it has indeed a LOT of very cool qualities and... apps too... that we actually do find we desired and... didn't even know it!!\nAre even... useful and yes... fun,  a LOT of fun.\n\nIf you work seriously on the road... an iPad is not for you... at this time in its development... if you need a very cool slick device that is indeed just about the perfect weight and size for extreme portability happiness... and mainly want it for consumption, of information... then the iPad is wonderful.\n\nThe iPad is a very creative and evolving technology. The \"Cloud\" Apple's and say Dropbox... are bringing all of these devices together and we all are literally with our use... defining their place and potential and the APP ecosystem is indeed VITAL... .\n\nThat participation in change... is in itself fun to watch and to take part in... lets face it... our participation in that creative process by supporting what works is... a central part of an iPad's attractions... nothing wrong with that! That is the old America, remember her?\n\nCreativity  is sadly... so purposefully dimmed for political outcomes... in our dear country...that any tree of creative life left...is worth supporting even one without a real keyboard... ."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "A year ago, nobody had an iPad. Then Apple sold 15 million of them in just nine months, creating a whole new category of technology product. The iPad may have become, in the words of Steve Jobs, \"the most successful consumer product ever launched.\"\n\nIt turns out that a lot of people saw the iPad's appeal: it's a supremely portable device that's well suited for checking your e-mail, surfing the Web, playing games, reading books and other stuff you get off the Internet, and even for getting work done. Kids and the elderly have embraced it.\n\nIt's awfully hard to follow such a massive success, but that's the task set out for Apple's new iPad 2, which goes on sale Friday. At least the iPad 2 has this going for it: the original model caught the technology industry so flat-footed that only now are true competitors beginning to appear.\n\nThose competitors will now face a new iteration of the iPad, one that's faster, smaller, and lighter than the model introduced a year ago--all while retaining the $499 entry price that has proven all but impossible for Apple's competitors to match. It's almost unfair.\n\nA game of inches (and ounces)\n\nCall it Jobs's Law if you like: The latest version of any Apple product is likely to be thinner and lighter than its predecessor. And so it is with the iPad 2. The size difference between the original iPad and the iPad 2 may seem slight, but that's only because we're dealing with such small products to begin with. But for products this small, every ounce and fraction of an inch counts.\n\nThe iPad 2 measures 7.31 by 9.5 by 0.34 inches, and weighs in at 1.33 pounds (in the case of the Wi-Fi-only version, that is--the AT&T and Verizon 3G versions are .01 and .02 pound heavier). That means Apple shaved .17 pound off the Wi-Fi version and .26 to .27 pound off the 3G version. The iPad 2 is also .16 inch narrower, .06 inch shorter, and .16 inch thinner than the original iPad.\n\nA matter of small degrees, to be sure, until you consider the percentage change: the iPad 2 is roughly two-thirds the thickness of the original iPad, and 88 percent of its weight (83 percent when comparing 3G models). Pick up an iPad 2 after handling an original iPad, and you'll notice the difference right away. This is a lighter, thinner device."}

With all other tablets, I noticed that the tablet would not react to the touch every once in a while.\n2. The tablet is for my wife. iOS is much more intuitive than Android when it comes to tablets. the complexity of use of Android is fine for techies, though.\n3. Assurance of OS upgrade.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "After playing around an iPad2 in the Apple store, I did a little research, made the leap and bought one.\n\nBefore I placed my order, I had a few questions about which one I should get: Black or white? Would 16gb be enough, or should I go for 64gb (since it's not like you can add memory to it later)? Or maybe I should take the moderate middle road and get 32gb? I had definitely decided on WiFi, not because 3G doesn't appeal, but because I don't need another monthly bill. What about the Apple-refurbished iPads? Are they as good as the new? Is there any tangible difference? If these are the same questions you have, I'll try to flesh out these answers in detail -- as well as what the iPad is good for -- and what it is decidedly not good for, and what a dedicated PC-user (like myself) should expect from a first-time Apple purchase.\n\nTHE SPECS:\n\nSo, Question #1: White or black? I was instantly enamored by the white. It was so... different. And that is the reason to go for white. Perhaps the only one. However, the reasons not to go for white outweigh this almost immediately: Primarily, the contrast of the white does in fact make the screen appear less bright and vibrant (I noted this in the Apple store) and there are reports of light-leakage. I went for black, and have no regrets.\n\nQuestion #2: What size? This was probably the question I spent the most time on, and I felt as if I couldn't get a really good answer for it. Some people seemed to find 16gb to be more than enough, while others said even 64gb wasn't enough. I almost bought the 16gb, but ended up compromising and getting a 32gb refurbished from Apple for the same price as the new 16gb. And I'm really glad I did, because I've already used more than the 14.4gb -- which is the usable space available one the 16gb.\n\nThe 16gb, I've discovered, would have been ideal for someone only using apps and browsing the internet. Forget using it for music or movie storage, it's just not happening. On my iPad I have about 80 apps currently, consuming 5.6gb of space. Contrast that with the 1300 songs I have on there which are taking up about 8gb of space, and you'll see what I mean about 16gb being an apps-only device. So, if you already have an iPod, say, then it might make sense to get the 16gb.\n\nThe 32gb is ideal for apps and storing a moderate music library, something I never would have anticipated using the iPad for -- but it turns out, I always have my iPad in my car, and find it much more convenient overall than my CDs. I've even gotten rid of an old stereo I used to play CDs on in the house. They're just kind of obsolete once you switch to storing tunes on an i-device.\n\nThe 64gb, I imagine would be perfect for storing a little of everything: Music, movies and apps. I'm actually glad I didn't go for the 64gb, as I'm perfectly happy with YouTube or streaming Netflix for a nominal monthly fee (more on this in a moment).\n\nQuestion #3: Is a refurbished iPad as good as a new one? Although I don't have a new one to compare, I'm going to say yes -- with one minor caveat. The refurbished iPads have new glass, a new back cover, a new battery, the same 1 year warranty, and go through the same rounds of testing that a new iPad goes through (if you buy from Apple directly, of course). And when you think about it, why wouldn't this be just as good as getting a new iPad? After all, even a new one could have flaws that might become apparent in the first year of ownership. There aren't guarantees with any device, and when you can knock 20% off the price and make a vote for recycling electronics -- better for the Earth -- why not do it, right? Oh, and the caveat? There are a couple of times I have come across some settings that were clearly from the previous user which is... a little odd. Nonetheless the pros outweigh this, so far as I'm concerned.\n\nAll, told, if I had it to buy over again, I'd make precisely the same choices as this time: Black, 32gb, wifi, refurbished. So, onto the device itself....\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________THE IPAD:\n\nThis is my first i-device, and I have always been a PC (Windows) user in the past, so it's an entirely new experience to me. I bought it primarily because when laptop shopping I ended up getting a fantastic deal on this behemoth of a wide screen laptop. Not portable at all... so what about when I'm at the coffee shop or the bookstore and I want to tinker around, check my mail, Facebook, etc. Here's where the idea of getting an iPad came in for me. I wanted an easy-to-carry, reasonably-sized, aesthetically pleasing (and here's where the competing devices were blown out of the water) device to fill my portable computing needs.\n\nInterestingly, some of the things I initially bought the iPad for are the same areas where the iPad falls short. I knew there would be no flash capability, and so expected this. In truth, it's not been much of an issue, and YouTube is way better on the YouTube-dedicated iPad program than it is on my flash-enabled Windows 7 laptop. But its the simple demands that are over-complicated by the iPad. Email is a bit tedious. Like the way that you can only delete one item at a time, see one folder at a time, can't do certain things like 'star' an email to make the level of importance or permanently relegate something to a junk mail category. Note: This refers to the included email program, but even if you do your email through Safari there's going to be a lot of awkward pinch-zooming to awkwardly replace the awkward lack of functions in Apple's email program. Similar issues arise with the Facebook app: It's hard to see who's online, for one thing. I can't share a story from someone else's wall to my own, and most infuriatingly -- if I post a comment, and hit enter too soon (easy to do with the on-screen keyboard layout-- backspace and send are way too close to one another) I can find no way of deleting it -- aside from opening Facebook in a browser window and trying to navigate the too-small text and awkward formatting, when this should be a an obvious and simple maneuver on the iPad app for Facebook. This is true of many apps that replace simple browsing, from eBay to Amazon to social networking. Most are beautiful, well-laid out, and missing at least one (often more) necessary function. And speaking of function, while zooming is a simple task, cutting and pasting is beyond annoying -- so much so that I often say 'hell with it' and don't bother copying things I otherwise would have. Apple needs to overhaul that function.\n\nIt is the aesthetic beauty of the iPad that rescues it from a lesser star rating based on the lack of functionality inherent in some its apps/programs. I tried the Kindle Fire in the store and found it to be visually lacking in comparison -- and much slower as well. Meanwhile, the iPad is lightening fast with just about any task you set forth to do. It makes my laptop with better specs look like a dinosaur in contrast. The screen is breathtakingly beautiful (and unless you're trying to close out lots of open apps, incredibly responsive). It's so fun to just look at that you will find yourself wanting to store a photo library on there just to view the pictures on it. I love having pictures of my kids to show off on here for the older relatives at family get-togethers. It's definitely better than a traditional photo album -- and that sentiment comes from someone who is rather old-fashioned about anti-technological items like physical photo albums. Side note: My 300 moderately-sized photos are only eating about .5g of space. Another side note: The camera, while not graphically amazing, takes some of the speediest photos I've encountered with a digital device.\n\nJust as the iPad is able to display unparalleled beauty with photos, its video display is equally amazing. Since I care little for large-screen televisions, watching movies on here has actually made me consider getting rid of our two televisions. Netflix is convenient, the resolution and sound are perfect, and although the selection for streaming is quite limited, it fills our equally limited television needs. I haven't watched a single show on the television since I received the iPad, but I have watched the entire first season of Downton Abbey -- at my own convenience -- which was quite a luxury.\n\nLastly, the apps that are built *specifically* for the iPad: The games (like Contre Jour, Angry Birds, Cut the Rope), Garage Band, and Drawing Pad are awesome toys to have on hand --and affordable (as well they should be, considering the cost of the device itself). There are endless free apps to play around with, download, play with a bit and often delete -- occasionally saving the really exceptional ones. This is a great bonus to owning the iPad. My husband has an iPod touch, and the apps are far more interesting on the iPad.\n\nThere are even a number of educational apps that I didn't expect. I'm not one for computing for kids in most instances, and we stay away from all that LeapFrog and VTech madness -- instead opting for books. But I've been so impressed with apps like Solar Walk and Star Walk that I've been willing to make an exception. They're magical, and present really difficult concepts like the universe in a understandable way.\n\nDespite the iPad having some glaring flaws, I would buy it again. I believe now -- as I did when I chose it -- that it is the best tablet available. I can't stress how much I love perfection of the display. I've been pleasantly surprised by the unexpected things which it has been so handy for. I'd have loved to have known about its flaws in advance, which is why I write this review -- I hope someone else will go into their purchase feeling more informed and confident about their decision than I felt when I ordered mine. But if I had it to do again, I am pleased to say I'd make the same decisions all over again, so it was an easy 4 stars."}

I suggest getting the biggest one you can so you don't have to worry about running out of space! I was worried about the white only after reading a few negative reviews about finding it distracting and I haven't found that to be the case for me. However, the screen protector I bought does not seem to fit as well as my mom's (same everything except hers is in black). I don't know if it was just a problem with that protector or if there is a slight size difference. Other than that no issues!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have wanted an iPad for a little over a year now, and I finally have one. I'm actually writing this review with it right now! A lot of people I know have criticized the iPad for being like the iPhone or iPod Touch, and I have to say while a lot of features are similar to my 3GS (don't own a touch), there are a lot of features which differ. I have had so much fun typing the screen of the iPad, I spent hours with the yahoo app talking to one of my friends while I installed my other apps. I am a college student and plan to use the iPad instead of my computer at school so I don't kill my back walking to class. I'm not the most tech savvy, but I know my way around the iPad from having my 3GS and love the simplicity of the device.  Besides, you can't beat the awesome of having almost full functionality of web pages through safari on the iPad. I continually get frustrated with my phone's version. I am not a fully converted Apple person since I still own a Sony Vaio and prefer the solidarity of The Sims 3 on PC. I also used a Mac last semester in school, and I just couldn't get used to it.\n\nI also REALLY love how much faster the iPad 2 is compared to the 3GS. It may not be a fair comparison but I also added 6 gigs if ram to my laptop so I could have a faster machine. I hate lag.\n\nOh! Not having adobe flash hasn't fazed me one bit. I don't really understand the argument about that one but the iPad has no trouble playing YouTube videos in safaris browser. It doesn't take you to the YouTube app like on the iPhone. I almost bought the Sony tablet which was recently released but I didn't feel like getting all my apps all over again since  I already own popular ones like angry birds. iTunes on the iPad has similar functionality to the program on the pc, and I'm assuming Mac, and I out most of the songs from my husbands accout in here. I also have never used a honey comb based tablet so iOS and iPad I went. iOS 5 installed in under 30 minutes for me.\n\nI have accidentally hit the back button in here twice with the iPad-the screen is extremely sensitive-and I don't think I can leave anything more useful for others considering the iPad, so I'll wrap it up. I got the 32 gig iPad in black and I've had a hard time putting it down. I'm also using a reflex series Otterbox and never plan on removing it from the iPad. I'm leaving a review for that next...but stop reading this! Get your iPad if you want one!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I had won an iPad 2 a few months ago by filling out a survey. Overall, i am very happy with the iPad 2. It is the 32GB model, so i have the extra storage. I have at least 70 apps and 3 songs and no videos on it and i only use up about 10GB so far. The ability to back up all of your documents, apps, music, etc. ti iCloud is a great feature. You get 5GB of free storage but then you can buy additional storage if you need it.\n\nEmail\nThe ability to check email on it is a great feature. I use the Xfinity Mobile App instead of the mail app though so the emails will delete and be marked as read on my computer too, not just my iPad.\n\nWeb\nThe ability to go on the web right from my iPad is also another great feature. If i need to look something up real quick i can just use the iPad instead of waiting for my computer to boot up.\n\nPrinting\nOne area that the iPad does need improvement in is the ability to print from it. We originally had a WiFi printer from Lexmark but did not have Airprint in it which is what you need to print from the iPad. So, i went to the store and bought a Kodak printer that says you can print from iPod, iPad, iPhone on it. I thought that that means that it has Airprint which is what you need to print from the iPad. Come to find out it doesn't have Airprint in it, BUT, you can download an app that lets you print from your iPad. So i get the printer all set up, connect it to my network, and try out the app. You need to save a screenshot of the screen you want to print from, the send it to the app which sends it to the printer, and it worked fine. Was just hoping i could use Airprint, but maybe next time.\n\nFlash Player\nI was a little dissapointed to find out that the iPad doesn't have a flash player built in. I can't open emails with videos in it or stuff on the web that requires flash player. I think apple should put built in flash player on the iPad, beacuse if they are going to compete against the Kindle Fire which has flash player, then they should seriously consider flash player. If you need a device that has a flash player, go with Kindle Fire."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "You are there, standing in the middle of the electronics department, credit card in hand, about to spend hundreds of dollars on a touch pad you can trust to be worth the money, and a good product. The store clerks are saying different things to you about each pad, and you don't know who to trust. Ladies and Gentlemen, the I Pad 2 is the correct item for you! It consists of app selection, optional WiFi, and other sources such as 4g. Coasting around the range of $800.00, I would suggest this particular system over any of the other available touch pads. I tried another once. I didn't like it. I would choose ipad2 over a regular i pad. why? many reasons.\n.It is faster\n.it looks better based on the fact that it is so thin.\n.Its the newest version, so why not take a go before it gets outdated?\nThe following are my views on this remarkable contraption. Also, I'm just going to call the I pad 2 an i pad just to make it easier. Just know that the I pad and I pad 2 are 2 different products. Sometimes, i will call it an i pad 2, but just so no one gets confused while reading this, there's a fact. Hope they help!\n\nFirst facts: This was a bummer, but based on Apple restrictions, the i pad 2 does not have flash, so it can't play online games or run certain programs that need flash. There is also no place for discs or flash drives, so you can't download saved work such as the data on flash drives or discs. You can't download programs like Microsoft office programs on this particular item, which is not fortunate, not to mention the fact that it doesn't connect to the printer. Hopefully some day it will evolve into better stats.\n\nCamera: For the most part i like the camera, but based on the fact i haven't seen or interacted with many other i pads except my own, which has a crooked, bury camera, it wasn't the best for me, but the other touch pad i owned had a horrible camera. I don't know how the other cameras look on the i pad 2 because i don't bother to put pictures of myself out into the public on the store tester i pads, so, keep the camera idea something to check on before buying. On the camera though you can make it look straigt ahead like a regular video camera or make it face the way you are looking at the screen, so it flips around depending on what kind of picture you want. I give MY experience on the camera a B grade\n\nApp selection: Great apps! Many apps are free, but 1 app's full version wasn't free on the i pad like it was on my other pad. I still don't think that should be a problem. Also the apps appear with fewer selections on the screen based on certain categories then my other touch pad, which appeared in a long list that was helpful. Although i would beleive that all together the ipad 2 has a wider selection of apps. Unlike some touch pads, The i pad 2 offers netflix, and many other apps that are one of the reasons i got the i pad in the first place. Great quality. I give the apps a A grade.\n\nBattery: The battery doesn't last very long. Sometimes, it last a long time, but for the most part, I always have it charging. This is a issue if i want to travel with it. I'm going to have to get a i pad car charger... Anyway, the battery issue may just be with only MY i pad 2 but I'm not really sure. I would give this category a C or B grade, but it has some work to do before it reaches an A.\n\nApp download speed: The apps for the most part download quickly, but there has been some times where the apps don't make any progress with loading so i usually have to delete it (and pray it will actually download) and download it again. In the end i always get ti worked out but its like, \"Come ON!\" you know? I give this category a A for it's amazing speed!\n\nWiFi quality: I love this category. Mine plays most H.D. videos and can just download apps from its app store rather then having to connect it to the computer to download things. That i can really appreciate. I can open up nearly all web-sights just the way they would appear on the internet unlike my last touch pad. I would say in order to get the full i pad 2 experience WiFi is a must-have. I give WiFi a A for great function!\n\nSpeakers: Lets put it this way, the speakers... they could use some work. Sometimes when i have it to the maximum sound it is hard to hear. That is not something that i favor based on the fact that the i pad is like, 40% sound, but i still like the product. If you have this problem i suggest going to a quieter area or plugging in ear phones to assure you get the most out of your money.\n\nCovers: I don't have a smart-cover. Perhaps the smart-covers do save the battery and make the screen sleep when you put the cover over it, but i have a cover that's not a smart-cover and it is just fine. As long as you turn it off when not in use for long periods of time any covers should work. Note that the cover should fit nicely around the i pad 2, that way, it is a better buy and protects the i pad more. i would suggest a case to help protect it and make a nice little stand for it. You can't exactly rate a cover because there are many different ones, but here is my rate on how important a cover is to have to me. A B. Its optional, but a good idea.\n\nApp Usage speed: Most of the apps i use are great, fast, functional, and don't have jerky movements. Take Talking Friends apps for example. They are fun, functional, and fast. Just how it should be, not to mention very clever. There isn't much to say about this particular category, but let me just say it deserves a A or B for nice function.\n\nNote where there should have been another Category view: I haven't had really any interaction with a regular i pad, so i can't say if the i pad 2 is really \"new and improved\", but i can say its good for me and very fast. Keep that in mind.\n\nVideo and Photo booth: I love making videos, so i was happy to hear that the i pad 2 came with a camera ready to make some videos! It is a personal highlight. Also photo booth is fun. seeing what your pictures look like in x-ray vision, and flipped, and so much more. I really liked that. too bad you can't film videos in photo booth :( Also note that both of these are the free apps that come right when you get the i pad. the video is connected to camera app.\n\nPersonal Favorites: I love the i pad 2, but my favorite features about it, are the following:\n.Its very thin and simple, which is very neat.\n.The apps are great and so are their function.\n.A i pad without WiFi is a very sad i pad.\n.Videos and photo booth.\n.speed!-------> ZOOM\n\nGRAND CLOSING..\nThese are all my opinions of different category in the i pad 2. Comment if there is more you want to know about the i pad 2 and i will see if i have an answer to add to this review for you. Thanks for reading! Hope it helped!!"}

My girlfriend just got me one for our anniversary. Funny thing is she just got one from her mom for Christmas at my suggestion. So now we both have one.\n\nShe just recently got wifi at work, too. She takes hers to work. She tends to call me about 3-4 times a day (at least it feels like that) and now she can call me on her iPad using Facetime, so she can see me as well. I don't really know how I feel about that feature sometimes, but it's pretty cool. I have other friends with iPads and iPhones and stuff, so we can all Facetime just like a house phone. It takes a little more effort to use it (just like Skype), but it's a really cool native app to the iPad. The camera quality is a bit to be desired. I think my Mac has a better camera than the iPad.\n\nAnyway, I'm not giving a review of Facetime. The iPad 2 is fast. The screen is pretty large compared to my iPod touch and my Droid X. It works well as a reader. The games work well on it. I've even used it as a drawing tablet a few times. I would link a photo I've drawn in my review, but I'm not sure I can do that.\n\nThe browser works just as well as it does on my Mac and my iPod touch. It's not the best thing in the world, but it works well.\n\nMail is still a problem for me. I can't get my Yahoo to work and I can't actually divulge why. I know the reason why and I'm not willing to fix it because it could be a slight security risk. Gmail works fine for me. I can't get my work e-mail to work either, but I haven't messed with it enough to really determine the reason just yet.\n\nThe iPads are great to have around to watch Netflix and things like that. Especially when there is a toddler that wants to watch something and everyone else is watching something on the big screen.\n\nFinally, the iPads are very expensive. So far my experience with Apple in the past few years is that they build a quality product and it tends to be worth it. I hope they continue this trend. I can't say whether or not it was worth the cost as I didn't shell out the money this time. I can only say that I'm enjoying the product and I'm very happy to have it."}

THese toys are great, but my fascination is not longterm.  Too soon after I spend my money on the latest \"must have\" the toy finds its way to the shelf as I move on.  I held off on purchasing an iPad2 because of the cost and because I was fearful it would spend $730 for something I would later stash away nver to use again.  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nI've had my iPad2 for about three months now and I love it more each day.  I'm using it everyday for several hours.  I use it for my work, and for fun.  I listen to music, watch movies, and play with fun, educational apps.  I have work-related apps.  I use it for my local government role so I do not need to print paper forms and other official documents.  I buy apps but I love the free ones.  It is a challenge to find useful apps for free.  I can manage my investments with it.  I can use Google Earth and travel the world.\n\nI no longer consider my iPad2 just a toy.  It is an intregal part of my life as I can quickly check emails and get headline news.  I can follow sports teams and have my music collection.  It is awkward to bring along during hikes, but I do have it in my car for the music.  I have podcasts and iBooks.

I work in a hospital and its great to be able to access electronic records/labs/orders quickly while doing rounds. Makes life a lot easier than finding a computer, logging on, then doing it. After work, I can use this if I'm out, sitting at home on the couch, showing off things to my friends, youtubing vids, facebook (stalking), and even watching movies.\n\nThe screen is beautiful, the weight is just right, and everything about it is so clean and perfect. I do wish the resolution could get a little higher as you can see a difference between it and the iphone4 screen, but i know thats something that will come in the ipad3. If you can wait, the ipad3 should be worth it as it will probably be the same price. If you can't wait, get this, you won't regret it!"}

Initial set up: The setup assistant worked painlessly and well only a few minutes after I took the iPad out of the box.\n\n2. Spent days trying to connect the device to my home WiFi network. Could not seem to get it to connect. Why? My son had given me the WRONG password to unlock the network. When he finally remembered the correct password, I was able to connect my iPad2 to our WiFi network in a New York minute.\n\n3. Not being a confident user of high tech, I was more than a little wary of setting up my mail on the iPad since it is always so easy just to access mail on my laptop and my Kindle Fire. I waited a few days before setting up the mail app. Silly me: I simply tapped to the Home page of the iPad2, then tapped on the Mail app, and then followed the setup steps on the screen. As we oldsters say, \"a piece of cake.\"\n\n I always used to refer to using Apple computers, etc., as intuitively obvious, but they are better than that. The steps are more than intuitive; instead, they are OBVIOUS."}

Ease of use is above and beyond any computing device I've ever had. Yes it's mostly a \"consumption device\", but that's about 90% of what I do at home. And for the other 10% (sending email, shopping, etc) the various apps work terrific. I barely use my laptop now, and I've ceased bringing it on vacations with me since my iPad can handle everything I would need to do on the road, and does it for longer.\n\nSome examples of how I've used it in the past few months:\n\n- Sold/traded in all of my programming reference manuals and bought ePub or Kindle versions of them all. My library went from a couple of hundred pounds of books to something that I can carry around with me at all times in my Timbuk2 bag.\n\n- Watched \"Prohibition\" Ken Burns mini-series on the plane to Key West with my girlfriend (that I easily transferred from my TiVo to my iPad). And while I was in the Keys I was able to browse online for activities and book day trips, find restaurants, etc. while tethered to my Android phone.\n\n- Played Scrabble / Words with Friends regularly with friends that live all over the country.\n\n- Read the news and check my email on it every morning.\n\n- Purchase/download all books I needed for grad school.\n\n- Used it for almost all of my Christmas shopping this year.\n\n- Introduced my family to my girlfriends family using Facetime.\n\n- Streamed music from iCloud/iTunes, SiriusXM and Pandora apps.\n\n- Used as a cookbook multiple times.\n\n- Watched movie on Netflix while plugged into the TV via HDMI in my hotel room on a business trip.\n\nEnough said... the fact that I've barely put the thing down since I've owned it is the best endorsement I can give. =)"}

So hooked the IPAD up, and waited for a full 24 hours. AFTER that, configured the machine to the wireless internet and then commenced to download EVERYTHING. The IPAD is COOL. It goes EVERYWHERE and can do practically everything. And the really weird part about this whole thing is this....my daughter, who is 4, put a claim on MY IPAD?????? Uhhh...NO. The answer is GET YOUR OWN. Too funny; For real, we share. But she did put a claim on the IPAD. All right, 5 stars, the seller gets a thumbs up as well for making sure that the delivery parcel was NON-DESCRIPT and no other verbiage was on the box either to state what was in inside either - once again the seller get a thumbs on that.

The uses are almost limitless. Best of all it is great for creating documents (writing novels), surfing the web, listening to music, and playing Apple games. In fact I only have one complaint about the lack of compatability with the Adobe Flash Player. Because of this it keeps you from playing a great many games including those on Facebook and other sites. Additionally certain videos at some sites will only play with the Adobe Flash Player. I hope in the interest of customer needs this will change in the future. Otherwise I am very satisfied with the iPad 2. I even got a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Rover-App-Controlled-Spy-Tank-with-Night-Vision/dp/B005OQYOB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rover App-Controlled Spy Tank with Night Vision</a>&nbsp;to remotely control with the iPad so my wife and I can watch the house and cats remotely. That brings some peace of mind, not to mention the Rover is a blast to play with.\n\nYou can purchase cases and accessories to attach your iPad to your cars headrest to allow others to watch movies while traveling. There are a plethora of accessories for the iPad 2 so you will have plenty to choose from for covers, cases, adaptors, keyboards, et cetera. There are numerous apps that you can download to make it great for work and/or play. The apps can be free or range up to about twenty dollars on average. Most those I got were free or around four to seven dollars. I use mine extinsively because I can carry it anywhere and I don't have to sit at a desk to work on projects or listen to music and play games. If you're a highly mobile person this is a must have tool/toy.\n\nI imagine most students want one to make their homework easier to work on at school or home. Because of the decent drive space and WiFi you can almost do anything that you could do on a full size workstation whether you use a PC or Mac. Since you can even buy cases with keyboards it can easily replace a laptop for a lot less money and portability. Small enough to carry in a daily planner or purse it wins hands down in portability. Since you can now back files up on the web and use webmail it alleviates the headaches of more complex and costly workstation choices. You will still require a workstation to interface with for printing, transferring some files, USB transfers, and certain other functions. But at least when you need portability you will have it.\n\nAddendum: Although I am slightly disappointed that the iPad 3 came out on the heals of my purchase, I can't complain really as mine was purchased more for functionality than graphics.  One reader asked me if the WiFi was an issue to set up.  I didn't have any trouble with it.  In fact it's far easier than setting it up on a PC.  Once you set it up it automatically goes out and looks for a connection and will ask you which server to connect.  The beauty of it is if you decide you don't want to pay a monthly fee is you can just disable it until you want to use that feature again.  Now that the price has dropped on them, unless you need high resolution for movies or graphics, I recommend you seriously consider the iPad 2.\n\nCA Luster"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Ok now Im not rich so I don't have a Xoom and a Touchpad and a Tab and everything else to compare it too, but I can give you my review of the iPad itself.\nI looked into all of the other tablets too and from what I have found, the iPad was the best. While it does not have flash, I have so far found that to be no big deal anyway. if you absolutely have to have flash for something, look it up on your computer.\n\nTyping:\nTyping on it is not terrible but its not my favorite. I had an iPod touch and was used to typing on a touch screen so that part wasn't a big deal to me. The touchscreen itself is great and is very accurate as to actually registering the button you hit. This review is written on my laptop though because I knew that I wouldnt want to type several paragraphs on the iPad. For chatting on facebook or searching the internet and stuff like that though, it is actually really great.\n\nCameras:\nNow the cameras are not 100% what I expected them to be. They are decent but are still grainy. Granted I haven't taken pictures and then viewed them in normal size yet, so the graininess is just being blown up to iPad size. It might get better if it is shrunken down but so far it seems grainy to me. Really though, its better than not having a camera at all.\n\nApps:\nPhotobooth seems to be the most fun app for showing off the iPad to other people. it was nice that it came with it instead of having to buy it. All of the other apps pretty much work like the iPod touch's apps do, and I love the iPod touch. The email is a lot nice to use now that it is updated.\nGarageband is great! for $5 its the cheapest and best audio recording software you can get. It was the first thing that I bought and have been playing with it ever since. I like that you can play the instruments right on the iPad and record and edit it all.\nSafari is a really great and simple browser and it feels really natural to search the web on it\niPod is really good too its like having your iTunes library on your computer and being able to go through all of your songs and have it all spread out where you can see it all\nI bought Legendary Blade II also for a few bucks and it really shows off how great the iPads graphics are\n\nScreen:\nLike I said above the graphics are really really good on it. My old iPod apps have all had to be updated because they are not even close to the quality that the iPad demands to look good. I think that the best way to see how good the graphics are is with books. the quality of writing is better than on my laptop.\nThe touchscreen interface is the best that I have seen on any of the gadgets ive played with. Apple has dominated the touchcreen market and I don't think anyone comes close to them.\n\nSmart Cover:\nI don't know what it will do over the long run but so far it is great! I didn't buy it from amazon so i don't know what the legitimacy of the seller is, but as for the smart cover itself, I love it. the auto on auto off works great and so does the auto align. It looks great on the iPad 2 and it adds practically no thickness whatsoever. I feel like it actually does protect the iPad and it does its job. when it is rolled up and used as a stand it feels sturdy in both positions. I couldn't be more happy with it. clearly it doesnt protect the back from scratches and stuff, but the back is solid aluminum. aside from a few scratches, its not going to hurt it. I don't plan to drop my iPad, but i feel like if i did drop it face down its strong and cushioned enough that it wouldnt destroy my screen either. I would definitely buy it again\n\nMemory:\nI got the 16 gig and it has more than enough for my 600 songs a 125 apps.\n\nI would totally recommend this to anyone and if anything changes I will update\nThat is all I have but if you found it helpful I would really appreciate you taking a few seconds to hit the helpful button :) Thanks"}

Well it will not print to our network that has an HP 4600dnt LaserJet printer, bummer. I have spent about 3 hours trying to figure out different apps to make it work. Fortunately he is not at this time a hard core tech, not even a small time one and might not really need to print anything, just play games. I have tried to figure out Air Print and it looks like it will only work with newer printers that have the program installed, so just be aware.\n\nLot of money and appears to be better, easier up start products on the market. I think some Apple people are just so use to apple products and just don't know there are other quality, products that operate the same that are maybe half to 3/4's of the cost. It took me an hour just to figure out how to get a desktop on the Ipad. I had to hook up the Ipad to my pc then go to a website to download, I have never had to do that with any other product that wasn't an Apple product.\n\nHopefully this helps someone that is on the fence with an Apple product.\n\nUpdate 12-26-2011.

Through gritted teeth whilst my friends enjoyed the cute novelty of the first release, I sweated out the wait for the version with the itty bitty webcameras and it was well worth the wait.  What is the point if you can't skype or facetime?\n\nAn iPad is simply handicapped without a webcam, well, Apple made up for it with a vengence by having TWO in version 2! One at the back one at the front to toggle between.  Making self-photography a breeze to compose and shoot with minimal error.  FaceTime, the apple version of skype now comes bundled to facilitate easy \"skype-ing\" between iPad owners (akin to free video calls on the back of a wifi network).  This is video networking made accessible to the masses.\n\nThis also becomes your camera and video camera for web publishing - the resolution though not the highest is laudable. And the pixel warehouse for your digital camera to download to when one is travelling.\n\nLike the iPhone, the iPad further usurps the position of the iPod relegating it further into the abyss of obsolescence - by incorporating a digital iPod inside for portable music & video storage and playback. It is not hard to allow one's life to revolve around this little tablet which makes it both a great productivity & recreational tool. Akin the hp's iPaq in 2004 except much more versatile graphically and with a much improved touchscreen.\n\nThe plethora of apps available at the Apple appStore is like a digital candy store (hundreds of thousands). So much to sample so much to buy.  Brilliant marketing to make it so cheaply available.  The volume drive works beautifully during this post GFC era where excesses are a little less rampant and frugality rules the day. 0.99 cents for a shot of adrenalin or seretonin secretion is not an unattractive proposition.\n\nGoodbye to clutter as subscriptions go digital.  And you get to carry your entire collection (of music, newspapers, magazines, books & photographs) with you wherever you go, all contained within less than 595g of hip and style.\n\nHowever security issues are not yet airtight hence I would hesitate to use this for personal banking or other such uses\n\nA Happy Camper =)\n\nps...musicians can now digitally purchase musicsheets and store, transport them in this compact little marvel - reducing clutter, making the entire repertoire portable and easily accompany you everywhere, to practice, to recitals, etc. The only downside perhaps is you get one page at a time instead of the usual 2 page spread."}

But as time went by and iOS5 was released I found my iPad 1 a bit lacking... Safari would often crash and more recent games such as Infinite Blade (the first one) wouldn't even load without crashing. It was becoming that I was getting a bit miffed with my iPad so I sold it off recently to wait for the iPad 3. Without an iPad in my life there was a bit of a void and I took advantage of one of the many resllers of the iPad 2 in the Marketplace. I found a great deal for a perfectly mint condition iPad and I have to say I am loving my iPad 2. No more crashing, the iPad 2 is really FAST and I feel it will be a bit more \"future proof\" for next year's iOS6 and even iOS7.\n\nThough it doesn't have the rumored retina display of the iPad 3 I feel that if you can get an iPad 2 for less than retail price right now it is well worth the purchase, even this close to the release of the next incarnation. Not to mention that a retina display for a device this large is less important than on an iPhone where the image size is much smaller. The only thing a Retina display will improve is the reading of ebooks and honestly not by that much. It's not as if it goes from illegible to crystal clear, just slightly more crisp... and for my needs not as necessary since I don't read much on my iPad to begin with. Also remember higher resolution also means more battery usage... so unless they put a bigger battery in the next iPad the battery life will be impacted. If they put a larger battery then the iPad 3 itself will be larger.\n\nWhich leads to another thing I love about the iPad 2, the size! It is insanely thin compared to the first iPad and quite a bit lighter in hand. Now my left arm will have less of a work out when I'm standing and working on the iPad. :P\n\nMirroring with an Apple TV is beyond fun and a great feature for those of you who want a HTPC but don't want to deal with the high prices of Mac Mini or a Windows HTPC. Now I can surf the web on my TV and stream (soon to be) any video found on the internet. As Apple declared Flash video is on the down swing and soon it'll bow out of the way to h. 264 as the go to streaming media format.\n\nThe iPad 3 will no doubt be great... and I'm sure I will upgrade to it too... NEXT winter.\n\nI paired my iPad with the perfect;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/KHOMO-DUAL-CASE-Grey-Polyurethane-Smart-Cover-FRONT-Hard-Rubberized-Poly-carbonate-BACK-Protector-for-Apple-iPad-2/dp/B005CI8836/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">KHOMO DUAL CASE: Grey Polyurethane Smart Cover FRONT + Hard Rubberized Poly-carbonate BACK Protector for Apple iPad 2</a>(I found one \"used-like new\" from Warehouse deals for $17.99)\nOriginally I had the Incase Magazine Case for my iPad which the Apple Smart Covers and this case mimics. Though there were features on the Magazine case that I will miss (3rd standing option that was between the vertical mode and the keyboard mode) this is by far the best looking feeling and quality full body protection that I have seen for any of the iPads. I loved the idea of the Smart Cover but hated the price and the fact there was no back protection. Also heard that the magnetic connectors end up scratching the iPad and falls off easily, this is not something I wanted.\n\nVery happy with my purchase and am glad I got myself this great Xmas gift."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Ma Hon got this for me as an early birthday gift, or maybe it was just a \"Welcome Home\" gift, kind of hard to distinguish now a days.\n\nIt being the 3rd Touch Apple Product that I am carrying, the IPhone 3GS and IPhone 4s (an other gift MA Hon Had for me when I got back this time).\n\nIn capacity, it may not be the top Model, but it serves my purpose greatly. As for connectivity, it is only WiFi, so it can have its limitations as far as access to online informations are concerned, but with the IPhones handy, it is kind of OK.\n\nWhat makes it different from the Iphones and the ITouch is primarily the display size, which on many occasions are far more feasible than the smaller units. There is just so many things that are much better on a bigger screen than it be on the smaller units, net browsing and entertainment, not to mention the Medical Programs that are available in the iTunes store. And that is an other plus for the unit, all being the same brand, they are all synchronized and maintained through a single account, which makes the control of context so much easier compared to having different brands units, organized with different environments and operating systems.\n\nAs for the connectivity issue, it being only WiFi, I have a HUB that allows me to connect 5 wifi units on one 3G network, and thou I must admit I have not used it that often yet, but it has it's benefits.\n\n12/26/2011: just had to add this small remark to my review. I have been in Dubai for the last 3 days, and with my this iPad, I have been able to keep in constant contact with my Hon, via SMS text and voice/video (via FaceTime) ... That being despite it is only a WiFi unit. I have to say, that is rather marvellous ....\n\nFor the unit, for maintain, a Screen protector is highly recommended. Given the fact that it is a touch screen, even if the protector gets scratched up, you can just replace that instead of having to replace the screen itself. Also, a hard case is recommended, in my case, MA Hon got me a book case, which fold and serves as a stand as well. As for a stylus, a Soft Rubber unit is the best, I have a belkin, but I am sure you be able to find some less expensive ones that serves the purpose just as well.\n\nI have had the unit for 10 days now, and have yet to explore MANY options available, but given the fact that I have been using the Apple's units for years now, it is all coming easy. But I can highly recommend it. Surely the Apple products are a bit pricy compared to some of the competing units, but for my needs, the compatibility and access that it offers with the other units that I possess, it is worth the couple of extra bucks. Not to mention the fact that the Apple units are some of the most beautiful and state of the art units that are available on the market, and the drawback of shortage of available softwares.... Well with the ITunes, that is a thing in the past.."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have been a hold out for several years now.  I would tell people \"I have an iPhone so why get just a bigger version?\"  My wife wanted to get an e-reader so I decided to put my money where my mouth was and buy a couple of iPads for us.  Hers would likely be a casual use device but I was going to try to use mine for business moving to a paperless work style (attempt #1,324 over the course of 12 years of different devices).\n\nInitial review was good... liked the device feel, weight, etc.  Clearly it looked nice.  I was offended at the cost of covers and accessories but I had somewhat gotten over that shock with the iPhone so it wasn't a new shock :) I felt that a lot of the app makers did a good job with their iPhone/iPad combined apps but it does suck to have to buy a separate app for those that don't have the combined versions.  But, overall a nice design and fun product to use.\n\nBut, there's a big but here, it's too fragile and no recourse from an accident.  Like many others before me I broke mine.  Total bone-head move on my part, not at all an Apple fault in my situation, but if you spend some time reviewing forums you'll see the advice I failed to read.  The device is incredibly fragile so even simple (aka not bone-headed) slips, drops, and bumps will leave you with a busted screen.  With no attractive means of recourse.  One would think that any product with a propensity for a major functional piece to break there would be a repair option.  Not the case with Apple.  Probably part of the business plan to be honest.  I tried to find out my options and costs (secretly hoping for a free replacement like others have touted) but two different stores told me 1) not repairable by anyone; 2) any signs or attempt at repair void warranty; and 3) only option is a \"courtesy\" replacement for $270 (16mb wifi version).  No option for repair internally at Apple, let alone an option more reasonable than spending another $300.  I checked and the local repair place quoted about $185 plus tax and the parts I found online looked to run about $150+.  For a glass screen!\n\nApple has a unique luxury in that they have a large client base that feels Apple can do no wrong.  An Apple \"genius\" could swing by the house at Thanksgiving and slap the loyalists grandmother and Apple would still be held up on a pedestal - the turkey was dry after-all.  So they don't bat an eye if iTunes misbehaves (the user shouldn't have tried to sync contacts), or if they try to connect with Outlook (the user shouldn't consider another product not made by Apple), or consider a good product would have given repair considerations to a critical yet fragile component.  The Apple flock is a great thing to have for a business.\n\nSo anyway, I would say the iPad is a great device.  It'd be better if the screen were more widget based like the android options, but it's snazzy, quick, and a joy to use.  But, leave it sitting alone on the desk and protect it with your life if you buy it.  Otherwise buy an android option for half the price and if you could bust it three times and still be less expensive than the Apple will arguably as good of performance."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "All I can say about the iPad 2 is that it is simply amazing. The faster 1 ghz dual core A5 processor is a workhorse. The display is very high quality and is very easy on the eyes. Watching movies and surfing the web over WiFi is a joy, especially compared to the iPhone 4 which I have and love, but the limited browsing capabilities of the iPhone is enough to make you want for something larger. For iPhone users, the interface is familiar and easy to adapt to, and for new users, it is easy to learn. The iPod and Videos features are nice to have when travelling, and for those who like to read, the iBooks app is a capable book reader and there are thousands of ePub books and PDF files out there to load up on. For people that use Office to write letters and school papers, there is the iLife office suite which is Office compatible in most cases.\n\nThere is a bonus for musicians. The iPad is becoming a professional tool for musicians with a plethora of music utilities, software synths (including a few Moog products), guitar amp simulators and even Garage Band to write and record on the go. The only thing is I wish it were more of an open platform and I wish it had stereo speakers, although most times I listen with earbuds.\n\nIf you are thinking of the Kindle Fire or an Android tablet, the only advice I can give is DON'T ... The iPad 2 is a great tablet, and is constantly growing to meet the needs of all different types of users."}

The weaker the signal on wi-fi, the slower the load but I guess that's to be expected. Dropping even one bar makes a huge difference.

Also, I do not own an Android tablet (yet). To avoid being labeled as a Fandroid, I will list what I liked about the iPad first (yes, there are things that Apple does well):\n\n- the hardware design is indeed well thought out: thin, light, and nice to look at\n- construction and quality appear to be top notch\n- the screen display is sharp and bright\n- iOS for all of its shortcoming runs very smoothly on this device\n- tons of apps in the App store\n- insane battery life -> This thing has the best battery life of any backlit display device I've ever used. It probably can go 4-5 days between chargings with average web usage.\n- instant on -> best thing about a tablet in general: instant web browsing\n- the perfect device for consuming media (Web browsing, videos, games) in bed\n\nNow, on to what I didn't like:\n\n- I have to use iTunes -> First thing that the tablet signaled for me to do was plug it in to the computer and install iTunes\n- no back button\n- Safari sucks -> First thing I downloaded from the app store was Dolphin HD\n- no expandable storage (well known)\n- no Flash -> sure Adobe has decided to stop supporting this for mobile devices, but for the moment there are still plenty of sites which use it. I was surprised by how many sites to which I can't view content. For a device which purports to be great at Web browsing, this kinda sucks.\n- limited customization of iOS - it's a tray of icons and that's it. Barely can be called an OS.\n\nAlthough I hate that the iPad doesn't have expandable storage, USB ports, etc, that is the Apple way. It always has been. The Apple ecosystem is very closed and restrictive. I am positive the iPad 3 won't have any USB ports on it either. However, the main reasons why I'm only giving this device 4 stars are: iTunes, iOS and the lack of Flash. For the amount people pay for this thing, you should be able to access 100% of the sites out there. All this being said, and it pains me to say it, Apple still has no equal in producing a sexy piece of high quality hardware. Disregarding specs (i.e. processor speed, RAM) the iPad 2 is still the benchmark hardware for tablets. Just think if this thing had flash, a USB port and you didn't need iTunes to access it from your computer. Now that would be something.\n\nOne additional comment on tablet devices in general. Nobody NEEDS one of these things. They are, in my opinion, the ultimate in media consumption (videos, e-books, games, browsing, social networking) which is the opposite of productivity. Seriously, the main reason I wanted one was so I didn't have to wait the 120 seconds it takes to boot up my laptop to browse the Web. And also so I could browse literally anywhere in my house. Definitely, these are wants and not needs. Just a thought."}

But with the newly redesigned exterior, upgraded hardware, and my wife desperately wanting one more than I did, I finally ended up getting one.  So far we are tremendously satisfy and uses it more often than we ever thought we would.\n\nThe new iPad 2 is slimmer, sleeker, faster, and lighter than it's predecessor while retaining the same display size.  Upgraded with a faster processor, it runs a lot smoother and able to multitask more quickly without getting overheated or apps crashing.  The traditional aluminum back casing makes its return with a sexy sleek taper design.  I always feel the sense of durability and toughness, just an overall very solid constructed piece of work whenever I'm handling it, even when dropped, multiple times.  Both higher megapixel cameras front and back allowing better quality photos, video, and greater facetime moments with family and friends.

Personally, I've had a couple laptops expire on me due to overheating. You always have to keep them on a firm surface so you don't block the vents. The iPad doesn't have these problems. You no longer have to grab a tray or giant book to set your laptop on when using it in bed.\nVideo Skype works great on this tablet - the cameras make showing people things FAR simpler due to the front and back placement.\nThe battery life is excellent! This thing can go for two days without a recharge! And that's with fairly heavy usage (try that with a laptop!)\nThe touchscreen is extremely responsive, the machine is very fast - wifi works extremely well.\nThe only issue I have is the reflective screen - I am not a fan of the reflective screen and have ordered a matte screen protector - not because I feel it needs protecting, but because I want to be able to read in various lighting conditions."}

It was absolutely amazing for about the first hour that I used it.  However, once the novelty of it has worn off it isn't extremely useful.  I was only able to find two of my textbooks available as an ebook so I only saved about $50.  Taking into consideration that I paid $600 for it, I most likely will not be able to save any money like I was initially hoping.  Though the Ipad is a fun toy to have around, the apps for it are pretty fun, and it has internet browsing capabilities, it only has about 80% of the utility of using a computer.  For this reason I find myself never really using it for anything and I plan to sell mine before next semester."}

I've owned many PCs and one laptop during that time and never even considered getting anything other than Windows. When I got a phone I made sure it ran Android. I was anti-Apple. I thought people who bought Apple products were members of a cult who'd been brainwashed.\n\nHmm. I got an iPad after my partner said she wanted one. I was seduced the second I held it. Wow. Unbelievable. It took minutes to set up. There were no error messages. Everything worked perfectly. The design is elegant, sublime.\n\nI never thought I'd own a tablet let alone an Apple product, but I can honestly say this was one of the smartest, coolest purchases I've ever made. The apps are great, the battery holds a charge, and it's an incredibly freaking fun toy.\n\nI was wrong. All you Apple people were right.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I haven't used any tablets other than Apples' product. Original iPad was my first one, which was bought as a gift for my friend and accidentally became a good entertainment for me and my wife. It's a great product, one of a very few gadgets I find myself truly love to use and feel the convenience and ease of use that rarely comes with a product that is sophisticated in its functionality and simple in its design. The reason I talk about my iPad in a iPad 2 review is that I want to give you a perspective of how I loved my iPad and all the good things about iPad has been improved and perfected, either in a subtle or substantive way, in iPad 2. The most obvious change I sensed were two things, a significant reduce in weight and a increase in processing speed. I have frequently found myself looking for iPad 2 at home to have a google search job done even though iPad is up front of my eyes.\n\nAnother thing I came to appreciate both iPad and iPad 2 is their intuitive user interface. Quite opposite to a technology geek as I am, my mom has no knowledge in what an operating system is and has no idea how her order is fulfilled by a computing device, be it a pc or whatever else. This makes it very hard to explain to her how she should interact with the interface of an operating system. To her, opening up an application on a Windows desktop, in the start menu and Notification area are fundamentally different actions that take conceptually distinctive approaches to accomplish. Such understanding and confusion in opening different application have soon disappeared after only a few practices with the iPad home button. And now she is happily occupied herself with the Bakery Story app on a device easiest ever to use."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I bought the white 16GB ipad during the black friday deals on the apple page, for around 450 plus tax, so hardly cheaper than on Amazon now.\n\nI did buy this for my parents, based on reviews. All reviews agree on the following: 1) the ipad is still the best tablet around and 2) it is the easiest to use. Well, both statements are wrong. Since so much has been said already on the ipad let me get straight to the issues:\n\n- Being an android user (phone-wise) I got so used to the back button. On the ipad there is no such thing. If you push home, you get straight to home screen. If you want to go back one stap within an app, touch the screen and search and search for \"back\" on the screen. It is very inefficient. Also when installing multiple apps from the market you have to go back and forth several times.\n\n- The screen resolution is too low. Webpages do not look as good as on other tablets. While 4:3 format makes some sense, given that you use it also in portrait, the low resolution looks just outdated. Ok, I knew that before, but I did not expect it to be as disturbing.\n\n- Google. Apple fights its war with google to the disadvantage of consumers. No Picasa integration! Seriously, this is just poitics! They want to take control over you, so you are not supposed to use google sevices. You will also miss other google apps if you know android.\n\n- No official google talk! Say goodbye to you android using friends.\n\n- Amazon. They had to circumvent Apples policy using a web app for their services. Just because they want to force you into itunes. Once you are in itunes, you are forced into buying apple products forever. Why give up the freedom of choice? Lets say apple products were getting worse and in 5 years all your money is in itunes items. Do you want that? Hell, no. If you buy music with Amazon you remain independent of the hardware provider at least. The ipad is a mere retail channel (like the kindle fire, only more expensive). It does not give you freedom like galaxy tab.\n\n- USB. No real port. Ok, buy the adapter. 30 bucks. Find out it serves only 20mah. So it is not USB, as it is not following the standard which 100. It is disfunctional! You need workarounds.\n\n- The whole device is about workarounds. Apps. Paid apps! Apple earns on programms that give you DLNA, THE STANDARD to stream movies to your tv. Or they earn on making you buy the apple tv box. But Apple just ignores and established standard.\n\n- Antitrust, where are you? Microsoft would have been sued to death for what apple is doing here!!!\n\n- File access. Forget it. This is again about workarounds. Dropbox etc. Well, but I wanted this for my parents. Supposed to be easy, but IT IS NOT. It is f difficult to find all the f workarounds. To start actually working with this.\n\nConclusion. Decent pad to surf with nonflash browser. Bound to apple channels for buying digital stuff, basically a retail access you are paying for. Imagine paying your supermarket just for being there. Everything else is disfunctional, not following standards, locking you in, making you search for workarounds and thereby stealing your time. It is NOT EASY to use, compared with android.\n\nGet something else. Not the ipad."}

There is no lag at all in moving across apps.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "What makes Apple a great company is the amount of polish they put on their finished devices that ensure they work and work well. Bugs and other device problems aren't something you come to expect from Apple because of the tireless work that goes into making sure the manufactured parts work together in harmony. This was something manufacturers of other tablets did not do when they rushed their way to the market Apple was claiming all to itself. The result was a number of products, most of which had bugs or other serious performance problems.\n\nAnyway, the iPad 2 bulked up a bit from its predecessor. A dual core processor and a little more RAM helped keep this device up with the Johnsons, spec-wise. Usability-wise, it's still as friendly to the user as can be. The interface isn't complicated and anyone familiar with how an iPhone works will have no problem getting into this device right away.\n\nCameras on front and back were added. It's a shame they couldn't get a HD camera sensor in the device because that would make Facetime all the better. As it is, the video quality isn't that great but it does what it says it does and the video chat function works pretty nice. The back camera? Never used it and don't plan to.\n\nThen there is the App Store itself. Instead of paying $69.99 every time you need to feed your kid's hunger for a new game, you can drop 99 cents for most applications, whether they are games or educational apps or any of the vast amount of programs created that fit anyone's budget. As tablets become more and more popular, more and more content is finding its way onto the device. ABC has a player where you can watch their new shows in their entirety. HBO has one, too. Doctors are using these devices as they make patient records easily available. Teachers use these to track grades for their classes and educational apps help them figure out what subject matter their students may be struggling with. And these are just two niche examples of what the device can do. As an everyday consumer, you can really shape this device around your life and even find applications that make your professional life easier.\n\nFor a portable, in your bed experience, this works wonders. The backlight trims when it detects low lighting so your eyes won't strain. The 10 inch screen is more than enough for watching Netflix or other content you can stream (I use AirVideo since I have a lot of media on my home machine and it streams it all -- .AVI, .MKV, .MP4 -- perfectly).\n\nIf you take this wifi model out of the house and find yourself in places where you don't have wifi access, you can still use whatever apps you have that don't require an Internet connection, or you can play videos that you store on the device. Since this is Apple we're talking about, you can find apps that will play any kind of media so you aren't stuck with just the .MP4 codec that Apple would prefer you use.\n\nThere aren't many limitations to the device...Adobe Flash support is usually cited among the things people don't like about the device. Good news on that front: Adobe is abandoning Flash for mobile devices (in part because they can't fix the non-stop security holes Flash has) so eventually that won't be a concern. Steve Jobs said Adobe Flash was garbage and didn't get support for it with the iPad. Other manufacturers chose to include Flash but it didn't take long before they admitted it killed the battery life on their devices, while the iPad2 can go all day without needing a charge. Watch movies all day. Play games all day. You don't need this hooked up to a power outlet all the time like you would a laptop and this is much easier to carry around, so the number of situations you can use this device (waiting rooms, long car trips, air travel) goes way up.\n\nThere are many things to like about this device and there are some drawbacks (no USB support besides tethering to your computer, no HDMI, no Adobe Flash and no expanded memory card slots. But they are few and nearly insignificant when you realize there are alternatives to the roadblocks you think you may face, including cloud storage.\n\nThis tablet is the cream of the crop. There is some good competition out there but the ease-of-use, availability of 70,000 plus apps in the Apple app store, plus how dependable the device is keeps Apple on the throne of best tablet manufacturer."}

The only trouble I had was with iTunes and trying to get my music transferred over but I think that's me and not the iPad. So far, I'm loving it but I've only had it for a few days. Would have given it 5 stars but it cost $20 more than if I had bought it at the store. Pay the price for convenience I guess."}

Checked the info in the search engines, and it turned out i was not alone, totally disappointed because i was never informed about that.\nCalled Apple which confirmed the same but said they did not have to disclose this info before purchase, and that \" I should have asked if it charged in the computer \"!!!. I could understand asking for OS specifications, software, etc, but not if the darn thing was charging in the computer, like my other Apple devices and Blackberry, including the Playbook that charges fine.\n\nI travel a lot internationally, and i rely on the seat charger port to charge my tablet. After all, the Ipad 2 is a portable device. So I asked them to at least recognize the flaw and to send me the adpters for foreign countries i visit constantly. The answer was from the supervisor : \" NO way. You can purchase the adaptors for $81.00 or get a refund \", and a refund i sure got by sending back that device.\n\nWith this type of attitude of superiority, and the tragic loss of their genius, I don't give more than 5 years for Apple to face the music. What a shame. Apple thinks it is a top Fashion Haute Couture House \" by appointment only \".\n\nI'll keep using my Playbook and will get the Samsung Android as a back up, but will keeo using the Ipod!!!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I thought about getting a tablet a hundred and seventy  eight times before finally buying one. I have a couple of laptops and a mac desktop so I wondered if I really need one. I know it isn't that expensive to own but then I also had 2 iPod Touches. So basically I was going to get the iPad 1 first but then they came out with the iPad 2, I waited several months and then like any man who hates indecision I decided to get a tablet. The choice was simple. I was used to the iPod Touch (4th generation) and thought this would possibly be similar. I was worried it would sit in one corner of my house. To clarify I never needed an iPad, what I did like however the most was the speaker on it. You see, i'm big on music and wanted something that can behave like a traveling jukebox. Besides watching a film when I'm on an airplane  won't be a bad idea either. I was sincerely considering getting the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 but then I knew this thing has been the best selling product of all time so I decided to get it anyway. I've had it for a little over a month now and in the following points i shall speak of the features, some unique and share my findings with you.\n\nUNIQUE FEATURES OF THE IPAD 2 -\n\n1. At 9.7 inches of diagonal length and brightness that is nothing short of being called exquisite one would imagine this thing to have an average battery or a good battery but the battery life is extraordinary. I use my iPad for a couple of hours daily and I must say that despite music playback, wireless data transferring to the iPad from my mac iTunes library, this thing lasts me for at least 5 days. This is remarkable. I can give you the best device in the world as a manufacturer but if the battery life isn't good what good is it to keep charging it. It does take a very long time to charge mind you which tells you that it's gonna last you a while. For some bizarre reason I like to charge this with my Mac. Charging using the wall outlet is slowly getting primitive.\n\n2. The speaker is amazing, it's loud and clear but you have to know where the speakers are placed and it's very important or else it will hamper your experience. Sometimes you have to hold it in your hands to make sure the sound output is ideal. Does it work well placing it on  a flat surface glass or  wood? Yes. What do I use the speaker for? iPod. At 16GB this is just about enough for me to carry a contemporary selection of music  and films with me. Does it sound good while browsing internet pages? Yes. Youtube is exhilarating to say the least. Also only selected Facebook videos will work because many are not available on mobile devices so if something doesn't run on your iPhone or android phone, it may not run on the iPad. Fair trade.\n\n3. There are two cameras, both are sub par for 2011 but if you're sitting in a dimly lit room and have washed your face, it may just somehow take a nice photo of you but I seldom take pictures from it. I like to record 30 second to 1 minute videos and email it directly to people. I always keep it connected with my wifi. This is really convenient and is a NEW WAY for me to keep in touch. I never did this with my mac or my iPhone. Also please note an interesting thing here, if your video is too long, your iPad tells you that you cannot send it owing to the large size. I have not gotten into the whole editing video and cutting it thing so what I then resort to is UPLOADING  IT DIRECTLY ON YOUTUBE. Great feature though quality is to be compromised slightly.\n\n4. The iPad 2 weighs less than the iPad 1 by a significant amount. This shall be reason enough for people to upgrade or maybe you guys can wait for the iPad 3 to come out in April next year (random estimate)\n\n5. While typing on the iPad is a breeze for \"novices\" and \"intermediates\" it is not ideal for a super fast expert typer. Having said that I don't use it much for typing. I am much faster on my phone than I am on the iPad. I have noticed i am able to type best when I am not holding the tablet in my hands and it is resting on a surface. Now I have installed a invisible shield for it because it liked to keep a daily account of fingerprints. Did I find an ideal one? No. I also use an invisible PLASTIGLASS thing for the back which I found on Amazon and found super amazing. The back is so smooth even with this accessory. I find the leather cases a little too pricey and there are several available but I find them kind of obstructing to the design of this iPad and a little cheap so I don't use.\n\n6. Great company on an airplane - While I am always fidgeting with this device when it's playing something, the device makes for great company on an airplane provided you have an \"mp4\" type file to play back on it. You can easily install it using iTunes. But if you have  an avi file or a divx file I don't know how to play them or transfer them. The iPad doesn't work as a USB STORAGE device so it won't show up on your finder (or my computer) when connected. There is no way for a user to save files by dragging and dropping. WHILE MANY ARGUE over the relevance of such storage, I believe the absence of it helps in keeping things organized and we all could do with a little less clutter. iTunes works beautifully for transferring stuff. I have noticed on all apple platforms (iPhone, iPod, iPad) that uploading a picture to Facebook involves more steps than on Android. Infact in certain cases Apple makes you buy an application to upload files to Facebook for the iPad. I find this cheek quite amusing but I take it with a pinch of humor. While playing back video you can tilt the device in any which way you want and the screen tilts that way. The video output is superior and the tilt  helps so it makes sure your fingers don't keep smacking into the headset jack when headphones are attached.\n\n7. Browsing - Yahoo looks utterly brilliant on the iPad. I love to go  once a day and simply look at their news features. Most search engines have specific websites for the tablets to access em and it looks super. My friend has a Xoom and he loves his tablet and is always talking about it but I see a sincere longing in him for an Apple iPad. The interface is unmatchable whether you are browsing, playing back a video or a song, the iPad wins. I do not use this as a task keeper so I don't bother with office utilities and all. Neither do I edit videos on the iPad but I believe there are inexpensive  solutions available. I read about them all the time on Macworld. Browsing on the internet, watching youtube videos, being on Facebook - it all seems flawless on the iPad. Much better than using a computer or an iPod or a phone. This is where the iPad truly shines. The font and the brightness I repeat is flawless and magical - nothing like i have seen in a dozen years of computers.\n\n8. TRANSFER - With the new ios 5.00  and iCloud I can actually send music, video, pictures to the iPad or play them back on my mac without connecting. Another big significant improvement. Now if only I could charge it wirelessly :)\n\n9. Are you thinking about getting the 32gb version? Don't. The 16gb is just fine  - for applications you won't need more. Multi-tasking is very easy and truly mastered on the iPad as opposed to the relevance on an iPod or iPhone courtesy of the big screen. Yes there is no flash support so I can't watch imdb trailers directly on the iPad. I have found applications which allow me to download music directly for free on the iPad - I am sure you will too. Netflix works flawlessly on this. I have put 740 songs on it and three films and have 35 applications installed but I still have 3GB remaining. After watching this film once I delete it to keep it free for another. This way you won't need a bigger iPad but if you do the difference is just $100 + Tax. I have also found that there exist many solutions for iPad users to wirelessly connect the iPad with a wireless storage hard drive. The expansion options are super. So take a look into that but I strongly advise getting just the basic  16gb version. I have a 64 gb iPhone and 64gb iPod so maybe I am so adamant on the uselessness of a higher storage iPad too.\n\n10. Miscallenous - It works with bluetooth, the iPad is light, unique for browsing, unique for youtube, ultra fast, multitasking is beautiful, you can play music or pandora while browsing, you can also switch the screen off and it will continue singing to you for several hours, the battery life does justice to it's perfections, the cameras are ok, i never Skype using it or i don't use FaceTime cause I don't know many people who do that. I like to carry it in my 13inch laptop case logic bag when I have to. I haven't dropped much water on it because i like it too much to be clumsy  with it. No headphones or instruction manual is  shipped. It took me roughly 30 minutes to set it up by connecting  with my mac.  It comes with a decent amount of charge so you can go 4 hours of playing around with it right out the box.\n\nI want you to look at all the above mentioned points and ask yourself if this is a notebook replacement? Obviously not. Because it has no physical keyboard, hdmi out, usb slot but if you are a casual browser, you can invest in this first and use it within the first 30 days to make your mind up. Apple is good that way. Overall - this is by far the best device i have ever used. It beats my iPod, iPhone, android phone, old blackberry, my mac desktop (close  2nd) , my ASUS laptop, my tv, my xbox, my blu ray player, my cameras and even my iron. Good luck. Don't buy the white one, get the black one."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "If you still on the fence on what tablet to purchase, play it safe and buy an Ipad 2.  The experience is much more enjoyable over all.  This is a non-biased review, I own a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 as well (I may even be more of a fanboy toward Samsung, owning a 3d Blu ray player, 3D Led and LCD tv).  In my opinion, what makes the Ipad better than any of the Android tablets is the apps.  Apples app store has more apps than the Android market has to offer.  The Apple app store is also better looking and more organized (Android is getting better though).  Everything is clearly labeled for what device ie Ipad or Iphone/Itouch.  On the Android market its hard to tell whats what.  I have downloaded many apps that are intended for a phone.  I downloaded Guitar Hero 5 from the Android market and playing it was unbearable due to the tiny screen size, there was no option to enlarge the screen (Android needs to do a software update for this asap).  If you have a favorite Itouch game that you wanted to play on a bigger screen you can with the Ipad, you can increase the screen size).  In my opinion developers of apps are clearly making them first on Ipad.  For example, Netflix, Face Book, Onlive, and Boxee.  I would love to have a offical Face Book app for my Galaxy Tab. There is a Face Book app for Android but its ment for a phone and looks terrible on a tablet.  Why does it take so long for android to get them?  Even similar apps for both apple and android look better on Ipad, words with friends and Amazon Shopping app for starters!  Amazon you NEED to give Android the same app you gave Apple!  The one on my GT sucks.  Apple even has more demos of games...there usually called something like lite or free.  Apple has airplay which is cool if you own a AppleTV, I can play Angry Birds on my Samsung 3D LED 55 inch TV!  Yes Samsung has AllShare (Samsungs version of AirPlay) but for some stupid reason the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 doesnt have that app!  Why in the world does the first generation have it but the new one doesnt?  You cant even download it off the Samsung App store, maybe its coming w/Ice Cream Sandwich??  Heres basically my pros and cons for the Ipad:\n\nPros\nEasy to use\nTons of Apps and better looking ones\nAirplay\nWay more accessaries and Cases (Im still waiting for a OtterBox case for my GT)\n\nCons\nNo flash\nVery controlled device and you cant customize it like Android\n\nHeres a couple of things that I like better on the Galaxy tab.  On paper the GTs specs are better than Ipad 2.  You can customize it just about any way you want...but you need to be a lil tech savy.  Just about every game on Android is free and and they are full games (with ads)  Everyday Amazon gives you a free app!\nThere is more than one market place to shop from (Android Market, Amazon, Samsung etc.)  Youtube looks cooler on Android...love the 3d honey comb looks!"}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "This is perhaps the biggest \"trendy\" waste of time and money yet. I, like a lot of other sheep, went out and quickly spent about $650 on this thing. Then I was told by Apple,for an additional $150 I could get two years worth of technical support which I gladly gave up. What they did not tell me was that I would have to be on a complete LEARNING CURVE( which they did not even understand themselves!) to use this product. First, let me say, don't waste your money on any Apple technical support gimmicks. I had some valuable notes stored on my Ipad 2 to do a convention with about three days before this happened. I went to Apple technical support because my e-mail did not work on my Ipad 2. Then they instructed me on how to delete my notes and \"wake up my e-mail\". I said, \"won't I lose all my notes?\" She said \"No, one has nothing to do with the other\". My response was \"Are you sure? I really need these notes for my speaking engagement at the convention\". She said \"No way you'll lose anything. Trust me\". What she should have said is: \"I'm an Apple tech support person, who gets paid by the hour, and it's no skin off my nose if you lose your notes or not!\". And that's exactly what happened. As per her instruction....I lost all of them. I was devastated. I had to spend days,scrambling to recovering at lease some of my lost notes. I will never get back what I lost...ever. I didn't know that everything on an Ipad 2 had had to be backed up to a REAL COMPUTER(notice I said: REAL COMPUTER). I was never told this. Now, that there have been so many failures and complaints about this product I understand they've created a thing called \"cloud\", which does the same thing....backs up your files. You will do better to buy a smaller version of a laptop and don't fall for the nonsense,like I did, that this is a great buy.....because it's not.\nWondering if my e-mail was ever fixed? After spending six hours on the phone with Apple and completely losing my notes and going through the process to \"restart\" my e-mail 6 times..... guess what? It still doesn't work!!! If Apple tech support is the standard for which other companies should model themselves,then we have NO STANDARD. I feel very ripped off."}

The iPad camera's resolution is not great when zooming way in on a subject, but I didn't really expect the iPad to replace a good quality hand-held digital camera anyway. It works well with Wi-Fi; haven't yet had a need to sign up for the optional Verizon service. Overall, it's been a good purchase."}

Nonetheless, ever since I got the iPad, I have been using it for a range of tasks, focusing mainly on reading magazines and books. I travel often, and the iPad allows have everything I might want to read on a trip in one, which also happens to be lighter and more compact than most books out there. The only drawback is that typing on this machine is slow since you have to keep an eye on the keyboard at all times, but this holds true for all other tablets, and its easily fixed by purchasing an external keyboard if typing is essential to you. A must have accessory for this item is some sort of protective case. I have two, apple's sponsored screen protector (which conveniently locks the ipad when shut), and a sleeve for traveling, so that I can easily put it in my backpack when traveling."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Let me start out by saying, I am neither a Apple Fanboy, nor a pro-Windows person.  I have a Windows phone paired with a Mac computer.  So, I generally buy products based on the product rather than the company. At first, I was completely against getting an iPad, since I figured that my Mac could do anything that my phone couldn't. I broke down my favorite aspects and least favorite aspects of the iPad 2 (not software, but hardware):\nFavorites:\n1) The weight distribution of the tablet: It doesn't seem to be too heavy, or too light (as in cheap).\n2) Materials: I was leaning more toward a Android tablet, but the materials that went into those felt so cheap to me. The iPad 2 has a great aluminum feel to the back, with a glossy front.  I miss the Gorilla Glass of my Samsung phones though, since I never needed a screen protector.\n3) Everything just works:  If you have ever had an Android phone, you understand what I mean. Occasionally, the Android OS just freezes, or crashes (at least on my previous phone).  When you press the home button, there is no lag.  This has more to do with the software of the iPad (iOS 5). True, it is more of a restricted OS than the Android OS, but its a sacrifice I was willing to make.\n4) The prestige that comes with an iPad:  This may sound shallow, but I didn't not want to have to defend my position of getting an Android tablet over an iPad.  This holds its value long into the future, verses lesser known Android tablets.\n5) Clean lines:  A minimalistic design.  Clean cut, very stylish.\n\nLeast Favorite:\n1) True, the iPad is very balanced, but it does get heavy when reading after awhile.  If you are looking for an ereader and won't be going into the features of the iPad, then don't buy it.  Buy the Kindle Fire or another device.\n2) Every accessory seems to be (excluding a few of course) very expensive.  If you want a good deal, you have to be willing to hunt for awhile, buy used, or pony up the extra money to buy the protective case, or screen protector, etc.\n3) I still feel nervous carrying it around with me. Its a double edge sword... yes, I love the prestige that comes with the ipad, but so do the thieves.\n\nOverall, this review isn't going to make someone who doesn't want one, buy an iPad.  What I must say is: if you have never used an iPad, don't hate on iPad owners.  After using this for awhile, I can't understand my hesitation at first to buy one, or why I waited so long.\nAdvice: rumors are swirling about the next iPad (claims to be iPad 3). Do your research on the rumors or wait, so that you can buy the most up to date out there."}

Not only did Apple lose my backup during the update (causing me to restore the whole \"system\" from scratch), but now it runs EVEN SLOWER than the last iOS 4 update.\n\n  Hasn't anyone else noticed this?\n\nWhen I updated it to iOS 5, I said to myself, \"If iOS 5 runs even slower or causes any other problems, I'm going to throw this thing out the window. Well, not going to do this, but I'm REALLY going to recommend AGAINST the iPAD to anyone interested in getting one. Can't take iPad or iPod seriously--even for music since I'm still trying to fit all the music I had on the iPad before which I can't fit now, after restore. And I can't put music on my iPad OR iPod Touch which resides on an external flash drive, which iTunes CAN play, but my iPad and iPod Touch cannot.  And iTunes syncing is all screwed up. Choose the wrong option and IT WILL DELETE all your music, apps, photos, etc.  NOT like it used to BE.  ;...(\n\nAND...I hate touch screens. Ironically, you CAN'T touch them. (As MC Hammer once sung, \"Can't touch this.\") Any slight brush with a stray finger makes it do something you don't want it to do.\n\nAND it doesn't run FLASH (Apple doesn't allow it), so I can't watch FLASH-based videos or see anyone type of FLASH-based web content on an iPad.\n\nNo more iPads, no more iPods (we have 2 iPads and several iPods) and no more updates (unless totally desperate)!

I also put some educational apps for my 2 year-old son and he loves them too.  The speed is great (no lag time opening and closing apps, safari, photos, and anything else).

We still have been unable to update it to iOS 5 because our wifi kept disconnecting on wifi on laptop but I think when we do that it will be faster. First day he had some slowness but not everything is great. We looked at getting some of the tablets on the android market and went to best buy to review. I liked the idea because the androids are more customizable but had reservations because 1. They are about the same price as iPads 2. Wasn't sure if I wanted to take that risk. 3. I have iPhones and know how dependable they are. However I found the toshiba thrive and it was cheaper. So that was our main focus. Toshiba thrive vs. iPad 2. On one hand the toshiba had USB ports, sd card ports and customization options, on the other if was not familiar with it. So we tried them both at best buy. Toshiba thrive looked better. It's graphics looked more fun, apps are cheaper..mostly free and all that. But it was more complicated, which i love because I like to tween things. My husband on the other hand...does not. So he wanted iPad...I wanted toshiba thrive but we wanted to talk to somebody who knew more about it. So we grabbed a guy who only deals with tablets. He said he has an android phone and likes it but as far as tablets go he said hands down iPad won. Reason was that apple makes one specific hardware for iPads. So they had it perfected. All their apps and music were specifically made for apple hardware so it had very little problems. Android market on the other hand is made from many different tablets, that are all made by different hardware. Therefore, if an app is made on a toshiba thrive, it may work great, but if you download it for your samsung thrive, the hardware is different so you are going to have more freezes with all, crashes or lack of working at all.\n\nIn conclusion, iPad 2 so far is more dependable and perfected. I do believe however, with time, the android market will be more perfected. As of now, I am siticking with my iPad 2!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I'm not an Apple fan by any means of the imagination, but I have to admit that I do own quite a few of their devices.  I learned my lesson to pick and choose what I feel most comfortable using and to not be so stubborn about supporting a company that I dislike.  I should say the only thing I dislike about Apple is their computer operating system.  It's not an operating system for me.  I don't feel comfortable using it and it is definitely much more boring than using a Windows operating system that has a gazillion more software written for it.  I'm a Windows guy, grew up with Windows and dabbled with Linux.  I tried to jump on to Linux band wagon long time ago and attempted to stick to it.  It was after several years that I realized Linux was likely not going ANYWHERE on the consumer side for the foreseeable future.  Linux will always be known as a great server operating system, reliable SAMBA share server, etc, but it will never surpass Windows or OS X.  Even Mac/OS X is popular among the consumers and look what this operating system is built on top of!\n\n  That being said, it does me no good to hate Apple just because I feel like it.  I bought their iPad 2 device and have been using it since it's initial launch (I did not buy it the first day of launch online, but definitely 3-4 days afterwards).  This device has been great since I purchased it the first day.  Yes, it does not support FLASH, but I realized this before I decided to buy the iPad.  The screen is sharp, the performance is fast and the screen touch is extremely responsive.  The battery life is really good compared to other devices (e.g. iPhone 4s, iPhone 3Gs).  It is a device for casual usage, you browse, you email, you do stuff for leisure.  I sometimes forget to connect the iPad to the charger over night, but I have not had to charge this device for 2-4 days, depending on how heavy I use it.  It's not like the iPhone where I MUST recharge it each night or else it will DEFINITELY run down the battery to critical level.  Granted, it's the WiFi version so it does not have the techno-complication of having to deal with 3G.  iPad 2 is very stable and robust.  I am definitely the type of person who would take every opportunity to criticize an Apple device, but I have to admit that I have had absolutely no problems using this iPad device.  I have no experience with any other tablet device in the market, but if you are wondering if you should get one or if this is going to be a reliable device, I can definitely say it has been super reliable in all phase it was made for since I received it.  Again, it does NOT support Flash, so be aware of this before you purchase it.  It's light weight, does a LOT of tasks that you can do from a computer and has a whole ton of apps available.\n\n  If you want to compare it to a computer, don't try to completely compare it apples to apples (pun intended), because it still isn't as \"flexible\" as a computer.  My laptop has a built in physical keyboard and mouse, I do not have to purchase a separate keyboard or mouse like I would have to for a iPad (you have to use the virtual keyboard on the iPad).  I can truly multitask on my Windows laptop, on the iPad it's \"semi-multitask\" at most.  The iPad cannot come close to the laptop's 8GB memory, 750 GB hard drive laptop that can run VMWare, play online multi-player games, store files where-ever I want, in whatever directory I created.  There are SO many things I can do on a laptop that the iPad currently cannot do... so unless you ONLY browse, type a few emails, make a few purchases from Amazon/eBay or other available stores and maybe chat occasionally online... then don't expect this iPad to really replace a laptop or desktop (I'm typing this review via laptop as it faster to do than on an iPad).\n\n  One negative about the iPad, but it's not Apple's fault, the Apps that people sell may be written for the iPad only or for iPhone only but sometimes written for both.  This means that if the app was designed specifically for the iPhone and you buy it... then it will not LOOK optimized for the iPad since the screen size on the iPad will make it stretched.  If you purchase the app for the iPad, then it may not even be available for the iPhone (I haven't seen an app for the iPad available for the iPhone).  Often they sell TWO different versions of the same app for both devices, so you have to pay double the amount to use them on your two devices.  Again, this review is about the iPad device, not about how the apps are developed, so overall, the iPad 2 is awesome... highly recommended for a tablet purchase."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I'm a long time Android phone user, but I decided to give Apple a try when it came to a tablet.\n\nIn trying out different tablets in person, I found most of the Android tablets to be either too heavy and/or bulky, or cheap feeling.\n\nI also found Android 3.x (Honeycomb) to be difficult to use, and the tablets with Android 2.x just looking like a phone under a magnifying glass.  The Motorola Xoom appeared to be very well built, but a little on the heavy side.\n\nWhen I tried an ipad after sifting through the sea of Android tablets at the local electronics store, I was sold instantly.  The user interface is so smooth and simple compared to Android.  I also knew that Apple products are typically less buggy than Android.  I've had a lot of difficulties with the bugginess of all my Android phones.  I may have been more courageous to try an Android tablet if more of them had support from Cyanogenmod.  As of now, there are only two Android tablets (not great ones) that they officially support.  Android 4.0 is coming soon, and looks promising, but that's yet to be seen.\n\nThe ipad is so smooth to the touch, and so comfortable in the hands... it's competitors are no match in initial impressions.\n\nAfter having plenty of time to play with it, I have mixed feelings about it.\n\nThere are some drawbacks.  Every time you download something from itunes (including music, videos, apps, and books) it asks for your password (if you haven't entered it in the last 15 minutes).  It even asks for your password when downloading free items.  I understand that this was a measure to stop children from running up bills on their parents accounts, but I don't have children, and there is no way to disable this feature.\n\nIn the appstore, there are a lot of free apps, but I feel there are many more for free in the Android market.  I like free apps.  I don't like paying huge costs for hardware, then still having to pay for every little thing I need it to do.  But that appears to be the case here.  I have found some cool stuff for free, though.  It's just riddled with ads.\n\niOS 5.0... I guess that's the big thing right now, but I'm not that excited about it.  My ipad shipped with 4.3 and I could barely tell the difference after the update.  If they were trying to gain Android's strengths with that update, they FAILED.  iOS defnitely does have it's own strengths, though.\n\nI am absolutely astonished at the battery life on the ipad.  I can play games all night, while connected to wifi, and occasionally streaming videos... and by some miracle, I still have plenty of battery life left.  My phone (Motorola Droid 3) would not stand for this... it's dead as a doornail before I get to 3 hours of playing games on it.\n\nI previously owned a Kindle 3 e-reader, which persuaded me that paper books were still the best way to go.\n\niBooks changed my mind!  NO EXTERNAL LIGHT NEEDED! Unlike the Kindle or Nook.  You can read in the dark without disturbing your bedmate.  It actually looks and acts like an open book, too!  I'm so excited about that.  When you flip the page, you literally touch the edge of the page on the screen and flip it like a book's page!  The screen is very sharp, and brightness is adjustable to levels that are tolerable in the dark or in bright sunlight.  Honestly, it's completely worth being 3 times the cost of a Kindle just as an e-reader.\n\nInternet browsing is terrific.  Much better than I ever expected from a mobile device.  All this bickering about iOS not using flash... it must be old news.  I've loaded flash content on both Safari and the Dolphin browser (from the app store).  What's more... flash appears to be smoother on my ipad than on my flash supported Droid 3.\n\nAlso worth noting, the ipad docks to my car stereo just like my ipod classic does.  The stereo is able to maintain control over it just as it does an ipod (I read mixed reviews about this functionality).  The surprising thing... the stereo also charges the ipad (although, I believe it's at a slower rate).\n\nAll in all, the ipad is great, but I still feel the pinch of the lack of customization that I've enjoyed with Android.  In physical form, it has no competitor.  I'm happy with my purchase.\n\nCyanogenmod! This is a call for a port! Dual boot!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I first bought a Viziotab Android tablet from Costco, then my friend bought an iPad.  Not to be outdone, I bought an iPad as well.  Now I thought I'd be using my iPad more than my Android, but this has turned out not to be the case.  You see,  Android and iPad are two very different devices, with one device often doing things much better than the other one.  So I've found myself using each device for different purposes, and I've found my Android device to be much more practical for everyday use.\n\nHere's a summary of my findings over two weeks of using both devices:\n\nOS Stability:  The winner here is the iPad.  I've experienced occasional freezes on the Android tablet, along with delays and slowdowns.  The only delay I've experienced on the iPad is when I'm using Safari and want to type in an address in the address bar.  There is a small delay from when I type the 'www' to when it shows up on the screen.  No big deal.\n\nCamera:  iPad is far and away the winning choice here, especially since my Android device came with a shabby VGA camera.  I can't speak for other devices like Galaxy Tab, but the iPad with its front and rear facing cameras definitely wins.\n\nVideo Chat:  iPad.  Especially since my Android tablet doesn't, as yet, support this.\n\nScreen Resolution:  iPad.  What can I say about this, other than the difference is like night and day.  The Viziotab's screen resolution is, in a word, ugly.  It seems very one-dimensional compared to the iPad's.  The iPad screen is clear, bright, and attractive.\n\nBrowsing:  I'm going to give this one to Android.  Although iPad's browsing is fast and Safari is easy to use, Android has flash.  Yes, I know, the resource hogging flash!  But here's the thing about flash for me: There are a couple of mission-critical websites I use constantly  one is for my job) that use flash.  With the iPad, it's a no go -- unless you buy a third-party browser that supports flash.  So Android wins here.\n\nPhotos:  This is a toss up.  While iPad blows away Viziotab in terms of resolution, Android wins simply because you don't need to go through iTunes to sync your photo library.  I think I'll be using my iPad to share those photos from my recent trip to Hawaii, but if I need to 'manage' my photos I'll use my Android tablet.\n\nVideo:  Again, a toss up.  iPad presents videos beautifully, but management is a pain in the a**.  First, iPad doesn't support all video formats.  And second, you have to sync your videos through iTunes.  So, if I have that iPad-compatible video of my trip to Egypt, I'll share it on iPad -- otherwise I'll be using my Android tablet to manage my video collection.\n\nEmail: I was at first impressed by the iPad email app.  But I enjoy reading my email on Android.  Perhaps it's the Android's integrated GMail app, which makes viewing email a more pleasant experience.  iPad just seems awkward.  Android wins here.\n\nDownloading:  No contest here.  Android wins.  You can download anything to an Android tablet, including video and audio in multiple formats.  Android supports torrent downloading, too.  What can you download to iPad?  iTunes apps, music, and video, all of which come at a price.\n\nGames:  iPad wins.  I just can't see Android competing in this area.  Although I'm not a big mobile-device gamer, so it doesn't really matter to me.\n\nBluetooth connectivity:  iPad supports Apple devices.  Android supports everyone's devices.  Android wins.\n\nApps:  A toss up.  App store wins for number of apps, and for integration with iPad.  Market wins for functionality.  I like ebooks, for example, and have ebooks with Barnes and Noble and Kindle.  But Apple has hamstrung the Nook and Kindle apps buy taking away the ability to download books through the iPad apps.  And there will be no app available through the app store that duplicates any other functionality that would eat iinto Apple's profits.\n\nViewing Videos on your HDTV:  With the purchase of a $5 HDTV cable I can view beautiful, high resolution movies and TV shows on my HDTV with my Viziotab.  With iPad you have to buy Apple TV ($99) and then are limited to iTunes store purchases.  Viziotab is the winner here.\n\nIn conclusion, I like the iPad for its big, beautiful display and ease of use.  I don't like it for its limitations, like lack of bluetooth connectivity, file management capability, and file format support.  I will keep my iPad to share videos and photos of vacations, and to use if I have to video conference with someone.  Which will probably be never, but at least it's there!  And for the cool apps that I do like.  Not so much for browsing or file management.  If I were to have to choose between the two, I would choose Android simply because it is wide open compared to iPad. If I sit on the couch to surf, I'll use Android because I know there will be no artificial barrier between me and the world wide web.  And if I go on vacation, I will take the Android with me for compatibility reasons.\n\nBuying advice:\n\n If you're an Apple user already and are immersed in the Apple ecosystem of products and services, compatibility probably is not an issue for you, so I would choose iPad.  If, however, you're not an Apple user I would carefully weigh the compatibility issues.  The iPad effect wears off eventually, and you have to realize the iPad is a device that does some things really well, other things not so well, and a few things not at all.  If those things it does 'not at all' are things you need it to do, then you might be well advised to get one of the Android tablets to better serve your needs.  Or, if you're like me and can afford it, why not get both?"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Everyone was at awe and full of excitement when the Apple iPad 2 was announced, but how does it really stand up to the competition and is it worth the upgrade? Now that it has been released for six months and I own one, along with the first generation iPad and a HP Touchpad. I feel I am one person that can give a fair review of the item. Examining how the iPad 2 is an improvement over the original on the outside, inside, and how it compares to the Touchpad in terms of hardware and software is a great way to show why the iPad 2 is worth buying.\n When first grasping the iPad 2, you notice it is much thinner than the iPad 1. It is approximately the same thickness as a simple pencil; you may ask how does it not break? Well it is construced of aluminum on the back and gorilla glass on the front. The gorilla glass in the iPad 2 is double the strength of the similar type of glass used in the first generation iPad. The testers at the website Gizmodo.com compared these two pieces of glass with two pieces of wood and bending the glass between them. The iPad 2 glass stretched twice as far before breaking.  The glass is not perfect though, it will break it dropped without a case because it is indeed glass. Unlike the iPad 1, the iPad 2 has special tiny magnets built in around the screen that allows Apple's new product the smart cover to be usable. The cover sticks to the iPad 2 and wakes up the iPad when the cover is removed. This interesting feature is a feature not available with the first iPad. The screen size and resolution is the same as the original iPad, with a 9.7\" IPS technology screen and a 1024x768 resolution. A new addition to the iPad 2 is the cameras on both the front and the back of the device. The front facing camera, similar to that of the one in the Apple iPhone 4 is mainly used for skype and video conversations. The camera on the back is a low one megapixel camera, and is quite grainy. I cannot imagine anyone having a use for this and I myself have never found a use for it. It still is better than the originals iPad's though, since it does not even have a camera.  The iPad 2 can also be bought in the color white, unlike the original. I bought my iPad 2 from Apple.com the night it was available and got it in a few days with free shipping.\nThe internals have gone through a drastic change between the two iPads. Apple, along with every other technology giant upgrades their devices to meet the latest technology. Apple has shown this by upgrading from the slower A4 single-core processor in the original iPad to the faster and much smoother dual-core A5 processor found in the iPad 2. The random access memory or RAM has been doubled between the two devices from 256 megabytes to 512 megabytes. The RAM upgrade allows more webpages to be open simultaneously in applications such as skyfire and safari. On the original iPad if you open ten pages at once, the device is quite slow and can even become unresponsive; on the new iPad ten pages is no problem, with no slowdowns. The speakers are the same in both iPad's, although the placement of them is a bit different. The hard drive storage options are the same in both devices, depending on how much you need. Available options are as low as 16GB to as high as 64GB. The video memory has also been upgraded in the iPad 2, allowing games such as Infinity Blade to run quickly and look much better, more realistic even. The figures in Infinity Blade look more closely to real humans than those shown on the first iPad. Overall it is good upgrade to the original in my opinion, since the price of the two is the same starting out.\nKnowing the iPad 2 is a good improvement over the original, how does it compare to similar tablet computers in the market? I own an HP Touchpad which is a similar tablet and it is a close comparison. The Touchpad features the same type of display, sporting a 9.7\" IPS technology screen just as the iPad 2. I consider the two being a tie in this category, because there really is not much of a difference. When it comes to overall shape the Touchpad is shorter than the iPad but the same width. I do not see this as being much of a difference either. The iPad 2 is considerably lighter than the touchpad it feels like, this should not matter too many people, the difference is not to major, and with a case the weight equals out. The touchpad has smaller hard drive options than the iPad 2; having only 16GB and 32GB options. I do not know many people that would use the full 64GB of data that can be bought in an iPad 2, but if you need that much than the iPad 2 would be the device to go with. Both my iPad 2 and touchpad have 16GB of data and I do not find myself looking for more space at all. My original iPad has 64GB of data and if I did not put my movies on it, I would have no use for the full 64GB. The camera comparison between the iPad 2 and the touchpad is another tie. While the touchpad only has one, front facing camera, it is of a much higher quality than both of the cameras on the iPad 2. Since the touchpad does not have a camera on the back and iPad 2 does, I give them a tie.  The touchpad has a dual-core processor, just as the iPad 2, but it is .2 gigahertz faster. The .2 gigahertz does not seem to make much of a difference, but since the speed is clocked faster, I give this to the touchpad. The battery life on the touchpad is very close to that of both iPad's. I do not notice much faster drainage between the three devices. A notable difference in the two devices is the speaker quality. The iPad 2 has decent speakers but not the best on the market; on the other hand, the touchpad uses higher quality beats audio, which is argued as some of the best on the market in 2011. It shows this, the sound quality on any music is like comparing static to clear, smooth sound between the two devices.  When it comes to price, originally they were both tied at $499 for the base price, but now the touchpad has been lowered to an extremely good, low price of $99. If you are on a budget and want a nice tablet, the touchpad is for you.\nWhen it comes to software, I have to say the iPad 2 dominates this category all around. The touchpad, which runs on WebOS is a system that does not have near the developers or supporters that the iPad 2 and the app store has. The app store has well over 500,000 applications that can be downloaded for free, or for a small fee to the iPad, whereas the touchpad has only a few 1,000. This attracts many more people to the iPad 2 because there is many more applications for anything you can think of in the app store, the selection of apps is very limited if you are buying the touchpad. If you are using a phone as a main internet connection, you will notice trouble when trying to connect the touchpad to the internet; this is because the touchpad does not support ad-hoc networks. This is a downfall for people like me that live on the iPhone internet tethering; the iPad 2 does support these networks and has no trouble connecting. For most people this will not be an issue but it something that should be known and that I was not aware of when I bought the touchpad. When using the touchpad, it is just as fluid as the iPad 2 when it comes to scrolling between pages of applications and searching through the device.  WebOS itself is not a bad system to use, and if it had more applications I believe it would be a great system.\nIf you are stuck on deciding a tablet computer to buy, ask yourself what you are expecting. If you want just a simple tablet computer, with no cameras, lots of apps and good ability to function, the iPad 1 would be good. Although if you want a nice, newer tablet with a camera you have to decide how much your budget is? The iPad 2 and the touchpad are close in mostly every category besides the selection of apps, is the price difference of $400 worth the app store? I myself believe the iPad 2 is a wonderful device to have and use if your budget can afford it, otherwise I would highly recommend the $99 HP touchpad."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Pros: The iPad 2 is by the best selling tablet out there. Comparing to other tablets the ipad 2 is far more efficient and worth every penny. You have a front facing webcam to chat with all your facetime buddies and if you have an application you can even chat with android users as well! The touch screen is both elegant and accurate to the exact point of your finger. Also with the new A5 dual-core 1Gz processor this will surpass any applications. However im telling you all the pros about the product and I'm not one of those all out apple fan boys I believe every device out there has a purpose but some are more worthwhile for your money.\n\nCons: Despite all the good looks and great hardware and software the device is fragile and you must buy a case for it or its prone to scratches unlike most android device they have a much more durable glass one known as gorilla glass. Also the camera isn't even barely a megapixel the quality of the images are horrible and you have a vga front facing camera.\n\nOverall: this is a great buy because the amount of application offered from apple's App Store benefits you more than Androids app store. I have to admit apple's app store has a higher quality of apps and a lot better utilities and such. I use this alot for school so its the perfect tablet to use a researching tool and typing up notes and organizing my work."}

He LOVES the Sandra Boynton apps and is confused by the physical book versions since the characters don't move like they do on the iPad 2.\n\nThis was a great purchase for me and my family that we will enjoy for years to come."}

Due to life taking it's own twist s & turns I was going to have to put off my purchase until next year. My boy friend bought me a poleroid e-reader 2 weeks ago to get me out of the living room after he went to sleep for the reading light as I'm addicted to everything Terry Prachet. Needless to say, while I was happy to be in our bedroom the e-reader is very limited in it's format & unless you know what your reading by heart your going to get lost thanks to missing text. Of course I am very thankful that he wanted to be generous & tried to be helpful but he knew I was unimpressed. So two days ago I was woken up to close my eyes & hold out my hands. He bought me the iPad2! The camera's are awesome, the size is twice as big yet the same weight as the e-reader. The already installed apps are great & navigating app store is so easy, let alone almost every site online that I have been to so far (20 of my favorite online news, shopping, weather etc.) already has a free app for the iPad2. There are a few interesting quirks though...\n\n1) You must have a pc to install the operating system through I tunes, but you can also go to an Apple store & they will help you.\n2) While it comes already installed with a YouTube app the videos aren't the best versions (due to their FLASH) but you do get the site, with most videos & songs.\n3) Apple IPad2 is not compatible with adobe FLASH... Not on the apps or if you just use the safari operating system to connect to the browser of your choice.\n4) No more zynga games, (Mafia Wars etc.) on Facebook if this will be your only mode of internet connection.\n5) The apps pages are in most cases very cool & graphically stimulating, however I am learning going to the same site using safari will have different content. In the case of Facebook, I couldn't view the links posted by my friends to my wall when using the Facebook app.\n6) The yahoo messenger app takes up the entire iPad screen & I tended to forget it was signed on to learn I was missing conversations due to web browsing... or sitting around waiting for a response.\n\nThe iPad has made the last 2 days of after dinner family movies more tolerable, as the toddlers can watch their Disney movies. While I enjoy Netflix on the couch, they sung & danced to their hearts desires without me getting frustrated that I can't see Eric & Arial get thrown out of the boat for the 5 billionth time. Bed time has been fun for us all, as they are amazed I read them a color book (The little engine that could... Free in I-books) up in thier bedroom on my, \"tiny nooooooo touchy TV\".\n\nI LOVE MY IPAD2!!!! None of the aforementioned quirks are irritating enough to walk away, just things I don't know enough about or need to get used to. Considering the auto spell hasn't inspired me t9, I mean *59... ugh! Hasn't made me throw it out the window yet. But I can turn it off in the settings, which is a really cool feature with all kinds of settings & features I haven't fully jumped into yet.  You can buy the 500gb wifi external hard drive to store your movies & video's on, (as it's not expandable) plus share ability with up to 2 or 3 others, at the same time. So really it's only draw back is the whole Adobe Flash issue or I would think it is absolutely perfect!\n\nI knowI will go back to using my laptop from time to time, but right now I am so excited & inspired to find all the ways I can enjoy & use this clever machine it's going to be a while."}

Ok....then buy an iPod Touch and write letters, and read articles and/books, watch videos, etc. on that tiny little screen. One of the major points of the iPad is it's larger screen!!  Some guy wrote about how the iPad sucks because of fingerprints on the screen. Really??? He must have filthy fingers!! When using my iPad I don't ever see fingerprints that get in the way of using the device. Oh sure, I see them when the unit is OFF, and then I wipe it clean if needed. But when it's on?? Please.\nThe iPad can be used for almost anything we normal people do- reading, entertainment, shopping, surfing the web. No flash?? True....but really, there are not that many instances that pop up where the lack of Flash is a problem. If it were a real problem, then Apple would not have sold tens of millions of the device thus far. I don't know about others but I know my company switched their entire website to one with HTML 5- good bye Flash. I'm guessing that's going to happen more and more. It has no USB or video out ports?? Ok....then don't buy it! It's amusing how people \"purchase\" the iPad and then moan and complain that it has no USB port or HDMI out ports. Really? You mean....you didn't know that when you bought it?\n  Seriously, some of the naysayers for this product that say \"it sucks\" and so on are clueless. This is a FANTASTIC product! Ok....so it IS a little pricey, I'll given them that. But then, so is the Galaxy Tab. Most products of this type that cost much less simply are not worth it. Maybe the Kindle Fire will be? Who knows?

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Ok, my wife got the black 16GB several months ago and I inherited a Nook Color which I though would be good enough to use for surfing the web, email, editing and publishing documents, etc...  and after several months of frustration, and seeing how well that iPad 2 worked, I decided to get myself one.\n\n*WOW*\n\nI'm not trying to bash the Nook Color, it is nice for reading magazines and books, not as pleasing on the eyes as the larger iPad 2 screen, but it works.  It's probably more of the limitations of the Android OS that is so frustrating to me, and the lack of real world applications for it.  Yes it has an abundance of applications, but no real apps to do work it seems.\n\niPad 2 has apps like Pages and Numbers that integrate seamlessly with their counterparts on the computer.  On the other hand Android devices have something called Quickoffice PRO which is supposed to allow you to edit and transfer Office documents between the device and the desktop...  sounds good, but after paying $14.00 for the app I cannot use ANY document with ANY type of formatting on the Android, and the smaller screen makes it hardly usable.  In contrast the only issues I have with Pages is if there is a font that is not available on the iPad, but is on the desktop computer, and I can always find another one that will fit the bill.\n\nThe iPad 2 is way ahead of Androids in terms of touchscreen recognition.  The Android was constantly doing things that I didn't want it to do.  For instance I would be attempting to scroll the screen and often times it would instead select an item or link from the screen.  That was uber-frustrating at best.  Trying to do anything on it was a labor of love I guess.  I oft times just got frustrated and moved to a computer to get something done.  The iPad by contrast seems to know exactly whatI am trying to do...  rarely do I have a touchscreen error.\n\nThe iPad 2 is sleek, elegant, and has a large enough screen to actually get some work done.  Surfing the web is a breeze and despite the complaints about the lack of a flash plug-in, I surf with relative ease.  Speaking of flash, yes Androids have that, but it doesn't work very well on them.  I struggled on web sites with flash on my Android.  Often times the page would not display correctly anyway, so that's kind of a wash.  And Microsoft is canning flash in Windows 8 as well.  It looks like Steve was right... flash is going away.\n\niOS 5 with iCloud is an iDream (pun intended).  I can sync all my contacts, my wife's contacts, calendars, Aperture photos, etc...  without any real user interaction.  Just turn the services on and go.  Makes me re-think that OS X Lion Server purchase I made, but I still need that for the older Macs running Tiger and Leopard on my network, and at some point I will probably turn on that XSAN server to create a local SAN RAID...\n\nNumbers files work perfectly and seamlessly between the iPad 2 and the desktop computer, formulas, etc.  That's another problem I had with the Android Quickoffice, it would not understand complex and sometimes simple formulas, so I couldn't use spreadsheets on it at all.\n\nGenerally the applications for iOS are far more mature and polished than those available for Android.  The user experience is without a doubt far superior on the iPad 2, apps like Hulu Plus were not even available on the Android which sort of left me scratching my head.  I do have an Android phone that has Hulu Plus on it, so I'm not certain why there wasn't one for the tablet, but it rendered what could have been a nice TV show watching device into a useless for TV device.\n\niPad 2 is sleek, sexy, stylish, yes.  But it is also a serious workhorse if you are like me and want to do real world work on it.  With a combination of the iPad, and iWork.com I am able to create documents on the iPad or desktop computer, save them to iWork.com, and download them anywhere in any of three possible formats (Pages, PDF, or Word).  The translation to word documents is nearly as flawless as the other transfers, again, sometimes there is a font issue, but that is rare and is easy to fix.\n\nAnother problem I had with the Android was the lack of iTunes for it.  Much of my music library is still DRM protected and the Android wouldn't play those files.  iPad 2 by contrast sync's right up and has every one of my songs available to play, and speaking of iCloud -- I have more computers than I need, and having that many leads to problems like the old \"you can only have 5 computers authorized\" when I try to authorize another iTunes library to sync my music.  iCloud eliminates that problem, your new purchases automatically are downloaded from the cloud. And storage is not really an issue with iPad 2 specifically... get the Camera Adapter kit and you can use all the SD cards you want with it.\n\nBack to the iPad 2 - if you are looking to buy a tablet type of computer and are on the fence between an iPad and another, shall I say \"knock-off\", dig into the details.\n\nSome of the Androids may be better than the Nook Color in terms of power, response, screen size, etc... but none of them have a decent office suite or iTunes, they don't have as many accessories available for them, you'll have to use a variety of different services to get iCloud functionality, you cannot use iWork.com with them, Apps are not as abundant and generally are not as mature/polished, syncing with your desktop is a headache - if you can even get it to, etc...\n\nOverall this is one of the best, if not THE best Apple product available.  I have a lot of Apple products these days due to the ease of use, this one is one of the easiest to use and I HIGHLY recommend it!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "...but I love it!\n\nI was skeptical at first for getting one because the specs didn't/doesn't seem to justify the price.  I have a laptop, desktop and a very good Android phone so I didn't really need this.  But I've owned many Apple products (Macs and iPods) too, but never an iOS device.  So, as a birthday gift, I wanted to splurge (haha).\n\nNot to sound like an Apple ad/fanboy (or SJ-RIP), but I do like its `convenience.' I like that I can `lounge' with this instead of being at my desktop, having to deal with the bulk of a laptop or the small size (and power) of my smartphone.  The touchscreen is very responsive and the image quality (be it pictures, web pages, video-especially HBO) is great.  There is little to understand or setup (except connecting it to your wifi, if you got a wifi only; if you know/use Apple, Android or Windows, you'll figure it out easily).  I got a 32 gig because I wasn't sure what my ratio would be for apps vs. media/pic content (even with Apple's cloud service).\n\nGranted, it has some limitations (be it lack of `flash,' getting used to the onscreen keyboard and some multi-tasking capabilities), but its conveniences do make up in its usefulness (that is, if you use it for web surfing, checking email, using apps, etc).  I've had to stop myself at times from saying `I'm doing those things on such a thin device'-haha.\n\nI'll say that this is a very good `half-top,' that is, half a desktop/laptop.  It isn't to replace my computer or smartphone, but I do find myself using this more in leisure than my actual computer (haha).  I know there are less expensive tablets and/or tablets with better software/hardware specs.  But this device is a delight to have when/if you don't want to use your smartphone or computer."}

I received the IPad 2 as a gift from my daughters.  When I first opened the IPad2, it was WOW.  Now that I have used it for 2 weeks, here is my opinion.  It SUCKS.  No offense to the IPad lovers.  Here are the reasons:\n\nThe IPad2 lists at $499 with a puny 16GB memory.  After you load a few apps, your memory is down to say 14 GB.  There is not much you can hold with only 14GB...music, videos, pictures nowadays eat up a ton of memory.  If you want a higher memory, you have to buy the 32 or 64GB, at $599, and $699 respectively.  And even so, the last time I had a 64GB storage capacity is when I had my Atari Computer back in the 80's (ok..i'm exaggerating..but you get the point).  Apple calls 64GB a progress?  And some people hail Steven Jobs as the great innovator?  This is going backwards in time.\n\nThe IPad storage capacity is NOT UPGRADABLE.  You have to sell the old one and buy a new one.  This is how Steve Jobs made a lot of money, off of a lot of unsuspecting customers.  What puzzles me is why do some continue to patronize such marketing program.\n\nThere are a few things you can do to overcome the small storage, such as, carry a bunch of SD cards, preload it with files and use the camera kit to view.  Some suggest using an external harddrive which you again have to preload with the files you intend to use.  Others suggest using online data storage which you have to pay, somewhere between $10-30/month, and mind you, you have to be online to access these files...so if you do not have WIFI or 3G access, you are SOL.\n\nIf I have to do the above to gain storage, what have I gained from IPad2?  I thought the IPad2 is about ease of portability?  Not to mention the additional money one has to spend on the additional accessories.\n\nThe 3G data capability adds $129 to the IPad2.  Bear in mind, you still have to subscribe to the 3G data.  If you are on the go, the 3G would be helpful.  However, the 3G is not all dependable depending on where you're at.  The 3G signals in China, Hongkong, and Macau were unreliable.  In mainland China, I was able to get \"some\" 3G data, but none is HongKong and Macau, even when there were strong signals....something to do with prioritization...they give their local subscribers priority, and you get the scrap signal (This is according to T-Mobile).  Maybe this only happens in China.\n\nIPad has NO ethernet cable connection.  While it appears that more and more places are now going WIFI, there are still a lot of good hotels using ethernet cables.  Sometimes you have to go to the lobby (a great inconvenience) to get your best WIFI signal (so, being able to use the ethernet cable in the room would be more convenient).  And there are still a few hotels that don't offer WIFI.  Then what?  You are SOL, unless you bring your own WIFI router.  So I ask again, if I have to bring a router for these rare occasions, am I not defeating the purpose of the ease of portability?\n\nThe IPad2 was not able to open a video clip from my Canon T2i (format is .mov).  Later I hear Ipad only supports apple video formats.  It does not run Flash based content.  It does not run Java.  What the?\n\nI still thank my daughters for gifting me the IPad2.  At the least it brought me up to date with technology...I know what I'm not missing...I can say I know what it is...and I can speak intelligently about the Ipad...it's overrated."}

This product has literally helped me get over my Ex. Ipad 2 is so much more than just a lareger ipod toch instrument.  People making such claims don't seem to have used one. I agree that because applications are similar and they both share the same iOS, the experience might not seem that different, but once you get your hands on it, the bigger screen, the dual core processor, larger memory and longer battery so I like it better."}

Although I have multiple iPods and also an iPhone owner, this is the first time we are getting ourselves an iPad in the household.\n\nThis is wonderful device. Just like what they did in the IpodTouch, the amazing thing is how they were able to squeezed so much technology in such a small space.\n\nBy the way, this is a review of the iPad 2.  The first iPad, we skipped it completely.  There are many tablets in the market but it is really tough to compete with iPad. First, the interface.  This is what Apple is known for.  The simplicity, usability and ease of use of such a very compliated hardware is a miracle in itself.  I have tried other devices that are similar but the most of them seems to be  a  tad slower and  less smart.\n\nAnother big factor that is strongly going for the iPad is the number of apps availalble in the Apple store.  Android is starting to compete, specially now with big online stores like Amazon taking the challenge.  Still, it will take some time to really match the number and the quality of the apps in iTunes. Apple is also known for being strict in approving apps being sold in the App store.\n\nFunny thing is, what made me pull the trigger to finally buy an iPad despite the high tag price is the HP Touchpad fiasco.  I ordered one when it was advertised for $99.  I was ecstatic to have my order received and placed through Barnes & Noble,  only to be notified the next day that my order was cancelled.  Due to frustration, I walked in to the closest Apple store and got me one.\n\nWhat really amazed me is the usefullness of the tablet in education. I have heard so many times that it is good for kids who have autism and one of my kids was diagnosed with autism. He is so focused when playing with it.\nMy kids have DSs but most of the games are just for fun and entertainment. They get a little bit of learning at the beginning, but after that it is repetitive and just time waste.\n\nThere are amazing educational apps like the following:\n- Word Bingo\n- Math Bingo\n- Teach Me\n- Presidents vs Aliens\n- Stack the States.\n- Brainquests series\n- Write On (for learning cursive writing)\n\nNO FLASH:\n\niPad2 still does not support flash.  There are Aps that you can use to play flash on websites  like iShifter, etc.  It is not perfect but at least it works.\n\nSKYPE:\n\nOne of the advantages the iPad2 against iPad1 is that now you can do video calls with Skype or Yahoo Messenger."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I was apprehensive re: dropping a nice piece of change on a tablet and wasn't really sure if I really needed a tablet. I have a couple of laptops and have owned a netbook for a couple of years. I bought the netbook because of its portability, size, and relative light weight when I am on the road.\nThrowing caution to the wind, I bought this  Ipad2 and it was instant love. Installation was a snap and took a matter of minutes per the instruction card which comes with the device as well as accompanying online prompts. There are a huge number of applications available for the IPad and many of them are free; others are available at minimal cost. The learning curve for using this device is fast; if you own an IPhone it is even faster. The platform this is built on is similar in operation to the IPhone. As for installing new apps, I have yet to encounter any installation problems with my add ons, though some people have.\nIf you install the ereader app, it negates the need for a Kindle or Nook. While I'm not about to toss my Kindle, this is a nice alternative to carting around yet another device when I travel.\nThe battery's charge is supposed to last about 10 hours. That is a fairly accurate measure as I've been averaging about 9 to 10 hours before draining the charge.\nThe device's design is truly a work of art. While this is not a very constructive comment re: to buy or not to buy, I'm driven by aesthetics. I'm drawn to attractiveness and functionality. I own a lot of Apple products and their purchase has partially been driven on visual appeal and cleverness, though ultimately i have fallen in love with their ease of operation and their ability to go way beyond most folks'  imagination. What I am trying to say is that even if you buy this blindly assuming that it will do most of the things your laptop does you'll probably be surprised by its many added features. The  Ipad2 is very light and portable. It is easy to hold and with a smart cover or case that converts to a stand, it works great on a  flat surface or a lap. It can slip easily into a purse. I usually carry a small or medium Ameribag and have no problem getting it to fit. In order to keep this pad in pristine condition and safe, I installed a screen protector, a back cover, and a smart cover. For what it's worth, this pad is nifty but I wouldn't try to see if it will bounce if dropped. Additional accessories are readily available such as Bluetooth keyboards, headsets, and external speakers.\nThe 32 GB capacity is more than adequate for my needs. However, an application junkie may need 64GB. I mention this because my son is upgrading because he wants to add more apps and is running out of space. 16GB or 32GB is probably adequate for most users.\nResponse time is robust on this little sucker. While I didn't buy the 3G model, I haven't had a problem attaching to free WiFi and reception has always been good given that I'm usually in populous areas.\nThe pad's sound quality is good as well as the screen's image. The camera is o.k., but I prefer my IPhone's camera or better yet a high res dedicated camera.\nWhile I had no previous experience with IPad's first incarnation, IPad2 seems to be an improvement over the first release due to\nfaster processing speed and a lighter and more compact design. While there is no slot for an SD card, I suspect that subsequent IPads will feature better and/or more sophisticated cameras and video conferencing capabilities, and an SD card slot among other things.\nBottom line: the IPad2 is a fantastic device that is more versatile  than a netbook but lacks some of the functionality of a fully integrated laptop. It's compact size and light weight is a big draw as is its ease of operation and performance."}

Our experience has been different. It is difficult to operate.  First it is hard to get acquainted with.  Few instructions come with it.  One has to find the information on line.  It is a lengthy PDF file that is not user friendly.  One needs to read through it carefully.  It took a while to find the on switch.  When it opened there were no apps on the screen.  With no information it took several minutes to learn by trial and error how to slide the screen to find them.  Synchronizing with one's computer is not explained except in several different sections of the instructions.  Getting connected to a wifi router is another mystery to be solved.  There are thousands of \"free\" apps that turn out to be advertisements to buy what you really hoped for in the download.  Books are difficult to down load and don't appear on one's bookshelf but are in various locations.  Paper books are more appealing now.  I can share a paper book.  Though it costs more it gets more value out of it.  The \"10 hours\" of running time is really 10 hours unplugged.  Over all it is frustrating to use and not worth the price."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "After five months of using a 16GB iPad 2 WiFi (no 3G), I can honestly say that it is one of the most useful technology purchases I can think of. While its price may scare many people away, its usefulness can justify its price, especially when compared to other devices that perform similar tasks. Not a day has gone by in the last five months where the iPad 2 hasn't been used several times, usually by several family members.\n\nApple would like everyone to think that the iPad is revolutionary. Skeptics and critics scoff at the idea, but I would agree that it is a revolutionary product much in the same way that the Netbook (ASUS eeePC, et al) was a revolutionary product.\n\nBoth products created a new paradigm in how you look at accessing information, media, and other tasks, and once you use them, you find it difficult to go back to the traditional devices. Netbooks nearly killed laptops, but in turn are getting killed themselves by tablets. People loved the small size of netbooks, but the keyboards and displays were often too small. Compared to an iPad, a typical netbook is too clunky and too heavy. Those with the need for a keyboard need the larger keyboard that a laptop provides, and those that don't embraced tablets as quickly as they could.\n\nUsing the iPad for any length of time will make you not want to use your desktop PC for browsing the web or reading E-Mail. It's much more natural to hold a tablet in your lap or place it on the table next to you while having breakfast than it is to go into the other room and use a PC to do the same. Laptops are more portable than desktop PC's, but in comparison, they are much bulkier and many laptops have horrible battery life that don't come close to the 10 hours that one can get from the iPad 2.\n\nThat's not to say that desktop and laptop PC's don't have their place. They definitely do. If you're doing anything complex that requires a keyboard or a mouse, those other devices shine. However, if you're composing a normal E-Mail, browsing the web, reading news feeds, checking Facebook, or watching videos on Hulu or YouTube, the iPad does these things very well. Typing on the on-screen keyboard, especially in landscape mode, is very easy and I've gotten quite fast at doing so. The picture quality on the screen is very good; probably better than most laptop and desktop PC monitors are, and the touch interface is so natural that it doesn't require hardly any orientation to get comfortable using the interface.\n\nBrowsing the web is a joy on the 10\" screen. Sure, not having Flash compatibility is a pain sometimes, but Flash is one of those technologies of the past that is dwindling in popularity with the advent of HTML5, and it's in the site owner's best interests to develop versions of their sites that don't rely on Flash to do things that should have been done in other ways long before iOS devices came along. It's an occasional annoyance, but I don't consider the lack of Flash a dealbreaker in my mind. Web sites that don't work on the iPad are losing the business of the many that have iOS-based devices, and there are plenty of other sites that provide the same service that don't lean on the Flash crutch.\n\nReading E-Mail using the built-in E-Mail app is also very good. I prefer the sidebar list of E-Mails that appears in landscope mode over the popup menu listing in portrait mode, but that's a personal preference. GMail integration is smooth, and being able to access multiple accounts makes it easy to check several mailboxes, either in one megalist or as separate accounts. The calendar app integrates with Google Calendar and the contacts from GMail are available in the Contacts list on the iPad as well. The integration with Google's various apps is very good.\n\nOne of the best features of the iPad is the ecosystem that is built around the device. Apple has done a great job of supplying a major part of that by creating an AppStore with thousands of apps for just about every purpose one could think of. The iTunes store provides music, movies, and books for sale, but I prefer supplying my own music and movies, and Amazon's Kindle app / Kindle books is much more flexible and a better way to buy books in my opinion. On top of the software, the popularity of the iPad means that there are multitudes of accessories that cover the iPad, plug into the iPad, or otherwise complement the iPad in some way. No other portable device manufacturer has the 3rd party support that Apple has and that advantage shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nSpeaking of accessories, I did a lot of looking at cases, and I settled on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/AYL-100-Premium-Genuine-Slim-Leather-Case-Folio-with-Magnetic-Closure-and-3-in-1-built-in-Stand-for-Apple-Ipad-2nd-Generation-Tablet-Black/dp/B004WHI9L4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">AYL 100% Premium Genuine Slim Leather Case Folio with Magnetic Closure and 3-in-1 built-in Stand for Apple Ipad 2nd Generation Tablet (Black)</a>. It's a folio style cover that works very well in protecting the device while not adding too much bulk. I highly recommend getting some kind of case, and this one is nearly perfect.\n\nThe iPad 2 costs a lot of money. That makes it out of reach of some people, so it's not a slam-dunk. However, if you compare it to the cost of a new laptop or desktop PC, it's not out of line. If you're reading E-Mail, looking at videos, and browsing the web, the iPad does these things very well. You'll still need another device that will store your digital camera photos, keep track of your finances, and do the complex tasks that a desktop/laptop can do, but you'll need that device much less once you've discovered the ease of using something like this for those everyday tasks that don't require a full-sized keyboard and full-blown Windows programs to accomplish.\n\nNo other tablet device currently available on the market has come close to the capabilities and the ecosystem that the iPad enjoys. I had hopes that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ASUS-Eee-Pad-Transformer-TF101-A1-10-1-Inch-Tablet-Computer-Tablet-Only/dp/B004U78J1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101-A1 10.1-Inch Tablet Computer (Tablet Only)</a>&nbsp;would take it on, but it seems hampered by software issues (trying to do too much and be too flexible can be troublesome), the Androad app market still trails the iOS app market considerably, and the number of accessories available pales in comparison.\n\nThe best non-iOS device that I think has a chance of being a contender is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kindle-Fire-Full-Color-7-Multi-touch-Display-Wi-Fi/dp/B0051VVOB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi</a>. It has a great price point, it has Amazon standing behind it with an ecosystem that includes an AppStore, music store, video store for TV and movies, and the excellent Kindle books system, which is almost an ecosystem all by itself. I'm very interested to see how the Kindle Fire accomplishes the tasks of a tablet device and I hope that it can be a contender in the marketplace.\n\nAnyone interested in a tablet device should be looking at the major products that are available and see how those products serve their needs. While the iPad 2 is a major investment, I don't regret making the purchase. I think the iPad 2 is hard to beat!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Our son gave this iPad to my husband as a gift (a complete surprise since it is a pretty expensive gift!).  My husband had just purchased a computer for me as a birthday gift coincidentally, and it had a hard drive failure the 3rd time it booted up.  So we returned it and bought a second iPad 2 for me.  We are completely addicted.  They are so user friendly, work well, and are instant on and off (instead of waiting forever to boot up and shut down like a computer).  We both absolutely love them.\n\nYou iPad may not have the latest operating system on it since many have been sitting in stores waiting to be sold.  If it has 4.3.5 or older, then you simply can take it to a Verizon store and have them activate it at no charge.  They are an official Apple Store.\n\nIf you need to update your iPad 2 to the new IOS 5 that is to be released in October 2011, then I have some tips, to possibly prevent a lot of grief. HOWEVER, you can just skip all the rest of the technical part of my review if you pay a small fee to have operating system IOS 5 downloaded onto your new iPad 2 so that it is completely independent of a regular computer and iTunes. This is a huge step that Apple has been developing for awhile now.  I don't know if Verizon will do it for free, but Best Buy will do it for $29.95.  If you go to Verizon, make sure the employee is quite familiar with activating the iPad, etc.  Our local Verizon person acted like she knew, but when I brought it home, it wasn't activated.  That's why I had to go through all this stuff so I could do it on my own computer.\n\nThe current operating system as of today requires hook up to a computer that has iTunes on it.  The new \"IOS 5\" is due to come out in the next 10-15 days, between October 10-15, 2011.  Anyone who buys an iPad 2 that already has IOS 5 loaded and, also, anyone who already owns an ipad 2 who updates to this version; will be able to do everything without being dependent upon a computer and iTunes.  Right now, you upload photos, your own music, and download and install updates via your computer using iTunes on a regular computer. You can load these things by emailing to your iPad from your computer where they are stored, but if you have a lot, it is easier to transfer via iTunes on your computer.\n\nMy review is long and some is very technical.  You can stop here if I've already given you helpful info you wanted to know.  The very next section is about some apps I recommend and then after that is the very technical part that isn't necessary if you don't have a computer or want to take my suggestion and pay to have IOS 5 installed on your iPad.\n\n------\n\nBefore I get on with the heavy-duty technical part that you may or may not want read, let me recommend a few apps that you can purchased inexpensively.  Part of the fun is customizing your iPad with apps that you enjoy or help you with your tasks:\n\n1. A free app for the iPad is \"Goodreader.\"  This is a great app.  You can view about any format of a file in this app, even Excel files.  You can also make annotations with various symbols and highlighting that the program offers.  You can also unzip a zip file in Goodreader.  I've never done it, but you can watch a video in that app as well.  It has a great folder and file management system that is easy.  I believe you can even bring in files to your iPad from your computer via wi-fi or ftp.  You can also save a web page for reading off line when you are not near wi-fi, such as on an airplane.  I really like this program.\n\n2.  If you like to use Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, you can get these apps, but they are $20 each.  I have two excel spreadsheets that I like to keep up on a daily or weekly basis.  One, for example, are our household expenditures and deposits.  Since Goodreader doesn't let you actually add to a Word document or Excel file, I found a program called \"Office 2 HD.\"  This one is not free.  It is a $6.99 program plus fee and tax, but that is less than you pay for either Word or Excel.  It's pretty easy.  What I did was email to myself my Excel file from my computer.  I opened the email in iPad 2 and clicked on the attached file.  Then I tapped on the little curved arrow that you would tap if you want to reply to or forward an email and it gave me the option of opening the file in either Goodreader or Office 2 HD.  I selected Office 2 HD.  Then I opened that app, opened that file, and tapped the Save button.  The Save button gives you a choice of Save or Save As.  When you want to be able to type in the file, you choose Save As and rename it.  If you don't want to rename the file, than add a \"1\" to the file name on your computer before you email it to yourself on iPad; and then when you Save As, just delete the 1.  Easy.  Of course, it works differently inserting rows, etc., than a regular spreadsheet of Excel program, so you really do need to refer to their help menu.  I like the program though, because it is inexpensive and lets me keep up edit my favorite already existing spreadsheets.  You can create new ones also, of course.  I haven't used the word processor yet, but it is probably even easier than a spreadsheet.  Oh, it has a Power Point type program in it also.\n\n3.  Right now the default Safari brower on the iPad isn't very good.  I'm very spoiled to using tabs so I can open search listings in a new tab without losing my search page or use the tabs to go back and forth comparing info on two or three different web pages.  The new IOS 5 is giving Safari tabs.  However, I really like \"Web Perfect Browser\" which is only $3.99 plus fee and tax.  Not only does it provide a tab system for browsing, but will also save web pages for offline reading.  I save a web page in the Browser if it is something I want to read later, but not necessarily save.  I save a web page in Goodreader, if I want to keep it for reference.  I don't know all the changes they are going to make in Safari.  You might go ahead and check it all out before buying Web Perfect Browser in case it is good enough for your purposes.\n\n4.  A great picture organizer program is \"Photo Mgr Pro.\"  Once again, the new IOS 5 is making big improvements on the default photo.  Perhaps you won't even need this app.  The current default Photo app is terrible.  You cannot put them in the order you want.  As far as I know, the only way to create Albums (folders) is to arrange the folders you want in a special iPad folder on your computer first and then upload the special folder and its contents to the iPad through iTunes.  You still can't arrange the order, however.  I know they have made improvements in the new operating system; but if you don't like it, try the Photo Mgr Pro.  It's good.\n\nBy the way, the final price of an app varies because some are Apple apps and some are 3rd-Party developers.  The developers do get a fee from each purchase.  All apps have tax added.  I'm not sure how this works, but I do notice that the difference between the app purchase price and the final price is not always the same percentage.  However, apps are so reasonably priced, it just isn't that important.  Just know that when it says $3.99, it actually will be a little more.\n\n---------\n\nTHE TECHNICAL PART OF MY REVIEW REGARDING PROBLEMS UPDATING OR INSTALLING ITUNES:\n\nIt isn't a big deal using your computer and iTunes (if you have a computer) unless you have the following problems that I ran into.  Here are a couple of solutions below.\n\nDON'T LET MY INSTRUCTIONS SCARE YOU.  REMEMBER, you can just have IOS 5 put on it after its released, and you don't have to deal with any of this. By the way, if you don't have a computer, you can take the iPad to a Verizon store to activate it. They don't charge for it since they are contracted by Apple. Best Buy may also do it for a small fee when you don't buy it there.  Best Buy will also download and install updates for you for $29.95, so wait until the new IOS 5.0 is released and have them put that one on it.  That eliminates the computer and iTunes problem since you will be able update and download from the iPad. (I'm repeating, but knowing how to do this with ease and avoiding the problems is valuable to know.)\n\nNow back to the iTunes problem.  NOTE:  My instructions are for a PC with XP. It is possible you won't be able to install the latest version of iTunes.  You need a version later than the 9.0 and above series.  It must start with a 10.0 or later for it to be connected to your ipad.  I use version 10.4.1.  I discovered that since I apparently had some previous version of iTunes and/or Quick Time on my computer, it left behind some kind of language.  Therefore, after I downloaded itunes version 10.4.1 and attempted to install it; it appeared to install, but wouldn't open.  An error message appeared saying there were missing files.  After spending 3 days researching off and on for the solution and trying to reinstall etc., I finally found a document on the Internet stating exactly what to remove and how to do it. INSTRUCTIONS: From the PC via Add and Remove Programs in the Control Panel remove iTunes.  Then you remove Apple Application Support.  You don't have to uninstall Quick Time.  Then you close and reboot.  Don't open any programs, but do shutdown firewall and anti-virus programs and turn off your DSL/broadband.  Now you can go to your iTunes install file you saved and install it. Now it will work, or it may say something about Mobile Device Service not started. If so, open Control Panel again and open Administrative Tools.  Open the \"Services\" folder. Click ONCE on Apple Mobile Device folder.  To the left of the file, it says \"Stop the Service\" and \"Start the Service.\"  Click on \"Stop the Service\" and then click on \"Start the Service.\"  I can't remember if you reboot again, but it will tell you. After this, iTunes, should work just fine unless some other cause is creating your problem.\n\nNEXT PROBLEM that many people are having is that iTunes will perform all the functions for your iPad except it won't download an OS (Operating System) Update.  It will act like it's downloading, but eventually times out.  I have a solution, but you can confirm that your problem is the same as mine by doing the following:  Open iTunes and click on Help on the menu.  Select \"Run Diagnostics\".  Uncheck everything except the first line to do a Connectivity Test. Make sure your DSL or wi-fi is connected. Click Next. Click Next again and it will list test results.  The first two lines will have green dots, meaning ok.  The third line will be red, \"Secure Link to iTunes Store Failed.\"  What is peculiar about this is that I can purchase an app through the store, but can't download an update.  The problem is somewhere in conflicting language or programs.  After 3 more days of trying to fix, it I finally found a webpage that lists direct links to Apple and instructions.  You choose your particular kind of iPad; for example, iPad 2 wi-fi only.  Then you download the file and save it to a folder where you won't forget where it is.  Be aware that is is a 690 MG file!  It takes hours to download.  I have DSL \"light\" which means it is slower than regular hi-speed, so it took my file 8 hours to download. Make sure your Power settings say never so the computer won't sleep during the download.  It's ok if your monitor sleeps or the desk top activates a screen saver. By the way, I also was not able to download it on my computer than has iTunes.  I had to use my very old computer that has never had iTunes on it.  My itunes computer blocked downloads even directly from Apple!  If you don't have another computer, use someone else's computer that doesn't have iTunes. OR just wait for IOS 5 (release in Oct. 2011) and pay Best Buy $29.95 to download it and install! After downloading it, I put it on a flash drive and transferred it to my other computer that has iTunes.  Next, plug in iPad to your computer via the cable included; do this BEFORE opening iTunes.  If you haven't already activated your new iPad 2, then you will be activating it now through iTunes.  Once it is activated, you are ready to install the update you downloaded, which will IOS 5 after it released. iTunes may pop up a window that asks if you want to download the update.  Press Cancel.  If it is set up to automatically download it, press the X next to the field at the top where it is showing that is is downloading.  That will stop it.  NOW, since your iTunes will not work for downloading if you have the same connectivity issue that I do, you will HOLD DOWN your shift key WHILE you press the UPDATE button.  You will only see the UPDATE button if you plugged in your ipad first to your computer and then open iTunes.  A menu just for your iPad will appear across the middle of the screen and the Update button is on the Summary tab.  After you hold down the shift key while clicking on Update, it will pop up a screen allowing you to find your downloaded file.  If you computer downloaded it as a ZIP file, you'll have to unzip it first and then choose the file.  iTunes will now update your iPad with the new update.  It takes about 10 min or less.  By the way, I have Opera browser on my old computer and discovered that it doesn't force a zip file as some browsers do.  It will download the file as it actually comes with the correct file extension.\n\nHope this review doesn't scare you off.  Remember!  You don't have to deal with any of these problems if you pay a store that is set up for iPads to download the new IOS 5 operating system which makes iPad completely independent of a separate computer and iTunes.  Again, I don't know what Verizon would charge, but $29.95 is pretty good at Best Buy.  Call first to make sure the stores near you will do it.\n\nHave fun with Ipad 2.  It's great!  I'm quite advanced on PC's as I used them for the last 15 years for my jobs.  Now I'm retired, and the Ipad 2 is just great fun and new Apps to let you customize it for your own interests are very reasonable."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "My IPad2 probably has the worst operating system I have ever seen. I wonder at how something so weak could be so popular. I now see why there are so many Apps available that use work-around methods to try to make up for the lack of a more complete system.\n\nI bought an Apple II in the early `80s and soon had to learn to use workaround routines to produce acceptable results. When the IBM PC became available I bought one and discovered what a well-executed operating system was like. I used Microsoft DOS for 8 years before changing to Windows 3.1 which was slowly developed into the present Windows 7 version.\n\nIt looks like Apple is repeating the same cycle with the IPAD2. The system is so restrictive it limits any chance of even limited productivity. If you're only interested in playing games, email or rather poor quality photo images and video then you'll probably like the Ipad2. I will admit it's very stylish which is probably a big help with sales but you can't tell a book by its cover. I might suggest talking to someone who has one to see how satisfied they are with the product and how they actually use it. It's a more of a toy of very limited use than something really practical."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I'm not a tech guy. In fact, I generally loathe having to deal with computers and technology. Unfortunatly, since I own my own business I spend a large part of my day sending e-mails, processing orders, and doing book keeping, so much of my day is spent interacting with technology. I also spend a good portion of my day on the road, and until recently I had to lug my laptop around. Whenever I found down time, wherever I was, I'd have to bring it out, wait for it to boot up, log on to the internet, get my work done, then wait for it to shut down. It got the job done, but it was heavy and awkward to carry around, and uncomfortable to use in the car.\n\nI'd been considering switching to a tablet for a long time, and when I finally decided to go ahead and make the switch I researched every tab on the market. I spent a lot of time testing tabs at the electronics stores. Some just weren't very intuitive, and getting them to perform required more effort than I was willing to invest. Some were choppy. Some seemed to crash every 5 minutes.\n\nThe one that always operated beautifully was the Ipad 2. Unfortunately, my business requires that I watch videos my clients send me, and the lack of flash support worried me. Ultimately I decided I could use the Ipad on the road and watch whatever videos I couldn't get to play when I got home to my computer.\n\nSet up was very easy - and I'm not the most computer literate guy. Downloaded Itunes, plugged the Ipad in, and it was up and running. Within an hour the lack of flash support became annoying... Then I did a bit of research and found an App for $4.99 that allowed me to view flash on my Ipad flawlessly! The Ipads one limitation was solved for less than $5.00! Now I have Apps that simplify every element of my business. Maps, record keeping, creating documents...\n\nThe Ipad is wonderful to travel with. Day to day, on the road locally, it is light and slim, easy to take with my wherever I go. When I need to access records or check my e-mail I no longer have to wait for my laptop to boot up, with the touch of a button my Ipad is up and running, and on the internet moments later.\n\nThe battery life is stunning... It keeps me entertained and/or productive on long flights, and in hotel rooms in unfamiliar cities.\n\nI very rarely use my laptop since I got my Ipad. My Ipad does everything my laptop did for me, only it usually does it faster and easier. In fact, the main thing I wish I could change about the Ipad is the fact that it needs a computer to sync with (though it only needs to do this very rarely)... I wish it were a completely independant device so I could just set my laptop aside completely and let it gather dust.\n\nThe Ipad isn't 100% perfect. The camera isn't impressive at all. Watching flash requires downloading and using a seperate web browser app (I generally use Safari, overall its a better browser than the flash enabled one. When I run into a flash issue, I copy the address, open the Photon app and paste the address there) It's slightly annoying to have to take the extra steps, but it's not a huge issue.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with it!"}

Nobody uses Java anymore. It's this big heavyweight ball and chain.\"\nWhat is interesting to know is that Android phones and tables are running mostly Java applications... so Java is really not dead, but Apple is pretending to ignore the competition like they did in the 90's and think that Microsoft Windows was only a passing fad..."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I was given an iPad 2 for Mother's Day this year and it is truly one of the best gifts I've ever received! I have a large family, and every person here uses the iPad on a regular basis. It's been in use for the last 5+ months from morning until night and I am still delighted and amazed with it.\n\nI'd never personally owned a tablet before, or an Apple product, but we have multiple computers and all manner of electronic devices in our home and most people would consider me and my family to be techies. Because we have laptops and desktops and netbooks and smart phones, I didn't think that a tablet would particularly add to our level of connectivity or productivity. I was so wrong.\n\nUpon opening my iPad2, I was instantly struck by its thinness and its simplicity. There was just the tablet and a charger and a small, welcome pamphlet. I turned it on and it gracefully guided me through setting up my wireless connection. It offered me a tutorial, but I was too excited to bother with that. I was surfing the net within seconds because the interface is so intuitive.\n\nBy now, there are loads of reviews that go into detail about the cameras and other hardware featured on the iPad2 so rather than bore you, I will focus on some of the real world ways this tablet has changed the way we do things in my home.\n\nAs a homeschooling mother of a 9 year old, this tablet has made the best things about learning at home even better! The battery life is so good that we keep it with us all over the house. No need to worry about being near a power supply or booting up time or any of that. The iPad 2 is always connected, always ready. There are literally thousands of amazing apps, many of them free, that enrich my child's learning day. He is working on improving his handwriting and using an app that lets him write right on the screen! If he makes a mistake, it prompts him to try again until he gets the hang of it. Math, reading, journaling, science, anatomy, astronomy, geography, music - there's an app for that!\n\nHaving the iPad2 has meant that whenever my son wonders about something or asks a question about something, we have the answers right in our hands. Remember when you didn't know how to spell a word or a definition in school? Remember how the teacher told you to go look it up? This is like that, only a thousand times better because there is no walk of shame past the whole class to the big dictionary. My son looks up things all day long just because he WANTS to!\n\nThere are several exceptional music programs that feature an electronic keyboard. My favorite cost a couple of dollars and my boy is now playing music. It translates well, too, because I have a piano and he is able to play tunes he learned on the iPad on our full size piano.\n\nOf course, there are games, too. Lots of them. This has been a real boon when we go on road trips. Even though there is no wi-fi in the car, my son has loads of apps to keep him entertained until we reach our destination. No more asking \"are we there yet\"?\n\nI have a 15 month old granddaughter who is becoming very iPad saavy, too. It amazed me that even a young toddler quickly grasps the concept of icons and different apps doing different things. She actually knows how to turn it on and choose the correct folder to find the Fruit Ninja app and successfully launch it and play! There are several other games she enjoys, as well as some delightful alphabet games and story book apps. She also enjoys having us take video of her with the iPad and then play it back for her.\n\nI generally have it with me in the kitchen at meal times because I can look up a recipe and have it in front of me while cooking. Or I can watch a movie with the Netflix app while baking or preparing more complicated meals. If I didn't have a Kindle already, I would be using the Kindle app to read ebooks, too. Thanksgiving won't be nearly as tedious for me this year because of my iPad.\n\nI now take it with me when I travel instead of my laptop because it fits in my purse! I got a bluetooth keyboard to go with it so even when I need to type a lot, it's no problem (although the virtual keyboard is responsive and quicker to type on than you might think). I spent several days at a hospital with a friend and the iPad allowed us both to keep up with email, google for further medical info, and even watch a movie. I've discovered that there is wi-fi almost everywhere! (That's good because I didn't choose the 3G version.) My friend was so impressed that she bought an iPad as soon as she got home!\n\nEven though the device is almost fantastically thin and elegant, I would caution you to purchase and use a case all the time with your iPad. The screen is plenty tough but I have read many, many warnings about dropping it on one of it's corners, which results in the screen shattering. A case is good insurance and many of them feature the magnetic on/off, which conserves battery charge while protecting your iPad when you aren't using it.\n\nOther nice, but not essential, accessories are a protective screen film, a capacitive-style stylus, and an extra charger/car adapter. If you will be using your iPad as a replacement for a notebook on a regular basis, a wireless, bluetooth keyboard is nice, too. But other than a good case, the iPad2 needs nothing else to be up and running straight out of the box.\n\nHighly, highly recommended."}

During online chat the chat window from agent disappeared when I started typing.\n\nMaking corrections to this review I can't scroll down to information I already typed.  No arrow keys,  had to preview then edit, the hit return then delete returns.\n\nHard to place cursor between letters even using a stylus\n\nIn app store some games say they are free but eventually you must buy to continue.  Many of the thousands of apps are games and not many useful apps for business.\n\nHard to scroll in form (like this on).  Every time I try to place the cursor I get a pop to cut, copy etc\n\nReading books hard because thumb placement on device can inadvertently turn pages or other thumb can take you out of book and to the desktop. Also must hold iPad to read comfortably.\n\nBattery life is okay but I expected more (been using for 2 hours am down to 63% from fully charged, now down to 54%\n\nYou need a computer as you have to sync with iTunes.  Also, have not found a way to delete apps off iPad without iTunes\n\nNo USB ports, memory not expandable\n\nLarge for everyday use and since back is so slippery is hard to hold securely unless you have a case.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe more I use it the less I like it.\n\nThis doesn't do much more than a Palm Pilot and the palm can fit easily in your pocket or purse, has onscreen keyboard, graffiti, wifi, sd slot, Bluetooth, real word and excel software, email, built-in calculator, eReader, music, etc.  Too bad they are no longer available except on eBay.\n\nHowever, if you want a 10\" screen then a netbook is much more useful.  A real OS, flash support, large hard drive, screen can be adjusted for optimal viewing, USB ports, and the list goes on.  Portability is not much different and you can get a lot more for your money.  Price is another plus.\n\nI would never have bought this for myself.  As I finish this the battery is at 56%.  Typing this has been tedious and draining."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I wanted to focus a bit on just one thing I love about tablets. They provide you a very portable second screen. I happened to pick the iPad 2 after a lot of research with other tablets.\n\nI am away from home a lot during the day for work and class and also at night as I study. As a college student and future programmer I love having the iPad as a second screen. I can have my Kindle and PDF textbooks, web tutorials or HTML help apps open on the iPad as I type notes and program on my laptop. I am not constantly having to minimize or switch between windows on my laptop screen, which is pretty nice. I can also have Netflix, the ABC app or Hulu playing as I do homework. The small size of the iPad allows for me to slip it right into the same case as my laptop, awesome! They have some laptops now that have a pull out second screen but it seems to be an expensive option that leaves no other features like the iPad (or another tablet) does.\n\niPads also have a lot of other fun features besides providing you with more screen real-estate when you aren't doing homework or programming!\n\nThe End\n\n*I am a fan of Apple, have been since the early 90's when in 1st grade I was blown away by the amazing Oregon Trail (yes I know it was MECC software) on the IIGS in all it's green glory. I now own many Apple products. I am also a fan of Microsoft, work on Win XP and 7 at work everyday and have no issues with Windows. I also play pretty hard on the Xbox 360 in my down time. I use Google's services across multiple platforms. I run Win7 and OSX on my Apple laptop. I run Linux, although not as much as the other operating systems."}

Points to consider:\n- I thought I'd put my digital pics on the Ipad, but there is no port, so I can't hook my camera up to it.\n- The picture quality of pictures taken with the Ipad was TERRIBLE.\n-I would love to have internet access anywhere but the Ipad is too bulky to carry around (and do I really want 24/7 access to email and internet anyway?).\n-Watching a movie is uncomfortable, as I'd have to hold the Ipod in my hand in order to see the screen well enough.  -No need to have Itunes on the Ipad as I can't exactly jog with it and the speakers are WEAK.\n-The keyboard was surprisingly easy to use, but not as fast a a regular.\n- I'd have to buy a case, a stand, and a screen protector if I wanted to carry it around regularly.\n-I realize a lot of these issues could be solved in one way or another, but I just don't have the time to figure it all out.  I am quite happy sitting with my Macbook, with a keyboard, a cd/dvd disk drive, a an firewire and usb port!\n\n I would not suggest the Ipad, especially if you already own other Mac products."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I recently received the Apple iPod 2 as a birthday gift. Since I never had the iPad 1 I'm still learning how to use it, although it is somewhat similar to my 3rd generation iPod touch. The iPad 2 has a lot of nice features built in such as a video/picture camera and FaceTime. What I really don't like about my iPad is that I can't download Adobe or watch shows on Hulu or any other website without paying fees. These are things that I can do on my regular laptop at no extra cost. Apple is forcing the iPad purchasers to use iTunes or to pay extra fees elsewhere. If I had known this from the start I would have returned the iPad and bought a tablet. If you don't like watching videos online or you don't mind paying extra fees then the iPad is great. As for me I am not happy with it.\n\nUpdate 12/28/11: iPad now offers Apps for ABC and TV.com for CBS so I can watch shows from these networks for free and I don't have to purchase them from iTunes. The iPad is still restrictive compared to some tablets, but I'm going to change my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars. iPad is equal or superior to most tablets currently on the market, but I just wish that it wasn't so restrictive in some cases."}

Who needs an iPad when you have a desktop, an iPhone, and a laptop? An iPad would be a total waste of money, right? Well, now I finally have an iPad 2, and OH MY GOODNESS, HOW DID I LIVE WITHOUT IT ALL THIS TIME?!?!?\n\nThe iPad is amazing. You are all familiar with the impressive  technical details, I'm sure. Incredibly thin. Unbelievably lightweight. Spectacularly clear screen. Amazing battery life. The list goes on and on. However, the product description doesn't tell you how the iPad will change your life. Seriously, it has changed mine. I have no need to drag a heavy laptop around now that I have my iPad. As someone who rarely uses word processing programs anymore, the iPad has rendered my laptop practically useless. It also has some awesome word processing apps, so if I do need to type something, I can do so with ease, even using a touch screen. It's so nice to be able to pull this out of my bag and have instant Internet access with an amazing screen wherever I am. I have the 32GB version with wi-fi, and have plenty of space to store movies, music, apps, whatever. My iPad is with me wherever I go.

But really, it isn't the quick loading time, ease of multi-tasking, handsome hardware, beautiful resolution, or even cost that made us get this over other tablets.  It's the ability to have so many tens of thousands of applications.\n\nI use Kindle app, Moviefone, Scrabble, Netflix, and Groupon all the time.\n\nMy 3 year old uses Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, and wide variety of educational apps and games.\n\nMy 6 month old loves Itsy Bitsy Spider and other children's apps with music and interactivity.

I recommend, however, if you've never used an iPad, or for that matter, any Apple hardware device, you go to Apple.com and download the user manual. Apple's intellectual property security fetish is problematic if you have info on more than one laptop(s) or desktop(s) that you'd like to load on the iPad (music libraries especially). If you're a PC user, then the upload process for images is absolutely not straight forward. Copying photos takes some trial and a lot of error going from PC to iPad.

Also, it looks very sleek and modern.\n- The battery life is wonderful. I use my iPad 2 for hours on end and by the end of the day, there is still more than 50% battery.\n- Facetime is a great feature. My boyfriend and I Facetime daily and it's just like being there with him. Really cool and great for people who want to video chat with their family or friends.\n- Great resolution. Nearly every app and feature of this device is crystal clear. Better than an HDTV.\n- There are literally thousands of apps that one could download & lot of great free ones.\n- Very fast internet that NEVER freezes or force closes. Even the most detailed, memory eating web pages will load in a couple of seconds.\n- You could view many websites at once. With the iPad 2, you don't have to close your Yahoo! e-mail to access your Facebook. With this, you could open up several tabs to multitask.\n- Fast touch keyboard that is large enough to not make mistakes. I take my college notes on this daily and it's fast enough and easy enough to keep up with even the fastest-speaking prof.\n- Good memory space. I only got the 16GB and I'm very surprised at how much data it holds.\n\nCons\n- The camera is ABSOLUTELY horrible. When I went to take my first picture, I couldn't help but notice the graininess of the camera. So, if you're looking to purchase this & do a TON of photography, I wouldn't recommend it. It's worse than a 1990s digital camera. Less than one megapixel.\n- Sometimes the screen rotates without me flipping it. Not a huge deal but it could get annoying.\n\nAs you can see, the pros definitely outweigh the cons. Overall, it's a good device and a smart buy. You could practically use it anywhere and for nearly everything. Very glad that I purchased this."}

Here's what I use it for:  My email, both personal and work; reading Kindle and iBooks; reading the NY Times in the train, as well as checking about half a dozen other news sites for the latest information; reading magazines in their full-color glory (I recommend Zinio); watching movies and TV (Netflix streaming, Hulu Plus, ABC, You Tube and more -  it's been a godsend since last week's hurricane, which lunched my living room TV); participating in discussion forums and blogs; checking Facebook; shopping, shopping, shopping; checking weather; getting maps and navigation; having video chats with friends; using Skype for landline calls when I was in Spain and couldn't use my iPhone; playing with jigsaw puzzles, my favorite time suck.  There's much, more more, but I'd be here all night.\n\nI know that other Android-based tablets can do most of these things and can even do something's that iPad cannot.  But I love the look and feel of the iPad -  it feels very light in my hands, even with a leather cover.  And I love the incredible range of apps available from Apple.  Some Apple-haters would accuse me of \"drinking the Apple KoolAid\" and let them.  All I know is that this is the best piece of personal technology that has yet been invented."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "So, you're thinking of buying an iPad however, you're not so sure of what it can do and how it works. So, here is the \"Dummies Guide to the iPad\" to help you make that decision.\n\n\"I promise to keep the jargon down to a bare minimum\" :\n\nTo begin with the iPad must be paired to an existing Laptop or Desktop PC. These can be normal Microsoft Windows or Mac PC's. Once paired you can use the iPad by itself. It only has to be paired once. Although, there is a rumour that the next generation will work straight out of the box.\n\nYou will be able to:\n\n-Touch and pinch the screen to type words and move things around\n-Send and Receive Emails\n-Browse the Internet including Online Banking, Internet Shopping and more...\n-Listen to Music, including the Radio when there is a Wireless (Wi-Fi) connection\n-Watch Videos and Movies\n-Write and Print Letters (see the section on 'Printing' further down)\n-Download and Play Games\n-Become a Smarter Person (more on this later)\n-Display Pictures - it is an electronic Picture Frame too!\n-Take Pictures and Movies, if it has the onboard camera (iPad2 and newer)\n-Have a chat with the relatives abroad using Video Conferencing technology\n-Download THOUSANDS of books into a snazzy Book Reader that you can actually turn pages on the screen with\n-There are loads more - I'll leave them as a surprise if you decide to buy one :)\n\nYou will NOT be able to:\n\n-Watch a special type of animation or movie using a technology known as 'Flash' - don't worry about this though, you'll hear lots of people complaining about it. It really is no big deal and you'll learn to live without it. Over time, many of the popular web sites will move away from using Flash and use a newer technology that DOES work on iPads.\n-Insert a CD (there is no slot and you don't actually need one)\n-In fact, there is not much else you can't do with an iPad :\n\nTHE WIZARDS\n\nNo, not the ones' from Oz! Wizards are helpful programs that magically pop up and automatically configure things like the Internet and Email connections for you. The iPad has more Wizards than you can wave a wand at! When you first switch it on and whenever you need to set something up it will automatically present you with a Wizard. Therefore setting things up is as easy as 1-2-3.\n\nThe iPad is also an iPod!! - Loading music is done in one of two ways.\n\n1 - install the free version of iTunes onto your normal PC and follow the Wizards instructions to download your music from the 'iTunes Store' or transfer your music from your favourite CD collection. Then, connect the iPad to your computer using the supplied cable and it will automatically 'Synchronise' your music to the iPad. Yup, you guessed it - using yet another Wizard!\n\n2 - iTunes is a built in application (or App) on the iPad itself. Tap this App to search for and download your music directly to the iPad. You could even download a movie or your favourite episode of 24 too!\n\nOnce the music is on there just tap the iPod App to listen to it. Easy-Peasy!\n\nAPPS\n\nThe iPad extensively uses Apps. Apps are downloaded, using Wi-Fi. This is why you don't need a CD drive. These are the icons that are displayed on the screen.\n\nApps are downloaded from the Internet using yet another App called: \"The App Store\". Tap this icon to search for or see a list of the most popular Apps available, some are paid for and some are free! Tap the 'Install' button next to the one you'd like, follow the Wizards instructions and the App will automatically download and appear as a new icon on the screen.\n\nLOADING PICTURES\n\nThese can be loaded onto the iPad using iTunes, Email or the 'Camera Connection Kit' - this is a separate adaptor ($30) that plugs into the bottom of the iPad. Just insert the memory card from your camera into the adaptor and it will automatically load the pictures into the built in Photo App.\n\nTHE PICTURE FRAME\n\nWhen the iPad is locked (by pressing the button on the top-right side) and then back on again, you'll see a little icon in the lower right side corner of the display. Tap this and the Photo App will automatically display your pictures in full screen mode, converting the iPad into a digital Photo frame! It is a great feature. This means that you can leave the ipad on the shelf, literally as part of your rooms decor! You may want to purchase a 'Dock ($30)' to have the iPad tilted and supported at just the right angle.\n\nTip: if you need a reason to justify buying an iPad to your wife - use the Picture Frame one!!\n\nPRINTING\n\nPrinting is done wirelessly, however you MUST use one of the wireless printers detailed on the apple.com website. Typically, it will not print to anything other than one of those printers. There is one caveat to this statement, it is possible to print to any wireless printer if you pay for and download a third party App that is available via the App Store - use the search keywords 'wireless printing' to find it.\n\nIt is also possible to email whatever you'd like to print and pick it up on your normal PC for printing.\n\nFinally, I mentioned that you could become a Smarter Person by using an iPad - in fact this is not a joke. There are thousands of educational Apps including ones' for learning Astronomy through to learning how to read and play music and even Apps that will help you learn a new language. The possibilities are literally right at your finger tips!!\n\nIf you're unsure of which size to buy just buy the largest one you can afford. I have a 32GB version and have only used half of its capacity even with some very large Apps installed.\n\nThe iPad is many things to many people and the information above is just scratching the surface.\n\n\"I hope this review helps you make the right decision and I also hope that I did not use too much confusing jargon.\"\n\nGood luck!\n\n*** update 12th October 2011 ***\n\nApple have released their new Operating System (iOS 5)\n\nAmongst many new and enhanced features there is now the ability to synchronise data across multiple Devices. They call it 'iCloud' - think of iCloud as 'Virtual Filing Cabinet' to store your Documents, Diary and a record of your downloaded media from iTunes. Always accessible as long as there is an internet connection.\n\niCloud also allows the iPad to be used without having to 'Pair' it with a computer. It will now work straight out of the box!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I'm a developer and Android fan who also happens to have and Android phone which I love. So I was looking for the same experience in a tablet, and mostly because of Android being open and the fact that I may be able to apply custom roms, etc. After researching a lot, months ago I found the Androids tablet to be superior, or so I thought, to the iPad. Thats because I compared the hardware specs, usb support, etc. So I bought an Archos tablet first and then a GTab. But to be honest, the experience was never fluid or at least not near to what I was used in my phone. The UI is very laggy and there are too many bugs still. After a while I couldn't stand it anymore and I sold them. I think the problem is the software, Android, which is evolving and is still not ready for primetime, though I do think it will be sometime given the currnt trend.\n\nSo I decided to give the iPad a try. And it was worth it. The experience of this product is amazing, everything is crisp and fluid, even with less hardware than the Android ones. There's just no way to compare the OS in this regard. The iPad offers the best experience for a tablet today. If you don't believe me go and try one for at least 30 mins. I know that Apple is closed and all of those things I also hate, but still, the experience of using this device is so amazing it outweights other purely inellectual aspects, at least for me it does.\n\nIf you want a tablet that is fluid, reliable and just works, buy the iPad. Even the iPad 1 will do. If you want to play with roms and don't mind the bugs and UI freezes and basically don't mind spending time debugging usability issues, buy and Android tablet for the nice things like USB integration and openess.\n\nFor now I'll stick to Android for phones and to Apple for tablets. Let's see what happens a year from now.\n\nHope this review helps."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "BUYER BEWARE - IPADS ARE DISPOSABLE ELECTRONICS. My Ipad broke so I took it to an Apple store, but THEY WILL NOT FIX IT. Instead Apple will give you a refurbished Ipad if your warranty is still in effect. If your warranty has expired then your only option may be to throw your Ipad away. This means that after 13 months (unless you pay for an extra year of warranty then it will be 25 months) you could be flushing $500-$800 down the toilette. Even worse, if you are still under a warranty then Apple will give you a refurbished Ipad which could have 2-3 year old parts in it. An Applette at an Apple store told me that any broken Ipads are sent back to the factory where the unbroken parts are recycled into other Ipads. In other words, if you have a 6 month old Ipad that breaks, you could get a replacement that is already 2 years old. These disposal electronics only have a 3-5 year lifespan and `refurbished' has a reputation of lasting 1 month past the end of the warranty period or 6 months, whichever is a shorter period. If you are one of those that just has to have an Ipad then buy the cheapest one, otherwise buy the competitors for  to  the price of an Ipad. BTW, Apple might use old Ipad 1 parts in a refurbished Ipad 2."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "iPad2 64G wifi model\n\nPros: Very good image, light, small, great battery life, almost the 10hrs they claim, not just 3-4. Great for games, internet, books. Contains a standard iPod in it which is nice. Screen is sturdy enough to handle the constant cleaning/wiping you have to do without scratching.\nCons: Locks/apps freeze up regularly, needs a power off recycle to fix. Very poor wifi, constantly disconnecting regardless of wifi source, have tried many locations. With button on top, volume button is backwards, right is lower volume, left is higher which is opposite of the scale that pops up to show the volume level.\n\nOverall I spend more time getting it to work correctly than I do using it. It reminds of a circa 80s PC, maybe Windows 3.0 era. It is great for games, books, iPod because they are all internal. If it has to go externally to stream content, or send a message, etc that is when the problems develop.\n\nPeople complain constantly that it does not have a USB port. This is good because endless problems would develop from the use of endless attached devices, just like on PCs. Apple wants it closed for a reason, so it will work.\n\nBottom line, it is a toy, great for games, music and not nearly reliable enough to use for anything more important or demanding real time continuous stability."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Just bought a brand new 16GB iPad2 off Craigslist, and have some general comments...\n\nI found it quite difficult to get set up, it seems you have to connect the iPad to a PC or Mac and go from there (you get no manual, just a stupid little card with minimal info on it), which meant lots of figuring things out. Just the iTunes image alone that first appears on the screen when turning it on for the first time makes you go \"huh?\"  Maybe the Jr. High kids can blast through it, but it's harder for me (I'm 52) and I have a fair amount of computer experience.\n\nYou also have to input your credit card info! This means one thing...this machine is designed purposely to be a money hog for Apple and entertainment giants. It will have you buying all kinds of apps and music and entertainment to download from iTunes. Another step closer to being an automaton.\n\nNo USB port means Apple wants to control accessories and what you can input/output with the iPad, and that leaves you guessing, finding workarounds, and buying more stuff. But sure, it's also to minimize complications with external devices.\n\nThis machine is amazing, though, I got it for showing my work and upcoming interactive apps at conventions (I'm an artist). I can now carry around a portfolio of my work without the bulk. But to get photos on it properly you will have to buy an application for it. There are ways of getting photos uploaded without iTunes and buying photo apps (like emailing them to yourself and downloading them from there), but then the photo app it comes with leaves you without much capability to manipulate and organize them and put them in folders. There are literally no buttons/selections to control things with. This is obviously another manipulation to make you buy something more.\n\nLastly, if you want accessories (or even the iPad itself), go to Amazon or Craigslist, Ebay, friends, family--and buy them used, don't fork out $50 for a new protective cover, you can find a lot of these things used or cheaper than buying from Apple or manufacturers that don't care about the Earth and design products that end up too soon in the landfill.\n\nOverall it's a cool machine, but like me, with the way corporations/manufacturers plan and manipulate your pocketbook you might one day start to realize you're just a cog in the money machine for these corporate entities.\n\nWell, someone had to say it."}

So, the verdict is in:\n\nI put it in a black leather case and deliver sermons from it every week (written on a Mac and transferred to the iPad by \"Print to PDF\" at A5 size straight to a Dropbox folder, then transferred on the iPad from Dropbox to iBooks. It takes about 20 seconds). I prefer the iPad to printed sermon notes and wedding outlines because it's more easily hand-holdable, I can use a custom color scheme at no extra charge for ink, the print can be very large, I'm not wasting a bunch of paper, it's lighter, smaller, and more portable than a large-print Bible, and when talking to people after church I've got access to my calendar and address book so I can schedule appointments, get contact information, write reminders for that week's staff meeting, etc., -- all while standing in the foyer greeting members and visitors.\n\nI've also used it for presentations by connecting it to a vga projector input at the podium and utilizing the mirrored display. You aren't limited to Keynote for that although it does work well. But I've found it just as useful with iBooks, Bible software, and even YouTube player. The portability is fantastic -- disconnect the video adapter, slap the cover closed and walk away.\n\nDaily uses: mileage and expense tracking, keeping track of contacts, calendars & notes, video record-keeping, listening to Texas Rangers baseball broadcasts, web surfing, investment management, reading papers and books, and navigation. It's my favorite device for reading and responding to most emails.\n\nIt can stand in for a computer in a pinch, which it had to recently when my laptop was put out of commission for a few days by a lightning strike. Using various apps most of the data I need on a daily basis is automatically synced wirelessly between the iPad, iPhone, and MBAir, so I still had my complete calendar and all my appointments (iCal/Google combo), access to all my email (IMAP gmail), all my notes (Evernote), vital documents (Dropbox), and the ability to research and write sermons, articles, and class presentations. It's capable enough that I can get by with leaving my laptop at the office most evenings. Yea!\n\nIt's far more portable than even my MacBook Air. It's small and discrete enough to take into restaurants, tuck into the console in my car, and take into hospital waiting rooms without appearing insensitive to anxious family members. Instant on and off means you can pick it up to glance at the weather radar, or check an address, or take a note as easily as picking up an iPhone, but the size makes it much faster and easier to enter and view information. It's also large enough to share information with others around you.\n\nI use it daily and would replace it within a week if I lost it. 5 stars."}

It was new, flashy, fast, the charge lasted forever and all my friends wanted to play with it. After about a week or two, the battery didn't seem to stay charged as long. It wasn't that big of a problem though, because I was never far from a plug. When I got to Afghanistan is when I lost all respect for the iPad 2. The lack of constant signal caused apps and updates to half download which left permanent gliches in the programs and the main screen as well, that I cannot get rid of. Problems, that none of my friends with other brand's tablets had. The battery life was almost cut in half and its a hassle to do anything with it now because of the poor state of apps and the whole iPad itself. I would recommend this if you will always have perfect signal and never be more than 10 feet away from a plug."}

For reading books the Kindle is way better. It's the perfect device for casual surfing. Casual fit's the device the best. If you like to read rather get a Kindle. When it's about work a PC or Mac is the better choice. The iPad kind of fill's the gap, if you already own any of the above devices, then it's often more convenient to use the iPad.

Sure this one may not be the one with the most options, but it surely is one of the most attractive and functional platforms for the general population.  What it does, for what it's meant to do, it does outstandingly.  It is probably by these reasons it is so popular and has so much competition at the same time.\n\nThis is the comparison table from my point of view. I hope it helps:\n\nPROs:\n1) Its simple and intuitive interface.  Nothing else is simpler to use.  It is \"kid-and-grandma's friendly\".\n2) Its responsiveness.  I have yet to interacted with a touch device that reacts to input this quickly.\n3) Its weight, very lightweight for its size.\n4) Availability of applications.\n\nCONs:\n1) Memory management.  With multitasking, it may sometimes be difficult to clearly identify what processes are running and how much memory is being used.  This may be a problem for some people.\n2) Screen resolution.  It is good, but definitely has room for improvement.\n3) Sound speaker at the back.  It would be so nice to have a speaker at the front, like the camera.

Its not happening, functions are too poor, touch screen keyboard is not tactile enough to use for any real typing, Safari browser is cumbersome to use, can't read the screen in even normal daylight so doesn't replace my e reader at all. No real spreadsheet functions or presentation modes. Too clumsy to take noes on.  The only things it replaces laptop for are movies or videos and even then the battery life is pretty poor.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I love it but it has some annoying downfalls.  These include the lack of Flash Player and the limited ability to print.  The lack of Flash is really a problem because there are still many sites that use Flash technology. Really, really annoying.\nAlthough printing is only possible with a select few Canon printers, I am not going out of my way to purchase a Canon printer just so I can print from my iPad.\n\nThe GOOD stuff:\nThe really great thing about this device is when you turn it on, Bam!  It's on.  No wait time, no boot up time.\n\niPad vs Kindle.\nInitially I bought the iPad as an e-reader because the experience is much superior when compared to the Kindle.  The touch screen is much more book like, turning pages with your finger is much more intuitive than pushing a button.  The scrubber at the bottom of the page so you can slide to any page, where as the Kindle you have to push a button or use the \"go to\" function and type in the desired page.  iPad lets you know what page and chapter name you're on rather than just a percent, the Kindle gives no chapter name or page number.  Every issue the Kindle has is addressed with the iPad.  The color screen is much better than the Kindle e-ink screen.\n***********************\n3G and GPS Chip.\nI am very glad I have these options.  When ever you want access the internet in remote areas via 3G, just go the \"settings\", cellular data and log in and turn on that option.  So for the next 30 days at $15 you have internet access.\nThe GPS chip is included with the 3G.  There are GPS apps for free, Waze and Motion X GPS Drive for purchase.  With the 3G option you need to turn on the Cellular Data in order for the GPS to work.\n\nWaze app is free and is pretty accurate but it did give me incorrect directions but it can only get better since the information is user generated.  Just driving around with Waze turned on generates information for other drivers.  It has voice guidance but does not give specific street names.  It is good in showing road conditions, traffic, hazards, etc....\n\nMotion X Drive app is 99 cents and just as good or better than Garmin.  It has many options and gives two different female voices for guidance, nothing really sexy.  It also states the street names but must be purchased for either $3 for 30 days or $20 for one year.  It also gives road conditions but Waze probably does a better job.\n***********************\nFaceTime\nThe Jetsons technology is here.  Works well enough but video can be a little choppy at times however I can't complain about the FREE video phone calls."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "First I'm not an Apple hater. I returned the product for several reasons I felt to be valid:\n\n<1.>  It's still too heavy and it's not very ergonomic. This product is not comfortable for me to hold for long periods. I would say I'm of average strength (I can do 10 overhand pull-ups). I didn't purchase it to prop it up on a desk. I can use a laptop for that. The 10\" Android tablets I've held are too heavy too. I think I might be happier with a 7\" tablet.\n\n<2.>  A certain social networking app I use on the iPod all the time stinks on the iPad. I don't know why they couldn't come up with something better than: A. Open it iPhone size. B. Stretch it with a nasty 2x zoom that really displays poorly.\n\n<3.>  There are a ton of iPhone apps, not so much for the iPad. And the aforementioned problem keeps me from wanting to run iPhone apps on the pad. I don't want to have to fight with jail-breaking the device just to run an app full-screen. There do seem to be plenty of games, but I didn't get it for that.\n\n<4.>  It doesn't even include a calculator. Sure you can download a calculator from the app store. With the added bonus of a big iAd in the middle of the screen. I didn't know I was getting a $600 iPad with Special Offers.\n\nIn short I would not purchase this product without planning to jail-break it. If you do that I hear of all sorts of trouble with upgrades and, of course, no Apple support. The bright spot, the electronics store I purchased from let me return it without even charging me a restocking fee."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "When choosing which capacity iPad to buy, you should be aware of the following:\n\nFor many users, this 16GB iPad will be a great choice because, although you cannot expand its capacity, you can import files \"on-the-go\" with the following Apple accessory: the Apple Camera Connection Kit\n\nYou can use the Apple Camera Connection Kit (the SD card reader part) to import media files directly into your iPad, without the need to sync to iTunes.\n\nThis means you can bring along with you an almost unlimited number of media files, such as movies, mp3's, and photos.\n\nPerfect for a long trip, etc. Why not take along 100 GB or more? Fantastic!\n\nThere are a few details you need to know to import media files this way.\n\n1). Create a folder on any SD card and name that folder \"DCIM\".\n\n2). Place media files into the DCIM folder.\n\n3). Important: The media file names have to be exactly 8 characters long (no more, no less), or the iPad will not see them.\n\nExamples: 8letters.mp3, 8numbers.jpg, 8Numbers.mp4, TheBirds.mp4, Img_9001.bmp.\n\nThose are really the main details, but here are a few more:\n\nWhen you insert the Card Reader (one of two devices in the kit) into the iPad, with an SD card in it, in a moment the iPad screen will show thumbnails of all the media files on the card.\n\nYou can import some or all into the iPad. You cannot play media files from the card, you must first import them. To select some media files, just touch them to highlight them and choose \"Import\". Or, you can select \"Import All\".\n\nThe iPad will ask if you want to Keep or Delete (on the card). Be careful to select Keep (in most cases).\n\nValid video files need to be in the \".MP4\" format, version H.264. Or convert them to that format using almost any conversion program. I chose a size of 640 x 480, and it was perfect for filling up the screen.\n\nNOTE: the media files are imported into the \"Photo\" section of your iPad. Even the MP3's and Videos. So, to watch a movie, for example, select the Photo icon, not the Video icon on your screen (it won't be in the Video section).\n\nAND, you can delete any media files after playing them. That way, you can, for example, load a movie or two into the iPad, watch, then delete to make room for others."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "First, let me explain the 4 stars instead of five. I find the ipad too heavy to hold when reading. Perhaps that can't be helped. It certainly is not heavy in the real sense of the word. It's easy to carry with you anywhere. But to hold it upright for long periods like you do the Kindle is not what it was made for. So, I read my books on the Kindle.\n\nThat aside, I used to think the iPad was an expensive toy. I was wrong. I use it for my business and investments and have yet to play a game on it. I get streaming quotes and financial news and instant updates. Apple has so many apps that you'll find exactly what you want. I have lots of fitness and exercise apps that help me keep my health in check.\n\nLots of people have written in-depth reviews on the iPad and I'm not going to try and do the same thing. I merely want to say that this is a powerful device that can put power in your hands and add a lot to your business and personal life.\n\nApple support is decent but you can't get refunds for apps you don't like or that don't work for you. That's a major con and very much unlike Amazon. Also, Apple's site --- iTunes --- is hard to navigate. But those are the only cons I've found thus far.\n\nA word of advice: While 16gb is a considerable amount of space for books, etc, you may regret not getting more memory. I do. Just the apps alone (if you buy a lot of them as I did and most people do) take up lots of space. And video uses lots of memory. I didn't think I'd keep many videos on my iPad but I do. I'm now using about three-forths of my memory and I've only had the device about a month or less. I can assure you that next time I'll spend a bit more and buy more memory and you might want to consider that as well.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n- Susanna K. Hutcheson"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "It was with sadness that I returned it - felt like I was returning the Future. But here's why:\n1) It was too heavy for me to rest comfortably on lap while lying down.\n2) I had to purchase GoodReader to see if that would work for the main reason I wanted an ipad2 (to dowload and read academic pdfs from a certain website and zip files from another speciality website). I should have done this to see if it was compatable, but by the time I figured this out I had already invested so much time getting this to work right and had had enuf.\n3) Similarly, i would have to purchase a stylus to see if I could find one that worked for me. I'm used to using wrist movments and finger movements to work for long periods of time - not upper arm movements - so I would have to use a stylus. was not prepared cause I thought my styluses I already have would work on the IPAD\n4) Worst onscreen keyboard I have ever used. You have to hit a seperate key to make numbers and symbols like @ appear, and then hit the key again to return to letters. Perhaps i'd get used to this, perhaps not. so for, not.\n5) Similarly, if you can't touch type with the keyboard (you can't, I tried) then why space them out so far from one another? or why not let it be modifyable depending on the needs of the user?\n6) in the app store the print is too tiny. Much to my surprise, I could not expand it in the usual way. I did not bother to see if there was another way to expand it\n7) there's something dizzying about the way it switches between screens.\n8) Apple's official position is that they will not support WIFI conncections that use the older WEP security. Their only advice is to upgrade to WPA which they are happy to help you with excpet they don't care about the problem that then my older two devices would not be able to connect...So if have intermittant trouple with wifi because of WEP, don't count on Apples help. It took me ages to access some firmware to upgrade, only to find that i can't use WPA.\n9)In the store, the Ipad I tried got so dim as to be practically black. that's what I want for the dim lighting i use it in. My unit does not get as dim as that one. It's probably ok though.\n10) The final straw was an irrational one I guess...I decided to take a break from figuring things out and watch some stuff from NBC. I had not realized NBC does not support IPAD. the shows are on hulu but why shyould I pay 8 bucks a month when I can watch for free on my laptop. Other people have commented that they are going to start watching more ABC. I would rather find a table that lets me watch what I want.\n11)and ok, one more, i would also like to upload files to a speciality website, but didn't check to see if there's an app for that...\n12) I hate all the going thru ITUNES, a behmoth that now sits on my laptop, though i'd probably get used to this.\n\nOverall, Apple is really great at creating problems and then offering to sell you an App for that (no usb, no Word, no excel, can't upload or download files etc.). This is great if your main purpose is to show things to people. Big screen and without a cumbersome keyboard in the way.\n\nI might try and IPOD touch. same idea, but lighter. so now i'd still have to get goodreader and try again..."}

PC's all my life and i knew nothing about apple products except that they were expensive and the most pretentious people liked them. and i stand by that.\n\nwell.....lets just say that the iPad 2 is just a amazing little machine. it took me awhile to figure out the whole system...it is different from a PC and not google-based. it is a transition...\n\nif your like me i can tell you honestly its a transition you would do well for yourself by taking.\n\ni am gonna compare the Xoom to the iPad 2 because it might be helpful and when i made my purchase i noticed alot of reviewers did the same...\n\n1- looks. iPad.its stunning. absolutely gorgeous. its art. no doubt. the Xoom is cool indeed, but the iPad has it hands down. don't mind paying more for that at all. you live once.\n\n2- speed. its incredibly fast. insane. and gotta give it up to the Xoom too...when it was running at full speed it was incredible too. both equal in my opinion.\n\n3- ease of use. Xoom has it all over the iPad 2. coming from PC's its a seamless transfer. google-based. tabs. etc...no worries. the iPad is completely new so the challenge is teaching yourself...BUT once you learn the way...MY GOD IT IS AWESOME.\n\n4- accessories and apps. iPad. all the way. no doubt. none. the apps are incredible. the accessories are ridiculously expensive for what they are but once you hold them...the quality is there. the Xoom has no real acessories to speak of..and the apps available are few and far between. that said...i didn't have any problem with normal use of the Xoom and i understand more are on the way...which is awesome.\n\n5- battery life. same. both rock. ten hours.\n\n6- screen. iPad 2. hands down. amazing and beautiful. the screen doesn't get nearly the amount of fingerprints as the xoom and the pictures are gorgeous. this is a non-issue. the iPad looks better in every way.\n\n7- ease of use. Xoom. really easy to use. intuitive.\n\n8- support. iPad. AppleCare is the best thing ever. ever. forget about it.\n\n9- photos. Xoom. the ability to store photos into catagories and switch them around is awesome. the iPad you just have one big place to put all of your pics.\n\nthat said 10- cameras. iPad.\n\n11 - cost. about the same. iPad maybe more with the applecare.\n\nand finally...\n\n12- set up. Xoom. all the way. plug it up and your good to go. the iPad you gotta sync with a PC and load up iTunes and jump a bunch of annoying hoops. that done though...MAN is it awesome.\n\nsooo....its a big purchase. i think both machines will do right by anyone. but if your looking for something artistic. dramatic. tough and secure go for the iPad. if your looking for something familar, comfortable and easy...the Xoom is for you.\n\nin conclusion....my iPad 2 is awesome. im glad i took the plunge and have no regrets. every day im loving it more and more...its amazing.\n\nim becoming pretentious now. i find myself silently judging others by their tablets and computers. i do and its awful. if you choose to get a iPad you will do the same thing. you need to be prepared for it....\n\nits a glorious feeling!!!!!

After trying many different tablets and reading many reviews and lastly just playing around with the iPad 2, I knew it was the best tablet on the market right now. Yes it does have many drawbacks if you compare it to the other tablets, but the it also has many great things about it and pros greatly outweigh the cons. Coming from an iPod touch i was already familiar with iOS. I also plan on getting an iPhone as my next smart phone. I prefer iOS over android and other operating systems for mobile devices. iOS just works and flows really well. Its really reliable and easy to use. Any body any age can pick an iOS device especially an iPad and just start using it right away, its just that easy. I do really wish the iPad 2 had flash but over time I got used to it. Also there are many work around for watching or using flash on the iPad 2. Their are at least 10 different apps/browsers that will allow you to use flash on your iPad 2. Also over time flash will die. It is a aging format, it drains too much battery and memory and its slow and most of all there's all sorts of security issues with it. I know since I use adobe flash on my htc desrie all the time. Also many websites, I would say as much as 75% of them offer 2 choices html 5 or flash versions of their website. I also wish the iPad 2 had a higher resolution screen. Many of the other android tablets do have a higher resolution. They also have better cameras, more ram and dual speakers. Regarding the screen I haven't noticed that the resolution is an issue right now any way all videos, web pages, apps and games look great on it. Also the speaker is gerat even though its just one on the bottom right, its still fairly loud and does the job. In terms of performance I don't find the iPad 2 slow in any way even though it has less ram than the other tablets on the market. Here is where the iPad 2 excels when compared to its competitors: The battery life is just crazy at 10 hours, yes at times I do wish the battery was removable so I could just swap another but its just really long lasting. The iPad 2 is supper light especially when compared to the other tablets or even the previous iPad. At first I found it a little on the heavy side and I do still wish it was a little bit lighter like around 1 pound, which Im sure the next will be. I think there is only one tablet which is lighter than the iPad 2 and that's the samsung galaxy tab 10.1. The iPad 2 has the best app store. It has the most apps, the best quality apps, and the developers make the apps for apple first before android, blackberry or windows 7 phone. Apple also has the largest store to purchase music, music videos, tv shows and movies. You can also rent movies on it. The iPad 2 has the best selection of games out of all the other tablets. Their are tons of games free and paid on the iPad 2. The iPad 2 just like any other product has huge number of third party accessories available for it. Apple has great customer service and a great warranty. I do have to warn you that when I received my iPad 2 in the first week of may. I had purchased it online from appples website and it was shipped to me in 3 weeks directly form the factory in china. I was aware that their maybe a backlight bleeding issue on some iPad 2s. It turns out mine had it and I wouldn't have known if I wasn't on the forums. I went into an apple store and the genius replaced it on the spot. Mind you I did get a refurbished model. But the refurbished replacement was flawless with no backlight bleeding and haven't had any issues with it yet. So I caution you to maybe wait until they say for sure that they have fixed the defect with all iPad 2s and then make the purchased. Or you can make your purchase now and see if you get a defective one or not. Overall I am very happy with my iPad 2. I do suggest going for highest memory option you can afford especially if your gonna use it for more than just browsing and email. The apps and games do add app and its always nice to have that extra storage available. Also if you can afford the extra $100 for the 3G connectivity I do suggest that also. That is one feature I wish I had got. I seem to use my iPad 2 mostly at home but when I'm out I do wish I have the 3G since I have to use my smartphone as a hotspot and use up its battery and data. If you get the one with 3G you can always just sign up for no contract data and just turn the plan on and off whenever you really need it with no commitments. Lastly, the iPad 2 does have the antenna gate issue which lowers the signal of the data connection of the device when holding it a certain way. I disappointed to hear this, but its seems these days almost any mobile device has some sort of issue like this. I have noticed it on my 2 ipod touchs and htc desire and now the iPad 2. It happens when you hold down on the speaker grill on the bottom left of the iPad 2. I have noticed it only drops the signal by one bar. So if I have 3 bars on wifi then it drops 2 bars. It there is only one bar then it doesn't drop the connection. I have also done a speed test and it slows down the speed by about one third. It never seems to affect streaming video or music for me. The iPad 2 is a great device I don't regret buying it all. I could just bought a cheap netbook but I a tablet. I was never even a fan of the iPad when it first came out, I thought it was just an over sized iPod touch which I already had. Also I was never a big follower of apple products, yes, I have owned a couple of iPod touchs but that's about it. I was also never a fan of the iPhone just found it over rated. But now after owning the iPad 2 for almost 3 months I can honestly say it is the coolest thing I have ever owned.\n\nDecember 2011 update: Well after owning the iPad 2 for about 7 months I can say its a great device but not good enough. The iOS 5 update made this worse in many ways especially battery life. The device is also more buggy now. Alot of the new features work but don't work right or all the time. I did update to 5.01 and battery life as improved but not to what it was before 5.0. I am anxiously awaiting a worthy tablet from google. The lack of flash, not having real multitasking, not being able to modify or customize my tablet in any way, not having micro sd card or usb ports really makes me wanna get an android based tablet. As soon as there is an android tablet that is just as good as the iPad 2 or better I will be getting it and selling this iPad 2. In the mean time I guess I will have to just deal with the limitations of an iOS device. Jailbreaking my iPad 2 did improve the usability of it alot but then I updated to iOS 5 and I no longer have a jailbreak. Jailbreaking still doesn't compare to the hack-ability and customization an android device is capable of especially if rooted.\n\nApril 2012 update: aftering owning my iPad 2 for almost a year now I am still very happy with it. When I first wrote my review I thought maybe the an android tablet would be better for me. Since then I tried the asus transformer prime and found out the grass is not greener on the other side. The asus prime was buggy, had all sort of glitches. I wasn't happy with the hardware or software especially after using an iPad. The lack of tablet specific apps was also very limited. The only thing I miss from the prime was the keyboard dock which provided extra battery life, extra ports and a hardware keyboard. There is still nothing like this for the iPad. All the keyboards are Bluetooth and end up draining the iPads battery quicker. There is the apple keyboard dock but only works in portrait mode and can only be used on desk or flat surface.\n\nThe iPad 2 is even better than before now since the price has been reduced to $400 and you can get a refurb unit for only $350. Personally I think the refurb should be $300. But $350 is still a great price and ofcourse people will still buy it at that price. I don't really see a point in upgrading to the newer iPad. I played around with it in the store and yes it did look better but only when you put the two of them next to each other. They say only people who use their iPad for videos and gaming will really benefit from the better screen. The newer screen is also suppose to reduce eye strain for reading.  The iPad is still the best tablet on the market and will continue to be so for a while at least until google finally gets their act together and produce a comparable tablet.  Androids lack of tablet apps and fragmentation is really killing and holding google back from competing with Apple."}

Just getting used to not having to use a mouse is incredible, and the weight saved versus carrying a laptop or even a netbook is awesome.  I travel alot, so this makes a big difference to me.  In addition, the ease with which it was purchased on Amazon versus trying to find one at a store, due to the short supply, was simply wonderful.  It arrived within 4 days, at a better price than in the stores.  All in all, a great purchase with which I am very satisfied."}

Very lightweight and sleek design.the cameras work extremely well in the light, in the dark it seems to be fuzzy. The other day there was a problem with the volume rocker and Apple did a very good job at helping me fix it. Now it works with ease. The battery is very very good it lasts 10+ hours sometimes if I use it correctly it will last days. This is the best tablet on the market. I'm actually writing the review on it now which brings me to the keyboard. It is very responsive and comfortable to type on. At first it is hard to type but once you get use to it you will type pretty fast. In fact I'm better at typing on this than on the computer. It is just so much easier.if you get this you will agree. The bad reviews are wrong. Those reviews were probably written by the companies with other tablets just trying to bring their tablet to the top and Apple's to the ground but it will NEVER HAPPEN. Apple is the best brand of technology out their. Don't hesitate to buy. They go very quick. Apple even shipped it quicker than 1 week. Than I got it in 1 week. Although I had to wait it was well worth it. I originally went with the xoom but it was to slow and was delayed. Plus the iOS software is just plain better and much simpler. The Apple iPad 2 is great for all people, chefs, business men and women, teachers,or even the stay at home mom. Always fun."}

Is there an astounding amount crammed into a small, considerably weight-reduced package? A resounding yes.  Are there some pretty impressive apps available for it?  Per this review's title, yes.  Is it a completely effective replacement for meaningful human contact?  No, but I'm reserving judgement for when generation 3 arrives with an optional mounting harness for love dolls.\n\nLook, its not perfect...realistically, it'll be a solid 4 or 5 years before a device in this price range can match the 160 gigs of an ipod classic with flash memory, and the dual core chip, while fine for day to day maneuvers, can lag in the more intensive tasks (not that there are many apps that convert things to DivX format or remotely control nuclear cooling towers).  Additionally, the lack of slots for SDHC or its 'micro' version knocks off a point or two for versatility.  Once data is on the thing, your only hope of exporting is via email or with third party software (and be REALLY careful to test it out with nothing crucial already installed, as there are some abysmal titles out there).  Also, I feel a decade of that proprietary cable is enough.\n\nGripes aside, this thing is a joy to use.  The battery is every bit as good as people claim, my average use per charge is right between 11 and 12 hours.  No screen protector was included, but aftermarket options are plentiful, and the matte finish option I tried produces an incredibly natural response, especially when using a stylus.  Need to entertain a child 1-3 years of age?  Furry Friend is a fantastic app, and less than 2 dollars in the full version.  Splashtop, though, is the primary component of the 5 stars.  Full version is fairly inexpensive (intermittently goes on sale for 1.99), and it has saved me both time AND monitor life; Splashtop is remote control for your PC or MAC...nothing new there, those in the IT world have been doing this for some time, and its one of the features advertised for Windows 7 in particular.  But the versatility is the selling point.  You could be stuck at an airport, and edit a slew of photographs, browse on Firefox with your home presets/favorites, access anything your home computer can access, all with intutitive touch controls.\n\nWith the sum of available science today, one could certainly design a device with more features and performance.  Sure it would cost a ridiculous sum, but ultimately, you get what you pay for.  I am a PC guy (only in computer preference), but I have to admit this is an impressive slab of glass and aluminum.  As for those claiming the purchase of an Apple product will designate you as a sheep or conformist, I applaud your staunch independence...just be sure you avoid any Meat, Fruits, Grains and Vegetables grown more than 50 miles from you, switch to a all-recycled burlap wardrobe, Handcraft your furniture from sustainably harvested logs downed with your own teeth, coat the whole thing with cruelty-free mud, and power your domicile with a small windmill and excercise bike hooked up to a homemade turbine.  Also, avoid all non-leg-based transportation.  Then you can be a true pioneer!"}

So I dumped the \"smart\" phone, reverted back to a \"dumb\" phone and got an ipad. I just love it! It's small and light - fits in most of my purses without a problem. I carry it around all the time - has my grocery list, my address book, photos of my grandchildren, my calendar, my favorite music, maps & GPS and links to my ebay auctions. It has Angry Birds to keep me amused while waiting at the doctor's offce. It has Pandora radio, which is AWESOME! It has a screen I can actually SEE and a keyboard I can actually USE! No more struggling trying to do things on that stupid \"smart\" phone. AND it never calls anyone by accident like the Droid used to do. A lot...\n\nI have a laptop at home for my business use, so I didn't expect it to be a substitute for that. But when I am shopping on ebay, it's much more pleasant to sit on the couch with my little ipad than to sit at the desk with the laptop.\n\nI find it works seamlessly with wi-fi and Verizon wireless. I got the $20/month 1 gig plan and it's plenty for me. I bought a docking station with speakers, so my stereo just became completely obsolete. The battery life is outstanding - especially when compared to my laptop.\n\nThe only thing I am not wild about is the Itunes interface. It has taken me quite a bit of fussing to master the art of getting stuff transferred over to the ipad.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The iPad2 64GB 3GS (\"iPad2\" in this review) really is a nice-to-have device.  For various reasons I did not have an original iPad despite wanting one, so this review will focus on the iPad2 and not the differences between the two generations.\n\n1.  Screen.  The Screen on the iPad2 is gorgeous.  HD movies really do look HD, and the iPad2 provides a very satisfactory viewing experience.\n\n2.  Battery life:  Very good.  Despite moderately heavy \"on the road\" use, I have never managed to run my battery even to 50%.  Others are reporting 11-12 hours and this is consistent with what I am seeing.  Apple did a good job with this battery, and the overall power management of the iPad2.  I have my screen set to auto-dim (where the screen adapts to the lighting in the room) and no doubt this helps.  I have never needed or wanted to fiddle with the screen using this setting.  Ordinary Apple chargers work fine to charge the iPad2 battery.  However, many computer USB ports do not have enough juice to charge the iPad2.  My main Windows computer does not; not even from a powered USB hub.  Many third-party chargers for the iPhone turn out not to work with the iPad2 although all of the Apple ones I have tried do, and some of the after-market ones do.  So far my experience has been that if they sold it in the Apple store, it works.\n\n3.  Browsing the web.  The iPad2 is peerless for just plain web browsing, and this is what it excels at.  The virtual keyboard is OK for short email messages or filling in fields on websites.  For more heavy duty typing, there are a number of fine outboard keyboards out there.  I was delighted to find that my Apple Bluetooth Keyboard works splendidly with the iPad2 and for road trips I pack it along.\n\n4.  Cameras.  There are two; front and back.  They are exactly what you would expect: OK for quick snapshots, but a lens a fraction of an inch in diameter is not going to take the place of a real camera; we all know that.  They work reasonably well for what they are.  I have not yet tried the various videophone applications so I cannot speak to that.\n\nThe iPad2 is thin and easy to carry.  The Apple case, which many people buy, is nice to have, but it does not protect the back of the iPad.  There are any number of aftermarket leather or other kinds of cases that provide the iPad2 with more protection.  Most of these will cause the iPad2 to power down when the front flap is closed, just as the Apple cover does.  This is a very nice feature.\n\nThe iPad2 has infinite professional and personal uses.  I can have it in the courtroom (I am an attorney) and look up cases on-line quickly and snappily using the 3GS, since most courtrooms do not provide counsel with Wi-Fi.  Email, Web access, etc., these things are all becoming a fundamental part of our lives.  I used to use my iPhone for portable Web access, and it was OK for that, but the iPad2 with its larger screen is infinitely better for this.  In my life Web access wherever I go is the main use for the iPad2, and it is a critical use.\n\nMy main negative on the iPad2 are these: 1.  No dedicated USB2 port.  Why not? 2.  The lack of a USB port makes it very difficult to print anything with the iPad2 and for some reason Apple does not make printing easy, or hardly even possible.  Apple flat-out does not encourage or want its iPad2 users to print off of their iPads.  Whether they are trying to protect their notebook sales or there is some other reason, I do not know.  Eventually I anticipate that competition and pressure from the user base (me!) will force Apple to relent on this.\n\nIn the 21st century, devices like the iPad2 are destined to become a fundamental part of our personal kit.  The iPad2 is beautifully made, and for most of us very much worth having.  Highly recommended.  RJB."}

After communication with the vendor, we learned it is necessary to \"activate\" the ipad by plugging it in to an internet-connected computer with subsequent connection to itunes. However, even after \"activation\" there are still no instructions as to how to set basic things up such as email. My husband ended up taking it in to his tech people to set up basic needs, and this has taken a large amount of time and work (and still is not complete over a month later with multiple people involved).\n\nThis is disappointing since the unit cost over $1,000. Surely, basic setup instructions should be included for an item of this value!!!\n\nPerhaps buying an ipad from this vendor might be good for those of you already highly knowledgeable in how to set an ipad up. For the rest of you, do even consider buying here. Go to an Apple store or to another source that offers basic installation instructions and help. My iphone works great, but I bought it from an Apple store where all my questions were answered up front. I wish I had bought this ipad from the same store.\n\nBottom line: the hardware coming from this vendor is probably fine. There is no set up help or instruction,however, so avoid this vendor unless you already know what you need to do.\n\nWe cannot yet review the ipad itself since it is not yet set up after many weeks of trying."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Intro: I've always been a fan of Android and prefer it to iOS, but I must admit that at the moment, Apple has the best tablet on the market. After trying to decide between the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and iPad 2, I pulled the trigger on the iPad 2 (16GB, Wi-Fi, Black) and have yet to regret my decision.\n\nPros:\n*Apps - The best feature about the iPad is the App Store, and this was the deciding factor for me. On a smartphone, there's a bit more to consider than apps (call quality, carrier, camera quality-in my opinion, pointless on a tablet-,etc.), but on a tablet, it's all about the functionality delivered through tablet-optimized apps.\n*Design - The iPad 2 is very thin, light, and has a nice aluminum finish on the back. The only comparably sized tablet is the Galaxy Tab 10.1.\n*Screen - The screen is great, especially in terms of quality and contrast. It's a 9.7\" IPS screen with a 1024x768 resolution.\n*Battery life - Excellent. It has the best battery life of tablets (Galaxy Tab 10.1 comes close). To get an idea, it lasts for days with some gaming/web browsing each day.\n*Accessories - Because the iPad is basically the epitome/name-brand of tablets at the moment, if there's a tablet accessory, it's compatible with the iPad.\n*Resale value - If I decide to sell it later to upgrade to the inevitable iPad 3, I know it will maintain most of its value.\n\nCons:\n*Cameras - Although I will probably never use them, the cameras on the iPad 2 are horrible.\n*Screen - Competitor tablets have a bigger 10.1\" screen, but my biggest complaint is the lower resolution of the iPad (1024x768 vs 1280x800).

Heck, I taught my grandmother how to use it in an hour and she has no grasp of technology whatsoever.\n\nCustomize\nOne can customize the placement of their applications based on how often that one uses them, by category, by favorite, or however ones wants, you can completely customize the order of your apps.\n\nCamera and Weight\nThe IPad 2 is thinner then its predecessor as well as lighter, it also includes a front and rear camera which makes video chatting via Facetime efficient. However, the quality of these cameras are nowhere near the standards that one expects to see from a piece of technology, especially at the price that Apple charges. Apple cites that the small mega-pixel camera is the result of a thin design, which I understand. I do not use my IPad to take pictures, I do however carry it everywhere. It's thin and light design enables me to slip it in to that last little space of room in my backpack without adding much weight.\n\nMedia and Graphics\nFor those of you that are on the go, you can use the IPad for games, music, videos, and even writing word documents. I however, do not like watching movies on my IPad, because any movie that comes from Itunes is only in wide screen format which makes the actual movie frame very small. That and the not so great quality of movie graphics, makes me reluctant to do so. The graphics on the IPad 2 are good when not watching movies, when watching they are are not terrible but they are not great, and can be vastly improved.\n\nThe Keyboard\nWhat bothers me the most about the IPad 2 is the keyboard, the letters are shrunk so that the keyboard can fit, but it was not done proportionally. The lack o  a quick transition between symbols, numbers, and letters makes note taking inefficient on the IPad 2."}

The new unit performed as advertised.  Replacing the IPAD took less than a week.  If you are going to use Verizon 3G, then I would recommend that the IPAD be purchased directly from your local Verizon shop.  This will insure that the unit is working properly before you pay.

Would you like to watch videos you already own on a mobile Device without hours of re-encoding to Apples proprietary format for each video you want to watch?\n\nWell then don't buy Apple products because they have the same IRON Grip on every one. I own Apple products (luckily I didn't have to buy them all my job did) and I've been sorely disappointed with every one. Apple products have not Flash support, no Java support, and no support for almost any video formats that are not Apple proprietary.\n\nIf you want a mobile pad that plays almost any video I would suggest the Asus Eee pad both support flash, and both support Java, so that means online streaming sites work, and online flash games work. (two things Apple don't want you to be able to use so you have to get videos and games from them.)\n\nNow I can't speak for the Galaxy (though I've heard good things) but the Asus Eee pad is great for video. To watch video on the Asus Eee pad you plug in the pad, it comes up as a drive, you drag your video files to the Asus pad, and then you watch them without having to re-encode. This pad has played every video file I've tried. Be smart get almost anything other than an Ipad, you'll be happier not being told what you can do, and what to buy, that is ALMOST as good as what YOU actually want to do with a product YOU spent money for.\n\nAnd remember don't drink the Apple Kool-aid and don't listen to the brainwashed hype of the Apple sheep who tell you to stay in the heard."}

The screen is great for reading in dark and well lighted areas and the text unless very small is easy to read. The OS is amazing and will only get better with ios 5 the apps such as evernote make the iPad the perfect notebook to read notes on etc. Battery life is incredible I can easily go 3-4 days without needing a recharge however I get 10-12 hours with constant use. If you truly want to use the iPad to it's full potential I recommend getting a smart cover it doesn't interfear with docks and cleans the screen as well as works as a great stand. The only downside I can think of is the keyboard it's awkward to use at times and can make you want to shorten or leave out words to type faster (using iPad now). I highly recommend getting an MacBook air and iMac if you can afford it. Using several computer setups I have never found a setup that just works like these 3 put together.\n\nUPDATE: iOS 5 brings many more features students will love such a document sharing and iCloud backup over wifi after a full quarter using this device I have had zero issues and my battery still gets around ten hours of actual use before dying on me."}

I also thought that ALL iPads had to be sold at the same price - I could be wrong here, because I heard that through a friend. I don't know how long of a wait shipping is here, but as of this writing, my delivery date would be July 22-24.\n\nSo, if you don't mind the wait and you want the best deal for your iPad 2, Apple is the best bet.

Goes anywhere and the fact I can FaceTime with friends across state/ country is totally Star Trek, (I mean, this man totally knew what was coming.

Figured since you are not bound by a contract, (ie. 2 years to subscribe) I would get the 3G just in case I ever wanted that feature. You cannot upgrade. If I were to go on a trip, I could subscribe to 3G for a month and then cancel. THAT is AWESOME."}

Present iPad technology requires a stylus pen w/ an eraser tip for iPad to \"read\" the marks you make. Any way to make a different type of interface sensitivity (pressure  vs electrical charge of skin) to enable a finer tip as needed? Yes, one can choose tips and brushes, but requiring so much surface of the eraser tip to create a line seems inefficient.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I love my Ipad2. It is fast, very reliable and stable, and just plain fun.  But there are a few things that keep it from being perfect.  First, as other reviewers have commented, the camera is the pits and really not up to Apple's ususal outstanding quality.  The second issue, in my opinion, is the slick aluminum back side material.  It looks pretty but really necessitates a case because it is slippery and without a means to get a better grip, it is only a matter of time before the inevitable fall.  I found the same problem with my Iphone.  It would be a much better devise if Apple used a rubberized type material on the back.  I spent alot of time comparing the Ipad2 with the Motorola Xoom at Best Buy before making my purchase, and I really don't think you could go wrong with either tablet.  The Xoom has a far better camera and does flash which might be a big plus if you are really into video and gaming. But flash also comes at a cost in performance and stability which is exactly why Apple doesn't use it.  The Ipad2 seems more intuitive to me and just seems to work better and do things quicker. But I have to admit that my familiarity with Iphone may partly influence my opinion on that point. Ipad also has many more apps available at the moment. One other drawback though,in my opinion, is the need to tether the Ipad to Itunes. I understand their logic, but I really wish it had a simpler PC-Ipad interface. Honestly if I didn't already have an Iphone I might have been inclined to buy the Xoom, but that's not taking anything away from the Ipad2 - it is a great tablet!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "By now there are plenty of reviews that offer the pros and cons of the iPad 2 versus other tablets on the market.  With that in mind, I've decided to focus this particular review only for those of you who are in the same boat as me - which is debating whether or not to upgrade to an iPad 2 from the first gen iPad.\n\nAfter giving it much thought, I recently took the plunge and I am 100% sure that I made the right decision.  However, this is only in the context of how I use the tablet, which is primarily for gaming and other graphic intensive apps.  Previously I owned the AT&T 3G iPad with 32GB of memory.  After giving it much thought, I decided to purchase the wi-fi only 64GB iPad 2, since I realized I don't actually used the 3G much.\n\nMost of the apps I use are very graphic intensive.  EA games such as Dead Space, FIFA 11 ... or Gameloft games such as Order & Chaos, Starfront, and Dungeon Hunter ... I play those games often and noticed a HUGE difference after I transferred my data to the iPad 2.  The games run much better, and there is a major change in terms of performance.  There is much less slowdown, and FIFA 11 actually plays like the way it should - fast and crisp (and not slow and turgid, like it was when I was playing the exact same game on the first gen iPad).  In cases like this - having the faster processor and added RAM makes a huge difference.\n\nNow if you're the kind of person who plays simpler, less graphic intensive games like Angry Birds, Diner Dash or World of Goo, you will probably not notice anything different.  You also won't really notice any difference if you stream or purchase videos as the display is the same as before.  Sorry, but no retina display this time around.\n\nBut what you will be pleased with is the fact the iPad 2 is far lighter than it's predecessor.  This is important for those of you who spend a lot on the iPad playing games (like me).  It was no secret that the previous iPad was bulky and difficult to hold.  It also made it very tiring to grab the device for an extended period of time (making it difficult to play intense FPS or sports game without frequent rest periods).  The iPad 2's weight makes it much easier to hold and less burdensome to play games for a long time.  Long story short, my hands don't feel numb as often as I did when I used the old iPad.\n\nAs for the other bells and whistles such as the camera/face time, etc ... all of that is well and good.  The interface is easy to figure out, so there isn't much brain surgery involved.  The smart cover is also a nice touch, though it's not a necessity.  I personally have one though, and I like it very much.\n\nSo the biggest question here is - should you upgrade to iPad 2 if you already own one?  If you are a die hard gamer, the answer is 100% absolutely yes.  The difference in performance is absolutely striking and you will see the benefits of upgrading within seconds (so long as you play games that take advantage of the upgrade - i.e. games w/high production value).\n\nEven the apps I run outside of games run noticeably smoother and faster.  Using video/graphic intensive apps like CNN or ESPN XL is a snap, and they run much faster than on my previous iPad.\n\nIn short, should you upgrade from the iPad to the iPad 2?\n\n1. If you play hardcore, graphic-intensive games - YES, upgrade ASAP\n\n2. If you run a lot of apps at the same time, like to use video/graphic intensive apps - YES, upgrade\n\n3. If you run apps that aren't that taxing (lighthearted games like Angry Birds, simple interface apps), or use the ipad to mostly surf, write email, etc - NO, upgrading is not necessary unless you have cash to spare (save your $$ for the iPad after the iPad 2 IMO).\n\nThat's my 2 cents for folks on the fence.  Good luck!"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "At first this device was the best thing I had ever bought! Two weeks later I'm kind of disappointed.\n\nI have had a couple of issues with this device, biggest one being serious issues with wifi connectivity. Apparently this has been a common issue for ipad 2. I found a fix for mine, which is to say its not complete junk, but definitely an inconvenience to go through all the steps again and again to fix it. The other issue is I keep having audio problems...sometimes when muted it cant unmute itself and I have to restart it in order to get my audio working again. The camera picture quality is not great, in fact its useless. The video quality is decent in good lighting, very usable if you can really see yourself taking video with a 10 inch tablet. The device isn't heavy for me, but my older mother found it heavy for her to hold after only using it for 5 minutes, which is why I would also recommend getting the smart cover for it..it can turn into some pretty useful sturdy positions for typing, reading, or watching video.\n\nThe positives of this device, I was surprised at how great the screen would be. I thought it would scratch easy or be high maintenance...but its been really easy to keep clean with a small microfiber cloth (not included). Apps load fast, graphics are nice, and perfect for netbook replacement as long as you don't do a ton of typing. Its great for social media and web browsing, but i would NOT use this as an ebook reader, your eyes start to hurt after reading for awhile. Get the kindle for that.\n\nI think the app store is slightly over hyped, i have found two unique apps that i couldn't have got for an android tablet...but overall the most popular apps seem to be on both devices."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I bought the original iPad on \"day 1\", and have really enjoyed it for over a year now. When iPad 2 came out, I thought it was a nice evolutionary step, but not enough for me to upgrade.\n\nHowever, the seemingly small changes do turn out to make a difference.  For example, one of my favorite uses of the original iPad was to read various newspapers and blogs while having breakfast. That worked pretty well, but the limited memory of the original iPad caused web-pages to rarely be cached: Following a link and then hitting the \"back\" button felt a bit sluggish. With iPad 2, this scenario works a lot better. Similarly, FaceTime and video Skype support were attractive to me, but I figured that having an iPhone 4 already would largely mitigate the advantage of having the feature also on iPad.  Well, the larger size of iPad 2 makes it much more natural to have my daughter join alongside of me in a conversation with overseas family members. The small weight and dimension differences also have a disproportional effect. My kids use a drawing app that also seems to benefit from the added hardware capabilities (memory-bound, I think) and GarageBand is even more impressive on iPad 2 than its already remarkable power on my original iPad.\n\nI had a chance to try some other tablets (Xoom, 7\" Samsung, and Nook color), but at this time they're far behind iPad in just about every respect (the Nook color's low weight is nice though). The Xoom's screen has odd dimension when web-browsing or reading (it's nice when watching certain movies, but the experience improvement is small compared to the the reduced experience for most other applications, including non-wide-format videos). The smaller Samsung device indeed feels quite small, and, like the Xoom, it's missing nice applications in just about every major category.  Nook color is the least of all these alternatives, but perhaps the most attractive considering its lower price and light weight."}

Sadly, the only thing I have found so far that made me smile was when I got to watch Family Guy on HULU while stuck in the Las Vegas Airport. So, all in all, I am unimpressed. Outside of the \"cool\" factor, I really don't understand the flurry of excitement over this technology. Service from Amazon was amazing and hopefully I will get something to use this for.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Even though I've discovered I'm not a fan of the iPad (or touch-screen devices that are any larger than the pocket-sized iPod), the iPad 1 has definitely been the most popular item in our household when the grand-kids visit, and my wife's minimal use of it in the classroom has led her to acquiring this iPad 2 model (though even since then she's found a computer-tablet that's much smoother, more responsive and precise in accepting and projecting the extra-fine details of mathematical equations and geometric symmetry. The iPad's various styli, with their resistant, rubbery \"nubs,\" still leave much to be desired).  Yet, overall there would appear to be few if any viable alternatives at this stage.  Apple was first to the parade and, according to practically every review of the latest model (including that most popular consumer's magazine), continues to remain in the top position.\n\nThe primary advantage of the Apple 2--from my perspective--would appear to be the lighter weight and more compact size.  Personally, I found the iPad 1 to be hot and heavy compared to my Air 11\", which I now use for practically all of my computing.  So be sure to take note of screen size and overall weight of any other device you may be considering before ordering.  Also, note that the highest-rated tablet on Amazon (the Toshiba) has yet to be released!  If you're considering it, it would seem overly hasty if not reckless not to wait for it to \"test out\" on the market for a few months.\n\nAs for the iPad, the Flash controversy proved a non-issue for my wife and me.  The lack of certain ports--for HDMI, USB, display, etc.--was never anything that couldn't be addressed and fixed with a readily available adapter.  Finally, look for any other machine that comes close to the iPad in terms of the galaxy of available \"apps.\"  The lack of a keyboard (true of most any tablet) can also be addressed--but now we're getting close to a Macbook Air, which strikes me as the more practical purchase in the first place.\n\nIn short, there's every reason to spring for another iPad (if you like the concept in the first place) and a number of reasons to withhold purchase of any other brand.  But a caveat: this is one of the few times that I've found a product sold through Amazon to be significantly higher in cost, even without sales tax, than the same product purchased through Apple Store.\n\n[As a musician, I've found a reason to like this device: it can be loaded up with musical scores (several life-times' worth) and set on a stand or piano ledger, the equivalent of a giant-sized cabinet full of notated music contained within a thin, easily readable and navigable tablet.]"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have the 64GB with AT&T 3G.  I absolutely love my iPad.  It does everything and i've been impressed with it in the 2 months that i've owned it so far.  I use it primarily as my internet browser, an e-reader, and to stream Netflix.  It's a revolutionary  product for me.  The iPad has replaced my laptop as my go-to for internet.  I no longer take my laptop with me on business trips.  The iPad does everything I need.  It doesn't replace the need for a computer, but it does allow me to travel without my laptop and to leave the laptop in the office (or the kitchen where it usually lives) when I want internet access on the couch.\n\nHere are some of the key features that I use:\n\nThe web browser is the real deal.  It's full internet and not a mobile browser.  I like surfing the web on my iPad better than on my computer because the touch screen and gestures are very intuitive.\n\nFacetime and Skype look great and are easy to use with the dual cameras.  It's nice to be on the road and be able to see my daughter any time I have an internet connection (Facetime requires WiFi, but you can Skype on the 3G).\n\nAs an e-reader, I haven't used it to read a full book yet, but I do often use iBooks to crunch PDF files that I use for work.  It allows you to search and bookmark.  The bookmarks then transfer to your iPhone via MobileMe.  It's nice because I have literally thousands of pages of regulations and tech orders at my fingertips in a very portable format.  The backlight screen is nice when reading in a dark environment and I've found it comfortable to use when reading for 15-20 minuets.  I haven't read any longer than that, so I don't know if it will cause eye fatigue over a longer period.\n\nVideo looks great.  64GB is plenty of space.  I'm currently carrying 17 movies, about 11 GBs of music, 10 GBs of Apps, all of my books and I still have about 20 free GBs to load anything else.  I could probably have gotten away with the 32 GB model.\n\nNetflix streaming is awesome!  They have a great selection and the app looks really good.\n\nGames on the iPad are really fun.  I have a few board games and you can sit across from someone and use the iPad as your Monopoly board.  The large display makes it a pretty social device.\n\nThe news apps look really good and have the feel of reading a magazine.\n\nPros - It does everything.  It looks good, is very light and the battery performance is fantastic.  Apple's claim of 10 hrs of use is true.  The battery really lasts a long time.  The 3G service is a good deal.  I don't always use it, so you can set the 3G up to \"pay as you go\".  If you need to use the 3G, you can enter your credit card info right into the iPad and sign up for a month of service.  It's $15 for 250 MB and $25 for 2GB.  You can cancel without a penalty and there's no long term commitment.\n\nCons - Price.  The iPad is expensive, and you could buy a laptop for the same price (or cheaper).  It's a great device and I think it's worth it, but the price is pretty steep.  Lack of Flash support, which is common to all iOS devices.\n\nOverall, I really love my iPad, I use it for everything and I take it with me routinely."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I've done a ton of research on tablets, and ultimately decided on the iPad 2. I like the customization of android, but in the end it came down to the stability and the vast amount of apps. Before considering buying an iPad I was wondering why people would not shut up about how many apps there are, well now I really do get it. While some of them aren't very useful for me, there are quite a few i would say that are very well designed and extremely useful and just plain entertaining.\n\nI really hated the fact that there was no flash, and no true multiple tasking, but after taking a chance on the iPad I realized I really didn't notice the flash too much, however, the lack of true multitasking can be frustrating at times. The iOS definitely needs an update, but for the first time user it will be a pleasurable experience.\n\nThe quality of the ipad is incredible, and the experience from startup to actually using the device was impressive to say the least. The screen is beautiful and the screen is extremely responsive. Oh, and not to forget, the battery life is unreal at a true ten plus hours of browsing and streaming video and audio.\n\nThe Internet browsing experience is very nice, I've had no issues at all. The web pages render perfectly and overall is a blast to use ( even without flash).\n\nI would whole heartily recommend the iPad 2 to anyone seeking a device that allows you to browse the web, check email, play games, check and pay bills, loves creating anything at all, or just wants to sit on the couch and watch some Netflix. The iPad isn't flawless but at this price it is very fair for what you get. If you are looking to totally replace your laptop, it's possible, but it just depends on what you really use it for. I personally replaced my laptop with this device and never looked back.\n\nHope this helps."}

You have to buy iTunes comparable packages to use the iPad. Free Apps are NOT all free - there is usually a fee to make them work to the point they are enjoyable. Don't even try to upload ANY of your own music or movies. Apple is sooo proprietary that if you didn't buy the music or movies through iTunes you can't use it on the iPad. And when you try to access the Internet, better-off using your Mac/PC. Moreover, accessing Wikipedia or nearly any other sites that uses videos to enhance the info, entertainment, music you can only watch around 70% of the content. Sure, the Flash is not available for iPad but it should be able to play the other videos. On Aug 5th, I called Mac customer service and the rep even said he could not believe Apple sent out the iPad 2 without some kind of plug-in or app to make the iPad more user friendly with the Internet. Oh, one more, DO NOT set the iPad face down or it will slip off nearly any surface you think is flat. The front surface is so slippery.\n\nI don't have the time to list and all negative experiences have been experienced only owning it for three months. However, I must say, the screen is bright and clear. The iPad is light and sturdy. The apps that do work, work VERY well. The processor is extremely FAST! It is not a horrible product. It just needs to mature a little.\n\nI have been using Apple/Mac and PC products for more than three decades and could not speak higher of the quality and ease of use of Apple/Mac until now. I'll probably be buying a different brand like a HP Slate 500, LG G-Slate, Viewsonic ViewPad 7, RIM BlackBerry PlayBook - to name a few next time unless I pad 4 is more compatible with reality. Please, for the love of all good things, heed my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS! (At least not yet.) Nearly ANY other pad/tablet at two thirds the price will do much more than the iPad 2.\n\n* NOTE * DO NOT BUY THE iPad magnetic Smart Cover. It easily slips off and WILL traumatically send your iPad to an early demise.\n\nNo, I would not recommend this to a family member or friend at this time. Remember, we are at the very beginning of the pad/tablet generation! Every year as the Internet develops, the tablets will follow. Good luck!"}

After a month of frequent use, I must say it is the nearest to perfection piece of technology I have ever owned. For context, my use is casual non-pro reading email, checking out Youtube, reading my favorite websites, and playing games. All of these are better than on a PC, Mac, or Ipod Touch, all of which I have experienced and own. Being a guy in his 50's, I like the ability to read with finger swipes, and adjust the font size to suit my eyes. I like the Flipboard app organization of articles I read. I like the expanding selection of strategy games like Ticket to Ride, Civ, and Knizia's games. I find I prefer using this for email over my Mac, because of speed. I like saving pdf files in a \"bookcase.\" I like Skyping, although my Mac is better at keeping my mug in the shot. I like showing my pix on it's big screen. The battery really does last 10 hours.\nSince getting this, my usage split has gone to about ~20% Mac Book Air, ~80% iPad.\n\nNow, if I could just figure out iMovie to edit my videos..."}

This is not a laptop/netbook or a desktop.\n\nReview for: iPad 2, 32gb 3G White with smart cover.\n\nGood:\n- IOS is the only stable tablet OS available right now in my opinion, yes android may be able to multi-task better but 99% of users will not know the difference. As for stability IOS (Apple) is miles ahead of Google.\n- Tons of tablet optimized applications, I have around 20 that I use regularly and never had a problem with any of them.\n- Zinio iPad application, if you are a Zinio subscriber the iPad is the best way to read your magazines. Much much faster than using even a desktop and also much more pleasant to read and use.\n- Can play pretty much any kind of video (including avi, mkv and others)if you install AVPlayerHD and output via HDMI. No stutter like on current batch of honeycomb tablets, at least in 720p which I use...\n- Great keyboard (virtual).\n- Battery we get around 11 hours on a charge with wifi on.\n- Stanby is even better you can most likely leave the tab unplugged and come back a week later to use it. If android phones are anything to go by android tablets probably don't have anywhere near the same standby performance. (can't remember the number of times I forget to plug my android phone at night and wake up with it dead, while my wife never plugs her iPhone and )\n\nCould have been better:\n- Flash support would have been good but I can live without it and quite frankly I just wish flash would go away from the web. Its not secure, is a resource hog and basically not very good technology in my opinion.\n- An sd card slot for expanding memory or keeping your music/movie collection on. So far I did not see a need for this but could be something I miss in the future.\n\nI don't like (in general for all Apple IOS devices):\n- Can only sync to one computer and the iTunes on that computer. What if you have more than one computer ? or quite simply want to load something at work and you are synced with a computer at home ? Your only choice is the cloud and even then you are limited with what you can put on the iPad.\n\nSummary very much like the iPad 2 and just ordered a second one as my wife has taken ownership of the current one. She uses it for work now and pretty much never touches her laptop... She is a university teacher, psychologist and researcher. The iPad is perfect for most of her needs from reading research documents to taking notes and light document writing."}

These are not necessarily downsides, just things that are keeping me from using it separately from the computer.\n\nIt should really be able to update the podcasts I'm subscribed to automatically via wifi - it shouldn't require reconnecting to iTunes.\n\nThe virtually seamless integration it has with the Apple TV is proof to me that it should be capable of doing these things.\n\nThe battery life is pretty impressive. The biggest issues I have with its power relate to charging. It comes with a special 10W power adapter which allows you to charge the iPad in a relatively reasonable timeframe, but charging it via the computer's USB port is as easily measured in days as hours.\n\nThe charger looks exactly like the ones that come with the iPhone and iPod, and it will charge slowly with those, but the iPad's 10W adapter will overcharge the batteries in the iPad's smaller cousins, seriously diminishing their life. Again, not really a limitation on the iPad, but something for users to be aware of... I've labeled mine \"iPad only\" just to be absolutely sure I don't hurt my other equipment.\n\nThe front facing camera is pretty low quality. As a camera intended to be used for video chat, thats ok.\nThe rear facing camera is pretty low quality.  As a camera intended to be used for actually taking pictures, it's pretty inexcusable.\nThis is where they lost the star in my rating - I can get around the other deficiencies with iOS apps and by connecting to the computer, and just by being careful, but there's no overcoming a built-in hardware limitation like this."}

I have now started calling it crApple. All they do it market this product as if it is the best thing in the world, but it is definitely not.\n\nSo why 3 stars.\n\nPros:\nYes there is some good stuff, but I do not know how unique it is to Apple. Size, weight and battery life is super. You can use it the whole day, and angry birds is seriously addictive. It remembers each network and its settings so that I do not have to manually change proxy settings everytime I move from office to another place.\n\nCons:\nEveryone has said it but I'll say it again: No flash = No point! It is so annoying that you have to keep going from one applet to another to do things that you can normally do on a browser. Seriously, if you tube just decided to use flash and to remove their App I think Apple would go bankrupt.\n\nEditing stuff is impossible or as difficult as doing it on your phone, with the exception of a larger keyboard. Speaking of the keyboard I cannot for the life of me understand why apple cannot put arrow keys on it! So annoying! Yes there is a magnifier which allows you to scroll the cursor but how tedious it is!\n\nA lot of the other stuff has been mentioned in other reviews but these were teh maain points for me.\n\nAlso - a note for people considering a laptop or this - buy a laptop. This is the 3rd thing you need.\n\nThis is really ideal for someone who has a large heavy laptop which stays in one place and needs a lighter device to carry around for just brisk surfing, checking mail, watching some youtube and playing games (ie a bigger version of an iPhone).\n\nHowever, if I knew what I know now I would never have bought this thing. I would wait until google improves Android or microsoft comes up with some hardware that will kick Apple of its perch, because there is nothing like a normal windows operating system. I need flash, I need to be able to open, edit and  attach my edited files to gmail through a browser. I need flash (yes I said it again). I also want to be able to download whatever software I like and run it, without it having to be a mobile App.\n\nI think what has happened is that I made the mistake of thinking that the bigger screen meant that this was a real computer, rather than just another mobile device with all its limitation. So don;t buy this if you think you are getting a real computer. It is just a bigger version of a phone, and if it is not the 3G version it is just a rich mans toy."}

My biggest reason for wanting an iPad 2 was I found the screen of the touch too small to surf the web or read a book, I wanted GPS (have to get the 3G model for that), camera (we use FaceTime a lot keeping in touch with family) and 3G for internet access for when we travel and are at places with no wifi.  I spend many hours at various sporting practices each week and for the past two years, the touch has kept me entertained (I actually looked forward to practice since it gave me at least two hours to sit and catch up on everything).\n\nThe iPad has taken it to a whole new level.  I have more reading material than I can read (books, magazines, email, etc.).  I love Netflix and HBO GO and I use it to stargaze at night (it can control my telescope through an app).  The entire family likes it so much that It's made the touches obsolete.  My husband who never liked the touch keeps taking my iPad.  The best part for me is that I am no longer chained to the computer.  I can read the news and check my calendar at the kitchen table or the over stuffed chair while having me coffee.  The only thing I've been using the laptop for is syncing.\n\nMy complaints are that I can no longer use my computer to charge the iPad (the car charger is also obsolete for the iPad.  I had to but a new one).  I also purchased two extra long USB cables and an extra charging brick as the cords that come with it are too short to charge and sit comfortably on the couch.  I also found that I can no longer use my Altec Lansing speaker dock to play music so that's something else I'll want to replace eventually.\n\nI purchased 1GB of data from Verizon for $20 for the month to see how far it would go.  I've been pleasantly surprised.  I may run out of time to use it before I run out of data.  Granted we have wifi at home and gymnastics but baseball, the grandparents, car and the doctor's office do not.  I thought streaming Netflix and HBO GO would use all of it up but it hasn't."}

I did have a few instances where once you turned off the cellular modem you could not get reconnected without turning it back on and rebooting. However, that has not been an issue for the last several weeks and the modem gets turned on and off several times a day. Either i have been lucky or they fixed the glitch.

It is not as intuitive as I would have liked for someone who is not familiar with Apple products."}

I could just feel and smell the greed from these vendors. My suggestion is if you could wait for another month or so, the supply issue will stabilize and bring the Ipad 2 prices back to its normal price without the price gouging. You could also order from Apple online which I did and I got mine in 8 days. So the choice is yours if you want to support these greedy vendors or get it in 8 days from Apple online."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The biggest change in our lives so far with the arrival of our iPad 2 is now that we have three of them, no one is without an ipad 24/7.  You wouldn't think this would be a big deal but it is.  It has eliminated all discord here plus the place is quiet as a tomb most of the time as each person is curled up with his own ipad. We are a husband and wife in our 60s plus my husband's mother who is 100 years old. She is curled up with the iPad almost all day long as her ability to do anything active has all but vanished. She goes easily  from reading a Danielle Steele ebook to watching a Prince William and Kate lifetime movie.\n\nThe above is both versions of the iPad's biggest virtue: ANYONE OF ANY AGE CAN USE IT.  Both my husband and I are techie types so we are quite expert on computers.  Friends in our age range usually are not.  My advice to every one of them is \"buy an ipad.\"  It puts those with low tech abilities on an even playing field because they do everything with their fingers and visually.  It is the supreme compliment to say about either iPad, \"any idiot can use it.\"\n\nRight now you can't buy an iPad 1.  We were going to buy a third one of those on sale but they sold out so fast that we had to get the iPad 2 as our third one.  My husband is the one who appreciates subtle refinements in electronics.  He has been in seventh heaven since it arrived.  Truthfully, my mother in law and I, as long as we can get on it and read our books, watch our movies, assemble recipes in our app cookbook, and so forth and so on, are happy as can be and both iPad versions do that extremely well.  My husband is the one who waxes rhapsodically over lighter weight, better LED screen, improved battery life, and so forth.  Like most reviewers of iPad 2 he concludes that it is a beautiful evolution but not a revolution from the first iPad.\n\nFor those of you with extended families elsewhere, there are other new features which could be huge features for you.  The ability now to visit with family members by video with your ipad 2 are completely built in.  It has two way cameras. I would like to talk our other family members in California into getting one for the benefit of my mother-in-law, who could have excellent \"visits\" by iPad with all of them.\n\nAlso if you want to stream what is on your ipad directly to your HDTV and projectors, that too is now built in. We don't have such a tv because we like watching directly on the iPad itself with earphones.\n\nThere is also the ability to not only take your own videos but to edit them online. Plus the ability to locate your ipad if it is lost and to wipe its contents remotely.\n\nThese above new features are opening up a lot of possibilities for educators as well.  Apple maintains an entire subsection on its website to helping educators use the new features to iPad 2 to best advantage.  Essentially, it wants to enable them to use the iPad 2 to put its content onto a screen immediately in front of their students with the teacher controlling the whole thing with his or her fingers.  Go over to Apple to check this all out as it is incredible.\n\nI absolutely love the camera on the iPad 2.  There was no camera on the iPad 1.  Much as I have always loved my iPhone's camera, and much as I complained about who would want to use a camera the size of the iPad 2, I admit I underestimated it.  It is just a fabulous camera and with just pointing and shooting you take pictures that look as if a professional had taken them.\n\nI also researched this cover that apple was pushing real hard.  It looks great but i discovered the users were not happy with it.  Turns out they have to clean their screens every time they use it because it leaves three big marks on the glass every time.  They also said it was unstable as a stand and one guy smashed his ipad on the floor as a result, shattering it.  Apple is not very good at these accessory devices.  So we ordered the zoogue ipad 2 case and are very happy with it. We have zoogues on our other two ipads as well and are totally happy with them.  Just put the word zoogue into search engines to find it."}

It's almost worthwhile to consult someone who has an iPad or someone who can guide you to what would work best in you personal daily use. This is in most cases not going to replace a laptop, or a desktop computer. The size of the screen is really nice, but then you can't put it in a suit jacket pocket. Nice to have with you, Yes. Easy to leave laying somewhere, Yes. Work with major programs, such as Adobe or FileMaker, only in an emergency and only if the program exists for the iPad (up until now only some mini versions exist). Make sure what you want to primarily want to do, really exists, this i not Mac OS X, this is iOS 4.3. If staying online is that important AND you don't mind carrying it around (it's not heavy, but it's bulky), then you could consider this gadget. It's like a sports car, it's nice to have, but it's not a necessity. What would be nice is something between the iPad 2 and the iPhone / iPad Touch sized iPad mini, that would be half the screen size of the iPad 2. This way, it might not fit in all suit jacket pockets, but could be carried in a shoulder holster or similar carrier under the jacket, sweater or what have you. The larger size to accommodate the over 40 seeing problem and big finger dilemmas."}

The only only reason why I bought the iPad 2 was for the front facing camera which is pretty cool.\n\nFor the gamers I downloaded Deadspace, which is designed to take advantage of the iPad 2's enhanced graphics.  I have to say it's a good looking game and should start to scare Microsoft and Playstation since Apple is starting to further encroach on the gaming market.  I wouldnt be surprised if the next gen iPad is up there with ps3 and xbox 360.  The only thing really holding the iPad back gaming wise is the lack of a bluetooth controller, I hate using the screen as a controller!\n\nIf you don't own an iPad I definitely recommend you buy one, it's pretty amazing :P.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Although advertised as superior and significantly more updated than the original iPad, the iPad 2 is not all that different than its recent ancestor. A categorical comparison quickly reveals that the quick release and updates were unnecessary in such a short amount of time. For new buyers, by all means get the iPad 2 and the updated features. However, for those owners of an original iPad, do not waste $500 buying this \"new and improved\" product, because the $600 original you are holding in your hands right now is essentially the same.\n\nFor starters, the dimensions for both products are the same, with the exception of the width. The iPad 2 is 0.16 inches thinner than the original, resulting in a 0.15-pound decrease in weight. Both devices have the same amount of storage, however the iPad 2 has double the amount of RAM memory performance, which leads to faster download times and less of the \"checkerboard effect.\"  Both devices include models with Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi + 3G and Bluetooth capabilities. The displays are the same size and both feature the fingerprint resistant oleophobic coating. The processor on the iPad 2 features the Dual-Core A5 chip, whereas the original only has the A5 chip, but upon consistent use, the speed appears to be about the same. The original iPad uses the Mac iOS 4.2.1 operating system, which is just a step down from the iPad 2's iOS 4.3 operating system, and few differences are noted, and nearly none are experienced.\n\nThe one feature that Apple is heavily marketing is the user's ability to FaceTime another iPad 2 user. Although this is cool, is it really worth spending an extra $500 if you already own an iPad? Why not just use your iPhone? Or Skype? Apple is also talking up the iPad 2's 10-hour battery life. They must be hoping no one does their research, because the original iPad has the exact same battery life! The iPad 2 also features a new, smart cover. What's really \"smart\" about an electronic device cover, I'm not entirely sure. I own an original iPad black leather cover and I think it's pretty smart too.\n\nIf you are reading this review and do not own an iPad at all, by all means go for the new iPad 2. It's fast, skinny and features a camera and FaceTime abilities. However, if you already are the proud owner of an original iPad, do not waste your money. If it only took Apple one measly year to release an iPad 2, it probably won't take much longer to release an iPad 3 or 4. By that time, maybe the updates will actually be worth burning a hole in your wallet. For now, my suggestion is save your money, cherish your original iPad, and wait until an \"upgraded\" product comes along that actually presents some significant improvements."}

Within a day or two the announcements concerning a few of Apple's hottest products .. iPad 2 & iPhone, we all know what those concerns are hit the media circuits.  I can't speak for you but, I most certainly don't want my every waking moment tracked - especially as deviously as Apple has set out to do. Apple didn't ask permission, didn't bother putting it in the \"fine\" print and when caught red-handed wouldn't even address. I have a million questions of my own i.e., whose idea was this, is Apple being paid by \"?\", is he government involved - what? It's out of control .. Everthing! I like my toys as much as the next guy but will trash them if this I Spy chit continues.  Needless to say I am not in the market for an iPad in the near furture.  My opinion, not a review granted - had I already purchased the iPad it would have been longer, louder and most likely censored!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Apple markets this as the ultimate portable computer product, but it has serious shortcomings similar to the iPhone that I wasn't aware of as I don't own one.  If you have no interest in external files or photos, then this may not be important to you.  I waited a month for mine to be delivered, and after a week, I can say I'm keenly disappointed for specific reasons of Apple's own making.\n\nYou can't transfer ANY file to it, you can only SYNC all files from one designated computer, i.e. tethered.\n\nDespite reading enormous reviews & comments about the original, as well as the 2, I never got the impression from anyone that this was the case.  There were a few rumblings about \"file handling\" and workarounds for it [\"everything's going to the cloud anyway\" \"just use dropbox\"] - but nothing that says what an incredible restriction it is for anyone using photos/movies at all.  Their only official solution is that you buy a $40 dongle that then will allow SD card content [no CF cards, which I have]  to be transferred directly.  But the worst part is that even if you were to transfer anything to it, it all gets dumped at the bottom of  \"saved photos\" without any file separation, and no ability to separate or make collections of them after transfer either.\n\nUnlike my iPods, you can NEVER transfer any existing file to another, or create a new one.  Only with Sync.  Apparently they want you to work \"with the app\" to do whatever you want to do.  So the only way you could store photos is randomly, unless you want to sync all file/photos from your one mothership computer.  The only semi-solution is to email yourself whatever you want, then download the photos/files...which again will only be dumped in the \"saved photo\" generic file.  You can imagine the limitations with original file sizes.\n\nAnother key element to me is the lack of any tabbed browsing, whether in Safari or the special Bing app for the iPad [superior to Safari for most things].  So to actually write an email, while constantly switching between single browser pages etc. I'd find ridiculously cumbersome, not to mention that you can't resize ANY windows/apps at all.  You can only resize font/content within a given page.\n\nWhich brings me to the keyboard, or lack thereof.  I had no idea that the numeric/symbol part of the keyboard is ALWAYS separate from the alpha part, meaning that if you're ever entering alpha/numeric content, i.e. passwords, airline record #'s etc. you have to hit one key to show the number part, hit the number/symbol, then hit another key to reveal the alpha part again, and back and forth endlessly.  In addition, because there's no real tactile feel for the keys, and because the entry points are different for every program [where the browser bar is vs input for youtube etc] you're staring at the keyboard to make sure your fingers are in the right place, then having to look back up and find where it's going, then back down etc., which not only slows the process, but can give you a headache from your neck bobbing up & down, as well as the different light/contrast levels for the keyboard vs the rest of the screen.\n\nYes - I know that you can get a separate bluetooth keyboard, and that would solve some of it - but it also defeats some of the advantage of the form factor if you have to haul the 2 around everywhere you go.\n\nThis doesn't even address any particular program you may want to work on - just the physical/OS realities of trying to work with it at all.\n\nYes - scrolling through photos is very fast, and can be easily manipulated with your fingers.  Yes there are some very inventive apps out there that take advantage of finger-abilities, but what the finger giveth, it also taketh away when it comes to anything that requires content creation or precision.  I never expected it to do something like Photoshop, but to be this crippled wasn't in the cards either.\n\nThis should be marketed to generic users not comfortable with computers, and iPhone users who are used to--and don't want anything more than what their iPhone will already do.  The geeks that have championed it should be dismissed for misleading everyone, as they will always find workarounds, and have multiple devices anyway [macbook air/pro/imac etc].  They could just as easily make an Android phone/tablet work for them.\n\nThe strength of Apple is supposed to be it's user-friendliness, flexibility and support...with their advertising just teasing out a few of the myriad possibilities of the device.  In the iPad's case, I feel they did the opposite:  they oversold it's abilities, touting dual-core ships, 9x better graphics etc., when in fact none of that really matters at the only pace the interface allows.  [I got my mom a refurb original iPad, the first computer she can work - and there's little difference in most app performance]\n\nAt the direction of my local Genius Bar & Store Manager, I went in search of an app that could help with photo file/transfer, but I queried one of the best reviewed, \"PhotoSync\" to be sure they responded:\n\n\"PhotoSync can only transfer photos to the save photos folder. This restriction is made by Apple unfortunately. Third party developers are not allowed to create albums in the camera roll, save photos in other locations than the saved photos folder, or to delete photo from the camera roll.  All these features Apple reserves completely for itself.  We hope that this will change one day in a newer iOS version but at this point it is the only thing we can offer (though we would like to offer more).\"\n\nThat may be plenty for most others, but it's not for me.  I went back to see if I skipped parts of reviews that mentioned this, and no - i didn't.  Here's from Mossberg from WSJ...who runs down all the drawbacks, including poor-quality cameras etc., then says:\n\n\"there are two big omissions, one old and one new. The old one is that, like Apple's prior phones and tablets, the shiny new iPad 2 still won't play Adobe's Flash video in its built-in Web browser. This is a deliberate decision by Apple, and puts its devices at a disadvantage for some users when compared with Android tablets, which can play Flash, or say they will soon, albeit not always well.\n\nThe other omission has to do with cellular data. The iPad 2 can't use, or be upgraded to use, the new, faster 4G cellular-data networks being rolled out.\"\n\nNO mention of any of the aspects that are important to me, and I would think to a substantial number of people...even if we aren't a majority.\n\nI want it to be the Next Big Thing - the one that replaces laptops with a smaller, more flexible form factor that's also inspiring to use.\n\nI'm just left with the deflated feeling that I've been had, and mostly because of some very dumb and ridiculous failures in their OS that don't have to be that way...just sticking a finger in my eye as a dedicated Mac user.\n\n**Update** I got the 11\" Macbook Air and am very happy with it - although it is a lot more computer power than I needed in pure portable terms -  it isn't substantially bigger than the iPad [especially with keyboard] for those of you that can afford it."}

For instance, you are unable to watch showtimes on IMDB because of its weakness to install flash player.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "People need to be aware that the reviews you see for the iPad often reflect the old Mac/PC platform wars with some people making comments who simply don't like iPads from a distance, without actually owning one, because they see it as part of the deplorable Apple mania they find so distasteful.  They're entitled to their opinion, of course, but it is unfortunate they skew the evaluation of this product without the deep acquaintance one needs in order to give it an insightful evaluation.\n\nI have taught computer science at the college level for 26 years and have had computers with all kinds of operating systems. I don't own Apple stock and have never known anyone who works at Apple. I therefore have no connection to Apple.\n\nI have had my iPad for about a month and read a fair number of reviews before I purchased, spent some time using one at the store, and thought about what I might use one for, in contrast to my laptop with which I am well satisfied. People too often think of computers in terms of hardware, the specs and looks, instead of the software and the functionality.  You should ask yourself, \"What will I use this for that solves a problem I would like to have solved?\"  Software is always more important than hardware, even though it is the hardware that makes an impression.\n\nThe iPad is not a laptop and is not principally a production computer, that is, a computer on which you are going to develop web pages, do serious graphics editing, or write a book.  You could use your new Taurus to tow a trailer, but that is not what it is designed to do well. These things can increasingly be done on an iPad, but I don't believe they will ever be what it is best at.  It is a portable media machine with an inviting touch interface that requires a somewhat different set of skills, which take a modest amount of time to learn.  Surfing the web, checking email, watching movies, playing games, looking at new cars, reading the Economist magazine, all work better on an iPad than a laptop.  It does these things very well indeed. There are now 80,000 apps for a wide variety of activities--given its design intent.  The apps are either free or reasonably priced, so you can get a bunch from the \"app store\" for little investment. As with Amazon, you can see what other people think of an app before getting one.\n\nThis would be a splendid acquisition for small children, for teens deep into social networking, for an adult wanting to drop into the love seat for a quick look at what is happening in the world, for a senior citizen who wants a simple, inviting system with few hassles, to stay in touch with grandchildren.  The iPad is not a light laptop; it is instead a different way to use computing to do a wide variety of consumption and communication--not principally production.\n\nIn my experience, its wi-fi is adroit from one environment to another.  It \"knows\" where it is geographically, scans its environment for wi-fi, and accesses wi-fi seamlessly.  At this point in time, we should expect no less.  I cannot address the 3G communications since I have a wi-fi only (I am not convinced of the value of the 3G and I can use my phone as a hotspot).  I have never had it crash, though I have had to back myself out of apps that seemed to have no logical next step.  This was the result either of my ignorance or the fact that there is less of a standard user interface from app to app than there is in classical GUIs such as OS X and Windows.\n\nFor the laptop lugging road-warrior, it should be noted, this is not going to be a full replacement.  I now take my laptop and my iPad when I go into the college.  But much of the time there, I use my iPad because it is so light, convenient and useable. I use it to teach my classes and often reference traditional texts from the iPad instead of lugging them along to class. I develop my own web pages on my 27\" desktop which is the right environment for such development; I wouldn't expect to do that on an iPad.  In education (and evidently in medicine), it is proving to be a real boon.  The enterprise situations where portable information access and transmission are critical will find this a compelling solution.  The heavy Photoshop user or music track editor will still need a conventional computer, either laptop or desktop.\n\nI purchased the 64GB version, which may be more storage than I need. But since it will drive my 50\" screen downstairs I figured I would begin to load lots of pictures and favored music, so it may prove a wise choice in the long run.  It can swallow up entire evenings with the music-augmented slide shows it can do. In fact, you may begin to wonder if you need cable TV.  Conventional content providers should be worried about the iPad since it provides yet another way for the user to determine viewing experience. But if you are still drawn to cable, it makes a fine remote control.\n\nBefore people evaluate this new kind of computing, they need to spend a month or so with it to identify what it does well and what would be better left to other kinds of computing solutions. I fear some of the evaluations here (both glowing and critical) are not well informed and so do not serve the readers well.  So read these reviews with a critical eye.\n\nOctober 18 2011 Update:\n\nI continue to find my iPad remarkably productive and productive in ways I would not have anticipated. It does indeed redefine how we can use computing so that it does the work we want to do with minimal impediments.  I now leave my laptop at school and take my iPad back and forth since 80 or 90% of the time the iPad does all I need to do.  I use it 3 or 4 hours a day.\n\nI just ordered my wife an 11\" MacBook Air with the larger RAM and storage, which might seem to contradict what I said in my review.  I don't believe it does for the following reasons. She needs to do serious editing of Word documents for the volunteer work she does for the college and still wants the joys of a 2-pound piece of elegant hardware. She is an excellent typist and likes the feel of the Air's keyboard. A keyboard can be added to an iPad, but it's a kludgy add-on that compromises the point of the iPad: an ultra-light slim, touch-interface device that does most of what traditional computing does without the impediments of mouse and keyboard and weight.  The 11\" Air is a gem of engineering with many of the advantages of the iPad but it is more capable of the production I spoke of in my review since it is a full OS X Lion machine--so it is fully capable of running traditional production software such as Word or Photoshop or, for that matter, Windows.\n\nThe Air and the iPad illustrate the difference between a consumption device (iPad) and a production device (Air).  Much of what is appealing in the iPad can be had in the Air, but at the cost of an additional several hundred dollars. It's not the solution I want since I don't want the keyboard getting in the way when I want to curl up with a consumption device in my favorite love seat or use it to assist my teaching in class.  My wife prefers the Air since email and other typing-intensive production activities are so important to her. In a word, the iPad is distilled essence of computationally assisted consumption.\n\nI guess we will give the phrase \"mixed marriage\" new meaning!"}

I fell in love with my Iphone and just purchased an Ipad2 and it's amazing. It's crazy thin, it does everything I need it to.  I can answer email, listen to music, watch a video, surf the net, take notes (I love that function), as well a whole lotta other things.  I have even dropped it and it didn't shatter and it was fine.  It's pretty darn sturdy.  I love the fact the learning curve is so easy, and it's customizable.\n\nOkay this is an update - I have had my Ipad 2 now for six months and I still love it!  I order pretty much all my books for the Kindle application that's on the Ipad2, the games are amazing, I just ordered Bard's Tale and it's amazing!\n\nWill I buy an Ipad3, oh you bet I will, I can't wait to see what other products Apple comes out with."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I tried the original iPad and was not overly impressed.  I tried the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MOTOROLA-XOOM-Android-Tablet-Wi-Fi/dp/B0045FM6SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MOTOROLA XOOM Android Tablet (Wi-Fi)</a>&nbsp;and was happy enough until I tried this iPad 2.  I love this updated version!  The only issue I had was trying to decide which version to get since there are many options.\n\nStorage capacity can be 16 GB, 32 GB or 64 GB.  I would recommend at least the 32 GB since you cannot expand the storage and although apps do not take up much space, I was amazed at the amount of stuff I loaded onto my iPad (photos, movies, music, documents, etc.).  Trying to save some money, I wondered if I should get wi-fi only or the wi-fi/3G combination and with which service provider, AT&T or Verizon? Every iPad has wireless technology built in and automatically finds wi-fi networks easily but if you want to use it while traveling, the great outdoors or rural areas, wi-fi is not always an option.  If you have an iPhone 4, you can use it as a personal wi-fi hotspot for your iPad but your iPhone carrier might charge extra when this option is used.  Also, GPS is on the 3G models only, wi-fi provides an approximate location and this could be an issue if you love using Four Square or other GPS based applications.  More importantly, the wi-fi only model cuts your battery time down (~8 hours).  If you do choose wi-fi + 3G, I would check with AT&T or Verizon networks for pricing before deciding.  Both seem to provide reasonable costs for domestic usage but international usage is outrageous.  The previous iPad allowed any carrier to be used overseas (which is a bargain) but I'm not sure if AT&T and Verizon models allow for the same thing.\n\nThis new version is lighter, faster, slimmer and has slightly longer battery life at 10 hours.  I love the brilliant LED backlit display on the 9.7 inch screen.  I'm still not a fan of Pages (iWork) but it is possible to get Word documents on your iPad through iTunes.  There is no official Microsoft version but being able to download Word documents from my pc to the iPad and work on them makes a huge difference for me. I really love the technological improvements that allows this iPad to know your every move and be more responsive.  No matter how you rotate this iPad, the display self adjusts - even if you place it upside down!  It makes playing games like Critter Ball that much more fun to play and allows viewing movies or reading a book in any position.  Need I comment about Apple apps?  They beat the Android and every other market out there on this score and help make Apple products first choice.\n\nFor me, The only thing that prevents this tablet from being perfect is a better camera and the lack of Mozilla (I know this will never happen).  I have tried a lot of tablets and prefer this one over all others.  Yes, it is expensive but I consider it a good investment since it allows me to complete tasks on-the-go and help pass the time while waiting.  I think having this iPad along with an iPhone (or any smartphone) is the best combination.  Smartphones can provide information from the web but their small screen size can make viewing difficult and this iPad allows for a perfect union."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I received a black iPad 2 with 32 GB for my birthday from my lovely wife. It's a beautiful product, as with all other Apple products I have purcThe hased however.....the Wi-Fi capability is not so good. It works for a while and then stops working. I called Apple. They had me delete the password for my network and then put the password back in. It worked fine for a while...just as it did when I first installed it. But only for a while. I don't get it. I have a relatively new Belkin 2 wireless network on Cable and have been using it for several years. I have two laptop computers, two printers, and an iPod touch with Wi Fi. They all work just fine. I can work all day, every day on any of these devices from anywhere in my house or in my yard.\n\nBut not with the iPAD 2.\n\nwith the iPad 2 it works for a while and then stops working. Very frustrating.\n\nThis is not only a review but a request for help if anyone knows what's going on.\n\nBELOW IS A FOLLOW-UP ON MY IPAD2:\n\nBTW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ ALL OF THIS, HERE IS A QUICK SUMMARY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS:\n\n1. It never worked properly on my home network or other networks I tried at Starbucks, shopping centers, etc.\n2. It was too big and heavy.\n3. To read a book on it was a problems because it was heavy and just touching a little part of the screen caused pages to flip by very fast which meant I had to search for where I was about every few minutes.\n4. Even though I bought a 2 years warranty, sent it in for repair and eventually got a new/used one from Apple it still never solved any of the problems.\n5. Apple never would do anything substantive for me...like give me my money back or give me an Apple credit. So in the end I had to sell it for what I could get - $400, which meant I lost $250+plus the accessories, apps, the Warranty etc. I had spent.\n\nI am NOT an Apple basher and I enjoy my iPods (3) we have in our family. However, I'll never buy Apple again because of their \"return\" \"credit\" etc. policy. They have really made me unhappy with this experience and I did everything I could to work with them.\n\nI got an iPad2 with 32Gig memory ($599) + a \"magic cover\" ($60) from Loretta for my birthday this year. The \"magic cover\" is magnetic. It covers and protects the screen of the iPad2 when you're not using it and turns the machine on and off by putting the cover on and off. I also bought an $80 2-year warranty service. So all in all, without tax and shipping, we spent about $720 for the thing. The short story is the iPad2 didn't work for me. It wouldn't stay connected to our network. Every time I wanted to use it I had to go through the network settup process all over again. Apple Customer Service was no help. After hours with them I sent it in for \"repair.\" I got it back and it worked exactly the same, which is to say, it didn't work exactly as it didn't work before I sent it in. I kept asking for my money back or a credit but they kept refusing. Finally I sent it to them and they sent me a \"new\" (i.e. new to ME) unit. That's right, they did NOT say they would give me a new iPad2. They said they would give me a \"refurbished\" unit. I thought this was crappy since I'd only owned the thing for a month and had spent most of that time on the phone with their service department. Anyway, I got a \"new\" unit and it worked the same...i.e. it didn't work. Again, they refused to give me my money or a credit. So I finally just sold it. I got $400 for it so we lost about $350 (with shipping and tax).\nBesides not hooking up to our network, it was also big and heavy and no fun to sit and read books or browse the web or do any of the things I wanted it for. Reading a book, for example was a hassle. You had to hold this big heavy thing by the very edge of the \"frame\" because if you touched the screen anywhere it would flip through pages FAST and I spent most of my time trying to find where I left off. A real pain.\nApart from all of that, the iPad2 is beautiful, has a beautiful screen and presents a beautiful, rich, colorful picture of whatever you're viewing. But not that much better than my Dell laptop.\nBy the way, I KNOW our network works. It's the most recent Belkin WAP2 system and it works flawlessly with both of our Dell laptops, our DELL wireless color printer and our Brother wireless Laser Printer. I also had an Apple iPod Touch which worked perfectly using our same Wireless network. So it HAD to be something in the iPad2 that just didn't work. Anyway, I don't think I'll buy anything more from Apple, mainly because that even when something doesn't work right out of the box they won't give your money back or even give you a credit.\nWhat I DID buy and am very happy with, is an Amazon Kindle Latest Generation Wi Fi for $140 + $60 for a leather cover with built in reading light which actually works.\nThe networking on the Kindle works great...just like our Dell Laptops and our printers.\nFor more money, you can get a Kindle with not only Wi Fi but also 3G, so it will work using your phone network as well as your home network. We didn't need that feature though.\nThe Kindle is great for reading books, magazines, newspapers, etc. You can get thousands of free books, but current books, or subscriptions to periodicals will cost you. If I was still traveling I'd get the 3G and subscribe to the NY Times but I can't read all of the news I want to (which isn't much) on my computer.\nWhat I do like, is reading books on the Kindle. You can set up your machine with the font, font size, number of words per line, etc. etc. so that everything you read is the same in terms of those features.\nYou can shop for books at Amazon from your computer or from your Kindle using the Wi Fi or 3G system.\nIt's black and white, but that's OK with me.\nIt's small and light weight and very easy to use.\nThe leather cover with built in light is a really nice feature. The light works off of the Kindle battery, which lasts about a month and charges up in less than an hour.\nReading in bed, the light shines only on the Kindle page so it doesn't bother anyone else in bed with you.\nI've got about 100 books on my Kindle right now. All of them I got free from either Amazon or Gutenberg. When you \"buy\" from Gutenberg or some other free source you just download the file (in Kindle format) and email it to a special email address you get which is then on Amazon.\nAnytime you turn on your Kindle it automatically downloads whatever you've bought from Amazon or sent to Amazon from where you bought it.\nIt also does audio books and works the same way with those. However, you have to plug in earphones of course, to listen.\nIt holds 3500 books, so I've got plenty of room left.\nAnyway, if you're interested in an \"eReader\" I can recommend the Kindle over the iPad2.\nIf you're interested in something with which to browse the web, I say, stick to a laptop.\nI know Apple makes some beautiful products, but I think the iPad2 is a flop for what I wanted to use it for.\nI think it's great for playing games on or looking at photos or maybe even watching a movie (after you've downloaded it) but I wouldn't want to try to watch a movie using \"streaming\" because of the networking issue."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "My primary reason to buy an iPad was both work and home use. At work I wanted to stop printing the powerpoint decks and reports to read, and just read them on an iPad in meetings/on the go. For home I was tired of not being able to get to all my magazines and never having them on me when I wanted to read them. I also wanted to watch some TV/movies in bed/around the home so that I did not have to switch on the big living room TV. The iPad 2 has been a perfect solution for all these and more. I'm kicking myself that I went with the lowest 16GB version as I find myself downloading more content and apps everyday! It's not a laptop/desktop replacement either at home or work, but it's a great media consumption device and more.\n\nI already used my iPhone 4 constantly due to the multitude of apps and games available for it. Fewer apps are available for iPad but it's still thousands, and I have already downloaded 200+ to try, most of them free.\n\nThe hardware itself is very slick. Very light so you can hold it in one hand, especially if you use a cover - otherwise it tends to be slippery. But it's not so much about the hardware, which other reviews have detailed anyway. It's all about being able to do what you want to do with a device. With the best technology the device itself should disappear and allow you to create, read, connect - whatever it is you want to do. That's what iPad 2 is doing for me, like a netbook never could. Using it is so intuitive and seamless, that despite having the iPhone 4, I am amazed with how much more I can do to be productive. I regret not buying it sooner!\n\nLike the previous devices Apple has created the genius is in the apps available for it. The PressReader apps allows me to read newspapers and magazines from all over the world. I can now read some favorite magazines that were so difficult to get in the print version and newspapers too. Apps like the Flipboard and Zite make magazine content come alive. Favorite magazines like Bloomberg Businessweek and Wired are available free as iPad versions to print subscribers. Also, all news magazines are now featuring interactive content, so I'm reading the news article and looking at static images, and then just as easily click on a video to watch it. The Daily is a good interactive made for newspaper but I'm looking for even better interactive journalism!\n\n\"The Civil War\" shows us what history books of future should look like with its interactive content and a daily log of events as they happened 150 years ago. Netflix streams nicely and I can watch the content I want to that bore my family to tears - like documentaries. I also download all my PDF reading materials on it and can read and annotate and highlight. Powerpoints are so easy to read and I can scale the screen to look at the graphs better. iMovie is so simple to use, and I've already created several home movies with music and subtitles. GarageBand is great for novices like me, it has a multitude of instruments that I can play and even has smart versions to create music. With penultimate and UPad I've been trying to completely do away with paper notepads, but that's not the perfect solution yet.\n\nWith apps like Dropbox and Box you can drop your files into the cloud and access them from your iPad. Chatting over FaceTime or over Webex is simple, although it's entirely dependent on bandwidth. With other apps you can access your remote desktop and use every program on your computer or pull any file. I am using TeamViewer which is free for individuals to log into my home PC from work and check my files or run some programs remotely. It shows you your PC screen on your iPad and you drag your finger to move the mouse cursor and click. It's pretty seamless once you set it up, as simple as opening the app. I opened it one day from work to see my kid watching Youtube and surprised her at dinner when she told me she had been doing home work (ha!).\n\nAnother made for iPad app I use a lot is the Tivo Remote. When I turn it on it automatically shows the program I'm currently watching on the iPad screen with more details and upcoming episodes. I can use the remote buttons or explore like programs, set my season passes, etc. And when I'm not home I can use it to record programs remotely. Xfinity from Comcast also allows you to schedule and watch your onDemand content. HBO GO is simply a delight, I am thrilled to have all the HBO shows available to me anywhere I go!\n\nI have been reading much more since I got iPad 2. Especially blogs, magazines and newspapers. That alone makes it worth it for me. And it's SO much easier to stream content like TED Talks, Lectures from YouTube, movies from Crackle and Netflix. I would have never wanted to sit down with my heavy and hot laptop for such prolonged periods to watch this content. There are some fun games available too, and every day more apps get launched which make me wonder how did I manage without this before!\n\nFacetime has been fun too. There are Qik (from Skype) and Tango, and several other apps available that will let you do video chat but since Facetime is integrated with email, you can just click on a contact's name and choose to connect through FaceTime. I can not only check on my kid on video through this feature (all they need is an iPod Touch and wireless) but also connect with friends overseas for free. And I can click their pics while they're on the call with me. Again this feature is dependent on video quality but as a multi-tasking mom it's been great to be able to connect any time in video from work to home. My kid will be listening to music on her iPod Touch and my FaceTime call comes in - and we're off talking face to face. VLC Player has been a great app to watch .avi and other videos. I had slightly lower res version of a TV series in AVI format and the VLC player allowed me to watch it on iPad, I prefer that screen to my HP Pavilion 17 inch which has worse resolution and tends to get too hot in my lap anyway\n\nBattery life was a big surprise for me. Mine lasts 10-11 hours on the WiFi model with full usage. That is amazing, I never carry the charger as it goes 2 days without charging. Love it! None of my laptops can compare!\n\nThe frustrations I experienced with the iPad 2 was its inability to play Flash, which will not come any time soon due to Steve Job's dislike of that technology. However, a genius of an app called iSwifter has found a way to run flash on iPad 2 and I have been using it to watch video on websites that have flash content. However, it's still not as seamless as I would like it to be! The other is a more seamless way to store and organize photos and files. I can do this through apps but why not make this more seamless. If I have to delete photos there should be a select all feature to delete a whole folder.\n\nIf you're on the fence about buying an iPad 2 go ahead and make the leap, you won't regret it. If you already have an iPad then hold on for iPad 3 as this version gives you some enhancements (faster, improved graphics, thinner, cameras) but nothing that is so extraordinary that you can't wait another few months!"}

It was amazing for the first 20 hours. The apps were so unbelievable. I have a touch, and it is so much better. On the second day, it started trying to shut down. The battery was at 80%. I tried shutting it off and could not. I called apple. I bought the extra care plan for 90 dollars so they are going to help me. Right? Wrong. The first representative we talked to had us restore it to the factory settings. It took 1 hour to download the 660 mg file. We then restored it to the factory settings. It started working perfectly. We were so happy. The problem was solved! I watched videos and played with it for hours. I ran the battery down and plugged it in overnight to charge. The next morning the problem was back in spades. It then started doing new things like flashing on and off. I went on the website and asked a specialist to call me again. She put me on hold. She was gone for a little while. When she came back, she said that I needed to mail it back to them to REPAIR it. I said What? I have the apple care plan and was told that you would send me a replacement. I have not even had this thing 2 days. She said that the other representative lied to me, and that she could not lie to me. I have 2 options. I can take it to the Apple Store (nearest one 165 miles away) or I can mail it and have it repaired and they will send the same one back to me. She made me an appointment at the store. I am driving the 165 miles to take it back. The second representative (a supervisor) told me that they would send me a replacement if I gave them a credit card and let them charge another 900 dollars for it. When they received the old one back, they would charge it back to me.\n\nI have had a kindle for years. The day I saw it on the Oprah show was the day I fell in love with it. I bought one the same day. The first kindle i received was great except the internet would not work. I called Amazon and they shipped me out a kindle the SAME DAY! I got it a couple of days later and loved it. It worked perfectly. I upgraded to a DX and have never had a problem.\n\nIf you want to see a video of what it is doing, you can go to you tube and watch it. My username is caulret. I love Amazon and their amazing customer service!\n\nEdited 4-16-11\nI took it back to the Apple store. The people at the Plano Apple store were awesome. They did not want to give me my money back, but we negotiated with them and they ended up putting it back on our credit card with some creative measures. A more timid person would have had to take an apple gift card. This was all they said that they could do at first, but I held my ground.  I might buy this product again at a local Best Buy when they come available. If I decide to do that, I will edit this review. This was my true experience, and I wanted to share it."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I love my new iPad2! But I was very disappointed with the included accessories. The USB cable is frustratingly short. The iPad seems to need more power than my USB ports provide, so it won't charge that way. Therefore I have to plug it into the wall, and the ~3ft cord isn't long enough to have the iPad on my desk or in hand while it's charging. I currently have my iPad sitting on the floor in my office so it can charge. Not a very useful location!\n\nThe USB outlet connector is also frustratingly designed. It has so much mass above and below the prongs that, when plugged into a power strip, it covers outlets on both sides of the one it's plugged into. It's nice that the prong set comes off (to make it interchangeable for sale in other countries or for travel, I assume), but a rotating prong would have been helpful. Other products I've bought have had that basic usability.\n\nOverall I gave this review 4 stars. I love the iPad itself, but I can't easily use it the way I want to without purchasing additional accessories, such as a longer USB cable."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "We are now the proud owners of two (2) iPad 2 tablets.  We have one white 64GB WiFi/AT&T 3G and one black 16GB WiFi.\n\nMy family all pooled together to buy my son his iPad 2 (after they saw how he was responding to my 3G version).  Unlike many children with autism, my son has never been very computer or technologically inclined.  His interests have always been with physical and tangible objects and interests (not a bad thing, at all)... but we strongly suspected that the iPad touchscreen would change all of that.\n\nThere are some remarkable apps for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) - some of which (fortunately) we don't need to use, since my son is very verbal.  That having been said - I have watched how the iPad is completely transforming the lives of his peers who are not very verbal.  Since this isn't a review of the apps, I won't write a whole book about the great apps - except to highlight three that perform really well on the iPad for my son:  1) the \"First Then\" schedule - you can use stock photos, photos you take, or grab them from Google images; 2) Stories2Learn where you can make your own social stories using photos you take; and \"Look in My Eyes\" a game that makes your child look squarely into the eyes of images of children (there is a secret number displayed) that needs to be entered on a next page to get \"prizes\".\n\nOkay - so now a review of the iPad itself...\n\nFor the 64GB wifi/3G model - I swore I would only use it for my son and myself... that I wouldn't get sucked into using it for work (since I am the one who paid for it... right?).  Okay, well that plan lasted all of 3 minutes.  I have all of the attachments now: the VGA connector (used it yesterday to put maps up on the wall during a meeting using our projector); the HDMI connector (which is genius - since it has a 2nd port to provide power using your own AC adapter - and I use this at home and at work to plug into the TVs/LCD displays); the USB and SD Card reader (which imports my photos from my Nikon DSLRs); and my sister bought me the bluetooth keyboard (which I thought would be superfluous - but since I AM actually using this for work ALL OF THE TIME - it comes in very handy).  All of the Apple attachments work great.  Yesterday, I received a cheap non-Apple 2100 mAmp car charger from Amazon - and it works GREAT.  Charges, and I'm not afraid of my iPad battery frying!\n\nSo, let me get to the two negatives - since that's why YOU are reading this review - right?  You want to figure out what is wrong with this thing... if anything.  The honest truth is that the cameras STINK!!!  Totally, and completely.  So, why give it a 5 star review, right?  The cameras WORK for the purpose that I wanted:  to use facetime to call my sister who lives overseas... and for that - it works passibly well.  Not in low light.  NEVER in low light.  So... I adjust.  Don't call Asia with the lights off!  Problem solved, solution found!  Trying to take photos with the front or back camera - also not great.  REALLY HORRIBLE in the low light conditions I just mentioned.  YET - when you take photos outside in the sunshine - they are actually quite decent.  I'm a photo snob, though - so nothing that didn't come from one of the Nikon DSLRs is suspect to me... DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE HOPING THIS WILL REPLACE YOUR COMPACT DIGITAL CAMERA.  My Blackberry phone camera is a million times better - and I still think that THAT stinks.\n\nWhile I'm on the subject - let's talk about Facetime.  Apple - it's a great product.  I really love it.  HATE that I can't use it on my iMac at home unless I upgrade to Snow Leopard - which I have no intention of doing.  Glad my son now has his own iPad 2 so that I can call him when I'm at work or on the road... So others who are reading this understand - the Facetime App is a billion times better than the Skype app.  Apple made Facetime to work on their computers.  Period.  As such, it takes those not-so-great cameras I just mentioned, and maximizes their abilities and functionality.  If you can call someone Mac to Mac - use Facetime.\n\nWhat else don't I like:  the cost of all of those add ons I mentioned.  Seriously!?!?  My choice to buy them.  I will stop my rant.\n\nWhat I HATE:  the smartcover.  It's horrible.  Don't waste your money on the smart cover!  It's not smart.  I bought the orange - and it's already dirty in the ridges (remember I take this everywhere, and to work... and I work as a project engineering overseeing large dirty and messy job sites) - but the orange was already a sick creamsicle color, but it is just lame.  It doesn't always \"snap\" to the edge with the precision shown in the video commercial.  Just buy something else.  Or save your money.  I am waiting for the Otterbox Defender to come out - since I now realize how much I will travel with this.\n\nEverything else - I love.  The list is long, and I won't bore you.  As a child, I dreamed of such a device... and it meets almost all of my desires and wishes for a non-human user interface.  The AT&T 3G is good enough, don't know if Verizon would have been better... I will always question my decision.  I can watch Netflix - but it doesn't hold coverage on my trainride... but then again, my cell phone from Verizon doesn't either.  There are lots of \"dead zones\" on my train ride to work.  When I'm stationary - in the woods, at a restaurant, in a store - the AT&T signal is typically strong enough to handle the most demanding streaming.\n\nVisually, this object is a stunner.  Physically, this object is a winner:  it feels great in your hands, is responsive to the touch, and it makes everyone want one...\n\nI recommend that anyone who has time on their hands buy one.  If you don't have time on your hands, don't buy one, since you will never sleep..... that is my woe..."}

About 2 weeks ago I had a heart attack and my Dr. Told me that I need to have a 1000 cal diet and work out a lot more.  Well I couldn't use my phone for the calory counting, too small.  Well I decided to buy iPad 2 and I was angry, but I knew I needed one for ONE reason is to count calories.  I've had it for about a week now, and I LOVE IT.  I really can't leave with ought it anymore. iPad 2 really is saving my life, with the apps to count my cal, my workout programs, and even my Dr. Can see what I eat and what I do at the gym.  I'm not going to talk about how cool it is to serf the web, and do business on it...  I have a 16 g white iPad.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have purchased both an iPad2 and Xoom for different family members.  I thought it worth comparing the two devices for anyone interested.  Many of my comments are subjective so bear that in mind when reading the review.\n\nExternal appearance and feel:\nThe iPad2 screen has a different feel from the Xoom screen - the iPad2 is a bit slicker, less likely to stick when moving short distances.  The screen on the Xoom tends to show fingerprints more than the Ipad2 for some reason. Everyone in this family thinks that the iPad2 looks sharper than the Xoom.\n\nBoth weigh 1.6 lbs.  Subjectively, the Xoom feels heavier than the Ipad2, but it's an illusion perhaps caused by it's slightly smaller size.  UPDATE:  I need to learn to use the scales - the Xoom is about 3 ounces heavier than the iPad2.\n\nBoth have a similar size screen, measured diagonally.  But the aspect ratio is different - 4:3 for iPad2, 16:9 for Xoom.  This means that the iPad2 actually has a larger viewing area, and this makes a real difference when scrolling through a web site.  The iPad2 screen is brighter than the Xoom screen.\n\nHardware performance:\nThe Xoom feels a bit faster than the iPad2, and the specs show that it is faster.  Both have dual core processors based on ARM designs.  The Xoom seems to be able to handle graphics better than the iPad2.  As far as connecting to Wifi networks, both seem to have this one down pat - they both just work.\n\nUser Interface:\nThe iPad2 is just like a big iPhone.  Whether this good or bad is subjective.  For me, it's good - polished, flexible and can be customized to my needs.  The Xoom user interface is totally new, and unfortunately it shows - there are many rough edges.  Some examples: moving icons around to group programs together is not intuitive and they keep moving back; you can see the first 5 applications running on the Xoom and select one, but the list doesn't scroll so applications that don't show in the list can't be selected; you can't close applications (except by a force quit that can lose data) as the Xoom decides when to quit an application; customization is possible but more difficult than the iPad2.  In short, the Xoom user interface is a work in progress - great potential but currently quite flawed.\n\nOperating System:\nThe iPad2 uses Apple's IOS.  It works, but it uses cooperative multitasking which (in theory) is less effective than the full multitasking on the Xoom which uses a version of Google's Android designed for tablets.  In practice, they both work fine and I doubt anyone would notice the difference.\n\nApplications:\niPad2 has 70,000 apps available from the Apple App store and it also runs the 300,000 apps available for the iPhone.  Xoom currently has around 60 apps and it can run Android phone apps (but they are stretched in one direction which makes them look strange).  Some of the iPad2 applications are pretty impressive - GarageBand for example.  There are many games on the iPad2, and just a few games made for the Xoom.  If this doesn't improve quickly, the Xoom is sunk.  After all, applications are generally the reason people buy these devices.\n\nBrowsing:\nBecause of the screen aspect ratio that I mentioned, I prefer browsing on the iPad2.  The Xoom has Adobe Flash and the iPad2 doesn't, but so far I haven't come across a single instance where this has been an issue.  I'm sure there are very many sites not compatible with iPad2, but I haven't browsed to one of them yet.\n\nCamera:\nI don't use the camera much, and I'm not really sure if either is better.  In the family, the Xoom owner says the Xoom is better, the iPad2 owner says the iPad2.  The Xoom has flash and iPad2 doesn't which is a win for Xoom, but the Xoom seems slower to take a picture.\n\nSpeakers:\nThe Xoom has two small speakers, iPad2 has one slightly larger speaker.  The sound is somewhat better quality on the iPad2 and the Xoom cannot achieve the same volume as the iPad2.  But they are both pretty poor - use earphones or an external speaker if you want decent audio.\n\nBattery life:\nDifficult for me to give an exact comparison, but based on family usage it seems the iPad2 has the edge here, but not by much.\n\nInternal storage:\nThe Xoom has 1GB of RAM and 32 GB of flash storage.  The iPad2 has 512MB of RAM and 16GB, 32GB or 64GB of flash storage - I bought the 64GB model.\n\nExternal storage:\nThe Xoom has an external card slot that supports SD cards, but the software was not ready in time for the product release.  The slot is inoperative until Motorola releases an operating system update.  The iPad2 has no external storage support.\n\nUser Experience:\nThe iPad2 was up and running quite quickly.  I connected the device to iTunes and it automatically updated to the latest version of the operating system.  I was then able to select and download Apps immediately and start using them.\n\nThe Xoom was not so easy.  For some reason, I was not able to install the latest version of Google Maps or Adobe Flash.  I was able to download the apps, and the install process appeared to work without errors, but the new apps just were not installed.  After some time trying I finally returned the Xoom back to the factory settings and started again, and this time both the installs worked.  Of course, this wouldn't be a good solution if you had a ton of applications and/or data on the device.\n\nSupport:\nApple has their retail stores.  You can get a huge amount of help from these stores from people whose only job is to support users.  Both iPad2 and Xoom users have web sites available that support their products but you have to spend the time digging for the sites and digging through the sites.  You can also purchase an Applecare support package which gives you a couple of years extra support for the iPad2.\n\nBottom line:\nI believe the Xoom hardware may be slightly better than the iPad2 (apart from the screen aspect ratio and the speakers), but the software is terribly lacking.  The Xoom was released FAR too early, it's just not ready for primetime.\n\nIf I had to pick just one, I'd pick the iPad2 - less hassle, apps for everything, better browsing experience, better support options.  The Xoom needs less buggy software and more applications; it has potential but it's not there yet.  And by the time it gets there, there will be something better available.\n\nUpdate 7/5/2011\n\nWe have now had the two devices for over 3 months.  During that time Motorola released an update to fix some of the issues with the original Xoom.  It's somewhat faster, the problem of only seeing the first 5 applications is fixed, there are some extra capabilities for USB, and most importantly, the Xoom doesn't crash every few hours.\n\nHowever, the biggest issue with the Xoom is still the number of applications available to run in native tablet mode, as opposed to running Android phone applications.  I've read that there are 300 applications available, but it's hard to find them.  The Android Market doesn't distinguish between phone applications designed for a small screen  and tablet applications.  You have to read the description of each application to see what it is designed to run on, and finding 300 apps in 200,000 is very time consuming.  Apple claims to have 100,000 iPad specific apps in their store.\n\nAnother problem with the Android Market is the complete lack of supervision.  I understand that anybody can put any application there without any review, and I've read there have been a few problems with malware.  Recently I saw an article that claimed there are spyware applications on the store, which worries me a little.  I'm not saying you can't get malware from the Apple store, but Apple does look at the apps first - I'm not aware of any malware getting into the Apple store.\n\nThe iPad2 does have some downsides I wasn't aware of when I wrote my review.  It would be nice to have a general purpose USB connection and a card slot.  There is an extra-cost adapter available from Apple that supplies HDMI out and a limited function USB connector.  Also the keyboard attachment made for the original iPad doesn't work on the iPad2.\n\nFor us, the iPad2 is the winner.  The Xoom is sitting on a shelf and I don't think it's been used over a week now.  In contrast, iPad2 is in use every day and continues to be a big hit.  The primary problem with the Xoom is the lack of tablet-based applications.\n\nUpdate 7/7/2011\n\nThe Xoom has been sold to a colleague who wants an Android tablet.  I think the Xoom is better than most of the Android tablets currently available.  However, the Honeycomb software feels so unfinished, and the paucity of available tablet-based applications was a major issue.  I lost several hundred dollars on the sale, but nobody wanted to use it and there was no point in letting it lay around unused.  I'm already under some pressure to buy another iPad2, but I want to wait to see if the rumors of another iPad version in September are true."}

I loved the original iPad and felt Apple was really going to knock my socks off (and the onslaught of Android tablets) with it's new and improved tablet. To say the least i was completely underwhelmed.\n\nThe cameras may as well not even be there! The quality is aweful on both the front and the back. Apple made up for this by putting facetime software that is extremely sluggish on the I2! The main reason i got the I2 was to communicate with my wife and kids on facetime on her iPhone...\n\nThe new design (although impossibly thin and light) is very difficult to hold. The edges are kinda pointed  and its thinness leaves me feeling like it's going to slip out of my hands. The original I pad was one of the most ergonomically friendly devices ever made.\n\nThe performance (processor) isn't even noticeably different than the original. Don't try to comment and tell me \"well, the clock speed is actually blah, blah, blah...\" garbag! When I put it next to my wife's original and we load up the same apps and webpages its hardly different and in most cases no different. My wife laughed hard at me when i waiting ALL day for this dissapointing \"upgraded tablet\" and laughed even harder when hers performs just the same!\n\nIt's frustrating when you realize your favorite company hyped an inferior product this way. I'll NEVER walk away from Apple cause their quality is second to NONE. However, Apple lost this customer for good on tablets. I sold mine four days ago and got a Xoom WiFi and haven't put it down since."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Great unit, but be aware, the cameras, even the better, forward-facing one--really bite. Why they couldn't use the camera from the current iPhone, which is quite good, on this $500+ product, is beyond me. It is a huge flaw in an otherwise mostly outstanding beast.  On a more minor note, the Apple tendency to design for profit instead of ease of use is always maddening. Case in point:  The built in memory costs $100 for each additional 16GBs.  My (non-iPhone) phone has a removable mini SD card that cost $9 for 16 GB, and I can add memory at will, for very little money. This could easily have been the Apple approach with the iPhone & iPad. A mini SD is the size of a fingernail. So I still buy Apple products because they are so good in so many ways, but the affordability thing is kind of ridiculous. Their computers are better than PCs, no question, but should not cost fully twice to three times what a comparable PC costs."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "If you're deciding whether or not to buy an iPad 1 or iPad 2, you may want to read this first.  I've had an iPad 1 for 9 months.  Before I bought it, I doubted how much I would use it.  It had no hard drive, USB connectors, DVD player, camera, full keypad, ability to load major business software apps, ability to play flash-developed graphics, and it did not have much storage and memory space.  I wondered how it could be useful to me, since I had many Apple products - Mac Pro, Macbook Pro, iPhone, Mobile Me, Airport, Time Capsule, etc.\n\nTo my delight the iPad provided 100x my wildest expectations.  Once you start using it for searching the Web and researching just about everything you do, you realize how much more you can get out of the Web and Internet every day.  You begin making tons of use of the Web and it makes you become way more productive in life (home, autos, service providers, education, children, parenting, illness, job, professionally, etc., etc., etc.).  It ends up becoming an extension of your hand, mind, and life.  It doesn't take you over, it merely helps you with everything you do.\n\nEmail is also a different experience using an iPad.  You find yourself no longer reading email on your phone or computer.  You end up having your iPad with you, no matter where you are.  Email is extremely easy to read and is organized in way never thought possible.  I bring it in stores, theaters, healthcare providers, hair salon, work, lunch, and e v e r y w h e r e !!  it's way too easy to use and to make you much more productive.\n\nAll this, and I haven't even gotten to the thousands of extremely useful and productive apps, movies, podcasts, music, etc., available (via iTunes).  You can have every type of app, from sophisticated business intelligence dashboard software to first class presentation software, to science, astronomy, and tons of world-class games.  All in addition to the new extension to your brain and hand (mentioned above).  So, don't get hung up about USBs, DVDs, and hard disks.  You can get a VGA cable, external camera connection cable, and a myriad of cases and multi-use devices.  You will not even want your regular computer after a month.  iPad 2 brings us to a new level, with two cameras, 2x the speed, thinner/lighter, and great new OS features.  If you try an iPad for 30 days, you will never want tp be without it.  I do not sell iPads and I have NO affiliations with Apple or their resellers.  Load the Auryn Ink app and use a Nomad brush.  You'll swear you were really painting on a canvas.\n\nTransformed from iPad slayer to iPad bigot."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "After playing around with it, I have to agree with previous reviews. The only thing I would add is the fact that store managers pointed out to me that the only way to do webcam is using Facetime. This is not true at all. I downloaded the yahoo messenger app and was able to do webcam with yahoo users on Windows PCs. For Ebook readers it is an awesome device. It has all the features of a Nook and if you turn the Ipad sideways (landscape) it will show both side of the pages as if you were reading a real book. I also like the graphics on the way the pages flip."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I purchased the original iPad 64GB with Wifi back in October of last year.  If I had know that an updated model was going to become available so soon, I would have waited for the iPad 2. So, do you really need the iPad 2?  Frankly, there are three major differences between the original iPad and the iPad 2.  First, the iPad 2 is noticeably lighter and sleeker.  It is more comfortable to hold for longer periods of time, especially if you like to read e-newspaers or ebooks. Secondly, the iPad 2's processor is a lot speedier.  Page turns are quick, boot time is fast, and surfing the internet is a breeze. Last of all, the iPad 2 has a camera. This, however, is its weakest feature. Do not expect the same results you would get from a digital camera or digital webcam. (I could have lived with a model that has no camera.) The other differences are minor (e.g., the automatic turn on/turn off feature). For me, the iPad 2 is a better product for what I needed (reading and surfing the net).  Before you get rid of your original iPad, I would check it out at a retail store along side your original."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Really people? For the money this thing is stripped down. They just now add a forward and back facing camera and everyone is like ooh cool. This feature has been on cell phones forever. It should of been added on the original ipad. Think about it. A cell phone has more features than an ipad. Smartphones now have high resolution front and rear facing cameras with flash, able to use the flash as a flashlight, sd card slots, cable hook up to t.v's, wifi, usb, physical keypads, can download music without proprietary software, and so on. All in one little package. Now don't tell me they don't have room on an ipad to add any features.\n\nYes they made this a little lighter and a little faster. But for the price you can buy a powerful laptop or netbook that will leave the ipad 2 in the dust. And you won't have to pay for proprietary cables or accessories for dowloading your pictures, files, music etc. like the camera kit, which doesn't work for all cameras or memory cards to transfer pictures. And don't forget you have to pay for all the Mac apps. And oh you want a physical keyboard? More money. Wait you better buy a protective case to protect your new investment that probably is adding up to almost a grand now. That's where Apple gets you. You have to buy their proprietary products and services. And they will add features and memory upgrades a little at a time to newer models so you will want the latest features. Just like their ipods and itouches.\n\nIf you are thinking about replacing a computer with this, then read on. If not, then read elswhere.\n\nAll that said...if you want to do work on it, consider getting a loaded netbook which is a better value and more powerful, more memory and you don't have to go through the hassle of downloading or uploading to another computer like you would have with an ipad. With a netbook you can just load data onto an sd card or thumb drive if you want to instantly. What if you don't have a computer around with an ipad and you want to transfer some files or pictures onto it or want to just download some files and take it with you on a thumb drive. Oh wait did you remember to bring the cables or adapter with you on top of that? Do you want adapters protuding from your expensive ipad waiting to be bumped and snapped off? Also do you use Windows or Mac? Is your printer cabable of over the air printing? If not then you have to either get a capable printer or transfer the data onto a computer that is hooked up to your printer. If it were not for the touchscreen, would anyone buy an ipad? HECK NO! It would be considered a featurless outdated piece of equipment comparable to something about 10 plus years ago. See where i'm going here. But on the same note, a netbook is not as portable. So weigh out your wants and needs. I ended up getting a netbook after research and playing with them and no regrets because I can do anything on it and it is a spare because the kids take up the other computer. I couldn't of done much with the ipad except surf the web. Example, my wifes work computer crashed and she was working from home. Well luckily she had the netbook because she hooked up the netbook to her lcd monitor and logged into a computer at her work place remotely and kept on working. And I also had the netbook hooked up another time to my flatscreen, an external hard drive, mouse, and an sd card in the slot so I could edit pictures, back them up and print them. I also had an extra usb port to spare where I could of had a phone plugged in to charge at the same time my netbook was charging also. Couldn't of done all this with an ipad let alone charge it at the same time if you had something plugged into it's single proprietary port. Get at least an 11.6 inch netbook if you decide on one and still want functionality and portability. Everything fits on the screen better and not crammmed in. Keep in mind though that some netbooks come with just Windows starter and not a full working edition. If you don't get the full working edition, then the netbook would not be of much use. But oh when I just want to lounge around and surf the web, I wish I had a tablet. But I use my phone for that, lame but it works. Oh yeah, I can tether my phone to the netbook also.\n\nPersonally I think this is mainly usefull for surfing the web or used as an electronic organizer for someone on the move who has to keep track of a lot of information or carries a clipboard i.e. invoices, work orders, short note taking, etc. or needs visual images out in the field. But to use in place of a real computer, no. You can buy apps. for the ipad to do some work on, but they are not as powerful. So think about what you want or need it for. Ask yourself something like this. Do you need something portable for school where you can do term papers and homework on, or for organizing and socializing? This is not a replacement for a computer if that's what you want. It is a media device with limitations features wise. Also with a netbook you can have a spare battery and swap it out and continue on. With an ipad you have to plug it in and wait for it to charge and it defeats the purpose of mobility doesn't it? Yes you ipad defenders, I know the battery charge lasts pretty long, but there are variables affecting it like what you are running and what if you forgot to plug it in overnight and you don't have time to charge it.\n\nI'm not saying a tablet doesn't have it's place because it does. And yes I know that an ipad and a netbook are two different things. But it may not serve your needs so be aware. I can see where an ipad or any other tablet would be more practical or even a no brainer because a clamshell design of a netbook might be just to clunky. I'm just pointing out the lack of features on the ipads. If they only would add a memory card slot or standard usb to make it simple to transfer data or so I can hook up other peripherals. I don't want to pull out cables or turn on my computer and sync it everytime I want to transfer data. But don't hold your breath. They want you to buy another one with more memory if you need more. A memory slot or usb would give you the option of adding more memory of your own. And it won't take you long to fill up the little memory the ipad offers if you like to load media onto it.\n\nSize and price should be taken into consideration if you want to use it for entertainment away from home a lot. There are several tablets offered from competitors now and some are less expensive, more features, smaller and lighter and don't use a lot of proprietary cables or software applications or hardware, they have sd slots and or usb also. Something you might want to think about if you like to dowload or upload stuff on the fly and travel light. But it comes down to you to research ask questions and try to get some hands on to \"see what works best for you\". Just don't expect that all the tablets perform the same or offer the same apps. Your not going to get ipad performance or huge selection of apps. to choose from compared to a tablet that costs way less. If you just want it to take on vacation while relaxing next to the pool or to keep kids entertained then a less expensive tablet might fit your needs so you can still enjoy yourself and not have to worry as much about it getting stolen, lost, or broken. As for the ipad, you might be to concerned with it to enjoy yourself or it is just too big and a 7 inch tablet is more convienient. But if you want your cake and eat it too. Take a look at the Asus Transformer and Asus Slider. The transformer has a detatchable keyboard with a mouse pad and battery that extends your battery life, two sd slots, USB ports, and you can adjust the angle of the screen and close it like a netbook. The slider has a keyboard build into the tablet and screen flips up. No mousepad though. But there is a USB port that you can hook up a mouse to if you want. Also with the Asus tablets you can multitask and listen to something in the background while doing something else. With the ipad you can't. The Asus tablets support flash and you are able to watch clips on web pages, whereas the ipad you don't get to watch the clips because most clips are flash. The Asus tablets will fit movies on to the screen better and not have the black bars on the top like on the ipad. People are even getting rid of their ipads to get the Asus. There are also a few tablets out there that run Microsoft Windows. So that was just an example of other opions you have out there. Another thing to think about is that there are a lot of phones running on Android as for tablets also. So there is going to be a lot more compatibility between devices because most of them will run on Android. With Apple your limited with their products and don't have other outside options. The tide will turn with more offerings for Android because it will become main stream because most devices and manufacturers now are adapting the Android platform,while the \"I\" line of products are only exclusive to Apple. Will be like the Beta max vs VHS. Beta had better quality but most manufacturers adapted the VHS format instead of Beta. Well Beta died because everyone was making VHS products.\n\nDon't slam me if your an ipad lover. It's just things to think about. Don't know why people get so defensive about negative reviews about this thing. They must be the ones replacing their old Apple stuff with the newer models that have the newest inovation (cough, cough). What's new for next year? A flash for the camera? Or wait, maybe a phone feature. That way you can get rid of your cell phone and only carry the ipad around and not have to carry both. There are a lot of fan boys out there defending the ipad with not much to back it up and they take it personal. I think they are in denial and trying to justify their purchase. Well people you are the ones Apple preys on and you fall for it.\n\nUpdate: I finally broke down and got an Acer 7 inch A100 tablet for my daughter for Christmas. And after using it for a while, I will still stand by what said about the limitations and uses of a tablet. And the Acer A100 is only 7 inches perfect size for holding for long periods of time or for traveling instead of a bulky 10 inch. it can keep up with the ipad2 and has ports for micro sd, micro usb, micro HDMI, and hey even a flash for one of the two cameras. Hear that? A simple flash for the camera. Oooh...Oh wait, the ipad3 might get that, can't wait, it will make it the best ipad ever. Whatever..."}

Small enough to toss in a bag or carry around the house so you find yourself using rather than trying to \"remember\" to do \"that thing\" the next time you're at your computer. Still has some weight to it (1.3lb) so prolonged reading in certain positions will cause fatigue.\nAPP ENVIRONMENT: Really excellent variety and quality of applications for a broad range of uses and a broad range of prices. Also plays nice with content providers like amazon kindle, Google docs, and lots of news outlets.\nSLEEP MODE: It is seemingly \"always ready\" as it wakes from sleep very quickly.\nHDMI OUT: Granted there is a $40 accessory required it is nice to have the option of showing what's on your iPad 2 to a larger audience.\niOS: Overall the operating system is \"cleanly\" designed, features are easy to navigate and find.\nPROCESSING SPEED: Remarkably quick to load apps, web pages, pdfs, etc.\n\nSATISFIERS (Current features that met my expectation)\nHOMESHARING: Being able to share my iTunes library (music, movies, podcast, etc)  across my wifi network is wonderful and saves space on the iPad 2.\nSCREEN: Bright, good touch sensitivity, \"flips\" between orientations well, handles pictures and text with aplomb.\nPRICE: Reasonable considering the competition but nearly high enough to justify a \"real\" laptop\nAUDIO: Speaker is quite good for a handheld device, placement in portrait mode ends up in your lap but you can invert the iPad so not a huge deal. Also speaker faces rear of device instead of forward meaning you need to crank it louder than maybe otherwise necessary if it were forward facing.\nBATTERY LIFE: Battery holds up well even after a day of heavy usage, charges up easily over night. Can go 2-3 days without charging with moderate to light usage)\nWIFI: This simply \"works\". turn it on, detect a signal, and go. No messing around with complicated network settings.\nONSCREEN KEYBOARD: Its responsive and surprisingly easy to use. However, scrolling to a separate numbers keyboard and lack of a \"tab\" button really disrupts workflow.\n\nDISSATISFIERS (Current features that did not meet my expectations)\nFILE MANAGEMENT: File management on the iPad is Byzantine. You use iTunes to \"attach\" files to apps or email them?\nPRINTING: Unless you have an AirPrint capable printer (new hardware to buy) or one of a handful other printers you will need to use the atrocious \"file management\" system above to get the docs on you computer to print. Double whammy of pain!\nCAMERAS: The two cameras are adequate for video chatting but taking stills is a joke. True I wouldn't want to shoot a lot of birthdays holding an iPad but I would like to use a program like \"GeniusScan\" to photograph documents for later reference. The 0.7Megapixel camera is capable of \"barely legible\" documents.\nCOST PER GB: Paying >$3 per GB ($100 more for 64GB than 32GB) is nearly twice what you'd pay per GB for the difference in a stand-alone USB thumbdrive.\nTOUCH NAVIGATION: Ok so this is a general criticism of any touch device and there is no way to get around it really. Having \"grown up\" using keyboards and mice to interface with computers I am having to learn how to do tasks differently. Press-Hold, Swipe, Two vs Three fingers. All for tasks I was so used to doing with a Tab or Right-click.\n\nWISHLIST (features I'd like to see in the next-gen iPad)\nTouchscreen: The capacitive screen works fine for many things but writing notes with a \"fat\" stylus isn't one of them. Having a touch screen that doesn't require the \"fat\" stylus would greatly improve handwriting and note taking.\nUSB or SD Card ports (never gonna happen as Apple uses memory as a price differentiator but it doesn't hurt to dream)\nRetina display\nInfrared receiver/transmitter (Can anyone say universal remote!)\nGPS\nCheaper 3G antenna: $130 bucks extra for a 3G receiver plus I gotta buy a plan? ugh.\nSmartcover: Would like to see this included in the price of the device"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "As a geek for friends and family I have already taken delivery of my IPad 2 32GB WI-FI + 3G with AT&T even though they're still in short supply because of all the sadness that's hit Japan, even though 4 week delivery times are being promised, don't expect it this fast.  Since the IPad uses dedicated memory, don't be surprised if the delivery date is extended out a bit since all the parts to put this wonderful device are just not out there.\n\nA device that's finally proven once and for all that we can compute different ways, this wonderfully powerful and as always easy to use device is proving why the tablet computer is our next exploding tech market.  Our head guy here at Amazon said in his interview here that we'll see over 40 tablet style computers on the market by this coming Christmas and now I understand why.  The simple fact is much of our time on line is spent simply reading stuff.  Then why carry around a keyboard we're not using?  Be it via Wi-FI or 3G, the upload speeds are simply astounding so we can read or watch videos at speeds that will astound even jaded users such as myself.  Don't look at an IPad 2 as a new computer.  Look at it as a different way of computing.\n\nAnother surprise with the IPad 2 is in their ability to handle business applications and environments.  The first generation was geared toward those who liked looking chic at overpriced coffee shops.  This model is a real tool - a real computer - a really different way of doing things in the most user friendly and portable way possible.  Do accept the fact that you'll be spending additional dough on accessories such as keyboard, screen protectors, a stylus and more, but thanks to Amazon I've found deals that's made this as painless as possible - actually quite affordable!\n\nDo we need one, of course not.  Will our lives be a whole lot more fun and even more productive with one, beyond a doubt.  Don't hurt yourself buying one, but if you're like me and would rather live without pizza and beer twice a month so I can afford my latest toy, then this is something any user will have a blast with in everyday life no matter what you're doing.  Now why haven't you got yours ordered yet?"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I bought the first generation ipad and was pretty pleased with it.  I must admit that I had alot more fun with the ipad 1 due to the fact that it was unlocked, so I virtually got everything free.  The only problem, if you will, is that it lacked a webcam, and the ipad 2 solved that very problem!  Although the webcam isn't the best out there, it gets the job done, but if you're looking for a professional resolution, prepared to be dissapointed!  Ipad 2 basically does exactly the same thing as the first generation in terms of features. The only difference is the fact that it's thinner and lighter (HALLELUJAH!).  I enjoyed it when it arrived, but just gotta wait for a jailbreak to enjoy its full potential, but so far has the same limitations such as no flash, glares on the screen in sunlight, not bullet proof (sarcasm intended) etc.  In general the ipad is not for school, work, or anything serious of that nature (I TRIED typing a 2000-word essay, surely was not fun).  Things like the ipad is just for the trend and casual uses like surfing the net, it looks cool, fun to play with, but is not gonna beat a laptop in terms of effiency and definitely not internet speed.  Overall an OKAY experience, if I had a jail break I'd definitely upgrade this rating :PP"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The iPad is an invaluable travel companion if you are a frequent travelet.\n\nWhy do I preffer black vs white? If what you mostly do is watch videos on your iPad you want it with the black bezel because the video will blend with the black bezel and look larger than with the white it becomes kind of a distraction, this is the reason why most TV's in the market have a dark or a black bezel.\n\nPortability of this thing is amazing, Its light and its easy to lug around when you are traveling. Also the battery life is exceptional, I'm bad at keeping my devices charged up and I have done a couple of 8 hour trips and my ipad was stil kicking when I landed and a few days after, Im truely surprized.\n\nFor those of you debating between the 3GAT&T, 3GVerison or the Wifi version, it depends on where you go to. I had the original 32 wifi only and I was very happy with it I noticed I got Wi-Fi access at a lot of places and I could also use the wifi hot spot on my phone to connect however, in recent travels I have been sent to middle of nowhere america where AT&T has no 3G coverage and hotels have no wifi (yes they are out there, hotels that still have no wifi) after I returned from my last trip to said location I decided I should get the Verizon iPad simply from the coverage perspective and since the 3G service is not on contract and the Verizon plans have more options I decided that was my choice. Now is this the best option for everyone, no! I think the 3G is just for a small amount of users the vast majority should be fine with a 16GB or a 32GB, if you know your way around the app market place and apps like Air Video Server and tools like DVD Fab and TVersity you don't need that much storage space on your iPad you can simply stream everything. Besides, I have a 32GB and I have 57 videos loaded in that 32GB iPad which if I watch 10-12 on a trip it is an overstatement, I'll watch a few on the plane but the rest, Im streaming from my Media Center at home or from NetFlix. When talking to people in line I was shocked at the number of people looking for the Verizon version when they do not travel, people if you are home most of the time just use your wifi, its cheaper and its faster! Another thing to note is that if you are an international traveller and want 3G the Verizon iPad is NOT Global wireless (so no 3G anywhere outside of the US) however wifi will work just fine.\n\nYou will see people complain about resolution and such and honestly, I think the resolution is perfect, the iPad is not meant to replace your laptop or your desktop or your TV, if it was why they would have bothered with airplay? If you are expecting to dump your laptop because you got an iPad think again, if you just use your laptop for browsing pages and playing games then you might get away with it however if you expect to do Office on these, think again, until MS gets their act together and decides that IOS is another venue of revenue for them I will still need to carry my laptop around to do word/excel/ppt files. Lack of flash support has not bothered me, yes I wish I could see some pages however, Im not in to the too flashy stuff (no pun intended) I rather get the straight text and keep going my only gripe would be that when Im conected via WiFi I would like to get full pages and not the mobile version however that is not an iPad problem it is a server problem.\n\nOverall my score goes as follows\nComfort and portability A+\nBattery Life A+\nApp Diversity and usability A+\nInterface A+\nExpandibility C (I don't need a USB port or anything like that however it is annoying that if I ever needed and expansion either I have to pay for an adapter or its not available)\nTV Out Support B+ (simply judging that for HDMI you have to buy the dongle)\nCammera Quality C (who needs a cammera in their iPad anyways? Face time sure, rear facing meh)\n\nOther thoughts:\n\nGet a screen protector, I tried the Invisible Shield for my Gen 1 and hated it, the material removes the slickness of the screen and makes it harder to interact. I like the Splash screen protector, it is like its not there and it does make cleaning a bit easier.\nGet a case this thing is beautiful but if you would like to maintain its resale value get a case that cover both front or back or separate covers, I think the Vapor case hack is pretty interesting.\nInvestigate tools like DVD Fab Video Converter (excellent for making iPad versions of your DVD's and BD's and it does take care of EVERYTHING for you from conversion to the right format to importing to iTunes) TVersity and Air Video for content streaming.\nBe realistic on your expectations, I know Apple calls their products magic and their user interface and experience is fenomenal however there are limitations as to what these things can do so try to make an informed purchase that you are happy with instead of rushing and then having something that doesnt meet your expectations. For me I was debating between this and a mac book air however for me since I have to lug around my work computer anyways this won."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Apple fans are loyal (almost to the point of being fanatic) and are a loveable enough lot but one that can get quite upset if one pans an Apple product.\n\nBelieve it or not, I've come to praise the iPad 2 but with some modest reservations.\n\nI was an early adopter (standing on line the day it went on sale and patiently waiting for it for almost 5 hours).  Naturally, I was impressed at how quick and easy it was to use.  A lot of thought has gone into the product and it shows.  Instant on (I have the magnetic cover) is a bonus and the screen - large and crystal clear - is not so much a selling point but rather a \"how to\" example for other tablet manufacturers to follow.\n\nThe Apple store in the meatpacking district of New York City has a qualified, and very friendly, staff who set the unit up for me while they answered my various questions. Considering that they had been doing this since 5 PM and it was now after 10, that is a lot of dedication for one staff!  The most amazing thing is: they were all quite proud of the iPad 2. It says a lot when the company employees are that loyal.\n\nAnd the iPad 2 deserves such praise.  The product is, in short, wonderful.  Light weight yet with a solid feel to it, I plan on taking mine to Europe shortly.  After you turn it on, the balance of the iPad 2 is self-explanatory.  From the opening screen of icons, the touch screen makes it almost too-easy to take the product that seriously. But it is a useful tool what with a Calendar, notebook, iPod, photo studio, etc. Naturally the much hearalded APP STORE is there and works fine and at a lightning speed.  Although I wonder about the \"10 hour battery life\" claim - it does manage to work long enough to please the most diligent of users.\n\nWhere the iPad falls short is in the area of productivity.  Much discussed, and a sore point, is the lack of a USB port. In todays day and age, that is almost an unforgivable sin. I did get the hook up so I could download my pictures (it works too - and, again, it does it so fast and so effortlessly that it is a minor miracle). There is something almost childish in the decision not to include at least one USB port especially after the loud fracas that happened after the release of the first iPad.  FLASH is another sore point and, frankly, one that I don't understand. There is some conflict going on with the world of APPLE and flash so we don't have it. This makes it very difficult to surf the web. Safari is quick but without flash, it misses one of its major components. Again, and this is just my feeling, this is something that could have been corrected quite easily - starting a year ago with the original.  Now, the iPad 2 (and the original version, I'm sure) can still do quite an amazing amount of work without these two features but as they are considered standard, it is a puzzle as to why the iPad 2 did not have both of them installed.  Also, the lack of a port decreases the iPad's place in the workforce. How can you install, let's say, OFFICE MAC?  The system can print (via Bluetooth) so it could be used as an Office-on-the-run (held landscape, the keyboard is quite easy to do some very fast typing upon - one could produce an awful lot of work on it but . . . without a CD drive to install programs, it makes it difficult).\n\nOther than that, the unit is nothing short of brilliant. Reading books on it is a pleasure (in most cases the iPad 2 is lighter than a paperback so that is saying a lot) and the wide assortment of apps makes it a standard tool that nearly everybody should own."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The Apple iPad.  Those of us who own one have recently been called less than flattering names for daring to use it and enjoying the experience!  But the devices' popularity is growing; indeed I am seeing them everywhere.  Just yesterday I sat next to a woman at my local Ford dealership who was reading a book on her iPad even as I held a text message conversion with a good friend while reading the news from CNN and NPR.\n\nFor me the device fulfills several different functions I have been meaning to purchase in separate devices, like an e-book reader, portable music player for my master bedroom, and electronic photo frame.  Why buy all three of those devices when the Apple iPad does all three functions in one neat silver (albeit expensive) package?  And since buy my iPad in the Fall of last year, the uses for the device have grown tenfold, until now, it is almost indispensable.\n\nNow Apple has released the iPad 2 and those of us who use the original are throwing them over for the next big, or should I say smaller thing.  Since this new one was for the business I work for I decided to do a one for one replacement of the one I already used for testing purposes; in other words I ordered an \"iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G\" version.\n\nThe \"iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi /3G\" Facts\n\nOn the surface the iPad 2 is not demonstratively different from the iPad Original.  Featuring a Dual-core (Apple designed) 1 GHz A5 processor, the 1.33 pound (1.34 pounds for the 3G) iPad 2 is notably thinner than the iPad Original, though the screen size stays the same.  The other big changes: two camera, one rear facing, the other front facing now ship standard with all models; and the graphics are reportedly 9 times as fast.\n\nNo matter what hardware version (Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi/3G, 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB) you chose the Ultra-Portable, iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/ 3G is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the far left.  Along the right edge of the 0.5\" thick iPad you'll find the screen lock/mute and volume control switches, while the bottom of the 9.56\" long device is reserved for speakers and the USB/power port.  The USB port is proprietary so, no, like the iPad Original you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord you can plug it into your computer and into an outlet to recharge the device.\n\nThe \"iPad 2\" (also available in black and white body styles) can be had with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of memory, and all iterations are fitted with a 1GHz Apple A5 custom-designed, high performance, low-power processor.  Internet connectivity is through either Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), and or 3G: UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz) and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).  Bluetooth 2.1 EDR is also provided with either configuration.  A 4G model of the iPad2 has not been announced.\n\nThe 9.7-inch fingerprint resistant LED-backlit glossy widescreen multi-touch color display offers 1024x768 resolution and can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.  The IPad 2 is fitted with an ambient light sensor and the device supports 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable and 1024x 768 with Dock Connector to VGA adapter.\n\nThe back camera can be used for HD (720p) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera with 5x zoom.  The front camera can also be used for (VGA) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera pictures.\n\nNew Apps that ship with the iPad 2 include FaceTime a real-time video chat application that allows you to calls someone else's iPad 2, iPhone 4, new iPod touch, or Mac over Wi-Fi and establish a video chat session.  The App will not work via 3G.  The other new App is Photo Booth an application that allows you to take pictures of yourself with various effects.\n\nAudio playback response frequency is 20Hz - 20,000Hz and the iPad 2 supports the following audio formats:\n\no  HE-AAC (V1)\no  AAC (16 to 320 Kbps)\no  Protected AAC (from iTunes Store)\no  MP3 (16 to 320 Kbps)\no  MP3 VBR\no  Audible (formats 2, 3, and 4)\no  Apple Lossless\no  AIFF\no  WAV\n\nThe iPad can view the following document types:\n\no  Images (.jpg, .tiff, .gif);\no  Documents (.doc and .docx (Microsoft Word), .txt, .pdf, .rtf);\no  Web pages (.htm and .html);\no  Keynote (.key);\no  Numbers (.numbers);\no  Pages (.pages);\no  PowerPoint (.ppt and .pptx)\no  Outlook Contacts (.vcf);\no  Excel (.xls and .xlsx)\n\nRe-syncing with iTunes\n\nThe iPad 2 will sync up whatever Apps, music, Podcasts, movies, etc., connected/ associated with your iTunes account and currently on your iTunes desktop.  I was able to sync the iPad 2 to iTunes and like magic everything that was on my iPad 1 showed up on my iPad 2, sans the folders I had set up to group Apps in.\n\nTransferring My AT&T 3G Account\n\nAll of the iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G devices I have purchased thus far use AT&T for their 3G service.  There are two plans at the time of this review: $14.99 for 250MB a month data package and $25.00 for 2GB date package.\n\nA funny thing happened along the way to transferring my current 3G plan to my new iPad 2: AT&T killed (deactivated) the removable SIM card in the iPad 1.  They claim they needed to, but I'm not so sure, because it makes no sense to me.  Another (micro) SIM card can be obtained from the nearest AT&T store for free, though so stores may charge you $15.00, so check around.  Once the new SIM is inserted into the iPad 1 you can set-up and activate the 3G service on the device.\n\nNote: unused data package byte (for lack of a better term), cannot be rolled over from month-to-month.  Conversely, if your plan minutes run out during the month AT&T will not automatically anoint you with more; more minutes can be purchased from the iPad 2, but it is a manual process.  However, the package will be renewed at the end of the 30 days, and continue to renew every 30 days unless stopped.\n\nMicrosoft ActiveSync\n\nSurprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, setting up the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G to use Microsoft Exchange via Exchange ActiveSync is simple and easy; all told it took less the two minute to start receiving my business e-mail on the device, and there does not seem to be a limit to the number of devices associated with a given ActiveSync account.\n\nAfter I established the connection via ActiveSync I verified inbox functionality by reading, responding to, forwarding, and moving, e-mail.  The iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G even allows you to choose whether or not you want to download your business contacts and calendar; sweet!\n\nAnd once connected I am able to control password usage, minimum and maximum length, age, complexity, and expiration via an Exchange ActiveSync policy.  The policy can also control other aspect of the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G's including third-party e-mail account creation; Windows SharePoint Services and Windows File Shares access; message size limits; attachment downloading, as well as a host of other security related features and functions.\n\nWord to the wise: Exchange ActiveSync policies, limited as they can be configured to disable a number of features on the device including camera, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.  And yes, utilizing ActiveSync I can even wipe the iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G from the Exchange server, and as long as the tablet remains a part of the ActiveSync policy it will continue to wipe every time its powered on unless it is either removed from the policy or the check mark is removed from the radio button instructing ActiveSync to \"Perform a remote wipe to clear mobile device data.\"\n\nVPN Access\n\nThe iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G has VPN access and it actually work quite well.  There are three options: L2TP, PPTP, or Cisco IPSEC. Like Exchange ActiveSync the VPN functionality was surprisingly easy to set up and get going, all one needs to know is what information to plug in and away we go!\n\nVPN took less than a minute to set up and configure, and once complete I was able to log into my company Intranet and thanks to some (free) Apps I was able to RDP into my workstation from the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G; again, sweet!  Yes, the lack of makes maneuvering around the desktop somewhat challenging, but I could still get around the desktop and use it.  Note: there are paid versions of the Apps I used that offer crude mouse functionality.\n\nLike all of the network components on iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G VPN can be togged on and off at will.\n\nFirst Impressions:\n\nLike my personal iPad 1, I really, really, really, like the Apple iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G I have been testing.  Naysayers aside this thing is cool and I am happy to own one and even take it out in public!  I love being able to take my favorite book(s) with me when I am on the go, and I have the ability to stop at a Wi-Fi hotspot and plugging into the Internet in order to read the latest news, get the weather, run an application, etc.\n\nBut, I really like the fact that I can take the lightweight iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G with me everywhere and still gain access to my pre-selected books, magazines, music and images, not to mention a seemingly endless supply of useful applications.  And let's not forget the Internet and business e-mail.\n\nToday while was waiting in line (yes I said line) for my dealership to open up so I could get me car serviced, I brook out my iPad 2 and started watch videos on Vevo; now how cool is that?\n\nSetting up Wi-Fi is easy enough; the antenna is always on and looking for new connection.  I set up the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G to use the secure wireless setup at work; I typed in the pass-phrase via the incredibly handy keyboard and surfed the Internet; simple and easy.  Since I bought the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G I have taken it out frequently to places that offer free Wi-Fi access and in only one instance did I have an issue connecting.  Nice!  And even then I effortlessly switched to 3G and, instance access.\n\nConclusions\n\nLike the iPad 1 before it the iPad 2 is the must have device of the decade, period!  Not a day goes by when I do not use it for something.  I love the portability of the device, the ease of use, the utilitarian nature of the unit, thanks in large part to the plethora of Apps that can be down loaded and utilized for the tablet.\n\nIs the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G ready for the enterprise?  I say yes with a few caveats; chief among them is the inability of the tablet to truly manipulate Microsoft Office Applications without the assistance of the Documents-to-Go application ($9.99).  Second is the inability to truly mirror the iPad screen on a monitor, however with the Apple Digital AV Adapter that can be changed.  Video can be presented onto the screen--via an HDMI connection.  Lastly, is the lack of available USB port(s) or a memory card reader that will accept memory devices and help you keep files organized on-the-go, as well as the ability to truly turn the iPad into a mobile office.  As it stands now any document you want to work with must be e-mailed and then opened.  However, the iPad was never marketed as a laptop, or laptop replacement, so...\n\nNot that these problems cannot be overcome, but they are limitation that a laptop and even netbooks do not suffer from.  However, hands down, the Apple iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G is a performance winner, and one heck of an e-book reader! Yes, the entrance fee (799.00) is steep, and enterprise customers will have to think long and hard at the cost, however the iPad now has a certain \"cool\" factor that is hard to escape.  The more large enterprises adapt the iPad and find practical uses for it, the more popular it will become in the hall of corporate America.\n\nSo far the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G has more than lived up to my expectations and I have fun testing the limits of its ability to operate effectively in the enterprise and personal environments."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "We had high expectations when we first got our iPad. Right now, it is the last gadget in demand of the family, firmly behind a toshiba notebook, a kindle, and android phone. We mainly use it to surf the web. But without flash, it becomes quite annoying. I often have to switch to a pc to continue surfing for video and games etc. So we end up using it to play plants vs zombies or other game apps or surfing the web when the computer is taken. Even watching streaming movie on it is stressful, which requires holding the iPad compared with placing a notebook on a surface. Then we realized that iPad is a fashion. It is not as good reading device as kindle because of the weight and LCD display. It is not as good as pc for many tasks requiring keyboard, storage and multitasking. It is slow. It could be a good surfing device if it supports flash. To prove my point, it takes me a great deal of effort to type this review. Try place the cursor by tapping on the touch screen."}

I Skyped my parents in Florida for the first time last night (there is no HD version of Skype, so you have to 2X it to fill the screen) and it worked very well.  Last year, I played around with a friends original iPad and decided to be patient and wait for the iPad 2.  So glad I did, the iPad 2 is FAST.  Apps open instantaneously and it is a sleek machine.  I have a hard time putting it down.  I realize that the iPad 3 will probably have some major upgrades but if you have waited for the iPad 2 just get one and enjoy it.  It is the best tablet out there!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "If you're considering a tablet, the only rational choice is the iPad 1 or the iPad 2. Anything else you there is too expensive/too buggy/lacking support/etc. As someone who owns a desktop but no laptop, the iPad 2 is just perfect. A laptop would often be redundant, though it would be handy for working outside of the home.  With the iPad, I will use it all the time both in the home and elsewhere.\n\nI will try to add some comments that haven't been covered:\n\n* I find that 16gb is fine, though this may change if app sizes get much larger. I don't intend to store my music or a bunch of videos on this. Videos can be streamed, or added as-needed, and I rely on DropBox to store files - it lets me view and edit files between my desktop and my iPad.\n\n* Part of the reason the iPad is perfect for travel is that you can use it in any position, unlike a laptop, where you have to find a seat.\n\n* It won't ever got hot or overheat. Personally, I've had a couple laptops expire on me due to overheating. You always have to keep them on a firm surface so you don't block the vents. The iPad doesn't have these problems (I think that the Macbook Airs similarly will never overheat). You no longer have to grab a tray or giant book to set your laptop on when using it in bed.\n\n* Terrific value. All hype aside, the design, durability and capability of an iPad 2 is such that I would expect to pay much more. You can find a cheap laptop for the same price, and it will be capable of much more. However, the iPad will accomplish 95% of what you want to do on a computer, and will open doors (via apps) to new and totally unexpected experiences.\n\n* Browsing the web is better on the iPad. At least, it often is. It's certainly better to take your iPad on the couch than to hunch over a laptop on the coffee table. Though the screen is small compared to a desktop screen, it's equivalent to working on a bigger screen because of how close you will be. Scrolling and navigating a webpage with your hand is a qualitatively better experience than using the tools we've become accustomed to (mouse, trackball or trackpad). I guess that's why sci-fi movies always depict computers with touch interfaces in the future. Moving the page around and adjusting the size of everything by hand never gets old.\n\n* Just like with my iPhone 4, I rarely sync my iPad 2. I'm not a huge fan of iTunes. I can sync occasionally to back-up my apps. I don't use iTunes to manage files (again, I rely on Dropbox). Dropbox and Evernote are must-have apps on all my computers and portable devices.\n\n* Safari can use some work. I prefer the tabbed browsing, not having to switch windows. There are some alternative browsers (I bought 360 Browser, which is good), but Apple won't let me select those as my default browser. I don't use Safari on my desktop, but even if I wanted to sync my passwords and history, I don't think it'll let me (it will sync bookmarks through iTunes though). I really wish Apple would loosen up so that Firefox or Chrome would be available, and that one of those could be my default.\n\n* As cool as the smart cover is, I spent my money on a wireless keyboard instead. I really don't think the smart cover is going to make a difference as long as I take other measures to protect my screen. I may skip the HDMI adapter as well - it would be fun, but there is never a time that I will need to project my iPad on my HDTV.\n\nIn summary, if you think you'd like it, you'll probably love it. If you are just kinda curious but content with your current set-up, you can save yourself the money. For the same price, you can get an adequate laptop running Windows 7. I think this is a great alternative though."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "So I'm in the kitchen, listening to my music library, and typing a review for the I-Pad 2. I have put a little more than 14 hours of research and 6 hours of non-stop use. I'm not gonna waste my time writing the specs for this device because if you are reading this I assume you already know the specifications, if not you can easily access the Apple website and do your own research. This review is aimed more towards the educated consumer. A consumer, who like me, has spent various hours of the night researching and contemplating his or her next moves.\n\nFirst, I want to start off with the word \"tablet\", what is a tablet and who needs it? As an avid P.C. user, I tend to define the device as too short, too little. A underpowered, pre-mature device not ready for this day and age. The truth is, their are more people out there who need a tablet versus a laptop. Having a quad core, overclocked, power hungry P.C. I am like most other users; who tend to have a bias when selecting/comparing  portable products. I have been for some time; looking for a laptop with great battery life, portability and power? I first went out and purchased a Macbook pro for about $1199+ some. After a couple weeks of use I was in love. I could not stop showing it off and playing with it. Then I attempted to play games and yes they were playable! But I found myself running to my P.C. whenever I was gonna get serious and then I found myself using my desktop when editing videos. Yet again, I found myself running to my P.C. when it came to doing anything that involved time and effort... It was at this point that I realized that I never used my laptop for more than a hour. Utilizing a mere 20-40% of its power. I used it for; writing papers, showing off pictures and Internet browsing. So I decided to return it. In search for something that made sense.\n\nI never considered a net-book useful or even worthy of my time, even less a tablet. The Motorola Xoom came out and I thought it had potential compared to last years 256MB I-Pad. It offers 1GB of internal memory and 32GB of storage space, all for $599. It not only had the potential, but also the power I craved. Although, its pre-mature operating system was a deterrence. This is the same thing that turned me away from the original IPad. Dispite the fact that I liked the original, if people didn't demand it, the product would die and I would be left with a 500 dollar piece of silicon or waste. I needed something portable and practical. I just felt the tablet was a little more practical, if not more useful too because of its  portability and extended battery life. So I took the plunge and got the Ipad 2.\n\nFirst impressions didn't fall short; it was easy to set up, had a beautiful screen, and gorgeous aesthetics. While Apple boasts about its 60,000 app's, I'll tell you what, it's not enough (way better than android though). While you can download IPhone and ITouch apps; they are simply not the same (a 3.5inch app on a 9inch screen). Face Time also seems to be problem, since it cost money for all your friends who don't have an IPad 2 or new Macbook. Tango or Skype are excellent alternatives, but still only supported in a 3.5 inch window. Despite this, it has some killer apps (e.g gmail, calendar syncing, web browsing and etc). My favorite app is TeamViewer, which gives you remote access to your PC from anywhere. This app is simply amazing. I was able to install some programs to my PC from school! While It doesn't support flash, it plays almost every video stream I've seen from the web. Hey, that's all I needed anyways. So I can't complain, but all you flash gamers might.\n\nNow I found this whole \"touch-typing\" thing to be an exasperation. Since I am primarily using this product for note taking, its important I am as accurate as possible. Keys kept skipping and words kept missing. So I upgraded to the Apple-wireless-keyboard.. sigh. It was a well spent 69.00 dollars (cheaper models are available). I am able to control volume, brightness and music. Also makes my tablet feel more like a high end net-book. I want to talk a little bit more about writing. I bought this tablet with the intention of using google docs. Well it works, but you have use the mobile version, which has limited functionality. I tried switching to desktop editing, but it was horrendously slow and unworkable. As a matter of fact I'm writing this with google docs now. As long as you are not using bullet points or etc; you should be fine. I do notice some errors that result from a slow ping, so it's worth trying noting it happens. I could more easily recommend using apple's built in \"note-taker\". Its responsive, practical and free.\n\nAs far as \"Air-Play\" goes, simply amazing. Kind of a pain to set up though. One really has to go into every setting in I-Tunes and mark share libraries under preferences and account profile. When the set up is complete, you simply log in with your I-pad and use the same mobile user name and you are good to go. Of course you have to keep your computer running the whole time unless you have a dedicated server of some sort. Air-paly grants you access to your music, videos and HD collection. which makes that whole HDMI out thing really convenient. Granted its only 720p, Ive never noticed a huge difference between 720 and 1080p Additionally stream times are relatively quick. Just keep in mind this depends a whole lot on your network. Which bring me to my next issue of storage. I honestly feel the only thing anyone needs on tablet is, pictures and apps. Unless you are going on a long trip; a couple movies. I am content and don't think I would ever need an I-Pad with more storage. As far as 3G goes, will its just that. A three year old bandwidth solution. If you can get a tethering plan instead, I would highly recommend it, as you can also transplant GPS automatically when tethering.\n\nAll in all I'm really content I took the I-Pad 2 plunge. A dive, I really never saw myself taking or considering. Having an android phone and P.C.; it would seem like honeycomb would have made more sense; considering the attractive specs and all. None the less, the IPad 2 meets my draconian standards for 2011. Making any other device look over weight and under-spec'd. While the consensus of professional reviewers have voted the camera insufficient, I could honestly say it does what I need it to do, which is provide fun and entertainment. The rear HD camera is similar to the one installed on the new macbook pro models (2011 refresh). Other than that, I don't plan on taking high quality photos with the device. I might do future reviews with the camera though. check out my youtube channel for video reviews, just look up oceansidecreations."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The first iPad really defined the tablet market and while a trickle of competing tablets were released, none of them has matched the critical acclaim of the iPad 2. The consensus of CNET, Engadget and most other tech reviewers is that the Motorola Xoom is the closest competitor, but falls just short of iPad.\n\nThis latest version of iPad sports a thinner design, front and back camera for casual filming and FaceTime/Skype video calls, a gyroscope, better speaker and, of course, a dual-core processor and 9x faster graphics capabilities. You still get the 10 hour battery life, but it's all wrapped up in a nicer package. That said, it doesn't seem drastically different than the original iPad and it feels like this version is simply an iPad with cameras, and the cameras don't perform especially well.\n\nGranted, the increased graphics capabilities do make a noticeable difference in the handful of games that take advantage of the increased speed (\"Infinity Blade\", \"Real Racing 2 HD\"), but most of the apps I use most frequently - e.g. CNN for iPad, Netflix, ABC Player, iTunes Video, iBooks, Pandora, SiriusXM, Apple Remote - don't feel like the user experience changed much beyond the increased volume coming from the speaker.\n\nMy big disappointments with the iPad 2 are that the cameras aren't great, though that's forgivable since I'd use them mostly for video calling anyway, and that the screen didn't increase in resolution from the first generation iPad! I want my Retina display!\n\nHowever, overlooking the faults of the iPad 2, it's still the best tablet on the market, in my opinion.\n\nMy kids love the educational apps (\"Monkey Preschool Lunchbox\", \"First Words Animals\", \"Shape Puzzle HD\", \"Talking Larry\", \"Peekaboo Barn\" and \"Garage Band\" are all highly recommended), and I think they've gone a long way in teaching even my mildly autistic daughter memorization and puzzle solving skills!\n\nI also love that I can get paid content from apps lie Netflix, (Comcast) Xfinity TV and Hulu+ and even free content like on-demand \"Bachelor\" episodes and other shows from the free \"ABC Player\" app. There's just so much capability available to the device through apps and certainly, the wealth of apps available in the App Store is one of the iPad's biggest strengths vs. competitors!\n\nIt's also a great device for checking email and casually surfing the web, as long as the site you view doesn't require Flash, which is still unsupported. I used to have a netbook that took 5 minutes to boot, then had an awkwardly small browser window and slow response, but you see nothing but instant-on capability and smooth navigation with iPad. I'd definitely prefer this tablet to a netbook!\n\nAlso, a couple of other miscellaneous tips for those interested:\n\n1. The new magnetic&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Smart-Cover/dp/B004QKM3AA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Smart Cover</a>&nbsp;from Apple is a must-try! The automatic wake and sleep on opening/closing the cover is more handy than you might first think, as is the ability to roll the cover into a stand for the iPad! We watched Netflix from bed while my wife nursed our baby recently, and it would have been a pain without the handy stand!\n2. If you buy an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/AirPort-Express/dp/B0002GDIII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">AirPort Express</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Apple-TV/dp/B001FA1NK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Apple TV</a>, you can wirelessly stream music (and video in the case of the Apple TV) to a remote set of speakers using AirPlay or the Apple Remote app! It's cool to be able to listen to my iTunes content from my kitchen with the iPad as remote control!\n3. If you're debating whether to buy the WiFi-only or the WiFi/3G iPad, it's worth noting that by paying for the WiFi hotspot capabilities on an iPhone 4, you can not only get data, but location services for your iPad 2, so you can save a couple hundred dollars on hardware and future-proof your connection speed since you can buy a new phone instead of a new iPad to take advantage of increased network speed.\n\nIn summary, I highly recommend the iPad 2 if you're in the market for a tablet. Its apps are highly entertaining, portable and easy/quick to launch a play, and it just may change the way you surf the web and check email! Even your kids will love it!\n\nThe few innovations this model sports aren't what they could have been, but are nonetheless compelling."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "So after picking it up Friday and playing around with it most of the weekend, what's the final word? Seemless. If you had the first one and moved to the 2nd one, it's worth the move. I made a back up of the original and after going through iTunes everything just moved right over. Made a few tweeks here and there but otherwise it was painless.\n\nAs far as the size goes, it's definently lighter than the first one and it's really lighter than the XOOM, which I had a chance to play around with on Saturday. Also due to the size, it feels like it swims around in the original's case so you definently will want a new one. With the new case, Apple really wants you to show off the sleekness of the device which is cool, but you want to take advantage of having AppleCare in case you accidentally drop it and it breaks. When things get smaller and slimmer, it always tends to feel more fragile. My complaint about the exposure is the back of the iPad which I can see being scuffed in a few weeks so I may get something to protect the back of it. Otherwise, this truly looks like a slate.\n\nIt does feel speedier when loading up apps and as far as gaming goes, some like Infinity Blade and Shadow Guardian really gets a boost from the extra speed. They look much better and the loss of framerate is not as noticable as the iPad 1's.\n\nThere is however still a bit of barely noticable stutter in some movies shown via Netflix when streaming which makes me hope that the next gen iPad has the Retina Display or something better for true on the go HD viewing.\n\nThe cameras, while not the best ( I still don't see someone trying to do serious photography with this so this is not a big deal for me) still does very great with Face Time support. I demoed it a few times with one of my friends who also had the ipad 2 (as well as the iPhone 4) and people who has never seen Face Time in action were astounded. This was the video phone that we only imagined back in the 60s and 70s.\n\nThere is still no SD Slot, no Thunderbolt support however the battery still holds a charge ( I just charged mine for the first time last night) and the screen is more bright and crisp than that of the XOOM.\n\nApple has done a good job at taking the next step with the iPad and any competitor that had something coming out this year really need to take notes because if they don't move swiftly enough, Apple will dominate the tablet space in a similar fashion as they did the mp3 space with the iPod.\n\nIf you had the first one ther are a few small surprises that you are in for, if this is your first one, you will be amazed about what you have missed out on."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "For anyone out there who is considering whether or not to make the leap and purchase the iPad 2, this review is for you. If you're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with a number of people commenting (both positively and negatively) over the past 11 months.\n\nLet me begin by saying this upfront, I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I don't get anything for writing this. I'm not an Apple \"fanboy\" although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products.\n\nPhysical Characteristics\nThe iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really wasn't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you're holding the device. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.\n\nNew and \"Improved\"\nApple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.\n\nThe screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.\n\nThe addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.\n\nSmart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.\n\nMultitasking Support\nOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature. The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.\n\nApps\nOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap). The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.\n\nPros:\nWeight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.\n\nBattery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.\n\nBooks. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.\n\nCons:\nStill no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.\n\nStill no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.\n\nHDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.\n\nNo Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.\n\nIf you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2. If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet. I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1. I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI. While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets. With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors."}

That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference isn't tremendous when you're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation isn't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it.\n\nNew and \"Improved\"\nApple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements. If you're just playing Angry birds and reading e-mail you're not going to know the difference.\n\nThe screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a \"new\" part in that it isn't identical to the old, it's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though.\n\nThe addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.\n\nSmart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.\n\nMultitasking Support\nOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature. The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.\n\nApps\nOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap). The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.\n\nPros:\nWeight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.\n\nBattery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.\n\nBooks. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.\n\nCons:\nStill no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.\n\nStill no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.\n\nHDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.\n\nNo Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.\n\nIf you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2. If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet. I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1. I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI. While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets. With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "First things first: I consider myself relatively unbiased on Apple products. I received the original iPad as a gift (which I was able to return once I saw the iPad 2 announcement) and I have an old iPod 4th gen with color display which is still going strong after a few years, but aside from that I typically use Windows PCs and my phone is Android.\n\nIf you don't have an iPad, and you're trying to decide whether you want one or not, ask yourself: What will I use this for?\n\nThis is meant to be an overview for the uninitiated, since according to initial news reports, 70% of people who have bought the iPad 2 so far didn't own an original iPad.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nIf you want it for web surfing, a portable Netflix or other video screen, gaming, or FaceTime/Skype video chat, it's definitely adept at all of those things. I used to read books and magazines in my bed before going to sleep, and I still occasionally do, but now I've found that surfing with the iPad is just as convenient and relaxing.\n\nThe iPad is all about the apps, many of which greatly expand the native capability of the iPad. You can get Microsoft Office clones, remote desktop, second screen, calculators, alarm clocks, remote apps for cable boxes and disc players, and more. Some are free, many are not. I'll get into some of those a bit later, but keep in mind this isn't intended to be a review of apps. If you want to see what's out there, you can search the App store on the web or in iTunes. If you expect the iPad to be able to do something not in its specs, check the app store first.\n\nThe only difference I've seen with the iPad 2 is that now there are a few games out there that are optimized for iPad 2, or have improved iPad 2 modes. Lots of games are free and those that aren't occasionally go on sale. The only two I've bought are Scrabble HD and Dungeon Hunter 2 HD, both when they were $1 each. (I've played many more free ones.) I recommend both. Dungeon Hunter 2 HD is a great 3D game that tries really hard to be Diablo 2, with character classes, customization, and online play. It looks great and has never crashed or had a framerate stutter. The iPad 1 had problems with crashing and low framerates with games occasionally, and this version seems to be a much better gaming system. That's the only big difference I noticed between the iPad 1 and iPad 2 so far though.\n\nFor me, having a huge array of apps to play with, many of which are free if you don't mind ads here and there, and the convenience of being able to web surf without having to drag out my laptop makes this worth having. Plus the battery gets 8-10 hours on a charge, which is a far cry better than any laptop I know of. It's a great e-reader for airplane travel, even really long flights, though you can't use it on take-off and landing of course.\n\nWi-Fi performance is flawless and the range is excellent. More than once I've pulled up in the driveway and before I'm even in the house, I've heard my iPad's ESPN ScoreCenter app go off to inform me of a score. I can't speak to the 3G quality, though, as I don't have that model. Frankly, I don't think most people need it. If I'm out of the middle of nowhere and need the web for something, I'd much rather pull out my phone than the iPad. If you just have to use the iPad, tons of public places have Wi-Fi these days.\n\nIf you want to be able to print things, you might think at first that you need an AirPrint compatible printer. Fear not! A simple Google search for \"AirPrint any printer\" will show you how to configure your PC or Mac to broadcast its printers with AirPrint. I have Brother and Canon printers and they both worked with it. It took some time to download and install the AirPrint service and then configure printer sharing options on my network, but that was a far cry better than buying a new printer or an expensive printing app! Still, I've found that my printers occasionally disappear from the list, and the only way to get them back is to shut the iPad down completely and power it back on. Annoying.\n\nLimitations:\n\nThe iPad 2 still doesn't support Adobe Flash. Some websites are adapting to this and adding HTML 5 video. Many aren't. Keep that in mind if you're a heavy web video user. I love to watch web shows like the Nostalgia Critic and the Angry Video Game Nerd, and most web show hosting sites are still in Flash. Also, some sites have flash menus, making them completely unusable to you if they don't have a mobile version. It's this that prevents the iPad from being a true laptop replacement, regardless of how much you spend on apps. I still end up having to fire up the laptop to use several websites I enjoy.\n\nThe screen is supposedly oleophobic but gets fingerprints all over the place in mere minutes of use. I find that extremely irritating. If you feel the same way, get a screen protector like the ZAGG InvisibleShield (though if you get that particular one, be VERY careful when you install it, it's extremely difficult to get it on there with no air bubbles). You will thank yourself when all it takes to clear fingerprints is one wipe, plus it protects from scratches to boot. To get fingerprints off the screen itself took vigorous scrubbing and left streaks, which needed isopropyl alcohol to remove. Also, in direct sunlight, the glare off the screen makes it hard to see. Add fingerprints to that and it's practically impossible.\n\nAlthough the iPad 2 has two cameras, one on the front and one on the back, I haven't found much reason to use them other than for video chat. The cameras are terrible quality and the iPad 2 just isn't portable enough to drag around everywhere for camera usage. You can get an excellent digital camera for $150 or less, and most smartphones have much better cameras than the iPad has. Use one of those instead.\n\nIf you don't own a laptop, don't expect the iPad 2 to do everything a laptop will, especially if you plan on doing any work-related things. Office applications are not included. Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, which are like Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint respectively, are available for $10 each. I don't own them, but apparently they work reasonably well. However they are not 100% compatible with Microsoft Office documents, especially if you have more complicated formatting, macros, or animations that don't translate directly. Plus, the virtual keyboard is a bit more tiring to type on and definitely hinders typing speed. I average about 45-50 WPM on it, where I can get 80-100 WPM on a normal keyboard. You can be a little lazy with it to increase your effective typing speed, though; you can leave out apostrophes or required capitalization and the iPad will nearly always fix it. That also mostly takes care of my fingers occasionally hitting the wrong keys due to the lack of tactile feedback, but I still end up having to go back and fix words sometimes. Also, sometimes it fixes things that don't need to be fixed. It always seems to correct \"its\" to \"it's\", but what if I mean \"its\"? I know the difference!\n\nA lot of other features that you would expect a laptop to have are not here, though, or cost more. For example...\n- You can give slideshow presentations or display video on external monitors, projectors, or TVs with it, but that will cost you $29 for a VGA adapter plus the price of a cable and DVI to VGA adapter (monitors or projectors), or $39 for an HDMI adapter plus the price of an HDMI cable (newer TVs), or $39 for a composite or component video cable (older TVs)\n- You can transfer photos from a camera directly without having to use iTunes, but that will cost $29 for a camera adapter kit\n- The iPad is terrible at file storage for things other than music, videos, photos and apps, and with no USB or SD card slot, can't easily use external storage. If you want to store documents or need external storage for anything you'll need a file management app to keep track of them, and an online cloud file storage service like MobileMe (expensive) or Dropbox (free but limited to 2 GB, or pay for more)\n- Where you can just close a laptop to protect its screen, you'll need a case to protect the iPad. I highly recommend getting one. To save some money, try a cover/case intended for iPad 1, assuming you don't care that the rear camera will be covered up. A lot of them still fit and work great, such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Griffin-Elan-Passport-for-iPad-Black/dp/B003CKAQ7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Griffin Elan Passport for iPad - Black</a>, and since they're for an old model they'll be discounted\n- You can watch videos/TV episodes/movies on it, but unless you bought them in iTunes, it's a big fat pain to find a converter for them and transfer them to iTunes. This is especially annoying for DVDs/Blu-Rays that have digital copy. You've already paid for the movie and have a digital file but you can't transfer it to your iPad without having to jump through a ton of hoops or buying expensive programs or apps! Not all media companies have this problem, though. When you redeem a digital copy from Disney, you can choose to get an iTunes version, which is perfectly compatible with the iPad. I have Up, Toy Story 3 and Wall-E, and getting them on the iPad was hassle-free. Conversely, Warner Brothers only offers Windows Media versions of the Harry Potter series for digital copy. Transferring to iPad is possible but you need to find programs that remove the DRM, resize to iPad resolution, and convert to Quicktime format. Good luck with that.\n\nDespite all that, the iPad 2 is worth getting if you can spare the cash, and more importantly, if you anticipate actually using it. I don't think it's worth getting for games alone, but if you're a gamer, there are lots of great, cheap games out there. Many of them are even multiplayer, though I haven't tried it, since most of my friends don't have iPads and interoperability between iPad and iPhone versions of games is slim to none (board games like Scrabble and Carcassonne tend to support iPad/iPhone interoperability though).\n\nThe thing is, though, I got this as a gift. Would I have gotten it if I actually had to plunk down the $500+? Honestly, probably not. The lack of many features without having to buy expensive apps and accessories is a real deal-breaker for me (and subtracts a star from my rating). Plus, though I understand why Apple doesn't like Adobe Flash, they really need to get over it since there are large parts of the web that don't work without it. It may be bad for battery life, but why not just have the option to turn it on and off as needed, then? Still, if money is no object for you, it's a slick, entertaining device, and you'll enjoy it quite a bit. Just don't expect it to replace anything you already have; the iPad is in a niche market that the iPad itself created."}

The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next.  In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands.  I still wouldn't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive.  Try not to drop it though.\n\nThe addition of 2 cameras was expected.  Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras.  Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2.  The cameras do a reasonable job, but they're not going to replace a dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images.  The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad.  For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you'd rather, kind of like the Jetson's TV/Phone.  With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world (provided they're on a wireless network at the time).  FaceTime doesn't work over 3G natively (it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon.  This is probably a good thing though.  It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or Mac it's a lot of fun.\n\nSmart Covers aren't really \"smart\" but they're really very useful.  Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations.  You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2.  It's unfortunate that this same feature can't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I wouldn't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it's hard to understand why they've not been there since the beginning.\n\nMultitasking Support\nOne of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support.  Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device's success and released an OS update that included the feature.  The iPad 2 capitalizes on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well.  That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it's more akin to showing off.\n\nApps\nOne thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability.  The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2.  The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses.  There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing.  Chances are if you can dream it, there's an App for that (and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the gap).  The Android market is making a strong showing, and ultimately it'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet.\n\nPros:\nWeight.  Seriously.  The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion.  It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long.\n\nBattery Life.  From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook.  That's better than a work day and that's constantly on.\n\nBooks.  This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way.  The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle.  This allows for some comparison shopping and price competition (although for the most part they're all usually about the same).  Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you don't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window.  If you're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet.\n\nCons:\nStill no dedicated USB support.  While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage.  Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider.  The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files.  Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well.\n\nStill no dedicated SD card slot.  This is troublesome on two fronts.  First, if you want to import pictures from your camera you have to have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around.  Second, the lack of expansion means you're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage.  I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity wasn't an issue.  If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements.\n\nHDMI output.  Really this is a Pro and a Con.  The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter.  All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in.  This can be a pain, but then again if you're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you're not paying for something you won't use.\n\nNo Flash Support.  This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites, but there are a lot still out there relying on Adobe's Flash to run properly (including a lot of web based games).  Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not.  If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they'll have at least some Flash support.\n\nIf you're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list.  If you're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can.  Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Don't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release.  They're exciting and new, and they're impressive enough to warrant some excitement, but it will die down and there will be other products that prove a strong competitor to the iPad 2.  If you're looking for right now though, this is probably your best bet.  I gave the device 4 stars, as I did the iPad 1.  I did this in contemplation of the features offered by competitors that are absent from the iPad, most notably the requirement for adapters for USB/SD/HDMI.  While these features are there, they aren't as convenient as in other tablets.  With that in mind I firmly believe that the iPad more than makes up for this in usability, reliability, and design and in those areas far exceeds its current competitors."}

If you had the first one and moved to the 2nd one, it's worth the move. I made a back up of the original and after going through iTunes everything just moved right over. Made a few tweeks here and there but otherwise it was painless.\n\nAs far as the size goes, it's definently lighter than the first one and it's really lighter than the XOOM, which I had a chance to play around with on Saturday. Also due to the size, it feels like it swims around in the original's case so you definently will want a new one. With the new case, Apple really wants you to show off the sleekness of the device which is cool, but you want to take advantage of having AppleCare in case you accidentally drop it and it breaks. When things get smaller and slimmer, it always tends to feel more fragile. My complaint about the exposure is the back of the iPad which I can see being scuffed in a few weeks so I may get something to protect the back of it. Otherwise, this truly looks like a slate.\n\nIt does feel speedier when loading up apps and as far as gaming goes, some like Infinity Blade and Shadow Guardian really gets a boost from the extra speed. They look much better and the loss of framerate is not as noticable as the iPad 1's.\n\nThere is however still a bit of barely noticable stutter in some movies shown via Netflix when streaming which makes me hope that the next gen iPad has the Retina Display or something better for true on the go HD viewing.\n\nThe cameras, while not the best ( I still don't see someone trying to do serious photography with this so this is not a big deal for me) still does very great with Face Time support. I demoed it a few times with one of my friends who also had the ipad 2 (as well as the iPhone 4) and people who has never seen Face Time in action were astounded. This was the video phone that we only imagined back in the 60s and 70s.\n\nThere is still no SD Slot, no Thunderbolt support however the battery still holds a charge ( I just charged mine for the first time last night) and the screen is more bright and crisp than that of the XOOM.\n\nApple has done a good job at taking the next step with the iPad and any competitor that had something coming out this year really need to take notes because if they don't move swiftly enough, Apple will dominate the tablet space in a similar fashion as they did the mp3 space with the iPod.\n\nIf you had the first one ther are a few small surprises that you are in for, if this is your first one, you will be amazed about what you have missed out on."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The Compromiser\n\n  If you're someone who wants the name brand quality of Apple, but does not want to spend hundreds of dollars on a new IPad, then this is the ideal product for you. It can do everything that a new version can do, but costs under 100$ used. Also, If you have any other Apple products this is will be a lovely addition to your collection. You can sync it with your Mac, IPhone, or Apple watch and have all your apps and information together synced on the same cloud. It is perfect for the Apple aficionado on a budget looking for the best compromise between performance and price.\n\nTech Specs, Battery Life, and Durability\n\n While it may only be the second generation Ipad, it still has the very fast processing power of 1.0 GHz and 512 MB of RAM. You will not even notice you're using an older generation Ipad because it can also handle current ios software. It comes used, meaning it has a few minor scratches on the back, but this is not an issue if you're going to buy a case for it. With the case it looks, feels, and acts brand new!\n Even without the case this Ipad is extremely durable and can survive the wear and tear of life. You will notice it does not scratch easy as only the highest of falls or the deepest of cuts will penetrate its outer exterior and touch screen. The battery life is excellent as well; you can expect it to last all day on a nightly charge. Apple tech specs state that this device has a battery life of ten hours, and this is continuous usage of surfing the web, streaming, or playing music.\n\nFinal Considerations\n\n It comes safely sealed in custom made protective bubble wrap, therefore you can expect it to arrive safe and sound on your doorstep in two business days if you're a Prime member. It is not the biggest or the fastest Ipad to date, but buying used saves you anywhere from $400-$500 if you bought it new. Not only do you save hundreds, you also can do almost everything that the newer generations can do. If you're looking for a device for basic tablet uses such as streaming, surfing the web, listening to music, using apps, making Face time calls, checking email, etc. this Ipad will do it all."}

Had to bring it to the Apple store to reboot it and then the iPad had an activation lock on it from the previous owner. The only way to unlock it is by either contacting the previous owner and hope that they are willing to share their Apple ID and password with you. Which, for the record, no one will do. The alternative is issuing a hard-reset, which requires a valid proof of purchase (i.e. receipt with serial number).\n\nWhen you purchase a device from this retailer, they will NOT issue a receipt with a serial number. There is no way to know for sure whether the device you buy is stolen, repurposed or marked as lost. When you receive an iPad that is stolen, scrapped or lost, it will become completely useless to you and you will have wasted $270. Just don't do it.\n\nDigitBargain has a simple return policy; they don't do it. Aside from the 'sketchy' their device management practices, their customer service is equally useless. They barely speak English and completely fail to understand any issue you may experience. As a matter of fact, they have actually stopped responding to my emails. I am very surprised that this retailer is allowed to sell on Amazon, I thought there were standards.\n\nAnyhow, I received a nice $10 promotional code from Amazon for my 'inconvenience' and unfavorable experience. Thanks, Amazon!\n\nDid I mention that you should not purchase an iPad from this company? Well, you shouldn't.\n\n- MK"}

The item was not acceptable as a gift from Santa... buyer beware. Completely worn out back plate, main button not straight and installed right, edges are all chipped off or bent.\n\nI asked for a retuen and was given a \"canned\" answer and pushed out the door.\n\nSite did not provide example of \"their\" definition of damage. If we saw this one the site we would have clicked to the next option in a second."}

Several scratches on the screen and the back of one, and they were not consistent in their set-up with regards to iOS versions and on screen appearance. I would expect that ordering two of the exact same iPads from the same company would equate to a standard product that would not require so much of my time in making them \"equal\", but that was not the case. One is clearly more superior than the other."}

The tablets were great, but unfortunately the cords that were included were some cheap third party cord and not at all compatible with the iPads.  They looked fine, but when I put them in the iPads to recharge them after loading them up with Apps, The 2 iPads were swell, but the charger cords are not compatible.  When plugged in the iPads went nuts, jumping from app to app and almost screwing them up.  Fortunately I own an iPad2 and used my cord to recharge the gift iPads, but I had to buy 2 new cords from Apple at a cost of 19 bucks each!  I feel very ripped off right now!"}

Last Thursday I tried to bring it up and got nothing, just a black screen. After a few hours of research my husband figured out that the iPad itself was working but the display wasn't. He said it was the \"backlight\". He found a few articles on the web that suggest to give the iPad a slap on the backside, each time he did the screen would light up...He decided to drop the iPad flat on its back on the carpet from about 4'...The Apple logo came up and the iPad has been working fine since.\nSo yes a pretty good product when it worked but rather flaky IMO."}

Although it's an early model (2nd generation) it contains updated software so is compatible with every app I want to load. The camera also is amazing, considering this was the first iPad to have a camera. It's all in the software updates, which are truly awesome.\n\nHad a small issue when, on day 2, the iPad stopped working and began to ask me for a passcode. I have an iTunes password, but it wanted a passcode. The former owner must have programmed one in and I could not get around it. Contacted the seller, who emailed me directions on how to restore the iPad to factory settings, and it has been working perfectly ever since.\n\nIf you are choosing between getting an inexpensive tablet or a used/refurbished iPad, don't hesitate to do the latter. Apple quality can't be beat. And although the seller did not state that this model was \"refurbished\", it was stamped as such when it arrived. Highly recommend!"}

Don't get this one.\nThis iPad is so laughably bad that you'd be better off doing any of those things on your mobile than this thing. Go ahead, cruise Facebook as long as you can before it crashes. Get lucky and find some way the app won't crash? Don't worry, if you find something you want to click on--a video, an article, or even a post you simply want to read all of--this device will find a way to crash it.\nYou may be thinking: \"well, maybe it's the app and not the device.\" Wrong. Open the settings app and watch it crash; open Netflix and watch it crash; hell, open a jigsaw puzzle app...and watch it crash. They all crash.\nBut worry not! Apple has just the fix. You will only need to update the OS software 3 times per week. None of which will fix any of the app issues, but will allow Apple to say you agreed to mandatory arbitration 3 times a week for years.\nBesides all the app problems, this thing is stupidly slow. This is now an older model, but having been gifted it when it was new, I'll tell you it was always like this. I like to use a four-digit pass code for my iPad. Sometimes, this device will take damn near 30 seconds to load the numbers I hit and unlock the device, only to lag and not allow me to scroll between screens.\nWant to turn the screen to landscape view? Sorry, you'll have to shake it to recognize the change, making you look like you're having a seizure in the meantime. Don't want the screen to rotate because you're in the middle of something? Sorry, only when you don't want it to rotate will the slightest direction change make the screen rotate.\nI give 2 stars only because sometimes, when the device isn't being a bigger pain-in-the-rear than Donald Trump, it can be a joy to use. But remember, turn off all the things that make this device worth having; background app refresh for things like email, high-quality videos because the device slows down, way down, and social media apps because reasons.\nI would recommend an old roadkill shovel over this device. Suck it Apple fan boys."}

It takes longer to charge it from 0% - 100% then it does to play with it. I think it took at least 6 hours to fully charge from 0% and then after 3 hours of using it, it was out of power already. I really wish I could afford  an ipad pro but i guess i'll wait another 5 years for that one to be discontinued and thus price drop.\n\nupdate:9-6-16 After using this for a while and purchasing new chargers and more powerful adapters, the fastest I could get this to charge is 10% per hour. Sooo...that means 10 hours to fully charge from 0%. Seems ridiculous."}

Some will have more scuffs, dents and scratches and some may not operate properly. This looks to be in very good condition , as described.  It came with a wall charger in a plain white box. The set up was so easy. I did not need to use a computer to connect to itunes. Yay! That was a concern to me as I now own a Chromebook.  I never had luck with anything refurbished. My son's ipad 2 just broke and I wanted a cheap replacement, until he gets the mini for Christmas.  For  a little over $100, it seems to be in good working order. The apps seem to open at a slight touch. No delay detected yet. Its only our first day using it. It came 75% charged. I love Apple products. I owned many tablets such as Samsung and I keep coming back for an Apple.  Give it a try. If you are a Prime member, you can return at no cost if unhappy."}

There a clue how this review will go:\n1) the wifi adapter was NOT working, had it trying to connect to multiple devices, wifi @ work, hot spot (T-Mobile), home wifi. It would sometimes briefly connect then drop as if stick in search mode, it would not stay connected. I had it sitting next to the hot spot and it showed 1 bar reception. Take a literal 3 steps away and it sees nothing...\n2) Seller tried to tell me she got on Netflix with it before she sent it, I have the emails from her. Uh, no liar you didn't do that. I'm a programmer, I checked. Who are you fooling?? Is that a believable story to you??\n3) The glass screen was not properly installed, the rubber seal behind it was coming out of the body (you shouldn't see this at all) and it literally had 2 HAIRS IN THE SCREEN!! What the what?Eyelash length, and disgusting. Furthermore, I could literally put a sheet of paper between the screen and body of the iPad on one corner. If I could upload the images from my phone I would (no option to). Just like people seeking attention who tell you they are \"crazy\" are not (and we know that), this \"honest and strait forward\" seller is far from her opinionated self-title.\n\nI did get my money back, but I always see justice through (meaning it was a process). I'm not the type of person others get over on. BUYERS BEWARE."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "A friend bought my wife an iPad 2 as a present. I was amazed at how skinny this thing is - but there is a downside to this as well. First the good: light weight, skinny, and we opted for the wifi only model so we wouldn't worry about a monthly cell bill. My wife had a korean chat/email/talk program put on it, and she enjoyed that function of it. The camera function was also fairly neat, especially when she figured out how to zoom in and out of the pictures.\n\nThe downsides: the skinny construction makes this very fragile when dropped. The first time, we thought it was broken forever, (just a black screen, and wouldn't turn on) before I looked online and found a fix: place it face down on the floor and kneel on the back of it. The second time, the screen was a grainy pixeled red. tapping it on the back changed the red to green, and then went black. So it is apparent that one or more cables or chips are knocked loose inside.\n\nThe skinny size also has a second downside - you have to hold it somehow, and if you grip it around the edge of the screen, you can keep the touch screen from working properly if you don't notice your thumb touching the glass front. And of course if you just rest it in the palm of your hand, it is prone to dropping. It also has a nice yet annoying feature of auto-rotating the screen depending on its orientation - I ended up having to turn this off so my wife wouldn't throw it through the wall.\n\nApps are installed through the official Apple app store, which pretty much requires you to setup an Itunes account, so you lose a bit of your privacy there, and you are limited to what Apple decides you can put on your iPad, unless there is some secret way to root the thing.\n\nAll in all,the iPad 2 turned out tt be a mixed bag - looks beautiful, with lots of neat apps to keep you busy, but darkness lies beneath the surface. For official repairs at an authorized dealer you can also expect to pay between half of the original price and the full price - lovely. Throw in the limited competition forced by the app store and the erosion of your privacy, and the design itself pretty much guarantees the average consumer will be throwing additional money towards repairs."}

I filed it down some as it was catching the skin, very sharp. It's an older Ipad so it's not as responsive and quick as the new ones. But still a great product. For the price I'm very pleased! Reduction in stars due to the damage on the case being left as is. It's right there by the screen almost touching it already..

Two versions have\n succeeded the iPad 2. It's more wise to spend a few thousands more and go for\n the iPad 4 which will come out soon.\n\nThe iPad 2 or any other iPad for that matter, is a great companion, a fun device which you can buy if you have extra money to spend. However if you need to do hardcore work, go for laptops"}

This is a great tablet for searching the web and playing games. There also a lot of downloadable apps from the Apple App Store and a number of different albums from iTunes. I have not upgraded my iPad 2 to iOS 9.3.1, due to the iCloud actviation problems and won't upgrade to a new software on this device anytime soon. Features you have on the iPad 2 are these\n1. 720p Camera\n2. FaceTime\n3. Photo Booth\n4. Safari (Internet)\n5. iTunes Store\n6. Apple App Store\n7. YouTube app (iOS 4.2.1 to iOS 6 on iPad 2)\n8. Game Center\n9. Photos\n10. Mail\nand more!\nIf you are going to buy this iPad model, Siri and voice dictation aren't features and you're stuck with having to type. Anyway, this iPad is great if you are using it for simple purposes only, such as searching the web, taking photos/videos, playing games/using apps, and listening to music."}

After a few years of abuse, mine finally did.\n\n I don't work for Apple, I don't own Apple Stock. As a matter of fact, I was anti-apple for years. I finally jumped over to the iphone recently. I believe using this ipad had a lot to do with that decision.\n\nThe white seems to be better on the eyes than the black. My 1st gen, was black. I feel more fatigued when looking at that screen for long periods of time compared to this white one. The iPad 2 is pretty thin and light. I like its tapered edge, which feels more comfortable than the bulky original ipad. For a tablet device designed to be held, that's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done a pretty good job at fitting better components into a smaller space than before. In addition to the tapered edge, Apple managed to reduce the overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, but the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation is heavy and bulky compared to the 2nd gen."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "My 1st issue is that the plug & charger were a joke. The Lightning charging cord wouldn't insert in either direction & on my 3rd try it went 1/2 in & broke as I pulled it out. I went to Apple Store & spent $19.95 for a cord. Then I tried to plug the board into the plug it came with & it didn't work at all.  Fortunately I was able to use the new cord w my iPhone plug.  SO - one of the main reasons I decided to buy this refurbished ipad2 from this vendor was that I could save all the expense of buying chargers - Nope!  BTW, the cord & converter were both brand new, cheap knock off brands.  As far as the refurbished iPad2 - it's ok I guess.  It looks new, clean screen & it is exactly as described - it's good for email, internet search, pintrest, YouTube - I'm not a gamer so not sure about that.  Takes a long time to charge (several hours) & gets very slow if I have too many apps - so I deleted FB app & a few others. I wish I had bought something newer w hi-resolution, but this is ok - except the charger thing wasn't cool.  Don't let ur buying decision be based on that - just plan to go buy them at Apple Store or use ur iPhone charger if it will fit."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Pros: light & thin (impressively thin), great battery life (10 hours of use as advertised), screen is big, clear, and sharp.  The guts (cpu, ram, etc.) are quick and stable.  Sensitivity is great.  With a full wrap case, it responds to every touch.  Sturdy and durable, but with a case it's even better. Love this thing (and no I'm not an apple fan boy, used to be anti Apple but products like this got me hooked!)\n\nCons: speaker.  The speaker is pointed away from the user.  Which makes it quite for the user and louder for everyone around th user.  Need external speaker for music and what not, and head phones if you are planning to use it while others watch tv or whatever.  Also the storage is sort of small.  I'd say it's worth the extra $ for a bigger hard drive.  64 is best value, but the 32 is decent.\n\nThis IPad is fantastic!  Insanely thin, yet still very sturdy.  Screen is sharp, and clear.  As to its size, it's as big as I can be, and still be portable.  Comfortable and big enough for adult size hands, yet still small enough for my 6 year old to use.  Extremely light! And the battery life is great.  I didn't believe that it would really have a 10 hour battery life as advertised, but I sit here corrected.  The battery is no joke and really gives you 10 hours of actual use.  My only hang up (with all I (pad, touch, phone etc.) is the speaker.  While it produced sharp crisp sound it is pointed away from the user.  This diminishes the volume levels a lot as far as what you hear while using it, while it is extremely loud to any one sitting around you.  If I want to watch something or play a game while my wife is watching tv, I have to use head phones.  The sensitivity on the touch screen is perfect.  Not sure yet if you can adjust it or not, but it's at a perfect level just the way it is.  It is sensitive enough that with a full case/ screen protector it reacts to every touch still.  I would recommend strongly to buying a great quality full protection case, and decent external speaker, and a good set of head phones.  As far as storage, the 32 gig should be the minimal.  I can fill up 16 gigs very quickly, so it's worth it even for casual use to get something bigger than the 16 gigs.  64 gig is the best value, but the 32 is still respectable.  So far so good.  I love this thing.  Bought it for my son, but fell in love with it.  Buying a second one for myself!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I recently bought the I-pad 2 in order to attempt to keep up with school. It offers fantastic apps for keeping up with school as well for entertainment. The device also offers great battery life as well as portability\nThe I-Pad is backed by the app store which is the central hub for application developers to create some incredibly useful tools. The app store shines when it comes of ease of use. Instead of having to go through pages on internet to find a specific application that I need I can quickly find them through the app store and they will be supremely cost efficient as well.\n Allowing application developers an open platform to present some of their amazing ideas doesnt only assist with school; it can also lead to fun and often addictive forms of entertainment. The I-Pad comes backed with apples I-Tunes giving you an infinite selection of music to download and play. If you don't want to pay the small fee either you can download other applications that allows you to listen to music for free. They also offer a wide array of movies that are played with excellence 10 inch screen size.\n The I-Pads versatility is not to be overlooked either. Its compact size allows for great portability without needing a laptop bag or anything to big. . Its battery life is incredibly long lasting me 2 days at times without a charge using it in almost every class and studying from 8 AM to 6PM. Though I do recommend that you should put some sort of protective case over it because it can be quite fragile. There is an also an issue presented that if it does run of battery that it may actually stay off and won't turn back on unless you do a factory reset. This means you lose all of your data but with cloud storage this doesnt pose that huge of a problem.\nThe I-Pads few glitches pale in comparison to the benefits this product can offer. For a student like myself it has been one of my main tools for studying, doing homework, or taking notes in class. The seemingly endless list of applications and songs offer unlimited entertainment as well. The portability and batter life only add to its ease of use as well."}

I grew aggravated with them after he gave me countless links unrelated to the problem. I would advise others looking to purchase an iPad from this seller to look elsewhere.  The price, while seemingly affordable, is not worth the hassle that you may have to deal with to set up the I pad. I am not the type of person to write reviews but this was absolutely ridiculous.

We just purchased a 128 MB card for his tablet to see if that helps. He had been wanting a Ipad for a while, several of his friends at school have one and it seems to run smoother in his eyes.

I did receive what appears to be an authentic, new unit and it seems to be working well so far. Mine came with IOS 8 and I upgraded it to IOS 9. The only oddity is that my units model number is FC984B/A whereas the seller advertises the model as MC984LL/A. So, I am not sure what exactly I got. When I google the FC984B/A model to see details, the only result I get is on amazons UK site.

It constantly crashes and doesn't respond fast at all to typing. It's very laggy. From everything I read I believe its so laggy because the update. I was hoping apple would fix the problem but no ios update has. This leads me to believe apple wants everyone to go out and  purchase there new products. There older models will not function properly because they are older and less. I would give this product 2 1/2 stars but that isn't an option."}

I decided that buying an I pad would be easy on the go.\n\nIve had apple products in the past; the programing has always worked perfect because its easy and simple. I have had previous apple product break easily. So, buying the product put me a little on edge. However Ive had the devise for about five months and I haven't had any problems with it. I have younger sisters who frequently play games on it and theyve dropped it several time. It still in perfect condition, I bought a case for it and they are extremely affordable compared to retail price.\n\nIve enjoyed my I pad because its easy to use. I bought one of the oldest versions of the I pads; however, being able to update helps me with what I need. The only big difference I see with my older I pad compared to the newer I pads is that its heavier and the picture quality isn't the best. I bought the product used, but in perfect condition. If you're looking for something simple and to get the job done, I pad 2 generations will do it!\n\nDelivery\nMy I pad took a longer than expected to arrive; however with Amazon you can easily track your orders so you know where it is at.  The delivery date was only a couple days later. Also, Amazon has a great return policy if the product doesnt work."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "If you are international students who are considering to purchase the first tablet, this review is very useful! It is because I was in the same situation like you two years ago, and now I am very glad that I purchased the iPad.\n\nUnlimited Books Can Be Purchased From Anywhere\nAs an international student, I believe you wished that you could read more books in your first language. An iPad will solve your problem! When I started using it for the first time, I was skeptical about reading books with the tablet. However, surprisingly, it was very easy to read. The size of screen is big enough and the size of fonts can be adjusted so that it was so much more comfortable to read books on iPad than on iPhone.\n\nThese days, I even believe that reading ebook on iPad is more convenient than on paper version because most of books can be purchased online, and they are cheaper than the paper version. Once books are purchased, all of them will be downloaded on your iPad permanently so that you do not need to carry many books from your home country any more!!\n\nGreat Support for Classes\nHeavy reading assignments are challenging for international students. However, my iPad has been very useful for those assignments. For example, if there is an unfamiliar vocabulary on a homework PDF file, iPad gives you the translation of the word by simply touching it. Therefore, you can keep reading the file without guessing the meaning of unfamiliar words. In addition, since iPad is quite light, and the battery lasts about 10 hours without charging, you can access to reading materials anywhere and anytime. Because of this portability, you can read assignments in a small portion at a time instead of reading files in front of a computer for many hours.\n\nI have been using my iPad every day since I purchased it, and I cannot imagine my school life without having it. This is how much my iPad helped my college life and that is why I am giving 5 stars for the evaluation. If you want to read books in your first language or have difficulty of reading assignments, I highly recommend you to purchase the iPad. It is a powerful tool to change your college life dramatically. By using it, I hope you will have a wonderful time studying overseas!!"}

It would charge up to 100  percent. But it would go down In charge even though it was plugged In. If you unplugged it, it would drop rather quickly. I liked it, IF it only  worked. I am not hard to please. Send me one that works. If you can't . I understand. Then just return my money. Thank you. God bless. Pat"}

My cell phone is an android so I thought I would have trouble navigating an Apple but when I turned it on, it was so simple to operate.  I am still exploring the different options it contains but so far, so good.  It is light weight and has the perfect size screen.  I have face-timed my family across the country and there was no lag time.  I could see and hear them perfectly.  I think that is the best feature.  I would definitely recommend the Apply iPad 2, 2nd generation."}

Has had extensive continuous use since.  Grand kids are entertained for hours while they are here and they borrow it for road trips with their parents.  Bought an inexpensive kid-proof case (from Amazon) in bright pink so the tablet is easy to find and relatively indestructible.  If the seller reads this, he will cringe to discover his pampered i-pad has become a kid's toy, so he may be pleased to know that I downloaded all my kindle books onto it and my wife has read a couple of them so far (even though she has a Kindle Fire and Kindle unlimited subscription).

The only thing that has been affected so far is really the speakers. They aren't nearly as loud as my iphone 6 plus but overall this is a great product. This is why Apple charges what they do, this product still looks great and works great.

So when I found this one at such a good price, I found it a little odd that it was so cheap, but it was a deal I simply couldn't pass up. BIG MISTAKE. The product was defective from the moment I got it, but after syncing it with iTunes and several hours of work I finally got it to activate. After that it worked fine except for a few minor bugs, but I generally never expect an electronic device to work perfectly. But after several months it started shutting down until finally it collapsed altogether. I took it to several repair stores, but there was nothing that could be done. I tried to return it, but the return date had long since expired. Finally I resorted to mailing it back to Apple. I was given a replacement product, and have been extremely happy with it. I beg you save your time and money and avoid this seller at all costs. The iPad is absolutely great. The seller......not so much."}

She had to rotate to landscape to be able to type, and eventually had to avoid the right quarter (as seen in portrait view) of the touch screen no matter what, which meant rotating very often to touch a responsive region.

(Opted for free shipping.) Cosmetically you cannot tell it is used. It looks & operates like it's Brand New!! In my opinion, It runs excellent!!  I would highly recommend this seller. I am extremely happy with this purchase and for the reasonable price!  I found out it does not come equipped with a SIM card. Also, if you run it off of wifi, you don't need a SIM card. I called AT&T they explained that you don't necessarily need a SIM card. If you want to pay for monthly service, they will give you a SIM card for free. Prepaid monthly service  is about $50/mo. Then you would have wifi while roaming. Overall, pleased with my purchase and definitely money well spent.  -Julie P  Hartford CT"}

Because it is an older version it doesn't have the capacity to hold some of the games we would play on the phone or other tablets.  It pretty much serves well for emails, or watching Netflix.\n\nThat is not to say the newer version of this product wouldn't be amazing.  I think for future reference if I were to purchase an apple product or any future technology purchases it would be a wise idea to get the more up to date technology.

The iPad is a great tool for communicating, running apps, surfing the web, and reading email.  I do wish apple would have included siri with the iPad.  Hands free interaction with the device would have been helpful on the move.  It could have been so much more.\n\nI run numbers, facebook, pages, and instant messaging on the iPad.  I like iMovie editing and found the software to be very reliable on the hardware.  You will need to buy ear head set to listen to music.  The built in speakers are not very loud.  The microphone is adequate but not great.  I found the dragon voice recognition system made too many errors to be useful.  I use webreader to listen to my stories.\n\niPhoto is great.  I wish it could find people by voice command.  This is a feature I look forward to using.\n\nEmail interface is great.  You send alot of time tapping to remove obsolete emails\n\nNo viruses.  Yeah\n\nIBooks works well on the iPad.  I wish that iBooks was capable of reading your ebook\n\nMicrosoft remote desktop works on the iPad2.  I wish that rd worked with a tap interseption capability rather than a drag and arrow click.  It takes time to navigate.\n\nthe iPad 2 screen is ok.  It smears easily.  A new nano material that resists smearing needs to be developed."}

I have recommend this option as oppose to going to a cell store and adding it a plan.  Her apps that she uses I have placed on the ipad.  She doesn't need cell service to use these apps when we are traveling.  So having it and using my wifi at home is a perfect option for us."}

They have now upgraded their app and now it runs very slowly and not efficiently on the iPad.  I have other tablets that are also superior to this iPad.  I thought when I purchased it, albeit reluctantly that I would be seeing the gold standard in tablets and was thoroughly disappointed.  It's ok.  Maybe newer versions are better I can't comment on that."}

I bought this iPad because I needed a tablet that I could use for general college use and watching streaming video.\n\nAs of today, it's my 4th day with this tablet and I enjoy it! I bought it off Amazon, used, in \"Acceptable\" condition. Because it was used there was a significant discount, but of course I felt trepidation. I worried that it would arrive cracked, or otherwise in substandard condition. However, when it DID arrive the only nicks were minor and near the charging port, as well as some tiny sticky residue on the back (like someone had removed a sticker). Everything else was working fine: the home button was responsive, the speaker and microphone functioned well, and after a brief syncing with my iCloud, all my photos and contacts were imported with relative ease. There was a charger included as well!\n\nThe tablet is lightweight and intuitive. Of course, I am buying a case and screen protector to keep my investment safe. But my first buying experience with Amazon was great, and so far this \"Acceptable\" condition tablet has been preforming fine."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "This arrived on time but looks like a hamster chewed the aluminum casing all the way around with breaks in the edges. The screen has blemished areas as well. It has MUCH more than minor wear, it has clearly been pried open or something, and not neatly. I have a first generation Ipad I am replacing with this and it is older and has no signs of wear. No chewed up casing or blemishes in the screen so I expected the \"normal signs of wear\" to be similar to mine. This seems cosmetic and the screen issue isn't major, just some lighter areas."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Ignorance is bliss. I work at BestBuy and people always ask me \"APPLE or ANDROID.\" Of course it depends on the user and most people who come in the store weren't technologically savvy. So, the majority of people wanted something easy to pick up and learn. Therefore, the majority of my recomendations were the iPad. I am in college and I have an internship. Both of these roles I use the iPad in. I am even using my iPad right now. I have a Macintosh computer and I found myself using my iPad for the majority of my computing needs. The iPad has also paid itself off by the cost of Text Books alone. Every book I get on my iPad saves me on average about $100. E text books are much cheaper than buying books on campus. I also have a keyboard case which they sell on Amazon for less $50.00. I use an app called Pages, which is an Apple developed app, that allows me to edit, import and export Word Documents. Not to mention its movie and music capabilities. I also invest heavily and the iPad has made my life so much easier when it comes to managing my investments and banking. Overall, the iPad has been a life saver for me and my family. Also, another great product that is a must have is a Zagg Invisible shield. They are a little difficult to put on but they have instructional videos on how to do it. Thanks for reading."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I've had my iPad 2 (this is my second one by the way) for a while (maybe 2 years?). Anyways, I was surprisingly a little disappointed. This isn't Apple's greatest product, that's for sure. Its slow, constantly crashes, and it pretty much useless. Also, you may think 16 GB is enough space, but even if you have an abundance of cloud storage or don't plan on storing much on the device, I can assure you that you'd be wise to get an iPad with more than just 16 GB. Its truly not as much as you'd think. I keep very, very little on the device, as I store nearly everything in the cloud, and I don't ever take/store photos on this iPad, but even so, I'm constantly having to delete things in order to install the latest update. This is incredibly inconvenient and so annoying!"}

I didn't mind that it was 3 years old, I just wanted a nice tablet that I can browse the internet on because my 2008 is getting slow and can't run multiple programs at once, which makes it difficult to use iPhoto and/or photoshop while online. So after I bought it I was really looking into the reviews and thought it was odd how long and detailed the reviews were. I clicked on the one star reviews and got a bad feeling. Most of them were how they bought it labeled \"new\" but it was damaged or something was wrong with the system, or that they got it extremely late. I started to think the 5 star reviews were spam and it was a big scam and noticed some of the accounts said the same thing on multiple items. My delivery date came and went and was really worried I wasted my money. The next morning it came, and i was happy it wasn't at least extremely late. I got it \"packaged sealed\" and opened it up. Noticed it didn't have the plastic on the iPad itself like it should but there was no defect physically. It also started up with iOS 7 which is not right considering its a 3 year old iPad. But thankfully it's working great and looks brand new. I don't know if it's with every iPad purchased here or I was just lucky, but I've been using it for 3 days straight and it's been working amazing. Hope this helps."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I purchased an IPad reluctantly as I am trying to get away from Apple products.  Unfortunately I needed an IPad for work since the software my company was using for a project only ran on IPads.  I wanted to spend as little as possible but still get a quality device.  I purchased a refurbished device on Amazon from Instant Replay Electronics (Instantreplayelectronics.com).  It worked fine at first however that quickly changed.  I was having trouble with connecting and staying connected to wifi.  I was in a jam because I had a 30 day warranty from the seller and my meeting where the IPad was required was coming up in a week.  I corresponded with Shane from the seller and was told that they would ship the replacement the next day after they received it.  To their credit, they did just what they promised and I had the IPad for my meeting.  Although I wish the product would not have needed to be returned (I never had good luck with refurbished items), I was pleased that the seller did as promised.  If you are looking for a cheap IPad but are concerned about getting a lemon, this seller stands by his word."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I was very excited to get my new iPad, I would be using it for school and for my personal schedule. When I got the iPad it took a bit longer to charge but once it charged everything was fine. But when I tried to set it up it wouldn't detect any wifi even though I had a connection on all my other devices like my iPod and laptop.\nEven at school, where wifi was throughout the whole campus, I was having a hard time detecting wifi. I finally got it but I had to hold my iPad very still and it had a one bar connection even though my classmates, who had surfaces, latptops and iPads, had three bars.\nFinally I was able to get wifi connection at my home, however I has to be within 3 yds of the router on the other side of the house which was a little inconvienent for my but I was still able to get my work done so i wasn't complaining too much.\n\nI had tried factory resets, turning it off-waiting- then turning it back on, letting it die on its own, and I even took it into the Apple store; where they did their own reset. And nothing worked. I believe, and the apple workers also thought, that the attenta may have been burnt out, however there's nothing they can do.\n\nI enjoy my iPad, besides having to be very close to the router to get any real work done that requires internet access, everything works great! I'm happy with my purchase but just frustrated with this error."}

The seller was contacted and refused to do anything to reimburse me for the upwards of $400 + that I have spent.\nI caution anyone who is considering purchasing an electronic item, to first, consider buying it new, and DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER..! whatsoever.."}

Being able to buy the Logitech keyboard & cover (refurb) at only $25 made for a total ipad/keyboard/copver package at ~$325 with no shipping and no tax.  All in all, a very good deal from two good suppliers.  Shipping was free and fast on both items."}

I finally decided that I was just going to forget about it. Why do I need a new tablet when I still have my ipad 2?\n\nYou see all these tablets that claim this and that and have thousands of things they can do. Im actually sick of reading about all of them! My ipad already does all of those things. I used mine all through community college now Im in university and I still use it hours every day. I have friends that have other kinds of tablets. One of them has the newest ipad that I like but I was also thinking about a newer kindle which another of my friends has. The kindle is nice and so is the new ipad but when looking at the screens and then looking at my ipad I LIKED my ipad2 screen better than theirs. The colors are better. IDK why. Even my friend said that the color on mine was better than her new ipad even though that one has the newer screen.\n\nIve had mine for 3 years. Although its older, its still great as the new ones just not as great of a screen. The one thing I dislike is the cameras are not as great as some other tablets but I still take a lot of beautiful pictures though. But everything else is great. So, I finally realized that if I was going to buy a new tablet right now I might even buy an ipad 2 again because of how cheap they are now."}

I know it's a fake because my daughter got a Ipad2 for her birthday two years ago.  It's such a big difference. The Ipad2 doesn't show on and off it shows green for on with no words. I didn't order it for my self and I told the person who I purchased it for he said it's ok. I called customer service all I got was smart remarks. I was told \"we have other sellers so we don't know about the products that are being sold\". So I asked how you sell something on your site that you don't know about?  Her response was do you want a refund?  Never Again with Amazon!

It is a step up from my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 when using it on the internet, but the Kindle has been truly reliable and easy to use.\nThe unit arrived with a 3% battery charge so I plugged in the charger and came back to it the next morning to find it at only 74% charge. So I left it for another 24 hours while I searched the net for iPad2 battery issues. It seems everyone feels that these units are slow to recharge. When it finally reached a 100% charge I started learning how to use it. This is not a toy, it really is a computer and has many features that are not readily apparent so I bought an \"iPad For Dummies\" book on Amazon to help me get the most out of my unit. I recommend this to anyone new to an iPad. Recharges now take less time than before. I paid $214.99, including shipping, for this unit and feel like I saved 50% over a new unit. I surf the web, do emails, read my Kindle books on it and am now searching the available Apple apps.\nI feel really great about this purchase and the unit. I worked for a large computer company for 38 years and always had a company laptop or whatever, so going to an Apple product was a big deal for me. Take the plunge!"}

At the same time, I gave my Windows Netbook to my lovely mother :-)  It was her first time with a computer and it didn't go well. Now don't get me wrong, I love Windows and use it every day, but it's hard explaining to a 75 year old why you need security updates and a reboot, or why something is stuck in the Outbox, or many other occurrences.\nUltimately, I decided to upgrade to a newer iPad (go iPad Air!), and I took the Netbook from her, and gave her this instead. Sure, I set up a few things like email, etc. and had to tell her that \"Safari is now your Internet Explorer\", but then she was off!\nThe point is that these things are just so intuitive, that almost anyone can just work them out.

For those of you who don't care, take this review as 5 stars. I found myself needing those ports, but the applications are fantastic. Being a college student, I use Pages, voice recorder, and goodnotes the most, which, by themselves, are amazing applications that help me get through classes with little stress.

Happy for quite  a while, then something happened to ability to connect to home wifi network. All other devices in house continue to work fine. That includes laptops, tablets, printers, DVD player, and Roku. Searched for support online. Found forums full of similar complaints. Lots of potential solutions but none has worked for me. Even purchased an extender for wireless router. As it is I have to sit on floor in front of the router or the extender to get more than a single bar and to access anything including Amazon. I used device to watch Amazon movies on Prime, will not be continuing Prime subscription since this POS won't connect well enough to view anything. Of course it does not have an Ethernet connection so I can't even wire the paperweight to the internet.\nNo apparent solution from Apple in the works as they appear to not recognize the problem is an iPad problem.\nI believe Apple IOS updates have degraded the capability. Probably a corporate decision in order to sell new devices or sell devices with 3G/4G so continuing revenue stream come in from the ISP subscriptions.\n\nI can't believe the lemmings in the Apple market let this company get away with the stunts they pull."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "If you are currently looking for an amazing product that is very reliable then you are looking at it right now. This Ipad 2 is very easy to use and can be used for almost anything. Whether you are at home and just want to play games or watch Netflix or if you are at school and want to take notes, this Ipad can do just about anything. Many people have consumed and reported their personal experiences and for the most part if you own an Ipad 2 you cooler than everyone else who doesnt own one. People will look at you at work or in class and envy you since they don't have one. That is a fact! I encourage everyone to own one of these. It is a purchase I do not regret and I would recommend it to anyone. My whole family owns one from my sister to my cousins and nephews and we are all satisfied with the Ipad 2. It works as a mini computer on the go and you will love it.\n This item is fun to use and is very appealing. The size and weight of it allows you to be able to take anywhere with you. It is much thinner and it has been created to be much faster than other tablets. You will not have to wait for 10 minutes to allow it to turn on , you will be guaranteed fast service from this apple product. There are also multiple languages from which you can choose from to The display of the Ipad is just phenomenal. Its glossy widescreen allows you to see everything very nicely. Theres no doubt the resolution quality is the best! You would want to take pictures and videos everywhere you go. This Ipad has also been created with front and rear cameras so you don't have to only take pictures of others but you can take pictures of yourself. How awesome! So if you and your friend want to take a picture but there is no one around that can do you the favor, there is no need to worry about it because you have this ipad. Adjust the camera to face you and snap away. You can also fix the picture by adding filters or purchasing apps that allow you to fix a picture in anyway whether its adjusting the color and brightness or adding funny stickers or borders. There are thousands of apps you can find that are fun and very useful. Many apps you must pay for but they are usually very cheap and definitely worth it. There are also many free apps that are your usual apps. The app store has thousands of apps specifically for ipads. This allows you to have an enjoyable time when using your ipad. When purchasing your ipad, your item comes with free built in apps. These apps include the camera, calendar, clock, safari and many more general apps you need on a everyday basis. Surfing the web on your Ipad can not get any easier. It was created so that everyone can easily learn from your 4 year old sister to your 70 year old grandmother. The buttons on the exterior of the ipad include the home, volume, and silence key and the hold button. The power and battery life of the ipad is excellent. You can go hours of surfing the web or playing games without having to keep charging it everyday.  For example, I recently went on a trip to San Francisco which took 6 hours. I watched movies on the way there and movies on the way back and didn't have to chrage it during my vacation. It was amazing to be able to use it for so long and not have to keep charging it on my trip. On my trip I was also able to factime my brother who was back at home. With the ipad you can videochat and factime anyone at anytime as long as you have wifi. This allows you to have contact with someone you haven't seen for a while. It allows you to be able to see someone while talking to them at the same time. This for me is the best part of the ipad since It clearly allows me to see my brother who lives far away from me. The Apple Ipad 2 is an excellent product overall. If you are still debating whether or not to purchase an Ipad 2 you should go and play with one hands on first before purchasing. You can go to best buy or an Apple store to witness this marvelous item in action. I give the Ipad 2 five stars because I love it. It is very reliable for anything and the design of it makes it easy to use anywhere you go!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I'll mix it up a little and start with the things I don't like about the iPad 2. I sold my iPad 2 a while back, but I now have an iPad 3 and iPad Air. 4 iPhones, and an iMac.  On the other side of the fence I own a Kindle Fire HDX 7\", and did own a 7\" Lenovo tablet, both of which I like also.  Obviously the only draw-back I can think of with the iPad 2 is the poor resolution, which probably isn't even that big of a deal to some people. To me it's a deal breaker, and that is why I sold my iPad 2, however when I got the iPad 3 and realized how much heavier it was, I actually kind of regretted getting rid of my older version!  I absolutely love the light weight of the 2, ALMOST as much as I love the Retina display of the successive models.  I honestly can't tell any real difference in the speed of the 2, vs. the 3, vs even the Air! I guess I'm not all that much into games anymore, which is probably the only place the upgraded power and speed of the newer iPads would ever come in to play anyway!\n\n  As I mentioned before, the Retina display to me is a very worthwhile tradeoff even for a heavier iPad.  I actually prefer my iPad w/ Retina and keyboard case to a much more expensive Mac book Air, without Retina display. The reason being, no matter how close you set the iPad to your eyes (such as laying in bed with it sitting on your chest, the clarity is just like reading printed material right out of a book, and to me that's more important than a big screen any day of the week! I much prefer the new fire wire charging cables over the 32 pin one that the iPad 2, android tablets, and other phones use.  I hate having to worry about which side is supposed to be up or down...\n\n  The reason I would go with an iPad 2 over any of the other Android tablets, including the Kindle Fire, even though probably all the android tablets have far superior hardware for the same amount of money, is that iEnvironment. iOS, iTunes, iCloud, better quality apps, even from the exact same software on iOS vs. Android.  Owning something from Apple is not about a status symbol or anything like that for me, to me it's like owning a piece of art that makes my heart go pitter-pat every time I pick one up or sit down to relax with one on my chest.  My satisfaction and joy of owning and using such device with such a OS and compatibility with everything in my book is well worth the extra money that Apple charges for their devices.  I'm also very proud to support an American company, versus a Chinese or Korean one... sorry, but do you haters even stop to think that all the Chinese and Korean equipment use poorly paid and poorly cared for cheap labor in China just like Apple does... duh!"}

I upgraded my router and all worked well.  It takes more throughput to run the iPad than to run my laptop, so the it took me a while to troubleshoot since I was still using my laptop wirelessly every day.  I would reset the general settings on iPad, and it would be able to connect to the internet for a bit.  There was an update that I needed, but it crashed the whole thing every time I tried to download it.  Bought a new modem/wireless router at Officemax, hooked all up, and everything is working great!

My biggest complaint (this is more my fault for not researching the product before buying) is that what you buy as far as memory is what you get.  You cannot increase its memory like you can a computer.  We've had to delete video and apps over the past year to make room for more.  My son really hates losing apps from time to time, but we have to if he wants to make room for a new one.  Buy as much memory as you can afford, because after a few months you may find yourself stuck."}

Apple devices are more expensive than other tablets but you really get what you pay for...you are going to be spending a lot of time on your tablet so choose wisely.\n\nA word of advice, if you have small children who will be using this device make sure that you get an Otterbox Defender case.  They will drop it, spill food on it, etc...and the Otterbox case will save you from sending your device back to Apple and forking over $250 for them to fix it"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "My lovely and kind daughters bought me the ipad2 as a birthday present October 2012. In brief you can love 50% of what the product has to offer and you can hate the other 50%.\n\nStrengths: excellent video quality and simplicity ? Docs to Go works fairly well, but not without glitches particularly if your desktop crashes and has to be reloaded. No way to sync the existing \"good files\" That,is supposed to be \"apple easy\" ?\n\nBook reader capability works pretty well. I can listen to mp3 audios or lectures and sermons. But it misses a continue listening where I left off feature. Battery life is decent.\n\nConns: Absolute torture for the over 50 years old crowd. NO usb; TO MAKE ANYTHING WORK OR BE USABLE YOU HAVE TO purchase Apple apps on apple's terms.\n\nTo get initial questions answered I drove 100 miles to the nearest Apple store in Augusta, Georgia on three separate occasions and once there, essentially had to listen to the \"prepared class\" rather than learn how to make the ipad2 immediately productive.\n\nIf you want to the ipad2 to do anything productive, you have to install \"apps\". Pay us and pay us and pay us. Many of the \"free\" ipad apps are very buggy. You are left to read user's reviews and \"try\" out the app which can make you waste 2 hrs of your time because it is not a properly written app and \"hangs\" or crashes. Then you have to \"jump through hoops to get it off Itunes or it will remain on your ipad2. If you have to uninstall it, you waste more time.\n\nAs I said 50% of it is \"slick\" and 50% of it needed three years to get the biggest \"bugs\" out of it.\n\nSafari browser is a difficult and cumbersom adjustment for Windows users. The E-Mail program requires you to relearn EVERYTHING Apple's way. Sound will not automatically play in many or most videos because they are tied to quick time. So now you are forced to buy other apps which may or may not play the video you just stumbled across.\n\nAPPLE ITUNES IS AN ABSOLUTE JOKE. IT IS WRITTEN FOR YOU TO BUY STUFF FROM THEM PERIOD ! The first page that pops up is begging you to buy their songs or videos.\n\nSimply tranferring existing mp3's to the ipad 2 requires you to jump through hoops and waste an unbelievable amount of time.\n\nDocuments to Go works fairly well unless your desktop crashes and you have to reload your desktop. Then, you have no way of simply \"syncing\" the existing files on the ipad2 to a new desktop. An absolute pain in the xxs and waste of time!\n\nThere is NO seemless way to transfer existing password programs to take over in Safari. You have to buy the apple offerred program and I DID NOT find it easy to use.\n\nVideo HAH ! Video plays beautifully BUT ONLY ON THE IPAD. Try and transfer the video elsewhere and you face aggravation. I downloaded the latest quick time to my computer and the download video file (through the cable) WOULD NOT PLAY.\n\nAs I said aggravation. Would I buy one again or recommend the ipad2 ? No. There are cheaper alternatives out there that cost less money. For the money spent here I could purchase a 14 or 15 inch windows laptop computer.\n\nBorn in 1947"}

If you search google by \"WIFI issue on IOS 7\", you can find that a lot of users have the same issue as what I have. After 2 days discussion with Apple support, the solution is to spend $240 for a replacement.\n\nMy IPAD is still pretty new even it is out of warranty. Why do I have to pay couple hundred dollars for the problem caused by using Apple new IOS? Apple made a bad IOS release and you can approve this by searching on Google. However, now Apple is tring to provide a workaround for the issue caused by Apple at the user's cost.

It had a very crisp and unique look, functioned smoothly, and took care of all my entertainment needs. Then I turn it on one day and see I have an update. iOS 7...\n\nSince the update I feel robbed and cheated. Even the simplest of functions(like typing in a 4 digit password) have a lag/delay. The \"new and improved\" graphic design is a total disaster. It looks like a 5 year old was asked to replicate the look of a windows tablet.\n\nWould you like to watch a movie or tv show on your iPad with iOS 7? If you said yes then you'd better grab a pair of oven mitts to hold it with. That's right-now the back gets scalding hot after 30 minutes using it.\n\nFinally we get to the battery life. I spent around 10 minutes writing this review and in that time the battery has gone from 91% down to 83%. Before the update a single charge would last almost an entire week of medium/light use.\n\nMy mother has the same issues with her iPad so it's not that mine is faulty or defective. I want to stress that my problems have been more with the update to iOS 7 than with the iPad itself. If these issues are resolved then I will edit my review and my rating, but as of right now I can't recommend this product to anybody."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "This model came out in March 2011, and me and 3 other family members have had one since June 2011.\nDespite the age of the model it has not become obsolescent like many other gadgets. It runs the latest IOS 7 and apps perfectly. The battery still holds a full charge, and all of the buttons and features still work (I could not say the same about my 4 year old Ipod Touch...).\nI use it primarily for web browsing, email, Facetime and e-books.\nThis model does NOT have a retina display. Although Retina is nice it makes no difference in day to day use, including viewing photos. So what if I can see dots close up? I am certainly not bothered by them.\nSure its fun having the most up to date toy, but having the new Ipad Air would not enhance the enjoyment that I get from the device one bit.\nStill, it seems like chutzpah for Apple to sell an old model for $400, so if I were in the market, I would look at used/refurbished models.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I ordered this particular model because I lost the one I received as a gift.  I don't want the person who gave it to me to find out about the loss.  Also, I cannot afford a new one from Apple.  I chose the vendor Sikksound because of the positive reviews.  I am conditionally pleased with my choice.  The iPad I received was in pristine condition, with an Apple box, charging cord and fast charge plug.  It also came with a textured protective backing.  I discovered that the iPad had been used in Italy because of the formatting and information I found in the settings.  After a series of very courteous and helpful e-mail conversations with Sikksound, I was able to resolve the formatting issues.\n\nHowever, I warn purchasers of used AT&T iPads of an expensive and cumbersome complication.  AT&T uses a SIM card to enable cellular data usage.  When sold by Apple, a new AT&T iPad comes with a SIM card which allows for periodic data usage.  In other words, a cellular data plan may be purchased through the iPad for a month, and then cancelled.  When cellular data is needed again, one can simply by more data for that month, and so on.  Because of it's Italian heritage the iPad I received was equipped with a SIM card incompatible with AT&T in the U.S.  In order for the iPad to use cellular data, a new AT&T SIM card was required.  A local AT&T store installed one without alerting me to the $36 fee, and without explaining that the monthly data plan must be ongoing, or the SIM card is deactivated.  A replacement SIM card from AT&T is not renewable, like the one which comes in a new iPad from Apple.  The AT&T store rep deactivated the SIM card within a few minutes after explaining that the data plan must be ongoing.  I only discovered the $36 charge when my bill arrived.  Luckily AT&T removed it because I had not used any data.\n\nI rarely use cellular data because wi-if is so accessible.  However, for those who want to use occasionally use the cellular capability, you might want to do some more research.  I recommend spending time on the phone with, or visiting an Apple store, to find out your cellular data options."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I got this iPad in October 2011, according to the engraving on the back, and since 2 years seems to be the extent of most gadgets' life these days, I simply had to make a review. A good one, of course.\n\nPROS:\n\nWeight: By far, the most amazing thing about this tablet is that it weighs so little. I believe it weighs less than any other iPad out there, which is weird, but I think the iPad mini is supposed to cater to those who have a problem with that. The iPad isn't meant to be held in one hand, though. It's a real personal computer, only in tablet from, and you must treat it as such. If you need to be able to read in bed or something, get a kindle or iPad mini. However, you'll find that the iPad is very convenient for most uses.\n\nDesign: The front of the iPad is defined by a single pane of multitouch glass - and a home button. The back is made of aluminum. There is a front camera, a rear camera in the top right corner, and a speaker at the bottom. This simplistic design, which Apple litigiously fought for against Samsung, is in a word, magical. I'm not too much into the marketing stuff, but seriously, there is something extremely premium about Apple products, and I am sure it is more than the pseudo philosophical marketing. The Smart Cover actually works really well, though its necessity is... debatable. Overall, this tablet feels like its worth 500 dollars. Ok, so it's 400 now, but you know what I mean.\n\nDurability: The primary user of this tablet is an unhygienic now-9-year-old who is not exactly dexterous and immediately gets on it after school, sin lavar sus manos. If you know glass, you know that the only thing that can really scratch it are minerals. That's right. Not knives or cleats, though they may if you try hard enough. It's finger salts, salt from food, dust, dirt, sand, jewelry like diamonds and quartz. However, today I wiped off all the prints with a damp hand towel and I could count, I kid you not, 3 micro scratches. That's amazing. This tablet has been dropped, probably not from extreme heights, but still. The glass at the corners, along with the aluminum housing, is tattered. There are several deep scratches in the aluminum on the back. However, there are no functional damages to this tablet. That's also very nice. You probably don't need the Smart Cover for its protective aspect. You will however, want it so you can use it for support. It helps a lot.\n\nDisplay: Eek. I'll kick it to you straight; the resolution of this screen is terrible. If your going to be looking at pictures, you're going to be disappointed. 1024x768 doesn't cut it. My 4.5 inch S2 had a resolution of 800x640. I thought it was sub par, but acceptable. The iPad is just bleh. It's colors are amazing though. I don't know too much about outdoor performance, but I've never felt that brightness was an issue, so it's probably ok. What the iPad lacks in detail more than makes up in size. Laying down in bed with a ten inch screen feels so empowering. I feel like I have all the media in the world in my hands, and I almost do.\n\nApps: I don't use my iPad for work. It stays at home most of the time, and at home, I have my desktop. I would assume it would be pretty easy to use iWork to create, but I wouldn't know. *flame alert* I believe Android is better for smartphones, and iOS for tablets. There is a serious lack of tablet apps for android, but I am continually surprised at the growing iOS tablet app ecosystem. However, there are a greater variety of apps on Android, in my experience. The iPad can actually handle games pretty well, despite its age. That all I really need to say. There isn't any calculator or weather or stocks app, but you'll find great alternatives in the App Store.\n\nCamera: Why are you reading this? What are you doing with your life? Why would you want to use the iPad's camera for anything except FaceTime? Seriously? Well, that's all you're going to be able to do, because the cameras on the 2 are terrible. Really. I would expect more for 500 bucks, but whatever. It's not a priority. If you ever find yourself in so dire a situation that you need to use the iPad camera, you better invest in a disposable, or something.\n\nBattery life: Ho ho. Tee hee. The battery life of the 2 makes me want to giggle. Even 2 years later, the battery life still feels virtually infinite. I can almost guarantee you, you will never have a problem with the iPads battery life. This is because if the square cube principle. The surface area (screen size) increases at rate of the dimensions, squared. The volume, cubed. More volume means more battery. So, theoretically, the bigger the device, the longer the battery life. Oh, and iOS is super efficient, almost forgot that.\n\nPerformance: Welp, iOS7 is here. Anybody with anything older than 2012 must upgrade to escape the lag! Not so. Though the animations in iOS7 are super slow and can induce \"motion sickness\", the iPad 2 handles it pretty well. (I swear, auto correct has something against the word we'll.) The gaming isn't bad for such an old device, though I have yet to try out newer games like asphalt 8. However, you'll be able to stream video (not in hd, of course!) and play 2d games  with no hitches. The keyboard does sometimes take a while to pop up and apps do take somewhat longer to load, but hey, we're talking about an old geezer tablet here.\n\nFeatures: I haven't been able to use Bluetooth to transfer files yet, presumably because Apple wants me to upgrade and use AirDrop. Classic Apple. And I'm pretty sure Siri could easily run on the 2. Oh well, looks like we're stuck with... The two doesn't have any gimmicks, per se, to it. It has the dual cameras, but that's about it. There is nothing to show off. Just to experience. FaceTime is great, though. Like, wow. It's really the best video chat technology I've ever seen. If nothing else, I would commend apple on its FaceTime infrastructure. It's simple and fun and convenient, not to mention powerful.\n\nOverall: Even after 2 years of not so nice treatment, my 2 is functionally perfect. It really feels amazing to be able to consume content on such a big screen. The thinness and lightness of the device make it disappear as you're using it. FaceTime really is the best interpersonal video chat platform as of today. IOS 7 runs fine on this, but don't expect to be so lucky next year. I was actually shocked to see the price here on Amazon. Really? 400 bucks for a 2011 tablet? When the 5 is just around the corner and will cost only 100 more? Only a fool would buy it now. However, the 2 really bolstered the image of Apple I had. I have a first gen Nano that actually still works for a whole day! I would expect the iPad to do the same. This review isn't recommending that you buy the 2. All I'm saying is that Apple makes the best tablets out there. Even the most hardcore Android fanatic (which I am dangerously close to) could agree on some levels. iPads are feat for consuming content. Maybe even for creating. However, if you want to get real work done, you're going to want to wait for the next generation of windows 8 pro tablets with Broadwell Chips in them. I need an IDE to be able to do programming when I go to college, and the fact that no such software is available for iOS means that I can't take this there. The iPad isn't a complete replacement for a real computer. But it comes pretty darn close.\n\nSent from my iPad"}

He has been very proficient at using ipad from a very early age. itunes store has a huge selection of learning apps for his age group and younger. My son has been a ipad and ipod user sinc he was about 9 months old, he thinks he is playing, but he is really learning. He is way ahead of where he should be and he has had a ton of fun doing it. After ios 6&7 came out his ipad 1  was no longer able to keep up with the technology of the upgraded apps. I purchased the 64g ipad 2 so he would have plenty of room for his apps since some of the apps can be large downloads. i am able to also to limit what he is able to do in settings and the app store. He can only get apps ifi unlock it. ipad 2 was easy to child lock certain features and content. ipad 2's long battery is great on trips, it keeps him busy and i don't need active wifi for his apps to work. I wish that ipad existed with my other children. I like that he is learning on current to future technology that most daycares or preschools can not provide.  I recommend this to any parent. The ecpense is worth it. A childs education id priceless. ipad 2 is perfect for facilitating that.\nTJ"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "My wife bought a supposedly new iPad 2 via Amazon which was supplied by the iPad Shop.  When I tried to register it Apple said it was out of warranty.  Long story short, this iPad ended up being a replacement for another unit sold by he iPad Shop back in 2011.  They received a replacement from Apple and sold it to my wife as new in September 2013.  While it might have been new it was recorded by Apple as a replacement to the original owner and thus received the warranty only at the time of return -- which by 2013 had long since expired.  Further, the serial number on the box did not match the serial number on the iPad.  After a back and forth with Apple customer service I finally ascertained that this was a replacement iPad intended for someone else and sold as new by the iPad Shop.  Apple's serial number tracking confirmed this.  It might have been a new unit but Apple changes the serial number on units they replace and would not warranty it beyond the \"original purchase date\".  Bottom line:  Go directly to Apple for their equipment.  That said, I'm not real pleased with Apple for failing to warranty an obviously new unit just because they assigned a new serial number to a customer who never received it.  I returned the iPad and bought another directly from Apple -- I'm not sure why.  Basically, I'm not pleased with either Apple or the iPad Shop.  But I am pleased with Amazon who noted that there have been similar complaints from this vendor and quickly refunded the purchase price.  Just beware of the iPad Shop."}

The people where I purchased the iPad are top notch, and I would recommend this seller to everyone, they really work with you as a consumer, and attempt to solve most challenges. Apple has the operating instructions on the Apple.com site, but they should include the instructions in writing for quick reference. That is not the fault of the seller I might add."}

You can't swap the battery, there's no way to expand the memory (it doesn't have a CF slot or accept a USB stick), and there's no resident filing system included in the OS. Still, the iPad has become the industry standard in aviation, the only platform approved by the FAA as an electronic flight bag.  And, replacing 30 pounds of paper charts (which have to be updated every 56 days) with a 1 1/2 pound tablet saves money, trees, and fuel. So, it's a no-brainer.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have resisted getting a tablet for years. As others have observed, a computer without a real keyboard is weighted toward content consumption rather than content creation (otherwise known as work). To fill the need for a lightweight, long battery life, zero fan/vent portable, I had purchased a Chromeook. Frankly, after the novelty wore off, it was sitting in the drawer more than on my lap.\n\nWell a month or so ago, on a whim I got the iPad 2. Within 24 hours of playing with it and discovering both powerful productivity (like aTimelogger and DayOne) and music apps (such as Synthesia, Garage Band) that fill voids in what I've seen as an owner of an Android phone, I became a devoted member of the iPad cult. From there, I tested several keyboards and have settled on the Kensington Ultimate and Logic Fabricskin.\n\nNow, after month downrange, it smile on my face hasn't worn off -- the iPad and I are inseparable. It is really an integral part of my life and work.\n\nI will probably sell the Chromebook on eBay. This will be the first of many iPads to come as they come out with newer versions."}

I bought it for college, and so far I can do everything from read textbooks to take notes to stay in touch with my family, all on one device.  I know there are a lot of arguments about Android vs. iOS.  Personally, I prefer iOS because it is a very simple interface and I don't need a lot of customization.  If you like to change every single aspect from the background to the icons, etc, then you might prefer a different OS.  But for me, this is perfect."}

I did so correctly, but it was quickly denied with a recommendation that I set up the iPad up using iTunes, another piece of Apple related software. If you don't have access to a computer-- tough luck! I downloaded ITunes onto my computer, connected the iPad, and low and behold, this time it accepted my Wi-Fi password. Could it be that I was manipulated to get iTunes loaded onto my computer? And while I was about it I had to uncheck opportunities to download other Apple software that I don't want.  Anyway, the iPad screen device lit up, finally! If the iPad had eyes it would have seen my scowling face, but I pressed on and eventually set up my e-mail account. The clock on the iPad face was wrong so I tried to change it. That should be easy right? Wrong! Internal clocks gave correct time for all over the world, but the clock on the icon was wrong. Hmm, I thought I'd better look at the manual, which of course is not included with the product. However, the tiny info card that comes with the iPad says it's available on the Apple web site. Ah, ha! I found it. But it wants to know what software is in my iPad. If there's an easy way to determine that, it escapes me. I suppose it's in the manual but if you don't know what manual to look for, you have the perfect catch 22. Anyway I made a guess and looked at the manual. There are 137 pages. At this point I decided the iPad is not user friendly and I'll return it . . . as soon as I've found out how to remove my e-mail password now stored somewhere within the iPad type 2 with software type ????"}

The speaker is on the rear of the ipad (why?!) making the poor audio quality and volume even worse. I have sensitive eyes and the brightness does not go nearly low enough to use comfortably in a dark room at night. The volume buttons don't adjust to when the ipad is rotated so I am constantly changing it in the wrong direction. The web access is dodgy even though my router is in my room and there's no signal issue. iOS is very lacking, notifications are tedious to turn off, ad block doesn't do bleep...\n\nBattery life is pretty much the only thing decent about this. Screen resolution is just OK. I honestly think this is worth about $50-100 at most. $400 can buy a much more versatile and powerful netbook."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I purchased the white iPad 2 + WiFi/3G from my local Apple Store in March of 2011 upon it's release.  At the time, I really felt like I was \"biting the bullet.\"  I guess I just didn't think I would totally harness it's capabilities and only use it \"casually\" to write the occasional e-mail and surf the web.  To that end, I was right but as far as iPad generations are concerned, this device hits the sweet spot for what I use the tablet for (surfing the web, typing posts on Amazon, Tweeting and the occasional e-mail).  It's not too powerful for gaming per se but offers a silky smooth performance for business related functionality.  I even find that I don't need a BlueTooth keyboard as typing on it's screen in landscape mode is fast and easy enough.\n\nThe only disappointment I have is that I paid for the cellular antenna.  I find that I mostly use this device in the home as a quick means of accessing the Internet where a WiFi access point is readily available.  I also take it with me out-of-town and for the most part, most hotels offer free WiFi so the cellular aspect of this device was money wasted.\n\nI am EXTREMELY pleased with this device's battery life.  It has been tested and found that the iPad 2 has the longest battery life of ALL the iPad generations up through the iPad 4 or \"iPad with Retina Display!\"  I truly believe this iPad second generation is the \"sweet spot\" in Apple's iPad lineup and that is why the Cupertino company is continuing to offer this device for purchase.  You don't really need the \"retina\" screen or the extra 500mb of memory for business tasks such as surfing the web or writing an e-mail.  This device will work flawlessly for those tasks.\n\nI can only express how happy I am that I purchased this tablet.  I will probably upgrade to the next iPad 5th generation, if it offers the robust WiFi AC and comes in an even slimmer, more elegant form factor.  I would recommend that users opt out of getting the cellular model unless they need to use the device in their cars for example.  I have a Garmin GPS, so this is a non issue."}

(Warning to owners of iPads, be careful of Apples new 6.x update as it does not help like it should) Otherwise I am very happy with the tablet and am having great time learning how to run it."}

After more than two years of heavy use both personally and professionally I can say the Apple iPad changed my life. It is without a doubt one of the most innovative, useful, and powerful products on the market. That was true in April of 2010 when Apple released the first iPad, and it remains true to this day. An unimaginable number of iPad reviews exist online, so I will not restate the specs or the seemingly endless uses and applications. I will simply state that I have never regretted my purchase of my iPad for one second and I have found it to be one of the most versatile, useful, and simple pieces of technology I have ever owned. It's multipurpose functionality cannot be overstated. I cannot speak highly enough of the Apple iPad - and look forward to the day when I can upgrade to the latest model. Even so, my iPad 2 continues to be fully functional, fast, and sturdy. Why wait - BUY APPLE!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I received my iPad 2 and loved it for a few months. Take note that I am severe o.c.d. here, therefore, there is absolutely no way it got wet or dropped or any other sort of freak accident occurred on my part to hurt it, as suggested by every single troubleshooter out there. It started ghostwriting and not responding correctly to where it was being touched... So I checked out my warranty situation and of course, being that it was a present that was bought months previous to my taking ownership of it (via a belated birthday gift) but never taken out of the box, not that that matters to Apple, I was told I would have to pay full price to replace the touch sensor which I found out recently is such a serious problem with Apple that they (if they cared about their consumers, that is) should have recalled it long ago.. I am already tired of talking about this. I am just getting angry about it again...\n\nI had the same sort of problem when I received an iPod shuffle for an Xmas gift years before.... The people I know with Apple computers can rarely read discs I send them and the friends I have with iPhones have all switched back to droid types...\n\nI do not know why this brand is so popular but I will never buy from them. And I would like to take this opportunity to thank Apple for ruining a few gifts for me. Some really good hearted people spent a lot of their hard earned money to buy me thoughtful gifts which, thanks to your lack of consumer courtesy and a tendency to charge way too much for inferior products, turned out to be complete flops.\n\nAs an extra added insult (to me, not you)... I am writing this on my friend's iPad 2 (the same as mine, that he bought about the same time as mine) He beats this thing mercilessly, gets it wet, steps on it, drops it, lets his toddler do horrible toddler things to it EVERY SINGLE DAY and guess what? This sticky disgusting thing never misses a beat for him.\n\nGo ahead and laugh."}

The price was amazing but I got skeptical after reading some of the seller's reviews.  I wrote the seller myself and was reassured of the product.  It came in 2 days, was well wrapped, it was called Very Good condition- a few scratches on the back, but basically perfect.  It came with an older cover ($40.00 is what it said, but definatley not worth that today, but hey it's a cover), 2 charge cords, clean and working perfectly.  I just ran up to TJ Max to get a new cover- and it really looks like a brand new IPAd for about half the price!  I know I got a very good deal and was happy to have the seller write back immediately for all my concerns, making sure that I was pleased with the product. Don't know what happened to others, but I am very pleased with this product and the responses of the seller.  This was a great deal and I am enjoying every second of my \"new\" ipad for a great price.  Just get the seller's  email and ask questions if you have them- I feel they were very helpful  and concerned.  Even though this was cheap , it is still a major purchase for me and I feel that this purchase was made in confidence and carried through exceeding my expections.  Thanks IPAD MANIA!"}

But if you're considering ordering an ipad from armelectronics2011, THINK AGAIN. When I bought my first ipad 2, the listing was for a brand new still in box product. When I received it, the ipad was NOT in its original box (as I anticipated) and after a couple of months, I started to realize that the ipad 2 that I had purchased from armelectronics2011 was complete CRAP. I'm pretty sure that the screen on the ipad I had bought was actually replaced in a very unprofessional way and in time, it showed because the white ipad began to turn yellow. The home button did not work correctly, the glass began to peel away from the actual ipad, and the entire ipad began to act as if it had a virus (which apple products supposedly do not get viruses). When I contacted the seller about their false advertising for their \"brand new product\" it took two days of phone tag to even contact them, and even when I FINALLY talked to them, they basically told me \"oh well, not our fault, you can pay the return shipping and a restocking fee to get your money back\" -which by the way is not at all worth the trouble after all of their unnecessary fees for something that was THEIR FAULT. I in the end kept the ipad 2 from this seller (REGRETFULLY) and eventually bought a new one.\nBasically, if you want to splurge for an ipad of any sort, go for it because in my opinion it is worth it. But if you're planning to purchase from this seller, PLEASE don't. Really. Do not get ripped off in the way I did. You are truly better off buying an ipad(any generation) for the full value."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "(Caveat: I'm not a techie dude (though I do enjoy some techno music... go figure, right?) so proceed cautiously with my review...)\n\nI've been brought to the iPad dragging my heels, kicking and screaming, like a bratty toddler told to eat his peas (I hate peas).\n\nMy history: I've not been a fan of the proprietary and I love music.  Some years ago, before my kids bought an iPod... I owned a Creative Zen Vision M MP3 player... 60 gigs that thing carried... and I could download whatever I wanted into it... no proprietary poo and nobody needed to know my financial information or address, and I loved that lil device for that freedom.  Creative created a great product, and in fact they own a couple of patents that enable certain Apple products to work, but like Beta recording tape... a technology that was superior to VHS, yet it was popularity of the lessor product that eventually killed the chances of the better device ever really taking hold.  Similarly, from a freedom point of view.. seems like much of the MP3 market has gone the way of the dinosaur, losing out to the proprietary Apple name.  And so begins my review.\n\nTo recap: I hate proprietary.  And Apple IS that: proprietary.  Having said this, and yielding to my better senses, I have made allowance to bend towards the Apple by initially purchasing my iPhone.  I still hate the proprietary... love the device; Apple, begrudgingly liked by me for the things they build, made such a great device in the iPhone that I decided to take the leap by swallowing the whole schtick and bought this iPad.\n\nThis second generation, 16 gig, iPad purchase was a big one for our family... actually, for my wife (as a birthday present to her), and she's been tethered to it for two days... loves it.\n\nIt's a nice sized tablet... much easier to surf the internet with a larger screen than that of an iPhone, so that's a nice plus.  As for their proprietary... if you move to Apple with the purchase of your own iPad, you'll have to give them information... personal information, to include credit card, and normally that's enough to stop me in my tracks, so if you're like me and don't easily want to part with giving this info out... this isn't the tablet for you.  But before you consider not buying this tablet for that reason, remember that once you do give in, you're introduced to a world of great products and support.\n\nAs far as functionability... this iPad is basically a picture/video taking wi-fi accessing internet surfing tool (nice run-on).  Conceptually, the tablet is intuitive in it's function... if you already own an iPod/iPhone/iPad.... yet if you don't, navigation/use of this tablet is pretty easy to learn... easier still if you have someone that owns one helping you for the first 2 mins.\n\nWhat makes this device interesting is the ability to add applications (apps) that enable you to do a millions things with this device.  Some apps are free while some cost money... and they're found once you hit the \"App Store\" icon on your device.\n\nMy iPad was purchased with the wi-fi connectibility option only; I wasn't interested in purchasing (another...) 3g AT&T smart device usage fee, though it's an option (another model...).  As for internet connectibility, I just have to find a wi-fi site and wahla... connection, at no extra cost to me.  Sure, this doesn't make the tablet very usable while in motion, but that's not a big deal for my usage intent... so this really doesn't effect me as it would someone who's occupation relies on such mobility usage (did that make sense?  Hope so...).\n\nThis tablet comes with 16 gigs of memory (same as my phone...); I have hundreds of photos and some video on my phone, but no music.  If you have an ample music collection you would like to carry/keep on this iPad, I might suggest you purchase one with a higher storage capability.  This iPad will be used by my wife and she's going to stick pictures on it, perhaps SOME music, but not much between the two; for her, 16 gigs is just right.\n\nAs for other functions: it's got a camera (don't ask me for specs... look them up.  New generation iPads have newer iris'/greater photo capabilities), that can also take video.  I can do a video type conferencing with another Apple device (another iPhone/iPad, for example)... it's called \"facetime\"... that's a neat feature that my 4 year old loves when I'm at work for two days or more at a time.  Battery life seems good... charging is a snap; USB or wall... you can do both with hardware supplied.\n\nImportantly, and to their credit... Apple does a great job supporting their products (my experience with a problematic iPhone, handled by Apple Care... was top-notch).  They take care of warrantied items very well.  An additional note: Apple stores, if you 've got one close-by... are a great resource for handling warranty/problematic software issues... so the support for the product, in-store or not, is there.\n\nAs for iPads or tablets in general... there are others, but even this second generation iPad makes internet connection, and use, a breeze.  After owning now... two devices, I'm a believer in the products that Apple (thus far...) have made... and though I STILL don't dig the proprietary thing, it's a reasonable trade-off for being able to use a pretty great device.\n\nI hope this review assists you in making your choice, whichever that choice may be.  Thanks for listening."}

I test out tablets/ e-readers because I need them for school/coursework however The Apple Ipad has poor buisness apps and tools. The notes apps are very basic and less focused on. Apple mainly foucuses on its apps and games which attract the younger population. For example it has more Angry Birds Apps then your fingers on your hand! Some strong points are the Facebook app, Facetime(Similar to Skype) and Itunes. Not my taste of tablet and I will be selling it soon."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have had an iPad2 for roughly a year.  In that time, I have had to take it in for repairs twice.  The first time was when it was upgrading the OS software and simply stopped halfway through the process.  I plugged it in since I did not want it to die from lack of battery power.  Three days later, it was still at the same place in the download.  That was the first trip to the repair shop.  A week or two later, it is back and working great.  Now, about a month ago, it was at about 60% power so I plugged it in for the night.  That was the last I saw any life in the thing.  Since I do not have the receipt (it was a gift) and too much time has passed (even though much of the time was not necessarily in my possession), repairs are going to cost a bucket load.  The while that I had the iPad2 was pretty fun, but Heaven knows when I will see it again, and I believe that the information recorded on it will be gone.  So, short story, my experience is a two-star experience with Apple."}

After some thought, I decided to get an iPad 2, since the mini and this one were built the same.  I am not disappointed.  As soon as I added the upgrade, I was able to use Siri, even on the iPad 2.  I personally can't tell the difference between Retina display or not, so, I am pleased with this purchase.  You can't go wrong."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "When I bought my iPad, it was a complete splurge. I was at the apple store to fix a operator-error with my iphone and asked about the iPad. I originally thought that it was just an overgrown iPod touch, but the more I learned about it, the more I realized that it seemed to be a small computer. The iPad has Bluetooth capabilities and I bought a Bluetooth keyboard to go with the iPad. I am still wrapping my head around the iPad and all its features. I really enjoy the iCloud, allowing me to sync up my iPhone and iPad. One of the first apps I downloaded was Pages and it has been fantastic. One of my biggest concerns regarding the iPad is the accessibility to remove documents, pictures,etc off of the iPad. There is no USB port, so I cannot hook up a zip-drive and due to the age of my Mac, I cannot download the iCloud app. So my only options are to email it to myself or go on my computer, go to the iCloud website, sign-on and get the document that way. When I brought this up to the Apple worker, he stated that the iPad is capable of printing directly from the iPad as an option as well. So that minimized my concerns. Over all, I am very happy with the decision I made, all my questions regarding the iPad have been able to be answered with a simple google-search. One of the best spur-of-the-moment purchases I have ever made."}

I found the dint on the bottom side and just hope that does not affect the iPad, so far so good. I also wish that I was told about all the scratches on the back, this is ok because I bought a case to cover it but I think when you spend a lot of money on something even if its used that the buyer should be notified of all the flaws before hand. I thought I would be able to  download Microsoft Office and I can not so I had to download a app and pay $10 so I can do my school work on it which is the main purpose I bought it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "My primary reason for acquiring an iPad was for leisure and for work in the future.  I am currently a college student with plans to teach at the high school level, so I knew there would be endless amount of apps that will enhance my teaching in the future.  Right now, schools are exploring 1 on 1 iPads with their students because it makes it so much easier to grade and create assignments without the hassle of textbooks.  At home, I became sick of pulling out my four-year old Dell laptop to surf the web, watch videos, and just play around.  I wanted something that was smaller, easy to travel with, and it had to be a tablet.  Now, my Dell is fine for writing papers and all the other obligations that come with being a college student, but for an apple product as efficient and productive as the iPad, the price is tough to beat.  The iPad does not replace a desktop or a laptop, but it is a tremendous technological device that is user friendly and fun to play with.  Whether it is for leisure or work, there is an application for it.  What I like the most is that the ios apple system signals to the iPad when it is time for an update, making it up to par with the latest technology, which in turn betters its efficiency and productivity instantly.  With that being said, the ability to access the apple store is what sets it apart from other tablets.  Like I previously stated, there are apps for everything, and there are even several free apps that increase enjoyment and productivity.  It is a must buy for anyone interested in a tablet for both leisure and work obligations.\n\nI also have an iPhone 4 which I use very religiously, and the iPad 2 is an extension of that for me.  There are fewer apps available for the iPad, but that's not saying a lot, as there are still thousands available for it, as I find myself searching for a new app daily on the apple store.\n\nI have the 32GB edition and have not come close to filling up all the storage space!  I think it is the perfect size for somebody that doesn't constantly use it, but for someone that is on it daily at work or at home.  If you are going to count on it for everything you do in regards to a computer device, I would recommend the 64GB, but for me the 32GB has been great and I have not run into any problems to this point.  In addition, the device is very light, and you can hold it with one hand.  Definitely buy a protective case for your iPad, even though I have found it to be very durable.\n\nIt is very nice to be able to use it like a mini computer.  You can access your personal files via google drive, drop box, etc. to increase productivity and bring your desktop or laptop files on the road with you.  One nice feature is that you can view websites with a mobile display or desktop display, serving for the benefit of all users.  Powerpoints, Word Documents, and PDF's are easy to view with the tap of the finger, which is very beneficial for someone in the business world or still in school.\n\nWhile I thoroughly enjoy my iPad 2, there are frustrations with it.  I find myself frustrated with the fact that I can't play Flash.  I like to watch videos, especially via twitter and facebook, and a lot of times I am unable to do so because of the software's inability to play flash.  In addition, I get frustrated because I wish I could make the iPad my only source of a computer.  I wish I could type on word and make a powerpoint as seamless as I do on my Dell.  I could do that, but on a college budget you don't want to be paying for an expensive app to make that a reality, but that's also the beauty of it.  You could download Microsoft Office products if you wanted to make it your go-to computer device.  One thing I would suggest is buying a keyboard for your iPad.  I went a year without one, but once I acquired a keyboard it made it that much more efficient to use!  So much easier to surf the web, iMessage, etc.\n\nIn essence, if you're having a tough time deciding on buying an iPad or not, I would highly suggest buying one.  Now, if it is between a MAC laptop and an iPad, go with the laptop.  But, if you are in the market for a tablet and are looking for efficiency and productivity with a tablet, the iPad is a much because of the apple IOS software and the thousands of applications available via the apple store.  The slick design with endless amount of possibilities to increase production with an iPad puts it a head above the rest.  Once you begin using an iPad, you won't regret the purchase."}

I told him the only thing I wanted was the IPad with wireless AND 3G. Of course he thought I was nuts since I had a perfectly good, working IPAd already. So naturally, I got my wish!  We ordered a refurbished one to save money. I have not been disappointed yet! I take it everywhere with me. I am impressed with the speed even when using 3G.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I swore up and down I'd NEVER purchase an apple product, including things on itunes and the like.  So far, I have upheld that promise.  However, from a recent car purchase, I managed to obtain an iPad 2 16GB as a promotion.  Since my girlfriend had one and I did want some experience with iOS, I figured I'd begin poking around with it rather than simply selling it.\n\nThe good...\n\niOS is very easy to use and extremely straight forward.  Everything is laid out nicely and always a flick-tap away.  And most all programs work very well with the unit.  Software tends to be clean without too many bugs.\n\nWeb browsing (just using Safari) is very smooth.  Most sites work well.  There's the ocational hiccup but it's more from using a touchscreen or the dreaded lack of Flash.  But soon enough, sites will probably migrate away from flash and on towards HTML5 (or simply pages designed for mobile/iPads).\n\nUsability, such as typing is very straight forward.  The keyboard is well thought out and works much better than any I've used.  The touchscreen is very responsive too and multi-touch works without a problem.\n\nStandby time is awesome and the unit is still functioning (IE gives you push notifications of Skype/AIM/etc)\n\nGiven the standpoint of say someone's who's very unfamiliar with technology or who doesn't care to spend time \"configuring things\", this works great.  However, that is not who I am...\n\nThe bad...\n\nYou are extremely limited.  Being closed source, some apps simply are not available as they would be for Android or Windows-based tablets (and I mean x86, not Windows 8 RT)  Finding ways to print can be impossible, certain formats may be unreadable, and even simple things such as adding attachments in gmail may be hindered without installing additional apps.\n\nNo Flash support!!!  As mentioned above, things are moving away from flash.  However, many sites still use flash there for some sites will not display correctly.  You are also limited on sites like Youtube, sometimes being unable to open the same videos you can open on a desktop environment (or even Android devices).\n\nWhere are my files?!  Stuff just downloads.  You have no choice where to put them.  Download something you don't want to share then start browsing the photos you took using the camera, SURPRISE!\n\nLimited connectivity.  Expansion is limited to the propriatary apple plug on the bottom.  No OTG port, no standard USB, no microSD slot, no HDMI.  You can purchase some overpriced devices to give you these functions, but it would be nice to see some of them included.\n\n---\n\nAll in all, it depends on the person whether or not one of these would fit your bill.  My girlfriend loves hers and almost never uses her PCs anymore.  For me, I'll grab mine for basic web surfing and the like, but if I'm doing much typing or any surfing that requires a fair bit of clicking, I still will grab a laptop over this."}

It is very user friendly, it has tons of apps, and they are all ran through Apple so they work very well. There are occasional crashes with streaming app, but it only closes the app and you can reopen it. This is the iPad 2, so, if you are expecting Siri... you will be disappointed. Siri is nice, but it isn't needed to love this product. The maps is still awful, but you can get Google maps and that is much better. Realistically, this is wonderful for people who do a lot of internet based surfing and want a phone experience but bigger. It is also great for family that is horrible with tech. If you are wondering, \"Well, I'm a power user, is there anything for me?\" Firstly, you should know how to look that up yourself. Secondly, yes! You can VPN into a laptop or desktop with many apps available in the app store to Virtualize your desktop from any wifi access point.

There were a few things about it that I didn't like but they really didn't matter to me (ex: camera, keyboard, etc). But the main problem I had was the limitations. For instance say someone wants to play a facebook game or something similar, cannot play it. You can play games found on the AppStore, but not your favorite online game. All in all it is a decent table, I don't recommend this for people wanting something as their main computer, this computer has too many limitations.

I have completed a Teaching Certificate, Liberal Arts Certificate, and about to complete my Liberal Arts Diploma by April 2013. My iPad has been with me since day one, I use it everyday for research, readings, logging on to my schools system, and also typing up documents on Pages, and creating presentations on Keynote. I usually charge once a night, and that one charge lasts for hours. Its such a great device, very useful and helps lessen the load I carry around. Without it I would be hauling around a binder full of paper. In fact, I'm writing this review on my iPad.

Well, that is until I actually picked one up and used it. After spending a whole day driving and searching through three towns for an available unit at any store,my gf and I finally found one ( iPad 1). Long story short it ended up spending the first week with me ( I know I'm awful) as I enjoyed hbo streaming through the xfinity app. When the iPad 1 couldn't cut it anymore I turned to the iPad 2 and I am more then satisfied even after the new hi res iPad came out. I love my 2 and prefer to surf the web and watch movies on this thing over my laptop. Amazon you're the best!"}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I wanted to know what I was missing and apparently it was my money.\n\nYou're dependent on iTunes and it's junk. Apple products are said to be easy to use but they don't live up to the hype. iTunes expects the user to know what to do. There are no clues as to how it should be used. All of that money and they can't even afford tool tips. I've spend an hour trying to figure out how to put a PDF into my iPad and it's like pulling teeth. A simple task made difficult by a bad design. Why can't I just drag and drop the files using Windows explorer like every other hardware product in the world? Why so difficult?\n\nApple had an edge when they were first to market. Now they're relying on the loyal base and offer no advantages. Pay more and do less. Still no USB or SD card slots? It makes every task difficult.\n\nGood for browsing the web and checking email but not much more.\n\nI had to try it and regret the purchase.\n\nSimple tasks could be A LOT easier.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter wasting another hour of my life I finally figured out how to put PDFs onto this piece of junk. When I first started iTunes there was only one menu available and it was hidden under a graphic in the upper left corner of the app. I \"Added files to library\" from the menu and selected my PDFs. This made them appear in iTunes under Books but it didn't put them on my iPad even after several syncs and prayer.\n\nThe solution(of course) was to select Show Menu Bar from the first menu to get a second menu (File, Edit, View, ...), then I could select View Side Bar to get a third menu I needed to add my PDFs. The first screen they appeared in was also labeled Books but it is obviously something different. After doing a sync the PDFs didn't appear in the Acrobat Reader where I expected them(why would they?) and I eventually found them in iBooks.\n\nThe PDFs still won't appear in either of the PDF apps I installed.  Why not? This makes absolutely no sense. Easy? No.\n\nI tried using the iPad search feature but it can't find the PDFs that are on the iPad even though they show up in iBooks. The files are there. Why doesn't search find them? Because iPads are over priced JUNK! Basic functionality doesn't work.\n\nApple products are supposed to be easy to use but they are far from it.\n\nVery disappointed.  Not designed well and lots of room for improvement. It makes me wonder what they've been working on for the last few years. It wasn't usability.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe more i use it, the more I hate it.  This weekend I received a message from iCloud Backup that has rendered my iPad completely useless.  When I tap OK to dismiss the message it keeps coming back. I can't dismiss the message, I can't interact with any apps, I can't power it down, I can't pull the battery. What am I supposed to do? Is this why everybody goes to the Apple store?"}

I have not tried to transfer video directly from my video camera but I plan to see if that is possible. Glad I bought the 64GB model.\nI have an i-Pod Touch for when I need a very portable  small, pocket size  lightweight device. However the battery life on the Touch is short compared th the i-Pad2. Of course one must have a laptop/desktop/printer for the heavier tasks. And now I have the i-Pad2 for medium size tasks with medium portability, increased functionality and plenty of pure digital fun/toy possibilities.  The operating system on this device is tried and true and by now has been tested over time. The screen and visuals are quite acceptable to these eyes. If you need more in terms of visuals then you may require one of the newer models. Otherwise the 'improvements' in the generations following the i-Pad2 are mostly cosmetic in this users humble opinion.\nI save 5 stars for perfection. This device falls only slightly short of that.\nHighly reccommended."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "First, I am tech savvy. I mainly use a PC. I have owned an iphone before. Don't use macs. This is my first ipad. It was given to me as a gift. I use android based phones.\n\nMy impression is that the ipad is very much like the iphone. Exactly the way you get into the phone you do the ipad. The icons are identical. So if you're coming from those other devices it's nice to have the same icons that you're already familiar with.\n\nOverall I'm happy with the unit. My only real complaints are the camera, speakers, no siri and lack of microsd card slot. The camera is horrible. I was shocked to learn the mexapixel that comes stock on this device. I don't think it's even 1 megapixel but for taking pictures it's really bad. Very grainy. Video recording is in hd so when the video does come out the picture is good quality. But the camera pictures are horrible.\n\nThe speakers are mono. I'm not sure why they are mono on such a flagship device. They sound ok but i figured you would at least get stereo speakers with something that costs over $400.\n\nLack of microsd slot. Now this is really bad. iphones don't have them either. neither do their ipods. it's a great way for apple to make more money since you can't upgrade the storage capacity. Android tablets and phones I'm able to add up to 64gb of extra storage. So with this device I'm locked in to what storage I buy. That's apple's deal so take it or leave it.\n\nNo siri. Upgrading to os 6 I thought that I would at least get siri. No. Apple won't allow that. Kinda sad for their once top of the line tablet. Ok but not really a big deal. Just would have been a nice feature.\n\nIf I were in the market for a new tablet now, I would seriously consider the Samsung Note 10.1. It can do everything the new ipad can do and more."}

My Dad who has had an IPad for a while mentioned before that the email app was about impossible for him to use. Now I know it wasn't only because of his eyesight  problem.\nEdit: I've been using the Ipad for some time, now, and no longer have a problem using the email app. Guess I got used to it, and figured out how to do it better."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I really like this iPad. I just couldn't give it 5 stars because the display looks alot less sharp than my iPhone 4S. I know this does not have the retina display, which is why, but it just still irritates me a bit when I use it. If I knew the new iPad would have been out soon, I would have held out on buying this until the new iPad with the retina display was out. Anyway, this iPad is still useful. I use it mostly for reading/writing emails and surfing the web while sitting on the couch. Sometimes I use Facetime which works well since my Wifi connection is fast. This thing runs smoothly and is pretty fast. The games for iPad are pretty fun to play on thing as well. Also, I find the camera is not all that great indoors and most of my indoor photos look grainy. Overall a good product but not the sharpest screen."}

The glass was new and the back was used as per the description.  The back was chipped severely on all sides like it fell from a moving bicycle--it should not have been used.  Under the glass was a dark splotch about 2x4 inches.  Its wasn't subtle--it was a glaring defect.  Once turned on, the splotch selected whatever was underneath it.  Apparently there was not even the breifest of efforts given towards quality control.  The tablet was unusable.  A horrible disapointment."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I will be the first to admit - I am an android lover (it is such a cute little robot).  More importantly, I am also a techie, so it was inevitable that curiosity would eventually kill the cat (cat being the product loyalty).  When I decided that I wanted to see if iPads live up to the hype, I didn't want to go all out - I wasn't going to purchase a plan from a phone company that will overcharge me for limited data use - especially not when I can tether devices to my phone!  I also wasn't going to pay at least $100 more to get a retina display since I view it as unnecessary for me- certainly not worth the extra money (even if I do have an instinct to have the latest and greatest). I decided that the iPad2 16GB would be appropriate to base my decision!\n\nThe iPad is a good looking piece of hardware - but I would say that the software left me feeling limited in what I was able to do.\n\nPros:\n-It's pretty - I do love a good looking piece of technology, and in that, the iPad does not disappoint\n-I like the multitouch gestures\n\nCons:\n-Heavy if you are reading in bed\n-Edges around the screen mean that I have to stretch my thumbs that much further if I am trying to hold and manipulate the device with both hands (you can always cradle it in one arm and manipulate with the other, but it just feels odd no matter how you do it)\n-No expandable memory - there are very few android tablets that do not offer this- get with the program apple\n-the App Store was not user friendly and was stubborn when connectivity wasn't fast\n-I find the settings app to be all over the place - settings for a single app may be in three different places (wouldn't it be nice to get into an individual app's settings from within that app)\n\nOverall, if you are looking for something simple to use and don't want to be able to do anything too indepth the iPad is a perfectly adequate choice.  iOS is very straight forward, and generally user friendly as long as you don't want to change settings for them (ie you want to use default settings)- otherwise, you may have to go on a hunt for the exact setting you are looking for (if it even exists).  I have no plan to get rid of my iPad - it works in a pinch and if I am doing something that may be hazardous to my technology, I would bring my iPad, but ultimately, I still prefer my android tablets!"}

The controls are simple enough for even my parents to understand (lol, I love them, but they're a little slow on the technological uptake), but the functions it provides and the apps that can be added are able to provide complex operations tailored to suit any need.\n\nThe battery life is amazing. I can use it almost continuously for approximately twenty hours before I need to reuse it. Less if I'm using heavy graphics, etc. But even then it functions for around sixteen hours. It charges very quickly when turned off and plugged into the wall. The screen is very responsive, and the keyboard is not as difficult to use as I had feared (this is referring to the larger keyboard that appears when you turn the device side-ways. The smaller keyboard is more difficult, but not impossible). The only downside I see to the keyboard is that I can't select Spanish letters and accents. I hear that there may be a way to get them, but I haven't had success thus far.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful device. I love it, and would buy it again."}

After borrowing friends Android tablets, I realised the iPad was utter garbage.\n\nReasons:\n-email client constantly freezing up\n-the entire tablet constantly hanging\n-Safari, the worst web browser EVER created\n-lack of truely useful apps that are fully integrated with either Macs or Windows based PC's\n-lack of USB, SD, or any peripheral besides completely proprietary Apple devices\n-iTunes\n-inability to reliably surf 70% of the internet\n-has Bluetooth, but won't connect to non-Apple Bluetooth devices\n-the apps for just straight suck, i.e. YouTube and Apple Maps\n-now that my iPad 1 is over a year old it doesn't even want to turn on about a 4th of the time, so planned obsolesence makes this list\n\nUnless you have money to burn, or just want your kids to have a neat playtoy because the games are at least enjoyable like Cut The Rope, I recommend getting the Samsung tablet.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have the ipad 4 now and I have had all of the other I pads except the first generation. I am a gadget girl who luvs Apple products. Honestly speaking, there is such a small difference between the 2nd and 4th generation ipads its not worth the upgrade. If you wear glasses and/or have trouble with blurriness and stuff then by all means upgrade to the 3, but the 4th generation is not even a noticeable difference.  It does have a faster processor but not Samsung fast, so if given the choice go with the 2nd generation if its a lot cheaper than 3rd generation. If the 2nd and 3rd are close in price go for the 3rd generation.\n\nTo sum it up\n1st generation- good for a kid\n2nd generation- good if you can get it for a lot less than the 3rd generation.\n3rd generation- good for people who can use every bit of clearness in reading/suffer from blurriness, cant find a good deal on a 3rd generation.\n4th generation- if you want normal speed service, its not super fast but it is average which is good.\n\nNow if you are trying to decide between the iPad and the samsung. You cant compare Apples and oranges. apples are apples and oranges are androids. the samsung is much much much faster and allows you to use flash, but in my opinion that is all.  The iPad has several things that are custom to work with iPad and don't function the same on the samsung tablet.  If i couldn't have the iPad I would definitely have the samsung.\n\nThe ipads, all 4 are being sold here for more than it is at the apple store. Amazon used to be my go to place for all apple products but it is a bit ridiculous that a dented,scratched and cracked ipad is being marketed for more than retail or same price as it was when it came out #GMAB maybe the price will come down after Christmas."}

This was my best purchase of the decade. The parental controls are amazing. I have Safari, iTunes, App Store, etc. all disabled. They have about 13 movies, 64 apps (mostly educational apps for letter tracing, coloring, baby Spanish, and so on), 28 books, and even Netflix for the weekends. They learned how to use it VERY QUICKLY! Within a day of showing them how to do stuff no more than once, they've pretty much mastered it. I have an Otterbox Defender case on it because they do abuse it quite a bit. When watching Netflix I hook it up to the TV so they don't have to worry about holding it. When we do leave the house and are away from WIFI they have plenty of content to keep them happy, esp in the car on long trips.\n\nI have an iPhone so I haven't use it for myself yet. If you have PC and are used to Windows 7 you will feel the iPad is extremely limited on what you can do. The onscreen keyboard is very awkward for my small hands when typing because the letters are so spaced out. My WPM drop dramatically on the iPad but pairing it with a Bluetooth keyboard I imagine will fix that problem, except that I've yet to see one that comes close to my Windows Keyboard. However, I just installed Windows 8 on my PC and I hate it so much I am considering selling it and purchasing an iPad for myself.\n\nI'm also saving up to get one for my 67 year old daddy whom calls me weekly asking me how to get the sound and video back working on Skype and how to get back to his FB page on his laptop.

The only temporary resolve is flipping it in and off airplane mode to stop it from freezing up, which I tend to do about 5 times a day . When it works , I love it .. Guess that's all I can say about that ."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have to admit I wish i would of thought of the idea of Ipads years ago and would of banked millions haha\n\nIpad (2) are a necessity  for everyone ranging from a business man, to a college student to a busy mom to a learning child. Ipads have everything you need all in one and what makes this thing so great is that it works for various and different types of people needs.\n\nOk im from the old school days, remember when you had to carry a planner, a calendar, a calculator, a to do list, a grocery list all in your purse and before you know it, your purse had so much weight to it!!\nNow ipads have all of that in one and more!!\n\nTechonologhy has allowed us this generation to be more efficient and less time consumed by having gadgets like this run our busy lives.\n\nNow if you don't have an ipad you may say you don't need an ipad, but I have to say you're wrong! Whether you like to read, watch movies, listen to music, play games, surf the net, do homework, ipad should be apart of your life and will make things so much simpler.\n\nFOR KIDS:\nIpad is a great learning toy, probably the best one made. It something about the huge touch screen filled with color that makes kids go crazy for it, and with all the learning apps it will trick your kid into thinking its a toy, when their learning and playing at the same time. It amazes me how now schools like elem and middle school will now be having ipads for their students. Its great because growing up i remember having tons of books in a big ole jansport the that weighed my back down.\nThere are tons of apps available for kids and if you want your child to learn or sit still at home or in the car get your child an ipad\n\nFOR STUDENTS:\nIf you're in college or even high school having 4 to 8 classes each class requires atleast 2 books and those books add up and are even costly. Ipad 2 can save all that and even save on buying those stocks of notebook paper. ipad 2 allows you to take notes and have all your college books stored on there. Amazing!\n\nFOR BUSY MOMS:\nbeing a mom is a very busy 24 hour job!!! And as a mom you have to keep up with appointments, doc visits for your child, birthdays, and etc. Instead of carrying a planner, calendar, and etc. Having an ipad and apps for your busy mom. schedule makes life a bit more easier.\n\nIpads are great for every age and even grandmas/grandpas. The huge screen allows us readers to zoom in and see everything clearly.\n\nMY EXPERIENCE:\nAt 1st when iPads came out i said i did not NEED one simply becuz Iam always glued to my computer! and than computers wasn't portable easily, i mean yes you can take it with you, but i mean can you slip it right in your purse...no! I never really left home with my laptop because i had to find wi fi and than carry it in its case, bring the plug, it just felt like too much! And than the iPhones came out! I'm like great portability, internet, email check on the go, Facebook, tweet, on the go!!!\nBut as great as the iphones are they are made for that....to be a phone and being on the internet and etc would drain my battery and i need it for calls. but the major drawback for me was the screen, iphone 4s screen seems sooo small compared to an ipad 2\n\nSo one day my husband convinced on an iPad 2 by getting me one, and i was instantly in love!!\n\nas much as I work on my computer at home, once I'm done and i want to relax and read n surf the internet n listen to some music i pull out my iPad 2 and i own a mac. I don't want a laptop on my lap while I'm laying down.\nAnd than the portability!! love it i can slip this in my purse, i don't need to bring a charger, case, and etc, just the iPad and I'm out the door.\nNow ipads shouldn't be computer replacements if you do most work on a computer. Now if you do a lot of homework, word docs, emailing on a iPad i would definitely suggest a keyboard, my hands hurt just typing this review\nI use my ipad for everything from listening to pandora to watching Netflix movies while I'm in the kitchen cooking. Its a great entertainment tool and saves money on electricity instead of having the tv and radio on all the time.\n\nBattery Life:\nWhen i first got the iPad 2 it felt like it took 2 days for it die even with heavy use, now after couple of months I have to charge it atleast once a day. on heavy use, it can last a couple of hours with no charge. So battery life is ok\n\nTouch screen:\nVery responsive touch screen better than other touch screen tablets. You don't have to press hard and it quickly responds to your fingertips!\n\nScreen size:\nI think the screen size is a bit big, but great, I mean you can see everything so clearly and zoom in and everything is right in your face.\n\nWeight:\nI carry this in my purse daily and im not complaining of shoulder pain. It does add a little weight to my purse but nothing where its like omg i have to take this out my bag. In comparison its like having 2 notebooks in your bag/purse\n\nCons:\nUnlike most other tablets they have hdmi ports, sd slots, usb slots ipads have none of those. It would be great if it atleast can take a memory card on its own and not need to buy a accessory to attach to transfer photos.\n\nCamera:\ncamera quality back and front sucks to me. The way phones are made now with 8 mp cameras the ipad 2 is in no comparison its camera quality is like a razor phone, when cameras on phones first came out. Like it does the job but nothing to print out and frame up.\n\nOverall I think apple did a great concept for technology by creating this and making our busy lives less hectic. iPads can be used for everything from music, to youtube, to web surfing, to email, to word docs, to reading, and so much more. If you're undecided to get an ipad, consider it. I don't think you'll regret like return it back, you ll be too in love. It is a bit pricy but than again all apple products are, and honestly coming from windows for over 12years straight and android phones for over 10 years straight i only regret not going to apple sooner.\n\nIts like having a nissan car 1st and driving a bentley after, you'll never want to go back to a nissan\n\nI love my Ipad 2, im using it now for this review and i use it every single day! happy shopping!"}

I live in a very rural area and internet service is 80-90$ a month and extremely slow. So I had an idea \"hey, what if I use the 3G on an iPad as a supplement to wifi in my area. Turns out Verizon works great in my area and it is only 30$ a month with NO CONTRACT. I had no idea you could get 3G without a contract, for me that really sealed the deal. Now I am using Internet that is actually FASTER then wifi in my area!  Since in am savings 50-60$ a month, the savings will pay for the device in 10months and end up saving me hundreds upon hundreds of dollars. I love it!\n\nThe Internet is surprisingly easy to navigate and the touch keyboard is much easier to use then I thought it would be. If you are in an area where Internet is pricy and all you really do is surf the web, consider getting an iPad as an Internet device. I am pretty sure you can tether it to a laptop anyways and use Internet.\n\nFor me, the iPad is an important, practical and HUGE money saving device !!!"}

The iPad 2 is so much faster and does not loose the browsers like the Acer did. The only one era back on the iPad is it seems to me that a lot of the apps that re suppose to be free are very limited and require you to purchase something to go further in the game or to play it more than twice a day. When I used the Acer they had lot more free apps than apple does and for the most part when they are free they are not limited. I gave the Acer to my son he has lot more games to play on it than I do. Over all I love the Ipad2 mostly for its speed."}

The iPad 2 doesn't heat up.  The iPad 3 does.  The iPad 2 is a bit thinner and lighter (not much but notable).  Contrary to what I'd expected, the 2540x1480 screen is almost useless.  You still browse the web at only 720x1280, and most other commonly-used tasks.  Only a handful of games are made for 2540 resolution; therefore, it's practically useless given the iPad 2 is nearly half the price of the 3rd and 4th generation (which are both too similar to distinguish). While the A4/A5/A6 processors differ, it doesn't translate into real life differences in overall performance for watching videos, mail, web browsing, etc.  IMO the iPad 2 is s till the best tablet to come out in the past 3 years given that it's about half the price as those of its successors."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "This is my 2nd Apple product I've ever owned.  The first one being the littlest Ipod from years ago.  I'm pretty impressed by it, along with my lil daughter, when she saw it being charged, she screamed \"Ipad!!!\"  lol.  The only thing that bummed me out was when it came with no battery life at all.  I had to charge it while getting the Ipad2 all set up, needless to say, it was stuck to the charger for couple of hours, while I downloaded free apps. I did notice it immediately registered Verizon, but I have AT&T wireless internet at home and this was meant to be just Wifi only.  And not for long, it started asking if I want to add more data now or later before I can proceed with browsing.  That was an easy fix and I was able to modify it to just Wifi only. It then asked for IOS6 update while in the midst of downloading apps.  And after that, it was just smooth sailing and I made sure to enable some restrictions so my 4 yr old won't be buying any in-apps accidentally.  Read too much horror stories on that.  I did tell her to never click on the word \"buy\" because that would mean, it will take money away from Mommy!  LOL  Overall, quite happy with my big purchase.  I know this ain't the newest Ipad model but to me, it's good enough!\nAnd I am as pleased with the case and the screen protector I bought here in Amazon.\nUPDATE: 4/22/2015\nI am so disappointed to share that our beloved Ipad died after 2 yrs and 4  months.  It was all great until around the time when it upgraded to the latest IOS and it seemed to deteriorate from there, it still worked as normal, just a few glitches here and there and so I downgraded to the previous IOS version which seemed better.  But just one day, my daughter reached for our Ipad and then it just went black for no reason, no warnings, whatsoever.  And then I tried so many times to \"restore/update\" and just won't go beyond the restoring firmware.  I got the Apply Genius people look at it and the guy said, it's just time to upgrade as these are meant to be upgraded every 2 yrs or so (I'm shocked!), especially after paying for more than $500 new, they can replace it with $249.  So now, I'm contemplating on just buying a Samsung Tab 4, and can only hope that it will last longer than this Ipad."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Hardware:\nThe design of the iPad is exceptional with smooth curved edges and elegant textures of soft-touch metal. One problem that is apparent and has been stated multiple times is the weight of the device. It is too heavy to hold comfortably with one hand and the wrist may feel sore or achy after long periods of use. At the time of release, the screen was good enough for the average person to use. However, now with HD screens on devices less than half the size, the iPad's screen is seeming to pale in comparison. In addition, the battery life is quite exceptional. It lasts for weeks in Standby mode and also for long duration while reading or watching movies. Another point is that the cameras on the device are extremely poor, the resulting pictures looking too pixelated to view. You can forget about low-light shooting, because of a lack of flash and a poor image sensor.\nSoftware:\niOS has always been a novel user interface, not for the unlimited functions, but for the extremely easy to use USER INTERFACE. Heck, I have seen kids not even 2 years old who know how to unlock and play their favorite games on the devices. The app store offers an abundance of games, and \"productivity\" apps. However, these productivity apps are not that easy to use. Lots of fonts supported by Microsoft Word do not work on these apps and the formatting is often completely messed up when transitioning from my laptop to the iPad. Apple needs to get Microsoft to build a preloaded app that will be accessible from other places in the OS.\n\nOverall:\nIt's hard to recommend a product which is primarily limited to games, but if you're looking for an entertainment device, I would recommend the iPad 3 or 4 which have better graphics, a better processor, and a better screen. For the price, this is a good buy."}

This means that when you get a map of where you are going later, you can take a screen shot that will go right to your photos (camera roll) and then you can go there and email or text it to anyone else so they have a map to meet you there! You can do this with anything on your screen!!!! What a fantastic tool!\nAnother thing I love that people don't often know about is in the settings, general, accessibility section there are two things you can just turn on and they will read you almost anything out loud on your iPad!  One of them was created for differently abled people and one is more basic.  Speak over and Auto Text are the ones to look for respectively if you'd like to try these! They do take some getting used to.\nOne other thing I learned late in my use of this is that when you are looking at emails, you do not have to open them before deleting them.  If you just swipe your finger across one you know is spam a delete button will come up and you can delete it without ever opening it.\nI will add more fun tips as I learn them myself!"}

I can't stand the way that Apple nickle and dimes you for everything. Almost every App on iTunes costs money, where as most Apps on Play are free. My wife's iPhone 4S was having problems the other day, so I called Apple Care. I was told that I needed to create an Apple Care account for $29.99, just so I could talk to a customer service rep!.......Are you freaking kidding me?! What kind of costumer service is that? Ok, here's your iPad, want to personalize it?..........Too bad! Want to hook it to your TV, without buying a $100 Apple TV module?.............Too Bad! Want to use a YouTube app?.........Too bad! Want to use Google maps?..........Too bad! Want to use your Gmail account without it being gliche?........Too bad! Want to use Google search engine, without it constantly saying, \"Invalid URL\"?...........Too bad! Here's your iPad. Take it or leave it. You can't personalize it or do what you want, because we are Apple, the most powerfull cooperation in the world, and we know what you want way more than you do.\n\nMy next tablet or phone will NEVER be Apple,  but if all the people like being bent over and having it stuck in their pooper, by all means keep throwing your money at Apple. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice; shame on me.\n\nPeople keep comparing the hardware and software of current Android tablets vs. Apple iPads, but that isn't the issue. Apple tells you what you can and can't do with its devices. It's like buying a Ferrari and having it governed at 40 MPH. Why would anyone do this?"}

Now I know the old Kindle doesn't really have the features of the Apple IPAD 2 but, My Kindle is going on two years old and I really stopped useing it when I got my IPAD 2. But,furthmore my Kindle is still not broke, damaged, nor has any loss of batterie life,but it's A totally different story when it comes to the IPAD....First of all I have got say I took extremely great care of my IPAD but, somehow within 3 months it started to show scratches of the back of it. Moveover, it about the fifth or sixth month of owning my IPAD 2 It fell of a three and a half foot table(on to carpet) and the whole screen just shattered, the charging port was also almost totally destroyed and the little circle button that which is 100% the most important part of the IPAD even working at all was destroyed completely. I Called Apple and Asked if they could possibly fix my IPAD 2 64GB oh yea which my parents spent $730.00 dollars for and guess what they said........no, come on keep thinking-_-....................... they said \"for another $400.00 bucks we'll give you a new IPAD 2(the same one White/64GB)and we'll of course transfer the data from your other one to the new one.\" Well,as you could imagine my parents were't about to do that so I was and am stuck with a half broken IPAD and no way to fix it thanks Apple! It wasn't a total loss intil, I couldn't even use my IPAD anymore which happened about two months ago. Now since I can't use the Circle part of the the device I have to turn it off just to switch programs!! I end up now just useing my laptop for everything. I have IPOD and that's great but, APPLE's IPADS' suck badly.

Apple, by necessity, replaced it at its Reston, VA store. That brand new replacement iPad failed again within just 4 months (Serial number DKVHG0MNDFJ0). The Apple store in Reston VA refused to fix or replace it, hiding behind a claimed \"3 month warranty for (new) replacements. (ref. its store manager, Ingrid H.), even though it was less than 5 months old.\n\nAnyone thinking of buying an Apple product should decide for themselves if they want to buy a product from a company that refuses to replace it a mere 5 months after it was obtained new from that company.\n\nFOLLOW-UP 10 MONTHS LATER: YET ONE MORE HARDWARE FAILURE THAT APPLE REFUSED TO REPLACE\n\nA new Ipad-2 from Apple's Reston, VA store failed again, 10 months after it was bought brand new directly from Apple. This time it was the main camera. Again, Apple refused to replace it even though it was a brand new product that failed within 10 months from purchase. Apple's self-service reasoning was again that the product, which was bought at a slightly discounted price FROM APPLE because of the previous reported hardware failure, had only a 3 month warranty (even though brand new).\n\nThat adds up to three iPad 2's with 64GB that failed within around a year, often much less than that and Apple refused to repair or replace them at no charge.\n\nYou can draw your own conclusions."}

Any app from cooking to taking the placement test to college to great games like BAD piggies,BASTION,Sonic the hedgehog, etc the app store has it ALL.

I am able to do so much on it I am able to read, play games, go on the internet etc.\n\nOne thing that i enjoy is the screen is very clear, I personally don't have any problems reading or seeing anything!\n\n  One thing that I enjoy to do in my Ipad is read quotes and sayings. I love how fast i can save them. My computer takes forever to download things like that. All you have to do is push one button and you are done!\n\n  One other thing that i love about the Apple Ipad 2 is that you can set up a lock so nobody can get into it (like my little brother). I am the only one that can get into it! I love it.\n\n  I think the ipad 2 is truly amazing! You can do so much on it. You can do the same things that you can on a computer, maby more! there is really nothing I dislike about the Ipad 2. Also I don't have any problems doing, seeing, hearing anything!\n\nI think the Apple Ipad 2 is amazing for anyone and everyone who loves reading, playing games, and going on the internet. Any age!"}

It has really cool features. It has a camera and it can play videos and movies. It can also play games, surf the web, and more! Sometimes my dad lets me use it. Most of the time, I enjoy using it. Also, it's pretty much a big IPod Touch. This product can be your all in one device!\n\n  I really like Apple products, and this product is a pretty good Apple product.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The hardware is great, but the associated software is shoddy. I've been struggling with Apple's email client for months, resulting in lost email and hours of wasted time! For example, I've searched for email that I can even see in the Inbox, just as a test, and the software can't find it. I've reverted to web-based email. Apple ought to be ashamed. Further, the OS led me to expect to be able to enlarge views, but that only works sometimes. Finally, the touch screen's copy, select, and paste functions are incredibly  frustrating. If you are clicking on small text and want to cut and paste, it's sometimes impossible to select the correct spot, and I've wasted a total of hours trying to do this basic function. An alternative would be arrow keys in the software (on-screen) keyboard, but there are none! Great hardware is one thing, but if the user is constantly frustrated by the software, then the overall experience is terrible. I've also given up, even after downloading Google's app, trying to edit my Google docs. I was ready to sell my used iBook and just rely on my iPad, but I am often soooo relieved to be back to an easier to use interface, that I'm afraid I'll have to keep both. Ridiculous! Apple is going to lose customers once the word really gets out."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Electronics have become part of our everyday life. They help to define who we are by being a source of connection to the world. An iPad is what has been my connection and has transformed my life exceedingly. It also enhanced every aspect of my life in many unique ways. My iPad 2 is reliable, family/school friendly and has also served as a memory book for me.\nApple has been in existence for decades, since 1976, and has grown to become our apple and nutrition of the day providing us iPhones, Macs, iPods and iPads. Apple has become a very trustworthy brand. Before I purchased the iPad on Amazon I needed to confirm that it was going to be worth my time, effort and money. I was blown away by the results of the reviews it had obtained throughout the years. Most of the reviews had given it a five star rating. At that point I knew I needed to buy my iPad 2. I anticipated its arrival anxiously because of the great qualities the product had. In the end, it was everything I had imagined it to be.\nMy brothers fell in love with it as much as I did, or possibly even more. I started exploring my iPad, downloading games and taking pictures. I am amazed at how much one little device can calm and contain children. I have four hyper active brothers and sisters and my iPad has worked miracles on them. They all sit down and as one quietly plays on the iPad, the others patiently wait for their turn. Before my siblings would be jumping and running around everywhere, yelling and fighting about everything. After that point my mom always carried my iPad and she is now buying one for herself. My iPad has become very helpful when it comes to school. I can take notes on it. I complete my homework on it.as type up my essays; watch instructive videos, take educational pictures and much more.  It also converts to a television on weekends. The screen is big enough to watch movies on it, browse Netflix and watch almost anything else. I have grown an emotional connection with my iPad and if you have a family or go to school, I know it will be the perfect product for you as well because it has the capability of helping one though any struggle that may arise.\nNot only is it an amazing device because of the things it can do but it is also easy to carry around. It is very portable and lightweight compared to carrying a laptop. A laptop does not have the same durability as an iPad. The iPad will hold many memories; it will be like a digital scrapbook that you can easily access and always retain. The iPad memory is what preserves those special moments with your pets, family and anything that is very dear to your heart. The iPad may be purchased with different types of memory according to what it will be used for. Also because it is so transportable it has a great battery capacity, making the life of the iPad longer. Lastly, the iPad's 2 cameras will capture many memorable and wonderful moments. The camera captures clear and vivid images that will last a lifetime.\nMy iPad has been a huge focus in my life. I believe it will be a long lasting item that I will not become bored of or toss in the corner like another abandoned electronic. I will always feel confident in recommending this item and what better place to purchase it than Amazon. Amazon has everything for a better, cheaper price; it is dependable and has the option for fast shipping if needed. My life truly has been blessed by this prodigious electronic. I agree with most people that this item deserves a five star rating. It has been two years since I have bought my iPad and I continue to be a very happy costumer, and will continue to be a consumer of apple products in the future."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "So first let me say I looked and drooled over the iPad 2 for what felt like forever!!! It came to a cross roads where my husband said if you can prove to me that you need it you can get it... Well need and want are two very different things but I justified the purchase by listing all the functions and daily life the iPad would help with. I got my way and when I got my iPad was thrilled with what I had expected to be a super functioning and helpful tool. I hadn't realized just how wonderful it would be. From movies, music, books, shows, orginization, games and productivity, the iPad has made waves throughout my house. My husband has since admitted the need for more than one iPad in a single household. He is on it almost as much as me! Our 4 year old has found it to be enthralling and has provided a great outlet for learning, and entertainment!  It is easy to use, even for the kiddos and has provided our family with a great helper on long trips. Some of the apps are expensive but that is okay when you are choosy with your needs. Most apps have a free version. I have gotten pretty fast on the keyboard. The iPad connects easily to available wifi and makes using the feature painless. I love my iPad! I reccomend a case immediately! With an investment such as this you can't be too careful. Usually you can find them online or in discount stores. Because the model is the same size as the previous iPad and will likely be the same as the iPad 3 screen protectors need not be outrageously priced. I have had issues finding all the books and magazines I thought there would be, however I expect in short order there will be releases. Apple is always coming out with new and innovative products, accessories and updates. Great purchase!!! I am very satisfied. I am a Android lover, and iPad almost has me convinced I need an iPhone on my next go-round!! We shall see! If you don't have an iPad, don't hesitate, get it, it is well worth the price."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I've had my iPad, which I bought used, since the end of April 2012.  I bought it to read articles (both academic PDF's and online fare via Instapaper) and play silly games, and it has exceeded my expectations on both counts.  I had used both a 7\" and 10\" Android tablet (modded Nook Color and gTablet, respectively) and a 4th generation iPod Touch in the past for pretty much the same purposes as with the iPad, and found myself not turning them on and subsequently selling them, so I was skeptical of how useful I'd find the iPad vs. a laptop or desktop.\n\nThe advantage over the iPod Touch is just a matter of real estate.  The interfaces of the universal apps that I've used (ones that are available on both the iPod Touch and iPad) are much better on the iPad.  Not to knock Android, because I was admittedly using heavily modded versions of it and didn't have access to the entire Market (now Google Play, I guess), but there really are a ton of good apps available on the App Store.  There are good, efficient implementations of board games, silly puzzle games, a perfectly fine browser experience, good Dropbox, Instapaper, and Evernote apps; I could go on, but, really, there are just a ton of ways to use the iPad well.  I don't use it for much productivity (outside of Evernote and Dropbox), so I couldn't speak to that aspect.  But as a fun device that's useful to me, it's easy to recommend it to others.  If you want to spend the extra $100 for retina display, sure, go ahead and get the third generation one.  If you're struggling between the iPad 2 and other companies' tablets, though, I say go with the Apple."}

While deciding which to buy, I concluded that newer models (generations) are being made all the time and it is too hard to keep up. I ultimately chose the iPad 2 based on price.\n\nPros:\nI was very impressed with how quickly my item arrived. I ordered it on a Thursday and was told I could expect it the following Wednesday-Friday. I received it the next Monday (4 days after ordering, including the weekend). In fact, i received the ipad prior to receiving the case. The packaging was great and there weren't any tears or major dents to the original box. The iPad was secure and protected.\n\nCons: Some of the apps are not formatted for the larger screen of the iPad. For example, Instagram remains the size of a cell phone screen. There is an option to magnify the screen in the lower left hand corner, however the display becomes pixilated.\n\nOverall: I'm familiar with Apple products and am pleased with the product. It is easy to navigate and use. I am very pleased with my purchase."}

A million flakes of shattered glass later, it was repaired, but it was by far the most difficult electronics repair I've attempted.  Apple will repair the glass for $199-$399, depending on the trim level of the Ipad.  Not only is that expensive for what essentially is a sheet of glass, but it's doubly insulting that the cost of the glass depends on how much the Ipad originally retailed for."}

But the problem with it...well, I'll get to that.\nThe hardware itself.. that's where i got a bone to pick.\nIt slipped out of my hands one day and it hit my tile floor,and the screen cracked.

These things are fragile, which makes me wonder why anyone would trust these things to a kid under 5.\nSpeaking of fragile,ive dropped the ipad on -carpet- before and the video output on the screen turned green and well.. broken. If you want to see this for yourself: Google \"iPad Green screen problem\".\nFinally, I bet you are wondering: What about those apps I bought? My ipad still sounds usuable,so I still use them,right?\nWell, yes,and no. The thing is when I dropped my iPad,I was -moving- it. I still use all my apps,but the only good ones i got from it were universal: So when I say i'm using them,I mean on my iPhone.\nSo,to bring it all back home: Its just an overpriced piece of technology that you probably will stop using after 6 months, give or take how much you have to pour into it to find uses for it."}

It was in the original packaging with all attachments included. The outer packaging was torn, leaving some of the inner package exposed; however, the product was not damaged.  As for the iPad2, it is indistinguishable from my 3rd generation iPad, except that it is noticeably lighter in weight, and is thus easier to hold. Having used the 3rd generation iPad for several months, I see no reason to pay the extra $$$ for it over the iPad 2. Unless one has ultra-superior eyesight, the display on the 2 is just as good as the 3."}

It has to be done in the computer,and then moved to the ipad.

The head supervisor there confirmed that the policy and design of Apple is such that it\n\nleaves no options with the customer, but to re-buy another piece even if the touch screen is cracked.\n\nIn my case, the screen got cracked due to keeping the iPad under my pillow after my night time reading. They requested me to send the picutures of the cracks\n\nand said that the cracks are due to external pressure and hence do not come under warranty, leaving me with no other option but to not use the Apple iPad\n\nanymore due to safety reasons. I am left only with this option because I don't want to buy another same product in its replacement. I can as well buy similar\n\nproduct from other company's offering.\n\nI even offered to give back the product and give me atleast some money. But they said that Apple doesn't have repurchase policy in India.\n\nIn addition, the other known Apple issues like unable to play videos ( due to non compatibility of flash player), low sound, no external ports provided like\n\nHDMI, USB etc. The maintenance is also a rip-off. Please note that you will have to buy seperate Apple accessories if you desire to have ports to connect\n\nwith other non-Apple devices. Even the sound is low to inspire customer to buy external speakers. The intersting thing is that other similar products in\n\nmarket have these things built in.\n\nHaving burnt my hands after buying my first \"Apple\" product, I have decided not to buy any future Apple products and highly recommend not to waste so much of anybody's hard earned money to buy such a product.

I didn't want to have to pay for a data plan and saved money on the cost of the iPad. That was the right choice for me. I use it all over the place with free wi fi spots so widely available. There are so many apps available that you can customize it for your needs very easily. This almost replaces my laptop computer. I hardly ever turn on the laptop anymore. The iPad runs faster than my laptop on most things online. I bought my iPad after falling in love with the one that I was issued for use in my special education class. I have been totally amazed at the things that I have seen happening in my classroom with the iPad. Any teacher, homeschoolers, or parent should have at least one iPad strictly for the kids. They are great learning tools with so many educational apps available--most free or low cost. And if you have a special needs child or student, then you doubly need an iPad for their use. It is much easier to use than a conventional computer for special needs children. And if you have a child with any disability on the Autism spectrum than you absolutely, without a doubt MUST have an iPad for your child. There are hundreds of apps designed just for people with Autism. If for no other reason than to use as an augmented communication system device, you must get this for your child with Autism.\n\nIf I am asked to name one flaw with the iPad, it is that it cannot be cleaned. The screen gets lots of finger prints and gunk on it--especially with children using it. And it will get scratches on the screen, no matter how careful you are. If using it in a classroom with lots of children it can be a germ breeding ground since you cannot wipe it down with disinfectant. At school, we stick them inside gallon zip close storage bags as a good protective covering that can be thrown out and replaced cheaply. Screen protectors are a must have accessory."}

Like most people, I use the iPad 90% of the time on just a few Apps. For me, reading an ebook, checking stock quotes, and reading the news constitute most of what I do. It's good to have half a million Apps, but it's impossible to use that many, or even a fraction of that. I've compared the iPad to the Kindle for reading ebooks. For me, the iPad is the clear winner. In my opinion, the iPad is easier to read and is sharper, also the color is a plus. The Kindle is hard to read in low light. Maybe if you are outside, the Kindle would have the edge, but I never read outside, and I think most people don't (possibly some do at the beach). I have an iPad 1 with WiFi and 3G, and an iPad 2 with WiFi only. I think the WiFi is the way to go because of the cost savings. Sometimes the 3G is nice, but I don't use it that often. Bottom line, I can recommend either model. It's reliable, easy to use, and Apple has the updates to improve things or fix any bugs that crop up."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "There's no question the iPad is an amazing device. Life is better now that I own one. With all the hype about it though I really expected it to be slightly better than it is.  It's hard to rate this exactly 3 or 4 stars so I'd rank it closer to four. Below summarizes why.\n\nPROs:\nIt's amazingly fast.\nAmazing battery life and the exact battery remaining percentage icon is a great feature instead of the usual cellphone-like icon showing a quarter, half, etc. Battery life is really one of the best things about it.\nIt turns on instantly and is ready for anything. Shuts down and sleeps just as quick. You almost never have to shut it down to undo a lockup. Notice I said \"almost\".\nLoads websites fast, and almost all apps work problem-free.\nTons of content available, much of it free or just $.99\nBuilt well and damn-near bulletproof case. It looks sleek and you don't want to put it down once you start using it.\nIt's lightweight and I don't notice it getting hot. So much more pleasant to use on the couch than a laptop. If you haven't spent an evening browsing the net from your couch with the iPad, you don't know what you're missing.\n\nCONs:\nSadly the cons are quite significant in my mind. Doesn't mean I'm taking it back but kind of amazing that Apple didn't address this with the ipad2. First, the lack of flash support on the iPad is HIGHLY ANNOYING.  I cannot overstate this. I have read many reviews and talked to enough fan-boys that tell me flash is outdated and isn't going to be used much longer, HTML 5 will replace it, on and on. To that I say YEAH RIGHT.  Flash is everywhere. Many major corporations and product companies use flash on their sites. If you cant run it, you WILL miss out on content. I had no idea how big this was until i got an ipad.\nIf you use amazon you need flash. Otherwise forget watching any product videos. To have to move to a desktop because my tablet won't do flash is unacceptable. I have heard that apple chose not to allow it due to battery life issues, but this doesn't seem like a valid enough point. It's probably more than this: political between adobe and apple. Here's a newsFLASH: how about just giving us the option to turn flash browsing off if battery life is the real reason? Maybe I'd rather have four hrs of battery life and be able to watch video than have 10 hrs of battery. This is the most glaring problem with the iPad and if you are in the market for a tablet, do your comparison shopping and check the android tablets before you decide. Wish I had. This is a problem I encounter almost every day.\n\nLack of a back button-there is not always a way to 'back out' of an application on the ipad as there is with other tablets, again namely the android tablets. Sometimes you get knee deep in an application and hit a wall, the only way out is to hit the home bezel button which means you have to close and  start the app over. With other tablets you just go back one step.  Not a huge annoyance, but annoying nonetheless and probably happens every other day or so.\n\nText ain't that sharp-I thought for sure owning an iPad I'd have razor sharp text just like the razor sharp graphics on the rest of the unit. Not so. Text is just 'ok'.  I just find myself having to blow things up sometime to view them clearly, and I have good vision. This may be a little knit picky... Text is fairly sharp as you enlarge and stretch content. I have read some other reviews touting sharper text on competing tablets though.\n\nSafari ain't that great either-safari is extremely limited and again apple won't let you have Firefox for the iPad. Basically I think safari provides a far less pleasing browsing experience. My main gripe is that safari will not 'wordwrap'. This means when you zoom in on a web pages the article will stroll horizontally which means extra work to have to read it. (Your home computer will wrap the text automatically, meaning the article or web page way get longer in length, but stays  only one screen length in width.... This makes for an easier reading experience).\nIf you do lots of reading online this can get tiring constantly having to scroll horizontally as well as vertically without word wrap. This isn't a problem on the kindle fire and android phones, I presume it isn't a problem on their tablets, either.\n\nThe war against Google-it's no secret apple and Google will one day be even more of direct competitors than they are now, and I find that gmail sometimes just will not open on the iPad. It hangs up and locks up the unit, and I mean LOCKS UP the unit rendering the rest of safari useless until I can get it to calm down and close out.  I have no idea why but gmail is the only website that gives me a problem in safari. It's annoying and I feel unnecessary.  it's not my Internet and not my WiFi either because it works on every other computer and device in the house.  There is a gmail app, but I share the tablet with other people and kids and I want my email access separately in a browser. Sadly gmail and the iPad don't mix and that sucks.\n\nSUMMARY:\nDespite the gripes above the iPad is still a marvelous machine, albeit not perfect. It's loads better than using a laptop for daily surf and email. You probably won't regret buying one, and if you do the high resale value means you'll have not problem unloading it. If you are a Google or android user, you do owe it to yourself to check out the android tablets side by side before making a purchase. I can tell you for sure that for browsing the net and reading articles, Google's android built in browser is loads better than safari.  I think the iPad had been incorrectly assumed as being vastly superior because it's apple, but it has some major flaws.\nHowever even with those it is still as a whole a superb machine. It's an amazing piece of technology and far superior for web browsing than a computer or laptop. Just a personal tip--if you're on the fence about what color to get, go with white. Black is cool too, but white will stay looking cleaner (black shows every fingerprint) and will not show little nicks and scratches on the case like black will.\nThanks for reading."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I did quite a bit of research before finally deciding on buying the iPad 2. The iPad was easily my last choice of all  tablets when i started my search, because i have had a bad history with apple and i swore off all of there products. I noticed a trend when i start going deep into the reviews and previews of competitor tablets, and that trend was that everything hoped to rival the iPad. There are decent alternatives, but unfortunately the iPad is still the tablet to beat.\n\nI choose the iPad 2 of the iPad 3, because for the upgrades from the predecessor were not of any interest. I take photos on a dslr, and if i want to watch HD videos then i can watch them on my laptop.\n\nSo far i am guilt fully enjoying the iPad 2. It has proved to me more useful than I envisioned: It's productivity apps work across multiple platforms, it's home to one of my favorite card games (magic 2013!), and it's internationally user friendly (chinese gf).\n\nMy biggest complaint is more on the OS and hardware side of things. I wish that the iOS allowed for exporting files to an external hdd. That would have made this product prefect for me."}

The tablet that all other tablets are measured against.\n\nYes Apple has released the new iPad (or what the rest of us call the iPad 3). Apple Marketing, please think about your naming conventions in the future! But I still love my iPad 2!\n\nI use my iPad 2 just about every day. I mainly use it for reading email when I don't feel like pulling out the Macbook Pro. I also use it as an eReader (Amazon, Nook, Safari Books online, MacTech magazine, iBooks, etc). No it's not the retina display. But if you can't afford the retina display this is the next best thing. I can read this one just fine, so no upgrading for me.\n\nI didn't choose one with a data plan (would have been 3G when I bought this - last year), but I don't find that I need one. One hint on the data: If you can find a decent mifi data plan then you can just get the wifi version of the iPad and be done with it. Even so, I find wifi hotspots all over the place (including my house of course, which is where I use it a lot).\n\nThe camera is ok, but I use my iPhone for pics, so I really don't care. They could have substituted the camera for some other feature and I would have been just as happy.\n\nIt is an awesome game platform as it gives you more space to play with. It also works great with the Apple TV and streaming audio.\n\nYes, Android tablets are catching up, but they still aren't there yet. They don't have the price point of an iPad nor the consistency of the user experience.\n\nThe iPad is also a durable product: I have dropped mine, and only had small cracks appear on the bezel, with no affect on performance whatsoever. Still I recommend some kind of case. The smart cover is good, but doesn't protect the back. I'm still looking for my ultimate case.\n\nI have made it through an entire plane ride (cross-country 6 hr trip) without running down the battery completely.\n\nLooking for the best Tablet experience, don't want to have to figure out some convoluted interface? Buy the iPad."}

It was the most expensive case that Target carried. The case will not open without inserting something in one of the open slots and twisting. When I did that, the screen exploded so that I have cracks running in all directions. I have purchased a new computer from Apple every year for nearly 15 years. I have 4 iPad and an iPhone plus software and I have purchased at least 20 iPods.  I have tried returning the brand new iPad to both Target and Apple. Both dogmatically refuse to help me. Apple said I would have to pay $200 to replace it.  So far, no response from Griffin.  I am sick over this. Apple is horrible in terms of their customer service now.  The used to recognize stuff like this.  I have had so many good experiences with them over the years and now they've stopped standing behind their products.  The iPad should not have done this and the case should not have been so difficult to open.  The Apple store made good and sure that I couldn't buy an extended warranty by documenting the fact that the iPad was cracked.  I am crying as I write this because the good that this company once was is now dead. I loved them because they were always recognizing my loyalty to them and in return showed that same dedication to me.  Now that's dead."}

Nevertheless, the release of the New iPad brings forth a new question: Should you buy the now cheaper iPad 2?\n\nThere are many factors to be considered when making this purchase. The main upgrades of the New iPad include retina display, faster processor, better cameras, and with iOS 6, siri. My family owns both the iPad 2 and the New iPad. Apple did not change the iPad much between these two generations. It kept the same battery life, the same thickness (almost), and the same design. Thus, it is a personal decision.\nThe devices are very similar, and most of the cons of the iPad 2 are fixed in the New iPad. However, is the upgrade worth $100-150?\n\nCons of iPad 2 and how the New iPad uses them:\n\nLack of Retina Display: When the iPad 2 was released, retina display had already been seen in other apple devices, like the iPod touch 4th generation. The general public was disappointed by the lack of this feature in the iPad 2. The iPad 3 had this feature. However, I don't really notice the difference. They both appear to have excellent displays. The New iPad's improved display can only be identified in rare conditions, such as viewing upgraded apps or sharp photos. Overall, the retina display in the iPad increases the memory many apps in the app store take up. For example, many iPad 2 users posted bad reviews about Monopoly HD when they had an update that increased the memory that app took up extensively. The update of Monopoly HD did not bring any new features besides Retina display. iPad 2 users were angry because now they lost memory without any benefits.\n\nLack of better Cameras: The iPad 2's cameras are terrible. They back facing camera is .7 megapixels. On a smaller screen this would be acceptable because it is still HD, but on a 10 in. screen photos shot by the iPad camera look pixelated. The New iPad is said to have 5 megapixel cameras. Even so, the cameras on the New iPad aren't that great. Look at the video I posted so you can see the difference yourself. The video is best viewed in full screen.\n\nFaster Processor: The iPad 2 has a decent processor and is capable of doing everything you can currently do on an iPad decently. The iPad 3 is faster, especially when loading apps. The upgrade is great but not necessary.\n\nSiri: With iOS 6, the New iPad will have exclusive new abilities like Siri. Although many are not appreciative of siri after seeing it on the iPhone, the fact that the New iPad will now have it suggests that apple will continue to do this. Apple's newest products will continue to receive features that older products won't have through updates. Thus, it may be a good idea to purchase the New iPad as another one is not expected soon."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I'll start by being brutally honest here and admit that initially I doubted Apple's Ipad when it was initially released in 2010. I didn't see much utility for it and frankly thought it was a bit silly and I wasn't all for it. I didn't see much use for it although I recognized it was a nifty, cool little device but thought it was a bit too much like an Ipod touch. Forward to 2012 I now am the owner of an Ipad 2 and loving it, I'm converted. It wasn't until I had the opportunity to spend time experimenting and playing with the tablet that I saw myself using it me and bringing it along with me, in short wanting one. I've owned an Ipad for a little over two weeks and with this time passed by I've had enough time to enjoy and experiment enough with this device that now seems to be the right time to review it. If you must know I went for the Ipad 2 simply because I liked how remarkably slim and light it was and although the Ipad 3 has the new retina display, to me it didn't significantly expand the second generation of Apple tablets for me to pay a hundred dollars more (money is important after all and is a deciding factor) to have the \"new\" product I decided. I read reviews and articles, comparisons between the second and third generations of Ipad and came to the conclusion that I'd be well off with 16 GB Ipad 2 and from then on would decide whether or not to upgrade to one of the future Ipads depending on my use and enjoyment of the tablet.\n\nYou can say all you want but no one presents and markets a product quite like Apple is capable of (and does). They're often criticized for how expensive their products are yet they are everywhere and well designed and thought and they're hard to ignore.  Apple had success with the Mac and Mac book and their different models, the Ipod, the Iphone (all with variations and updated models of the same product) and more recently with the Ipad. I'll be the first to admit Apple's gadgets and electronic devices can be expensive but I've also never had a problem with any apple product I've owned in the past.\n\nThe size is one of the best thing about the Ipad, it's neither too big nor too small and the screen is big, bright and clear and there's just so much you can do. The interface is excellent; it feels and works great, looks neat and simplistic and it's very easy to catch on. It just feels natural and anyone from a child to a grandparent can use it and understand the bare basics an enjoy it. The applications or \"apps\" as they are called are truly what MAKE the Ipad the innovative device that it is, otherwise it does a lot of what your Iphone/Ipod touch or Laptop/Desktop do which is still keep in mind, excellent. There are ton of apps for different needs be it for reading books and magazines, to taking notes, playing fun games and everything in between. There are ton of apps already on the market, some brilliant and very useful to some downright stupid and new ones are constantly being created. Many apps are free, not most but a good quantity are and the range from the 0.99-1.99-2.99-3.99... 9.99 etc.  There are apps that serve as business tools, diverse utilities, fun mindless games like the popular Angry Birds, there's Safari as the internet browser, you can set up you e-mail accounts, manage your bank account, make hotel reservations etc. The list goes on please believe! There's of course Itunes from which you can buy music, movies and more and have them uploaded instantly to your Ipad. You can also sync it to any existing Itunes account and select material to upload to the device. I also like that there is both an inward and outward camera like on the Iphone so you can take pictures of anything you see or yourself which is a very nice option I thought I'd mention.  Those programs and apps are all stored in your Ipad via the memory it contains whether it's 16, 32 or 64 GB and ultimately the amount of Gigabytes you have determines how much content can be stored on the Ipad. The battery life is roughly ten hours (of course depending on certain factors such the brightness, volume etc.) which is not bad at all and still better than my laptop.\n\nThese are just a few thoughts and suggestions if you're considering purchasing an Ipad.\n\n-  For me just the Wi-Fi model was fine. However, if you're often on the go and have a need for internet that can't wait and need it \"right now\" all the time without close Wi-Fi access available at all times then maybe you should consider getting a 3G model for just a little more $ with a monthly or pre-paid plan.\n\n-Another thing you might want to consider is the memory you're going to need. The 16G model has in reality 13.9 G (there is always a certain portion of available storage taken before even touch it) and I think for the average user this will be fine (besides you can always remove apps etc. and it does keep track of whatever you've downloaded in case you want it back). Most apps don't take up a whole lot of storage room although some are bigger than others. The same with music, it depends how much you plan to use the Ipad for music and this also applies to the books you buy and how many you plan to buy keep (although the books aren't as bad as the music and movies as far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't worry too much unless you're a hardcore reader who plans to store plenty of books).  If you're planning to upload a lot of movies or have/use a lot of data then perhaps a 32G or 64G model would be a better fit for you considering how movies can easily be over 1GB each. They're more expensive of course but may warrant the consideration if you'd rather have the larger number of Gigabytes but and not take the available space entirely than have one that's filled up soon after.\n\n-If you're interested in owning the latest thing and see potential great things about the Ipad 3 like the retina display and the upgraded processor you may want to go ahead with the newer model. Otherwise the second generation Ipad makes a viable option if you want to save a bit of money, other than that the two devices are basically identical and at first look no one could notice a difference between the 2 and 3. If you're considering either I suggest you do some research as I did, especially if money is an important factor in your decision and then decide for yourself which one it is you want.\n\n-Another somewhat big decision is the color choice, whether you want a black Ipad or a white one. Personally I went with the white one as I liked how it looked and it seems to me that most people I know own the black. The color is not all that important it's what it can do and the options it gives you although some will insist on owning either one color or the other.\n\n-Last you may want to protect the Ipad with a protective screen just in case (it's always better to be prepared) to protect it. You may want to consider purchasing a nice case to store and carry it and maybe even a stylus pen if you think you might be into that type of thing.\n\nIn a world where tablets are rapidly and steadily selling Apple's Ipad has in reality very little competition partly due to clever marketing but mostly due to the great product they delivered.  Don't have a lot of negatives, if any, to say for the most part I am really liking it and find myself using it every single day and it nearly replaces my laptop. It does close to everything I want to do with my laptop usually, for me the Ipad is now one of those things tht I can't live without (not literally but still!).  I made the jump and find myself enjoying the Ipad and like it for its portability which makes it great for travelling and carrying wherever I go. It's entertaining, useful and smooth.  I like that I can have so much in one convenient sized device that doesn't take up a whole lot of space, can access wi-fi, check my e-mails, play games and more. It's not as big or heavy as a laptop, does not overheat even when running for several hours and opens MUCH faster yet it's not so small that it's inconvenient to type or a little hard to read (or touch in the case of my cellular phone) and do tasks with a cell phone, it's a perfect balance if you will. I really don't have anything negative to say about my Ipad, it would be nice in the future to have place for a USB/SD slot and I believe that may be coming eventually.  Obviously I've been praising the Ipad a lot  and I don't regret my purchase, full marks *****."}

We were very happy with the ordering and delivery experience. The iPad 2 is a viable alternative to the iPad 3 if pricing is an issue. The only sacrifices are in not having the Retina display and a lesser megapixel camera - the iOS software and apps are all the same. iPad 2 dimensions are the same as iPad 3 so all iPad accessories are transferable. We opted for the Verizon 3G version even though our daughter uses AT&T cell phone service. You can do this because iPad 3G service can be activated without a long term contract and in general Verizon's data coverage is better than AT&T in our daughter's service area."}

I was a little disappointed with it at first, since it wasn't \"magic\" and didn't really live up to the hype. But I used it for reading books and watching movies, and slowly found myself using it for more and more things, until eventually it replaced my laptop (which, with my netbook, now sits collecting dust most of the time). Between my iPad and my desktop computer, they cover just about everything I need or want a computer for. As a result, I can't see myself buying another laptop, ever. (Or perhaps I will buy one some day as a more mobile replacement for my desktop.)\n\nWhen Apple brought out the \"retina\" iPad, they also dropped the price on the iPad 2, and I bought an Apple-refurbished iPad 2 as an upgrade for my first-gen iPad. But this time, I stuck with wifi-only, since the AT&T 3G was (and is) marginal in my neighborhood, and went with the bottom-end 16GB version because I had never used more than 12 GB of storage on the original iPad.\n\nFor three-fifty plus tax and free shipping, the refurb iPad 2 is a ridiculously good deal. Apple replaces the battery and metal shell--the parts most likely to be damaged or worn out--when they refurbish iPads.  I honestly can't tell that mine is a refurb. It looks and acts like it is brand new.\n\nThe iPad 2 is significantly faster than the original, which I notice mostly while browsing the web, but also with some games. It's lighter, and the battery lasts almost as long. Apple keeps adding features to iOS, so the iPad continues to become more useful. (Thank you, Google, for keeping Apple on their toes.)\n\nI look forward to upgrading to a refurbished  \"retina\" iPad when Apple brings out the next generation. But for now, the iPad 2 is terrific."}

I ordered and paid for an AT&T 3G model with WiFi, thinking I would primarily use it on WiFi and then activate the 3G when needed.  Then I went on vacation a few months later and tried to activate the 3G only to discover that the iPad I received was only a WiFi model.  When I contacted the seller they said they couldn't even find the serial number in their records and were of little assistance.  It was like buying a car with heated seats in the summer, then in the winter you discover the heated seats aren't in the car.  Very frustrating.  I have subsequently learned that you can tell the difference in a 3G model by the black antenna across the rear of the device.

Having had one now for five days, I can't imagine life without one.  I haven't even booted up my laptop since getting it. Granted, I took advantage of the price drop since the release of the 3 but after consulting with several experts informing me that the 2 would be a wise purchase at the lessor price I took the plunge. I'm delighted I did.\n\nI will not get into technical jargon, but what pleasure this product makes computing. At this point, I know that I have barely scratched the surface. It's extremely intuitive and quick. I thought I might have difficulty with the keyboard, but the keys are large enough and respond nicely when touched. Video streams efficiently and I like how quickly the screen self-adjusts from vertical to horizontal and back again. The images are crystal clear and the camera takes great pictures.\n\nI do have an issue and it is a common one with many people that have the IPad, it does not support Flash. Many of the things I do on the net and job-wise use Flash, so I will have to use other devices if an activity uses it. I also own a Kindle Fire and I like it too. Comparatively, the IPad does so much more, but it does come at a higher price. If you just want to be able to do basic web browsing, reading, and watch movies, the Fire is great.  If you want to go above and beyond that, IPad is the way to go."}

I really liked its construction and novel appeal (had ICS) at first and continued to find reasons to improve it thru updates, useful apps, utilities, etc. All throughout I realized that I spent more time researching online for ways to improve  my Android tablet, than the time I was actually enjoying it. There always were issues that had to be remedied and problems that I had to seek  fixes for, the most significant of which was poor battery life and frequent crashes.  I finally got tired of \"babying\" my Android tablet and returned it promptly in new condition. That same day I bought an Apple Ipad 2 from a bricks-and-mortar store. Then I realized someting funny: that this was the third time I returned an Android device in exchange for an Apple.  First, when I returned an Android smartphone for an Iphone two years back. Second, when I returned an Android multimedia device for an Ipod Touch last Christmas. And now, my new Ipad 2 which replaced the Android. I am enjoying both stability and excellent battery life in my Ipad 2 -- and no more researching for fixes and no more \"babying\"!  Was buying the Ipad 2 more expensive? In terms of more cash out the pocket, yes; but in the long-run, I know that my Ipad will pay for itself. Now, I am not the brand conscious type and would readily buy a Coby or Emerson if it works better than a Sony or Samsung. Though I run the risk of sounding like a commercial, in this case of getting a tablet, the Ipad 2 won me over the Android simply because .........it's TRIED and TESTED and it's THAT GOOD."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "- Durability: 10/5\nWhen I say 10/5 I mean it. 3 days after X-mas, I dropped my brand new iPod 4G on a stone-tile floor (about 3-4 feet up) and it shattered (Apple replaced it free of charge :D), yet I'd still give the iPod 4G a 4.5/5 in durability. I've dropped my iPad 2 on the same floor maybe 2x. It got a tiny dent in the aluminum frame. I have dropped this iPad on wood floors, ceramic tile, stone tile, concrete, asphalt, you name it (yes, grass, too). I do not, nor have I ever, had a case on it. Sure, the edges of the case are dented beyond repair, but the screen and (surprisingly) the back of the frame are scuff-free.\nBUT!!! However you drop it, DO NOT drop anything on it! My TV remote slipped from my hand less than 1 foot above my screen, and it obliterated the home button, which I now keep in my pocket. I found it extremely ironic :)\nThe screen is impossible to scratch, however. Not gouge, but scratch. Since it's broken, I ordered a new screen. I decided to see how tough the screens are by scratching one with a nail (as in hammer and nail, not finger nail). It could not scratch it. Since I don't remember much of the Mohs Hardness scale, and I lack a diamond, it's somewhere between a 3 and 10 hardness.\n\n- Personalization .1/5\nApple has too much restricted customer customization of this product. As soon as you get this product, JAILBREAK IT! Jailbreaks are not illegal unless you install illegal sources. If you don't like any aspect of Apple's software designs, from there being a six-icon limit on the dock, to being able to run all your applications in windows or have Siri on the iPad, Jailbreak it. 99.9382% of the time you'll find the tweak you're looking for.\n\n- Size 2.3/5\nFrankly, 2 years ago when I was 13 I was flipping out to get such a big electronic toy. Now I think it's too freaking big. If you want a size that is good for presentations, yet still retaining good mobility, go with an iPad. If you want something you can stick in you're jacket pocket yet still be able to read, get something nearby the size of a Kindle Fire, even though I personally think iPad is 700x better.\n\n- Battery Life 5/5\n...\nI sometimes sit there and watch the battery drain, because I'm afraid if I open an app it will die (obviously this is at maybe 5-30% battery life). Yet sometimes I've found I can play for 4-5 hours, on a 3D game, no less, from 100% to dead.\n\n- Display ...\nThe part we've all been waiting for...\nHonestly, I'd have to say... 4.6/5\nI thought the display was absolutely stunning. That is, until I saw the iPad 3. I started seeing minor (MINOR!!!!!!) flaws on edges. This was mostly in a few particular apps designed for both iPhone and iPad, most of the other apps were just fine.\nIf you don't mind not having 3,100,000 pixels, take 786,432 pixels instead. You won't notice a difference, so long as you avoid iPad 3's.\n\n- Versatility 5/5\nI use this for school, homework, games, browsing the web to buy a new screen, FaceTiming with friends, staying up-to-date with friends, you name it. It even makes a good paperweight :)\n\n- Overall 4.85/5\nVery satisfied."}

Since I am no longer a full time student anymore, there wasn't much of a point other than just entertainment purposes.  All I really like to do is check my email, watch youtube videos, listen to music, and listen to church sermons and play chess.  I wouldn't want to spend a ton of money on something just for those purposes. A cheaper laptop I could have got but they honestly wouldn't last long.  So the Apple Ipad was a perfect idea and it works well for the unimportant stuff I like to do off the internet.  Well worth the price indeed!!!\n\nBy the way, I am not trying to be sarcastic.  The Ipad is a big help for me.  As I have went through periods of depression, I don't know where I would be if it wasn't for being able to listen to the sermons off the internet, nor communicating with my friends through email, and even getting my mind off of things through playing chess and listening to music.

I still remember the error message: \"Viruses are coming.  We will disconnect you from the Internet.  Good Luck.

Gets me on the Internet, and coupled with a Bluetooth enabled keyboard, lets me type out this review and upload it to Amazon.  Every day I try to learn a new feature.  Once in a while, I make the trek to an Apple store, break out my iPad2, and yammer with their geeks about whatever it is I don't understand.  Today, we covered the file synching. Across the aisle, a 5 year old reached up, hit the keyboard on one of the counters, and set off the security alarm.  Next week I'll start taking pictures with the camera.  Baby steps.

I had all these plans and apps to transition a lot of my daily tasks to it, such as news, reading, and notes. However, one by one, I stopped using the iPad for each different task because it's inferior to my other devices in each category. When I read news, I'm either already at my desk and computer already, or I just want to whip out my smartphone and read a quick article. In terms of note-taking, the software options for notes and document editing on the iPad are absolutely awful compared to full PC programs. Furthermore, don't expect to use the touch screen for any real amount of typing. Its auto-correct is very prone to messing you up without you noticing. The list goes on.\n\nSo sure, it's a multi-functional device, but it's basically the worst of all worlds. It was fun at first, but as soon as the novelty wore off, it just became a chore to use the iPad for anything compared to other methods. I eventually realized I was only using it at all to justify my ownership of it, rather than for practical reasons. At last, today, I found it collecting dust in my room and turned it on to discover that I hadn't used it at all in a month.\n\nYes, it is a good looking, small, lightweight device. Yes, it has some useful applications. But for me, your average office worker and college student, is it practical or useful? No."}

I purchased and printed a receipt that also stated that the units were \"New.\"  When received I was disappointed to find that they were Certified Refurbished.  When I tried to return, the seller started an email argument over whether I should have realized the units were not factory new, then said I should try them out before returning, finally said that if I would return them, he would refund upon receipt.  No offer of a label, etc. Afraid if I sent them back I would never see my money. Felt like a bad ebay transaction, not the guaranteed, no-hassle returns that Amazon advertises.  I ended up keeping the units.  Hoping I don't get fired when they fail to perform.  They're ok so far."}

Just the fact that when i want to check something out on the internet i just press a button and voil! All set. The size is perfect for me because I carry my iPad with me wherever I go. It's very easy to use since you have all your apps right there, not like other tablets that are NOT organized at all. I'm a fashion design student and my iPad has turned essential for me. Whenever i see something i like I save it and I look at it when I need inspiration. It became my notebook, there are pretty amazing apps like InClass and Noteability that let you make notes take pictures, video record, and even make voicenotes so it's very complete to me cause i get to have Everything really organized in my classes. The iPad speed is amazing. The keyboard is very easy to use and responsive! If you're a physical keyboard lover I recommend you the ClamCase. It's set up via bluetooth, and it gives you something the other cases don't; you can put your iPad in ALL angles you want since it's 360 degree!\nOne of the things that concern people is the printing... Just save the dang document e-mail it to yourself and print it whenever you want! So.. Is the iPad useful? It REALLY is!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "After being tempted to buy a tablet for many months, when Apple introduced its new generation iPad and, at the same time, dropped the price of the earlier version, the iPad2 by $100 across-the-board, I jettisoned the thoughts about buying a relatively inexpensive Android device with a 7-8\" screen and bought the basic iPad2 with the minimal 16GB and WiFi only. Initially thinking that I was buying a new toy, a `novelty', I soon discovered that the iPad2 is much more than that. I use it for dozens of things I never imagined using one for and have become quite attached to it, especially when travelling or just sitting in my favorite easy chair at home.\n\nA great deal has been written about the technology and capacities of the iPads, so I will not waste your time reiterating them here. Suffice it to say that this one is the most basic model available. It requires a WiFi connection to operate and its total storage capacity is what seems like a `mere' 16GBs. My focus here is more on my personal experience with my first tablet. I am glad that I waited for the iPad.\n\nBeing a 65 year old man, my are no longer nimble enough to manage the tiny keys on a Smart Phone nor is my vision acute enough to read things easily on a 3\" screen.  On the iPad, however, with its 9.7\" screen and keypad that is entirely adequate, I have become quickly facile.\n\nThe limited memory is entirely adequate as I do not download and keep movies and am not an accumulator of music. The memory is needed to manage the necessary receiving elements of the various applications (Apps) that I choose to install the capacities for. Many are free, a lot of them cost between 99 cents and $3.99 and some cost more. The most expensive one I have is called \"Pages\" and is a comprehensive word processing and office management suite. Compared to the prices of `installable' programs, this is remarkable cheap. Some of my favorite apps are free, like voice recording capacities and \"GoSkyWatch\", an App that looks at the night sky through the out-facing camera and shows what constellations are there. It is like having my own telescope.\n\nThe 20-30 Apps I currently have installed have used about 2GBs of the total available hard drive. I don't expect to run out. The exclusive use of WiFi vs. 3G has a pro and con to it. In the Pro column, WiFi is pretty universally available in most places and it requires no paid data plan to access the internet and use all of the iPad's features. On the Con side of the ledger, the device is usable ONLY where there is a WiFi connection available. With 3G and a data-plan, the iPad can connect from anywhere you can access a signal for your cell phone.\n\nAt this time, for my own purposes, this basic iPad2 has been a rather surprising delight. I understand that the camera resolution on the third generation iPad is far superior, but what I see on this iPad2 is perfectly adequate for me - and, I expect, for most other people as well.\n\nThe price is right and the product is truly outstanding."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "After owning a Kindle 3 for a year, then a Kindle Fire for 6 months, I am now the proud owner of an iPad 2. I am also in a position to compare the two tablets without any bias at all.\n\nFirst, why the switch? The Kindle Fire is a great tablet, much better than the Kindle 3 in my opinion because of the apps, the small size, the backlit screen, and the Silk browser. And for many months now I have compared the iPad at a distance to the Kindle Fire, and I kept coming back with \"why would I want to spend $500 on an iPad when I can get a Fire for $200? I already own a laptop. Why would I need so much functionality in an eBook reader?  The iPad solves a problem that I do not have.\"\n\nBut the advantages of the iPad only become apparent once you own one. That's when the large screen makes you realize how much you squinted at the Fire's smaller screen. How much smoother the Safari browser works than the Silk browser. And how much better the selection of apps are on the iPad.\nSo, once the new iPad came out and the iPad 2 price dropped by $100, I found myself thinking seriously about it. And before I knew it, I had one. And I like it. I like it a lot.\n\nNow, I am still a huge Amazon fan and have no intention of leaving Amazon, so the thought of reading books and watching Amazon Prime videos on a non-Kindle device filled me with a bit of trepidation. Can it all work as nicely on the iPad as it does on the Kindle Fire? The answer is \"Yes\", with one rather large exception: video. Unfortunately videos (TV shows & movie's) downloaded from Amazon require Adobe Flash which Apple does not support on its mobile devices, so that was my first disappointment. But that's been my only disappointment so far and it turns out that it's not a huge problem at all. All of the other pluses of the iPad make up for that. There is plenty of video for the iPad: it's all on iTunes, and a lot of it is free. The Kindle reader works just fine on the iPad 2, in fact its nicer with the large screen.  Book prices on Amazon and Apple appear to be identical. Although the iPad 2 is larger and heavier than the Fire, it's not that much heavier to be a hindrance and I don't see it being any more difficult to slip into my travel bag. Battery life is about the same. But for sure the apps available on the iPad are a welcome sight compared to the Kindle, in both the quantity and quality. This is really where the scale tips heavily in Apple's favor. Sure, Android has thousands of apps available, but Amazon does not let you have them on the Kindle. You are restricted to only downloading the apps that Amazon has approved for the Kindle Fire, and that turns out to be a disappointingly small number of apps, many of which are of mediocre quality.  I would find myself eagerly searching the Kindle app store for the same apps that I enjoy on the iPhone, only to find that they are simply not available for the Kindle Fire. Apps like Skype, Evernote, TED, PBS,  Dropbox, Voxer, SayHi, WeightWatchers mobile, and plenty more. Another experience that is much better on the iPad is watching the news and documentaries while I walk on my treadmill. The bigger screen is a huge improvement and with all the great apps for news and shows, there truly is no end to what you can watch. Add to all of this the microphone, front & back cameras (I got the Wi-Fi only model), accelerometer, GPS and compass and you now have a much more exciting tablet experience. I also found the Silk browser to be clunky and unresponsive at times on the Fire with tabs & buttons that are small and difficult to press , while iPad's Safari is easier to use and has not even hiccupped. Could it be my wireless router? The distance to the router has not changed, just the tablet, so I call that a Silk issue.\n\nSo what really changed between the Kindle Fire and the iPad? Me. I thought all I wanted was a good eBook reader and for the last couple of years, the Kindle more than sufficed. But I found out that my needs and expectations have changed and I what I really want now is great tablet. And that's the iPad, hands down.\n\nCorrection: The wi-fi only model does not have a GPS module, but the location services and digital compass can still show your location for apps that need it. Interestingly, turn-by-turn directions in Mapquest work fine, as long as you have a wifi signal, but unless you have a good wifi signal in your car, GPS is pretty useless."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Tablets are toys. Last year, I dropped cable and considered either buying a Mac Mini or iPad 2 w/ Apple TV 2 and hooking it up to my TV. I decided to go with the latter. Not the best move. If you want to buy content from Apple, it may work well for you. If not, you have to jump through hoops or put up with inferior quality. Netflix and Hulu are not as good on the iPad or Apple TV as they are on a computer.\n\nIn fact, I should have stayed away from the Apple line in my HTPC decision... It would have been smarter to get a nice, Sony laptop and one of the WiDi boxes that allow you to screen share your PC with your TV. (I hate the idea of plugging a computer into HDMI with a cable). Then, when you play music from your laptop to your TV (connected to a stereo), you can trip out on the visualizer. Apple TV 2 has no visualizer. It has no horsepower. It is the iPhone 4 processor packed into a hockey puck with some output jacks slapped on. (from a design perspective, it is well done. I do think Apple are still great with hardware).\n\nTablets are toys. For example, if you want to surf the web on the iPad, there is no Flash. Indeed, people make a much bigger deal about this than it is, as most big websites offer the same content as h. 264 video. However, you will run into a few that only use Flash. You can use Photon, but it is not that great. It is true that Flash on mobile devices, even Android, is not very good. See? Tablets are toys!\n\nThe really bad thing is that Safari does not support the file upload html input element, so you cannot upload photos to sites like Ebay or Facebook. You need to use their apps. Why? Because iOS does not let you get into the directory structure. It is a toy. A consumer product. It is not cheap either.\n\nLike I said, I should have just got a nice Windows 7 laptop and WiDi, which would have been better than a Mac Mini and a remote keyboard. The laptop can go anywhere and can be used without the TV. Why not get a Macbook and Apple TV 2 and use AirPlay? Because it does not support screen mirroring! I think there are third party solutions, like AirPlay Server (not made by Apple). But we know why they do this. If it doesn't fit into the Apple ecosystem, they don't want to put in much effort to support it. After all, if they did that, you might watch Hulu instead of paying for shows on iTunes. I shudder to think that Apple is rumored to be interested in aquiring Netflix and Hulu. If they do, say goodbye to affordable programming...\n\nOh, and if you want to buy a show or movie on Amazon and watch it on your TV with the Apple ecosystem, good luck. It is nit really possible with the iPad 2 or Apple TV 2, and if you do it on the Mac, you either need to plug into your TV, or maybe try the third party AirPlay screen sharing software, if it still exists or is any good...\n\nThe Intel WiDi system, with devices made by a few manufacturers, had 1080p for years before the new Apple TV 2 did. If you project Hulu or Netflix, full screen, onto your TV, it is 16:9 widescreen, etc. It is simlly a better HTPC setup than I can think of! Total buyers remorse. I will have to put up with this iCrap for a few years, until it is totally obsolete...\n\nMy Apple fanboy days are over. Everything I own is Apple, and I see more and more bugs and more creepy \"lock you in\" behavior every day. Look, I am not going to pay $4 to rent a movie or $1-4 to buy TV episodes. Even though I watch maybe an hour or so of video programming a day, I would end up spending $100+. I may as well have cable.\n\nWith the new Apple iBooks scandal, we can all see the writing on the wall. I also see Apple products, even the Mac, becoming less computers and more consumer toys. I bought my first Mac because I am a developer and needed a POSIX environment. Many times I wish I just got a decent Windows laptop and dual booted Ubuntu and Windows 7.\n\nApple quality has gone downhill bigtime recently. The new updates to Apple TV have it crashing quite often.\n\nTo make a long story short, if you want to buy content from Apple, an iPad may be fine. But if you want Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, you should look elsewhere. What? The iPad has Netflix and Hulu and Apple TV has Netflix built in? Yes. But they are not as good as the computer versions. To watch Hulu on your TV, you have to do a convoluted process, to get it to work somewhat well:\n\n1. Close all the apps on your iPad\n2. Shut down your iPad\n3. Restart Apple TV\n4. Start your iPad\n5. Turn on screen sharing\n6. Start Hulu\n\nThe closing apps and restarting the iPad was recommended to me by Hulu support, but restarting the Apple TV 2 seems to help a lot too. See? This is worse than Windows! Remember when Apple products didn't need to be rebooted comstantly to work?\n\nThat will get you Hulu on your TV, but it is  4:3 with content cut off. The video is jerky and (appearantly due to legal reasons) they can only have a 15 second buffer size, unlike the Flash based version.\n\nI will say that the iPad 2 with Apple TV 2 can do some amazing things. A game like Metalstorm, played via AirPlay mirroring has a cool feature, where the iPad becomes a virtual cockpit (it is the game controller) and the game is on the screen. Indeed, an iPad with its gyroscope and acclerometer is a great gaming controller and gaming device.\n\nThat said, if you like stuff like World of Warcraft, you are better off with a Windows laptop. iOS is a great gaming platform, but I think Windows still has an edge for deeper games.\n\nI am not a gamer. This was meant to replace cable TV, and does not do the best job. I was warned. I read a review in some tech mag that said the same thing... But I figured between Netflix, Hulu and the AirPlay feature, I had all my bases covered. Yes, but it is not a quality experience. It is often tears before bedtime.\n\nIf you want a consumer gadget toy kind of thing, the iPad is fine. Probably better than any other tablet out there. But I now think tablets are a fad. The press claims they are the future. People tend to settle for less, if told it is hot stuff. Look at Twitter, or the fact that most of us listen to music that has lesser audio quality than a CD (which doesn't sound as good as vinyl!). Heck, I settled for 720p for this setup. I could have spent the same amount of money, got a quality laptop (like a Sony, forgetabout Dell and HP), and a WiDi box, and had a way better experience... Along with having a real computer that I could use independent of my TV -- something with a real web browser, real applications... I gotta say, even Safari on a Mac is pretty bad. The app looks nice, but web pages are often poorly formatted and there is a bug that prevents me from using my bank's website!\n\nSee what I mean? Apple used to be the one that had quality. I think they have become arrogant and are resting on their laurels. Additionally, the influx of lame consumers combined with \"democratic design\" has them spending more time on Twitter integration than develping a decent mobile browser that can do something as basic as upload a file! Forget about Flash! These things can't even upload files! How can they? You have NO ACCESS to the file system. Even then, they could let you access the photo roll, but they were too busy setting up iCloud so they could gouge you, and putting in system wide Twitter integration for the iSheep idiots.\n\nI used to get annoyed when the Phandroids and Apple haters called these iToys and the users iSheep. But there is a lot of truth to that.\n\nI bought my iPad 2 about 10 months ago, and I have buyer's remorse. I had way too much faith in Apple. Keep in mind, they want you to buy their content. They are not going to bend over backwards to create a decent Hulu or Netflix experience. Who knows? Maybe these are purposefully hobbled so you will get fed up and just buy the show from iTunes.\n\nBut iTunes is not great. I have a decent internet connection, and it takes 2 hours to download a 1 hour show. They do not stream. In my opinion, Apple is a terrible internet company. For example, you can't even watch the video, on Apple's website, about the new iPad on the iPad 2. I have tried to backup my iPad 2 for a month now, but their iCloud stuff is so dead slow, it fails after a few hours, and the progress bar says it will take 10 hours to back up -- just the basic backup!\n\nDON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! The iPad is the best tablet, but tablets are HYPED! You would be so much better off just getting a nice, small, quality laptop. Given the better integration of Windows 7 and WiDi for getting your stuff on the HDTV, I would even say, forget about getting a MacBook and Apple TV 2. Forget about a Mac Mini and a cumbersome remote keyboard. I have the worst Apple hangover right now! It just hit me how limited a lot of their stuff is... Their nice ecosystem can be done better, and with more options and choices. I'd rather play music from a Windows 7 laptop to my TV/stereo through a WiDi box, and get the visualizer and all that jazz...\n\nI used to really love Apple products, but they have lost their luster. I don't think products like the iPad 2, the new iPad, and Apple TV2 meet the needs of even most consumers. The fact that the Mac is slowly becoming a big iPad makes me wish I had opted for a Windows/Ubuntu system.\n\nDid I mention that after the iOS 5.1 release and the new Apple TV 2 update, AirPlay has crashed on me about 8 times. It probably would have crashed more, but I often just listen to the radio instead now. Pathetic, eh? Yep, Windows ain't lookin' so bad now!\n\nApple is becoming way too oriented to the average consumer. If you cut the cord (ditch cable) and go with Apple, you will pay as much, if not more for content, especially if you have a family. Don't buy an iPad 2 and an Apple TV 2 and expect Netflix and Hulu to work very well. This is no slam on either of those companies -- I think they rock! The best Netflix snd Hulu experiences are computer based (I have not tried Roku, Boxee, etc.)\n\nYou should not have to pay $4-5 to rent a movie, or $2-3 to buy a TV show. WTF? I don't want to watch that same episode of The Office more than once.\n\nJust like this iBooks scandal, it is clear that Apple is here to suck you dry. You were warned!"}

If you are considering a tablet this is definitely the model for you. Apple has put a lot of work into making iOS as easy and accessible to the masses as they can, and that makes for a very pleasant experience. The iPad is great for watching videos, listening to music and reading books. I use my iPad more than I use my computer! There are so literally millions of apps to try. So you might be wondering why I still think this second generation model is King over the newer model? Well the reason is simply the price. The current gen iPad has always been a bit pricey but since the latest one came out this \"outdated\" model has dropped significantly making this the time to get an iPad 2."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The pixel density on this tablet is good enough to get good smoothing of the font edges. Yet, the iOS doesn't do well here. In result, reading PDFs is impossible as it causes some serious strain on my eyes. I have 20\" LCD HP crap that has ~3 less pixel density. Yet, the font edges are as good as on this IPAD. Huh.\n\nI see IPAD3 fixes this problem, but not in the iOS but with better screen - good for marketing since not many people even see any difference. In fact, people say the screen is not worth it. Huh. Makes me think if I got the eagle eyes or maybe there is a few million people who simply don't know nothing.\n\nIf you don't need PDF, well, letters in Safari are terrible too.\n\nAlso, I cannot believe there is no LED behind the Home button. There is even that dark square in it where LED could fit (like on HP touchpad). So, carrying it next to me, like iPhone, and checking email frequently is the way to go? That's ridiculous. If I am not using it, it's on the stand, not withing my reach. That's where LED comes handy.\n\nAlso, when I click on Mail icon that shows new email, it opens inbox, instead the email. - few clicks more are needed to see the email. Terrible approach if you plan to use multiple accounts and receive many emails.\n\nFinally, Notification bar is not popping-up new messages when I am working on ipad. Why? Status bar is there all the time - showing some small icon when new message arrives would be completely unobtrusive.\n\nIn summary, message/email communication interface is years behind Android. And yet, all that is needed are few minor changes.\n\nI was hopping that external adapter can serves as additional storage. At least read-only. But no, you can only import stuff from there. Import where? To 16GB memory? From HD camera? Ridiculous."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The iPad alone I would give 4-5 stars to.  Since there is no way to separate the service you get with this device, and the device itself (and once you get this particular model of iPad, you are most likely to be using AT&T (T-mobile is slower)), this device gets a really unfair rating from me.  Go look at the Verizon version.\n\nThe good:\nEasy to use, light, rugged.  Great apps.  The software and apps just \"seems to work\" as compared to the two Droid phones I've owned, which crash, do weird things, are sluggish when first turned on, etc. etc.  Based on this, I would not recommend an Android tablet to anyone except the most Technoholic Open Source types.\n\nThe bad: (blame AT&T, and spineless government oversight)\nI bought this because I would like to use it if I ever go overseas.  Since Verizon chose to go it alone with CDMA, and the regulators let them do that, you are stuck  in their little prison if you want to switch carriers.\n\n...So I was told by Apple that the data service would be easily turned on and off like a faucet, and that I would only have to pay for the months for which service was enabled.  Great!  I buy it in December, immediately use it \"off-campus\" in Albany on Christmas vacation (no internet at my Dad's if you can believe it...)\n\nSometime during Dec/Jan, I call AT&T to get them to help me figure out why I can not get in to the Settings->Cellular Data->My Account feature.  First call was probably 15-20 minutes long, and the AT&T representative is clueless.  It was like I was asking for help with my Acme Moon Lander.  I suspect it would have been news to the rep that AT&T actually has millions of iPad customers who pay them monthly.  In fact enough customers that AT&T should be able to escalate to iPad expert reps.\n\nCall two: Again 15-20 minutes, this time the rep is much more adamant that this must be an apple screen (though he could not explain why the AT&T death-star logo was on the screen I was having trouble with.)\n\nJust to play along, I call Apple, and waste some of their money and more of my time.  They quickly confirm this is not their problem.\n\nI finally figure out although it would be a nice-to-have to check my account out this way, I can go to their web site, and log in.  It takes me a surprisingly long time (about 20 minutes) to figure out how to \"suspend\" my service.  By this time, I've waited much too long, and I'm going to have to pay them for January, even though I had not used it then.\n\nOK, I pay my bills, and now I get a new bill for Mar 25 thru Apr 25.  Whot?  My service is suspended, why are they still billing me?\n\nNow the reason for the dud star: I call AT&T, and get Rep one.  They are very nice, and explain that even though I have suspended my service, I still have to pay.  What I really wanted to do is cancel my service.  Huh?  This is not sounding too much like a faucet anymore.  She suggests that what I REALLY want is what she calls \"Session based\" service.  She can not do that for me, but she will connect me with someone who will.\n\nI get put on hold where a recording LOUDLY tries to sell me a new Samsung tablet, repeatedly tells me I can  \"Re-think the Possible\" with AT&T.  Let me tell you, I've starting to rethink how badly customer service can possibly be at this time.  ....Oh yeah, and there is something in there about not wasting my time too.\n\nRep number two:  I recount my tale of woe,  but she will not have any of it.  First of all, I better get it straight: she does not know where this \"Session based\" phrase I'm throwing around came from, but I better get it straight.  Its called pre-paid, and we will hence-forth ONLY call it pre-paid, so we both know what we are talking about.  OK lady, you're the boss, Pre-paid.  How do I switch my account to Pre-paid, and how do I get this bill cancelled?  Well it turns out they can not just flip a software switch on their end.  The type of service (let's just call it a billing plan) is determined by my SIM card.  You've got that right: even though it is just a stupid serial number in a database, I've got to haul myself down to an Apple or AT&T store to get a new SIM card, so that they can bill me differently.\n\nApparently WAY back when, when I first signed up with AT&T (which I think I did on the phone because the web site was too confusing), THAT is when I went off the rails.  That is why my Settings->Cellular Data->My Account feature gives me a weird error which three different AT&T reps have not been able to help me with.  This woman was annoyed with me, and clearly thought it was all my fault for getting myself in to this predicament.  ....But she could not give me help with my bill.  Onward:\n\nMore annoying \"commercials\":  you know if this Rep loudly read the scripts from these commercials while we waited for the next rep, it would be considered really rude, and nobody would put up with it.  Give me the elevator music please.  I am not calling AT$T because I've got money burning holes in all of my pockets to buy another tablet, I am calling because they are not billing me the way I was promised.\n\nRep number three: I again recount my tale of woe (more quickly this time, so I don't p*ss him off).  Since I'm now in to minute 30 of this call, and that last rep was really testy with me, I'm now asking them to forgive three months for service not consumed.\n\nGuess what?  I tell this guy I apparently should have signed myself up for Pre-paid service way back when, and that is why I am here now, and he says: \"Oh you mean Session-based service?\", and proceeds to use the \"Session-based\" term that Rep #2 reprimanded me about for the rest of the conversation.\n\nSo AT&T: you are just awful.  When I communicate with you, you use the term \"Phone Number\" when it is not a phone. And I can not make phone calls (or text as far as I know)  You allow me to suspend my service, but you still charge me the same money, whats that all about?  Your own people disagree on what terms should be used for the billing plans.  And we are not talking innocuous terms like \"pop\" vs. \"Soda\", because this is how I got in to this mess.  I signed up for the wrong service, and I suspect it is because your poor discipline with terminology.  And that original error message, why give me a mis-leading error, just put up a screen which say \"You have got a XXX plan, and this info is not available under that plan\".  Cancel/Suspend, Pre-Paid/Session-based. Phone Number/device number.  \"Invalid account\"/Wrong plan type.  Pathetic. And I mean pathetic, not ludicrous, or shameful, or awful.  Pathetic."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "So I got my iPad 2 the first Friday of summer 2011, and have been loving it ever since. I use it for school (I'm practically paperless) and for entertainment. I got the 32 gigabyte model because I store a lot of apps, music, and pictures (from memebase, damn memebase.) With out further ado, here is my full review.\n\nHardware: the hardware for the iPad is great. The aluminum body is sleek, strong, and stylish. I feel very confident in the Apple build quality to withstand most of the things I do. The plastic on the iPad is very little, and still strong. It has your usual 30 pin port on the bottom, which is huge and I don't see why they don't make a smaller one. If you liked charging your iDevice with your computer, tough luck. Only a new MacBook Pro or a new iMac can charge the iPad 2.  I have neither. All in all, I give the hardware an A+.\n\nCases: A case is needed, however. My case is leather, and I got it for the magnetic closure, but for my use, it just isn't sturdy enough. Right now. I'm using&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/rooCASE-Dual-Station-Premium-Leather-Magenta-Case-Cover-with-Stand-for-Apple-iPad-2-iPad-3-The-new-iPad/dp/B004S4APTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">rooCASE Dual Station Premium Leather (Magenta) Case Cover with Stand for Apple iPad 2 / iPad 3 / The new iPad</a>&nbsp;in red; I couldn't find the red one in the product link section. With out a case or with a poor case, the corners will get pretty scuffed up and ugly. Also, on mine, the black plastic color part is kind of peeling. It's not that bad, though. Mind you that i'm a student, so I might do more things than you do. I recommend you get the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Speck-Products-CandyShell-Wrap-for-iPad-2-DarkLord-Black-SPK-A0418/dp/B004SGSH4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Speck Products CandyShell Wrap for iPad 2 - DarkLord Black (SPK-A0418)</a>. I just ordered it from Amazon $20 cheaper than from the Speck site.\n\niOS 5: I am at iOS 5.0.1, and for some reason, my iPad won't let me upgrade to 5.1. There isn't a huge difference, so don't feel like you are missing out.  The iOS is great. Everything is smooth, and the Internet browsing is great with the tabs. You can even split the keyboard in two and type with your thumbs, which is,neat, but not useful until you really learn how to use it. iCloud is also great. Every app I download on my iPhone gets downloaded on my iPad, and vice versa. Really useful. Still no freaking flash, though. There is an app you can download called Photon flash web browser, which lets you run flash programs. Really great for watching FLASH videos, if you know what I mean. I HAD TO! I HAD TO! I'm sorry. That was the dumbest thing ever, but you get what I mean. I rate the OS an A-\n\nBattery: I love the battery life, and at school, if I don't use it a lot, I can use it for another day. It has by far the best battery life of any LCD screen device I have. 'nuff said, A+\n\nSpeed: the iPad is super quick with its A5 processor, running apps like a charm and browsing the Internet sometimes faster than my laptop. Hell. It is  probably is faster than my laptop. If you want something fast, it's definitely something to consider. A+\n\nWeight: not too heavy, but not too light either. Feels perfect. It fits in my booksack, so it's good for me. A\n\nOne thing that makes me rate it 4 stars is the AirPrint or whatever Apple calls it. (my iPad recognized the word and spellchecked it, so I think I that's right) It's complete crap. There are only a select few printers that it can print to, and you have to jailbreak if you want otherwise. It's so dumb, and I print things a lot. I truly hate it. I am soon going to buy the network printing app on Cydia, so that will soon be gone, but still. Bad choice, Apple.\n\nAll in all, I rate the iPad 2 an A. If you want to save some money, buy the iPad 2 instead of the new iPad, but if it's your starting model and you don't care about the price, go with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Apple-iPad-MD328LL-A-16GB-Wi-Fi-White-NEWEST-MODEL/dp/B00746MXF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Apple iPad MD328LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, White) NEWEST MODEL</a>. The only reason to but this one is if you are price-conscious and the new iPad is too much for you. The iPad 2 is still great,but the display on the new one and the better proccessor make it a better buy."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "As someone who loves gadgets and still rebels against getting the latest thing, the iPad 2 at a reduced $399 was the route I took when the new iPad came out last week. After converting to an iPhone and iMac last year, it seemed the logical next step.\n\nThe true selling point is its portability. In bed, on the couch in front of the TV, and definitely for traveling-- this is a great accessory for checking email, Facebook, and browsing the web. The interface is simple and the display is great.\n\nThe cons are minimal. As an e-reader, the backlit display is hard on the eyes, so I find myself going back to my Kindle with its e-ink screen. And I find myself reminded that the iPad is probably closer to an iPhone than a computer because it limits some of the videos you may want to see since there is no way to get the Flash Player plug-in, which so many sites require. YouTube and Netflix, however, work just fine.  Although it was a bit frustrating when I paid for in flight wifi on a plane yesterday and still could not properly load a Netflix video.\n\nOverall, though, the iPad does exactly what it says it will do, which is giving the user a computer experience more personal and portable than a laptop. I have photos on it to share with others, church materials, kids books and games, magazines like People and Reader's Digest, and the all important Facebook app.\n\nIt is more of a toy than a necessity, but what a fun toy it is!"}

My only regret is I wish I would've gotten the 32gb model instead of the 16gb because your space will be eaten up fast.  All I'm saying is if you're on the fence about one go ahead and take a dive.  I use mine for browsing, reading comics, watching Hulu, occasional games, listening to music and reading books.  Sometimes I have to put it down just to take in the world around me.  Originally I had a Samsung Galaxy Tablet and while I enjoyed it, I made the switch to the Ipad for the overwhelming amount of applications.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "This review is for the general public looking for something easy and fun to use. I am not a techie and have never owned a tablet until yesterday when I purchased a Galaxy Tablet 10.1. I loved this tablet but sadly had to return it this morning when I learned that I was lied too about its ability to connect with a VGA projector. After returning the Galaxy Tablet 10.1 this morning because of its inability to connect to a VGA output I found myself reluctantly purchasing an i-pad 2 16gb tablet. I wish I had never returned the Galaxy Tablet 10.1!! In terms of usability the Samsung Galaxy Tablet 10.1 was super easy and within minutes I was sending off emails using voice control, etc... however the I-Pad 2 left me flustered all afternoon long and I am still in shock at how complicated and convoluted getting things to work on it is. For instance 1) Before I could download anything needed for work I had to up-grade the OS! 2) Once OS-5 was installed I bought three (3) apps - keynote, pages, some PDF reader and I also installed Netflix for free. I had to uninstall and then re-install all four (4) app's in order to get them to work properly! Then, it turns out that the i-pad 2 doesn't actually charge whilst plugged into the computer via its usb port?! The battery life is not ten hours either! After five hours of feverishly trying to figure this thing out I was way below 30% battery life! I found the applications very frustrating to access and EVERYTHING forces you to use APPLE \"something or another...\" be it music, files, pictures, etc... if you like having options than avoid the i-pad... it leaves you feeling like you have been run over after all of the new accounts you have to set up just to get it to turn on properly out of the box.\n\nCompared to the Galaxy Tablet 10.1, everything was super easy to use and ready to go. It also comes with Polaris Office which is just as nice as keynote and pages in my opinion and it is FREE! I wrote a review about the Galaxy Tablet 10.1 expressing my disappointment that Samsung is being so short sighted about not having an VGA adapter for it. However, I could find no fault with the tablet itself or its applications. It left me feeling upset that I had to return it as I loved it so much. However, the Apple i-pad has left me so angry after hours of jerking me around that I can't wait to bring it back tomorrow and be rid of it. I also have the arduous task of trying to get my money back for the apps keynote and pages... both $10.00 each. I will confess that now that everything is finally set up and once you succumb to Apple's monopoly over how software is transferred from your computer to the tablet (i-tunes - sigh!) both keynote and pages preserve your Microsoft word and PowerPoint documents very nicely and is usable immediately. The Apple i-pad also has a proper VGA adapter for its i-pad... but it is NOT as user friendly as people or Apple itself makes it out to be and has left me wanting to return it regardless. Also, unlike the Galaxy Tablet, it does not allow you to swipe the screen from left to right and limits you to the basic top to bottom functions. The keyboard is inferior to the Galaxy tablet as well. For whatever reason the i-pad doesn't even have a tab key despite the fact that there is a blank space where the tab key usually is on any normal keyboard, including the Galaxy tablet 10.1! Just to type in some of my passwords I have to literally change the keyboard options three (3) times! This is only a problem for people like me who actually make full use of all the keys on a qwerty key board when making passwords and such. The Galaxy Tablet keyboard was simple and easy to use. It was as good as typing on a laptop keyboard! I also found some really great books for free via the Galaxy whereas most of the free books for the i-pad is just crap. Apple should spend more time on perfecting its products instead of introducing new ones every six months!\n\nBottom Line: if you do not need to use VGA projectors than buy the Galaxy Tablet 10.1. I am heartbroken that I could not have kept that one. Leave Apple to those who like it for what it is. Personally, I'd sooner use a Remington Typewriter than the i-pad!\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI returned this iPad and purchased the Galaxy 10.1 Tablet again and couldn't be happier! I found a way around the projector problem too which is great. My only regret is having bothered to purchase the iPad at all."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Apple released one of the most amazing products on March 2 of 2011 called the iPad 2, and it is one of the most innovating and exciting tablets to hit the market. This aluminum body tablet is 9.7 inches weighing 1.3 pounds making it one of the lightest tablets on the market today, also having an A5 dual chip processor and a 720p retina screen display. It comes in three sizes, 16,32 and 64 depending on your downloading and previous photos, videos and music you can choose which one will better suit you. This tablet is a must buy if you're a traveler or you want a cool gadget to play games, listen to music, take photos and view all your social networks. Not to mention its great battery life when your on the go except for when your watching movies. The layout on the device is very structured so if you're a user that has an android phone then you probably won't like the feel that the iPad gives out. If you're an apple fanatic like myself who has all apple products then this will be another great add on to the collection.\n\n  Working at BestBuy you have the exciting job to know all the truth behind products as well as being able to get them a little early, nevertheless I must say that this was worth the buy. For the average man it will cost you 500 dollars, 543.11 to be exact when you pay NYS tax but like I said it's worth the buy. Launching the iPad was a great idea, with this device you can take notes and organize your daily tasks and if you just want a device to use to play thousands of games (many which are free) then this is a great buy. Personally carrying a MacBook pro to school each and everyday puts a toll on your back, so the iPad is a easier way to have a device which can do most of the things your computer can do, it is called an accessory to a MacBook\n\n  Personally this has to be one of greatest products out there I remember when I first bought it and synced it using iCloud to my other apple devices. Apple has always had a classy start up screen, so all you see in BOLD letters is \"Welcome\" following \"IPAD 2\" in an artistic but simple manner. I take it with me to school every time so I can take my notes and search the web, not to mention going on twitter or Facebook while class isn't in session. Its your everyday \"Big cellphone\" you cant help but take pictures on it, or add music it to and buy dozens of cases as if it were on of your new cellphones.\n\n The only thing that might bother a user is that it doesn't support Adobe Flash player. Many people can't stand that because they love to watch movies and video clips and the iPad doesn't support it, that is the biggest upset with the iPad. With the iPad you have the option of accessing the Internet via Wi-Fi or threw a hotspot, which is convenient for the user making it easy to tap into the World Wide Web.\n\n Overall if this device is in your budget you should get one, preferably a black one, the white one gets pretty dirty (I have one). If you are buying the iPad make sure you also include a protection plan because if you accidently drop it (since your going to be having a world of fun) the screen will crack, it is made up of glass.  Enjoy!"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Product Review: Apple iPad 2\n I would like to begin by saying I do not work for Apple nor do I know anyone who does. This review is my total honest opinion on the Apple iPad 2. I have no connection to Apple and this is my honest experience with the item. Advertisements and commercials for products are always circulating twenty four-seven. This also applied to the iPad 2. I had not paid much attention to the advertisements as I was satisfied with my iPad though at the moment, and had no need for the device.\nOne day while at home, my iPad fell out of my hands and was destroyed. I thought maybe to buy a new iPad but then the idea off an iPad 2 came to mind. The iPad 2 was released on March of 2011. I had seen so many commercials and heard so much about it. So the next day I got my little piggy bank, emptied it out and had about $28. Yeah, there was not too much money in my little piggy.\nI got the rest of the money from my parents, and the next day went to the closest Best Buy and bought a 16GB iPad 2 black tablet for the price of $499.99.  I also bought the 1 year accidental protection plan for $99.99, knowing my clumsy hands and bad luck. So I had spent around $600.00 on a single item. So this Apple iPad 2 I had gotten was supposed to be near perfect on the amount of money I had spent on it and way better then my iPad. Now the Apple iPad 2 was 7.3 x 9.5 x 0.3 inches in dimensions. The iPad 2 was really thin and really comfortable to hold.\nIt was also lighter then the iPad, not by too much but still a bit lighter. Now that I told you a little bit about the physical characteristics, let me tell you the new features that make this item unique. Apple doubled the RAM in iPad 2 from around 256MB to 512 MB. This will help process graphics for games and help deliver images faster. The two cameras is also a better feature over the old iPad, one in the front facing you and one in the back. Now these cameras aren't anything special. Their digital effect is just alright and the pictures will not come out too crisp or clear. The cameras do help with video chatting and FaceTime.\nOne of the biggest disappointments I had with my iPad was that it was never available to multi task. The iPad 2 increased RAM allows more applications to be open at once. Now these applications are available in the app store. There are close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps that work on the iPad 2. There are also Google Books, iBook, Nook, Kindle for readers on the iPad 2. I can use all these apps all day long because of the battery life.\nThe iPad 2 battery last over 10 hours constantly on. The need to recharge battery constantly is not necessary. Now as great as the iPad 2 is with all these qualities, every coin has two sides, this applies to iPad 2. There are several things still needing improvement on the iPad 2. There is no USB support for mass storage. There is also still no dedicated SD card slot. For example, if I wanted to put pictures onto the iPad from my camera, I would need an adapter.\nAnother distinguishing flaw in the iPad 2 is the lack of flash support. There are many programs that require the iPad 2 to run on Adobe Flash. The Android tablet on the other hand does allow Flash support. The iPad 2 is a great and impressive tablet that can be purchased in the market today. The iPad 2 is probably the best on the market at the moment. The iPad 2 isn't perfect and the price may be a bit high but if you can afford it, I would recommend it for you."}

I am so glad that I ordered the Verizon version. The data package deals are not too bad and can be purchased directly from the iPad. The apps are super fun and the apps that I will use for my kids are not that expensive, between 2 and 5 dollars. A note to self would be that IBM Lotus notes is not immediately compatible with Mac.

He heard about Apple's new iPad and wanted me to give him some ideas of what techies thought of Apple's retina display in the new iPad. So I went to a website I read frequently and one that is popular with the most technologically literate people on earth: tomshardware dotcom. I am including\nsome of the comments voted highest and left by tomshardware frequent readers. It is hoped that this will assist\nintelligent readers on deciding if they should get the new iPad.\n\nHalcyon:\n\n\"Why didn't someone besides Apple use this most excellent screen first? Heck, Samsung makes the screen...you'd think they put something as nice in their own tablets.\"\n\n------\nBystander:\n\nFrankly, I find it a little ridiculous at the resolution of this screen. I'd rather have the extra battery life and if you use it for games, they are probably going to have to use it at half the resolution for performance reasons.\n\n2550x1600 on a 30\" is about as crisp as i can see. Why do we need that on a 9.7\" screen?\n\nI won't refuse the added resolution, but I'm not sure there is much reason to spend extra money for it either.\n\n------\n\nIcemunk quoted by Del35:\n\n\"Back in 2010 when Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone 4, he claimed that the human eye stooped discerning the individual pixels when the pixel density is 300ppi. Hence he called the display on the iPhone 4 the retina display, which has 326ppi. Now we go forward in time almost two years and after all the human eye stops discerning pixels at 260ppi not 300ppi as previously stated.\n\nAlso the phone I mentioned was a Nokia N900, at the time I also had a iPhone 3GS and a Xperia X1. Without knowing I had two phones with retina displays.\"\n\nThe retina display is such a load of nonsense. The hype is designed to draw technologically subliterate zombies. The bottom line is that I simply can't imagine using a device like the new iPad that prevents me from experiencing fully close to 30% of websites due to its proprietary infestation (no flash and no java support!). On another note, I am happy that Samsung manufactures the retina display for Apple. Obviously they see no need to create a hype around it and seem not to be pushing it on their devices. For me the 1280 x 800 Pixel Super Amoled display of the the Samsung Galaxy Note is more than I need. Thanks but no thanks Apple. Give me connectivity, openness, and produce a device with a better that 2 in 10 repairability ratio and thus almost impossible to repair, also throw in a micro sd slot and price the device reasonably and I might consider it. Till you do that you will just be producing overpriced junk for  zombied morons using your logo as a shield.\n\nEnd of story.\n\n-----\nIcemunk:\n\n\"Fact of the matter is Apple displays are nice, and set a good benchmark, however they have been surpassed by newer technologies and better resolutions on many fronts. Most new super phones surpass 300ppi using LCD, OLED, and LED technologies.\"\n\n-----\nIcemunk:\n\n\"Yup, Samsung make excellent handheld displays!\n\n----------\n\nVladislaus:\n\n\"My old phone with 3,5 inch 800x480 apparently also has a retina display long before Apple introduced it with the iPhone 4. Apparently all of a sudden, retina displays became much more common overnight.\"\n\n----------\n\nThe Dane:\n\n\"Apple's retina displays still uses IPS panels. Much prefer lower resoution SuperAMO LED if image quality is important.\"\n\n--------\n\nIcemunk:\n\n\" There are plenty of phones with \"Retina\" display (above 300 ppi). For example, the Samsung Galaxy Nexus has a 4.65\" OLED screen with 316 ppi, however it is not advertised as \"Retina\" display, because that is a marketing gimick which Apple has a copyright for. OLED beats LCD hands down by the way.\"\n-------\n\nShaod:\n\n\"Of course it has 316 ppi \"strictly speaking\" - ppi being simply the number of pixels it has per inch. That's ignoring that PenTile actually looks (subjectively) better than a regular display of the same resolution, while using less power because it has few subpixels.\n\nAnd sorry but 'retina display' is a marketing term. Like you point out it is completely subjective upon other factors such as where the screen is held and how good the eyesight of the user is.\"\n-------\n\nIcemunk responds to Watcha who  seems to work for Apple:\n\n\"You sound like a person who has little experience outside his Iphone and Apple products.. that is unfortunate, I believe you are caught up in the marketing of Apple and confusing it with science. It's tough to be a truly critical thinker when you are a fan boy unfortunately... hopefully you'll realize this in time. Good luck.\"\n-----\n\nIcemunk responds to Apple employee Watcha:\n\n\"I'm not going to argue about what a \"Retina\" display is, because that is a marketing device which Apple holds copyright. If you would like to argue facts, than I will present them to you:\n\nOLED is a superior display. Lower power, higher clairty, better viewing angles, true blacks and superior contrasts, higher resolutions, more advanced, higher quality, vibrant colors. LCD does not compare, even if you make up some marketing term about \"Retina\" display. OLED wins hands down, no matter how you spin it. And just so you know.. Apple won't be using LCD in their next Iphone, Samsung will make them a nice OLED display for it instead.\"\n\nDel35 replies to Icemunk:\n\n-------\n\n\"Watcha is unforuntetly lacking in real knowledge, and lost in the vast marketing machine produced by Apple. He reads his \"science\" from websites such as[...] which talks about nothing but Apple.. I feel for people like him, they don't realize they are being manipulated by marketing.\"\n\nI agree. In fact Watcha is even lacking in the basics of logical reasoning as evidenced by many of his past comments. Watcha does not even know  what  a contrapositve statement is or what a converse statement is or what  a tautology is. To illustrate his total lack of logical skills,  I recall a discussion with Watcha where he/she claimed that Apple made better product because more affluent people purchased them. I replied to him that his argument was akin to the claim that slavery was a better economic system because wealthier people held slaves in the 17th and 18th Century. He could not see the fallacy of his claim and held to it. Now it is known that Watcha works for Apple. So he is just working to put food on his table albeit in an immoral and anti-intellectual  fashion.\n\n--------\n\nIcemunk:\n\n\"I'm not going to argue about what a \"Retina\" display is, because that is a marketing device which Apple holds copyright.

I think people who have read this far can make an intelligent decision on whether they should buy the hyped \"Retina Display\"."}

Its extremely fast and lightweight along with a long lasting battery life which I enjoy. Works perfect for students like myself and in the business field for my job and can finish normally huge assignments and projects in minutes. For $499 you get everything you pay for. The only con is I wish it had a flash player since it won't play certain videos. The ipad 2 is a must buy for any skeptics out there!!!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I've been using the iPad 2 for about 8 months after using the first generation iPad for a year.  The iPad 2 is sleeker, much thinner and lighter.  These are big differences if you plan on doing a lot of reading on the device and need to hold it for extended periods of time.  The camera is a nice-to-have addition.  The iPhone 4 has a better camera and is easier to use when taking pictures - the iPad is a bit bulky to use as a camera.  Also, for me, cellular connectivity is a must since I travel frequently and can't always rely on a WiFi signal.  Cellular data plans are about $25/month, so if you don't need it, you can save a fair bit of money.  I might still recommend getting the device with the cellular antenna - you can enable it when you need it and cancel data plans when you don't.  Lastly, the question of white or black face... while white is a new option with iPad 2, I actually find the black frame preferable, especially when viewing video content."}

I'm a veteran who is a professional artist and student attending college.\nMy VA counselor chose it for me because she thought it would be beneficial for me to show my work on to potential employers.\nI read a few reviews on it before hand, and I was already not thrilled about the non-USB support.\nAfter I opened everything up, I noticed there was no quick installation guide or anything telling me what goes with what and so forth. I'm more of a PC person, and my knowledge of Macs are basic, but I was able to figure things out.\n\nThe apps that they say are free, are not really free. They ask for your credit card number at the app store.\nAbout all I can do with this thing is load my pics and music on it. It doesn't even come with a head phone jack.\nIt does not recognize the Blue toothe wireless keyboard that came with it.\nAll the content that you load must be loaded through Itunes.\n\nThere is also no Flash support. I don't like the virtual keyboard.\n\nIf I want to browse the Internet, and use email, I prefer to use my laptop.\nAlthough my laptop is much heavier, I see no real replacement for it when it comes to showing off my work on the spot. I am actually more impressed with the Kindle Tablet than I am with the Ipad2.\n\nIn my opinion, the Ipad2 is cool for the average person, but for a professional artist like myself, its pretty lame.\n\nI need a device that I can load my motion graphic, video/film, and animation clips to, and be PDF compatible.\nI'm really disappointed with this product, as it does not meet my personal or professional needs."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "My wife just bought an iPad 2 and I had the Transformer Prime (Android Platform).  I have researched for quite a long time before I bought my Prime (since returned) and actually had THREE Android tablets that all just did not cut it for me.  If you are on a lower budget, than certainly there are MANY Android tablets out there.  If you have the funds, I highly recommend the Apple iPad 2 as it is about the the best \"overall\" tablet out there.  Whether you like Apple or Steve Jobs history or politics, the iPad 2 really is a quality machine.  Nothing is perfect, and nothing will please everybody, but in comparing devices, I now have the experience with both platforms and will pick iPad as the best of the two.  For the average user, that being the non-technical, non-programmer type, and the person NOT looking for a tablet to replace a PC or laptop, the iPad 2 is a wonder.  Yes, it sure has different operating system and is \"closed\" compared to Android.  Yes, it does not support Java or Flash, but these are small issues. If you MUST have Java or Flash, or \"hate\" Apple, then no matter what anybody says, you will not like any reviews of the iPad 2.  If you are a regular \"Joe\" or \"Janet\", then read carefully all of the reviews and see that the iPad is a great unit if you can afford the extra dollars.  In a few weeks, the iPad 3 is likely announced and the prices for the remaining iPad 2's will likely decreases.  When that happens grab one immediately.  Of course, if you have the money, might want to consider the iPad 3.  People seem to get personal about an Apple product, either love them or hate them.  I have no bias, I own an Android Phone and will likely keep it.  I own an Ipod Touch and will probably keep it.  Since I have an Ipod and have had one for years (since they came out) I am familiar with iTunes and the iTunes Store.  If you are one of these people, you will find the interface of the iPad 2 familiar to you. Almost every application I used on the iPad 2 (my wifes) as compared to the Android devices was better.  Yahoo and SKYPE Video chat was far superior.  I did not use the camera on the iPad 2, but then again, a camera on a tablet is of NO importance to me.  Ease of use and quality are, and I choose (now) the iPad 2.  I simply like the Apple OS on a tablet better than Android. A huge difference I found with the iPad 2 over Android, is that with the default Android Sync program, I could not SEND an email from my exchange.  I could RECEIVE only.  After finding this out, and searching online, it is common issue and you need to download a third party SYNC program to accomplish this.  The iPad 2 works flawlessly out of the box sending and receiving exchange emails. I almost bought an iPad 2 in the beginning, and after three different Android units, am certainly going to purchase the iPad (2 or 3).  Things might just work out better anyway now, that a new iPad will be announced shortly.\n\n*****update: I did purchase an iPad 2 on March 7 after the price was lowered by $100. I can safely state again that this is a fabulous device and I highly recommend. If you want a quality built tablet that can do pretty much all you would need, see if you can pick up an iPad 2 32 or 64 gb one before they are all gone."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Ok, I can't say this item really needs a review, I think everyone pretty much knows the iPad is the master of the tablets.  I paid full price for my 64gb iPad and I don't regret it, even as long as it took me to save up for it.  I love getting digital copies of movies (like from the bluray discs you were already going to buy) and putting them on this bad boy to take wherever I want.  Not only can I enjoy it, but with an AV adapter cord I can plug it up to any HDTV and entertain everyone.\n\nObviously the apps are awesome.  There practically is an app for everything.  My biggest consideration in getting the iPad over an ereader was the amount of books you have access to.  On an iPad, you have access to all the iBooks, Kobo books, B&N nook books, and amazon kindle books through their own app.  Just recently I found one negative thing about having an iPad over a kindle.  I'm not talking about the fire either, because I really don't know enough about the fire to compare point for point, I'm just talking ebooks here.  The Kindle lets you borrow one book a month I believe it is for free (the kindle version ones that are listed as $0.00) if you are an amazon prime member.  Until recently, I wasn't a prime member and I wasn't disappointed until I found out that the iPad app for kindle doesn't offer the free borrowing of books unless you have an actual kindle. This may change some day if enough people complain, but as of right now, it isn't offered.  So if you are fine with paying for all of your books or you aren't willing to pay to be a prime member, then you have access to more books on an ipad.  Oh another cool thing is that you can download the overdrive app which you can rent digital books or audiobooks from your local library with your library card for free.  I love the audiobooks because I'm sure you know how expensive they are to buy, and unless I know for sure its a good book, I'm not willing to drop $20-$45 on an audiobook.\n\nAs for the internet on the iPad, browsing is a breeze, saving pages and bookmarking is a breeze.  The only thing is it does have some problems connecting to little mom and pop wif signals for some reason.  Its a known problem and I imagine the iPad3 will be better at this.  Other than that there are no complaints from me for the internet.\n\nPrinting from the iPad is so cool, too.  Even if you don't have an airprint printer, you can still find an app to print to almost any printer through wifi.  I haven't found one yet that I couldn't print on using Print Bureau.  Its really cool and after you figure out how to use it, its pretty simple too.  I can even print to my huge commercial printer/scanner/network fax machine at work.\n\nI also love the adapters for cameras that lets you easily plug and transfer pictures/video directly to the iPad to send or post somewhere online.\n\nIf you have an iPod or iPhone, the charger that comes with the iPad is much stronger, and charges your other apple idevices much faster than with the chargers that came with them.\nOverall very happy with my purchase!!!\n\nI wanted to add an update, my schoolwork is online and I did find a way around the adobe flash problem so that I can access all of my school assignments and take tests from my iPad.  It's like a Firefox app, at least it syncs with Firefox, but it is called mercury. No flash problems =)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Well, well, well, I finally bought an iPad. I was originally against it and bought the Asus Transformer first. It's not the greatest thing in the world, but the operating system and features are good in their own way. I might one day sell it and buy a Prime, since I like certain things about Android better. The main part that I don't like is the speed it operates at. (Lags a lot). But this is not about Android; it's about the iPad.\nOk, so the main reason that I was against the iPad and Apple products was it's use of slave children to make them and the exclusivity of the operating system. Slave children part? Still an issue. But the main reason I ended up buying one was the promise of Apple of making textbooks for college available on them. I had waited so long for it, too. How convenient is that? No more aching back and such. SSOOOOOOOO nice! And the exclusivity of the operating system? It's honestly not as bad as people had made it out to be. For the most part, things work really well in all aspects for the iPad and there's really only a few websites that I have gone to that don't play videos. I don't play flash games, so that's not an issue. But for reals, the iPad has the best apps and they're tailored specifically for it. The best example is Splashtop, which remotely accesses your computer. It certainly is NOT optimized for the Transformer. The greatest thing is that I can actually watch movies streamed from my computer in bed! When it comes to the processing power, I have been told that the components are the same for both of my tablets, but the iPad plays streaming video a whole lot better. And it also does just about everything better.....except for the widgets. Why can't Apple design widgets for the iPad??? That's why I like the operating system of Android better, plus you can customize it better and surf files better and generally get a more user-oriented experience. Once again though, the apps for iPad ARE better and there ARE more of them, (though not a whole lot). It quickly does hit a brick wall and the apps fall dramatically in quality. Most of the apps that are truly useful, you will find on both. Itunes though is a b*tch and I truly do not enjoy using it. This cuts back to the point I made that files are easier to work with on Android products. If you can climb successfully up the iTunes learning curve, you will do well, but you shouldn't enjoy it, if my experience is anything to go on. So, that's about all I have to rant about right now. If you're like me, you'll just blow your money and get an Apple product AND and Android product. Both good, but for now, the iPad is MUCH better. I swear, sometimes I just want to hold it and fall asleep with it. Oh, and just as a quick afterthought, the next generation of iPads need more quick-access buttons, just like Android. There should be a menu button, back button, (that doesn't just take you back to the main screen), and a quick-switch multitasking button. If they did this, the iPad would truly reign supreme. Thanks for a great product!"}

The top reason for iPad 2 over the readers is the viewing surface. Oh sure on a reader you can pick you r font. However you cannot pick your screen size.  As long as this is my reader of choice I though \"oh well why not make it the computer as well.\" So being familiar with the iphone there would be almost no learning curve.  I picked the max memory (not that I will use more than a fraction of it) just because if for some reason I wanted more in the future  I would not have to worry if it was upgradable or not. I intend to use the blazes out or this iPad 2 until the technology no longer exists. So far I have only used the Wi-Fi part as one little security password and it was actively accessing the net.  Will pick 3g if traveling is in my plans.  So far there are just too many free hot spots.

The current nano is like magic.  (see Clarke's Law).  I just don't like Apple and their holier than thou and more superior than thou attitude about their products and operating systems.  Our household just got an iPad against my better judgement.  Seems one of us drank the Koolaide.  And as I suspected that person was in for a rude awakening when it came to making the iPad work and play well with others (the rest of the world that is android and windows based) and don't get me started about not supporting Flash.  So if all your friends and family are using iPhones and iPads you will have no problem communicating with them ( well not really) .  Apple has a chip on their shoulder about not invented here.  They have proprietary apps and programs that only work and play well with same ( AirPrint, FaceTime, etc) .  Brother for instance makes one of the most popular and economical mono laser printers in he world and AirPrint does not work with it.  You have to buy an app to be able to print from iPad to Brother products. Fail. Speaking of buying things, you will have to buy the smart cover and you will probably want the back smart cover and an a longer power cord and then a carrying case.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I wanted a lightweight tablet to replace my laptop for school use, and after weighing my options, I decided on the iPad 2 over the Samsung Galaxy tab because Apples appstore is alot more disverse and expansive. With apps like Documents To Go Premium and AVPlayerHD, it has almost completely replaced my laptop, and with the keyboard/case combo I ordered it does word processing just fine. It does pretty well with the battery life at mid-level brightness and does terrific on the lowest setting. Im a college student and Im at school for 12 hours on some days, so time is factor and it delievers.\n\nMy one big issue with the iPad is its restrictions. You can not drag and drop items like word documents, images, pdf's, videos to and from the ipad without itunes, and because the iPad natively only plays a few video formats, you have to download an app if you want a broader selection. AVPlayerHD plays all video formats and actually allows you to drag these files into the sharing option in itunes. Which makes the device feel much more diverse, but the app isn't free, its about 1.99 in the appstore. Aside from the restriction issue I really like it, it hasn't completely replaced laptop, not until your able to transfer items without the use of iTunes.\n\n(There are apps like AVPlayerHD that allow you to transfer  certain incompatible files to your ipad through iTunes, and Im sure there are some for photos and documents, but you'll have to hunt for them down and they probably won't be free -but I guess if you can afford to shell out the dough for an iPad you can afford a couple 1 to 10 dollar apps-)\n\nI reccomend the iPad, its pretty cool.\n\n*Update*\n\nI got my iPad on Jan 14th, 2012 and got rid of it February 12th, 2012. It was very fun for awhile, but once the novelty wore off the iPad was just too limited. I needed more freedom and less hassle, I'm not a fan of going through iTunes for virtually all data transferring. I cant hook anything up to it without some ridiculous peripheral; something as simple as an SD or MicroSD card slot could have made a world of difference, my model was 16 gig. After the iOS 5 update it was down to about 13, and I had over 6 gigs for music and 8 for previous iPod touch apps.\n\nI had tons of movies but with the limited none expandable space, I could only fit about three compressed movies at a time, which were greatly smaller in size compared to anything offered in the iTunes store. I greatly regret not going with the Galaxy Tab, which in terms of flexibility is incredibly superior, however, neither of these are computers so the overall flexibility I prefer might never be on that level. That said, I probably should have gone with the Galaxy, although, the iPad was very fun, it wasn't for me."}

However, it's well worth the learning effort. After an initial slow, but fun orientation and adjustment period, she loves it. It's fun, attractive, and pretty funciontal. I found it was not good for doing my homework asssignments and heavy duty work, because of its small size and onscreen keyboard (not effecctive if you really know how to type). However, once we added a bluetooth keyboard, I thought that it really could be a good \"only\" computer for anyone but a hard core document writer. I certainly would consider it for myself, as a travel and meeting device, but I'm still not giving up the big comfortable screen on my desk in the office. One more important note.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Like most, I've been smitten by the iPad since it was released about two years ago. I couldn't justify purchasing it for the longest time because I couldn't figure out how to work it into my technology regime. It's not computer enough to replace my Macbook Pro, and it's not phone enough to replace my iPhone 4 (not the 4S) running 5.0.1. When you factor in the price, I just couldn't convince myself that the iPad was something I couldn't live without.\n\nThen the iPad 2 comes out: front- and rear-facing cameras were new, so I could use the iPad for face-timing my mom 14 hours away, but it was essentially still something halfway between a computer and an iPhone.\n\nFinally I came to a point where I could spare the $600+ dollars to purchase the cheapest iPad 2 capable of connecting to at&t's 3G wireless service. I ordered this iPad on January 18 and just received it yesterday, so keep in mind I've only had this thing for one day.\n\nImmediately, I can see how the iPad 2 may come off as seductive; essentially, it's a ginormous screen surrounded by a thin frame of black or white (depends on which color your purchase--I bought white) with a single button. There's no denying that it's sexy. When you turn it on (after plugging it into iTunes and completing the necessary setup) you're blown away by the crisp screen--though it's not yet on par with the Retina display of the iPhone 4 and 4S, it's a luscious screen and only the seasoned 'techie' would notice this slight inferiority. The iPad 2's screen is still better than most if not all its competition.\n\nApple also has a leg-up on its competition with the easy integration with iTunes. If your like me and you bought the iPad 2 to simply be what it is: an iPad, somewhere in between a computer and an iPhone--then you likely won't be filling your iPad 2's limited storage with your entire music library. I opted to sync with only my recently played music, top played music, recently added music, and a few recent playlist I've made, which I'll probably replace with newer playlists as they're made. I did sync with a fair amount of the same apps that I have on my iPhone, a handful of movies, none of my ringtones (what would I use them for?) and ended up using about 9GB of the 16GB available on the iPad 2 model I purchased. And in all actuality, after the firmware files and other junk Apple puts on their products, only about 13-14GB of the 16 are available to use out of the box.\n\nAs expected, web browsing and email are where the iPad 2 shines. It's very smooth, the screen shows side-screens and sub-menus simultaneously, which really makes this thing quick to use. I used a Best Buy gift card I received for Christmas to purchase Apple's aluminum wireless keyboard to connect to my iPad 2 via Bluetooth and, although the keyboard makes me occasionally reach over for a mouse (you must still use the touch-screen mechanism despite having an actual keyboard), typing is a DREAM on here now! Facebook is also very fun to use with the keyboard setup versus the onscreen keyboard or even using the Facebook app on my iPhone. Don't get me wrong, the onscreen keyboard of the iPad 2 is very usable, but I find with a screen as large as the iPad 2's, I'd prefer having an actual keyboard so as to utilize as much of the screen as possible for web browsing, emailing, Facebooking, and anything else.\n\nI wish Apple would make it more clear that for at&t 3G models, the SIM card is not included and will need to be purchased separately. I haven't gotten around to going to my local at&t store to pick one up, so I'm not too sure how much a SIM card will cost.\n\nAll things considered, so far I'd say I'm happy that I purchased the iPad 2. It's only receiving 4 of the 5 stars because, although I'm very comfortable with using it and definitely see myself using it on a daily basis, it hasn't replaced any of my other electronics. In all actuality, it's become another separate electronic device that I've incorporated into my routine for its own purposes. The 4 of 5 stars also reflects the price; I understand that you 'get what you pay for' (which is definitely the case for the iPad 2, as it outperforms the competition on every aspect except price), but for a product to ADD to your routine rather than to REPLACE or SIMPLIFY, I think the price could come down just slightly. Even a difference of $50 might be enough to lure in some hesitant customers."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "In November of 2011 I bought the Amazon Fire mostly because I wanted to stream their Prime movies.  The screen for movies and tv shows was fantastic though the wifi connection would keep dropping in the middle of streaming. The more I used the Fire the more I realized that it wasn't able to give me what I wanted.  It did not have a large enough amount of device itself storage space,I could not turn the backlight down low enough to make it comfortable for me to read, I could not download the BN reading app to read my BN book library, and the screen really wasn't large enough to comfortably browse the internet or read magazines.  I started looking at the Ipad 2 and after what I saw from a co-worker's IPAD I gifted my Fire to my sister and bought my own Ipad.  I absolutely love it!  It has given me everything that I wanted - most specifically the fact that I can have the Amazon reading apps and BN reading app on the device and can read both bookstore's library on the same device.  I had purchased the 16 mb but two days later upgraded to the 64 mb.  The backlight can be turned down to being almost off, browsing is great, reading my emails is easier now. The wifi connection is solid up in my room where the Fire would keep dropping the connection. I am amazed at how much you can do with this device with the different apps.  It is always with me!  True it is heavier than the Fire - it's more like reading a hardback book, but the print is big and the backlight is softer on the eyes.  Also true is the fact that I now cannot watch the Amazon Prime movies and tv shows, but ITunes has a lot to offer even though you have to pay for it.  Small trade-off in my opinion since I am mostly a book person - not a movie person.  Now if Amazon were to make a bigger Fire and take care of some of the issues I mentioned above - the Fire could definitely give the IPAD a run especially having the Instant Prime Video behind them but for now I would recommend the IPAD 2 over the Kindle Fire.  p.s.  My sister really likes the Fire and is very satisfied with it."}

BUY A Keyboard! Mac Bluetooth.\n\nThen it was the infatuation with \"apps!\" \" GOLLY look at this! It allows me to print a document!!\"  And other absurdities like that.\n\nYou know? The stuff that we all have been doing well now for 10 plus years, with the buggy nightmares of the 90s, that used to make one pull hair out in Windows' frustration, now thankfully long suppressed... .\n\nI used to refer to Mac devotees as \"Mac Bigots!\"\n\nBut after dealing with Windows security issues, and instability through every Windows generation... I finally took the plunge with a Powerbook and never looked back. If I became less than a \"Mac Bigot,\" still I learned to love Apple's integration,  stability, sleek looks and creative tides... that happily washed over Apple's countrymen and America as a whole, like that great wave from the first iPhone.\n\nBut, this is an iPad review and although I don't desire to denigrate this generally great piece of technology or even review it seriously, I  do want to you to seriously consider a Macbook Air before the iPad.\n\nWeight is a great part of the allure of the lightweight iPad...but... the new Macbook Air is only about twice as heavy and since it may be likely that the first thing you may buy is a Bluetooth keyboard... that may not be a deciding issue...because if you wish for your, oh so cool... purchase to actually be a functional input device of text... and you took touch-typing in high school... the plunking at an iPhone or iPad's screen... with one's THUMBS... or the dull end of your fingers... becomes a tedious devolution of functionality.\n\nAnd this is the real core of my criticism of PADS in general. They are at this point clever receivers of information but clunky input...ers. One looks for app after app to do the simplest things...  and then we say... \"golly isn't that cool,  I can actually highlight text!\"\n\nAnd guess what? That highlighting of text usually takes a few tries to get the text that you actually need to select with \"TAPS\" selected...to 'mark-up' a doc properly... and some compromise is usually entailed and could have been far more exactly... achieved with a mouse 30 seconds ago.\n\nLook ... do I like my iPad?\nYes!\n\nAnd I did  order a stylus for 27 bucks and it has not come yet so I can't comment upon that helpful addition as a partial solution for... the iPad's entry flaws... .  But realize... when one peals away the COOL... and gets to the functional daily needs of email ... and entry of certain data... you will spend a good deal of your iPad time... which after all... is life time... learning to get around.. the touch screen and the operating system\"s... limitations.\n\nNow ... it is true that if one has say...an iMac which I Highly recommend ... that the real question is: how much...do you actually  need to input at the coffee shop or as a quick reference in the car or as a very light travel basic communication computing device? If the answer is \"not really that much...\" or if putting up with the iPad's limitations for real text entry is OK on occasion... and the added weight of a keyboard is only needed part time... then it has indeed a LOT of very cool qualities and... apps too... that we actually do find we desired and... didn't even know it!!\nAre even... useful and yes... fun,  a LOT of fun.\n\nIf you work seriously on the road... an iPad is not for you... at this time in its development... if you need a very cool slick device that is indeed just about the perfect weight and size for extreme portability happiness... and mainly want it for consumption, of information... then the iPad is wonderful.\n\nThe iPad is a very creative and evolving technology. The \"Cloud\" Apple's and say Dropbox... are bringing all of these devices together and we all are literally with our use... defining their place and potential and the APP ecosystem is indeed VITAL... .\n\nThat participation in change... is in itself fun to watch and to take part in... lets face it... our participation in that creative process by supporting what works is... a central part of an iPad's attractions... nothing wrong with that! That is the old America, remember her?\n\nCreativity  is sadly... so purposefully dimmed for political outcomes... in our dear country...that any tree of creative life left...is worth supporting even one without a real keyboard... ."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "A year ago, nobody had an iPad. Then Apple sold 15 million of them in just nine months, creating a whole new category of technology product. The iPad may have become, in the words of Steve Jobs, \"the most successful consumer product ever launched.\"\n\nIt turns out that a lot of people saw the iPad's appeal: it's a supremely portable device that's well suited for checking your e-mail, surfing the Web, playing games, reading books and other stuff you get off the Internet, and even for getting work done. Kids and the elderly have embraced it.\n\nIt's awfully hard to follow such a massive success, but that's the task set out for Apple's new iPad 2, which goes on sale Friday. At least the iPad 2 has this going for it: the original model caught the technology industry so flat-footed that only now are true competitors beginning to appear.\n\nThose competitors will now face a new iteration of the iPad, one that's faster, smaller, and lighter than the model introduced a year ago--all while retaining the $499 entry price that has proven all but impossible for Apple's competitors to match. It's almost unfair.\n\nA game of inches (and ounces)\n\nCall it Jobs's Law if you like: The latest version of any Apple product is likely to be thinner and lighter than its predecessor. And so it is with the iPad 2. The size difference between the original iPad and the iPad 2 may seem slight, but that's only because we're dealing with such small products to begin with. But for products this small, every ounce and fraction of an inch counts.\n\nThe iPad 2 measures 7.31 by 9.5 by 0.34 inches, and weighs in at 1.33 pounds (in the case of the Wi-Fi-only version, that is--the AT&T and Verizon 3G versions are .01 and .02 pound heavier). That means Apple shaved .17 pound off the Wi-Fi version and .26 to .27 pound off the 3G version. The iPad 2 is also .16 inch narrower, .06 inch shorter, and .16 inch thinner than the original iPad.\n\nA matter of small degrees, to be sure, until you consider the percentage change: the iPad 2 is roughly two-thirds the thickness of the original iPad, and 88 percent of its weight (83 percent when comparing 3G models). Pick up an iPad 2 after handling an original iPad, and you'll notice the difference right away. This is a lighter, thinner device."}

I tried out all 3 and a few more tablets before choosing the iPad 2. I bought the iPad because-\n1. Navigation was smooth with the iPad. With all other tablets, I noticed that the tablet would not react to the touch every once in a while.\n2. The tablet is for my wife. iOS is much more intuitive than Android when it comes to tablets. the complexity of use of Android is fine for techies, though.\n3. Assurance of OS upgrade. I know that my iPad 2 would be compatible with future versions of iOS and that Apple would allow free upgrades. At the time of my purchase, I wasn't so sure about Android based tablets (looking at how many Android based cellphones don't get timely OS upgrades)\n4. Flaws in other tablets. Every other tablet has flaws, which is pretty disappointing. Xoom is good, but they don't deliver what they promise (Read up on Xoom users' agony over the micro SD unusability for over 6 months). Sony tablet doesn't come with 3G.\n\nReasons why I took so long before buying the iPad:\n1. Dependence on iTunes\n2. No SD input\n3. Heavy price of accessories (like the one for connecting iPad to a TV)\n\nBut in the end, it was worth it. Now I rarely open my PC; I just find it too bulky and slow now. :)"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "After playing around an iPad2 in the Apple store, I did a little research, made the leap and bought one.\n\nBefore I placed my order, I had a few questions about which one I should get: Black or white? Would 16gb be enough, or should I go for 64gb (since it's not like you can add memory to it later)? Or maybe I should take the moderate middle road and get 32gb? I had definitely decided on WiFi, not because 3G doesn't appeal, but because I don't need another monthly bill. What about the Apple-refurbished iPads? Are they as good as the new? Is there any tangible difference? If these are the same questions you have, I'll try to flesh out these answers in detail -- as well as what the iPad is good for -- and what it is decidedly not good for, and what a dedicated PC-user (like myself) should expect from a first-time Apple purchase.\n\nTHE SPECS:\n\nSo, Question #1: White or black? I was instantly enamored by the white. It was so... different. And that is the reason to go for white. Perhaps the only one. However, the reasons not to go for white outweigh this almost immediately: Primarily, the contrast of the white does in fact make the screen appear less bright and vibrant (I noted this in the Apple store) and there are reports of light-leakage. I went for black, and have no regrets.\n\nQuestion #2: What size? This was probably the question I spent the most time on, and I felt as if I couldn't get a really good answer for it. Some people seemed to find 16gb to be more than enough, while others said even 64gb wasn't enough. I almost bought the 16gb, but ended up compromising and getting a 32gb refurbished from Apple for the same price as the new 16gb. And I'm really glad I did, because I've already used more than the 14.4gb -- which is the usable space available one the 16gb.\n\nThe 16gb, I've discovered, would have been ideal for someone only using apps and browsing the internet. Forget using it for music or movie storage, it's just not happening. On my iPad I have about 80 apps currently, consuming 5.6gb of space. Contrast that with the 1300 songs I have on there which are taking up about 8gb of space, and you'll see what I mean about 16gb being an apps-only device. So, if you already have an iPod, say, then it might make sense to get the 16gb.\n\nThe 32gb is ideal for apps and storing a moderate music library, something I never would have anticipated using the iPad for -- but it turns out, I always have my iPad in my car, and find it much more convenient overall than my CDs. I've even gotten rid of an old stereo I used to play CDs on in the house. They're just kind of obsolete once you switch to storing tunes on an i-device.\n\nThe 64gb, I imagine would be perfect for storing a little of everything: Music, movies and apps. I'm actually glad I didn't go for the 64gb, as I'm perfectly happy with YouTube or streaming Netflix for a nominal monthly fee (more on this in a moment).\n\nQuestion #3: Is a refurbished iPad as good as a new one? Although I don't have a new one to compare, I'm going to say yes -- with one minor caveat. The refurbished iPads have new glass, a new back cover, a new battery, the same 1 year warranty, and go through the same rounds of testing that a new iPad goes through (if you buy from Apple directly, of course). And when you think about it, why wouldn't this be just as good as getting a new iPad? After all, even a new one could have flaws that might become apparent in the first year of ownership. There aren't guarantees with any device, and when you can knock 20% off the price and make a vote for recycling electronics -- better for the Earth -- why not do it, right? Oh, and the caveat? There are a couple of times I have come across some settings that were clearly from the previous user which is... a little odd. Nonetheless the pros outweigh this, so far as I'm concerned.\n\nAll, told, if I had it to buy over again, I'd make precisely the same choices as this time: Black, 32gb, wifi, refurbished. So, onto the device itself....\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________THE IPAD:\n\nThis is my first i-device, and I have always been a PC (Windows) user in the past, so it's an entirely new experience to me. I bought it primarily because when laptop shopping I ended up getting a fantastic deal on this behemoth of a wide screen laptop. Not portable at all... so what about when I'm at the coffee shop or the bookstore and I want to tinker around, check my mail, Facebook, etc. Here's where the idea of getting an iPad came in for me. I wanted an easy-to-carry, reasonably-sized, aesthetically pleasing (and here's where the competing devices were blown out of the water) device to fill my portable computing needs.\n\nInterestingly, some of the things I initially bought the iPad for are the same areas where the iPad falls short. I knew there would be no flash capability, and so expected this. In truth, it's not been much of an issue, and YouTube is way better on the YouTube-dedicated iPad program than it is on my flash-enabled Windows 7 laptop. But its the simple demands that are over-complicated by the iPad. Email is a bit tedious. Like the way that you can only delete one item at a time, see one folder at a time, can't do certain things like 'star' an email to make the level of importance or permanently relegate something to a junk mail category. Note: This refers to the included email program, but even if you do your email through Safari there's going to be a lot of awkward pinch-zooming to awkwardly replace the awkward lack of functions in Apple's email program. Similar issues arise with the Facebook app: It's hard to see who's online, for one thing. I can't share a story from someone else's wall to my own, and most infuriatingly -- if I post a comment, and hit enter too soon (easy to do with the on-screen keyboard layout-- backspace and send are way too close to one another) I can find no way of deleting it -- aside from opening Facebook in a browser window and trying to navigate the too-small text and awkward formatting, when this should be a an obvious and simple maneuver on the iPad app for Facebook. This is true of many apps that replace simple browsing, from eBay to Amazon to social networking. Most are beautiful, well-laid out, and missing at least one (often more) necessary function. And speaking of function, while zooming is a simple task, cutting and pasting is beyond annoying -- so much so that I often say 'hell with it' and don't bother copying things I otherwise would have. Apple needs to overhaul that function.\n\nIt is the aesthetic beauty of the iPad that rescues it from a lesser star rating based on the lack of functionality inherent in some its apps/programs. I tried the Kindle Fire in the store and found it to be visually lacking in comparison -- and much slower as well. Meanwhile, the iPad is lightening fast with just about any task you set forth to do. It makes my laptop with better specs look like a dinosaur in contrast. The screen is breathtakingly beautiful (and unless you're trying to close out lots of open apps, incredibly responsive). It's so fun to just look at that you will find yourself wanting to store a photo library on there just to view the pictures on it. I love having pictures of my kids to show off on here for the older relatives at family get-togethers. It's definitely better than a traditional photo album -- and that sentiment comes from someone who is rather old-fashioned about anti-technological items like physical photo albums. Side note: My 300 moderately-sized photos are only eating about .5g of space. Another side note: The camera, while not graphically amazing, takes some of the speediest photos I've encountered with a digital device.\n\nJust as the iPad is able to display unparalleled beauty with photos, its video display is equally amazing. Since I care little for large-screen televisions, watching movies on here has actually made me consider getting rid of our two televisions. Netflix is convenient, the resolution and sound are perfect, and although the selection for streaming is quite limited, it fills our equally limited television needs. I haven't watched a single show on the television since I received the iPad, but I have watched the entire first season of Downton Abbey -- at my own convenience -- which was quite a luxury.\n\nLastly, the apps that are built *specifically* for the iPad: The games (like Contre Jour, Angry Birds, Cut the Rope), Garage Band, and Drawing Pad are awesome toys to have on hand --and affordable (as well they should be, considering the cost of the device itself). There are endless free apps to play around with, download, play with a bit and often delete -- occasionally saving the really exceptional ones. This is a great bonus to owning the iPad. My husband has an iPod touch, and the apps are far more interesting on the iPad.\n\nThere are even a number of educational apps that I didn't expect. I'm not one for computing for kids in most instances, and we stay away from all that LeapFrog and VTech madness -- instead opting for books. But I've been so impressed with apps like Solar Walk and Star Walk that I've been willing to make an exception. They're magical, and present really difficult concepts like the universe in a understandable way.\n\nDespite the iPad having some glaring flaws, I would buy it again. I believe now -- as I did when I chose it -- that it is the best tablet available. I can't stress how much I love perfection of the display. I've been pleasantly surprised by the unexpected things which it has been so handy for. I'd have loved to have known about its flaws in advance, which is why I write this review -- I hope someone else will go into their purchase feeling more informed and confident about their decision than I felt when I ordered mine. But if I had it to do again, I am pleased to say I'd make the same decisions all over again, so it was an easy 4 stars."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have wanted an iPad for a little over a year now, and I finally have one. I'm actually writing this review with it right now! A lot of people I know have criticized the iPad for being like the iPhone or iPod Touch, and I have to say while a lot of features are similar to my 3GS (don't own a touch), there are a lot of features which differ. I have had so much fun typing the screen of the iPad, I spent hours with the yahoo app talking to one of my friends while I installed my other apps. I am a college student and plan to use the iPad instead of my computer at school so I don't kill my back walking to class. I'm not the most tech savvy, but I know my way around the iPad from having my 3GS and love the simplicity of the device.  Besides, you can't beat the awesome of having almost full functionality of web pages through safari on the iPad. I continually get frustrated with my phone's version. I am not a fully converted Apple person since I still own a Sony Vaio and prefer the solidarity of The Sims 3 on PC. I also used a Mac last semester in school, and I just couldn't get used to it.\n\nI also REALLY love how much faster the iPad 2 is compared to the 3GS. It may not be a fair comparison but I also added 6 gigs if ram to my laptop so I could have a faster machine. I hate lag.\n\nOh! Not having adobe flash hasn't fazed me one bit. I don't really understand the argument about that one but the iPad has no trouble playing YouTube videos in safaris browser. It doesn't take you to the YouTube app like on the iPhone. I almost bought the Sony tablet which was recently released but I didn't feel like getting all my apps all over again since  I already own popular ones like angry birds. iTunes on the iPad has similar functionality to the program on the pc, and I'm assuming Mac, and I out most of the songs from my husbands accout in here. I also have never used a honey comb based tablet so iOS and iPad I went. iOS 5 installed in under 30 minutes for me.\n\nI have accidentally hit the back button in here twice with the iPad-the screen is extremely sensitive-and I don't think I can leave anything more useful for others considering the iPad, so I'll wrap it up. I got the 32 gig iPad in black and I've had a hard time putting it down. I'm also using a reflex series Otterbox and never plan on removing it from the iPad. I'm leaving a review for that next...but stop reading this! Get your iPad if you want one!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I had won an iPad 2 a few months ago by filling out a survey. Overall, i am very happy with the iPad 2. It is the 32GB model, so i have the extra storage. I have at least 70 apps and 3 songs and no videos on it and i only use up about 10GB so far. The ability to back up all of your documents, apps, music, etc. ti iCloud is a great feature. You get 5GB of free storage but then you can buy additional storage if you need it.\n\nEmail\nThe ability to check email on it is a great feature. I use the Xfinity Mobile App instead of the mail app though so the emails will delete and be marked as read on my computer too, not just my iPad.\n\nWeb\nThe ability to go on the web right from my iPad is also another great feature. If i need to look something up real quick i can just use the iPad instead of waiting for my computer to boot up.\n\nPrinting\nOne area that the iPad does need improvement in is the ability to print from it. We originally had a WiFi printer from Lexmark but did not have Airprint in it which is what you need to print from the iPad. So, i went to the store and bought a Kodak printer that says you can print from iPod, iPad, iPhone on it. I thought that that means that it has Airprint which is what you need to print from the iPad. Come to find out it doesn't have Airprint in it, BUT, you can download an app that lets you print from your iPad. So i get the printer all set up, connect it to my network, and try out the app. You need to save a screenshot of the screen you want to print from, the send it to the app which sends it to the printer, and it worked fine. Was just hoping i could use Airprint, but maybe next time.\n\nFlash Player\nI was a little dissapointed to find out that the iPad doesn't have a flash player built in. I can't open emails with videos in it or stuff on the web that requires flash player. I think apple should put built in flash player on the iPad, beacuse if they are going to compete against the Kindle Fire which has flash player, then they should seriously consider flash player. If you need a device that has a flash player, go with Kindle Fire."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "You are there, standing in the middle of the electronics department, credit card in hand, about to spend hundreds of dollars on a touch pad you can trust to be worth the money, and a good product. The store clerks are saying different things to you about each pad, and you don't know who to trust. Ladies and Gentlemen, the I Pad 2 is the correct item for you! It consists of app selection, optional WiFi, and other sources such as 4g. Coasting around the range of $800.00, I would suggest this particular system over any of the other available touch pads. I tried another once. I didn't like it. I would choose ipad2 over a regular i pad. why? many reasons.\n.It is faster\n.it looks better based on the fact that it is so thin.\n.Its the newest version, so why not take a go before it gets outdated?\nThe following are my views on this remarkable contraption. Also, I'm just going to call the I pad 2 an i pad just to make it easier. Just know that the I pad and I pad 2 are 2 different products. Sometimes, i will call it an i pad 2, but just so no one gets confused while reading this, there's a fact. Hope they help!\n\nFirst facts: This was a bummer, but based on Apple restrictions, the i pad 2 does not have flash, so it can't play online games or run certain programs that need flash. There is also no place for discs or flash drives, so you can't download saved work such as the data on flash drives or discs. You can't download programs like Microsoft office programs on this particular item, which is not fortunate, not to mention the fact that it doesn't connect to the printer. Hopefully some day it will evolve into better stats.\n\nCamera: For the most part i like the camera, but based on the fact i haven't seen or interacted with many other i pads except my own, which has a crooked, bury camera, it wasn't the best for me, but the other touch pad i owned had a horrible camera. I don't know how the other cameras look on the i pad 2 because i don't bother to put pictures of myself out into the public on the store tester i pads, so, keep the camera idea something to check on before buying. On the camera though you can make it look straigt ahead like a regular video camera or make it face the way you are looking at the screen, so it flips around depending on what kind of picture you want. I give MY experience on the camera a B grade\n\nApp selection: Great apps! Many apps are free, but 1 app's full version wasn't free on the i pad like it was on my other pad. I still don't think that should be a problem. Also the apps appear with fewer selections on the screen based on certain categories then my other touch pad, which appeared in a long list that was helpful. Although i would beleive that all together the ipad 2 has a wider selection of apps. Unlike some touch pads, The i pad 2 offers netflix, and many other apps that are one of the reasons i got the i pad in the first place. Great quality. I give the apps a A grade.\n\nBattery: The battery doesn't last very long. Sometimes, it last a long time, but for the most part, I always have it charging. This is a issue if i want to travel with it. I'm going to have to get a i pad car charger... Anyway, the battery issue may just be with only MY i pad 2 but I'm not really sure. I would give this category a C or B grade, but it has some work to do before it reaches an A.\n\nApp download speed: The apps for the most part download quickly, but there has been some times where the apps don't make any progress with loading so i usually have to delete it (and pray it will actually download) and download it again. In the end i always get ti worked out but its like, \"Come ON!\" you know? I give this category a A for it's amazing speed!\n\nWiFi quality: I love this category. Mine plays most H.D. videos and can just download apps from its app store rather then having to connect it to the computer to download things. That i can really appreciate. I can open up nearly all web-sights just the way they would appear on the internet unlike my last touch pad. I would say in order to get the full i pad 2 experience WiFi is a must-have. I give WiFi a A for great function!\n\nSpeakers: Lets put it this way, the speakers... they could use some work. Sometimes when i have it to the maximum sound it is hard to hear. That is not something that i favor based on the fact that the i pad is like, 40% sound, but i still like the product. If you have this problem i suggest going to a quieter area or plugging in ear phones to assure you get the most out of your money.\n\nCovers: I don't have a smart-cover. Perhaps the smart-covers do save the battery and make the screen sleep when you put the cover over it, but i have a cover that's not a smart-cover and it is just fine. As long as you turn it off when not in use for long periods of time any covers should work. Note that the cover should fit nicely around the i pad 2, that way, it is a better buy and protects the i pad more. i would suggest a case to help protect it and make a nice little stand for it. You can't exactly rate a cover because there are many different ones, but here is my rate on how important a cover is to have to me. A B. Its optional, but a good idea.\n\nApp Usage speed: Most of the apps i use are great, fast, functional, and don't have jerky movements. Take Talking Friends apps for example. They are fun, functional, and fast. Just how it should be, not to mention very clever. There isn't much to say about this particular category, but let me just say it deserves a A or B for nice function.\n\nNote where there should have been another Category view: I haven't had really any interaction with a regular i pad, so i can't say if the i pad 2 is really \"new and improved\", but i can say its good for me and very fast. Keep that in mind.\n\nVideo and Photo booth: I love making videos, so i was happy to hear that the i pad 2 came with a camera ready to make some videos! It is a personal highlight. Also photo booth is fun. seeing what your pictures look like in x-ray vision, and flipped, and so much more. I really liked that. too bad you can't film videos in photo booth :( Also note that both of these are the free apps that come right when you get the i pad. the video is connected to camera app.\n\nPersonal Favorites: I love the i pad 2, but my favorite features about it, are the following:\n.Its very thin and simple, which is very neat.\n.The apps are great and so are their function.\n.A i pad without WiFi is a very sad i pad.\n.Videos and photo booth.\n.speed!-------> ZOOM\n\nGRAND CLOSING..\nThese are all my opinions of different category in the i pad 2. Comment if there is more you want to know about the i pad 2 and i will see if i have an answer to add to this review for you. Thanks for reading! Hope it helped!!"}

I  am not too computer savvy,  the reason I purchased an IPad is for simple Internet use and watching shows and movies and going through my emails so far I can barely order on Amazon or open my emails. it does not support flash so not everything opens. also I have a hard time copying and pasting. It does not copy and if it does it's 50/50 chance of it working. My kid has a tablet kindle and it does a lot more than the IPad. I heard there's ways of fixing problem by purchasing Apps etc. I am still unhappy and I want my money back. My laptop is a better bargain."}

Fast forward to the present, and having used the iPad 2 for 2 months, I can honestly say it has transformed my digital life in our increasingly digital world.  My desktop and laptop have been gathering dust since acquiring the iPad 2.\n\nIt is the ultimate way to interact with just about all things digital.  With the right apps, you can do just about anything you can on a laptop, television, and gaming system, all in one sleek, stylish, and utterly portable device!  On a regular basis I use my iPad 2 to surf the web, compose and read e-mails, open and edit Microsoft Office documents, watch movies, listen to my MP3 collection, take and browse photos, make financial transactions, and play games that are just as good as what I can play on a computer or dedicated video game system.\n\nI'm hard pressed to come up with a single thing I dislike about the iPad 2."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I won't hash out the technical specs and details like other reviewers have probably done a few times before me.\n\nI love my iPad 2. My girlfriend just got me one for our anniversary. Funny thing is she just got one from her mom for Christmas at my suggestion. So now we both have one.\n\nShe just recently got wifi at work, too. She takes hers to work. She tends to call me about 3-4 times a day (at least it feels like that) and now she can call me on her iPad using Facetime, so she can see me as well. I don't really know how I feel about that feature sometimes, but it's pretty cool. I have other friends with iPads and iPhones and stuff, so we can all Facetime just like a house phone. It takes a little more effort to use it (just like Skype), but it's a really cool native app to the iPad. The camera quality is a bit to be desired. I think my Mac has a better camera than the iPad.\n\nAnyway, I'm not giving a review of Facetime. The iPad 2 is fast. The screen is pretty large compared to my iPod touch and my Droid X. It works well as a reader. The games work well on it. I've even used it as a drawing tablet a few times. I would link a photo I've drawn in my review, but I'm not sure I can do that.\n\nThe browser works just as well as it does on my Mac and my iPod touch. It's not the best thing in the world, but it works well.\n\nMail is still a problem for me. I can't get my Yahoo to work and I can't actually divulge why. I know the reason why and I'm not willing to fix it because it could be a slight security risk. Gmail works fine for me. I can't get my work e-mail to work either, but I haven't messed with it enough to really determine the reason just yet.\n\nThe iPads are great to have around to watch Netflix and things like that. Especially when there is a toddler that wants to watch something and everyone else is watching something on the big screen.\n\nFinally, the iPads are very expensive. So far my experience with Apple in the past few years is that they build a quality product and it tends to be worth it. I hope they continue this trend. I can't say whether or not it was worth the cost as I didn't shell out the money this time. I can only say that I'm enjoying the product and I'm very happy to have it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I'll be the first to admit, I love toys.  Gadgets, gizmos, anything electronic will catch my attention.  THese toys are great, but my fascination is not longterm.  Too soon after I spend my money on the latest \"must have\" the toy finds its way to the shelf as I move on.  I held off on purchasing an iPad2 because of the cost and because I was fearful it would spend $730 for something I would later stash away nver to use again.  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nI've had my iPad2 for about three months now and I love it more each day.  I'm using it everyday for several hours.  I use it for my work, and for fun.  I listen to music, watch movies, and play with fun, educational apps.  I have work-related apps.  I use it for my local government role so I do not need to print paper forms and other official documents.  I buy apps but I love the free ones.  It is a challenge to find useful apps for free.  I can manage my investments with it.  I can use Google Earth and travel the world.\n\nI no longer consider my iPad2 just a toy.  It is an intregal part of my life as I can quickly check emails and get headline news.  I can follow sports teams and have my music collection.  It is awkward to bring along during hikes, but I do have it in my car for the music.  I have podcasts and iBooks.  It will never replace my laptop, it will not replace my Kindle, but I cannot see myself without my iPad2.\n\nI strongly recommend the iPad2 to anyone who is even remotely considering buying one.

Ease of use is above and beyond any computing device I've ever had. Yes it's mostly a \"consumption device\", but that's about 90% of what I do at home. And for the other 10% (sending email, shopping, etc) the various apps work terrific. I barely use my laptop now, and I've ceased bringing it on vacations with me since my iPad can handle everything I would need to do on the road, and does it for longer.\n\nSome examples of how I've used it in the past few months:\n\n- Sold/traded in all of my programming reference manuals and bought ePub or Kindle versions of them all. My library went from a couple of hundred pounds of books to something that I can carry around with me at all times in my Timbuk2 bag.\n\n- Watched \"Prohibition\" Ken Burns mini-series on the plane to Key West with my girlfriend (that I easily transferred from my TiVo to my iPad). And while I was in the Keys I was able to browse online for activities and book day trips, find restaurants, etc. while tethered to my Android phone.\n\n- Played Scrabble / Words with Friends regularly with friends that live all over the country.\n\n- Read the news and check my email on it every morning.\n\n- Purchase/download all books I needed for grad school.\n\n- Used it for almost all of my Christmas shopping this year.\n\n- Introduced my family to my girlfriends family using Facetime.\n\n- Streamed music from iCloud/iTunes, SiriusXM and Pandora apps.\n\n- Used as a cookbook multiple times.\n\n- Watched movie on Netflix while plugged into the TV via HDMI in my hotel room on a business trip.\n\nEnough said... the fact that I've barely put the thing down since I've owned it is the best endorsement I can give. =)"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The Apple's iPad 2 is a huge hit at our house. My wife got one and I was so jealous I insisted I needed one as well. The uses are almost limitless. Best of all it is great for creating documents (writing novels), surfing the web, listening to music, and playing Apple games. In fact I only have one complaint about the lack of compatability with the Adobe Flash Player. Because of this it keeps you from playing a great many games including those on Facebook and other sites. Additionally certain videos at some sites will only play with the Adobe Flash Player. I hope in the interest of customer needs this will change in the future. Otherwise I am very satisfied with the iPad 2. I even got a&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Rover-App-Controlled-Spy-Tank-with-Night-Vision/dp/B005OQYOB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rover App-Controlled Spy Tank with Night Vision</a>&nbsp;to remotely control with the iPad so my wife and I can watch the house and cats remotely. That brings some peace of mind, not to mention the Rover is a blast to play with.\n\nYou can purchase cases and accessories to attach your iPad to your cars headrest to allow others to watch movies while traveling. There are a plethora of accessories for the iPad 2 so you will have plenty to choose from for covers, cases, adaptors, keyboards, et cetera. There are numerous apps that you can download to make it great for work and/or play. The apps can be free or range up to about twenty dollars on average. Most those I got were free or around four to seven dollars. I use mine extinsively because I can carry it anywhere and I don't have to sit at a desk to work on projects or listen to music and play games. If you're a highly mobile person this is a must have tool/toy.\n\nI imagine most students want one to make their homework easier to work on at school or home. Because of the decent drive space and WiFi you can almost do anything that you could do on a full size workstation whether you use a PC or Mac. Since you can even buy cases with keyboards it can easily replace a laptop for a lot less money and portability. Small enough to carry in a daily planner or purse it wins hands down in portability. Since you can now back files up on the web and use webmail it alleviates the headaches of more complex and costly workstation choices. You will still require a workstation to interface with for printing, transferring some files, USB transfers, and certain other functions. But at least when you need portability you will have it.\n\nAddendum: Although I am slightly disappointed that the iPad 3 came out on the heals of my purchase, I can't complain really as mine was purchased more for functionality than graphics.  One reader asked me if the WiFi was an issue to set up.  I didn't have any trouble with it.  In fact it's far easier than setting it up on a PC.  Once you set it up it automatically goes out and looks for a connection and will ask you which server to connect.  The beauty of it is if you decide you don't want to pay a monthly fee is you can just disable it until you want to use that feature again.  Now that the price has dropped on them, unless you need high resolution for movies or graphics, I recommend you seriously consider the iPad 2.\n\nCA Luster"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Ok now Im not rich so I don't have a Xoom and a Touchpad and a Tab and everything else to compare it too, but I can give you my review of the iPad itself.\nI looked into all of the other tablets too and from what I have found, the iPad was the best. While it does not have flash, I have so far found that to be no big deal anyway. if you absolutely have to have flash for something, look it up on your computer.\n\nTyping:\nTyping on it is not terrible but its not my favorite. I had an iPod touch and was used to typing on a touch screen so that part wasn't a big deal to me. The touchscreen itself is great and is very accurate as to actually registering the button you hit. This review is written on my laptop though because I knew that I wouldnt want to type several paragraphs on the iPad. For chatting on facebook or searching the internet and stuff like that though, it is actually really great.\n\nCameras:\nNow the cameras are not 100% what I expected them to be. They are decent but are still grainy. Granted I haven't taken pictures and then viewed them in normal size yet, so the graininess is just being blown up to iPad size. It might get better if it is shrunken down but so far it seems grainy to me. Really though, its better than not having a camera at all.\n\nApps:\nPhotobooth seems to be the most fun app for showing off the iPad to other people. it was nice that it came with it instead of having to buy it. All of the other apps pretty much work like the iPod touch's apps do, and I love the iPod touch. The email is a lot nice to use now that it is updated.\nGarageband is great! for $5 its the cheapest and best audio recording software you can get. It was the first thing that I bought and have been playing with it ever since. I like that you can play the instruments right on the iPad and record and edit it all.\nSafari is a really great and simple browser and it feels really natural to search the web on it\niPod is really good too its like having your iTunes library on your computer and being able to go through all of your songs and have it all spread out where you can see it all\nI bought Legendary Blade II also for a few bucks and it really shows off how great the iPads graphics are\n\nScreen:\nLike I said above the graphics are really really good on it. My old iPod apps have all had to be updated because they are not even close to the quality that the iPad demands to look good. I think that the best way to see how good the graphics are is with books. the quality of writing is better than on my laptop.\nThe touchscreen interface is the best that I have seen on any of the gadgets ive played with. Apple has dominated the touchcreen market and I don't think anyone comes close to them.\n\nSmart Cover:\nI don't know what it will do over the long run but so far it is great! I didn't buy it from amazon so i don't know what the legitimacy of the seller is, but as for the smart cover itself, I love it. the auto on auto off works great and so does the auto align. It looks great on the iPad 2 and it adds practically no thickness whatsoever. I feel like it actually does protect the iPad and it does its job. when it is rolled up and used as a stand it feels sturdy in both positions. I couldn't be more happy with it. clearly it doesnt protect the back from scratches and stuff, but the back is solid aluminum. aside from a few scratches, its not going to hurt it. I don't plan to drop my iPad, but i feel like if i did drop it face down its strong and cushioned enough that it wouldnt destroy my screen either. I would definitely buy it again\n\nMemory:\nI got the 16 gig and it has more than enough for my 600 songs a 125 apps.\n\nI would totally recommend this to anyone and if anything changes I will update\nThat is all I have but if you found it helpful I would really appreciate you taking a few seconds to hit the helpful button :) Thanks"}

I bought my husband the IPad 2 for a Christmas present, gave it to him early [1 week early], so it could be up and running for Xmas day. Well it will not print to our network that has an HP 4600dnt LaserJet printer, bummer. I have spent about 3 hours trying to figure out different apps to make it work. Fortunately he is not at this time a hard core tech, not even a small time one and might not really need to print anything, just play games. I have tried to figure out Air Print and it looks like it will only work with newer printers that have the program installed, so just be aware.\n\nLot of money and appears to be better, easier up start products on the market. I think some Apple people are just so use to apple products and just don't know there are other quality, products that operate the same that are maybe half to 3/4's of the cost. It took me an hour just to figure out how to get a desktop on the Ipad. I had to hook up the Ipad to my pc then go to a website to download, I have never had to do that with any other product that wasn't an Apple product.\n\nHopefully this helps someone that is on the fence with an Apple product.\n\nUpdate 12-26-2011. Well I have been every forum everywhere and have got just a load of info and wonderful people with lots of suggestions and man, this apple stuff is tough on compatibility even within it's own community. I have never cared for Apple products and nothing has changed.\n\nThanks to all who have tried to help, just glad this belongs to my husband, who just wants to play games and see his racing forms."}

Through gritted teeth whilst my friends enjoyed the cute novelty of the first release, I sweated out the wait for the version with the itty bitty webcameras and it was well worth the wait.  What is the point if you can't skype or facetime?\n\nAn iPad is simply handicapped without a webcam, well, Apple made up for it with a vengence by having TWO in version 2! One at the back one at the front to toggle between.  Making self-photography a breeze to compose and shoot with minimal error.  FaceTime, the apple version of skype now comes bundled to facilitate easy \"skype-ing\" between iPad owners (akin to free video calls on the back of a wifi network).  This is video networking made accessible to the masses.\n\nThis also becomes your camera and video camera for web publishing - the resolution though not the highest is laudable. And the pixel warehouse for your digital camera to download to when one is travelling.\n\nLike the iPhone, the iPad further usurps the position of the iPod relegating it further into the abyss of obsolescence - by incorporating a digital iPod inside for portable music & video storage and playback. It is not hard to allow one's life to revolve around this little tablet which makes it both a great productivity & recreational tool. Akin the hp's iPaq in 2004 except much more versatile graphically and with a much improved touchscreen.\n\nThe plethora of apps available at the Apple appStore is like a digital candy store (hundreds of thousands). So much to sample so much to buy.  Brilliant marketing to make it so cheaply available.  The volume drive works beautifully during this post GFC era where excesses are a little less rampant and frugality rules the day. 0.99 cents for a shot of adrenalin or seretonin secretion is not an unattractive proposition.\n\nGoodbye to clutter as subscriptions go digital.  And you get to carry your entire collection (of music, newspapers, magazines, books & photographs) with you wherever you go, all contained within less than 595g of hip and style.\n\nHowever security issues are not yet airtight hence I would hesitate to use this for personal banking or other such uses\n\nA Happy Camper =)\n\nps...musicians can now digitally purchase musicsheets and store, transport them in this compact little marvel - reducing clutter, making the entire repertoire portable and easily accompany you everywhere, to practice, to recitals, etc. The only downside perhaps is you get one page at a time instead of the usual 2 page spread."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I initially didn't upgrade my iPad 1 to the 2nd generation as it was \"good enough\" for my needs. But as time went by and iOS5 was released I found my iPad 1 a bit lacking... Safari would often crash and more recent games such as Infinite Blade (the first one) wouldn't even load without crashing. It was becoming that I was getting a bit miffed with my iPad so I sold it off recently to wait for the iPad 3. Without an iPad in my life there was a bit of a void and I took advantage of one of the many resllers of the iPad 2 in the Marketplace. I found a great deal for a perfectly mint condition iPad and I have to say I am loving my iPad 2. No more crashing, the iPad 2 is really FAST and I feel it will be a bit more \"future proof\" for next year's iOS6 and even iOS7.\n\nThough it doesn't have the rumored retina display of the iPad 3 I feel that if you can get an iPad 2 for less than retail price right now it is well worth the purchase, even this close to the release of the next incarnation. Not to mention that a retina display for a device this large is less important than on an iPhone where the image size is much smaller. The only thing a Retina display will improve is the reading of ebooks and honestly not by that much. It's not as if it goes from illegible to crystal clear, just slightly more crisp... and for my needs not as necessary since I don't read much on my iPad to begin with. Also remember higher resolution also means more battery usage... so unless they put a bigger battery in the next iPad the battery life will be impacted. If they put a larger battery then the iPad 3 itself will be larger.\n\nWhich leads to another thing I love about the iPad 2, the size! It is insanely thin compared to the first iPad and quite a bit lighter in hand. Now my left arm will have less of a work out when I'm standing and working on the iPad. :P\n\nMirroring with an Apple TV is beyond fun and a great feature for those of you who want a HTPC but don't want to deal with the high prices of Mac Mini or a Windows HTPC. Now I can surf the web on my TV and stream (soon to be) any video found on the internet. As Apple declared Flash video is on the down swing and soon it'll bow out of the way to h. 264 as the go to streaming media format.\n\nThe iPad 3 will no doubt be great... and I'm sure I will upgrade to it too... NEXT winter.\n\nI paired my iPad with the perfect;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/KHOMO-DUAL-CASE-Grey-Polyurethane-Smart-Cover-FRONT-Hard-Rubberized-Poly-carbonate-BACK-Protector-for-Apple-iPad-2/dp/B005CI8836/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">KHOMO DUAL CASE: Grey Polyurethane Smart Cover FRONT + Hard Rubberized Poly-carbonate BACK Protector for Apple iPad 2</a>(I found one \"used-like new\" from Warehouse deals for $17.99)\nOriginally I had the Incase Magazine Case for my iPad which the Apple Smart Covers and this case mimics. Though there were features on the Magazine case that I will miss (3rd standing option that was between the vertical mode and the keyboard mode) this is by far the best looking feeling and quality full body protection that I have seen for any of the iPads. I loved the idea of the Smart Cover but hated the price and the fact there was no back protection. Also heard that the magnetic connectors end up scratching the iPad and falls off easily, this is not something I wanted.\n\nVery happy with my purchase and am glad I got myself this great Xmas gift."}

As for connectivity, it is only WiFi, so it can have its limitations as far as access to online informations are concerned, but with the IPhones handy, it is kind of OK.\n\nWhat makes it different from the Iphones and the ITouch is primarily the display size, which on many occasions are far more feasible than the smaller units. There is just so many things that are much better on a bigger screen than it be on the smaller units, net browsing and entertainment, not to mention the Medical Programs that are available in the iTunes store. And that is an other plus for the unit, all being the same brand, they are all synchronized and maintained through a single account, which makes the control of context so much easier compared to having different brands units, organized with different environments and operating systems.\n\nAs for the connectivity issue, it being only WiFi, I have a HUB that allows me to connect 5 wifi units on one 3G network, and thou I must admit I have not used it that often yet, but it has it's benefits.\n\n12/26/2011: just had to add this small remark to my review. I have been in Dubai for the last 3 days, and with my this iPad, I have been able to keep in constant contact with my Hon, via SMS text and voice/video (via FaceTime) ... That being despite it is only a WiFi unit. I have to say, that is rather marvellous ....\n\nFor the unit, for maintain, a Screen protector is highly recommended. Given the fact that it is a touch screen, even if the protector gets scratched up, you can just replace that instead of having to replace the screen itself. Also, a hard case is recommended, in my case, MA Hon got me a book case, which fold and serves as a stand as well. As for a stylus, a Soft Rubber unit is the best, I have a belkin, but I am sure you be able to find some less expensive ones that serves the purpose just as well.\n\nI have had the unit for 10 days now, and have yet to explore MANY options available, but given the fact that I have been using the Apple's units for years now, it is all coming easy. But I can highly recommend it. Surely the Apple products are a bit pricy compared to some of the competing units, but for my needs, the compatibility and access that it offers with the other units that I possess, it is worth the couple of extra bucks. Not to mention the fact that the Apple units are some of the most beautiful and state of the art units that are available on the market, and the drawback of shortage of available softwares....

It arrived with the plastic on it so I am expecting it to be brand new and hope it will work perfectly.  I know she will love it on December 25th. I expect it to be the real ipad 2 and not a fake.  Looks good on the outside."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have been a hold out for several years now.  I would tell people \"I have an iPhone so why get just a bigger version?\"  My wife wanted to get an e-reader so I decided to put my money where my mouth was and buy a couple of iPads for us.  Hers would likely be a casual use device but I was going to try to use mine for business moving to a paperless work style (attempt #1,324 over the course of 12 years of different devices).\n\nInitial review was good... liked the device feel, weight, etc.  Clearly it looked nice.  I was offended at the cost of covers and accessories but I had somewhat gotten over that shock with the iPhone so it wasn't a new shock :) I felt that a lot of the app makers did a good job with their iPhone/iPad combined apps but it does suck to have to buy a separate app for those that don't have the combined versions.  But, overall a nice design and fun product to use.\n\nBut, there's a big but here, it's too fragile and no recourse from an accident.  Like many others before me I broke mine.  Total bone-head move on my part, not at all an Apple fault in my situation, but if you spend some time reviewing forums you'll see the advice I failed to read.  The device is incredibly fragile so even simple (aka not bone-headed) slips, drops, and bumps will leave you with a busted screen.  With no attractive means of recourse.  One would think that any product with a propensity for a major functional piece to break there would be a repair option.  Not the case with Apple.  Probably part of the business plan to be honest.  I tried to find out my options and costs (secretly hoping for a free replacement like others have touted) but two different stores told me 1) not repairable by anyone; 2) any signs or attempt at repair void warranty; and 3) only option is a \"courtesy\" replacement for $270 (16mb wifi version).  No option for repair internally at Apple, let alone an option more reasonable than spending another $300.  I checked and the local repair place quoted about $185 plus tax and the parts I found online looked to run about $150+.  For a glass screen!\n\nApple has a unique luxury in that they have a large client base that feels Apple can do no wrong.  An Apple \"genius\" could swing by the house at Thanksgiving and slap the loyalists grandmother and Apple would still be held up on a pedestal - the turkey was dry after-all.  So they don't bat an eye if iTunes misbehaves (the user shouldn't have tried to sync contacts), or if they try to connect with Outlook (the user shouldn't consider another product not made by Apple), or consider a good product would have given repair considerations to a critical yet fragile component.  The Apple flock is a great thing to have for a business.\n\nSo anyway, I would say the iPad is a great device.  It'd be better if the screen were more widget based like the android options, but it's snazzy, quick, and a joy to use.  But, leave it sitting alone on the desk and protect it with your life if you buy it.  Otherwise buy an android option for half the price and if you could bust it three times and still be less expensive than the Apple will arguably as good of performance."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "All I can say about the iPad 2 is that it is simply amazing. The faster 1 ghz dual core A5 processor is a workhorse. The display is very high quality and is very easy on the eyes. Watching movies and surfing the web over WiFi is a joy, especially compared to the iPhone 4 which I have and love, but the limited browsing capabilities of the iPhone is enough to make you want for something larger. For iPhone users, the interface is familiar and easy to adapt to, and for new users, it is easy to learn. The iPod and Videos features are nice to have when travelling, and for those who like to read, the iBooks app is a capable book reader and there are thousands of ePub books and PDF files out there to load up on. For people that use Office to write letters and school papers, there is the iLife office suite which is Office compatible in most cases.\n\nThere is a bonus for musicians. The iPad is becoming a professional tool for musicians with a plethora of music utilities, software synths (including a few Moog products), guitar amp simulators and even Garage Band to write and record on the go. The only thing is I wish it were more of an open platform and I wish it had stereo speakers, although most times I listen with earbuds.\n\nIf you are thinking of the Kindle Fire or an Android tablet, the only advice I can give is DON'T ... The iPad 2 is a great tablet, and is constantly growing to meet the needs of all different types of users."}

I plan to use wifi only and add 3G at times I think I might need it.\n\nThe iPad2 comes with some fantastic apps. and many, many others are available at the App Store. Lots are free!!!\n\nIn my case the advertisements about using the iPad2 \"right out of the box without the need for a computer,\" were wrong as I had to set mine up using iTunes on my computer!\n\nThe browser is fast and no waiting for pages to load. . . with a full signal that is.  The weaker the signal on wi-fi, the slower the load but I guess that's to be expected. Dropping even one bar makes a huge difference. Also it's not compatable with Flash which is why I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars.\n\nI love the portability, the design and mostly everything about my iPad2.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "As a matter of full disclosure, I am normally a Windows OS and Android user. I won my iPad 2 as a holiday party prize from my workplace. Also, I do not own an Android tablet (yet). To avoid being labeled as a Fandroid, I will list what I liked about the iPad first (yes, there are things that Apple does well):\n\n- the hardware design is indeed well thought out: thin, light, and nice to look at\n- construction and quality appear to be top notch\n- the screen display is sharp and bright\n- iOS for all of its shortcoming runs very smoothly on this device\n- tons of apps in the App store\n- insane battery life -> This thing has the best battery life of any backlit display device I've ever used. It probably can go 4-5 days between chargings with average web usage.\n- instant on -> best thing about a tablet in general: instant web browsing\n- the perfect device for consuming media (Web browsing, videos, games) in bed\n\nNow, on to what I didn't like:\n\n- I have to use iTunes -> First thing that the tablet signaled for me to do was plug it in to the computer and install iTunes\n- no back button\n- Safari sucks -> First thing I downloaded from the app store was Dolphin HD\n- no expandable storage (well known)\n- no Flash -> sure Adobe has decided to stop supporting this for mobile devices, but for the moment there are still plenty of sites which use it. I was surprised by how many sites to which I can't view content. For a device which purports to be great at Web browsing, this kinda sucks.\n- limited customization of iOS - it's a tray of icons and that's it. Barely can be called an OS.\n\nAlthough I hate that the iPad doesn't have expandable storage, USB ports, etc, that is the Apple way. It always has been. The Apple ecosystem is very closed and restrictive. I am positive the iPad 3 won't have any USB ports on it either. However, the main reasons why I'm only giving this device 4 stars are: iTunes, iOS and the lack of Flash. For the amount people pay for this thing, you should be able to access 100% of the sites out there. All this being said, and it pains me to say it, Apple still has no equal in producing a sexy piece of high quality hardware. Disregarding specs (i.e. processor speed, RAM) the iPad 2 is still the benchmark hardware for tablets. Just think if this thing had flash, a USB port and you didn't need iTunes to access it from your computer. Now that would be something.\n\nOne additional comment on tablet devices in general. Nobody NEEDS one of these things. They are, in my opinion, the ultimate in media consumption (videos, e-books, games, browsing, social networking) which is the opposite of productivity. Seriously, the main reason I wanted one was so I didn't have to wait the 120 seconds it takes to boot up my laptop to browse the Web. And also so I could browse literally anywhere in my house. Definitely, these are wants and not needs. Just a thought."}

But with the newly redesigned exterior, upgraded hardware, and my wife desperately wanting one more than I did, I finally ended up getting one.  So far we are tremendously satisfy and uses it more often than we ever thought we would.\n\nThe new iPad 2 is slimmer, sleeker, faster, and lighter than it's predecessor while retaining the same display size.  Upgraded with a faster processor, it runs a lot smoother and able to multitask more quickly without getting overheated or apps crashing.  The traditional aluminum back casing makes its return with a sexy sleek taper design.  I always feel the sense of durability and toughness, just an overall very solid constructed piece of work whenever I'm handling it, even when dropped, multiple times.  Both higher megapixel cameras front and back allowing better quality photos, video, and greater facetime moments with family and friends.  These are just the major improvements over the original that I feel is already worth it's purchase.\n\nI've tried several different tablets and non is as user friendly and simple to navigate as the iPad 2.

While its price may be a little expensive I defiantly think it's worth every penny.\nPart of the reason the iPad  is perfect for travel is that you can use it in any position, unlike a laptop, where you have to find a seat\n It won't ever got hot or overheat. Personally, I've had a couple laptops expire on me due to overheating. You always have to keep them on a firm surface so you don't block the vents. The iPad doesn't have these problems. You no longer have to grab a tray or giant book to set your laptop on when using it in bed.\nVideo Skype works great on this tablet - the cameras make showing people things FAR simpler due to the front and back placement.\nThe battery life is excellent! This thing can go for two days without a recharge! And that's with fairly heavy usage (try that with a laptop!)\nThe touchscreen is extremely responsive, the machine is very fast - wifi works extremely well.\nThe only issue I have is the reflective screen - I am not a fan of the reflective screen and have ordered a matte screen protector - not because I feel it needs protecting, but because I want to be able to read in various lighting conditions."}

It was absolutely amazing for about the first hour that I used it.  However, once the novelty of it has worn off it isn't extremely useful.

Original iPad was my first one, which was bought as a gift for my friend and accidentally became a good entertainment for me and my wife. It's a great product, one of a very few gadgets I find myself truly love to use and feel the convenience and ease of use that rarely comes with a product that is sophisticated in its functionality and simple in its design. The reason I talk about my iPad in a iPad 2 review is that I want to give you a perspective of how I loved my iPad and all the good things about iPad has been improved and perfected, either in a subtle or substantive way, in iPad 2. The most obvious change I sensed were two things, a significant reduce in weight and a increase in processing speed. I have frequently found myself looking for iPad 2 at home to have a google search job done even though iPad is up front of my eyes.\n\nAnother thing I came to appreciate both iPad and iPad 2 is their intuitive user interface. Quite opposite to a technology geek as I am, my mom has no knowledge in what an operating system is and has no idea how her order is fulfilled by a computing device, be it a pc or whatever else. This makes it very hard to explain to her how she should interact with the interface of an operating system. To her, opening up an application on a Windows desktop, in the start menu and Notification area are fundamentally different actions that take conceptually distinctive approaches to accomplish. Such understanding and confusion in opening different application have soon disappeared after only a few practices with the iPad home button. And now she is happily occupied herself with the Bakery Story app on a device easiest ever to use."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I bought the white 16GB ipad during the black friday deals on the apple page, for around 450 plus tax, so hardly cheaper than on Amazon now.\n\nI did buy this for my parents, based on reviews. All reviews agree on the following: 1) the ipad is still the best tablet around and 2) it is the easiest to use. Well, both statements are wrong. Since so much has been said already on the ipad let me get straight to the issues:\n\n- Being an android user (phone-wise) I got so used to the back button. On the ipad there is no such thing. If you push home, you get straight to home screen. If you want to go back one stap within an app, touch the screen and search and search for \"back\" on the screen. It is very inefficient. Also when installing multiple apps from the market you have to go back and forth several times.\n\n- The screen resolution is too low. Webpages do not look as good as on other tablets. While 4:3 format makes some sense, given that you use it also in portrait, the low resolution looks just outdated. Ok, I knew that before, but I did not expect it to be as disturbing.\n\n- Google. Apple fights its war with google to the disadvantage of consumers. No Picasa integration! Seriously, this is just poitics! They want to take control over you, so you are not supposed to use google sevices. You will also miss other google apps if you know android.\n\n- No official google talk! Say goodbye to you android using friends.\n\n- Amazon. They had to circumvent Apples policy using a web app for their services. Just because they want to force you into itunes. Once you are in itunes, you are forced into buying apple products forever. Why give up the freedom of choice? Lets say apple products were getting worse and in 5 years all your money is in itunes items. Do you want that? Hell, no. If you buy music with Amazon you remain independent of the hardware provider at least. The ipad is a mere retail channel (like the kindle fire, only more expensive). It does not give you freedom like galaxy tab.\n\n- USB. No real port. Ok, buy the adapter. 30 bucks. Find out it serves only 20mah. So it is not USB, as it is not following the standard which 100. It is disfunctional! You need workarounds.\n\n- The whole device is about workarounds. Apps. Paid apps! Apple earns on programms that give you DLNA, THE STANDARD to stream movies to your tv. Or they earn on making you buy the apple tv box. But Apple just ignores and established standard.\n\n- Antitrust, where are you? Microsoft would have been sued to death for what apple is doing here!!!\n\n- File access. Forget it. This is again about workarounds. Dropbox etc. Well, but I wanted this for my parents. Supposed to be easy, but IT IS NOT. It is f difficult to find all the f workarounds. To start actually working with this.\n\nConclusion. Decent pad to surf with nonflash browser. Bound to apple channels for buying digital stuff, basically a retail access you are paying for. Imagine paying your supermarket just for being there. Everything else is disfunctional, not following standards, locking you in, making you search for workarounds and thereby stealing your time. It is NOT EASY to use, compared with android.\n\nGet something else. Not the ipad."}

With a wide range of available applications from the App Store and also through my company, I have everything I need to stay productive.  Because I also got the 3G model, it works whereever I go in the United States.\n\nHardware: The screen is bright and a joy to look at.  Multitouch works very well and instantaneously fast.  There is no lag at all in moving across apps. The battery lasts all day long and worked well on 10 hour international flights.\n\nSoftware: iOS 5 is a joy to use and gives me all the flexibility that I want. I wish you could use it as a wifi hotspot but maybe they'll allow that one day."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "What makes Apple a great company is the amount of polish they put on their finished devices that ensure they work and work well. Bugs and other device problems aren't something you come to expect from Apple because of the tireless work that goes into making sure the manufactured parts work together in harmony. This was something manufacturers of other tablets did not do when they rushed their way to the market Apple was claiming all to itself. The result was a number of products, most of which had bugs or other serious performance problems.\n\nAnyway, the iPad 2 bulked up a bit from its predecessor. A dual core processor and a little more RAM helped keep this device up with the Johnsons, spec-wise. Usability-wise, it's still as friendly to the user as can be. The interface isn't complicated and anyone familiar with how an iPhone works will have no problem getting into this device right away.\n\nCameras on front and back were added. It's a shame they couldn't get a HD camera sensor in the device because that would make Facetime all the better. As it is, the video quality isn't that great but it does what it says it does and the video chat function works pretty nice. The back camera? Never used it and don't plan to.\n\nThen there is the App Store itself. Instead of paying $69.99 every time you need to feed your kid's hunger for a new game, you can drop 99 cents for most applications, whether they are games or educational apps or any of the vast amount of programs created that fit anyone's budget. As tablets become more and more popular, more and more content is finding its way onto the device. ABC has a player where you can watch their new shows in their entirety. HBO has one, too. Doctors are using these devices as they make patient records easily available. Teachers use these to track grades for their classes and educational apps help them figure out what subject matter their students may be struggling with. And these are just two niche examples of what the device can do. As an everyday consumer, you can really shape this device around your life and even find applications that make your professional life easier.\n\nFor a portable, in your bed experience, this works wonders. The backlight trims when it detects low lighting so your eyes won't strain. The 10 inch screen is more than enough for watching Netflix or other content you can stream (I use AirVideo since I have a lot of media on my home machine and it streams it all -- .AVI, .MKV, .MP4 -- perfectly).\n\nIf you take this wifi model out of the house and find yourself in places where you don't have wifi access, you can still use whatever apps you have that don't require an Internet connection, or you can play videos that you store on the device. Since this is Apple we're talking about, you can find apps that will play any kind of media so you aren't stuck with just the .MP4 codec that Apple would prefer you use.\n\nThere aren't many limitations to the device...Adobe Flash support is usually cited among the things people don't like about the device. Good news on that front: Adobe is abandoning Flash for mobile devices (in part because they can't fix the non-stop security holes Flash has) so eventually that won't be a concern. Steve Jobs said Adobe Flash was garbage and didn't get support for it with the iPad. Other manufacturers chose to include Flash but it didn't take long before they admitted it killed the battery life on their devices, while the iPad2 can go all day without needing a charge. Watch movies all day. Play games all day. You don't need this hooked up to a power outlet all the time like you would a laptop and this is much easier to carry around, so the number of situations you can use this device (waiting rooms, long car trips, air travel) goes way up.\n\nThere are many things to like about this device and there are some drawbacks (no USB support besides tethering to your computer, no HDMI, no Adobe Flash and no expanded memory card slots. But they are few and nearly insignificant when you realize there are alternatives to the roadblocks you think you may face, including cloud storage.\n\nThis tablet is the cream of the crop. There is some good competition out there but the ease-of-use, availability of 70,000 plus apps in the Apple app store, plus how dependable the device is keeps Apple on the throne of best tablet manufacturer."}

Sure it has whisper net, but no \"Surfing capabilities that I am aware of. The IPad 2 solved all that. Just a small learning curve,(a couple of hours)and I was  off and running.

You can purchase the adaptors for $81.00 or get a refund \", and a refund i sure got by sending back that device.\n\nWith this type of attitude of superiority, and the tragic loss of their genius, I don't give more than 5 years for Apple to face the music.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I thought about getting a tablet a hundred and seventy  eight times before finally buying one. I have a couple of laptops and a mac desktop so I wondered if I really need one. I know it isn't that expensive to own but then I also had 2 iPod Touches. So basically I was going to get the iPad 1 first but then they came out with the iPad 2, I waited several months and then like any man who hates indecision I decided to get a tablet. The choice was simple. I was used to the iPod Touch (4th generation) and thought this would possibly be similar. I was worried it would sit in one corner of my house. To clarify I never needed an iPad, what I did like however the most was the speaker on it. You see, i'm big on music and wanted something that can behave like a traveling jukebox. Besides watching a film when I'm on an airplane  won't be a bad idea either. I was sincerely considering getting the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 but then I knew this thing has been the best selling product of all time so I decided to get it anyway. I've had it for a little over a month now and in the following points i shall speak of the features, some unique and share my findings with you.\n\nUNIQUE FEATURES OF THE IPAD 2 -\n\n1. At 9.7 inches of diagonal length and brightness that is nothing short of being called exquisite one would imagine this thing to have an average battery or a good battery but the battery life is extraordinary. I use my iPad for a couple of hours daily and I must say that despite music playback, wireless data transferring to the iPad from my mac iTunes library, this thing lasts me for at least 5 days. This is remarkable. I can give you the best device in the world as a manufacturer but if the battery life isn't good what good is it to keep charging it. It does take a very long time to charge mind you which tells you that it's gonna last you a while. For some bizarre reason I like to charge this with my Mac. Charging using the wall outlet is slowly getting primitive.\n\n2. The speaker is amazing, it's loud and clear but you have to know where the speakers are placed and it's very important or else it will hamper your experience. Sometimes you have to hold it in your hands to make sure the sound output is ideal. Does it work well placing it on  a flat surface glass or  wood? Yes. What do I use the speaker for? iPod. At 16GB this is just about enough for me to carry a contemporary selection of music  and films with me. Does it sound good while browsing internet pages? Yes. Youtube is exhilarating to say the least. Also only selected Facebook videos will work because many are not available on mobile devices so if something doesn't run on your iPhone or android phone, it may not run on the iPad. Fair trade.\n\n3. There are two cameras, both are sub par for 2011 but if you're sitting in a dimly lit room and have washed your face, it may just somehow take a nice photo of you but I seldom take pictures from it. I like to record 30 second to 1 minute videos and email it directly to people. I always keep it connected with my wifi. This is really convenient and is a NEW WAY for me to keep in touch. I never did this with my mac or my iPhone. Also please note an interesting thing here, if your video is too long, your iPad tells you that you cannot send it owing to the large size. I have not gotten into the whole editing video and cutting it thing so what I then resort to is UPLOADING  IT DIRECTLY ON YOUTUBE. Great feature though quality is to be compromised slightly.\n\n4. The iPad 2 weighs less than the iPad 1 by a significant amount. This shall be reason enough for people to upgrade or maybe you guys can wait for the iPad 3 to come out in April next year (random estimate)\n\n5. While typing on the iPad is a breeze for \"novices\" and \"intermediates\" it is not ideal for a super fast expert typer. Having said that I don't use it much for typing. I am much faster on my phone than I am on the iPad. I have noticed i am able to type best when I am not holding the tablet in my hands and it is resting on a surface. Now I have installed a invisible shield for it because it liked to keep a daily account of fingerprints. Did I find an ideal one? No. I also use an invisible PLASTIGLASS thing for the back which I found on Amazon and found super amazing. The back is so smooth even with this accessory. I find the leather cases a little too pricey and there are several available but I find them kind of obstructing to the design of this iPad and a little cheap so I don't use.\n\n6. Great company on an airplane - While I am always fidgeting with this device when it's playing something, the device makes for great company on an airplane provided you have an \"mp4\" type file to play back on it. You can easily install it using iTunes. But if you have  an avi file or a divx file I don't know how to play them or transfer them. The iPad doesn't work as a USB STORAGE device so it won't show up on your finder (or my computer) when connected. There is no way for a user to save files by dragging and dropping. WHILE MANY ARGUE over the relevance of such storage, I believe the absence of it helps in keeping things organized and we all could do with a little less clutter. iTunes works beautifully for transferring stuff. I have noticed on all apple platforms (iPhone, iPod, iPad) that uploading a picture to Facebook involves more steps than on Android. Infact in certain cases Apple makes you buy an application to upload files to Facebook for the iPad. I find this cheek quite amusing but I take it with a pinch of humor. While playing back video you can tilt the device in any which way you want and the screen tilts that way. The video output is superior and the tilt  helps so it makes sure your fingers don't keep smacking into the headset jack when headphones are attached.\n\n7. Browsing - Yahoo looks utterly brilliant on the iPad. I love to go  once a day and simply look at their news features. Most search engines have specific websites for the tablets to access em and it looks super. My friend has a Xoom and he loves his tablet and is always talking about it but I see a sincere longing in him for an Apple iPad. The interface is unmatchable whether you are browsing, playing back a video or a song, the iPad wins. I do not use this as a task keeper so I don't bother with office utilities and all. Neither do I edit videos on the iPad but I believe there are inexpensive  solutions available. I read about them all the time on Macworld. Browsing on the internet, watching youtube videos, being on Facebook - it all seems flawless on the iPad. Much better than using a computer or an iPod or a phone. This is where the iPad truly shines. The font and the brightness I repeat is flawless and magical - nothing like i have seen in a dozen years of computers.\n\n8. TRANSFER - With the new ios 5.00  and iCloud I can actually send music, video, pictures to the iPad or play them back on my mac without connecting. Another big significant improvement. Now if only I could charge it wirelessly :)\n\n9. Are you thinking about getting the 32gb version? Don't. The 16gb is just fine  - for applications you won't need more. Multi-tasking is very easy and truly mastered on the iPad as opposed to the relevance on an iPod or iPhone courtesy of the big screen. Yes there is no flash support so I can't watch imdb trailers directly on the iPad. I have found applications which allow me to download music directly for free on the iPad - I am sure you will too. Netflix works flawlessly on this. I have put 740 songs on it and three films and have 35 applications installed but I still have 3GB remaining. After watching this film once I delete it to keep it free for another. This way you won't need a bigger iPad but if you do the difference is just $100 + Tax. I have also found that there exist many solutions for iPad users to wirelessly connect the iPad with a wireless storage hard drive. The expansion options are super. So take a look into that but I strongly advise getting just the basic  16gb version. I have a 64 gb iPhone and 64gb iPod so maybe I am so adamant on the uselessness of a higher storage iPad too.\n\n10. Miscallenous - It works with bluetooth, the iPad is light, unique for browsing, unique for youtube, ultra fast, multitasking is beautiful, you can play music or pandora while browsing, you can also switch the screen off and it will continue singing to you for several hours, the battery life does justice to it's perfections, the cameras are ok, i never Skype using it or i don't use FaceTime cause I don't know many people who do that. I like to carry it in my 13inch laptop case logic bag when I have to. I haven't dropped much water on it because i like it too much to be clumsy  with it. No headphones or instruction manual is  shipped. It took me roughly 30 minutes to set it up by connecting  with my mac.  It comes with a decent amount of charge so you can go 4 hours of playing around with it right out the box.\n\nI want you to look at all the above mentioned points and ask yourself if this is a notebook replacement? Obviously not. Because it has no physical keyboard, hdmi out, usb slot but if you are a casual browser, you can invest in this first and use it within the first 30 days to make your mind up. Apple is good that way. Overall - this is by far the best device i have ever used. It beats my iPod, iPhone, android phone, old blackberry, my mac desktop (close  2nd) , my ASUS laptop, my tv, my xbox, my blu ray player, my cameras and even my iron. Good luck. Don't buy the white one, get the black one."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "If you still on the fence on what tablet to purchase, play it safe and buy an Ipad 2.  The experience is much more enjoyable over all.  This is a non-biased review, I own a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 as well (I may even be more of a fanboy toward Samsung, owning a 3d Blu ray player, 3D Led and LCD tv).  In my opinion, what makes the Ipad better than any of the Android tablets is the apps.  Apples app store has more apps than the Android market has to offer.  The Apple app store is also better looking and more organized (Android is getting better though).  Everything is clearly labeled for what device ie Ipad or Iphone/Itouch.  On the Android market its hard to tell whats what.  I have downloaded many apps that are intended for a phone.  I downloaded Guitar Hero 5 from the Android market and playing it was unbearable due to the tiny screen size, there was no option to enlarge the screen (Android needs to do a software update for this asap).  If you have a favorite Itouch game that you wanted to play on a bigger screen you can with the Ipad, you can increase the screen size).  In my opinion developers of apps are clearly making them first on Ipad.  For example, Netflix, Face Book, Onlive, and Boxee.  I would love to have a offical Face Book app for my Galaxy Tab. There is a Face Book app for Android but its ment for a phone and looks terrible on a tablet.  Why does it take so long for android to get them?  Even similar apps for both apple and android look better on Ipad, words with friends and Amazon Shopping app for starters!  Amazon you NEED to give Android the same app you gave Apple!  The one on my GT sucks.  Apple even has more demos of games...there usually called something like lite or free.  Apple has airplay which is cool if you own a AppleTV, I can play Angry Birds on my Samsung 3D LED 55 inch TV!  Yes Samsung has AllShare (Samsungs version of AirPlay) but for some stupid reason the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 doesnt have that app!  Why in the world does the first generation have it but the new one doesnt?  You cant even download it off the Samsung App store, maybe its coming w/Ice Cream Sandwich??  Heres basically my pros and cons for the Ipad:\n\nPros\nEasy to use\nTons of Apps and better looking ones\nAirplay\nWay more accessaries and Cases (Im still waiting for a OtterBox case for my GT)\n\nCons\nNo flash\nVery controlled device and you cant customize it like Android\n\nHeres a couple of things that I like better on the Galaxy tab.  On paper the GTs specs are better than Ipad 2.  You can customize it just about any way you want...but you need to be a lil tech savy.  Just about every game on Android is free and and they are full games (with ads)  Everyday Amazon gives you a free app!\nThere is more than one market place to shop from (Android Market, Amazon, Samsung etc.)  Youtube looks cooler on Android...love the 3d honey comb looks!"}

I, like a lot of other sheep, went out and quickly spent about $650 on this thing. Then I was told by Apple,for an additional $150 I could get two years worth of technical support which I gladly gave up. What they did not tell me was that I would have to be on a complete LEARNING CURVE( which they did not even understand themselves!) to use this product. First, let me say, don't waste your money on any Apple technical support gimmicks. I had some valuable notes stored on my Ipad 2 to do a convention with about three days before this happened. I went to Apple technical support because my e-mail did not work on my Ipad 2. Then they instructed me on how to delete my notes and \"wake up my e-mail\". I said, \"won't I lose all my notes?\" She said \"No, one has nothing to do with the other\". My response was \"Are you sure? I really need these notes for my speaking engagement at the convention\". She said \"No way you'll lose anything. Trust me\". What she should have said is: \"I'm an Apple tech support person, who gets paid by the hour, and it's no skin off my nose if you lose your notes or not!\". And that's exactly what happened. As per her instruction....I lost all of them. I was devastated. I had to spend days,scrambling to recovering at lease some of my lost notes. I will never get back what I lost...ever. I didn't know that everything on an Ipad 2 had had to be backed up to a REAL COMPUTER(notice I said: REAL COMPUTER). I was never told this. Now, that there have been so many failures and complaints about this product I understand they've created a thing called \"cloud\", which does the same thing....backs up your files. You will do better to buy a smaller version of a laptop and don't fall for the nonsense,like I did, that this is a great buy.....because it's not.\nWondering if my e-mail was ever fixed? After spending six hours on the phone with Apple and completely losing my notes and going through the process to \"restart\" my e-mail 6 times..... guess what? It still doesn't work!!! If Apple tech support is the standard for which other companies should model themselves,then we have NO STANDARD. I feel very ripped off."}

The iPad camera's resolution is not great when zooming way in on a subject, but I didn't really expect the iPad to replace a good quality hand-held digital camera anyway.

Nonetheless, ever since I got the iPad, I have been using it for a range of tasks, focusing mainly on reading magazines and books. I travel often, and the iPad allows have everything I might want to read on a trip in one, which also happens to be lighter and more compact than most books out there. The only drawback is that typing on this machine is slow since you have to keep an eye on the keyboard at all times, but this holds true for all other tablets, and its easily fixed by purchasing an external keyboard if typing is essential to you. A must have accessory for this item is some sort of protective case. I have two, apple's sponsored screen protector (which conveniently locks the ipad when shut), and a sleeve for traveling, so that I can easily put it in my backpack when traveling."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Let me start out by saying, I am neither a Apple Fanboy, nor a pro-Windows person.  I have a Windows phone paired with a Mac computer.  So, I generally buy products based on the product rather than the company. At first, I was completely against getting an iPad, since I figured that my Mac could do anything that my phone couldn't. I broke down my favorite aspects and least favorite aspects of the iPad 2 (not software, but hardware):\nFavorites:\n1) The weight distribution of the tablet: It doesn't seem to be too heavy, or too light (as in cheap).\n2) Materials: I was leaning more toward a Android tablet, but the materials that went into those felt so cheap to me. The iPad 2 has a great aluminum feel to the back, with a glossy front.  I miss the Gorilla Glass of my Samsung phones though, since I never needed a screen protector.\n3) Everything just works:  If you have ever had an Android phone, you understand what I mean. Occasionally, the Android OS just freezes, or crashes (at least on my previous phone).  When you press the home button, there is no lag.  This has more to do with the software of the iPad (iOS 5). True, it is more of a restricted OS than the Android OS, but its a sacrifice I was willing to make.\n4) The prestige that comes with an iPad:  This may sound shallow, but I didn't not want to have to defend my position of getting an Android tablet over an iPad.  This holds its value long into the future, verses lesser known Android tablets.\n5) Clean lines:  A minimalistic design.  Clean cut, very stylish.\n\nLeast Favorite:\n1) True, the iPad is very balanced, but it does get heavy when reading after awhile.  If you are looking for an ereader and won't be going into the features of the iPad, then don't buy it.  Buy the Kindle Fire or another device.\n2) Every accessory seems to be (excluding a few of course) very expensive.  If you want a good deal, you have to be willing to hunt for awhile, buy used, or pony up the extra money to buy the protective case, or screen protector, etc.\n3) I still feel nervous carrying it around with me. Its a double edge sword... yes, I love the prestige that comes with the ipad, but so do the thieves.\n\nOverall, this review isn't going to make someone who doesn't want one, buy an iPad.  What I must say is: if you have never used an iPad, don't hate on iPad owners.  After using this for awhile, I can't understand my hesitation at first to buy one, or why I waited so long.\nAdvice: rumors are swirling about the next iPad (claims to be iPad 3). Do your research on the rumors or wait, so that you can buy the most up to date out there."}

Not only did Apple lose my backup during the update (causing me to restore the whole \"system\" from scratch), but now it runs EVEN SLOWER than the last iOS 4 update.\n\n  Hasn't anyone else noticed this?\n\nWhen I updated it to iOS 5, I said to myself, \"If iOS 5 runs even slower or causes any other problems, I'm going to throw this thing out the window. Well, not going to do this, but I'm REALLY going to recommend AGAINST the iPAD to anyone interested in getting one. Can't take iPad or iPod seriously--even for music since I'm still trying to fit all the music I had on the iPad before which I can't fit now, after restore. And I can't put music on my iPad OR iPod Touch which resides on an external flash drive, which iTunes CAN play, but my iPad and iPod Touch cannot.  And iTunes syncing is all screwed up. Choose the wrong option and IT WILL DELETE all your music, apps, photos, etc.  NOT like it used to BE.  ;...(\n\nAND...I hate touch screens. Ironically, you CAN'T touch them. (As MC Hammer once sung, \"Can't touch this.\") Any slight brush with a stray finger makes it do something you don't want it to do.\n\nAND it doesn't run FLASH (Apple doesn't allow it), so I can't watch FLASH-based videos or see anyone type of FLASH-based web content on an iPad.\n\nNo more iPads, no more iPods (we have 2 iPads and several iPods) and no more updates (unless totally desperate)!

I also put some educational apps for my 2 year-old son and he loves them too.  The speed is great (no lag time opening and closing apps, safari, photos, and anything else).

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "My husband ordered this item (iPad 2, 16gb, black) for work. He loves it. We still have been unable to update it to iOS 5 because our wifi kept disconnecting on wifi on laptop but I think when we do that it will be faster. First day he had some slowness but not everything is great. We looked at getting some of the tablets on the android market and went to best buy to review. I liked the idea because the androids are more customizable but had reservations because 1. They are about the same price as iPads 2. Wasn't sure if I wanted to take that risk. 3. I have iPhones and know how dependable they are. However I found the toshiba thrive and it was cheaper. So that was our main focus. Toshiba thrive vs. iPad 2. On one hand the toshiba had USB ports, sd card ports and customization options, on the other if was not familiar with it. So we tried them both at best buy. Toshiba thrive looked better. It's graphics looked more fun, apps are cheaper..mostly free and all that. But it was more complicated, which i love because I like to tween things. My husband on the other hand...does not. So he wanted iPad...I wanted toshiba thrive but we wanted to talk to somebody who knew more about it. So we grabbed a guy who only deals with tablets. He said he has an android phone and likes it but as far as tablets go he said hands down iPad won. Reason was that apple makes one specific hardware for iPads. So they had it perfected. All their apps and music were specifically made for apple hardware so it had very little problems. Android market on the other hand is made from many different tablets, that are all made by different hardware. Therefore, if an app is made on a toshiba thrive, it may work great, but if you download it for your samsung thrive, the hardware is different so you are going to have more freezes with all, crashes or lack of working at all.\n\nIn conclusion, iPad 2 so far is more dependable and perfected. I do believe however, with time, the android market will be more perfected. As of now, I am siticking with my iPad 2!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I'm not an Apple fan by any means of the imagination, but I have to admit that I do own quite a few of their devices.  I learned my lesson to pick and choose what I feel most comfortable using and to not be so stubborn about supporting a company that I dislike.  I should say the only thing I dislike about Apple is their computer operating system.  It's not an operating system for me.  I don't feel comfortable using it and it is definitely much more boring than using a Windows operating system that has a gazillion more software written for it.  I'm a Windows guy, grew up with Windows and dabbled with Linux.  I tried to jump on to Linux band wagon long time ago and attempted to stick to it.  It was after several years that I realized Linux was likely not going ANYWHERE on the consumer side for the foreseeable future.  Linux will always be known as a great server operating system, reliable SAMBA share server, etc, but it will never surpass Windows or OS X.  Even Mac/OS X is popular among the consumers and look what this operating system is built on top of!\n\n  That being said, it does me no good to hate Apple just because I feel like it.  I bought their iPad 2 device and have been using it since it's initial launch (I did not buy it the first day of launch online, but definitely 3-4 days afterwards).  This device has been great since I purchased it the first day.  Yes, it does not support FLASH, but I realized this before I decided to buy the iPad.  The screen is sharp, the performance is fast and the screen touch is extremely responsive.  The battery life is really good compared to other devices (e.g. iPhone 4s, iPhone 3Gs).  It is a device for casual usage, you browse, you email, you do stuff for leisure.  I sometimes forget to connect the iPad to the charger over night, but I have not had to charge this device for 2-4 days, depending on how heavy I use it.  It's not like the iPhone where I MUST recharge it each night or else it will DEFINITELY run down the battery to critical level.  Granted, it's the WiFi version so it does not have the techno-complication of having to deal with 3G.  iPad 2 is very stable and robust.  I am definitely the type of person who would take every opportunity to criticize an Apple device, but I have to admit that I have had absolutely no problems using this iPad device.  I have no experience with any other tablet device in the market, but if you are wondering if you should get one or if this is going to be a reliable device, I can definitely say it has been super reliable in all phase it was made for since I received it.  Again, it does NOT support Flash, so be aware of this before you purchase it.  It's light weight, does a LOT of tasks that you can do from a computer and has a whole ton of apps available.\n\n  If you want to compare it to a computer, don't try to completely compare it apples to apples (pun intended), because it still isn't as \"flexible\" as a computer.  My laptop has a built in physical keyboard and mouse, I do not have to purchase a separate keyboard or mouse like I would have to for a iPad (you have to use the virtual keyboard on the iPad).  I can truly multitask on my Windows laptop, on the iPad it's \"semi-multitask\" at most.  The iPad cannot come close to the laptop's 8GB memory, 750 GB hard drive laptop that can run VMWare, play online multi-player games, store files where-ever I want, in whatever directory I created.  There are SO many things I can do on a laptop that the iPad currently cannot do... so unless you ONLY browse, type a few emails, make a few purchases from Amazon/eBay or other available stores and maybe chat occasionally online... then don't expect this iPad to really replace a laptop or desktop (I'm typing this review via laptop as it faster to do than on an iPad).\n\n  One negative about the iPad, but it's not Apple's fault, the Apps that people sell may be written for the iPad only or for iPhone only but sometimes written for both.  This means that if the app was designed specifically for the iPhone and you buy it... then it will not LOOK optimized for the iPad since the screen size on the iPad will make it stretched.  If you purchase the app for the iPad, then it may not even be available for the iPhone (I haven't seen an app for the iPad available for the iPhone).  Often they sell TWO different versions of the same app for both devices, so you have to pay double the amount to use them on your two devices.  Again, this review is about the iPad device, not about how the apps are developed, so overall, the iPad 2 is awesome... highly recommended for a tablet purchase."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I'm a long time Android phone user, but I decided to give Apple a try when it came to a tablet.\n\nIn trying out different tablets in person, I found most of the Android tablets to be either too heavy and/or bulky, or cheap feeling.\n\nI also found Android 3.x (Honeycomb) to be difficult to use, and the tablets with Android 2.x just looking like a phone under a magnifying glass.  The Motorola Xoom appeared to be very well built, but a little on the heavy side.\n\nWhen I tried an ipad after sifting through the sea of Android tablets at the local electronics store, I was sold instantly.  The user interface is so smooth and simple compared to Android.  I also knew that Apple products are typically less buggy than Android.  I've had a lot of difficulties with the bugginess of all my Android phones.  I may have been more courageous to try an Android tablet if more of them had support from Cyanogenmod.  As of now, there are only two Android tablets (not great ones) that they officially support.  Android 4.0 is coming soon, and looks promising, but that's yet to be seen.\n\nThe ipad is so smooth to the touch, and so comfortable in the hands... it's competitors are no match in initial impressions.\n\nAfter having plenty of time to play with it, I have mixed feelings about it.\n\nThere are some drawbacks.  Every time you download something from itunes (including music, videos, apps, and books) it asks for your password (if you haven't entered it in the last 15 minutes).  It even asks for your password when downloading free items.  I understand that this was a measure to stop children from running up bills on their parents accounts, but I don't have children, and there is no way to disable this feature.\n\nIn the appstore, there are a lot of free apps, but I feel there are many more for free in the Android market.  I like free apps.  I don't like paying huge costs for hardware, then still having to pay for every little thing I need it to do.  But that appears to be the case here.  I have found some cool stuff for free, though.  It's just riddled with ads.\n\niOS 5.0... I guess that's the big thing right now, but I'm not that excited about it.  My ipad shipped with 4.3 and I could barely tell the difference after the update.  If they were trying to gain Android's strengths with that update, they FAILED.  iOS defnitely does have it's own strengths, though.\n\nI am absolutely astonished at the battery life on the ipad.  I can play games all night, while connected to wifi, and occasionally streaming videos... and by some miracle, I still have plenty of battery life left.  My phone (Motorola Droid 3) would not stand for this... it's dead as a doornail before I get to 3 hours of playing games on it.\n\nI previously owned a Kindle 3 e-reader, which persuaded me that paper books were still the best way to go.\n\niBooks changed my mind!  NO EXTERNAL LIGHT NEEDED! Unlike the Kindle or Nook.  You can read in the dark without disturbing your bedmate.  It actually looks and acts like an open book, too!  I'm so excited about that.  When you flip the page, you literally touch the edge of the page on the screen and flip it like a book's page!  The screen is very sharp, and brightness is adjustable to levels that are tolerable in the dark or in bright sunlight.  Honestly, it's completely worth being 3 times the cost of a Kindle just as an e-reader.\n\nInternet browsing is terrific.  Much better than I ever expected from a mobile device.  All this bickering about iOS not using flash... it must be old news.  I've loaded flash content on both Safari and the Dolphin browser (from the app store).  What's more... flash appears to be smoother on my ipad than on my flash supported Droid 3.\n\nAlso worth noting, the ipad docks to my car stereo just like my ipod classic does.  The stereo is able to maintain control over it just as it does an ipod (I read mixed reviews about this functionality).  The surprising thing... the stereo also charges the ipad (although, I believe it's at a slower rate).\n\nAll in all, the ipad is great, but I still feel the pinch of the lack of customization that I've enjoyed with Android.  In physical form, it has no competitor.  I'm happy with my purchase.\n\nCyanogenmod! This is a call for a port! Dual boot!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I first bought a Viziotab Android tablet from Costco, then my friend bought an iPad.  Not to be outdone, I bought an iPad as well.  Now I thought I'd be using my iPad more than my Android, but this has turned out not to be the case.  You see,  Android and iPad are two very different devices, with one device often doing things much better than the other one.  So I've found myself using each device for different purposes, and I've found my Android device to be much more practical for everyday use.\n\nHere's a summary of my findings over two weeks of using both devices:\n\nOS Stability:  The winner here is the iPad.  I've experienced occasional freezes on the Android tablet, along with delays and slowdowns.  The only delay I've experienced on the iPad is when I'm using Safari and want to type in an address in the address bar.  There is a small delay from when I type the 'www' to when it shows up on the screen.  No big deal.\n\nCamera:  iPad is far and away the winning choice here, especially since my Android device came with a shabby VGA camera.  I can't speak for other devices like Galaxy Tab, but the iPad with its front and rear facing cameras definitely wins.\n\nVideo Chat:  iPad.  Especially since my Android tablet doesn't, as yet, support this.\n\nScreen Resolution:  iPad.  What can I say about this, other than the difference is like night and day.  The Viziotab's screen resolution is, in a word, ugly.  It seems very one-dimensional compared to the iPad's.  The iPad screen is clear, bright, and attractive.\n\nBrowsing:  I'm going to give this one to Android.  Although iPad's browsing is fast and Safari is easy to use, Android has flash.  Yes, I know, the resource hogging flash!  But here's the thing about flash for me: There are a couple of mission-critical websites I use constantly  one is for my job) that use flash.  With the iPad, it's a no go -- unless you buy a third-party browser that supports flash.  So Android wins here.\n\nPhotos:  This is a toss up.  While iPad blows away Viziotab in terms of resolution, Android wins simply because you don't need to go through iTunes to sync your photo library.  I think I'll be using my iPad to share those photos from my recent trip to Hawaii, but if I need to 'manage' my photos I'll use my Android tablet.\n\nVideo:  Again, a toss up.  iPad presents videos beautifully, but management is a pain in the a**.  First, iPad doesn't support all video formats.  And second, you have to sync your videos through iTunes.  So, if I have that iPad-compatible video of my trip to Egypt, I'll share it on iPad -- otherwise I'll be using my Android tablet to manage my video collection.\n\nEmail: I was at first impressed by the iPad email app.  But I enjoy reading my email on Android.  Perhaps it's the Android's integrated GMail app, which makes viewing email a more pleasant experience.  iPad just seems awkward.  Android wins here.\n\nDownloading:  No contest here.  Android wins.  You can download anything to an Android tablet, including video and audio in multiple formats.  Android supports torrent downloading, too.  What can you download to iPad?  iTunes apps, music, and video, all of which come at a price.\n\nGames:  iPad wins.  I just can't see Android competing in this area.  Although I'm not a big mobile-device gamer, so it doesn't really matter to me.\n\nBluetooth connectivity:  iPad supports Apple devices.  Android supports everyone's devices.  Android wins.\n\nApps:  A toss up.  App store wins for number of apps, and for integration with iPad.  Market wins for functionality.  I like ebooks, for example, and have ebooks with Barnes and Noble and Kindle.  But Apple has hamstrung the Nook and Kindle apps buy taking away the ability to download books through the iPad apps.  And there will be no app available through the app store that duplicates any other functionality that would eat iinto Apple's profits.\n\nViewing Videos on your HDTV:  With the purchase of a $5 HDTV cable I can view beautiful, high resolution movies and TV shows on my HDTV with my Viziotab.  With iPad you have to buy Apple TV ($99) and then are limited to iTunes store purchases.  Viziotab is the winner here.\n\nIn conclusion, I like the iPad for its big, beautiful display and ease of use.  I don't like it for its limitations, like lack of bluetooth connectivity, file management capability, and file format support.  I will keep my iPad to share videos and photos of vacations, and to use if I have to video conference with someone.  Which will probably be never, but at least it's there!  And for the cool apps that I do like.  Not so much for browsing or file management.  If I were to have to choose between the two, I would choose Android simply because it is wide open compared to iPad. If I sit on the couch to surf, I'll use Android because I know there will be no artificial barrier between me and the world wide web.  And if I go on vacation, I will take the Android with me for compatibility reasons.\n\nBuying advice:\n\n If you're an Apple user already and are immersed in the Apple ecosystem of products and services, compatibility probably is not an issue for you, so I would choose iPad.  If, however, you're not an Apple user I would carefully weigh the compatibility issues.  The iPad effect wears off eventually, and you have to realize the iPad is a device that does some things really well, other things not so well, and a few things not at all.  If those things it does 'not at all' are things you need it to do, then you might be well advised to get one of the Android tablets to better serve your needs.  Or, if you're like me and can afford it, why not get both?"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Everyone was at awe and full of excitement when the Apple iPad 2 was announced, but how does it really stand up to the competition and is it worth the upgrade? Now that it has been released for six months and I own one, along with the first generation iPad and a HP Touchpad. I feel I am one person that can give a fair review of the item. Examining how the iPad 2 is an improvement over the original on the outside, inside, and how it compares to the Touchpad in terms of hardware and software is a great way to show why the iPad 2 is worth buying.\n When first grasping the iPad 2, you notice it is much thinner than the iPad 1. It is approximately the same thickness as a simple pencil; you may ask how does it not break? Well it is construced of aluminum on the back and gorilla glass on the front. The gorilla glass in the iPad 2 is double the strength of the similar type of glass used in the first generation iPad. The testers at the website Gizmodo.com compared these two pieces of glass with two pieces of wood and bending the glass between them. The iPad 2 glass stretched twice as far before breaking.  The glass is not perfect though, it will break it dropped without a case because it is indeed glass. Unlike the iPad 1, the iPad 2 has special tiny magnets built in around the screen that allows Apple's new product the smart cover to be usable. The cover sticks to the iPad 2 and wakes up the iPad when the cover is removed. This interesting feature is a feature not available with the first iPad. The screen size and resolution is the same as the original iPad, with a 9.7\" IPS technology screen and a 1024x768 resolution. A new addition to the iPad 2 is the cameras on both the front and the back of the device. The front facing camera, similar to that of the one in the Apple iPhone 4 is mainly used for skype and video conversations. The camera on the back is a low one megapixel camera, and is quite grainy. I cannot imagine anyone having a use for this and I myself have never found a use for it. It still is better than the originals iPad's though, since it does not even have a camera.  The iPad 2 can also be bought in the color white, unlike the original. I bought my iPad 2 from Apple.com the night it was available and got it in a few days with free shipping.\nThe internals have gone through a drastic change between the two iPads. Apple, along with every other technology giant upgrades their devices to meet the latest technology. Apple has shown this by upgrading from the slower A4 single-core processor in the original iPad to the faster and much smoother dual-core A5 processor found in the iPad 2. The random access memory or RAM has been doubled between the two devices from 256 megabytes to 512 megabytes. The RAM upgrade allows more webpages to be open simultaneously in applications such as skyfire and safari. On the original iPad if you open ten pages at once, the device is quite slow and can even become unresponsive; on the new iPad ten pages is no problem, with no slowdowns. The speakers are the same in both iPad's, although the placement of them is a bit different. The hard drive storage options are the same in both devices, depending on how much you need. Available options are as low as 16GB to as high as 64GB. The video memory has also been upgraded in the iPad 2, allowing games such as Infinity Blade to run quickly and look much better, more realistic even. The figures in Infinity Blade look more closely to real humans than those shown on the first iPad. Overall it is good upgrade to the original in my opinion, since the price of the two is the same starting out.\nKnowing the iPad 2 is a good improvement over the original, how does it compare to similar tablet computers in the market? I own an HP Touchpad which is a similar tablet and it is a close comparison. The Touchpad features the same type of display, sporting a 9.7\" IPS technology screen just as the iPad 2. I consider the two being a tie in this category, because there really is not much of a difference. When it comes to overall shape the Touchpad is shorter than the iPad but the same width. I do not see this as being much of a difference either. The iPad 2 is considerably lighter than the touchpad it feels like, this should not matter too many people, the difference is not to major, and with a case the weight equals out. The touchpad has smaller hard drive options than the iPad 2; having only 16GB and 32GB options. I do not know many people that would use the full 64GB of data that can be bought in an iPad 2, but if you need that much than the iPad 2 would be the device to go with. Both my iPad 2 and touchpad have 16GB of data and I do not find myself looking for more space at all. My original iPad has 64GB of data and if I did not put my movies on it, I would have no use for the full 64GB. The camera comparison between the iPad 2 and the touchpad is another tie. While the touchpad only has one, front facing camera, it is of a much higher quality than both of the cameras on the iPad 2. Since the touchpad does not have a camera on the back and iPad 2 does, I give them a tie.  The touchpad has a dual-core processor, just as the iPad 2, but it is .2 gigahertz faster. The .2 gigahertz does not seem to make much of a difference, but since the speed is clocked faster, I give this to the touchpad. The battery life on the touchpad is very close to that of both iPad's. I do not notice much faster drainage between the three devices. A notable difference in the two devices is the speaker quality. The iPad 2 has decent speakers but not the best on the market; on the other hand, the touchpad uses higher quality beats audio, which is argued as some of the best on the market in 2011. It shows this, the sound quality on any music is like comparing static to clear, smooth sound between the two devices.  When it comes to price, originally they were both tied at $499 for the base price, but now the touchpad has been lowered to an extremely good, low price of $99. If you are on a budget and want a nice tablet, the touchpad is for you.\nWhen it comes to software, I have to say the iPad 2 dominates this category all around. The touchpad, which runs on WebOS is a system that does not have near the developers or supporters that the iPad 2 and the app store has. The app store has well over 500,000 applications that can be downloaded for free, or for a small fee to the iPad, whereas the touchpad has only a few 1,000. This attracts many more people to the iPad 2 because there is many more applications for anything you can think of in the app store, the selection of apps is very limited if you are buying the touchpad. If you are using a phone as a main internet connection, you will notice trouble when trying to connect the touchpad to the internet; this is because the touchpad does not support ad-hoc networks. This is a downfall for people like me that live on the iPhone internet tethering; the iPad 2 does support these networks and has no trouble connecting. For most people this will not be an issue but it something that should be known and that I was not aware of when I bought the touchpad. When using the touchpad, it is just as fluid as the iPad 2 when it comes to scrolling between pages of applications and searching through the device.  WebOS itself is not a bad system to use, and if it had more applications I believe it would be a great system.\nIf you are stuck on deciding a tablet computer to buy, ask yourself what you are expecting. If you want just a simple tablet computer, with no cameras, lots of apps and good ability to function, the iPad 1 would be good. Although if you want a nice, newer tablet with a camera you have to decide how much your budget is? The iPad 2 and the touchpad are close in mostly every category besides the selection of apps, is the price difference of $400 worth the app store? I myself believe the iPad 2 is a wonderful device to have and use if your budget can afford it, otherwise I would highly recommend the $99 HP touchpad."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Pros: The iPad 2 is by the best selling tablet out there. Comparing to other tablets the ipad 2 is far more efficient and worth every penny. You have a front facing webcam to chat with all your facetime buddies and if you have an application you can even chat with android users as well! The touch screen is both elegant and accurate to the exact point of your finger. Also with the new A5 dual-core 1Gz processor this will surpass any applications. However im telling you all the pros about the product and I'm not one of those all out apple fan boys I believe every device out there has a purpose but some are more worthwhile for your money.\n\nCons: Despite all the good looks and great hardware and software the device is fragile and you must buy a case for it or its prone to scratches unlike most android device they have a much more durable glass one known as gorilla glass. Also the camera isn't even barely a megapixel the quality of the images are horrible and you have a vga front facing camera.\n\nOverall: this is a great buy because the amount of application offered from apple's App Store benefits you more than Androids app store. I have to admit apple's app store has a higher quality of apps and a lot better utilities and such. I use this alot for school so its the perfect tablet to use a researching tool and typing up notes and organizing my work."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I did my homework & spent months comparing tablets & laptops against the iPad2. Due to life taking it's own twist s & turns I was going to have to put off my purchase until next year. My boy friend bought me a poleroid e-reader 2 weeks ago to get me out of the living room after he went to sleep for the reading light as I'm addicted to everything Terry Prachet. Needless to say, while I was happy to be in our bedroom the e-reader is very limited in it's format & unless you know what your reading by heart your going to get lost thanks to missing text. Of course I am very thankful that he wanted to be generous & tried to be helpful but he knew I was unimpressed. So two days ago I was woken up to close my eyes & hold out my hands. He bought me the iPad2! The camera's are awesome, the size is twice as big yet the same weight as the e-reader. The already installed apps are great & navigating app store is so easy, let alone almost every site online that I have been to so far (20 of my favorite online news, shopping, weather etc.) already has a free app for the iPad2. There are a few interesting quirks though...\n\n1) You must have a pc to install the operating system through I tunes, but you can also go to an Apple store & they will help you.\n2) While it comes already installed with a YouTube app the videos aren't the best versions (due to their FLASH) but you do get the site, with most videos & songs.\n3) Apple IPad2 is not compatible with adobe FLASH... Not on the apps or if you just use the safari operating system to connect to the browser of your choice.\n4) No more zynga games, (Mafia Wars etc.) on Facebook if this will be your only mode of internet connection.\n5) The apps pages are in most cases very cool & graphically stimulating, however I am learning going to the same site using safari will have different content. In the case of Facebook, I couldn't view the links posted by my friends to my wall when using the Facebook app.\n6) The yahoo messenger app takes up the entire iPad screen & I tended to forget it was signed on to learn I was missing conversations due to web browsing... or sitting around waiting for a response.\n\nThe iPad has made the last 2 days of after dinner family movies more tolerable, as the toddlers can watch their Disney movies. While I enjoy Netflix on the couch, they sung & danced to their hearts desires without me getting frustrated that I can't see Eric & Arial get thrown out of the boat for the 5 billionth time. Bed time has been fun for us all, as they are amazed I read them a color book (The little engine that could... Free in I-books) up in thier bedroom on my, \"tiny nooooooo touchy TV\".\n\nI LOVE MY IPAD2!!!! None of the aforementioned quirks are irritating enough to walk away, just things I don't know enough about or need to get used to. Considering the auto spell hasn't inspired me t9, I mean *59... ugh! Hasn't made me throw it out the window yet. But I can turn it off in the settings, which is a really cool feature with all kinds of settings & features I haven't fully jumped into yet.  You can buy the 500gb wifi external hard drive to store your movies & video's on, (as it's not expandable) plus share ability with up to 2 or 3 others, at the same time. So really it's only draw back is the whole Adobe Flash issue or I would think it is absolutely perfect!\n\nI knowI will go back to using my laptop from time to time, but right now I am so excited & inspired to find all the ways I can enjoy & use this clever machine it's going to be a while."}

Ok....then buy an iPod Touch and write letters, and read articles and/books, watch videos, etc. on that tiny little screen. One of the major points of the iPad is it's larger screen!!  Some guy wrote about how the iPad sucks because of fingerprints on the screen. Really??? He must have filthy fingers!! When using my iPad I don't ever see fingerprints that get in the way of using the device. Oh sure, I see them when the unit is OFF, and then I wipe it clean if needed. But when it's on?? Please.\nThe iPad can be used for almost anything we normal people do- reading, entertainment, shopping, surfing the web. No flash?? True....but really, there are not that many instances that pop up where the lack of Flash is a problem. If it were a real problem, then Apple would not have sold tens of millions of the device thus far. I don't know about others but I know my company switched their entire website to one with HTML 5- good bye Flash. I'm guessing that's going to happen more and more. It has no USB or video out ports?? Ok....then don't buy it! It's amusing how people \"purchase\" the iPad and then moan and complain that it has no USB port or HDMI out ports. Really? You mean....you didn't know that when you bought it?\n  Seriously, some of the naysayers for this product that say \"it sucks\" and so on are clueless. This is a FANTASTIC product! Ok....so it IS a little pricey, I'll given them that. But then, so is the Galaxy Tab. Most products of this type that cost much less simply are not worth it. Maybe the Kindle Fire will be? Who knows?

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Ok, my wife got the black 16GB several months ago and I inherited a Nook Color which I though would be good enough to use for surfing the web, email, editing and publishing documents, etc...  and after several months of frustration, and seeing how well that iPad 2 worked, I decided to get myself one.\n\n*WOW*\n\nI'm not trying to bash the Nook Color, it is nice for reading magazines and books, not as pleasing on the eyes as the larger iPad 2 screen, but it works.  It's probably more of the limitations of the Android OS that is so frustrating to me, and the lack of real world applications for it.  Yes it has an abundance of applications, but no real apps to do work it seems.\n\niPad 2 has apps like Pages and Numbers that integrate seamlessly with their counterparts on the computer.  On the other hand Android devices have something called Quickoffice PRO which is supposed to allow you to edit and transfer Office documents between the device and the desktop...  sounds good, but after paying $14.00 for the app I cannot use ANY document with ANY type of formatting on the Android, and the smaller screen makes it hardly usable.  In contrast the only issues I have with Pages is if there is a font that is not available on the iPad, but is on the desktop computer, and I can always find another one that will fit the bill.\n\nThe iPad 2 is way ahead of Androids in terms of touchscreen recognition.  The Android was constantly doing things that I didn't want it to do.  For instance I would be attempting to scroll the screen and often times it would instead select an item or link from the screen.  That was uber-frustrating at best.  Trying to do anything on it was a labor of love I guess.  I oft times just got frustrated and moved to a computer to get something done.  The iPad by contrast seems to know exactly whatI am trying to do...  rarely do I have a touchscreen error.\n\nThe iPad 2 is sleek, elegant, and has a large enough screen to actually get some work done.  Surfing the web is a breeze and despite the complaints about the lack of a flash plug-in, I surf with relative ease.  Speaking of flash, yes Androids have that, but it doesn't work very well on them.  I struggled on web sites with flash on my Android.  Often times the page would not display correctly anyway, so that's kind of a wash.  And Microsoft is canning flash in Windows 8 as well.  It looks like Steve was right... flash is going away.\n\niOS 5 with iCloud is an iDream (pun intended).  I can sync all my contacts, my wife's contacts, calendars, Aperture photos, etc...  without any real user interaction.  Just turn the services on and go.  Makes me re-think that OS X Lion Server purchase I made, but I still need that for the older Macs running Tiger and Leopard on my network, and at some point I will probably turn on that XSAN server to create a local SAN RAID...\n\nNumbers files work perfectly and seamlessly between the iPad 2 and the desktop computer, formulas, etc.  That's another problem I had with the Android Quickoffice, it would not understand complex and sometimes simple formulas, so I couldn't use spreadsheets on it at all.\n\nGenerally the applications for iOS are far more mature and polished than those available for Android.  The user experience is without a doubt far superior on the iPad 2, apps like Hulu Plus were not even available on the Android which sort of left me scratching my head.  I do have an Android phone that has Hulu Plus on it, so I'm not certain why there wasn't one for the tablet, but it rendered what could have been a nice TV show watching device into a useless for TV device.\n\niPad 2 is sleek, sexy, stylish, yes.  But it is also a serious workhorse if you are like me and want to do real world work on it.  With a combination of the iPad, and iWork.com I am able to create documents on the iPad or desktop computer, save them to iWork.com, and download them anywhere in any of three possible formats (Pages, PDF, or Word).  The translation to word documents is nearly as flawless as the other transfers, again, sometimes there is a font issue, but that is rare and is easy to fix.\n\nAnother problem I had with the Android was the lack of iTunes for it.  Much of my music library is still DRM protected and the Android wouldn't play those files.  iPad 2 by contrast sync's right up and has every one of my songs available to play, and speaking of iCloud -- I have more computers than I need, and having that many leads to problems like the old \"you can only have 5 computers authorized\" when I try to authorize another iTunes library to sync my music.  iCloud eliminates that problem, your new purchases automatically are downloaded from the cloud. And storage is not really an issue with iPad 2 specifically... get the Camera Adapter kit and you can use all the SD cards you want with it.\n\nBack to the iPad 2 - if you are looking to buy a tablet type of computer and are on the fence between an iPad and another, shall I say \"knock-off\", dig into the details.\n\nSome of the Androids may be better than the Nook Color in terms of power, response, screen size, etc... but none of them have a decent office suite or iTunes, they don't have as many accessories available for them, you'll have to use a variety of different services to get iCloud functionality, you cannot use iWork.com with them, Apps are not as abundant and generally are not as mature/polished, syncing with your desktop is a headache - if you can even get it to, etc...\n\nOverall this is one of the best, if not THE best Apple product available.  I have a lot of Apple products these days due to the ease of use, this one is one of the easiest to use and I HIGHLY recommend it!"}

It isn't all that great. You could get a good Android tablet for half the price of this. Even if you simply MUST have Apple products in your home, don't get this. iPod Touch is the same thing but smaller, and iPhone 4 is the same thing except for the ability to call, text, and having a smaller screen, which isn't that much of a disadvantage.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "...but I love it!\n\nI was skeptical at first for getting one because the specs didn't/doesn't seem to justify the price.  I have a laptop, desktop and a very good Android phone so I didn't really need this.  But I've owned many Apple products (Macs and iPods) too, but never an iOS device.  So, as a birthday gift, I wanted to splurge (haha).\n\nNot to sound like an Apple ad/fanboy (or SJ-RIP), but I do like its `convenience.' I like that I can `lounge' with this instead of being at my desktop, having to deal with the bulk of a laptop or the small size (and power) of my smartphone.  The touchscreen is very responsive and the image quality (be it pictures, web pages, video-especially HBO) is great.  There is little to understand or setup (except connecting it to your wifi, if you got a wifi only; if you know/use Apple, Android or Windows, you'll figure it out easily).  I got a 32 gig because I wasn't sure what my ratio would be for apps vs. media/pic content (even with Apple's cloud service).\n\nGranted, it has some limitations (be it lack of `flash,' getting used to the onscreen keyboard and some multi-tasking capabilities), but its conveniences do make up in its usefulness (that is, if you use it for web surfing, checking email, using apps, etc).  I've had to stop myself at times from saying `I'm doing those things on such a thin device'-haha.\n\nI'll say that this is a very good `half-top,' that is, half a desktop/laptop.  It isn't to replace my computer or smartphone, but I do find myself using this more in leisure than my actual computer (haha).  I know there are less expensive tablets and/or tablets with better software/hardware specs.  But this device is a delight to have when/if you don't want to use your smartphone or computer."}

I received the IPad 2 as a gift from my daughters.  When I first opened the IPad2, it was WOW.  Now that I have used it for 2 weeks, here is my opinion.  It SUCKS.  No offense to the IPad lovers.  Here are the reasons:\n\nThe IPad2 lists at $499 with a puny 16GB memory.  After you load a few apps, your memory is down to say 14 GB.  There is not much you can hold with only 14GB...music, videos, pictures nowadays eat up a ton of memory.  If you want a higher memory, you have to buy the 32 or 64GB, at $599, and $699 respectively.  And even so, the last time I had a 64GB storage capacity is when I had my Atari Computer back in the 80's (ok..i'm exaggerating..but you get the point).  Apple calls 64GB a progress?  And some people hail Steven Jobs as the great innovator?  This is going backwards in time.\n\nThe IPad storage capacity is NOT UPGRADABLE.  You have to sell the old one and buy a new one.  This is how Steve Jobs made a lot of money, off of a lot of unsuspecting customers.  What puzzles me is why do some continue to patronize such marketing program.\n\nThere are a few things you can do to overcome the small storage, such as, carry a bunch of SD cards, preload it with files and use the camera kit to view.  Some suggest using an external harddrive which you again have to preload with the files you intend to use.  Others suggest using online data storage which you have to pay, somewhere between $10-30/month, and mind you, you have to be online to access these files...so if you do not have WIFI or 3G access, you are SOL.\n\nIf I have to do the above to gain storage, what have I gained from IPad2?  I thought the IPad2 is about ease of portability?  Not to mention the additional money one has to spend on the additional accessories.\n\nThe 3G data capability adds $129 to the IPad2.  Bear in mind, you still have to subscribe to the 3G data.  If you are on the go, the 3G would be helpful.  However, the 3G is not all dependable depending on where you're at.  The 3G signals in China, Hongkong, and Macau were unreliable.  In mainland China, I was able to get \"some\" 3G data, but none is HongKong and Macau, even when there were strong signals....something to do with prioritization...they give their local subscribers priority, and you get the scrap signal (This is according to T-Mobile).  Maybe this only happens in China.\n\nIPad has NO ethernet cable connection.  While it appears that more and more places are now going WIFI, there are still a lot of good hotels using ethernet cables.  Sometimes you have to go to the lobby (a great inconvenience) to get your best WIFI signal (so, being able to use the ethernet cable in the room would be more convenient).  And there are still a few hotels that don't offer WIFI.  Then what?  You are SOL, unless you bring your own WIFI router.  So I ask again, if I have to bring a router for these rare occasions, am I not defeating the purpose of the ease of portability?\n\nThe IPad2 was not able to open a video clip from my Canon T2i (format is .mov).  Later I hear Ipad only supports apple video formats.  It does not run Flash based content.  It does not run Java.  What the?\n\nI still thank my daughters for gifting me the IPad2.  At the least it brought me up to date with technology...I know what I'm not missing...I can say I know what it is...and I can speak intelligently about the Ipad...it's overrated."}

Although I have multiple iPods and also an iPhone owner, this is the first time we are getting ourselves an iPad in the household.\n\nThis is wonderful device. Just like what they did in the IpodTouch, the amazing thing is how they were able to squeezed so much technology in such a small space.\n\nBy the way, this is a review of the iPad 2.  The first iPad, we skipped it completely.  There are many tablets in the market but it is really tough to compete with iPad. First, the interface.  This is what Apple is known for.  The simplicity, usability and ease of use of such a very compliated hardware is a miracle in itself.  I have tried other devices that are similar but the most of them seems to be  a  tad slower and  less smart.\n\nAnother big factor that is strongly going for the iPad is the number of apps availalble in the Apple store.  Android is starting to compete, specially now with big online stores like Amazon taking the challenge.  Still, it will take some time to really match the number and the quality of the apps in iTunes. Apple is also known for being strict in approving apps being sold in the App store.\n\nFunny thing is, what made me pull the trigger to finally buy an iPad despite the high tag price is the HP Touchpad fiasco.  I ordered one when it was advertised for $99.  I was ecstatic to have my order received and placed through Barnes & Noble,  only to be notified the next day that my order was cancelled.  Due to frustration, I walked in to the closest Apple store and got me one.\n\nWhat really amazed me is the usefullness of the tablet in education. I have heard so many times that it is good for kids who have autism and one of my kids was diagnosed with autism. He is so focused when playing with it.\nMy kids have DSs but most of the games are just for fun and entertainment. They get a little bit of learning at the beginning, but after that it is repetitive and just time waste.\n\nThere are amazing educational apps like the following:\n- Word Bingo\n- Math Bingo\n- Teach Me\n- Presidents vs Aliens\n- Stack the States.\n- Brainquests series\n- Write On (for learning cursive writing)\n\nNO FLASH:\n\niPad2 still does not support flash.  There are Aps that you can use to play flash on websites  like iShifter, etc.  It is not perfect but at least it works.\n\nSKYPE:\n\nOne of the advantages the iPad2 against iPad1 is that now you can do video calls with Skype or Yahoo Messenger."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I was apprehensive re: dropping a nice piece of change on a tablet and wasn't really sure if I really needed a tablet. I have a couple of laptops and have owned a netbook for a couple of years. I bought the netbook because of its portability, size, and relative light weight when I am on the road.\nThrowing caution to the wind, I bought this  Ipad2 and it was instant love. Installation was a snap and took a matter of minutes per the instruction card which comes with the device as well as accompanying online prompts. There are a huge number of applications available for the IPad and many of them are free; others are available at minimal cost. The learning curve for using this device is fast; if you own an IPhone it is even faster. The platform this is built on is similar in operation to the IPhone. As for installing new apps, I have yet to encounter any installation problems with my add ons, though some people have.\nIf you install the ereader app, it negates the need for a Kindle or Nook. While I'm not about to toss my Kindle, this is a nice alternative to carting around yet another device when I travel.\nThe battery's charge is supposed to last about 10 hours. That is a fairly accurate measure as I've been averaging about 9 to 10 hours before draining the charge.\nThe device's design is truly a work of art. While this is not a very constructive comment re: to buy or not to buy, I'm driven by aesthetics. I'm drawn to attractiveness and functionality. I own a lot of Apple products and their purchase has partially been driven on visual appeal and cleverness, though ultimately i have fallen in love with their ease of operation and their ability to go way beyond most folks'  imagination. What I am trying to say is that even if you buy this blindly assuming that it will do most of the things your laptop does you'll probably be surprised by its many added features. The  Ipad2 is very light and portable. It is easy to hold and with a smart cover or case that converts to a stand, it works great on a  flat surface or a lap. It can slip easily into a purse. I usually carry a small or medium Ameribag and have no problem getting it to fit. In order to keep this pad in pristine condition and safe, I installed a screen protector, a back cover, and a smart cover. For what it's worth, this pad is nifty but I wouldn't try to see if it will bounce if dropped. Additional accessories are readily available such as Bluetooth keyboards, headsets, and external speakers.\nThe 32 GB capacity is more than adequate for my needs. However, an application junkie may need 64GB. I mention this because my son is upgrading because he wants to add more apps and is running out of space. 16GB or 32GB is probably adequate for most users.\nResponse time is robust on this little sucker. While I didn't buy the 3G model, I haven't had a problem attaching to free WiFi and reception has always been good given that I'm usually in populous areas.\nThe pad's sound quality is good as well as the screen's image. The camera is o.k., but I prefer my IPhone's camera or better yet a high res dedicated camera.\nWhile I had no previous experience with IPad's first incarnation, IPad2 seems to be an improvement over the first release due to\nfaster processing speed and a lighter and more compact design. While there is no slot for an SD card, I suspect that subsequent IPads will feature better and/or more sophisticated cameras and video conferencing capabilities, and an SD card slot among other things.\nBottom line: the IPad2 is a fantastic device that is more versatile  than a netbook but lacks some of the functionality of a fully integrated laptop. It's compact size and light weight is a big draw as is its ease of operation and performance."}

Our experience has been different. It is difficult to operate.  First it is hard to get acquainted with.  Few instructions come with it.  One has to find the information on line.  It is a lengthy PDF file that is not user friendly.  One needs to read through it carefully.  It took a while to find the on switch.  When it opened there were no apps on the screen.  With no information it took several minutes to learn by trial and error how to slide the screen to find them.  Synchronizing with one's computer is not explained except in several different sections of the instructions.  Getting connected to a wifi router is another mystery to be solved.  There are thousands of \"free\" apps that turn out to be advertisements to buy what you really hoped for in the download.  Books are difficult to down load and don't appear on one's bookshelf but are in various locations.  Paper books are more appealing now.  I can share a paper book.  Though it costs more it gets more value out of it.  The \"10 hours\" of running time is really 10 hours unplugged.  Over all it is frustrating to use and not worth the price."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "After five months of using a 16GB iPad 2 WiFi (no 3G), I can honestly say that it is one of the most useful technology purchases I can think of. While its price may scare many people away, its usefulness can justify its price, especially when compared to other devices that perform similar tasks. Not a day has gone by in the last five months where the iPad 2 hasn't been used several times, usually by several family members.\n\nApple would like everyone to think that the iPad is revolutionary. Skeptics and critics scoff at the idea, but I would agree that it is a revolutionary product much in the same way that the Netbook (ASUS eeePC, et al) was a revolutionary product.\n\nBoth products created a new paradigm in how you look at accessing information, media, and other tasks, and once you use them, you find it difficult to go back to the traditional devices. Netbooks nearly killed laptops, but in turn are getting killed themselves by tablets. People loved the small size of netbooks, but the keyboards and displays were often too small. Compared to an iPad, a typical netbook is too clunky and too heavy. Those with the need for a keyboard need the larger keyboard that a laptop provides, and those that don't embraced tablets as quickly as they could.\n\nUsing the iPad for any length of time will make you not want to use your desktop PC for browsing the web or reading E-Mail. It's much more natural to hold a tablet in your lap or place it on the table next to you while having breakfast than it is to go into the other room and use a PC to do the same. Laptops are more portable than desktop PC's, but in comparison, they are much bulkier and many laptops have horrible battery life that don't come close to the 10 hours that one can get from the iPad 2.\n\nThat's not to say that desktop and laptop PC's don't have their place. They definitely do. If you're doing anything complex that requires a keyboard or a mouse, those other devices shine. However, if you're composing a normal E-Mail, browsing the web, reading news feeds, checking Facebook, or watching videos on Hulu or YouTube, the iPad does these things very well. Typing on the on-screen keyboard, especially in landscape mode, is very easy and I've gotten quite fast at doing so. The picture quality on the screen is very good; probably better than most laptop and desktop PC monitors are, and the touch interface is so natural that it doesn't require hardly any orientation to get comfortable using the interface.\n\nBrowsing the web is a joy on the 10\" screen. Sure, not having Flash compatibility is a pain sometimes, but Flash is one of those technologies of the past that is dwindling in popularity with the advent of HTML5, and it's in the site owner's best interests to develop versions of their sites that don't rely on Flash to do things that should have been done in other ways long before iOS devices came along. It's an occasional annoyance, but I don't consider the lack of Flash a dealbreaker in my mind. Web sites that don't work on the iPad are losing the business of the many that have iOS-based devices, and there are plenty of other sites that provide the same service that don't lean on the Flash crutch.\n\nReading E-Mail using the built-in E-Mail app is also very good. I prefer the sidebar list of E-Mails that appears in landscope mode over the popup menu listing in portrait mode, but that's a personal preference. GMail integration is smooth, and being able to access multiple accounts makes it easy to check several mailboxes, either in one megalist or as separate accounts. The calendar app integrates with Google Calendar and the contacts from GMail are available in the Contacts list on the iPad as well. The integration with Google's various apps is very good.\n\nOne of the best features of the iPad is the ecosystem that is built around the device. Apple has done a great job of supplying a major part of that by creating an AppStore with thousands of apps for just about every purpose one could think of. The iTunes store provides music, movies, and books for sale, but I prefer supplying my own music and movies, and Amazon's Kindle app / Kindle books is much more flexible and a better way to buy books in my opinion. On top of the software, the popularity of the iPad means that there are multitudes of accessories that cover the iPad, plug into the iPad, or otherwise complement the iPad in some way. No other portable device manufacturer has the 3rd party support that Apple has and that advantage shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nSpeaking of accessories, I did a lot of looking at cases, and I settled on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/AYL-100-Premium-Genuine-Slim-Leather-Case-Folio-with-Magnetic-Closure-and-3-in-1-built-in-Stand-for-Apple-Ipad-2nd-Generation-Tablet-Black/dp/B004WHI9L4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">AYL 100% Premium Genuine Slim Leather Case Folio with Magnetic Closure and 3-in-1 built-in Stand for Apple Ipad 2nd Generation Tablet (Black)</a>. It's a folio style cover that works very well in protecting the device while not adding too much bulk. I highly recommend getting some kind of case, and this one is nearly perfect.\n\nThe iPad 2 costs a lot of money. That makes it out of reach of some people, so it's not a slam-dunk. However, if you compare it to the cost of a new laptop or desktop PC, it's not out of line. If you're reading E-Mail, looking at videos, and browsing the web, the iPad does these things very well. You'll still need another device that will store your digital camera photos, keep track of your finances, and do the complex tasks that a desktop/laptop can do, but you'll need that device much less once you've discovered the ease of using something like this for those everyday tasks that don't require a full-sized keyboard and full-blown Windows programs to accomplish.\n\nNo other tablet device currently available on the market has come close to the capabilities and the ecosystem that the iPad enjoys. I had hopes that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ASUS-Eee-Pad-Transformer-TF101-A1-10-1-Inch-Tablet-Computer-Tablet-Only/dp/B004U78J1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ASUS Eee Pad Transformer TF101-A1 10.1-Inch Tablet Computer (Tablet Only)</a>&nbsp;would take it on, but it seems hampered by software issues (trying to do too much and be too flexible can be troublesome), the Androad app market still trails the iOS app market considerably, and the number of accessories available pales in comparison.\n\nThe best non-iOS device that I think has a chance of being a contender is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kindle-Fire-Full-Color-7-Multi-touch-Display-Wi-Fi/dp/B0051VVOB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi</a>. It has a great price point, it has Amazon standing behind it with an ecosystem that includes an AppStore, music store, video store for TV and movies, and the excellent Kindle books system, which is almost an ecosystem all by itself. I'm very interested to see how the Kindle Fire accomplishes the tasks of a tablet device and I hope that it can be a contender in the marketplace.\n\nAnyone interested in a tablet device should be looking at the major products that are available and see how those products serve their needs. While the iPad 2 is a major investment, I don't regret making the purchase. I think the iPad 2 is hard to beat!"}

My husband had just purchased a computer for me as a birthday gift coincidentally, and it had a hard drive failure the 3rd time it booted up.  So we returned it and bought a second iPad 2 for me.  We are completely addicted.  They are so user friendly, work well, and are instant on and off (instead of waiting forever to boot up and shut down like a computer).  We both absolutely love them.\n\nYou iPad may not have the latest operating system on it since many have been sitting in stores waiting to be sold.  If it has 4.3.5 or older, then you simply can take it to a Verizon store and have them activate it at no charge.  They are an official Apple Store.\n\nIf you need to update your iPad 2 to the new IOS 5 that is to be released in October 2011, then I have some tips, to possibly prevent a lot of grief. HOWEVER, you can just skip all the rest of the technical part of my review if you pay a small fee to have operating system IOS 5 downloaded onto your new iPad 2 so that it is completely independent of a regular computer and iTunes. This is a huge step that Apple has been developing for awhile now.  I don't know if Verizon will do it for free, but Best Buy will do it for $29.95.  If you go to Verizon, make sure the employee is quite familiar with activating the iPad, etc.  Our local Verizon person acted like she knew, but when I brought it home, it wasn't activated.  That's why I had to go through all this stuff so I could do it on my own computer.\n\nThe current operating system as of today requires hook up to a computer that has iTunes on it.  The new \"IOS 5\" is due to come out in the next 10-15 days, between October 10-15, 2011.  Anyone who buys an iPad 2 that already has IOS 5 loaded and, also, anyone who already owns an ipad 2 who updates to this version; will be able to do everything without being dependent upon a computer and iTunes.  Right now, you upload photos, your own music, and download and install updates via your computer using iTunes on a regular computer. You can load these things by emailing to your iPad from your computer where they are stored, but if you have a lot, it is easier to transfer via iTunes on your computer.\n\nMy review is long and some is very technical.  You can stop here if I've already given you helpful info you wanted to know.  The very next section is about some apps I recommend and then after that is the very technical part that isn't necessary if you don't have a computer or want to take my suggestion and pay to have IOS 5 installed on your iPad.\n\n------\n\nBefore I get on with the heavy-duty technical part that you may or may not want read, let me recommend a few apps that you can purchased inexpensively.  Part of the fun is customizing your iPad with apps that you enjoy or help you with your tasks:\n\n1. A free app for the iPad is \"Goodreader.\"  This is a great app.  You can view about any format of a file in this app, even Excel files.  You can also make annotations with various symbols and highlighting that the program offers.  You can also unzip a zip file in Goodreader.  I've never done it, but you can watch a video in that app as well.  It has a great folder and file management system that is easy.  I believe you can even bring in files to your iPad from your computer via wi-fi or ftp.  You can also save a web page for reading off line when you are not near wi-fi, such as on an airplane.  I really like this program.\n\n2.  If you like to use Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, you can get these apps, but they are $20 each.  I have two excel spreadsheets that I like to keep up on a daily or weekly basis.  One, for example, are our household expenditures and deposits.  Since Goodreader doesn't let you actually add to a Word document or Excel file, I found a program called \"Office 2 HD.\"  This one is not free.  It is a $6.99 program plus fee and tax, but that is less than you pay for either Word or Excel.  It's pretty easy.  What I did was email to myself my Excel file from my computer.  I opened the email in iPad 2 and clicked on the attached file.  Then I tapped on the little curved arrow that you would tap if you want to reply to or forward an email and it gave me the option of opening the file in either Goodreader or Office 2 HD.  I selected Office 2 HD.  Then I opened that app, opened that file, and tapped the Save button.  The Save button gives you a choice of Save or Save As.  When you want to be able to type in the file, you choose Save As and rename it.  If you don't want to rename the file, than add a \"1\" to the file name on your computer before you email it to yourself on iPad; and then when you Save As, just delete the 1.  Easy.  Of course, it works differently inserting rows, etc., than a regular spreadsheet of Excel program, so you really do need to refer to their help menu.  I like the program though, because it is inexpensive and lets me keep up edit my favorite already existing spreadsheets.  You can create new ones also, of course.  I haven't used the word processor yet, but it is probably even easier than a spreadsheet.  Oh, it has a Power Point type program in it also.\n\n3.  Right now the default Safari brower on the iPad isn't very good.  I'm very spoiled to using tabs so I can open search listings in a new tab without losing my search page or use the tabs to go back and forth comparing info on two or three different web pages.  The new IOS 5 is giving Safari tabs.  However, I really like \"Web Perfect Browser\" which is only $3.99 plus fee and tax.  Not only does it provide a tab system for browsing, but will also save web pages for offline reading.  I save a web page in the Browser if it is something I want to read later, but not necessarily save.  I save a web page in Goodreader, if I want to keep it for reference.  I don't know all the changes they are going to make in Safari.  You might go ahead and check it all out before buying Web Perfect Browser in case it is good enough for your purposes.\n\n4.  A great picture organizer program is \"Photo Mgr Pro.\"  Once again, the new IOS 5 is making big improvements on the default photo.  Perhaps you won't even need this app.  The current default Photo app is terrible.  You cannot put them in the order you want.  As far as I know, the only way to create Albums (folders) is to arrange the folders you want in a special iPad folder on your computer first and then upload the special folder and its contents to the iPad through iTunes.  You still can't arrange the order, however.  I know they have made improvements in the new operating system; but if you don't like it, try the Photo Mgr Pro.  It's good.\n\nBy the way, the final price of an app varies because some are Apple apps and some are 3rd-Party developers.  The developers do get a fee from each purchase.  All apps have tax added.  I'm not sure how this works, but I do notice that the difference between the app purchase price and the final price is not always the same percentage.  However, apps are so reasonably priced, it just isn't that important.  Just know that when it says $3.99, it actually will be a little more.\n\n---------\n\nTHE TECHNICAL PART OF MY REVIEW REGARDING PROBLEMS UPDATING OR INSTALLING ITUNES:\n\nIt isn't a big deal using your computer and iTunes (if you have a computer) unless you have the following problems that I ran into.  Here are a couple of solutions below.\n\nDON'T LET MY INSTRUCTIONS SCARE YOU.  REMEMBER, you can just have IOS 5 put on it after its released, and you don't have to deal with any of this. By the way, if you don't have a computer, you can take the iPad to a Verizon store to activate it. They don't charge for it since they are contracted by Apple. Best Buy may also do it for a small fee when you don't buy it there.  Best Buy will also download and install updates for you for $29.95, so wait until the new IOS 5.0 is released and have them put that one on it.  That eliminates the computer and iTunes problem since you will be able update and download from the iPad. (I'm repeating, but knowing how to do this with ease and avoiding the problems is valuable to know.)\n\nNow back to the iTunes problem.  NOTE:  My instructions are for a PC with XP. It is possible you won't be able to install the latest version of iTunes.  You need a version later than the 9.0 and above series.  It must start with a 10.0 or later for it to be connected to your ipad.  I use version 10.4.1.  I discovered that since I apparently had some previous version of iTunes and/or Quick Time on my computer, it left behind some kind of language.  Therefore, after I downloaded itunes version 10.4.1 and attempted to install it; it appeared to install, but wouldn't open.  An error message appeared saying there were missing files.  After spending 3 days researching off and on for the solution and trying to reinstall etc., I finally found a document on the Internet stating exactly what to remove and how to do it. INSTRUCTIONS: From the PC via Add and Remove Programs in the Control Panel remove iTunes.  Then you remove Apple Application Support.  You don't have to uninstall Quick Time.  Then you close and reboot.  Don't open any programs, but do shutdown firewall and anti-virus programs and turn off your DSL/broadband.  Now you can go to your iTunes install file you saved and install it. Now it will work, or it may say something about Mobile Device Service not started. If so, open Control Panel again and open Administrative Tools.  Open the \"Services\" folder. Click ONCE on Apple Mobile Device folder.  To the left of the file, it says \"Stop the Service\" and \"Start the Service.\"  Click on \"Stop the Service\" and then click on \"Start the Service.\"  I can't remember if you reboot again, but it will tell you. After this, iTunes, should work just fine unless some other cause is creating your problem.\n\nNEXT PROBLEM that many people are having is that iTunes will perform all the functions for your iPad except it won't download an OS (Operating System) Update.  It will act like it's downloading, but eventually times out.  I have a solution, but you can confirm that your problem is the same as mine by doing the following:  Open iTunes and click on Help on the menu.  Select \"Run Diagnostics\".  Uncheck everything except the first line to do a Connectivity Test. Make sure your DSL or wi-fi is connected. Click Next. Click Next again and it will list test results.  The first two lines will have green dots, meaning ok.  The third line will be red, \"Secure Link to iTunes Store Failed.\"  What is peculiar about this is that I can purchase an app through the store, but can't download an update.  The problem is somewhere in conflicting language or programs.  After 3 more days of trying to fix, it I finally found a webpage that lists direct links to Apple and instructions.  You choose your particular kind of iPad; for example, iPad 2 wi-fi only.  Then you download the file and save it to a folder where you won't forget where it is.  Be aware that is is a 690 MG file!  It takes hours to download.  I have DSL \"light\" which means it is slower than regular hi-speed, so it took my file 8 hours to download. Make sure your Power settings say never so the computer won't sleep during the download.  It's ok if your monitor sleeps or the desk top activates a screen saver. By the way, I also was not able to download it on my computer than has iTunes.  I had to use my very old computer that has never had iTunes on it.  My itunes computer blocked downloads even directly from Apple!  If you don't have another computer, use someone else's computer that doesn't have iTunes. OR just wait for IOS 5 (release in Oct. 2011) and pay Best Buy $29.95 to download it and install! After downloading it, I put it on a flash drive and transferred it to my other computer that has iTunes.  Next, plug in iPad to your computer via the cable included; do this BEFORE opening iTunes.  If you haven't already activated your new iPad 2, then you will be activating it now through iTunes.  Once it is activated, you are ready to install the update you downloaded, which will IOS 5 after it released. iTunes may pop up a window that asks if you want to download the update.  Press Cancel.  If it is set up to automatically download it, press the X next to the field at the top where it is showing that is is downloading.  That will stop it.  NOW, since your iTunes will not work for downloading if you have the same connectivity issue that I do, you will HOLD DOWN your shift key WHILE you press the UPDATE button.  You will only see the UPDATE button if you plugged in your ipad first to your computer and then open iTunes.  A menu just for your iPad will appear across the middle of the screen and the Update button is on the Summary tab.  After you hold down the shift key while clicking on Update, it will pop up a screen allowing you to find your downloaded file.  If you computer downloaded it as a ZIP file, you'll have to unzip it first and then choose the file.  iTunes will now update your iPad with the new update.  It takes about 10 min or less.  By the way, I have Opera browser on my old computer and discovered that it doesn't force a zip file as some browsers do.  It will download the file as it actually comes with the correct file extension.\n\nHope this review doesn't scare you off.  Remember!  You don't have to deal with any of these problems if you pay a store that is set up for iPads to download the new IOS 5 operating system which makes iPad completely independent of a separate computer and iTunes.  Again, I don't know what Verizon would charge, but $29.95 is pretty good at Best Buy.  Call first to make sure the stores near you will do it.\n\nHave fun with Ipad 2.  It's great!  I'm quite advanced on PC's as I used them for the last 15 years for my jobs.  Now I'm retired, and the Ipad 2 is just great fun and new Apps to let you customize it for your own interests are very reasonable."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "My IPad2 probably has the worst operating system I have ever seen. I wonder at how something so weak could be so popular. I now see why there are so many Apps available that use work-around methods to try to make up for the lack of a more complete system.\n\nI bought an Apple II in the early `80s and soon had to learn to use workaround routines to produce acceptable results. When the IBM PC became available I bought one and discovered what a well-executed operating system was like. I used Microsoft DOS for 8 years before changing to Windows 3.1 which was slowly developed into the present Windows 7 version.\n\nIt looks like Apple is repeating the same cycle with the IPAD2. The system is so restrictive it limits any chance of even limited productivity. If you're only interested in playing games, email or rather poor quality photo images and video then you'll probably like the Ipad2. I will admit it's very stylish which is probably a big help with sales but you can't tell a book by its cover. I might suggest talking to someone who has one to see how satisfied they are with the product and how they actually use it. It's a more of a toy of very limited use than something really practical."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I'm not a tech guy. In fact, I generally loathe having to deal with computers and technology. Unfortunatly, since I own my own business I spend a large part of my day sending e-mails, processing orders, and doing book keeping, so much of my day is spent interacting with technology. I also spend a good portion of my day on the road, and until recently I had to lug my laptop around. Whenever I found down time, wherever I was, I'd have to bring it out, wait for it to boot up, log on to the internet, get my work done, then wait for it to shut down. It got the job done, but it was heavy and awkward to carry around, and uncomfortable to use in the car.\n\nI'd been considering switching to a tablet for a long time, and when I finally decided to go ahead and make the switch I researched every tab on the market. I spent a lot of time testing tabs at the electronics stores. Some just weren't very intuitive, and getting them to perform required more effort than I was willing to invest. Some were choppy. Some seemed to crash every 5 minutes.\n\nThe one that always operated beautifully was the Ipad 2. Unfortunately, my business requires that I watch videos my clients send me, and the lack of flash support worried me. Ultimately I decided I could use the Ipad on the road and watch whatever videos I couldn't get to play when I got home to my computer.\n\nSet up was very easy - and I'm not the most computer literate guy. Downloaded Itunes, plugged the Ipad in, and it was up and running. Within an hour the lack of flash support became annoying... Then I did a bit of research and found an App for $4.99 that allowed me to view flash on my Ipad flawlessly! The Ipads one limitation was solved for less than $5.00! Now I have Apps that simplify every element of my business. Maps, record keeping, creating documents...\n\nThe Ipad is wonderful to travel with. Day to day, on the road locally, it is light and slim, easy to take with my wherever I go. When I need to access records or check my e-mail I no longer have to wait for my laptop to boot up, with the touch of a button my Ipad is up and running, and on the internet moments later.\n\nThe battery life is stunning... It keeps me entertained and/or productive on long flights, and in hotel rooms in unfamiliar cities.\n\nI very rarely use my laptop since I got my Ipad. My Ipad does everything my laptop did for me, only it usually does it faster and easier. In fact, the main thing I wish I could change about the Ipad is the fact that it needs a computer to sync with (though it only needs to do this very rarely)... I wish it were a completely independant device so I could just set my laptop aside completely and let it gather dust.\n\nThe Ipad isn't 100% perfect. The camera isn't impressive at all. Watching flash requires downloading and using a seperate web browser app (I generally use Safari, overall its a better browser than the flash enabled one. When I run into a flash issue, I copy the address, open the Photon app and paste the address there) It's slightly annoying to have to take the extra steps, but it's not a huge issue.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with it!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I was given an iPad 2 for Mother's Day this year and it is truly one of the best gifts I've ever received! I have a large family, and every person here uses the iPad on a regular basis. It's been in use for the last 5+ months from morning until night and I am still delighted and amazed with it.\n\nI'd never personally owned a tablet before, or an Apple product, but we have multiple computers and all manner of electronic devices in our home and most people would consider me and my family to be techies. Because we have laptops and desktops and netbooks and smart phones, I didn't think that a tablet would particularly add to our level of connectivity or productivity. I was so wrong.\n\nUpon opening my iPad2, I was instantly struck by its thinness and its simplicity. There was just the tablet and a charger and a small, welcome pamphlet. I turned it on and it gracefully guided me through setting up my wireless connection. It offered me a tutorial, but I was too excited to bother with that. I was surfing the net within seconds because the interface is so intuitive.\n\nBy now, there are loads of reviews that go into detail about the cameras and other hardware featured on the iPad2 so rather than bore you, I will focus on some of the real world ways this tablet has changed the way we do things in my home.\n\nAs a homeschooling mother of a 9 year old, this tablet has made the best things about learning at home even better! The battery life is so good that we keep it with us all over the house. No need to worry about being near a power supply or booting up time or any of that. The iPad 2 is always connected, always ready. There are literally thousands of amazing apps, many of them free, that enrich my child's learning day. He is working on improving his handwriting and using an app that lets him write right on the screen! If he makes a mistake, it prompts him to try again until he gets the hang of it. Math, reading, journaling, science, anatomy, astronomy, geography, music - there's an app for that!\n\nHaving the iPad2 has meant that whenever my son wonders about something or asks a question about something, we have the answers right in our hands. Remember when you didn't know how to spell a word or a definition in school? Remember how the teacher told you to go look it up? This is like that, only a thousand times better because there is no walk of shame past the whole class to the big dictionary. My son looks up things all day long just because he WANTS to!\n\nThere are several exceptional music programs that feature an electronic keyboard. My favorite cost a couple of dollars and my boy is now playing music. It translates well, too, because I have a piano and he is able to play tunes he learned on the iPad on our full size piano.\n\nOf course, there are games, too. Lots of them. This has been a real boon when we go on road trips. Even though there is no wi-fi in the car, my son has loads of apps to keep him entertained until we reach our destination. No more asking \"are we there yet\"?\n\nI have a 15 month old granddaughter who is becoming very iPad saavy, too. It amazed me that even a young toddler quickly grasps the concept of icons and different apps doing different things. She actually knows how to turn it on and choose the correct folder to find the Fruit Ninja app and successfully launch it and play! There are several other games she enjoys, as well as some delightful alphabet games and story book apps. She also enjoys having us take video of her with the iPad and then play it back for her.\n\nI generally have it with me in the kitchen at meal times because I can look up a recipe and have it in front of me while cooking. Or I can watch a movie with the Netflix app while baking or preparing more complicated meals. If I didn't have a Kindle already, I would be using the Kindle app to read ebooks, too. Thanksgiving won't be nearly as tedious for me this year because of my iPad.\n\nI now take it with me when I travel instead of my laptop because it fits in my purse! I got a bluetooth keyboard to go with it so even when I need to type a lot, it's no problem (although the virtual keyboard is responsive and quicker to type on than you might think). I spent several days at a hospital with a friend and the iPad allowed us both to keep up with email, google for further medical info, and even watch a movie. I've discovered that there is wi-fi almost everywhere! (That's good because I didn't choose the 3G version.) My friend was so impressed that she bought an iPad as soon as she got home!\n\nEven though the device is almost fantastically thin and elegant, I would caution you to purchase and use a case all the time with your iPad. The screen is plenty tough but I have read many, many warnings about dropping it on one of it's corners, which results in the screen shattering. A case is good insurance and many of them feature the magnetic on/off, which conserves battery charge while protecting your iPad when you aren't using it.\n\nOther nice, but not essential, accessories are a protective screen film, a capacitive-style stylus, and an extra charger/car adapter. If you will be using your iPad as a replacement for a notebook on a regular basis, a wireless, bluetooth keyboard is nice, too. But other than a good case, the iPad2 needs nothing else to be up and running straight out of the box.\n\nHighly, highly recommended."}

As a college student and future programmer I love having the iPad as a second screen. I can have my Kindle and PDF textbooks, web tutorials or HTML help apps open on the iPad as I type notes and program on my laptop. I am not constantly having to minimize or switch between windows on my laptop screen, which is pretty nice. I can also have Netflix, the ABC app or Hulu playing as I do homework. The small size of the iPad allows for me to slip it right into the same case as my laptop, awesome! They have some laptops now that have a pull out second screen but it seems to be an expensive option that leaves no other features like the iPad (or another tablet) does.\n\niPads also have a lot of other fun features besides providing you with more screen real-estate when you aren't doing homework or programming!\n\nThe End\n\n*I am a fan of Apple, have been since the early 90's when in 1st grade I was blown away by the amazing Oregon Trail (yes I know it was MECC software) on the IIGS in all it's green glory.

Points to consider:\n- I thought I'd put my digital pics on the Ipad, but there is no port, so I can't hook my camera up to it.\n- The picture quality of pictures taken with the Ipad was TERRIBLE.\n-I would love to have internet access anywhere but the Ipad is too bulky to carry around (and do I really want 24/7 access to email and internet anyway?).\n-Watching a movie is uncomfortable, as I'd have to hold the Ipod in my hand in order to see the screen well enough.  -No need to have Itunes on the Ipad as I can't exactly jog with it and the speakers are WEAK.\n-The keyboard was surprisingly easy to use, but not as fast a a regular.\n- I'd have to buy a case, a stand, and a screen protector if I wanted to carry it around regularly.\n-I realize a lot of these issues could be solved in one way or another, but I just don't have the time to figure it all out.  I am quite happy sitting with my Macbook, with a keyboard, a cd/dvd disk drive, a an firewire and usb port!\n\n I would not suggest the Ipad, especially if you already own other Mac products."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I recently received the Apple iPod 2 as a birthday gift. Since I never had the iPad 1 I'm still learning how to use it, although it is somewhat similar to my 3rd generation iPod touch. The iPad 2 has a lot of nice features built in such as a video/picture camera and FaceTime. What I really don't like about my iPad is that I can't download Adobe or watch shows on Hulu or any other website without paying fees. These are things that I can do on my regular laptop at no extra cost. Apple is forcing the iPad purchasers to use iTunes or to pay extra fees elsewhere. If I had known this from the start I would have returned the iPad and bought a tablet. If you don't like watching videos online or you don't mind paying extra fees then the iPad is great. As for me I am not happy with it.\n\nUpdate 12/28/11: iPad now offers Apps for ABC and TV.com for CBS so I can watch shows from these networks for free and I don't have to purchase them from iTunes. The iPad is still restrictive compared to some tablets, but I'm going to change my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars. iPad is equal or superior to most tablets currently on the market, but I just wish that it wasn't so restrictive in some cases."}

Who needs an iPad when you have a desktop, an iPhone, and a laptop? An iPad would be a total waste of money, right? Well, now I finally have an iPad 2, and OH MY GOODNESS, HOW DID I LIVE WITHOUT IT ALL THIS TIME?!?!?\n\nThe iPad is amazing. You are all familiar with the impressive  technical details, I'm sure. Incredibly thin. Unbelievably lightweight. Spectacularly clear screen. Amazing battery life. The list goes on and on. However, the product description doesn't tell you how the iPad will change your life. Seriously, it has changed mine. I have no need to drag a heavy laptop around now that I have my iPad. As someone who rarely uses word processing programs anymore, the iPad has rendered my laptop practically useless. It also has some awesome word processing apps, so if I do need to type something, I can do so with ease, even using a touch screen. It's so nice to be able to pull this out of my bag and have instant Internet access with an amazing screen wherever I am. I have the 32GB version with wi-fi, and have plenty of space to store movies, music, apps, whatever. My iPad is with me wherever I go.

But really, it isn't the quick loading time, ease of multi-tasking, handsome hardware, beautiful resolution, or even cost that made us get this over other tablets.  It's the ability to have so many tens of thousands of applications.\n\nI use Kindle app, Moviefone, Scrabble, Netflix, and Groupon all the time.\n\nMy 3 year old uses Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, and wide variety of educational apps and games.\n\nMy 6 month old loves Itsy Bitsy Spider and other children's apps with music and interactivity. She loves to send the spider climbing.\n\nMy husband loves playing with the newest apps like Vid Rhythm (from the company that makes Rock Band).\n\nWhen my husband's parents visited from England, they loved it that the daily crossword puzzle on The Guardian's website was FREE and interactive.\n\nWe all love getting on Skype to speak to family in other countries.  The camera is great and I even took it outside last weekend to show my sister how well my tomatoes are doing.\n\nOn early weekend mornings, we usually put educational DVDs for my son. However, my husband likes to watch England Premier League football. So what he does is watch it on the iPad while my son gets to watch his DVDs...everyone is happy!\n\nIt's been stepped on, dropped, taken to the beach, on picnics, and has endured a lot of use with no problems.  And through all of that it has given us so much entertainment, access to information, connection with friends and family (Facebook, Skype, email, you name it), peace at the restaurant (\"here, why don't you play with Thomas the Tank Engine?\"), and something to do while sitting in a hospital (streaming Netflix instead of the $12 daily charge at the hospital).\n\nIt's absolutely wonderful."}

I recommend, however, if you've never used an iPad, or for that matter, any Apple hardware device, you go to Apple.com and download the user manual. Apple's intellectual property security fetish is problematic if you have info on more than one laptop(s) or desktop(s) that you'd like to load on the iPad (music libraries especially). If you're a PC user, then the upload process for images is absolutely not straight forward. Copying photos takes some trial and a lot of error going from PC to iPad. Also, the version of Safari on the iPad isn't similar to the laptop/desktop screen. There's no tools header. Over all, if you want a book reader or an expensive PDA, this is the device for you."}

If what you do is surf the web and use Itunes then the Ipad will be what you need and its so much more convienent than having to go to my computer everytime I want to look up a score of a game or see a movie review.  I would recommend the Ipad2 to anyone.\n\nI also read lots of books and I must say reading books on the Ipad vs. The Kindle is no comparison either.  The Ipad's ibooks look so much better and I like the feel a lot better than the Kindle.  Kindle also makes a big deal about being able to locate a book and be reading it within 60 seconds.....so can I on the Ipad.  So I don't know why they are trying to use that as a great feature."}

Also, it looks very sleek and modern.\n- The battery life is wonderful. I use my iPad 2 for hours on end and by the end of the day, there is still more than 50% battery.\n- Facetime is a great feature. My boyfriend and I Facetime daily and it's just like being there with him. Really cool and great for people who want to video chat with their family or friends.\n- Great resolution. Nearly every app and feature of this device is crystal clear. Better than an HDTV.\n- There are literally thousands of apps that one could download & lot of great free ones.\n- Very fast internet that NEVER freezes or force closes. Even the most detailed, memory eating web pages will load in a couple of seconds.\n- You could view many websites at once. With the iPad 2, you don't have to close your Yahoo! e-mail to access your Facebook. With this, you could open up several tabs to multitask.\n- Fast touch keyboard that is large enough to not make mistakes. I take my college notes on this daily and it's fast enough and easy enough to keep up with even the fastest-speaking prof.\n- Good memory space. I only got the 16GB and I'm very surprised at how much data it holds.\n\nCons\n- The camera is ABSOLUTELY horrible. When I went to take my first picture, I couldn't help but notice the graininess of the camera. So, if you're looking to purchase this & do a TON of photography, I wouldn't recommend it. It's worse than a 1990s digital camera. Less than one megapixel.\n- Sometimes the screen rotates without me flipping it. Not a huge deal but it could get annoying.\n\nAs you can see, the pros definitely outweigh the cons. Overall, it's a good device and a smart buy. You could practically use it anywhere and for nearly everything. Very glad that I purchased this."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "How much do I love my iPad2?  Well, as I joke I tell to friends, my husband is threatening to name it the corespondent in our divorce suit. That's only a half joke.  I've had this wonderful piece of personal technology since shortly after it was released in April.  It goes absolutely everywhere with me.  I commute on the train to work, so I got the 3G version for connectivity when I am out of wifi range.  With AT&T, it is a reasonable $25 a month for 2 gigs of data transfer, and that is more than enough.  And I can turn the 3G plan on and off on a month-by-moth basis if I don't think I'll need it.\n\nThis thing is so much more than its specs.  Here's what I use it for:  My email, both personal and work; reading Kindle and iBooks; reading the NY Times in the train, as well as checking about half a dozen other news sites for the latest information; reading magazines in their full-color glory (I recommend Zinio); watching movies and TV (Netflix streaming, Hulu Plus, ABC, You Tube and more -  it's been a godsend since last week's hurricane, which lunched my living room TV); participating in discussion forums and blogs; checking Facebook; shopping, shopping, shopping; checking weather; getting maps and navigation; having video chats with friends; using Skype for landline calls when I was in Spain and couldn't use my iPhone; playing with jigsaw puzzles, my favorite time suck.  There's much, more more, but I'd be here all night.\n\nI know that other Android-based tablets can do most of these things and can even do something's that iPad cannot.  But I love the look and feel of the iPad -  it feels very light in my hands, even with a leather cover.  And I love the incredible range of apps available from Apple.  Some Apple-haters would accuse me of \"drinking the Apple KoolAid\" and let them.  All I know is that this is the best piece of personal technology that has yet been invented."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "So, you're thinking of buying an iPad however, you're not so sure of what it can do and how it works. So, here is the \"Dummies Guide to the iPad\" to help you make that decision.\n\n\"I promise to keep the jargon down to a bare minimum\" :\n\nTo begin with the iPad must be paired to an existing Laptop or Desktop PC. These can be normal Microsoft Windows or Mac PC's. Once paired you can use the iPad by itself. It only has to be paired once. Although, there is a rumour that the next generation will work straight out of the box.\n\nYou will be able to:\n\n-Touch and pinch the screen to type words and move things around\n-Send and Receive Emails\n-Browse the Internet including Online Banking, Internet Shopping and more...\n-Listen to Music, including the Radio when there is a Wireless (Wi-Fi) connection\n-Watch Videos and Movies\n-Write and Print Letters (see the section on 'Printing' further down)\n-Download and Play Games\n-Become a Smarter Person (more on this later)\n-Display Pictures - it is an electronic Picture Frame too!\n-Take Pictures and Movies, if it has the onboard camera (iPad2 and newer)\n-Have a chat with the relatives abroad using Video Conferencing technology\n-Download THOUSANDS of books into a snazzy Book Reader that you can actually turn pages on the screen with\n-There are loads more - I'll leave them as a surprise if you decide to buy one :)\n\nYou will NOT be able to:\n\n-Watch a special type of animation or movie using a technology known as 'Flash' - don't worry about this though, you'll hear lots of people complaining about it. It really is no big deal and you'll learn to live without it. Over time, many of the popular web sites will move away from using Flash and use a newer technology that DOES work on iPads.\n-Insert a CD (there is no slot and you don't actually need one)\n-In fact, there is not much else you can't do with an iPad :\n\nTHE WIZARDS\n\nNo, not the ones' from Oz! Wizards are helpful programs that magically pop up and automatically configure things like the Internet and Email connections for you. The iPad has more Wizards than you can wave a wand at! When you first switch it on and whenever you need to set something up it will automatically present you with a Wizard. Therefore setting things up is as easy as 1-2-3.\n\nThe iPad is also an iPod!! - Loading music is done in one of two ways.\n\n1 - install the free version of iTunes onto your normal PC and follow the Wizards instructions to download your music from the 'iTunes Store' or transfer your music from your favourite CD collection. Then, connect the iPad to your computer using the supplied cable and it will automatically 'Synchronise' your music to the iPad. Yup, you guessed it - using yet another Wizard!\n\n2 - iTunes is a built in application (or App) on the iPad itself. Tap this App to search for and download your music directly to the iPad. You could even download a movie or your favourite episode of 24 too!\n\nOnce the music is on there just tap the iPod App to listen to it. Easy-Peasy!\n\nAPPS\n\nThe iPad extensively uses Apps. Apps are downloaded, using Wi-Fi. This is why you don't need a CD drive. These are the icons that are displayed on the screen.\n\nApps are downloaded from the Internet using yet another App called: \"The App Store\". Tap this icon to search for or see a list of the most popular Apps available, some are paid for and some are free! Tap the 'Install' button next to the one you'd like, follow the Wizards instructions and the App will automatically download and appear as a new icon on the screen.\n\nLOADING PICTURES\n\nThese can be loaded onto the iPad using iTunes, Email or the 'Camera Connection Kit' - this is a separate adaptor ($30) that plugs into the bottom of the iPad. Just insert the memory card from your camera into the adaptor and it will automatically load the pictures into the built in Photo App.\n\nTHE PICTURE FRAME\n\nWhen the iPad is locked (by pressing the button on the top-right side) and then back on again, you'll see a little icon in the lower right side corner of the display. Tap this and the Photo App will automatically display your pictures in full screen mode, converting the iPad into a digital Photo frame! It is a great feature. This means that you can leave the ipad on the shelf, literally as part of your rooms decor! You may want to purchase a 'Dock ($30)' to have the iPad tilted and supported at just the right angle.\n\nTip: if you need a reason to justify buying an iPad to your wife - use the Picture Frame one!!\n\nPRINTING\n\nPrinting is done wirelessly, however you MUST use one of the wireless printers detailed on the apple.com website. Typically, it will not print to anything other than one of those printers. There is one caveat to this statement, it is possible to print to any wireless printer if you pay for and download a third party App that is available via the App Store - use the search keywords 'wireless printing' to find it.\n\nIt is also possible to email whatever you'd like to print and pick it up on your normal PC for printing.\n\nFinally, I mentioned that you could become a Smarter Person by using an iPad - in fact this is not a joke. There are thousands of educational Apps including ones' for learning Astronomy through to learning how to read and play music and even Apps that will help you learn a new language. The possibilities are literally right at your finger tips!!\n\nIf you're unsure of which size to buy just buy the largest one you can afford. I have a 32GB version and have only used half of its capacity even with some very large Apps installed.\n\nThe iPad is many things to many people and the information above is just scratching the surface.\n\n\"I hope this review helps you make the right decision and I also hope that I did not use too much confusing jargon.\"\n\nGood luck!\n\n*** update 12th October 2011 ***\n\nApple have released their new Operating System (iOS 5)\n\nAmongst many new and enhanced features there is now the ability to synchronise data across multiple Devices. They call it 'iCloud' - think of iCloud as 'Virtual Filing Cabinet' to store your Documents, Diary and a record of your downloaded media from iTunes. Always accessible as long as there is an internet connection.\n\niCloud also allows the iPad to be used without having to 'Pair' it with a computer. It will now work straight out of the box!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I'm a developer and Android fan who also happens to have and Android phone which I love. So I was looking for the same experience in a tablet, and mostly because of Android being open and the fact that I may be able to apply custom roms, etc. After researching a lot, months ago I found the Androids tablet to be superior, or so I thought, to the iPad. Thats because I compared the hardware specs, usb support, etc. So I bought an Archos tablet first and then a GTab. But to be honest, the experience was never fluid or at least not near to what I was used in my phone. The UI is very laggy and there are too many bugs still. After a while I couldn't stand it anymore and I sold them. I think the problem is the software, Android, which is evolving and is still not ready for primetime, though I do think it will be sometime given the currnt trend.\n\nSo I decided to give the iPad a try. And it was worth it. The experience of this product is amazing, everything is crisp and fluid, even with less hardware than the Android ones. There's just no way to compare the OS in this regard. The iPad offers the best experience for a tablet today. If you don't believe me go and try one for at least 30 mins. I know that Apple is closed and all of those things I also hate, but still, the experience of using this device is so amazing it outweights other purely inellectual aspects, at least for me it does.\n\nIf you want a tablet that is fluid, reliable and just works, buy the iPad. Even the iPad 1 will do. If you want to play with roms and don't mind the bugs and UI freezes and basically don't mind spending time debugging usability issues, buy and Android tablet for the nice things like USB integration and openess.\n\nFor now I'll stick to Android for phones and to Apple for tablets. Let's see what happens a year from now.\n\nHope this review helps."}

Instead Apple will give you a refurbished Ipad if your warranty is still in effect. If your warranty has expired then your only option may be to throw your Ipad away. This means that after 13 months (unless you pay for an extra year of warranty then it will be 25 months) you could be flushing $500-$800 down the toilette. Even worse, if you are still under a warranty then Apple will give you a refurbished Ipad which could have 2-3 year old parts in it. An Applette at an Apple store told me that any broken Ipads are sent back to the factory where the unbroken parts are recycled into other Ipads. In other words, if you have a 6 month old Ipad that breaks, you could get a replacement that is already 2 years old. These disposal electronics only have a 3-5 year lifespan and `refurbished' has a reputation of lasting 1 month past the end of the warranty period or 6 months, whichever is a shorter period. If you are one of those that just has to have an Ipad then buy the cheapest one, otherwise buy the competitors for  to  the price of an Ipad. BTW, Apple might use old Ipad 1 parts in a refurbished Ipad 2."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "iPad2 64G wifi model\n\nPros: Very good image, light, small, great battery life, almost the 10hrs they claim, not just 3-4. Great for games, internet, books. Contains a standard iPod in it which is nice. Screen is sturdy enough to handle the constant cleaning/wiping you have to do without scratching.\nCons: Locks/apps freeze up regularly, needs a power off recycle to fix. Very poor wifi, constantly disconnecting regardless of wifi source, have tried many locations. With button on top, volume button is backwards, right is lower volume, left is higher which is opposite of the scale that pops up to show the volume level.\n\nOverall I spend more time getting it to work correctly than I do using it. It reminds of a circa 80s PC, maybe Windows 3.0 era. It is great for games, books, iPod because they are all internal. If it has to go externally to stream content, or send a message, etc that is when the problems develop.\n\nPeople complain constantly that it does not have a USB port. This is good because endless problems would develop from the use of endless attached devices, just like on PCs. Apple wants it closed for a reason, so it will work.\n\nBottom line, it is a toy, great for games, music and not nearly reliable enough to use for anything more important or demanding real time continuous stability."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Just bought a brand new 16GB iPad2 off Craigslist, and have some general comments...\n\nI found it quite difficult to get set up, it seems you have to connect the iPad to a PC or Mac and go from there (you get no manual, just a stupid little card with minimal info on it), which meant lots of figuring things out. Just the iTunes image alone that first appears on the screen when turning it on for the first time makes you go \"huh?\"  Maybe the Jr. High kids can blast through it, but it's harder for me (I'm 52) and I have a fair amount of computer experience.\n\nYou also have to input your credit card info! This means one thing...this machine is designed purposely to be a money hog for Apple and entertainment giants. It will have you buying all kinds of apps and music and entertainment to download from iTunes. Another step closer to being an automaton.\n\nNo USB port means Apple wants to control accessories and what you can input/output with the iPad, and that leaves you guessing, finding workarounds, and buying more stuff. But sure, it's also to minimize complications with external devices.\n\nThis machine is amazing, though, I got it for showing my work and upcoming interactive apps at conventions (I'm an artist). I can now carry around a portfolio of my work without the bulk. But to get photos on it properly you will have to buy an application for it. There are ways of getting photos uploaded without iTunes and buying photo apps (like emailing them to yourself and downloading them from there), but then the photo app it comes with leaves you without much capability to manipulate and organize them and put them in folders. There are literally no buttons/selections to control things with. This is obviously another manipulation to make you buy something more.\n\nLastly, if you want accessories (or even the iPad itself), go to Amazon or Craigslist, Ebay, friends, family--and buy them used, don't fork out $50 for a new protective cover, you can find a lot of these things used or cheaper than buying from Apple or manufacturers that don't care about the Earth and design products that end up too soon in the landfill.\n\nOverall it's a cool machine, but like me, with the way corporations/manufacturers plan and manipulate your pocketbook you might one day start to realize you're just a cog in the money machine for these corporate entities.\n\nWell, someone had to say it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I've postponed this review for a few months -- waiting to see how useful it would be after the newness wore off. So, the verdict is in:\n\nI put it in a black leather case and deliver sermons from it every week (written on a Mac and transferred to the iPad by \"Print to PDF\" at A5 size straight to a Dropbox folder, then transferred on the iPad from Dropbox to iBooks. It takes about 20 seconds). I prefer the iPad to printed sermon notes and wedding outlines because it's more easily hand-holdable, I can use a custom color scheme at no extra charge for ink, the print can be very large, I'm not wasting a bunch of paper, it's lighter, smaller, and more portable than a large-print Bible, and when talking to people after church I've got access to my calendar and address book so I can schedule appointments, get contact information, write reminders for that week's staff meeting, etc., -- all while standing in the foyer greeting members and visitors.\n\nI've also used it for presentations by connecting it to a vga projector input at the podium and utilizing the mirrored display. You aren't limited to Keynote for that although it does work well. But I've found it just as useful with iBooks, Bible software, and even YouTube player. The portability is fantastic -- disconnect the video adapter, slap the cover closed and walk away.\n\nDaily uses: mileage and expense tracking, keeping track of contacts, calendars & notes, video record-keeping, listening to Texas Rangers baseball broadcasts, web surfing, investment management, reading papers and books, and navigation. It's my favorite device for reading and responding to most emails.\n\nIt can stand in for a computer in a pinch, which it had to recently when my laptop was put out of commission for a few days by a lightning strike. Using various apps most of the data I need on a daily basis is automatically synced wirelessly between the iPad, iPhone, and MBAir, so I still had my complete calendar and all my appointments (iCal/Google combo), access to all my email (IMAP gmail), all my notes (Evernote), vital documents (Dropbox), and the ability to research and write sermons, articles, and class presentations. It's capable enough that I can get by with leaving my laptop at the office most evenings. Yea!\n\nIt's far more portable than even my MacBook Air. It's small and discrete enough to take into restaurants, tuck into the console in my car, and take into hospital waiting rooms without appearing insensitive to anxious family members. Instant on and off means you can pick it up to glance at the weather radar, or check an address, or take a note as easily as picking up an iPhone, but the size makes it much faster and easier to enter and view information. It's also large enough to share information with others around you.\n\nI use it daily and would replace it within a week if I lost it. 5 stars."}

It was new, flashy, fast, the charge lasted forever and all my friends wanted to play with it. After about a week or two, the battery didn't seem to stay charged as long. It wasn't that big of a problem though, because I was never far from a plug. When I got to Afghanistan is when I lost all respect for the iPad 2. The lack of constant signal caused apps and updates to half download which left permanent gliches in the programs and the main screen as well, that I cannot get rid of. Problems, that none of my friends with other brand's tablets had.

The lack of Flash is really a problem because there are still many sites that use Flash technology. Really, really annoying.\nAlthough printing is only possible with a select few Canon printers, I am not going out of my way to purchase a Canon printer just so I can print from my iPad.\n\nThe GOOD stuff:\nThe really great thing about this device is when you turn it on, Bam!  It's on.  No wait time, no boot up time.\n\niPad vs Kindle.\nInitially I bought the iPad as an e-reader because the experience is much superior when compared to the Kindle.  The touch screen is much more book like, turning pages with your finger is much more intuitive than pushing a button.  The scrubber at the bottom of the page so you can slide to any page, where as the Kindle you have to push a button or use the \"go to\" function and type in the desired page.  iPad lets you know what page and chapter name you're on rather than just a percent, the Kindle gives no chapter name or page number.  Every issue the Kindle has is addressed with the iPad.  The color screen is much better than the Kindle e-ink screen.\n***********************\n3G and GPS Chip.\nI am very glad I have these options.  When ever you want access the internet in remote areas via 3G, just go the \"settings\", cellular data and log in and turn on that option.  So for the next 30 days at $15 you have internet access.\nThe GPS chip is included with the 3G.  There are GPS apps for free, Waze and Motion X GPS Drive for purchase.  With the 3G option you need to turn on the Cellular Data in order for the GPS to work.\n\nWaze app is free and is pretty accurate but it did give me incorrect directions but it can only get better since the information is user generated.  Just driving around with Waze turned on generates information for other drivers.  It has voice guidance but does not give specific street names.  It is good in showing road conditions, traffic, hazards, etc....\n\nMotion X Drive app is 99 cents and just as good or better than Garmin.  It has many options and gives two different female voices for guidance, nothing really sexy.  It also states the street names but must be purchased for either $3 for 30 days or $20 for one year.  It also gives road conditions but Waze probably does a better job.\n***********************\nFaceTime\nThe Jetsons technology is here.

I returned the product for several reasons I felt to be valid:\n\n<1.>  It's still too heavy and it's not very ergonomic. This product is not comfortable for me to hold for long periods. I would say I'm of average strength (I can do 10 overhand pull-ups). I didn't purchase it to prop it up on a desk. I can use a laptop for that. The 10\" Android tablets I've held are too heavy too. I think I might be happier with a 7\" tablet.\n\n<2.>  A certain social networking app I use on the iPod all the time stinks on the iPad. I don't know why they couldn't come up with something better than: A. Open it iPhone size. B. Stretch it with a nasty 2x zoom that really displays poorly.\n\n<3.>  There are a ton of iPhone apps, not so much for the iPad. And the aforementioned problem keeps me from wanting to run iPhone apps on the pad. I don't want to have to fight with jail-breaking the device just to run an app full-screen. There do seem to be plenty of games, but I didn't get it for that.\n\n<4.>  It doesn't even include a calculator. Sure you can download a calculator from the app store. With the added bonus of a big iAd in the middle of the screen. I didn't know I was getting a $600 iPad with Special Offers.\n\nIn short I would not purchase this product without planning to jail-break it. If you do that I hear of all sorts of trouble with upgrades and, of course, no Apple support.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "When choosing which capacity iPad to buy, you should be aware of the following:\n\nFor many users, this 16GB iPad will be a great choice because, although you cannot expand its capacity, you can import files \"on-the-go\" with the following Apple accessory: the Apple Camera Connection Kit\n\nYou can use the Apple Camera Connection Kit (the SD card reader part) to import media files directly into your iPad, without the need to sync to iTunes.\n\nThis means you can bring along with you an almost unlimited number of media files, such as movies, mp3's, and photos.\n\nPerfect for a long trip, etc. Why not take along 100 GB or more? Fantastic!\n\nThere are a few details you need to know to import media files this way.\n\n1). Create a folder on any SD card and name that folder \"DCIM\".\n\n2). Place media files into the DCIM folder.\n\n3). Important: The media file names have to be exactly 8 characters long (no more, no less), or the iPad will not see them.\n\nExamples: 8letters.mp3, 8numbers.jpg, 8Numbers.mp4, TheBirds.mp4, Img_9001.bmp.\n\nThose are really the main details, but here are a few more:\n\nWhen you insert the Card Reader (one of two devices in the kit) into the iPad, with an SD card in it, in a moment the iPad screen will show thumbnails of all the media files on the card.\n\nYou can import some or all into the iPad. You cannot play media files from the card, you must first import them. To select some media files, just touch them to highlight them and choose \"Import\". Or, you can select \"Import All\".\n\nThe iPad will ask if you want to Keep or Delete (on the card). Be careful to select Keep (in most cases).\n\nValid video files need to be in the \".MP4\" format, version H.264. Or convert them to that format using almost any conversion program. I chose a size of 640 x 480, and it was perfect for filling up the screen.\n\nNOTE: the media files are imported into the \"Photo\" section of your iPad. Even the MP3's and Videos. So, to watch a movie, for example, select the Photo icon, not the Video icon on your screen (it won't be in the Video section).\n\nAND, you can delete any media files after playing them. That way, you can, for example, load a movie or two into the iPad, watch, then delete to make room for others."}

One of the reasons I love Apple products, whether it be the Iphone or the Ipad, is because of the apps. The new Ipad apps are AWESOME! Also the new Ipad games are pretty cool, also. The new Ipad 2011 still has a few minor issues but absolutely nothing to be concerned with. The new Ipad is so far above and beyond any other tablet out. One of the other cool things about the Ipad 2 is that it is similar to a regular laptop computer when it comes to updates. The new Ipad updates are sent to the tablet automatically, but you can also go online and get additional updates. The new Ipad 2011 also offers some sleek new designs in its covers. Very think and hardly noticable. I would strongly recommend the Ipad 2 over any other tablet on the market. The new Ipad 2011 is a winner in my book!!"}

It cuts out about 1 every 2 minutes, making the thing nearly worthless when doing anything online (which, for me, is about 70% of the time). What's the point? Apple claims this is a minor issue affecting only some users, but if you go on their support pages or google the issue, it is clear this is a very wide-spread problem."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "First, let me explain the 4 stars instead of five. I find the ipad too heavy to hold when reading. Perhaps that can't be helped. It certainly is not heavy in the real sense of the word. It's easy to carry with you anywhere. But to hold it upright for long periods like you do the Kindle is not what it was made for. So, I read my books on the Kindle.\n\nThat aside, I used to think the iPad was an expensive toy. I was wrong. I use it for my business and investments and have yet to play a game on it. I get streaming quotes and financial news and instant updates. Apple has so many apps that you'll find exactly what you want. I have lots of fitness and exercise apps that help me keep my health in check.\n\nLots of people have written in-depth reviews on the iPad and I'm not going to try and do the same thing. I merely want to say that this is a powerful device that can put power in your hands and add a lot to your business and personal life.\n\nApple support is decent but you can't get refunds for apps you don't like or that don't work for you. That's a major con and very much unlike Amazon. Also, Apple's site --- iTunes --- is hard to navigate. But those are the only cons I've found thus far.\n\nA word of advice: While 16gb is a considerable amount of space for books, etc, you may regret not getting more memory. I do. Just the apps alone (if you buy a lot of them as I did and most people do) take up lots of space. And video uses lots of memory. I didn't think I'd keep many videos on my iPad but I do. I'm now using about three-forths of my memory and I've only had the device about a month or less. I can assure you that next time I'll spend a bit more and buy more memory and you might want to consider that as well.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n- Susanna K. Hutcheson"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "It was with sadness that I returned it - felt like I was returning the Future. But here's why:\n1) It was too heavy for me to rest comfortably on lap while lying down.\n2) I had to purchase GoodReader to see if that would work for the main reason I wanted an ipad2 (to dowload and read academic pdfs from a certain website and zip files from another speciality website). I should have done this to see if it was compatable, but by the time I figured this out I had already invested so much time getting this to work right and had had enuf.\n3) Similarly, i would have to purchase a stylus to see if I could find one that worked for me. I'm used to using wrist movments and finger movements to work for long periods of time - not upper arm movements - so I would have to use a stylus. was not prepared cause I thought my styluses I already have would work on the IPAD\n4) Worst onscreen keyboard I have ever used. You have to hit a seperate key to make numbers and symbols like @ appear, and then hit the key again to return to letters. Perhaps i'd get used to this, perhaps not. so for, not.\n5) Similarly, if you can't touch type with the keyboard (you can't, I tried) then why space them out so far from one another? or why not let it be modifyable depending on the needs of the user?\n6) in the app store the print is too tiny. Much to my surprise, I could not expand it in the usual way. I did not bother to see if there was another way to expand it\n7) there's something dizzying about the way it switches between screens.\n8) Apple's official position is that they will not support WIFI conncections that use the older WEP security. Their only advice is to upgrade to WPA which they are happy to help you with excpet they don't care about the problem that then my older two devices would not be able to connect...So if have intermittant trouple with wifi because of WEP, don't count on Apples help. It took me ages to access some firmware to upgrade, only to find that i can't use WPA.\n9)In the store, the Ipad I tried got so dim as to be practically black. that's what I want for the dim lighting i use it in. My unit does not get as dim as that one. It's probably ok though.\n10) The final straw was an irrational one I guess...I decided to take a break from figuring things out and watch some stuff from NBC. I had not realized NBC does not support IPAD. the shows are on hulu but why shyould I pay 8 bucks a month when I can watch for free on my laptop. Other people have commented that they are going to start watching more ABC. I would rather find a table that lets me watch what I want.\n11)and ok, one more, i would also like to upload files to a speciality website, but didn't check to see if there's an app for that...\n12) I hate all the going thru ITUNES, a behmoth that now sits on my laptop, though i'd probably get used to this.\n\nOverall, Apple is really great at creating problems and then offering to sell you an App for that (no usb, no Word, no excel, can't upload or download files etc.). This is great if your main purpose is to show things to people. Big screen and without a cumbersome keyboard in the way.\n\nI might try and IPOD touch. same idea, but lighter. so now i'd still have to get goodreader and try again..."}

The email client and address book are integrated, so I can easily update email addresses in the address book.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "ok. so this is actually my second tablet review. my previous one was for the Motorola Xoom tablet that i chose over the iPad 2.\n\ni reviewed the Xoom and i stick to that review...it is indeed a great machine, but in about a week it started running slow and locking up on me. nothing too hardcore, but enough to make me think that, for the price, it should be better.\n\ni went back to best buy and picked up the iPad 2 which i had previously passed on and judged unfairly...in short, i was intimidated. PC's all my life and i knew nothing about apple products except that they were expensive and the most pretentious people liked them. and i stand by that.\n\nwell.....lets just say that the iPad 2 is just a amazing little machine. it took me awhile to figure out the whole system...it is different from a PC and not google-based. it is a transition...\n\nif your like me i can tell you honestly its a transition you would do well for yourself by taking.\n\ni am gonna compare the Xoom to the iPad 2 because it might be helpful and when i made my purchase i noticed alot of reviewers did the same...\n\n1- looks. iPad.its stunning. absolutely gorgeous. its art. no doubt. the Xoom is cool indeed, but the iPad has it hands down. don't mind paying more for that at all. you live once.\n\n2- speed. its incredibly fast. insane. and gotta give it up to the Xoom too...when it was running at full speed it was incredible too. both equal in my opinion.\n\n3- ease of use. Xoom has it all over the iPad 2. coming from PC's its a seamless transfer. google-based. tabs. etc...no worries. the iPad is completely new so the challenge is teaching yourself...BUT once you learn the way...MY GOD IT IS AWESOME.\n\n4- accessories and apps. iPad. all the way. no doubt. none. the apps are incredible. the accessories are ridiculously expensive for what they are but once you hold them...the quality is there. the Xoom has no real acessories to speak of..and the apps available are few and far between. that said...i didn't have any problem with normal use of the Xoom and i understand more are on the way...which is awesome.\n\n5- battery life. same. both rock. ten hours.\n\n6- screen. iPad 2. hands down. amazing and beautiful. the screen doesn't get nearly the amount of fingerprints as the xoom and the pictures are gorgeous. this is a non-issue. the iPad looks better in every way.\n\n7- ease of use. Xoom. really easy to use. intuitive.\n\n8- support. iPad. AppleCare is the best thing ever. ever. forget about it.\n\n9- photos. Xoom. the ability to store photos into catagories and switch them around is awesome. the iPad you just have one big place to put all of your pics.\n\nthat said 10- cameras. iPad.\n\n11 - cost. about the same. iPad maybe more with the applecare.\n\nand finally...\n\n12- set up. Xoom. all the way. plug it up and your good to go. the iPad you gotta sync with a PC and load up iTunes and jump a bunch of annoying hoops. that done though...MAN is it awesome.\n\nsooo....its a big purchase. i think both machines will do right by anyone. but if your looking for something artistic. dramatic. tough and secure go for the iPad. if your looking for something familar, comfortable and easy...the Xoom is for you.\n\nin conclusion....my iPad 2 is awesome. im glad i took the plunge and have no regrets. every day im loving it more and more...its amazing.\n\nim becoming pretentious now. i find myself silently judging others by their tablets and computers. i do and its awful. if you choose to get a iPad you will do the same thing. you need to be prepared for it....\n\nits a glorious feeling!!!!!

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The iPad 2 has got to be one the best things I have ever owned. In the start I thought I never \"needed\" just wanted it. But now I cant see myself not living without one. I hardly use my 17inch desktop replacement now. I only use it for certain tasks like downloading files, converting files, heavy typing tasks and pc gaming. I also hardly use my HTC Deire Android smartphone or iPod touch 3rg gen for surfing or apps any more when Im home. After trying many different tablets and reading many reviews and lastly just playing around with the iPad 2, I knew it was the best tablet on the market right now. Yes it does have many drawbacks if you compare it to the other tablets, but the it also has many great things about it and pros greatly outweigh the cons. Coming from an iPod touch i was already familiar with iOS. I also plan on getting an iPhone as my next smart phone. I prefer iOS over android and other operating systems for mobile devices. iOS just works and flows really well. Its really reliable and easy to use. Any body any age can pick an iOS device especially an iPad and just start using it right away, its just that easy. I do really wish the iPad 2 had flash but over time I got used to it. Also there are many work around for watching or using flash on the iPad 2. Their are at least 10 different apps/browsers that will allow you to use flash on your iPad 2. Also over time flash will die. It is a aging format, it drains too much battery and memory and its slow and most of all there's all sorts of security issues with it. I know since I use adobe flash on my htc desrie all the time. Also many websites, I would say as much as 75% of them offer 2 choices html 5 or flash versions of their website. I also wish the iPad 2 had a higher resolution screen. Many of the other android tablets do have a higher resolution. They also have better cameras, more ram and dual speakers. Regarding the screen I haven't noticed that the resolution is an issue right now any way all videos, web pages, apps and games look great on it. Also the speaker is gerat even though its just one on the bottom right, its still fairly loud and does the job. In terms of performance I don't find the iPad 2 slow in any way even though it has less ram than the other tablets on the market. Here is where the iPad 2 excels when compared to its competitors: The battery life is just crazy at 10 hours, yes at times I do wish the battery was removable so I could just swap another but its just really long lasting. The iPad 2 is supper light especially when compared to the other tablets or even the previous iPad. At first I found it a little on the heavy side and I do still wish it was a little bit lighter like around 1 pound, which Im sure the next will be. I think there is only one tablet which is lighter than the iPad 2 and that's the samsung galaxy tab 10.1. The iPad 2 has the best app store. It has the most apps, the best quality apps, and the developers make the apps for apple first before android, blackberry or windows 7 phone. Apple also has the largest store to purchase music, music videos, tv shows and movies. You can also rent movies on it. The iPad 2 has the best selection of games out of all the other tablets. Their are tons of games free and paid on the iPad 2. The iPad 2 just like any other product has huge number of third party accessories available for it. Apple has great customer service and a great warranty. I do have to warn you that when I received my iPad 2 in the first week of may. I had purchased it online from appples website and it was shipped to me in 3 weeks directly form the factory in china. I was aware that their maybe a backlight bleeding issue on some iPad 2s. It turns out mine had it and I wouldn't have known if I wasn't on the forums. I went into an apple store and the genius replaced it on the spot. Mind you I did get a refurbished model. But the refurbished replacement was flawless with no backlight bleeding and haven't had any issues with it yet. So I caution you to maybe wait until they say for sure that they have fixed the defect with all iPad 2s and then make the purchased. Or you can make your purchase now and see if you get a defective one or not. Overall I am very happy with my iPad 2. I do suggest going for highest memory option you can afford especially if your gonna use it for more than just browsing and email. The apps and games do add app and its always nice to have that extra storage available. Also if you can afford the extra $100 for the 3G connectivity I do suggest that also. That is one feature I wish I had got. I seem to use my iPad 2 mostly at home but when I'm out I do wish I have the 3G since I have to use my smartphone as a hotspot and use up its battery and data. If you get the one with 3G you can always just sign up for no contract data and just turn the plan on and off whenever you really need it with no commitments. Lastly, the iPad 2 does have the antenna gate issue which lowers the signal of the data connection of the device when holding it a certain way. I disappointed to hear this, but its seems these days almost any mobile device has some sort of issue like this. I have noticed it on my 2 ipod touchs and htc desire and now the iPad 2. It happens when you hold down on the speaker grill on the bottom left of the iPad 2. I have noticed it only drops the signal by one bar. So if I have 3 bars on wifi then it drops 2 bars. It there is only one bar then it doesn't drop the connection. I have also done a speed test and it slows down the speed by about one third. It never seems to affect streaming video or music for me. The iPad 2 is a great device I don't regret buying it all. I could just bought a cheap netbook but I a tablet. I was never even a fan of the iPad when it first came out, I thought it was just an over sized iPod touch which I already had. Also I was never a big follower of apple products, yes, I have owned a couple of iPod touchs but that's about it. I was also never a fan of the iPhone just found it over rated. But now after owning the iPad 2 for almost 3 months I can honestly say it is the coolest thing I have ever owned.\n\nDecember 2011 update: Well after owning the iPad 2 for about 7 months I can say its a great device but not good enough. The iOS 5 update made this worse in many ways especially battery life. The device is also more buggy now. Alot of the new features work but don't work right or all the time. I did update to 5.01 and battery life as improved but not to what it was before 5.0. I am anxiously awaiting a worthy tablet from google. The lack of flash, not having real multitasking, not being able to modify or customize my tablet in any way, not having micro sd card or usb ports really makes me wanna get an android based tablet. As soon as there is an android tablet that is just as good as the iPad 2 or better I will be getting it and selling this iPad 2. In the mean time I guess I will have to just deal with the limitations of an iOS device. Jailbreaking my iPad 2 did improve the usability of it alot but then I updated to iOS 5 and I no longer have a jailbreak. Jailbreaking still doesn't compare to the hack-ability and customization an android device is capable of especially if rooted.\n\nApril 2012 update: aftering owning my iPad 2 for almost a year now I am still very happy with it. When I first wrote my review I thought maybe the an android tablet would be better for me. Since then I tried the asus transformer prime and found out the grass is not greener on the other side. The asus prime was buggy, had all sort of glitches. I wasn't happy with the hardware or software especially after using an iPad. The lack of tablet specific apps was also very limited. The only thing I miss from the prime was the keyboard dock which provided extra battery life, extra ports and a hardware keyboard. There is still nothing like this for the iPad. All the keyboards are Bluetooth and end up draining the iPads battery quicker. There is the apple keyboard dock but only works in portrait mode and can only be used on desk or flat surface.\n\nThe iPad 2 is even better than before now since the price has been reduced to $400 and you can get a refurb unit for only $350. Personally I think the refurb should be $300. But $350 is still a great price and ofcourse people will still buy it at that price. I don't really see a point in upgrading to the newer iPad. I played around with it in the store and yes it did look better but only when you put the two of them next to each other. They say only people who use their iPad for videos and gaming will really benefit from the better screen. The newer screen is also suppose to reduce eye strain for reading.  The iPad is still the best tablet on the market and will continue to be so for a while at least until google finally gets their act together and produce a comparable tablet.  Androids lack of tablet apps and fragmentation is really killing and holding google back from competing with Apple."}

Very lightweight and sleek design.the cameras work extremely well in the light, in the dark it seems to be fuzzy. The other day there was a problem with the volume rocker and Apple did a very good job at helping me fix it. Now it works with ease. The battery is very very good it lasts 10+ hours sometimes if I use it correctly it will last days. This is the best tablet on the market. I'm actually writing the review on it now which brings me to the keyboard. It is very responsive and comfortable to type on. At first it is hard to type but once you get use to it you will type pretty fast. In fact I'm better at typing on this than on the computer. It is just so much easier.if you get this you will agree. The bad reviews are wrong. Those reviews were probably written by the companies with other tablets just trying to bring their tablet to the top and Apple's to the ground but it will NEVER HAPPEN. Apple is the best brand of technology out their. Don't hesitate to buy. They go very quick. Apple even shipped it quicker than 1 week. Than I got it in 1 week. Although I had to wait it was well worth it. I originally went with the xoom but it was to slow and was delayed. Plus the iOS software is just plain better and much simpler. The Apple iPad 2 is great for all people, chefs, business men and women, teachers,or even the stay at home mom. Always fun."}

Is there an astounding amount crammed into a small, considerably weight-reduced package? A resounding yes.  Are there some pretty impressive apps available for it?  Per this review's title, yes.  Is it a completely effective replacement for meaningful human contact?  No, but I'm reserving judgement for when generation 3 arrives with an optional mounting harness for love dolls.\n\nLook, its not perfect...realistically, it'll be a solid 4 or 5 years before a device in this price range can match the 160 gigs of an ipod classic with flash memory, and the dual core chip, while fine for day to day maneuvers, can lag in the more intensive tasks (not that there are many apps that convert things to DivX format or remotely control nuclear cooling towers).  Additionally, the lack of slots for SDHC or its 'micro' version knocks off a point or two for versatility.  Once data is on the thing, your only hope of exporting is via email or with third party software (and be REALLY careful to test it out with nothing crucial already installed, as there are some abysmal titles out there).  Also, I feel a decade of that proprietary cable is enough.\n\nGripes aside, this thing is a joy to use.  The battery is every bit as good as people claim, my average use per charge is right between 11 and 12 hours.  No screen protector was included, but aftermarket options are plentiful, and the matte finish option I tried produces an incredibly natural response, especially when using a stylus.  Need to entertain a child 1-3 years of age?  Furry Friend is a fantastic app, and less than 2 dollars in the full version.  Splashtop, though, is the primary component of the 5 stars.  Full version is fairly inexpensive (intermittently goes on sale for 1.99), and it has saved me both time AND monitor life; Splashtop is remote control for your PC or MAC...nothing new there, those in the IT world have been doing this for some time, and its one of the features advertised for Windows 7 in particular.  But the versatility is the selling point.  You could be stuck at an airport, and edit a slew of photographs, browse on Firefox with your home presets/favorites, access anything your home computer can access, all with intutitive touch controls.\n\nWith the sum of available science today, one could certainly design a device with more features and performance.  Sure it would cost a ridiculous sum, but ultimately, you get what you pay for.  I am a PC guy (only in computer preference), but I have to admit this is an impressive slab of glass and aluminum.  As for those claiming the purchase of an Apple product will designate you as a sheep or conformist, I applaud your staunch independence...just be sure you avoid any Meat, Fruits, Grains and Vegetables grown more than 50 miles from you, switch to a all-recycled burlap wardrobe, Handcraft your furniture from sustainably harvested logs downed with your own teeth, coat the whole thing with cruelty-free mud, and power your domicile with a small windmill and excercise bike hooked up to a homemade turbine.  Also, avoid all non-leg-based transportation.  Then you can be a true pioneer!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "My husband talked me into buying an ipad2 after listening to one too many complaints about my Droid phone. So I dumped the \"smart\" phone, reverted back to a \"dumb\" phone and got an ipad. I just love it! It's small and light - fits in most of my purses without a problem. I carry it around all the time - has my grocery list, my address book, photos of my grandchildren, my calendar, my favorite music, maps & GPS and links to my ebay auctions. It has Angry Birds to keep me amused while waiting at the doctor's offce. It has Pandora radio, which is AWESOME! It has a screen I can actually SEE and a keyboard I can actually USE! No more struggling trying to do things on that stupid \"smart\" phone. AND it never calls anyone by accident like the Droid used to do. A lot...\n\nI have a laptop at home for my business use, so I didn't expect it to be a substitute for that. But when I am shopping on ebay, it's much more pleasant to sit on the couch with my little ipad than to sit at the desk with the laptop.\n\nI find it works seamlessly with wi-fi and Verizon wireless. I got the $20/month 1 gig plan and it's plenty for me. I bought a docking station with speakers, so my stereo just became completely obsolete. The battery life is outstanding - especially when compared to my laptop.\n\nThe only thing I am not wild about is the Itunes interface. It has taken me quite a bit of fussing to master the art of getting stuff transferred over to the ipad. But I've got it down pat now - thanks to a little extra help from an Apple customer support rep.\n\nIn short - you can have my ipad \"when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers\"."}

Apple should have replaced it and sent us a new while they fixed our lemon of an ipad. We have been apple customers for 3 mo, not so impressed with their customer service.

It wasn't untill a cople of weeks ago I did some heavy research on tablet pc'. Comparing different models ect. What made me ultimately get the ipad was all the reviews I read on it vs the play book, and the samsung galaxey tablet. I really find that I use it every day, and that was one of my biggest concerns. I play games on it, have a bunch of books I love on there,  as well as music, besides web surfing, I use it as a personal journal. I don't regret my purchase and it was worth every cent. However I don't recommend.buying the smart cover. It doesn't give enough coverage, instead I purchased a product from hear called roo case and I love it! I also got a anti-glear screen protector.

So I replied on the mail by saying, Why? I purchased from you, so you should handle this case with your supplier (which in this case is Apple). But that did not help much, I really needed to contact Apple online store to solve this problem. So I did! To make a long story short, 3 weeks later and I finally have a new iPad2.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The iPad2 64GB 3GS (\"iPad2\" in this review) really is a nice-to-have device.  For various reasons I did not have an original iPad despite wanting one, so this review will focus on the iPad2 and not the differences between the two generations.\n\n1.  Screen.  The Screen on the iPad2 is gorgeous.  HD movies really do look HD, and the iPad2 provides a very satisfactory viewing experience.\n\n2.  Battery life:  Very good.  Despite moderately heavy \"on the road\" use, I have never managed to run my battery even to 50%.  Others are reporting 11-12 hours and this is consistent with what I am seeing.  Apple did a good job with this battery, and the overall power management of the iPad2.  I have my screen set to auto-dim (where the screen adapts to the lighting in the room) and no doubt this helps.  I have never needed or wanted to fiddle with the screen using this setting.  Ordinary Apple chargers work fine to charge the iPad2 battery.  However, many computer USB ports do not have enough juice to charge the iPad2.  My main Windows computer does not; not even from a powered USB hub.  Many third-party chargers for the iPhone turn out not to work with the iPad2 although all of the Apple ones I have tried do, and some of the after-market ones do.  So far my experience has been that if they sold it in the Apple store, it works.\n\n3.  Browsing the web.  The iPad2 is peerless for just plain web browsing, and this is what it excels at.  The virtual keyboard is OK for short email messages or filling in fields on websites.  For more heavy duty typing, there are a number of fine outboard keyboards out there.  I was delighted to find that my Apple Bluetooth Keyboard works splendidly with the iPad2 and for road trips I pack it along.\n\n4.  Cameras.  There are two; front and back.  They are exactly what you would expect: OK for quick snapshots, but a lens a fraction of an inch in diameter is not going to take the place of a real camera; we all know that.  They work reasonably well for what they are.  I have not yet tried the various videophone applications so I cannot speak to that.\n\nThe iPad2 is thin and easy to carry.  The Apple case, which many people buy, is nice to have, but it does not protect the back of the iPad.  There are any number of aftermarket leather or other kinds of cases that provide the iPad2 with more protection.  Most of these will cause the iPad2 to power down when the front flap is closed, just as the Apple cover does.  This is a very nice feature.\n\nThe iPad2 has infinite professional and personal uses.  I can have it in the courtroom (I am an attorney) and look up cases on-line quickly and snappily using the 3GS, since most courtrooms do not provide counsel with Wi-Fi.  Email, Web access, etc., these things are all becoming a fundamental part of our lives.  I used to use my iPhone for portable Web access, and it was OK for that, but the iPad2 with its larger screen is infinitely better for this.  In my life Web access wherever I go is the main use for the iPad2, and it is a critical use.\n\nMy main negative on the iPad2 are these: 1.  No dedicated USB2 port.  Why not? 2.  The lack of a USB port makes it very difficult to print anything with the iPad2 and for some reason Apple does not make printing easy, or hardly even possible.  Apple flat-out does not encourage or want its iPad2 users to print off of their iPads.  Whether they are trying to protect their notebook sales or there is some other reason, I do not know.  Eventually I anticipate that competition and pressure from the user base (me!) will force Apple to relent on this.\n\nIn the 21st century, devices like the iPad2 are destined to become a fundamental part of our personal kit.  The iPad2 is beautifully made, and for most of us very much worth having.  Highly recommended.  RJB."}

I am returning this thing and investing in some software for my PC that will actually benefit my business. Technology wise it is savy, very impressive. But functionally from a professional stanpoint it is seriously lacking. Although the tablet boasts of thousands of APPs most of them are not suited for professional use. I am also a musician and couldnot find one darn APP that was useful for a serious musician. So from an Arts and media perspective this thing is a waste of money.

After communication with the vendor, we learned it is necessary to \"activate\" the ipad by plugging it in to an internet-connected computer with subsequent connection to itunes. However, even after \"activation\" there are still no instructions as to how to set basic things up such as email. My husband ended up taking it in to his tech people to set up basic needs, and this has taken a large amount of time and work (and still is not complete over a month later with multiple people involved).\n\nThis is disappointing since the unit cost over $1,000. Surely, basic setup instructions should be included for an item of this value!!!\n\nPerhaps buying an ipad from this vendor might be good for those of you already highly knowledgeable in how to set an ipad up. For the rest of you, do even consider buying here. Go to an Apple store or to another source that offers basic installation instructions and help. My iphone works great, but I bought it from an Apple store where all my questions were answered up front. I wish I had bought this ipad from the same store.\n\nBottom line: the hardware coming from this vendor is probably fine. There is no set up help or instruction,however, so avoid this vendor unless you already know what you need to do.\n\nWe cannot yet review the ipad itself since it is not yet set up after many weeks of trying."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Intro: I've always been a fan of Android and prefer it to iOS, but I must admit that at the moment, Apple has the best tablet on the market. After trying to decide between the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and iPad 2, I pulled the trigger on the iPad 2 (16GB, Wi-Fi, Black) and have yet to regret my decision.\n\nPros:\n*Apps - The best feature about the iPad is the App Store, and this was the deciding factor for me. On a smartphone, there's a bit more to consider than apps (call quality, carrier, camera quality-in my opinion, pointless on a tablet-,etc.), but on a tablet, it's all about the functionality delivered through tablet-optimized apps.\n*Design - The iPad 2 is very thin, light, and has a nice aluminum finish on the back. The only comparably sized tablet is the Galaxy Tab 10.1.\n*Screen - The screen is great, especially in terms of quality and contrast. It's a 9.7\" IPS screen with a 1024x768 resolution.\n*Battery life - Excellent. It has the best battery life of tablets (Galaxy Tab 10.1 comes close). To get an idea, it lasts for days with some gaming/web browsing each day.\n*Accessories - Because the iPad is basically the epitome/name-brand of tablets at the moment, if there's a tablet accessory, it's compatible with the iPad.\n*Resale value - If I decide to sell it later to upgrade to the inevitable iPad 3, I know it will maintain most of its value.\n\nCons:\n*Cameras - Although I will probably never use them, the cameras on the iPad 2 are horrible.\n*Screen - Competitor tablets have a bigger 10.1\" screen, but my biggest complaint is the lower resolution of the iPad (1024x768 vs 1280x800). The resolution difference is more important because it would've allowed for more content to be displayed which is espeically important for web browsing.\n*Apple's proprietary ports - The non-standard ports lead to some overpriced adapters and accessories.\n*Apple's \"walled garden\" aka iTunes - To most people this isn't a big deal, but some people will be annoyed about having to use iTunes. Personally, I don't mind iTunes, but I hate only having Apple-approved apps available in the App Store. Luckily, for those who care, like me, you can just jailbreak your device."}

Heck, I taught my grandmother how to use it in an hour and she has no grasp of technology whatsoever.\n\nCustomize\nOne can customize the placement of their applications based on how often that one uses them, by category, by favorite, or however ones wants, you can completely customize the order of your apps.\n\nCamera and Weight\nThe IPad 2 is thinner then its predecessor as well as lighter, it also includes a front and rear camera which makes video chatting via Facetime efficient. However, the quality of these cameras are nowhere near the standards that one expects to see from a piece of technology, especially at the price that Apple charges. Apple cites that the small mega-pixel camera is the result of a thin design, which I understand. I do not use my IPad to take pictures, I do however carry it everywhere. It's thin and light design enables me to slip it in to that last little space of room in my backpack without adding much weight.\n\nMedia and Graphics\nFor those of you that are on the go, you can use the IPad for games, music, videos, and even writing word documents. I however, do not like watching movies on my IPad, because any movie that comes from Itunes is only in wide screen format which makes the actual movie frame very small. That and the not so great quality of movie graphics, makes me reluctant to do so. The graphics on the IPad 2 are good when not watching movies, when watching they are are not terrible but they are not great, and can be vastly improved.\n\nThe Keyboard\nWhat bothers me the most about the IPad 2 is the keyboard, the letters are shrunk so that the keyboard can fit, but it was not done proportionally. The lack o  a quick transition between symbols, numbers, and letters makes note taking inefficient on the IPad 2."}

If you are going to use Verizon 3G, then I would recommend that the IPAD be purchased directly from your local Verizon shop.  This will insure that the unit is working properly before you pay.

Would you like to watch videos you already own on a mobile Device without hours of re-encoding to Apples proprietary format for each video you want to watch?\n\nWell then don't buy Apple products because they have the same IRON Grip on every one. I own Apple products (luckily I didn't have to buy them all my job did) and I've been sorely disappointed with every one. Apple products have not Flash support, no Java support, and no support for almost any video formats that are not Apple proprietary.\n\nIf you want a mobile pad that plays almost any video I would suggest the Asus Eee pad both support flash, and both support Java, so that means online streaming sites work, and online flash games work. (two things Apple don't want you to be able to use so you have to get videos and games from them.)\n\nNow I can't speak for the Galaxy (though I've heard good things) but the Asus Eee pad is great for video. To watch video on the Asus Eee pad you plug in the pad, it comes up as a drive, you drag your video files to the Asus pad, and then you watch them without having to re-encode. This pad has played every video file I've tried. Be smart get almost anything other than an Ipad, you'll be happier not being told what you can do, and what to buy, that is ALMOST as good as what YOU actually want to do with a product YOU spent money for.\n\nAnd remember don't drink the Apple Kool-aid and don't listen to the brainwashed hype of the Apple sheep who tell you to stay in the heard."}

The screen is great for reading in dark and well lighted areas and the text unless very small is easy to read. The OS is amazing and will only get better with ios 5 the apps such as evernote make the iPad the perfect notebook to read notes on etc. Battery life is incredible I can easily go 3-4 days without needing a recharge however I get 10-12 hours with constant use. If you truly want to use the iPad to it's full potential I recommend getting a smart cover it doesn't interfear with docks and cleans the screen as well as works as a great stand. The only downside I can think of is the keyboard it's awkward to use at times and can make you want to shorten or leave out words to type faster (using iPad now). I highly recommend getting an MacBook air and iMac if you can afford it. Using several computer setups I have never found a setup that just works like these 3 put together.\n\nUPDATE: iOS 5 brings many more features students will love such a document sharing and iCloud backup over wifi after a full quarter using this device I have had zero issues and my battery still gets around ten hours of actual use before dying on me."}

Figured since you are not bound by a contract, (ie. 2 years to subscribe) I would get the 3G just in case I ever wanted that feature. You cannot upgrade. If I were to go on a trip, I could subscribe to 3G for a month and then cancel. THAT is AWESOME."}

The lightness and portability is cool, and it seems rather seamless until I went to use on my work websites...then oh no, they wouldnt work. Well, I went looking for apps....and guess what, there aren't any for those websites. UGH! No updates, apps, or workarounds. Im stuck using it for emails and some websites, and a few apps. My mistake as I should have known they used Flash. Im just glad I didn't buy a 3G model or I really would have tossed more cash in the fire. I should have done better research, but figured there would be some sort of workaround, but there is not as of now. I would have been much better off with another of the competitors that used flash.\n\nAlso there is very limited expandability. This is more of a gadget and not a computer or even a netbook. At least I can get on websites and use it with a netbook.\n\nIt will allow me to stay connected through emails and some do some slow surfing, but thats really the extent of it.\n\nThis is a very sad disappointment for business use...."}

Even w/ tutorials, lots of info re how to download ($),but no basics like how to access and play the music you have downloaded. Took LOTS of trial and error to figure out.\nOn the up side, having a store nearby to take 1:1 classes is wonderful, and will learn much in short order.\nOne other concern, I downloaded Sketchbook Pro to learn to draw in the computer. Present iPad technology requires a stylus pen w/ an eraser tip for iPad to \"read\" the marks you make. Any way to make a different type of interface sensitivity (pressure  vs electrical charge of skin) to enable a finer tip as needed? Yes, one can choose tips and brushes, but requiring so much surface of the eraser tip to create a line seems inefficient. Perhaps a wacom tablet would have been a better choice.\nOverall, it is amazing to have music, mail, drawing, search, calendar etc in such a small package.  The problems...no doubt more my abilities than the product."}

Actually, I'm a PC person and I have ALOT to learn about using the Apple technology, but so far, I think it's been worth diving into.  The camera has very good resolution and even I was able to take some good movies. I bought this instead of a laptop because I find the touch screen to be soooo intuitive.  I think that's really the best part.  I had a little trouble getting the email system up and running because I'd ordered it through the internet and there's not an Apple Store nearby to set up the product initially.  However,it comes with several months free telephone help and the tech person who assisted me was very patient, skilled and spoke impeccable English. My biggest issue is the delicate touch and size difference of the keyboard compared to a laptop but I am getting real fast at hunt and peck typing- though I may consider buying an auxillary keyboard.  I would definitely recommend the IPAD 2.\nBernardette Costa\nAuthor, The Six Colorful Annies"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I love my Ipad2. It is fast, very reliable and stable, and just plain fun.  But there are a few things that keep it from being perfect.  First, as other reviewers have commented, the camera is the pits and really not up to Apple's ususal outstanding quality.  The second issue, in my opinion, is the slick aluminum back side material.  It looks pretty but really necessitates a case because it is slippery and without a means to get a better grip, it is only a matter of time before the inevitable fall.  I found the same problem with my Iphone.  It would be a much better devise if Apple used a rubberized type material on the back.  I spent alot of time comparing the Ipad2 with the Motorola Xoom at Best Buy before making my purchase, and I really don't think you could go wrong with either tablet.  The Xoom has a far better camera and does flash which might be a big plus if you are really into video and gaming. But flash also comes at a cost in performance and stability which is exactly why Apple doesn't use it.  The Ipad2 seems more intuitive to me and just seems to work better and do things quicker. But I have to admit that my familiarity with Iphone may partly influence my opinion on that point. Ipad also has many more apps available at the moment. One other drawback though,in my opinion, is the need to tether the Ipad to Itunes. I understand their logic, but I really wish it had a simpler PC-Ipad interface. Honestly if I didn't already have an Iphone I might have been inclined to buy the Xoom, but that's not taking anything away from the Ipad2 - it is a great tablet!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "By now there are plenty of reviews that offer the pros and cons of the iPad 2 versus other tablets on the market.  With that in mind, I've decided to focus this particular review only for those of you who are in the same boat as me - which is debating whether or not to upgrade to an iPad 2 from the first gen iPad.\n\nAfter giving it much thought, I recently took the plunge and I am 100% sure that I made the right decision.  However, this is only in the context of how I use the tablet, which is primarily for gaming and other graphic intensive apps.  Previously I owned the AT&T 3G iPad with 32GB of memory.  After giving it much thought, I decided to purchase the wi-fi only 64GB iPad 2, since I realized I don't actually used the 3G much.\n\nMost of the apps I use are very graphic intensive.  EA games such as Dead Space, FIFA 11 ... or Gameloft games such as Order & Chaos, Starfront, and Dungeon Hunter ... I play those games often and noticed a HUGE difference after I transferred my data to the iPad 2.  The games run much better, and there is a major change in terms of performance.  There is much less slowdown, and FIFA 11 actually plays like the way it should - fast and crisp (and not slow and turgid, like it was when I was playing the exact same game on the first gen iPad).  In cases like this - having the faster processor and added RAM makes a huge difference.\n\nNow if you're the kind of person who plays simpler, less graphic intensive games like Angry Birds, Diner Dash or World of Goo, you will probably not notice anything different.  You also won't really notice any difference if you stream or purchase videos as the display is the same as before.  Sorry, but no retina display this time around.\n\nBut what you will be pleased with is the fact the iPad 2 is far lighter than it's predecessor.  This is important for those of you who spend a lot on the iPad playing games (like me).  It was no secret that the previous iPad was bulky and difficult to hold.  It also made it very tiring to grab the device for an extended period of time (making it difficult to play intense FPS or sports game without frequent rest periods).  The iPad 2's weight makes it much easier to hold and less burdensome to play games for a long time.  Long story short, my hands don't feel numb as often as I did when I used the old iPad.\n\nAs for the other bells and whistles such as the camera/face time, etc ... all of that is well and good.  The interface is easy to figure out, so there isn't much brain surgery involved.  The smart cover is also a nice touch, though it's not a necessity.  I personally have one though, and I like it very much.\n\nSo the biggest question here is - should you upgrade to iPad 2 if you already own one?  If you are a die hard gamer, the answer is 100% absolutely yes.  The difference in performance is absolutely striking and you will see the benefits of upgrading within seconds (so long as you play games that take advantage of the upgrade - i.e. games w/high production value).\n\nEven the apps I run outside of games run noticeably smoother and faster.  Using video/graphic intensive apps like CNN or ESPN XL is a snap, and they run much faster than on my previous iPad.\n\nIn short, should you upgrade from the iPad to the iPad 2?\n\n1. If you play hardcore, graphic-intensive games - YES, upgrade ASAP\n\n2. If you run a lot of apps at the same time, like to use video/graphic intensive apps - YES, upgrade\n\n3. If you run apps that aren't that taxing (lighthearted games like Angry Birds, simple interface apps), or use the ipad to mostly surf, write email, etc - NO, upgrading is not necessary unless you have cash to spare (save your $$ for the iPad after the iPad 2 IMO).\n\nThat's my 2 cents for folks on the fence.  Good luck!"}

Two weeks later I'm kind of disappointed.\n\nI have had a couple of issues with this device, biggest one being serious issues with wifi connectivity. Apparently this has been a common issue for ipad 2. I found a fix for mine, which is to say its not complete junk, but definitely an inconvenience to go through all the steps again and again to fix it. The other issue is I keep having audio problems...sometimes when muted it cant unmute itself and I have to restart it in order to get my audio working again. The camera picture quality is not great, in fact its useless. The video quality is decent in good lighting, very usable if you can really see yourself taking video with a 10 inch tablet. The device isn't heavy for me, but my older mother found it heavy for her to hold after only using it for 5 minutes, which is why I would also recommend getting the smart cover for it..it can turn into some pretty useful sturdy positions for typing, reading, or watching video.\n\nThe positives of this device, I was surprised at how great the screen would be. I thought it would scratch easy or be high maintenance...but its been really easy to keep clean with a small microfiber cloth (not included). Apps load fast, graphics are nice, and perfect for netbook replacement as long as you don't do a ton of typing. Its great for social media and web browsing, but i would NOT use this as an ebook reader, your eyes start to hurt after reading for awhile. Get the kindle for that.\n\nI think the app store is slightly over hyped, i have found two unique apps that i couldn't have got for an android tablet...but overall the most popular apps seem to be on both devices."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I bought the original iPad on \"day 1\", and have really enjoyed it for over a year now. When iPad 2 came out, I thought it was a nice evolutionary step, but not enough for me to upgrade.\n\nHowever, the seemingly small changes do turn out to make a difference.  For example, one of my favorite uses of the original iPad was to read various newspapers and blogs while having breakfast. That worked pretty well, but the limited memory of the original iPad caused web-pages to rarely be cached: Following a link and then hitting the \"back\" button felt a bit sluggish. With iPad 2, this scenario works a lot better. Similarly, FaceTime and video Skype support were attractive to me, but I figured that having an iPhone 4 already would largely mitigate the advantage of having the feature also on iPad.  Well, the larger size of iPad 2 makes it much more natural to have my daughter join alongside of me in a conversation with overseas family members. The small weight and dimension differences also have a disproportional effect. My kids use a drawing app that also seems to benefit from the added hardware capabilities (memory-bound, I think) and GarageBand is even more impressive on iPad 2 than its already remarkable power on my original iPad.\n\nI had a chance to try some other tablets (Xoom, 7\" Samsung, and Nook color), but at this time they're far behind iPad in just about every respect (the Nook color's low weight is nice though). The Xoom's screen has odd dimension when web-browsing or reading (it's nice when watching certain movies, but the experience improvement is small compared to the the reduced experience for most other applications, including non-wide-format videos). The smaller Samsung device indeed feels quite small, and, like the Xoom, it's missing nice applications in just about every major category.  Nook color is the least of all these alternatives, but perhaps the most attractive considering its lower price and light weight."}

The iPad's various styli, with their resistant, rubbery \"nubs,\" still leave much to be desired).  Yet, overall there would appear to be few if any viable alternatives at this stage.  Apple was first to the parade and, according to practically every review of the latest model (including that most popular consumer's magazine), continues to remain in the top position.\n\nThe primary advantage of the Apple 2--from my perspective--would appear to be the lighter weight and more compact size.  Personally, I found the iPad 1 to be hot and heavy compared to my Air 11\", which I now use for practically all of my computing.  So be sure to take note of screen size and overall weight of any other device you may be considering before ordering.  Also, note that the highest-rated tablet on Amazon (the Toshiba) has yet to be released!  If you're considering it, it would seem overly hasty if not reckless not to wait for it to \"test out\" on the market for a few months.\n\nAs for the iPad, the Flash controversy proved a non-issue for my wife and me.  The lack of certain ports--for HDMI, USB, display, etc.--was never anything that couldn't be addressed and fixed with a readily available adapter.  Finally, look for any other machine that comes close to the iPad in terms of the galaxy of available \"apps.\"  The lack of a keyboard (true of most any tablet) can also be addressed--but now we're getting close to a Macbook Air, which strikes me as the more practical purchase in the first place.\n\nIn short, there's every reason to spring for another iPad (if you like the concept in the first place) and a number of reasons to withhold purchase of any other brand.  But a caveat: this is one of the few times that I've found a product sold through Amazon to be significantly higher in cost, even without sales tax, than the same product purchased through Apple Store.\n\n[As a musician, I've found a reason to like this device: it can be loaded up with musical scores (several life-times' worth) and set on a stand or piano ledger, the equivalent of a giant-sized cabinet full of notated music contained within a thin, easily readable and navigable tablet.]"}

Now I hardly use my iPod Touch 4 since the keyboard is so much bigger and easier to use. I use it mostly at work on the WiFi network to access sites that are blocked on the company's PC network, for example email accounts I have. At home I love playing the games, using it with my Apple TV to play music and video.\n\nTHE COOL:\nThe iPad2 is wicked fast.\n\nApps are awesome. So many cool games. Adrenal Golf, War Pinball, Plants vs. Zombies\n\nApps that use GPS are cool. 4 square, Yelp, Google maps\n\nApps for video chat, Skype and FaceTime is way cool. I chat with my friend who has an iPad2 300 miles away over our WiFi networks and the performance is near flawless. He called me on FaceTime from a train station in Beijing and from a Starbucks in China. Truly amazing.\n\nApps for social networking. Facebook, 4 square, twitter, Flipboard is way cool\n\nApps for news, Fox, CNN, Free video from Crackle, Netflix if you have it\n\nAir Video is way cool - you can play movies in different formats to your HDTV using Apple TV or the HDMI adapter.\n\nDlink has a security app that allows me to view a webcam in my house from anywhere I have Internet.\n\nTextfree for iPad for texting.\n\nNOT SO COOL:\nThe smart cover with magnets is cool but it's a bit awkward and takes a bit getting used to.\nThe back camera is very low resolution but what are you going to do use an iPad to take photos?\nThe speaker isn't that great. I bought some SoundMatters little speakers which are pretty cool.\n\nOverall I'd highly recommend it."}

The iPad2 arrived in two weeks.  I paid no sales tax and no CA recycle fee.  They sell all models.\n\nThis was a great experience.

I informed Amazon hoping they would add the Signature required in their tracking info."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have the 64GB with AT&T 3G.  I absolutely love my iPad.  It does everything and i've been impressed with it in the 2 months that i've owned it so far.  I use it primarily as my internet browser, an e-reader, and to stream Netflix.  It's a revolutionary  product for me.  The iPad has replaced my laptop as my go-to for internet.  I no longer take my laptop with me on business trips.  The iPad does everything I need.  It doesn't replace the need for a computer, but it does allow me to travel without my laptop and to leave the laptop in the office (or the kitchen where it usually lives) when I want internet access on the couch.\n\nHere are some of the key features that I use:\n\nThe web browser is the real deal.  It's full internet and not a mobile browser.  I like surfing the web on my iPad better than on my computer because the touch screen and gestures are very intuitive.\n\nFacetime and Skype look great and are easy to use with the dual cameras.  It's nice to be on the road and be able to see my daughter any time I have an internet connection (Facetime requires WiFi, but you can Skype on the 3G).\n\nAs an e-reader, I haven't used it to read a full book yet, but I do often use iBooks to crunch PDF files that I use for work.  It allows you to search and bookmark.  The bookmarks then transfer to your iPhone via MobileMe.  It's nice because I have literally thousands of pages of regulations and tech orders at my fingertips in a very portable format.  The backlight screen is nice when reading in a dark environment and I've found it comfortable to use when reading for 15-20 minuets.  I haven't read any longer than that, so I don't know if it will cause eye fatigue over a longer period.\n\nVideo looks great.  64GB is plenty of space.  I'm currently carrying 17 movies, about 11 GBs of music, 10 GBs of Apps, all of my books and I still have about 20 free GBs to load anything else.  I could probably have gotten away with the 32 GB model.\n\nNetflix streaming is awesome!  They have a great selection and the app looks really good.\n\nGames on the iPad are really fun.  I have a few board games and you can sit across from someone and use the iPad as your Monopoly board.  The large display makes it a pretty social device.\n\nThe news apps look really good and have the feel of reading a magazine.\n\nPros - It does everything.  It looks good, is very light and the battery performance is fantastic.  Apple's claim of 10 hrs of use is true.  The battery really lasts a long time.  The 3G service is a good deal.  I don't always use it, so you can set the 3G up to \"pay as you go\".  If you need to use the 3G, you can enter your credit card info right into the iPad and sign up for a month of service.  It's $15 for 250 MB and $25 for 2GB.  You can cancel without a penalty and there's no long term commitment.\n\nCons - Price.  The iPad is expensive, and you could buy a laptop for the same price (or cheaper).  It's a great device and I think it's worth it, but the price is pretty steep.  Lack of Flash support, which is common to all iOS devices.\n\nOverall, I really love my iPad, I use it for everything and I take it with me routinely."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I've done a ton of research on tablets, and ultimately decided on the iPad 2. I like the customization of android, but in the end it came down to the stability and the vast amount of apps. Before considering buying an iPad I was wondering why people would not shut up about how many apps there are, well now I really do get it. While some of them aren't very useful for me, there are quite a few i would say that are very well designed and extremely useful and just plain entertaining.\n\nI really hated the fact that there was no flash, and no true multiple tasking, but after taking a chance on the iPad I realized I really didn't notice the flash too much, however, the lack of true multitasking can be frustrating at times. The iOS definitely needs an update, but for the first time user it will be a pleasurable experience.\n\nThe quality of the ipad is incredible, and the experience from startup to actually using the device was impressive to say the least. The screen is beautiful and the screen is extremely responsive. Oh, and not to forget, the battery life is unreal at a true ten plus hours of browsing and streaming video and audio.\n\nThe Internet browsing experience is very nice, I've had no issues at all. The web pages render perfectly and overall is a blast to use ( even without flash).\n\nI would whole heartily recommend the iPad 2 to anyone seeking a device that allows you to browse the web, check email, play games, check and pay bills, loves creating anything at all, or just wants to sit on the couch and watch some Netflix. The iPad isn't flawless but at this price it is very fair for what you get. If you are looking to totally replace your laptop, it's possible, but it just depends on what you really use it for. I personally replaced my laptop with this device and never looked back.\n\nHope this helps."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The iPad 2 is a nice step up from the first generation iPad.  The new thin design only is a reason to select the 2nd generation model over the first.  Much more like a tablet than the first one, the new sleek design is lighter and feels much better in your hands.  Of course the camera is a big difference and it allows you to do things like Skype.  There are some other changes like a doubling of the RAM size, but those first two features are the ones that will immediately jump out at you.  After that, it operates the same as the first generation iPad and is truly one of the cooler tech devices out on the market."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I recently purchased a new iPad 2 for $829.99. I had such high hopes for this little device. Then was astonished at how it didn't even come close to my medium-low expectations.\n\nHere it goes:  The auto rotate is slow and suddenly will rotate when tilted randomly. When you don't have the wall plug-in it will not recharge while plugged into a laptop. The touch pad is either so sensitive or will NOT work At ALL after many attempts. Apple says it has a 10hr battery life - try five hours at best. A data package must be bought to use the Wi-Fi when the advertisement says it can be used right out of the package. You have to buy iTunes comparable packages to use the iPad. Free Apps are NOT all free - there is usually a fee to make them work to the point they are enjoyable. Don't even try to upload ANY of your own music or movies. Apple is sooo proprietary that if you didn't buy the music or movies through iTunes you can't use it on the iPad. And when you try to access the Internet, better-off using your Mac/PC. Moreover, accessing Wikipedia or nearly any other sites that uses videos to enhance the info, entertainment, music you can only watch around 70% of the content. Sure, the Flash is not available for iPad but it should be able to play the other videos. On Aug 5th, I called Mac customer service and the rep even said he could not believe Apple sent out the iPad 2 without some kind of plug-in or app to make the iPad more user friendly with the Internet. Oh, one more, DO NOT set the iPad face down or it will slip off nearly any surface you think is flat. The front surface is so slippery.\n\nI don't have the time to list and all negative experiences have been experienced only owning it for three months. However, I must say, the screen is bright and clear. The iPad is light and sturdy. The apps that do work, work VERY well. The processor is extremely FAST! It is not a horrible product. It just needs to mature a little.\n\nI have been using Apple/Mac and PC products for more than three decades and could not speak higher of the quality and ease of use of Apple/Mac until now. I'll probably be buying a different brand like a HP Slate 500, LG G-Slate, Viewsonic ViewPad 7, RIM BlackBerry PlayBook - to name a few next time unless I pad 4 is more compatible with reality. Please, for the love of all good things, heed my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS! (At least not yet.) Nearly ANY other pad/tablet at two thirds the price will do much more than the iPad 2.\n\n* NOTE * DO NOT BUY THE iPad magnetic Smart Cover. It easily slips off and WILL traumatically send your iPad to an early demise.\n\nNo, I would not recommend this to a family member or friend at this time. Remember, we are at the very beginning of the pad/tablet generation! Every year as the Internet develops, the tablets will follow. Good luck!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I held out a month or so before making the decision to buy an iPad2 32G model. After a month of frequent use, I must say it is the nearest to perfection piece of technology I have ever owned. For context, my use is casual non-pro reading email, checking out Youtube, reading my favorite websites, and playing games. All of these are better than on a PC, Mac, or Ipod Touch, all of which I have experienced and own. Being a guy in his 50's, I like the ability to read with finger swipes, and adjust the font size to suit my eyes. I like the Flipboard app organization of articles I read. I like the expanding selection of strategy games like Ticket to Ride, Civ, and Knizia's games. I find I prefer using this for email over my Mac, because of speed. I like saving pdf files in a \"bookcase.\" I like Skyping, although my Mac is better at keeping my mug in the shot. I like showing my pix on it's big screen. The battery really does last 10 hours.\nSince getting this, my usage split has gone to about ~20% Mac Book Air, ~80% iPad.\n\nNow, if I could just figure out iMovie to edit my videos..."}

This is not a laptop/netbook or a desktop.\n\nReview for: iPad 2, 32gb 3G White with smart cover.\n\nGood:\n- IOS is the only stable tablet OS available right now in my opinion, yes android may be able to multi-task better but 99% of users will not know the difference. As for stability IOS (Apple) is miles ahead of Google.\n- Tons of tablet optimized applications, I have around 20 that I use regularly and never had a problem with any of them.\n- Zinio iPad application, if you are a Zinio subscriber the iPad is the best way to read your magazines. Much much faster than using even a desktop and also much more pleasant to read and use.\n- Can play pretty much any kind of video (including avi, mkv and others)if you install AVPlayerHD and output via HDMI. No stutter like on current batch of honeycomb tablets, at least in 720p which I use...\n- Great keyboard (virtual).\n- Battery we get around 11 hours on a charge with wifi on.\n- Stanby is even better you can most likely leave the tab unplugged and come back a week later to use it. If android phones are anything to go by android tablets probably don't have anywhere near the same standby performance. (can't remember the number of times I forget to plug my android phone at night and wake up with it dead, while my wife never plugs her iPhone and )\n\nCould have been better:\n- Flash support would have been good but I can live without it and quite frankly I just wish flash would go away from the web. Its not secure, is a resource hog and basically not very good technology in my opinion.\n- An sd card slot for expanding memory or keeping your music/movie collection on. So far I did not see a need for this but could be something I miss in the future.\n\nI don't like (in general for all Apple IOS devices):\n- Can only sync to one computer and the iTunes on that computer. What if you have more than one computer ? or quite simply want to load something at work and you are synced with a computer at home ? Your only choice is the cloud and even then you are limited with what you can put on the iPad.\n\nSummary very much like the iPad 2 and just ordered a second one as my wife has taken ownership of the current one. She uses it for work now and pretty much never touches her laptop... She is a university teacher, psychologist and researcher. The iPad is perfect for most of her needs from reading research documents to taking notes and light document writing."}

I think it sucks that if you don't use that purchased amount in 30 days you lose it. Damn!!Why can't I keep it until I use it up? That prompted me to purchase the Wifi version only (Either it is pay as you go or it is not) with Apple IT IS NOT.

It's rapidly becoming a replacement for my laptop (I'm typing on it right now).\n\nThere are still things that I have to connect it to the laptop for that should really be able to be done via wifi - iTunes syncing, batch uploading PDFs, syncing photos to and from the iPhoto library. These are not necessarily downsides, just things that are keeping me from using it separately from the computer.\n\nIt should really be able to update the podcasts I'm subscribed to automatically via wifi - it shouldn't require reconnecting to iTunes.\n\nThe virtually seamless integration it has with the Apple TV is proof to me that it should be capable of doing these things.\n\nThe battery life is pretty impressive. The biggest issues I have with its power relate to charging. It comes with a special 10W power adapter which allows you to charge the iPad in a relatively reasonable timeframe, but charging it via the computer's USB port is as easily measured in days as hours.\n\nThe charger looks exactly like the ones that come with the iPhone and iPod, and it will charge slowly with those, but the iPad's 10W adapter will overcharge the batteries in the iPad's smaller cousins, seriously diminishing their life. Again, not really a limitation on the iPad, but something for users to be aware of... I've labeled mine \"iPad only\" just to be absolutely sure I don't hurt my other equipment.\n\nThe front facing camera is pretty low quality. As a camera intended to be used for video chat, thats ok.\nThe rear facing camera is pretty low quality.  As a camera intended to be used for actually taking pictures, it's pretty inexcusable.\nThis is where they lost the star in my rating - I can get around the other deficiencies with iOS apps and by connecting to the computer, and just by being careful, but there's no overcoming a built-in hardware limitation like this."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Okay, I have had this for 3 weeks now and I think I have seen enough of it to know it.\n\nThis is my first Apple product, and let me start by saying YUCK! I have now started calling it crApple. All they do it market this product as if it is the best thing in the world, but it is definitely not.\n\nSo why 3 stars.\n\nPros:\nYes there is some good stuff, but I do not know how unique it is to Apple. Size, weight and battery life is super. You can use it the whole day, and angry birds is seriously addictive. It remembers each network and its settings so that I do not have to manually change proxy settings everytime I move from office to another place.\n\nCons:\nEveryone has said it but I'll say it again: No flash = No point! It is so annoying that you have to keep going from one applet to another to do things that you can normally do on a browser. Seriously, if you tube just decided to use flash and to remove their App I think Apple would go bankrupt.\n\nEditing stuff is impossible or as difficult as doing it on your phone, with the exception of a larger keyboard. Speaking of the keyboard I cannot for the life of me understand why apple cannot put arrow keys on it! So annoying! Yes there is a magnifier which allows you to scroll the cursor but how tedious it is!\n\nA lot of the other stuff has been mentioned in other reviews but these were teh maain points for me.\n\nAlso - a note for people considering a laptop or this - buy a laptop. This is the 3rd thing you need.\n\nThis is really ideal for someone who has a large heavy laptop which stays in one place and needs a lighter device to carry around for just brisk surfing, checking mail, watching some youtube and playing games (ie a bigger version of an iPhone).\n\nHowever, if I knew what I know now I would never have bought this thing. I would wait until google improves Android or microsoft comes up with some hardware that will kick Apple of its perch, because there is nothing like a normal windows operating system. I need flash, I need to be able to open, edit and  attach my edited files to gmail through a browser. I need flash (yes I said it again). I also want to be able to download whatever software I like and run it, without it having to be a mobile App.\n\nI think what has happened is that I made the mistake of thinking that the bigger screen meant that this was a real computer, rather than just another mobile device with all its limitation. So don;t buy this if you think you are getting a real computer. It is just a bigger version of a phone, and if it is not the 3G version it is just a rich mans toy."}

Apparently, apple products are not expandable as I thought. (I used an android operating system from verizon). So she is stuck with pictures in her sd card.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I already own a 2nd and 4th generation itouch so I was already familiar with how it worked.  My biggest reason for wanting an iPad 2 was I found the screen of the touch too small to surf the web or read a book, I wanted GPS (have to get the 3G model for that), camera (we use FaceTime a lot keeping in touch with family) and 3G for internet access for when we travel and are at places with no wifi.  I spend many hours at various sporting practices each week and for the past two years, the touch has kept me entertained (I actually looked forward to practice since it gave me at least two hours to sit and catch up on everything).\n\nThe iPad has taken it to a whole new level.  I have more reading material than I can read (books, magazines, email, etc.).  I love Netflix and HBO GO and I use it to stargaze at night (it can control my telescope through an app).  The entire family likes it so much that It's made the touches obsolete.  My husband who never liked the touch keeps taking my iPad.  The best part for me is that I am no longer chained to the computer.  I can read the news and check my calendar at the kitchen table or the over stuffed chair while having me coffee.  The only thing I've been using the laptop for is syncing.\n\nMy complaints are that I can no longer use my computer to charge the iPad (the car charger is also obsolete for the iPad.  I had to but a new one).  I also purchased two extra long USB cables and an extra charging brick as the cords that come with it are too short to charge and sit comfortably on the couch.  I also found that I can no longer use my Altec Lansing speaker dock to play music so that's something else I'll want to replace eventually.\n\nI purchased 1GB of data from Verizon for $20 for the month to see how far it would go.  I've been pleasantly surprised.  I may run out of time to use it before I run out of data.  Granted we have wifi at home and gymnastics but baseball, the grandparents, car and the doctor's office do not.  I thought streaming Netflix and HBO GO would use all of it up but it hasn't."}

I did have a few instances where once you turned off the cellular modem you could not get reconnected without turning it back on and rebooting. However, that has not been an issue for the last several weeks and the modem gets turned on and off several times a day. Either i have been lucky or they fixed the glitch. There is no help manual to accompany the Ipad. I located one through Apple's support site and downloaded the .pdf to the Ipad.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The biggest change in our lives so far with the arrival of our iPad 2 is now that we have three of them, no one is without an ipad 24/7.  You wouldn't think this would be a big deal but it is.  It has eliminated all discord here plus the place is quiet as a tomb most of the time as each person is curled up with his own ipad. We are a husband and wife in our 60s plus my husband's mother who is 100 years old. She is curled up with the iPad almost all day long as her ability to do anything active has all but vanished. She goes easily  from reading a Danielle Steele ebook to watching a Prince William and Kate lifetime movie.\n\nThe above is both versions of the iPad's biggest virtue: ANYONE OF ANY AGE CAN USE IT.  Both my husband and I are techie types so we are quite expert on computers.  Friends in our age range usually are not.  My advice to every one of them is \"buy an ipad.\"  It puts those with low tech abilities on an even playing field because they do everything with their fingers and visually.  It is the supreme compliment to say about either iPad, \"any idiot can use it.\"\n\nRight now you can't buy an iPad 1.  We were going to buy a third one of those on sale but they sold out so fast that we had to get the iPad 2 as our third one.  My husband is the one who appreciates subtle refinements in electronics.  He has been in seventh heaven since it arrived.  Truthfully, my mother in law and I, as long as we can get on it and read our books, watch our movies, assemble recipes in our app cookbook, and so forth and so on, are happy as can be and both iPad versions do that extremely well.  My husband is the one who waxes rhapsodically over lighter weight, better LED screen, improved battery life, and so forth.  Like most reviewers of iPad 2 he concludes that it is a beautiful evolution but not a revolution from the first iPad.\n\nFor those of you with extended families elsewhere, there are other new features which could be huge features for you.  The ability now to visit with family members by video with your ipad 2 are completely built in.  It has two way cameras. I would like to talk our other family members in California into getting one for the benefit of my mother-in-law, who could have excellent \"visits\" by iPad with all of them.\n\nAlso if you want to stream what is on your ipad directly to your HDTV and projectors, that too is now built in. We don't have such a tv because we like watching directly on the iPad itself with earphones.\n\nThere is also the ability to not only take your own videos but to edit them online. Plus the ability to locate your ipad if it is lost and to wipe its contents remotely.\n\nThese above new features are opening up a lot of possibilities for educators as well.  Apple maintains an entire subsection on its website to helping educators use the new features to iPad 2 to best advantage.  Essentially, it wants to enable them to use the iPad 2 to put its content onto a screen immediately in front of their students with the teacher controlling the whole thing with his or her fingers.  Go over to Apple to check this all out as it is incredible.\n\nI absolutely love the camera on the iPad 2.  There was no camera on the iPad 1.  Much as I have always loved my iPhone's camera, and much as I complained about who would want to use a camera the size of the iPad 2, I admit I underestimated it.  It is just a fabulous camera and with just pointing and shooting you take pictures that look as if a professional had taken them.\n\nI also researched this cover that apple was pushing real hard.  It looks great but i discovered the users were not happy with it.  Turns out they have to clean their screens every time they use it because it leaves three big marks on the glass every time.  They also said it was unstable as a stand and one guy smashed his ipad on the floor as a result, shattering it.  Apple is not very good at these accessory devices.  So we ordered the zoogue ipad 2 case and are very happy with it. We have zoogues on our other two ipads as well and are totally happy with them.  Just put the word zoogue into search engines to find it."}

If staying online is that important AND you don't mind carrying it around (it's not heavy, but it's bulky), then you could consider this gadget. It's like a sports car, it's nice to have, but it's not a necessity. What would be nice is something between the iPad 2 and the iPhone / iPad Touch sized iPad mini, that would be half the screen size of the iPad 2.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Although advertised as superior and significantly more updated than the original iPad, the iPad 2 is not all that different than its recent ancestor. A categorical comparison quickly reveals that the quick release and updates were unnecessary in such a short amount of time. For new buyers, by all means get the iPad 2 and the updated features. However, for those owners of an original iPad, do not waste $500 buying this \"new and improved\" product, because the $600 original you are holding in your hands right now is essentially the same.\n\nFor starters, the dimensions for both products are the same, with the exception of the width. The iPad 2 is 0.16 inches thinner than the original, resulting in a 0.15-pound decrease in weight. Both devices have the same amount of storage, however the iPad 2 has double the amount of RAM memory performance, which leads to faster download times and less of the \"checkerboard effect.\"  Both devices include models with Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi + 3G and Bluetooth capabilities. The displays are the same size and both feature the fingerprint resistant oleophobic coating. The processor on the iPad 2 features the Dual-Core A5 chip, whereas the original only has the A5 chip, but upon consistent use, the speed appears to be about the same. The original iPad uses the Mac iOS 4.2.1 operating system, which is just a step down from the iPad 2's iOS 4.3 operating system, and few differences are noted, and nearly none are experienced.\n\nThe one feature that Apple is heavily marketing is the user's ability to FaceTime another iPad 2 user. Although this is cool, is it really worth spending an extra $500 if you already own an iPad? Why not just use your iPhone? Or Skype? Apple is also talking up the iPad 2's 10-hour battery life. They must be hoping no one does their research, because the original iPad has the exact same battery life! The iPad 2 also features a new, smart cover. What's really \"smart\" about an electronic device cover, I'm not entirely sure. I own an original iPad black leather cover and I think it's pretty smart too.\n\nIf you are reading this review and do not own an iPad at all, by all means go for the new iPad 2. It's fast, skinny and features a camera and FaceTime abilities. However, if you already are the proud owner of an original iPad, do not waste your money. If it only took Apple one measly year to release an iPad 2, it probably won't take much longer to release an iPad 3 or 4. By that time, maybe the updates will actually be worth burning a hole in your wallet. For now, my suggestion is save your money, cherish your original iPad, and wait until an \"upgraded\" product comes along that actually presents some significant improvements."}

I was close, oh so close to hitting the \"buy\" button then decided to shop around a wee-bit given the expense of the tablet.  Within a day or two the announcements concerning a few of Apple's hottest products .. iPad 2 & iPhone, we all know what those concerns are hit the media circuits.  I can't speak for you but, I most certainly don't want my every waking moment tracked - especially as deviously as Apple has set out to do. Apple didn't ask permission, didn't bother putting it in the \"fine\" print and when caught red-handed wouldn't even address. I have a million questions of my own i.e., whose idea was this, is Apple being paid by \"?\", is he government involved - what? It's out of control .. Everthing! I like my toys as much as the next guy but will trash them if this I Spy chit continues.  Needless to say I am not in the market for an iPad in the near furture.  My opinion, not a review granted - had I already purchased the iPad it would have been longer, louder and most likely censored!"}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Apple markets this as the ultimate portable computer product, but it has serious shortcomings similar to the iPhone that I wasn't aware of as I don't own one.  If you have no interest in external files or photos, then this may not be important to you.  I waited a month for mine to be delivered, and after a week, I can say I'm keenly disappointed for specific reasons of Apple's own making.\n\nYou can't transfer ANY file to it, you can only SYNC all files from one designated computer, i.e. tethered.\n\nDespite reading enormous reviews & comments about the original, as well as the 2, I never got the impression from anyone that this was the case.  There were a few rumblings about \"file handling\" and workarounds for it [\"everything's going to the cloud anyway\" \"just use dropbox\"] - but nothing that says what an incredible restriction it is for anyone using photos/movies at all.  Their only official solution is that you buy a $40 dongle that then will allow SD card content [no CF cards, which I have]  to be transferred directly.  But the worst part is that even if you were to transfer anything to it, it all gets dumped at the bottom of  \"saved photos\" without any file separation, and no ability to separate or make collections of them after transfer either.\n\nUnlike my iPods, you can NEVER transfer any existing file to another, or create a new one.  Only with Sync.  Apparently they want you to work \"with the app\" to do whatever you want to do.  So the only way you could store photos is randomly, unless you want to sync all file/photos from your one mothership computer.  The only semi-solution is to email yourself whatever you want, then download the photos/files...which again will only be dumped in the \"saved photo\" generic file.  You can imagine the limitations with original file sizes.\n\nAnother key element to me is the lack of any tabbed browsing, whether in Safari or the special Bing app for the iPad [superior to Safari for most things].  So to actually write an email, while constantly switching between single browser pages etc. I'd find ridiculously cumbersome, not to mention that you can't resize ANY windows/apps at all.  You can only resize font/content within a given page.\n\nWhich brings me to the keyboard, or lack thereof.  I had no idea that the numeric/symbol part of the keyboard is ALWAYS separate from the alpha part, meaning that if you're ever entering alpha/numeric content, i.e. passwords, airline record #'s etc. you have to hit one key to show the number part, hit the number/symbol, then hit another key to reveal the alpha part again, and back and forth endlessly.  In addition, because there's no real tactile feel for the keys, and because the entry points are different for every program [where the browser bar is vs input for youtube etc] you're staring at the keyboard to make sure your fingers are in the right place, then having to look back up and find where it's going, then back down etc., which not only slows the process, but can give you a headache from your neck bobbing up & down, as well as the different light/contrast levels for the keyboard vs the rest of the screen.\n\nYes - I know that you can get a separate bluetooth keyboard, and that would solve some of it - but it also defeats some of the advantage of the form factor if you have to haul the 2 around everywhere you go.\n\nThis doesn't even address any particular program you may want to work on - just the physical/OS realities of trying to work with it at all.\n\nYes - scrolling through photos is very fast, and can be easily manipulated with your fingers.  Yes there are some very inventive apps out there that take advantage of finger-abilities, but what the finger giveth, it also taketh away when it comes to anything that requires content creation or precision.  I never expected it to do something like Photoshop, but to be this crippled wasn't in the cards either.\n\nThis should be marketed to generic users not comfortable with computers, and iPhone users who are used to--and don't want anything more than what their iPhone will already do.  The geeks that have championed it should be dismissed for misleading everyone, as they will always find workarounds, and have multiple devices anyway [macbook air/pro/imac etc].  They could just as easily make an Android phone/tablet work for them.\n\nThe strength of Apple is supposed to be it's user-friendliness, flexibility and support...with their advertising just teasing out a few of the myriad possibilities of the device.  In the iPad's case, I feel they did the opposite:  they oversold it's abilities, touting dual-core ships, 9x better graphics etc., when in fact none of that really matters at the only pace the interface allows.  [I got my mom a refurb original iPad, the first computer she can work - and there's little difference in most app performance]\n\nAt the direction of my local Genius Bar & Store Manager, I went in search of an app that could help with photo file/transfer, but I queried one of the best reviewed, \"PhotoSync\" to be sure they responded:\n\n\"PhotoSync can only transfer photos to the save photos folder. This restriction is made by Apple unfortunately. Third party developers are not allowed to create albums in the camera roll, save photos in other locations than the saved photos folder, or to delete photo from the camera roll.  All these features Apple reserves completely for itself.  We hope that this will change one day in a newer iOS version but at this point it is the only thing we can offer (though we would like to offer more).\"\n\nThat may be plenty for most others, but it's not for me.  I went back to see if I skipped parts of reviews that mentioned this, and no - i didn't.  Here's from Mossberg from WSJ...who runs down all the drawbacks, including poor-quality cameras etc., then says:\n\n\"there are two big omissions, one old and one new. The old one is that, like Apple's prior phones and tablets, the shiny new iPad 2 still won't play Adobe's Flash video in its built-in Web browser. This is a deliberate decision by Apple, and puts its devices at a disadvantage for some users when compared with Android tablets, which can play Flash, or say they will soon, albeit not always well.\n\nThe other omission has to do with cellular data. The iPad 2 can't use, or be upgraded to use, the new, faster 4G cellular-data networks being rolled out.\"\n\nNO mention of any of the aspects that are important to me, and I would think to a substantial number of people...even if we aren't a majority.\n\nI want it to be the Next Big Thing - the one that replaces laptops with a smaller, more flexible form factor that's also inspiring to use.\n\nI'm just left with the deflated feeling that I've been had, and mostly because of some very dumb and ridiculous failures in their OS that don't have to be that way...just sticking a finger in my eye as a dedicated Mac user.\n\n**Update** I got the 11\" Macbook Air and am very happy with it - although it is a lot more computer power than I needed in pure portable terms -  it isn't substantially bigger than the iPad [especially with keyboard] for those of you that can afford it."}

It felt heavy for me to hold with one hand as an e-book reader(which was my primary motivation). After using the iPhone4(and a very happy user, I must say) with retina display, I found the display not very crisp and somewhat underwhelming.\n\nSome of the iphone apps have different look and feel on the iPad2, gmail for instance. Overall, I was satisfied, till yesterday.\n\nIt fell from 2 feet from my son's hand on to the concrete garage floor, and the glass shattered. the Ipad2 works fine, it has a cracked screen. The touch functionality works, even over the cracked screen(an engineering marvel!)\n\nI called apple support today, and they want $269 to replace the screen, that is more than 50 percent of the product.

For instance, you are unable to watch showtimes on IMDB because of its weakness to install flash player. I don't like a company with business purposes enforce me to use just something particular even if its products are so attractive. Also, its transferring data, as a wifi device, is entirely disappointing since such products are new and their technologies haven't been improved as good as you might expect.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "People need to be aware that the reviews you see for the iPad often reflect the old Mac/PC platform wars with some people making comments who simply don't like iPads from a distance, without actually owning one, because they see it as part of the deplorable Apple mania they find so distasteful.  They're entitled to their opinion, of course, but it is unfortunate they skew the evaluation of this product without the deep acquaintance one needs in order to give it an insightful evaluation.\n\nI have taught computer science at the college level for 26 years and have had computers with all kinds of operating systems. I don't own Apple stock and have never known anyone who works at Apple. I therefore have no connection to Apple.\n\nI have had my iPad for about a month and read a fair number of reviews before I purchased, spent some time using one at the store, and thought about what I might use one for, in contrast to my laptop with which I am well satisfied. People too often think of computers in terms of hardware, the specs and looks, instead of the software and the functionality.  You should ask yourself, \"What will I use this for that solves a problem I would like to have solved?\"  Software is always more important than hardware, even though it is the hardware that makes an impression.\n\nThe iPad is not a laptop and is not principally a production computer, that is, a computer on which you are going to develop web pages, do serious graphics editing, or write a book.  You could use your new Taurus to tow a trailer, but that is not what it is designed to do well. These things can increasingly be done on an iPad, but I don't believe they will ever be what it is best at.  It is a portable media machine with an inviting touch interface that requires a somewhat different set of skills, which take a modest amount of time to learn.  Surfing the web, checking email, watching movies, playing games, looking at new cars, reading the Economist magazine, all work better on an iPad than a laptop.  It does these things very well indeed. There are now 80,000 apps for a wide variety of activities--given its design intent.  The apps are either free or reasonably priced, so you can get a bunch from the \"app store\" for little investment. As with Amazon, you can see what other people think of an app before getting one.\n\nThis would be a splendid acquisition for small children, for teens deep into social networking, for an adult wanting to drop into the love seat for a quick look at what is happening in the world, for a senior citizen who wants a simple, inviting system with few hassles, to stay in touch with grandchildren.  The iPad is not a light laptop; it is instead a different way to use computing to do a wide variety of consumption and communication--not principally production.\n\nIn my experience, its wi-fi is adroit from one environment to another.  It \"knows\" where it is geographically, scans its environment for wi-fi, and accesses wi-fi seamlessly.  At this point in time, we should expect no less.  I cannot address the 3G communications since I have a wi-fi only (I am not convinced of the value of the 3G and I can use my phone as a hotspot).  I have never had it crash, though I have had to back myself out of apps that seemed to have no logical next step.  This was the result either of my ignorance or the fact that there is less of a standard user interface from app to app than there is in classical GUIs such as OS X and Windows.\n\nFor the laptop lugging road-warrior, it should be noted, this is not going to be a full replacement.  I now take my laptop and my iPad when I go into the college.  But much of the time there, I use my iPad because it is so light, convenient and useable. I use it to teach my classes and often reference traditional texts from the iPad instead of lugging them along to class. I develop my own web pages on my 27\" desktop which is the right environment for such development; I wouldn't expect to do that on an iPad.  In education (and evidently in medicine), it is proving to be a real boon.  The enterprise situations where portable information access and transmission are critical will find this a compelling solution.  The heavy Photoshop user or music track editor will still need a conventional computer, either laptop or desktop.\n\nI purchased the 64GB version, which may be more storage than I need. But since it will drive my 50\" screen downstairs I figured I would begin to load lots of pictures and favored music, so it may prove a wise choice in the long run.  It can swallow up entire evenings with the music-augmented slide shows it can do. In fact, you may begin to wonder if you need cable TV.  Conventional content providers should be worried about the iPad since it provides yet another way for the user to determine viewing experience. But if you are still drawn to cable, it makes a fine remote control.\n\nBefore people evaluate this new kind of computing, they need to spend a month or so with it to identify what it does well and what would be better left to other kinds of computing solutions. I fear some of the evaluations here (both glowing and critical) are not well informed and so do not serve the readers well.  So read these reviews with a critical eye.\n\nOctober 18 2011 Update:\n\nI continue to find my iPad remarkably productive and productive in ways I would not have anticipated. It does indeed redefine how we can use computing so that it does the work we want to do with minimal impediments.  I now leave my laptop at school and take my iPad back and forth since 80 or 90% of the time the iPad does all I need to do.  I use it 3 or 4 hours a day.\n\nI just ordered my wife an 11\" MacBook Air with the larger RAM and storage, which might seem to contradict what I said in my review.  I don't believe it does for the following reasons. She needs to do serious editing of Word documents for the volunteer work she does for the college and still wants the joys of a 2-pound piece of elegant hardware. She is an excellent typist and likes the feel of the Air's keyboard. A keyboard can be added to an iPad, but it's a kludgy add-on that compromises the point of the iPad: an ultra-light slim, touch-interface device that does most of what traditional computing does without the impediments of mouse and keyboard and weight.  The 11\" Air is a gem of engineering with many of the advantages of the iPad but it is more capable of the production I spoke of in my review since it is a full OS X Lion machine--so it is fully capable of running traditional production software such as Word or Photoshop or, for that matter, Windows.\n\nThe Air and the iPad illustrate the difference between a consumption device (iPad) and a production device (Air).  Much of what is appealing in the iPad can be had in the Air, but at the cost of an additional several hundred dollars. It's not the solution I want since I don't want the keyboard getting in the way when I want to curl up with a consumption device in my favorite love seat or use it to assist my teaching in class.  My wife prefers the Air since email and other typing-intensive production activities are so important to her. In a word, the iPad is distilled essence of computationally assisted consumption.\n\nI guess we will give the phrase \"mixed marriage\" new meaning!"}

I tried the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MOTOROLA-XOOM-Android-Tablet-Wi-Fi/dp/B0045FM6SU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MOTOROLA XOOM Android Tablet (Wi-Fi)</a>&nbsp;and was happy enough until I tried this iPad 2.  I love this updated version!  The only issue I had was trying to decide which version to get since there are many options.\n\nStorage capacity can be 16 GB, 32 GB or 64 GB.  I would recommend at least the 32 GB since you cannot expand the storage and although apps do not take up much space, I was amazed at the amount of stuff I loaded onto my iPad (photos, movies, music, documents, etc.).  Trying to save some money, I wondered if I should get wi-fi only or the wi-fi/3G combination and with which service provider, AT&T or Verizon? Every iPad has wireless technology built in and automatically finds wi-fi networks easily but if you want to use it while traveling, the great outdoors or rural areas, wi-fi is not always an option.  If you have an iPhone 4, you can use it as a personal wi-fi hotspot for your iPad but your iPhone carrier might charge extra when this option is used.  Also, GPS is on the 3G models only, wi-fi provides an approximate location and this could be an issue if you love using Four Square or other GPS based applications.  More importantly, the wi-fi only model cuts your battery time down (~8 hours).  If you do choose wi-fi + 3G, I would check with AT&T or Verizon networks for pricing before deciding.  Both seem to provide reasonable costs for domestic usage but international usage is outrageous.  The previous iPad allowed any carrier to be used overseas (which is a bargain) but I'm not sure if AT&T and Verizon models allow for the same thing.\n\nThis new version is lighter, faster, slimmer and has slightly longer battery life at 10 hours.  I love the brilliant LED backlit display on the 9.7 inch screen.  I'm still not a fan of Pages (iWork) but it is possible to get Word documents on your iPad through iTunes.  There is no official Microsoft version but being able to download Word documents from my pc to the iPad and work on them makes a huge difference for me. I really love the technological improvements that allows this iPad to know your every move and be more responsive.  No matter how you rotate this iPad, the display self adjusts - even if you place it upside down!  It makes playing games like Critter Ball that much more fun to play and allows viewing movies or reading a book in any position.  Need I comment about Apple apps?  They beat the Android and every other market out there on this score and help make Apple products first choice.\n\nFor me, The only thing that prevents this tablet from being perfect is a better camera and the lack of Mozilla (I know this will never happen).  I have tried a lot of tablets and prefer this one over all others.  Yes, it is expensive but I consider it a good investment since it allows me to complete tasks on-the-go and help pass the time while waiting.  I think having this iPad along with an iPhone (or any smartphone) is the best combination.  Smartphones can provide information from the web but their small screen size can make viewing difficult and this iPad allows for a perfect union."}

It's a beautiful product, as with all other Apple products I have purcThe hased however.....the Wi-Fi capability is not so good. It works for a while and then stops working. I called Apple. They had me delete the password for my network and then put the password back in. It worked fine for a while...just as it did when I first installed it. But only for a while. I don't get it. I have a relatively new Belkin 2 wireless network on Cable and have been using it for several years. I have two laptop computers, two printers, and an iPod touch with Wi Fi. They all work just fine. I can work all day, every day on any of these devices from anywhere in my house or in my yard.\n\nBut not with the iPAD 2.\n\nwith the iPad 2 it works for a while and then stops working. Very frustrating.\n\nThis is not only a review but a request for help if anyone knows what's going on.\n\nBELOW IS A FOLLOW-UP ON MY IPAD2:\n\nBTW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ ALL OF THIS, HERE IS A QUICK SUMMARY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS:\n\n1. It never worked properly on my home network or other networks I tried at Starbucks, shopping centers, etc.\n2. It was too big and heavy.\n3. To read a book on it was a problems because it was heavy and just touching a little part of the screen caused pages to flip by very fast which meant I had to search for where I was about every few minutes.\n4. Even though I bought a 2 years warranty, sent it in for repair and eventually got a new/used one from Apple it still never solved any of the problems.\n5. Apple never would do anything substantive for me...like give me my money back or give me an Apple credit. So in the end I had to sell it for what I could get - $400, which meant I lost $250+plus the accessories, apps, the Warranty etc. I had spent.\n\nI am NOT an Apple basher and I enjoy my iPods (3) we have in our family. However, I'll never buy Apple again because of their \"return\" \"credit\" etc. policy. They have really made me unhappy with this experience and I did everything I could to work with them.\n\nI got an iPad2 with 32Gig memory ($599) + a \"magic cover\" ($60) from Loretta for my birthday this year. The \"magic cover\" is magnetic. It covers and protects the screen of the iPad2 when you're not using it and turns the machine on and off by putting the cover on and off. I also bought an $80 2-year warranty service. So all in all, without tax and shipping, we spent about $720 for the thing. The short story is the iPad2 didn't work for me. It wouldn't stay connected to our network. Every time I wanted to use it I had to go through the network settup process all over again. Apple Customer Service was no help. After hours with them I sent it in for \"repair.\" I got it back and it worked exactly the same, which is to say, it didn't work exactly as it didn't work before I sent it in. I kept asking for my money back or a credit but they kept refusing. Finally I sent it to them and they sent me a \"new\" (i.e. new to ME) unit. That's right, they did NOT say they would give me a new iPad2. They said they would give me a \"refurbished\" unit. I thought this was crappy since I'd only owned the thing for a month and had spent most of that time on the phone with their service department. Anyway, I got a \"new\" unit and it worked the same...i.e. it didn't work. Again, they refused to give me my money or a credit. So I finally just sold it. I got $400 for it so we lost about $350 (with shipping and tax).\nBesides not hooking up to our network, it was also big and heavy and no fun to sit and read books or browse the web or do any of the things I wanted it for. Reading a book, for example was a hassle. You had to hold this big heavy thing by the very edge of the \"frame\" because if you touched the screen anywhere it would flip through pages FAST and I spent most of my time trying to find where I left off. A real pain.\nApart from all of that, the iPad2 is beautiful, has a beautiful screen and presents a beautiful, rich, colorful picture of whatever you're viewing. But not that much better than my Dell laptop.\nBy the way, I KNOW our network works. It's the most recent Belkin WAP2 system and it works flawlessly with both of our Dell laptops, our DELL wireless color printer and our Brother wireless Laser Printer. I also had an Apple iPod Touch which worked perfectly using our same Wireless network. So it HAD to be something in the iPad2 that just didn't work. Anyway, I don't think I'll buy anything more from Apple, mainly because that even when something doesn't work right out of the box they won't give your money back or even give you a credit.\nWhat I DID buy and am very happy with, is an Amazon Kindle Latest Generation Wi Fi for $140 + $60 for a leather cover with built in reading light which actually works.\nThe networking on the Kindle works great...just like our Dell Laptops and our printers.\nFor more money, you can get a Kindle with not only Wi Fi but also 3G, so it will work using your phone network as well as your home network. We didn't need that feature though.\nThe Kindle is great for reading books, magazines, newspapers, etc. You can get thousands of free books, but current books, or subscriptions to periodicals will cost you. If I was still traveling I'd get the 3G and subscribe to the NY Times but I can't read all of the news I want to (which isn't much) on my computer.\nWhat I do like, is reading books on the Kindle. You can set up your machine with the font, font size, number of words per line, etc. etc. so that everything you read is the same in terms of those features.\nYou can shop for books at Amazon from your computer or from your Kindle using the Wi Fi or 3G system.\nIt's black and white, but that's OK with me.\nIt's small and light weight and very easy to use.\nThe leather cover with built in light is a really nice feature. The light works off of the Kindle battery, which lasts about a month and charges up in less than an hour.\nReading in bed, the light shines only on the Kindle page so it doesn't bother anyone else in bed with you.\nI've got about 100 books on my Kindle right now. All of them I got free from either Amazon or Gutenberg. When you \"buy\" from Gutenberg or some other free source you just download the file (in Kindle format) and email it to a special email address you get which is then on Amazon.\nAnytime you turn on your Kindle it automatically downloads whatever you've bought from Amazon or sent to Amazon from where you bought it.\nIt also does audio books and works the same way with those. However, you have to plug in earphones of course, to listen.\nIt holds 3500 books, so I've got plenty of room left.\nAnyway, if you're interested in an \"eReader\" I can recommend the Kindle over the iPad2.\nIf you're interested in something with which to browse the web, I say, stick to a laptop.\nI know Apple makes some beautiful products, but I think the iPad2 is a flop for what I wanted to use it for.\nI think it's great for playing games on or looking at photos or maybe even watching a movie (after you've downloaded it) but I wouldn't want to try to watch a movie using \"streaming\" because of the networking issue."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "My primary reason to buy an iPad was both work and home use. At work I wanted to stop printing the powerpoint decks and reports to read, and just read them on an iPad in meetings/on the go. For home I was tired of not being able to get to all my magazines and never having them on me when I wanted to read them. I also wanted to watch some TV/movies in bed/around the home so that I did not have to switch on the big living room TV. The iPad 2 has been a perfect solution for all these and more. I'm kicking myself that I went with the lowest 16GB version as I find myself downloading more content and apps everyday! It's not a laptop/desktop replacement either at home or work, but it's a great media consumption device and more.\n\nI already used my iPhone 4 constantly due to the multitude of apps and games available for it. Fewer apps are available for iPad but it's still thousands, and I have already downloaded 200+ to try, most of them free.\n\nThe hardware itself is very slick. Very light so you can hold it in one hand, especially if you use a cover - otherwise it tends to be slippery. But it's not so much about the hardware, which other reviews have detailed anyway. It's all about being able to do what you want to do with a device. With the best technology the device itself should disappear and allow you to create, read, connect - whatever it is you want to do. That's what iPad 2 is doing for me, like a netbook never could. Using it is so intuitive and seamless, that despite having the iPhone 4, I am amazed with how much more I can do to be productive. I regret not buying it sooner!\n\nLike the previous devices Apple has created the genius is in the apps available for it. The PressReader apps allows me to read newspapers and magazines from all over the world. I can now read some favorite magazines that were so difficult to get in the print version and newspapers too. Apps like the Flipboard and Zite make magazine content come alive. Favorite magazines like Bloomberg Businessweek and Wired are available free as iPad versions to print subscribers. Also, all news magazines are now featuring interactive content, so I'm reading the news article and looking at static images, and then just as easily click on a video to watch it. The Daily is a good interactive made for newspaper but I'm looking for even better interactive journalism!\n\n\"The Civil War\" shows us what history books of future should look like with its interactive content and a daily log of events as they happened 150 years ago. Netflix streams nicely and I can watch the content I want to that bore my family to tears - like documentaries. I also download all my PDF reading materials on it and can read and annotate and highlight. Powerpoints are so easy to read and I can scale the screen to look at the graphs better. iMovie is so simple to use, and I've already created several home movies with music and subtitles. GarageBand is great for novices like me, it has a multitude of instruments that I can play and even has smart versions to create music. With penultimate and UPad I've been trying to completely do away with paper notepads, but that's not the perfect solution yet.\n\nWith apps like Dropbox and Box you can drop your files into the cloud and access them from your iPad. Chatting over FaceTime or over Webex is simple, although it's entirely dependent on bandwidth. With other apps you can access your remote desktop and use every program on your computer or pull any file. I am using TeamViewer which is free for individuals to log into my home PC from work and check my files or run some programs remotely. It shows you your PC screen on your iPad and you drag your finger to move the mouse cursor and click. It's pretty seamless once you set it up, as simple as opening the app. I opened it one day from work to see my kid watching Youtube and surprised her at dinner when she told me she had been doing home work (ha!).\n\nAnother made for iPad app I use a lot is the Tivo Remote. When I turn it on it automatically shows the program I'm currently watching on the iPad screen with more details and upcoming episodes. I can use the remote buttons or explore like programs, set my season passes, etc. And when I'm not home I can use it to record programs remotely. Xfinity from Comcast also allows you to schedule and watch your onDemand content. HBO GO is simply a delight, I am thrilled to have all the HBO shows available to me anywhere I go!\n\nI have been reading much more since I got iPad 2. Especially blogs, magazines and newspapers. That alone makes it worth it for me. And it's SO much easier to stream content like TED Talks, Lectures from YouTube, movies from Crackle and Netflix. I would have never wanted to sit down with my heavy and hot laptop for such prolonged periods to watch this content. There are some fun games available too, and every day more apps get launched which make me wonder how did I manage without this before!\n\nFacetime has been fun too. There are Qik (from Skype) and Tango, and several other apps available that will let you do video chat but since Facetime is integrated with email, you can just click on a contact's name and choose to connect through FaceTime. I can not only check on my kid on video through this feature (all they need is an iPod Touch and wireless) but also connect with friends overseas for free. And I can click their pics while they're on the call with me. Again this feature is dependent on video quality but as a multi-tasking mom it's been great to be able to connect any time in video from work to home. My kid will be listening to music on her iPod Touch and my FaceTime call comes in - and we're off talking face to face. VLC Player has been a great app to watch .avi and other videos. I had slightly lower res version of a TV series in AVI format and the VLC player allowed me to watch it on iPad, I prefer that screen to my HP Pavilion 17 inch which has worse resolution and tends to get too hot in my lap anyway\n\nBattery life was a big surprise for me. Mine lasts 10-11 hours on the WiFi model with full usage. That is amazing, I never carry the charger as it goes 2 days without charging. Love it! None of my laptops can compare!\n\nThe frustrations I experienced with the iPad 2 was its inability to play Flash, which will not come any time soon due to Steve Job's dislike of that technology. However, a genius of an app called iSwifter has found a way to run flash on iPad 2 and I have been using it to watch video on websites that have flash content. However, it's still not as seamless as I would like it to be! The other is a more seamless way to store and organize photos and files. I can do this through apps but why not make this more seamless. If I have to delete photos there should be a select all feature to delete a whole folder.\n\nIf you're on the fence about buying an iPad 2 go ahead and make the leap, you won't regret it. If you already have an iPad then hold on for iPad 3 as this version gives you some enhancements (faster, improved graphics, thinner, cameras) but nothing that is so extraordinary that you can't wait another few months!"}

The maps app is very accurate.\n\nIn my experience the best apps for this tablet are those of magazines, or newspapers, etc. News and books in general look really good."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I bought an IPAD 2 64 gig 3g Verizon model the first week it came out. I bought it online. I received it 3 1/2 weeks later from china. It was amazing for the first 20 hours. The apps were so unbelievable. I have a touch, and it is so much better. On the second day, it started trying to shut down. The battery was at 80%. I tried shutting it off and could not. I called apple. I bought the extra care plan for 90 dollars so they are going to help me. Right? Wrong. The first representative we talked to had us restore it to the factory settings. It took 1 hour to download the 660 mg file. We then restored it to the factory settings. It started working perfectly. We were so happy. The problem was solved! I watched videos and played with it for hours. I ran the battery down and plugged it in overnight to charge. The next morning the problem was back in spades. It then started doing new things like flashing on and off. I went on the website and asked a specialist to call me again. She put me on hold. She was gone for a little while. When she came back, she said that I needed to mail it back to them to REPAIR it. I said What? I have the apple care plan and was told that you would send me a replacement. I have not even had this thing 2 days. She said that the other representative lied to me, and that she could not lie to me. I have 2 options. I can take it to the Apple Store (nearest one 165 miles away) or I can mail it and have it repaired and they will send the same one back to me. She made me an appointment at the store. I am driving the 165 miles to take it back. The second representative (a supervisor) told me that they would send me a replacement if I gave them a credit card and let them charge another 900 dollars for it. When they received the old one back, they would charge it back to me.\n\nI have had a kindle for years. The day I saw it on the Oprah show was the day I fell in love with it. I bought one the same day. The first kindle i received was great except the internet would not work. I called Amazon and they shipped me out a kindle the SAME DAY! I got it a couple of days later and loved it. It worked perfectly. I upgraded to a DX and have never had a problem.\n\nIf you want to see a video of what it is doing, you can go to you tube and watch it. My username is caulret. I love Amazon and their amazing customer service!\n\nEdited 4-16-11\nI took it back to the Apple store. The people at the Plano Apple store were awesome. They did not want to give me my money back, but we negotiated with them and they ended up putting it back on our credit card with some creative measures. A more timid person would have had to take an apple gift card. This was all they said that they could do at first, but I held my ground.  I might buy this product again at a local Best Buy when they come available. If I decide to do that, I will edit this review. This was my true experience, and I wanted to share it."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I love my new iPad2! But I was very disappointed with the included accessories. The USB cable is frustratingly short. The iPad seems to need more power than my USB ports provide, so it won't charge that way. Therefore I have to plug it into the wall, and the ~3ft cord isn't long enough to have the iPad on my desk or in hand while it's charging. I currently have my iPad sitting on the floor in my office so it can charge. Not a very useful location!\n\nThe USB outlet connector is also frustratingly designed. It has so much mass above and below the prongs that, when plugged into a power strip, it covers outlets on both sides of the one it's plugged into. It's nice that the prong set comes off (to make it interchangeable for sale in other countries or for travel, I assume), but a rotating prong would have been helpful. Other products I've bought have had that basic usability.\n\nOverall I gave this review 4 stars. I love the iPad itself, but I can't easily use it the way I want to without purchasing additional accessories, such as a longer USB cable."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "We are now the proud owners of two (2) iPad 2 tablets.  We have one white 64GB WiFi/AT&T 3G and one black 16GB WiFi.\n\nMy family all pooled together to buy my son his iPad 2 (after they saw how he was responding to my 3G version).  Unlike many children with autism, my son has never been very computer or technologically inclined.  His interests have always been with physical and tangible objects and interests (not a bad thing, at all)... but we strongly suspected that the iPad touchscreen would change all of that.\n\nThere are some remarkable apps for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) - some of which (fortunately) we don't need to use, since my son is very verbal.  That having been said - I have watched how the iPad is completely transforming the lives of his peers who are not very verbal.  Since this isn't a review of the apps, I won't write a whole book about the great apps - except to highlight three that perform really well on the iPad for my son:  1) the \"First Then\" schedule - you can use stock photos, photos you take, or grab them from Google images; 2) Stories2Learn where you can make your own social stories using photos you take; and \"Look in My Eyes\" a game that makes your child look squarely into the eyes of images of children (there is a secret number displayed) that needs to be entered on a next page to get \"prizes\".\n\nOkay - so now a review of the iPad itself...\n\nFor the 64GB wifi/3G model - I swore I would only use it for my son and myself... that I wouldn't get sucked into using it for work (since I am the one who paid for it... right?).  Okay, well that plan lasted all of 3 minutes.  I have all of the attachments now: the VGA connector (used it yesterday to put maps up on the wall during a meeting using our projector); the HDMI connector (which is genius - since it has a 2nd port to provide power using your own AC adapter - and I use this at home and at work to plug into the TVs/LCD displays); the USB and SD Card reader (which imports my photos from my Nikon DSLRs); and my sister bought me the bluetooth keyboard (which I thought would be superfluous - but since I AM actually using this for work ALL OF THE TIME - it comes in very handy).  All of the Apple attachments work great.  Yesterday, I received a cheap non-Apple 2100 mAmp car charger from Amazon - and it works GREAT.  Charges, and I'm not afraid of my iPad battery frying!\n\nSo, let me get to the two negatives - since that's why YOU are reading this review - right?  You want to figure out what is wrong with this thing... if anything.  The honest truth is that the cameras STINK!!!  Totally, and completely.  So, why give it a 5 star review, right?  The cameras WORK for the purpose that I wanted:  to use facetime to call my sister who lives overseas... and for that - it works passibly well.  Not in low light.  NEVER in low light.  So... I adjust.  Don't call Asia with the lights off!  Problem solved, solution found!  Trying to take photos with the front or back camera - also not great.  REALLY HORRIBLE in the low light conditions I just mentioned.  YET - when you take photos outside in the sunshine - they are actually quite decent.  I'm a photo snob, though - so nothing that didn't come from one of the Nikon DSLRs is suspect to me... DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE HOPING THIS WILL REPLACE YOUR COMPACT DIGITAL CAMERA.  My Blackberry phone camera is a million times better - and I still think that THAT stinks.\n\nWhile I'm on the subject - let's talk about Facetime.  Apple - it's a great product.  I really love it.  HATE that I can't use it on my iMac at home unless I upgrade to Snow Leopard - which I have no intention of doing.  Glad my son now has his own iPad 2 so that I can call him when I'm at work or on the road... So others who are reading this understand - the Facetime App is a billion times better than the Skype app.  Apple made Facetime to work on their computers.  Period.  As such, it takes those not-so-great cameras I just mentioned, and maximizes their abilities and functionality.  If you can call someone Mac to Mac - use Facetime.\n\nWhat else don't I like:  the cost of all of those add ons I mentioned.  Seriously!?!?  My choice to buy them.  I will stop my rant.\n\nWhat I HATE:  the smartcover.  It's horrible.  Don't waste your money on the smart cover!  It's not smart.  I bought the orange - and it's already dirty in the ridges (remember I take this everywhere, and to work... and I work as a project engineering overseeing large dirty and messy job sites) - but the orange was already a sick creamsicle color, but it is just lame.  It doesn't always \"snap\" to the edge with the precision shown in the video commercial.  Just buy something else.  Or save your money.  I am waiting for the Otterbox Defender to come out - since I now realize how much I will travel with this.\n\nEverything else - I love.  The list is long, and I won't bore you.  As a child, I dreamed of such a device... and it meets almost all of my desires and wishes for a non-human user interface.  The AT&T 3G is good enough, don't know if Verizon would have been better... I will always question my decision.  I can watch Netflix - but it doesn't hold coverage on my trainride... but then again, my cell phone from Verizon doesn't either.  There are lots of \"dead zones\" on my train ride to work.  When I'm stationary - in the woods, at a restaurant, in a store - the AT&T signal is typically strong enough to handle the most demanding streaming.\n\nVisually, this object is a stunner.  Physically, this object is a winner:  it feels great in your hands, is responsive to the touch, and it makes everyone want one...\n\nI recommend that anyone who has time on their hands buy one.  If you don't have time on your hands, don't buy one, since you will never sleep..... that is my woe..."}

Well I decided to buy iPad 2 and I was angry, but I knew I needed one for ONE reason is to count calories.  I've had it for about a week now, and I LOVE IT.  I really can't leave with ought it anymore. iPad 2 really is saving my life, with the apps to count my cal, my workout programs, and even my Dr. Can see what I eat and what I do at the gym.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I have purchased both an iPad2 and Xoom for different family members.  I thought it worth comparing the two devices for anyone interested.  Many of my comments are subjective so bear that in mind when reading the review.\n\nExternal appearance and feel:\nThe iPad2 screen has a different feel from the Xoom screen - the iPad2 is a bit slicker, less likely to stick when moving short distances.  The screen on the Xoom tends to show fingerprints more than the Ipad2 for some reason. Everyone in this family thinks that the iPad2 looks sharper than the Xoom.\n\nBoth weigh 1.6 lbs.  Subjectively, the Xoom feels heavier than the Ipad2, but it's an illusion perhaps caused by it's slightly smaller size.  UPDATE:  I need to learn to use the scales - the Xoom is about 3 ounces heavier than the iPad2.\n\nBoth have a similar size screen, measured diagonally.  But the aspect ratio is different - 4:3 for iPad2, 16:9 for Xoom.  This means that the iPad2 actually has a larger viewing area, and this makes a real difference when scrolling through a web site.  The iPad2 screen is brighter than the Xoom screen.\n\nHardware performance:\nThe Xoom feels a bit faster than the iPad2, and the specs show that it is faster.  Both have dual core processors based on ARM designs.  The Xoom seems to be able to handle graphics better than the iPad2.  As far as connecting to Wifi networks, both seem to have this one down pat - they both just work.\n\nUser Interface:\nThe iPad2 is just like a big iPhone.  Whether this good or bad is subjective.  For me, it's good - polished, flexible and can be customized to my needs.  The Xoom user interface is totally new, and unfortunately it shows - there are many rough edges.  Some examples: moving icons around to group programs together is not intuitive and they keep moving back; you can see the first 5 applications running on the Xoom and select one, but the list doesn't scroll so applications that don't show in the list can't be selected; you can't close applications (except by a force quit that can lose data) as the Xoom decides when to quit an application; customization is possible but more difficult than the iPad2.  In short, the Xoom user interface is a work in progress - great potential but currently quite flawed.\n\nOperating System:\nThe iPad2 uses Apple's IOS.  It works, but it uses cooperative multitasking which (in theory) is less effective than the full multitasking on the Xoom which uses a version of Google's Android designed for tablets.  In practice, they both work fine and I doubt anyone would notice the difference.\n\nApplications:\niPad2 has 70,000 apps available from the Apple App store and it also runs the 300,000 apps available for the iPhone.  Xoom currently has around 60 apps and it can run Android phone apps (but they are stretched in one direction which makes them look strange).  Some of the iPad2 applications are pretty impressive - GarageBand for example.  There are many games on the iPad2, and just a few games made for the Xoom.  If this doesn't improve quickly, the Xoom is sunk.  After all, applications are generally the reason people buy these devices.\n\nBrowsing:\nBecause of the screen aspect ratio that I mentioned, I prefer browsing on the iPad2.  The Xoom has Adobe Flash and the iPad2 doesn't, but so far I haven't come across a single instance where this has been an issue.  I'm sure there are very many sites not compatible with iPad2, but I haven't browsed to one of them yet.\n\nCamera:\nI don't use the camera much, and I'm not really sure if either is better.  In the family, the Xoom owner says the Xoom is better, the iPad2 owner says the iPad2.  The Xoom has flash and iPad2 doesn't which is a win for Xoom, but the Xoom seems slower to take a picture.\n\nSpeakers:\nThe Xoom has two small speakers, iPad2 has one slightly larger speaker.  The sound is somewhat better quality on the iPad2 and the Xoom cannot achieve the same volume as the iPad2.  But they are both pretty poor - use earphones or an external speaker if you want decent audio.\n\nBattery life:\nDifficult for me to give an exact comparison, but based on family usage it seems the iPad2 has the edge here, but not by much.\n\nInternal storage:\nThe Xoom has 1GB of RAM and 32 GB of flash storage.  The iPad2 has 512MB of RAM and 16GB, 32GB or 64GB of flash storage - I bought the 64GB model.\n\nExternal storage:\nThe Xoom has an external card slot that supports SD cards, but the software was not ready in time for the product release.  The slot is inoperative until Motorola releases an operating system update.  The iPad2 has no external storage support.\n\nUser Experience:\nThe iPad2 was up and running quite quickly.  I connected the device to iTunes and it automatically updated to the latest version of the operating system.  I was then able to select and download Apps immediately and start using them.\n\nThe Xoom was not so easy.  For some reason, I was not able to install the latest version of Google Maps or Adobe Flash.  I was able to download the apps, and the install process appeared to work without errors, but the new apps just were not installed.  After some time trying I finally returned the Xoom back to the factory settings and started again, and this time both the installs worked.  Of course, this wouldn't be a good solution if you had a ton of applications and/or data on the device.\n\nSupport:\nApple has their retail stores.  You can get a huge amount of help from these stores from people whose only job is to support users.  Both iPad2 and Xoom users have web sites available that support their products but you have to spend the time digging for the sites and digging through the sites.  You can also purchase an Applecare support package which gives you a couple of years extra support for the iPad2.\n\nBottom line:\nI believe the Xoom hardware may be slightly better than the iPad2 (apart from the screen aspect ratio and the speakers), but the software is terribly lacking.  The Xoom was released FAR too early, it's just not ready for primetime.\n\nIf I had to pick just one, I'd pick the iPad2 - less hassle, apps for everything, better browsing experience, better support options.  The Xoom needs less buggy software and more applications; it has potential but it's not there yet.  And by the time it gets there, there will be something better available.\n\nUpdate 7/5/2011\n\nWe have now had the two devices for over 3 months.  During that time Motorola released an update to fix some of the issues with the original Xoom.  It's somewhat faster, the problem of only seeing the first 5 applications is fixed, there are some extra capabilities for USB, and most importantly, the Xoom doesn't crash every few hours.\n\nHowever, the biggest issue with the Xoom is still the number of applications available to run in native tablet mode, as opposed to running Android phone applications.  I've read that there are 300 applications available, but it's hard to find them.  The Android Market doesn't distinguish between phone applications designed for a small screen  and tablet applications.  You have to read the description of each application to see what it is designed to run on, and finding 300 apps in 200,000 is very time consuming.  Apple claims to have 100,000 iPad specific apps in their store.\n\nAnother problem with the Android Market is the complete lack of supervision.  I understand that anybody can put any application there without any review, and I've read there have been a few problems with malware.  Recently I saw an article that claimed there are spyware applications on the store, which worries me a little.  I'm not saying you can't get malware from the Apple store, but Apple does look at the apps first - I'm not aware of any malware getting into the Apple store.\n\nThe iPad2 does have some downsides I wasn't aware of when I wrote my review.  It would be nice to have a general purpose USB connection and a card slot.  There is an extra-cost adapter available from Apple that supplies HDMI out and a limited function USB connector.  Also the keyboard attachment made for the original iPad doesn't work on the iPad2.\n\nFor us, the iPad2 is the winner.  The Xoom is sitting on a shelf and I don't think it's been used over a week now.  In contrast, iPad2 is in use every day and continues to be a big hit.  The primary problem with the Xoom is the lack of tablet-based applications.\n\nUpdate 7/7/2011\n\nThe Xoom has been sold to a colleague who wants an Android tablet.  I think the Xoom is better than most of the Android tablets currently available.  However, the Honeycomb software feels so unfinished, and the paucity of available tablet-based applications was a major issue.  I lost several hundred dollars on the sale, but nobody wanted to use it and there was no point in letting it lay around unused.  I'm already under some pressure to buy another iPad2, but I want to wait to see if the rumors of another iPad version in September are true."}

I loved the original iPad and felt Apple was really going to knock my socks off (and the onslaught of Android tablets) with it's new and improved tablet. To say the least i was completely underwhelmed.\n\nThe cameras may as well not even be there! The quality is aweful on both the front and the back. Apple made up for this by putting facetime software that is extremely sluggish on the I2! The main reason i got the I2 was to communicate with my wife and kids on facetime on her iPhone...\n\nThe new design (although impossibly thin and light) is very difficult to hold. The edges are kinda pointed  and its thinness leaves me feeling like it's going to slip out of my hands. The original I pad was one of the most ergonomically friendly devices ever made.\n\nThe performance (processor) isn't even noticeably different than the original. Don't try to comment and tell me \"well, the clock speed is actually blah, blah, blah...\" garbag! When I put it next to my wife's original and we load up the same apps and webpages its hardly different and in most cases no different. My wife laughed hard at me when i waiting ALL day for this dissapointing \"upgraded tablet\" and laughed even harder when hers performs just the same!\n\nIt's frustrating when you realize your favorite company hyped an inferior product this way. I'll NEVER walk away from Apple cause their quality is second to NONE. However, Apple lost this customer for good on tablets. I sold mine four days ago and got a Xoom WiFi and haven't put it down since."}

When I wrote an email to them on the 3/31 they responded in about 20 min max. It's so hard to find great customer service and not get scammed these days that \"We Ship Tech\" is a breath of fresh air!! I would surely use them again and highly recommend them to anyone who expects great products & service. Thank you We Ship Tech!!!!!"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Great unit, but be aware, the cameras, even the better, forward-facing one--really bite. Why they couldn't use the camera from the current iPhone, which is quite good, on this $500+ product, is beyond me. It is a huge flaw in an otherwise mostly outstanding beast.  On a more minor note, the Apple tendency to design for profit instead of ease of use is always maddening. Case in point:  The built in memory costs $100 for each additional 16GBs.  My (non-iPhone) phone has a removable mini SD card that cost $9 for 16 GB, and I can add memory at will, for very little money. This could easily have been the Apple approach with the iPhone & iPad. A mini SD is the size of a fingernail. So I still buy Apple products because they are so good in so many ways, but the affordability thing is kind of ridiculous. Their computers are better than PCs, no question, but should not cost fully twice to three times what a comparable PC costs."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "If you're deciding whether or not to buy an iPad 1 or iPad 2, you may want to read this first.  I've had an iPad 1 for 9 months.  Before I bought it, I doubted how much I would use it.  It had no hard drive, USB connectors, DVD player, camera, full keypad, ability to load major business software apps, ability to play flash-developed graphics, and it did not have much storage and memory space.  I wondered how it could be useful to me, since I had many Apple products - Mac Pro, Macbook Pro, iPhone, Mobile Me, Airport, Time Capsule, etc.\n\nTo my delight the iPad provided 100x my wildest expectations.  Once you start using it for searching the Web and researching just about everything you do, you realize how much more you can get out of the Web and Internet every day.  You begin making tons of use of the Web and it makes you become way more productive in life (home, autos, service providers, education, children, parenting, illness, job, professionally, etc., etc., etc.).  It ends up becoming an extension of your hand, mind, and life.  It doesn't take you over, it merely helps you with everything you do.\n\nEmail is also a different experience using an iPad.  You find yourself no longer reading email on your phone or computer.  You end up having your iPad with you, no matter where you are.  Email is extremely easy to read and is organized in way never thought possible.  I bring it in stores, theaters, healthcare providers, hair salon, work, lunch, and e v e r y w h e r e !!  it's way too easy to use and to make you much more productive.\n\nAll this, and I haven't even gotten to the thousands of extremely useful and productive apps, movies, podcasts, music, etc., available (via iTunes).  You can have every type of app, from sophisticated business intelligence dashboard software to first class presentation software, to science, astronomy, and tons of world-class games.  All in addition to the new extension to your brain and hand (mentioned above).  So, don't get hung up about USBs, DVDs, and hard disks.  You can get a VGA cable, external camera connection cable, and a myriad of cases and multi-use devices.  You will not even want your regular computer after a month.  iPad 2 brings us to a new level, with two cameras, 2x the speed, thinner/lighter, and great new OS features.  If you try an iPad for 30 days, you will never want tp be without it.  I do not sell iPads and I have NO affiliations with Apple or their resellers.  Load the Auryn Ink app and use a Nomad brush.  You'll swear you were really painting on a canvas.\n\nTransformed from iPad slayer to iPad bigot."}

The only thing I would add is the fact that store managers pointed out to me that the only way to do webcam is using Facetime. This is not true at all. I downloaded the yahoo messenger app and was able to do webcam with yahoo users on Windows PCs. For Ebook readers it is an awesome device. It has all the features of a Nook and if you turn the Ipad sideways (landscape) it will show both side of the pages as if you were reading a real book. I also like the graphics on the way the pages flip."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I purchased the original iPad 64GB with Wifi back in October of last year.  If I had know that an updated model was going to become available so soon, I would have waited for the iPad 2. So, do you really need the iPad 2?  Frankly, there are three major differences between the original iPad and the iPad 2.  First, the iPad 2 is noticeably lighter and sleeker.  It is more comfortable to hold for longer periods of time, especially if you like to read e-newspaers or ebooks. Secondly, the iPad 2's processor is a lot speedier.  Page turns are quick, boot time is fast, and surfing the internet is a breeze. Last of all, the iPad 2 has a camera. This, however, is its weakest feature. Do not expect the same results you would get from a digital camera or digital webcam. (I could have lived with a model that has no camera.) The other differences are minor (e.g., the automatic turn on/turn off feature). For me, the iPad 2 is a better product for what I needed (reading and surfing the net).  Before you get rid of your original iPad, I would check it out at a retail store along side your original."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Really people? For the money this thing is stripped down. They just now add a forward and back facing camera and everyone is like ooh cool. This feature has been on cell phones forever. It should of been added on the original ipad. Think about it. A cell phone has more features than an ipad. Smartphones now have high resolution front and rear facing cameras with flash, able to use the flash as a flashlight, sd card slots, cable hook up to t.v's, wifi, usb, physical keypads, can download music without proprietary software, and so on. All in one little package. Now don't tell me they don't have room on an ipad to add any features.\n\nYes they made this a little lighter and a little faster. But for the price you can buy a powerful laptop or netbook that will leave the ipad 2 in the dust. And you won't have to pay for proprietary cables or accessories for dowloading your pictures, files, music etc. like the camera kit, which doesn't work for all cameras or memory cards to transfer pictures. And don't forget you have to pay for all the Mac apps. And oh you want a physical keyboard? More money. Wait you better buy a protective case to protect your new investment that probably is adding up to almost a grand now. That's where Apple gets you. You have to buy their proprietary products and services. And they will add features and memory upgrades a little at a time to newer models so you will want the latest features. Just like their ipods and itouches.\n\nIf you are thinking about replacing a computer with this, then read on. If not, then read elswhere.\n\nAll that said...if you want to do work on it, consider getting a loaded netbook which is a better value and more powerful, more memory and you don't have to go through the hassle of downloading or uploading to another computer like you would have with an ipad. With a netbook you can just load data onto an sd card or thumb drive if you want to instantly. What if you don't have a computer around with an ipad and you want to transfer some files or pictures onto it or want to just download some files and take it with you on a thumb drive. Oh wait did you remember to bring the cables or adapter with you on top of that? Do you want adapters protuding from your expensive ipad waiting to be bumped and snapped off? Also do you use Windows or Mac? Is your printer cabable of over the air printing? If not then you have to either get a capable printer or transfer the data onto a computer that is hooked up to your printer. If it were not for the touchscreen, would anyone buy an ipad? HECK NO! It would be considered a featurless outdated piece of equipment comparable to something about 10 plus years ago. See where i'm going here. But on the same note, a netbook is not as portable. So weigh out your wants and needs. I ended up getting a netbook after research and playing with them and no regrets because I can do anything on it and it is a spare because the kids take up the other computer. I couldn't of done much with the ipad except surf the web. Example, my wifes work computer crashed and she was working from home. Well luckily she had the netbook because she hooked up the netbook to her lcd monitor and logged into a computer at her work place remotely and kept on working. And I also had the netbook hooked up another time to my flatscreen, an external hard drive, mouse, and an sd card in the slot so I could edit pictures, back them up and print them. I also had an extra usb port to spare where I could of had a phone plugged in to charge at the same time my netbook was charging also. Couldn't of done all this with an ipad let alone charge it at the same time if you had something plugged into it's single proprietary port. Get at least an 11.6 inch netbook if you decide on one and still want functionality and portability. Everything fits on the screen better and not crammmed in. Keep in mind though that some netbooks come with just Windows starter and not a full working edition. If you don't get the full working edition, then the netbook would not be of much use. But oh when I just want to lounge around and surf the web, I wish I had a tablet. But I use my phone for that, lame but it works. Oh yeah, I can tether my phone to the netbook also.\n\nPersonally I think this is mainly usefull for surfing the web or used as an electronic organizer for someone on the move who has to keep track of a lot of information or carries a clipboard i.e. invoices, work orders, short note taking, etc. or needs visual images out in the field. But to use in place of a real computer, no. You can buy apps. for the ipad to do some work on, but they are not as powerful. So think about what you want or need it for. Ask yourself something like this. Do you need something portable for school where you can do term papers and homework on, or for organizing and socializing? This is not a replacement for a computer if that's what you want. It is a media device with limitations features wise. Also with a netbook you can have a spare battery and swap it out and continue on. With an ipad you have to plug it in and wait for it to charge and it defeats the purpose of mobility doesn't it? Yes you ipad defenders, I know the battery charge lasts pretty long, but there are variables affecting it like what you are running and what if you forgot to plug it in overnight and you don't have time to charge it.\n\nI'm not saying a tablet doesn't have it's place because it does. And yes I know that an ipad and a netbook are two different things. But it may not serve your needs so be aware. I can see where an ipad or any other tablet would be more practical or even a no brainer because a clamshell design of a netbook might be just to clunky. I'm just pointing out the lack of features on the ipads. If they only would add a memory card slot or standard usb to make it simple to transfer data or so I can hook up other peripherals. I don't want to pull out cables or turn on my computer and sync it everytime I want to transfer data. But don't hold your breath. They want you to buy another one with more memory if you need more. A memory slot or usb would give you the option of adding more memory of your own. And it won't take you long to fill up the little memory the ipad offers if you like to load media onto it.\n\nSize and price should be taken into consideration if you want to use it for entertainment away from home a lot. There are several tablets offered from competitors now and some are less expensive, more features, smaller and lighter and don't use a lot of proprietary cables or software applications or hardware, they have sd slots and or usb also. Something you might want to think about if you like to dowload or upload stuff on the fly and travel light. But it comes down to you to research ask questions and try to get some hands on to \"see what works best for you\". Just don't expect that all the tablets perform the same or offer the same apps. Your not going to get ipad performance or huge selection of apps. to choose from compared to a tablet that costs way less. If you just want it to take on vacation while relaxing next to the pool or to keep kids entertained then a less expensive tablet might fit your needs so you can still enjoy yourself and not have to worry as much about it getting stolen, lost, or broken. As for the ipad, you might be to concerned with it to enjoy yourself or it is just too big and a 7 inch tablet is more convienient. But if you want your cake and eat it too. Take a look at the Asus Transformer and Asus Slider. The transformer has a detatchable keyboard with a mouse pad and battery that extends your battery life, two sd slots, USB ports, and you can adjust the angle of the screen and close it like a netbook. The slider has a keyboard build into the tablet and screen flips up. No mousepad though. But there is a USB port that you can hook up a mouse to if you want. Also with the Asus tablets you can multitask and listen to something in the background while doing something else. With the ipad you can't. The Asus tablets support flash and you are able to watch clips on web pages, whereas the ipad you don't get to watch the clips because most clips are flash. The Asus tablets will fit movies on to the screen better and not have the black bars on the top like on the ipad. People are even getting rid of their ipads to get the Asus. There are also a few tablets out there that run Microsoft Windows. So that was just an example of other opions you have out there. Another thing to think about is that there are a lot of phones running on Android as for tablets also. So there is going to be a lot more compatibility between devices because most of them will run on Android. With Apple your limited with their products and don't have other outside options. The tide will turn with more offerings for Android because it will become main stream because most devices and manufacturers now are adapting the Android platform,while the \"I\" line of products are only exclusive to Apple. Will be like the Beta max vs VHS. Beta had better quality but most manufacturers adapted the VHS format instead of Beta. Well Beta died because everyone was making VHS products.\n\nDon't slam me if your an ipad lover. It's just things to think about. Don't know why people get so defensive about negative reviews about this thing. They must be the ones replacing their old Apple stuff with the newer models that have the newest inovation (cough, cough). What's new for next year? A flash for the camera? Or wait, maybe a phone feature. That way you can get rid of your cell phone and only carry the ipad around and not have to carry both. There are a lot of fan boys out there defending the ipad with not much to back it up and they take it personal. I think they are in denial and trying to justify their purchase. Well people you are the ones Apple preys on and you fall for it.\n\nUpdate: I finally broke down and got an Acer 7 inch A100 tablet for my daughter for Christmas. And after using it for a while, I will still stand by what said about the limitations and uses of a tablet. And the Acer A100 is only 7 inches perfect size for holding for long periods of time or for traveling instead of a bulky 10 inch. it can keep up with the ipad2 and has ports for micro sd, micro usb, micro HDMI, and hey even a flash for one of the two cameras. Hear that? A simple flash for the camera. Oooh...Oh wait, the ipad3 might get that, can't wait, it will make it the best ipad ever. Whatever..."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "SUMMARY: White iPad 2 64GB Wifi-only\nA really wonderful electronic device for media consumption with some moderate content creation potential. This will likely change as more apps focused on content generation are created.  I find myself using it more and more simply because it is \"always ready\" and small enough that it is always near. If this device had a better file management system and a more robust way to share printers it would have gotten 5 out of 5 stars. As it is, the iPad 2 is a solid 4 star device.\n\nDELIGHTERS (Current features that exceeded my expectations)\nFORM FACTOR: Thin and comfortable to hold. Small enough to toss in a bag or carry around the house so you find yourself using rather than trying to \"remember\" to do \"that thing\" the next time you're at your computer. Still has some weight to it (1.3lb) so prolonged reading in certain positions will cause fatigue.\nAPP ENVIRONMENT: Really excellent variety and quality of applications for a broad range of uses and a broad range of prices. Also plays nice with content providers like amazon kindle, Google docs, and lots of news outlets.\nSLEEP MODE: It is seemingly \"always ready\" as it wakes from sleep very quickly.\nHDMI OUT: Granted there is a $40 accessory required it is nice to have the option of showing what's on your iPad 2 to a larger audience.\niOS: Overall the operating system is \"cleanly\" designed, features are easy to navigate and find.\nPROCESSING SPEED: Remarkably quick to load apps, web pages, pdfs, etc.\n\nSATISFIERS (Current features that met my expectation)\nHOMESHARING: Being able to share my iTunes library (music, movies, podcast, etc)  across my wifi network is wonderful and saves space on the iPad 2.\nSCREEN: Bright, good touch sensitivity, \"flips\" between orientations well, handles pictures and text with aplomb.\nPRICE: Reasonable considering the competition but nearly high enough to justify a \"real\" laptop\nAUDIO: Speaker is quite good for a handheld device, placement in portrait mode ends up in your lap but you can invert the iPad so not a huge deal. Also speaker faces rear of device instead of forward meaning you need to crank it louder than maybe otherwise necessary if it were forward facing.\nBATTERY LIFE: Battery holds up well even after a day of heavy usage, charges up easily over night. Can go 2-3 days without charging with moderate to light usage)\nWIFI: This simply \"works\". turn it on, detect a signal, and go. No messing around with complicated network settings.\nONSCREEN KEYBOARD: Its responsive and surprisingly easy to use. However, scrolling to a separate numbers keyboard and lack of a \"tab\" button really disrupts workflow.\n\nDISSATISFIERS (Current features that did not meet my expectations)\nFILE MANAGEMENT: File management on the iPad is Byzantine. You use iTunes to \"attach\" files to apps or email them?\nPRINTING: Unless you have an AirPrint capable printer (new hardware to buy) or one of a handful other printers you will need to use the atrocious \"file management\" system above to get the docs on you computer to print. Double whammy of pain!\nCAMERAS: The two cameras are adequate for video chatting but taking stills is a joke. True I wouldn't want to shoot a lot of birthdays holding an iPad but I would like to use a program like \"GeniusScan\" to photograph documents for later reference. The 0.7Megapixel camera is capable of \"barely legible\" documents.\nCOST PER GB: Paying >$3 per GB ($100 more for 64GB than 32GB) is nearly twice what you'd pay per GB for the difference in a stand-alone USB thumbdrive.\nTOUCH NAVIGATION: Ok so this is a general criticism of any touch device and there is no way to get around it really. Having \"grown up\" using keyboards and mice to interface with computers I am having to learn how to do tasks differently. Press-Hold, Swipe, Two vs Three fingers. All for tasks I was so used to doing with a Tab or Right-click.\n\nWISHLIST (features I'd like to see in the next-gen iPad)\nTouchscreen: The capacitive screen works fine for many things but writing notes with a \"fat\" stylus isn't one of them. Having a touch screen that doesn't require the \"fat\" stylus would greatly improve handwriting and note taking.\nUSB or SD Card ports (never gonna happen as Apple uses memory as a price differentiator but it doesn't hurt to dream)\nRetina display\nInfrared receiver/transmitter (Can anyone say universal remote!)\nGPS\nCheaper 3G antenna: $130 bucks extra for a 3G receiver plus I gotta buy a plan? ugh.\nSmartcover: Would like to see this included in the price of the device"}

Since the IPad uses dedicated memory, don't be surprised if the delivery date is extended out a bit since all the parts to put this wonderful device are just not out there.\n\nA device that's finally proven once and for all that we can compute different ways, this wonderfully powerful and as always easy to use device is proving why the tablet computer is our next exploding tech market.  Our head guy here at Amazon said in his interview here that we'll see over 40 tablet style computers on the market by this coming Christmas and now I understand why.  The simple fact is much of our time on line is spent simply reading stuff.  Then why carry around a keyboard we're not using?  Be it via Wi-FI or 3G, the upload speeds are simply astounding so we can read or watch videos at speeds that will astound even jaded users such as myself.  Don't look at an IPad 2 as a new computer.  Look at it as a different way of computing.\n\nAnother surprise with the IPad 2 is in their ability to handle business applications and environments.  The first generation was geared toward those who liked looking chic at overpriced coffee shops.  This model is a real tool - a real computer - a really different way of doing things in the most user friendly and portable way possible.  Do accept the fact that you'll be spending additional dough on accessories such as keyboard, screen protectors, a stylus and more, but thanks to Amazon I've found deals that's made this as painless as possible - actually quite affordable!\n\nDo we need one, of course not.  Will our lives be a whole lot more fun and even more productive with one, beyond a doubt.  Don't hurt yourself buying one, but if you're like me and would rather live without pizza and beer twice a month so I can afford my latest toy, then this is something any user will have a blast with in everyday life no matter what you're doing.  Now why haven't you got yours ordered yet?"}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I bought the first generation ipad and was pretty pleased with it.  I must admit that I had alot more fun with the ipad 1 due to the fact that it was unlocked, so I virtually got everything free.  The only problem, if you will, is that it lacked a webcam, and the ipad 2 solved that very problem!  Although the webcam isn't the best out there, it gets the job done, but if you're looking for a professional resolution, prepared to be dissapointed!  Ipad 2 basically does exactly the same thing as the first generation in terms of features. The only difference is the fact that it's thinner and lighter (HALLELUJAH!).  I enjoyed it when it arrived, but just gotta wait for a jailbreak to enjoy its full potential, but so far has the same limitations such as no flash, glares on the screen in sunlight, not bullet proof (sarcasm intended) etc.  In general the ipad is not for school, work, or anything serious of that nature (I TRIED typing a 2000-word essay, surely was not fun).  Things like the ipad is just for the trend and casual uses like surfing the net, it looks cool, fun to play with, but is not gonna beat a laptop in terms of effiency and definitely not internet speed.  Overall an OKAY experience, if I had a jail break I'd definitely upgrade this rating :PP"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The iPad is an invaluable travel companion if you are a frequent travelet.\n\nWhy do I preffer black vs white? If what you mostly do is watch videos on your iPad you want it with the black bezel because the video will blend with the black bezel and look larger than with the white it becomes kind of a distraction, this is the reason why most TV's in the market have a dark or a black bezel.\n\nPortability of this thing is amazing, Its light and its easy to lug around when you are traveling. Also the battery life is exceptional, I'm bad at keeping my devices charged up and I have done a couple of 8 hour trips and my ipad was stil kicking when I landed and a few days after, Im truely surprized.\n\nFor those of you debating between the 3GAT&T, 3GVerison or the Wifi version, it depends on where you go to. I had the original 32 wifi only and I was very happy with it I noticed I got Wi-Fi access at a lot of places and I could also use the wifi hot spot on my phone to connect however, in recent travels I have been sent to middle of nowhere america where AT&T has no 3G coverage and hotels have no wifi (yes they are out there, hotels that still have no wifi) after I returned from my last trip to said location I decided I should get the Verizon iPad simply from the coverage perspective and since the 3G service is not on contract and the Verizon plans have more options I decided that was my choice. Now is this the best option for everyone, no! I think the 3G is just for a small amount of users the vast majority should be fine with a 16GB or a 32GB, if you know your way around the app market place and apps like Air Video Server and tools like DVD Fab and TVersity you don't need that much storage space on your iPad you can simply stream everything. Besides, I have a 32GB and I have 57 videos loaded in that 32GB iPad which if I watch 10-12 on a trip it is an overstatement, I'll watch a few on the plane but the rest, Im streaming from my Media Center at home or from NetFlix. When talking to people in line I was shocked at the number of people looking for the Verizon version when they do not travel, people if you are home most of the time just use your wifi, its cheaper and its faster! Another thing to note is that if you are an international traveller and want 3G the Verizon iPad is NOT Global wireless (so no 3G anywhere outside of the US) however wifi will work just fine.\n\nYou will see people complain about resolution and such and honestly, I think the resolution is perfect, the iPad is not meant to replace your laptop or your desktop or your TV, if it was why they would have bothered with airplay? If you are expecting to dump your laptop because you got an iPad think again, if you just use your laptop for browsing pages and playing games then you might get away with it however if you expect to do Office on these, think again, until MS gets their act together and decides that IOS is another venue of revenue for them I will still need to carry my laptop around to do word/excel/ppt files. Lack of flash support has not bothered me, yes I wish I could see some pages however, Im not in to the too flashy stuff (no pun intended) I rather get the straight text and keep going my only gripe would be that when Im conected via WiFi I would like to get full pages and not the mobile version however that is not an iPad problem it is a server problem.\n\nOverall my score goes as follows\nComfort and portability A+\nBattery Life A+\nApp Diversity and usability A+\nInterface A+\nExpandibility C (I don't need a USB port or anything like that however it is annoying that if I ever needed and expansion either I have to pay for an adapter or its not available)\nTV Out Support B+ (simply judging that for HDMI you have to buy the dongle)\nCammera Quality C (who needs a cammera in their iPad anyways? Face time sure, rear facing meh)\n\nOther thoughts:\n\nGet a screen protector, I tried the Invisible Shield for my Gen 1 and hated it, the material removes the slickness of the screen and makes it harder to interact. I like the Splash screen protector, it is like its not there and it does make cleaning a bit easier.\nGet a case this thing is beautiful but if you would like to maintain its resale value get a case that cover both front or back or separate covers, I think the Vapor case hack is pretty interesting.\nInvestigate tools like DVD Fab Video Converter (excellent for making iPad versions of your DVD's and BD's and it does take care of EVERYTHING for you from conversion to the right format to importing to iTunes) TVersity and Air Video for content streaming.\nBe realistic on your expectations, I know Apple calls their products magic and their user interface and experience is fenomenal however there are limitations as to what these things can do so try to make an informed purchase that you are happy with instead of rushing and then having something that doesnt meet your expectations.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "Apple fans are loyal (almost to the point of being fanatic) and are a loveable enough lot but one that can get quite upset if one pans an Apple product.\n\nBelieve it or not, I've come to praise the iPad 2 but with some modest reservations.\n\nI was an early adopter (standing on line the day it went on sale and patiently waiting for it for almost 5 hours).  Naturally, I was impressed at how quick and easy it was to use.  A lot of thought has gone into the product and it shows.  Instant on (I have the magnetic cover) is a bonus and the screen - large and crystal clear - is not so much a selling point but rather a \"how to\" example for other tablet manufacturers to follow.\n\nThe Apple store in the meatpacking district of New York City has a qualified, and very friendly, staff who set the unit up for me while they answered my various questions. Considering that they had been doing this since 5 PM and it was now after 10, that is a lot of dedication for one staff!  The most amazing thing is: they were all quite proud of the iPad 2. It says a lot when the company employees are that loyal.\n\nAnd the iPad 2 deserves such praise.  The product is, in short, wonderful.  Light weight yet with a solid feel to it, I plan on taking mine to Europe shortly.  After you turn it on, the balance of the iPad 2 is self-explanatory.  From the opening screen of icons, the touch screen makes it almost too-easy to take the product that seriously. But it is a useful tool what with a Calendar, notebook, iPod, photo studio, etc. Naturally the much hearalded APP STORE is there and works fine and at a lightning speed.  Although I wonder about the \"10 hour battery life\" claim - it does manage to work long enough to please the most diligent of users.\n\nWhere the iPad falls short is in the area of productivity.  Much discussed, and a sore point, is the lack of a USB port. In todays day and age, that is almost an unforgivable sin. I did get the hook up so I could download my pictures (it works too - and, again, it does it so fast and so effortlessly that it is a minor miracle). There is something almost childish in the decision not to include at least one USB port especially after the loud fracas that happened after the release of the first iPad.  FLASH is another sore point and, frankly, one that I don't understand. There is some conflict going on with the world of APPLE and flash so we don't have it. This makes it very difficult to surf the web. Safari is quick but without flash, it misses one of its major components. Again, and this is just my feeling, this is something that could have been corrected quite easily - starting a year ago with the original.  Now, the iPad 2 (and the original version, I'm sure) can still do quite an amazing amount of work without these two features but as they are considered standard, it is a puzzle as to why the iPad 2 did not have both of them installed.  Also, the lack of a port decreases the iPad's place in the workforce. How can you install, let's say, OFFICE MAC?  The system can print (via Bluetooth) so it could be used as an Office-on-the-run (held landscape, the keyboard is quite easy to do some very fast typing upon - one could produce an awful lot of work on it but . . . without a CD drive to install programs, it makes it difficult).\n\nOther than that, the unit is nothing short of brilliant. Reading books on it is a pleasure (in most cases the iPad 2 is lighter than a paperback so that is saying a lot) and the wide assortment of apps makes it a standard tool that nearly everybody should own."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The Apple iPad.  Those of us who own one have recently been called less than flattering names for daring to use it and enjoying the experience!  But the devices' popularity is growing; indeed I am seeing them everywhere.  Just yesterday I sat next to a woman at my local Ford dealership who was reading a book on her iPad even as I held a text message conversion with a good friend while reading the news from CNN and NPR.\n\nFor me the device fulfills several different functions I have been meaning to purchase in separate devices, like an e-book reader, portable music player for my master bedroom, and electronic photo frame.  Why buy all three of those devices when the Apple iPad does all three functions in one neat silver (albeit expensive) package?  And since buy my iPad in the Fall of last year, the uses for the device have grown tenfold, until now, it is almost indispensable.\n\nNow Apple has released the iPad 2 and those of us who use the original are throwing them over for the next big, or should I say smaller thing.  Since this new one was for the business I work for I decided to do a one for one replacement of the one I already used for testing purposes; in other words I ordered an \"iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G\" version.\n\nThe \"iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi /3G\" Facts\n\nOn the surface the iPad 2 is not demonstratively different from the iPad Original.  Featuring a Dual-core (Apple designed) 1 GHz A5 processor, the 1.33 pound (1.34 pounds for the 3G) iPad 2 is notably thinner than the iPad Original, though the screen size stays the same.  The other big changes: two camera, one rear facing, the other front facing now ship standard with all models; and the graphics are reportedly 9 times as fast.\n\nNo matter what hardware version (Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi/3G, 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB) you chose the Ultra-Portable, iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/ 3G is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the far left.  Along the right edge of the 0.5\" thick iPad you'll find the screen lock/mute and volume control switches, while the bottom of the 9.56\" long device is reserved for speakers and the USB/power port.  The USB port is proprietary so, no, like the iPad Original you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord you can plug it into your computer and into an outlet to recharge the device.\n\nThe \"iPad 2\" (also available in black and white body styles) can be had with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of memory, and all iterations are fitted with a 1GHz Apple A5 custom-designed, high performance, low-power processor.  Internet connectivity is through either Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), and or 3G: UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz) and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).  Bluetooth 2.1 EDR is also provided with either configuration.  A 4G model of the iPad2 has not been announced.\n\nThe 9.7-inch fingerprint resistant LED-backlit glossy widescreen multi-touch color display offers 1024x768 resolution and can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.  The IPad 2 is fitted with an ambient light sensor and the device supports 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable and 1024x 768 with Dock Connector to VGA adapter.\n\nThe back camera can be used for HD (720p) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera with 5x zoom.  The front camera can also be used for (VGA) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera pictures.\n\nNew Apps that ship with the iPad 2 include FaceTime a real-time video chat application that allows you to calls someone else's iPad 2, iPhone 4, new iPod touch, or Mac over Wi-Fi and establish a video chat session.  The App will not work via 3G.  The other new App is Photo Booth an application that allows you to take pictures of yourself with various effects.\n\nAudio playback response frequency is 20Hz - 20,000Hz and the iPad 2 supports the following audio formats:\n\no  HE-AAC (V1)\no  AAC (16 to 320 Kbps)\no  Protected AAC (from iTunes Store)\no  MP3 (16 to 320 Kbps)\no  MP3 VBR\no  Audible (formats 2, 3, and 4)\no  Apple Lossless\no  AIFF\no  WAV\n\nThe iPad can view the following document types:\n\no  Images (.jpg, .tiff, .gif);\no  Documents (.doc and .docx (Microsoft Word), .txt, .pdf, .rtf);\no  Web pages (.htm and .html);\no  Keynote (.key);\no  Numbers (.numbers);\no  Pages (.pages);\no  PowerPoint (.ppt and .pptx)\no  Outlook Contacts (.vcf);\no  Excel (.xls and .xlsx)\n\nRe-syncing with iTunes\n\nThe iPad 2 will sync up whatever Apps, music, Podcasts, movies, etc., connected/ associated with your iTunes account and currently on your iTunes desktop.  I was able to sync the iPad 2 to iTunes and like magic everything that was on my iPad 1 showed up on my iPad 2, sans the folders I had set up to group Apps in.\n\nTransferring My AT&T 3G Account\n\nAll of the iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G devices I have purchased thus far use AT&T for their 3G service.  There are two plans at the time of this review: $14.99 for 250MB a month data package and $25.00 for 2GB date package.\n\nA funny thing happened along the way to transferring my current 3G plan to my new iPad 2: AT&T killed (deactivated) the removable SIM card in the iPad 1.  They claim they needed to, but I'm not so sure, because it makes no sense to me.  Another (micro) SIM card can be obtained from the nearest AT&T store for free, though so stores may charge you $15.00, so check around.  Once the new SIM is inserted into the iPad 1 you can set-up and activate the 3G service on the device.\n\nNote: unused data package byte (for lack of a better term), cannot be rolled over from month-to-month.  Conversely, if your plan minutes run out during the month AT&T will not automatically anoint you with more; more minutes can be purchased from the iPad 2, but it is a manual process.  However, the package will be renewed at the end of the 30 days, and continue to renew every 30 days unless stopped.\n\nMicrosoft ActiveSync\n\nSurprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, setting up the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G to use Microsoft Exchange via Exchange ActiveSync is simple and easy; all told it took less the two minute to start receiving my business e-mail on the device, and there does not seem to be a limit to the number of devices associated with a given ActiveSync account.\n\nAfter I established the connection via ActiveSync I verified inbox functionality by reading, responding to, forwarding, and moving, e-mail.  The iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G even allows you to choose whether or not you want to download your business contacts and calendar; sweet!\n\nAnd once connected I am able to control password usage, minimum and maximum length, age, complexity, and expiration via an Exchange ActiveSync policy.  The policy can also control other aspect of the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G's including third-party e-mail account creation; Windows SharePoint Services and Windows File Shares access; message size limits; attachment downloading, as well as a host of other security related features and functions.\n\nWord to the wise: Exchange ActiveSync policies, limited as they can be configured to disable a number of features on the device including camera, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.  And yes, utilizing ActiveSync I can even wipe the iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G from the Exchange server, and as long as the tablet remains a part of the ActiveSync policy it will continue to wipe every time its powered on unless it is either removed from the policy or the check mark is removed from the radio button instructing ActiveSync to \"Perform a remote wipe to clear mobile device data.\"\n\nVPN Access\n\nThe iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G has VPN access and it actually work quite well.  There are three options: L2TP, PPTP, or Cisco IPSEC. Like Exchange ActiveSync the VPN functionality was surprisingly easy to set up and get going, all one needs to know is what information to plug in and away we go!\n\nVPN took less than a minute to set up and configure, and once complete I was able to log into my company Intranet and thanks to some (free) Apps I was able to RDP into my workstation from the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G; again, sweet!  Yes, the lack of makes maneuvering around the desktop somewhat challenging, but I could still get around the desktop and use it.  Note: there are paid versions of the Apps I used that offer crude mouse functionality.\n\nLike all of the network components on iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G VPN can be togged on and off at will.\n\nFirst Impressions:\n\nLike my personal iPad 1, I really, really, really, like the Apple iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G I have been testing.  Naysayers aside this thing is cool and I am happy to own one and even take it out in public!  I love being able to take my favorite book(s) with me when I am on the go, and I have the ability to stop at a Wi-Fi hotspot and plugging into the Internet in order to read the latest news, get the weather, run an application, etc.\n\nBut, I really like the fact that I can take the lightweight iPad 64GB Wi-Fi/3G with me everywhere and still gain access to my pre-selected books, magazines, music and images, not to mention a seemingly endless supply of useful applications.  And let's not forget the Internet and business e-mail.\n\nToday while was waiting in line (yes I said line) for my dealership to open up so I could get me car serviced, I brook out my iPad 2 and started watch videos on Vevo; now how cool is that?\n\nSetting up Wi-Fi is easy enough; the antenna is always on and looking for new connection.  I set up the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G to use the secure wireless setup at work; I typed in the pass-phrase via the incredibly handy keyboard and surfed the Internet; simple and easy.  Since I bought the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G I have taken it out frequently to places that offer free Wi-Fi access and in only one instance did I have an issue connecting.  Nice!  And even then I effortlessly switched to 3G and, instance access.\n\nConclusions\n\nLike the iPad 1 before it the iPad 2 is the must have device of the decade, period!  Not a day goes by when I do not use it for something.  I love the portability of the device, the ease of use, the utilitarian nature of the unit, thanks in large part to the plethora of Apps that can be down loaded and utilized for the tablet.\n\nIs the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G ready for the enterprise?  I say yes with a few caveats; chief among them is the inability of the tablet to truly manipulate Microsoft Office Applications without the assistance of the Documents-to-Go application ($9.99).  Second is the inability to truly mirror the iPad screen on a monitor, however with the Apple Digital AV Adapter that can be changed.  Video can be presented onto the screen--via an HDMI connection.  Lastly, is the lack of available USB port(s) or a memory card reader that will accept memory devices and help you keep files organized on-the-go, as well as the ability to truly turn the iPad into a mobile office.  As it stands now any document you want to work with must be e-mailed and then opened.  However, the iPad was never marketed as a laptop, or laptop replacement, so...\n\nNot that these problems cannot be overcome, but they are limitation that a laptop and even netbooks do not suffer from.  However, hands down, the Apple iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G is a performance winner, and one heck of an e-book reader! Yes, the entrance fee (799.00) is steep, and enterprise customers will have to think long and hard at the cost, however the iPad now has a certain \"cool\" factor that is hard to escape.  The more large enterprises adapt the iPad and find practical uses for it, the more popular it will become in the hall of corporate America.\n\nSo far the iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi/3G has more than lived up to my expectations and I have fun testing the limits of its ability to operate effectively in the enterprise and personal environments."}

Right now, it is the last gadget in demand of the family, firmly behind a toshiba notebook, a kindle, and android phone. We mainly use it to surf the web. But without flash, it becomes quite annoying. I often have to switch to a pc to continue surfing for video and games etc. So we end up using it to play plants vs zombies or other game apps or surfing the web when the computer is taken. Even watching streaming movie on it is stressful, which requires holding the iPad compared with placing a notebook on a surface. Then we realized that iPad is a fashion. It is not as good reading device as kindle because of the weight and LCD display. It is not as good as pc for many tasks requiring keyboard, storage and multitasking. It is slow. It could be a good surfing device if it supports flash. To prove my point, it takes me a great deal of effort to type this review. Try place the cursor by tapping on the touch screen."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "I will admit that the cameras on the iPad 2 are not the greatest but the naysayers have to admit that the iPad 2 is so much faster and thinner than the first generation (to me, that makes it a great update).  I Skyped my parents in Florida for the first time last night (there is no HD version of Skype, so you have to 2X it to fill the screen) and it worked very well.  Last year, I played around with a friends original iPad and decided to be patient and wait for the iPad 2.  So glad I did, the iPad 2 is FAST.  Apps open instantaneously and it is a sleek machine.  I have a hard time putting it down.  I realize that the iPad 3 will probably have some major upgrades but if you have waited for the iPad 2 just get one and enjoy it.  It is the best tablet out there!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "If you're considering a tablet, the only rational choice is the iPad 1 or the iPad 2. Anything else you there is too expensive/too buggy/lacking support/etc. As someone who owns a desktop but no laptop, the iPad 2 is just perfect. A laptop would often be redundant, though it would be handy for working outside of the home.  With the iPad, I will use it all the time both in the home and elsewhere.\n\nI will try to add some comments that haven't been covered:\n\n* I find that 16gb is fine, though this may change if app sizes get much larger. I don't intend to store my music or a bunch of videos on this. Videos can be streamed, or added as-needed, and I rely on DropBox to store files - it lets me view and edit files between my desktop and my iPad.\n\n* Part of the reason the iPad is perfect for travel is that you can use it in any position, unlike a laptop, where you have to find a seat.\n\n* It won't ever got hot or overheat. Personally, I've had a couple laptops expire on me due to overheating. You always have to keep them on a firm surface so you don't block the vents. The iPad doesn't have these problems (I think that the Macbook Airs similarly will never overheat). You no longer have to grab a tray or giant book to set your laptop on when using it in bed.\n\n* Terrific value. All hype aside, the design, durability and capability of an iPad 2 is such that I would expect to pay much more. You can find a cheap laptop for the same price, and it will be capable of much more. However, the iPad will accomplish 95% of what you want to do on a computer, and will open doors (via apps) to new and totally unexpected experiences.\n\n* Browsing the web is better on the iPad. At least, it often is. It's certainly better to take your iPad on the couch than to hunch over a laptop on the coffee table. Though the screen is small compared to a desktop screen, it's equivalent to working on a bigger screen because of how close you will be. Scrolling and navigating a webpage with your hand is a qualitatively better experience than using the tools we've become accustomed to (mouse, trackball or trackpad). I guess that's why sci-fi movies always depict computers with touch interfaces in the future. Moving the page around and adjusting the size of everything by hand never gets old.\n\n* Just like with my iPhone 4, I rarely sync my iPad 2. I'm not a huge fan of iTunes. I can sync occasionally to back-up my apps. I don't use iTunes to manage files (again, I rely on Dropbox). Dropbox and Evernote are must-have apps on all my computers and portable devices.\n\n* Safari can use some work. I prefer the tabbed browsing, not having to switch windows. There are some alternative browsers (I bought 360 Browser, which is good), but Apple won't let me select those as my default browser. I don't use Safari on my desktop, but even if I wanted to sync my passwords and history, I don't think it'll let me (it will sync bookmarks through iTunes though). I really wish Apple would loosen up so that Firefox or Chrome would be available, and that one of those could be my default.\n\n* As cool as the smart cover is, I spent my money on a wireless keyboard instead. I really don't think the smart cover is going to make a difference as long as I take other measures to protect my screen. I may skip the HDMI adapter as well - it would be fun, but there is never a time that I will need to project my iPad on my HDTV.\n\nIn summary, if you think you'd like it, you'll probably love it. If you are just kinda curious but content with your current set-up, you can save yourself the money. For the same price, you can get an adequate laptop running Windows 7. I think this is a great alternative though."}

After using it for weeks though, I can honestly say it is perfect and has no problems that I can comment on.

I would get black though, I see the white becoming faded and not as clean looking after a while."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "So I'm in the kitchen, listening to my music library, and typing a review for the I-Pad 2. I have put a little more than 14 hours of research and 6 hours of non-stop use. I'm not gonna waste my time writing the specs for this device because if you are reading this I assume you already know the specifications, if not you can easily access the Apple website and do your own research. This review is aimed more towards the educated consumer. A consumer, who like me, has spent various hours of the night researching and contemplating his or her next moves.\n\nFirst, I want to start off with the word \"tablet\", what is a tablet and who needs it? As an avid P.C. user, I tend to define the device as too short, too little. A underpowered, pre-mature device not ready for this day and age. The truth is, their are more people out there who need a tablet versus a laptop. Having a quad core, overclocked, power hungry P.C. I am like most other users; who tend to have a bias when selecting/comparing  portable products. I have been for some time; looking for a laptop with great battery life, portability and power? I first went out and purchased a Macbook pro for about $1199+ some. After a couple weeks of use I was in love. I could not stop showing it off and playing with it. Then I attempted to play games and yes they were playable! But I found myself running to my P.C. whenever I was gonna get serious and then I found myself using my desktop when editing videos. Yet again, I found myself running to my P.C. when it came to doing anything that involved time and effort... It was at this point that I realized that I never used my laptop for more than a hour. Utilizing a mere 20-40% of its power. I used it for; writing papers, showing off pictures and Internet browsing. So I decided to return it. In search for something that made sense.\n\nI never considered a net-book useful or even worthy of my time, even less a tablet. The Motorola Xoom came out and I thought it had potential compared to last years 256MB I-Pad. It offers 1GB of internal memory and 32GB of storage space, all for $599. It not only had the potential, but also the power I craved. Although, its pre-mature operating system was a deterrence. This is the same thing that turned me away from the original IPad. Dispite the fact that I liked the original, if people didn't demand it, the product would die and I would be left with a 500 dollar piece of silicon or waste. I needed something portable and practical. I just felt the tablet was a little more practical, if not more useful too because of its  portability and extended battery life. So I took the plunge and got the Ipad 2.\n\nFirst impressions didn't fall short; it was easy to set up, had a beautiful screen, and gorgeous aesthetics. While Apple boasts about its 60,000 app's, I'll tell you what, it's not enough (way better than android though). While you can download IPhone and ITouch apps; they are simply not the same (a 3.5inch app on a 9inch screen). Face Time also seems to be problem, since it cost money for all your friends who don't have an IPad 2 or new Macbook. Tango or Skype are excellent alternatives, but still only supported in a 3.5 inch window. Despite this, it has some killer apps (e.g gmail, calendar syncing, web browsing and etc). My favorite app is TeamViewer, which gives you remote access to your PC from anywhere. This app is simply amazing. I was able to install some programs to my PC from school! While It doesn't support flash, it plays almost every video stream I've seen from the web. Hey, that's all I needed anyways. So I can't complain, but all you flash gamers might.\n\nNow I found this whole \"touch-typing\" thing to be an exasperation. Since I am primarily using this product for note taking, its important I am as accurate as possible. Keys kept skipping and words kept missing. So I upgraded to the Apple-wireless-keyboard.. sigh. It was a well spent 69.00 dollars (cheaper models are available). I am able to control volume, brightness and music. Also makes my tablet feel more like a high end net-book. I want to talk a little bit more about writing. I bought this tablet with the intention of using google docs. Well it works, but you have use the mobile version, which has limited functionality. I tried switching to desktop editing, but it was horrendously slow and unworkable. As a matter of fact I'm writing this with google docs now. As long as you are not using bullet points or etc; you should be fine. I do notice some errors that result from a slow ping, so it's worth trying noting it happens. I could more easily recommend using apple's built in \"note-taker\". Its responsive, practical and free.\n\nAs far as \"Air-Play\" goes, simply amazing. Kind of a pain to set up though. One really has to go into every setting in I-Tunes and mark share libraries under preferences and account profile. When the set up is complete, you simply log in with your I-pad and use the same mobile user name and you are good to go. Of course you have to keep your computer running the whole time unless you have a dedicated server of some sort. Air-paly grants you access to your music, videos and HD collection. which makes that whole HDMI out thing really convenient. Granted its only 720p, Ive never noticed a huge difference between 720 and 1080p Additionally stream times are relatively quick. Just keep in mind this depends a whole lot on your network. Which bring me to my next issue of storage. I honestly feel the only thing anyone needs on tablet is, pictures and apps. Unless you are going on a long trip; a couple movies. I am content and don't think I would ever need an I-Pad with more storage. As far as 3G goes, will its just that. A three year old bandwidth solution. If you can get a tethering plan instead, I would highly recommend it, as you can also transplant GPS automatically when tethering.\n\nAll in all I'm really content I took the I-Pad 2 plunge. A dive, I really never saw myself taking or considering. Having an android phone and P.C.; it would seem like honeycomb would have made more sense; considering the attractive specs and all. None the less, the IPad 2 meets my draconian standards for 2011. Making any other device look over weight and under-spec'd. While the consensus of professional reviewers have voted the camera insufficient, I could honestly say it does what I need it to do, which is provide fun and entertainment. The rear HD camera is similar to the one installed on the new macbook pro models (2011 refresh). Other than that, I don't plan on taking high quality photos with the device. I might do future reviews with the camera though. check out my youtube channel for video reviews, just look up oceansidecreations."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0013FRNKG", "review": "The first iPad really defined the tablet market and while a trickle of competing tablets were released, none of them has matched the critical acclaim of the iPad 2. The consensus of CNET, Engadget and most other tech reviewers is that the Motorola Xoom is the closest competitor, but falls just short of iPad.\n\nThis latest version of iPad sports a thinner design, front and back camera for casual filming and FaceTime/Skype video calls, a gyroscope, better speaker and, of course, a dual-core processor and 9x faster graphics capabilities. You still get the 10 hour battery life, but it's all wrapped up in a nicer package. That said, it doesn't seem drastically different than the original iPad and it feels like this version is simply an iPad with cameras, and the cameras don't perform especially well.\n\nGranted, the increased graphics capabilities do make a noticeable difference in the handful of games that take advantage of the increased speed (\"Infinity Blade\", \"Real Racing 2 HD\"), but most of the apps I use most frequently - e.g. CNN for iPad, Netflix, ABC Player, iTunes Video, iBooks, Pandora, SiriusXM, Apple Remote - don't feel like the user experience changed much beyond the increased volume coming from the speaker.\n\nMy big disappointments with the iPad 2 are that the cameras aren't great, though that's forgivable since I'd use them mostly for video calling anyway, and that the screen didn't increase in resolution from the first generation iPad! I want my Retina display!\n\nHowever, overlooking the faults of the iPad 2, it's still the best tablet on the market, in my opinion.\n\nMy kids love the educational apps (\"Monkey Preschool Lunchbox\", \"First Words Animals\", \"Shape Puzzle HD\", \"Talking Larry\", \"Peekaboo Barn\" and \"Garage Band\" are all highly recommended), and I think they've gone a long way in teaching even my mildly autistic daughter memorization and puzzle solving skills!\n\nI also love that I can get paid content from apps lie Netflix, (Comcast) Xfinity TV and Hulu+ and even free content like on-demand \"Bachelor\" episodes and other shows from the free \"ABC Player\" app. There's just so much capability available to the device through apps and certainly, the wealth of apps available in the App Store is one of the iPad's biggest strengths vs. competitors!\n\nIt's also a great device for checking email and casually surfing the web, as long as the site you view doesn't require Flash, which is still unsupported. I used to have a netbook that took 5 minutes to boot, then had an awkwardly small browser window and slow response, but you see nothing but instant-on capability and smooth navigation with iPad. I'd definitely prefer this tablet to a netbook!\n\nAlso, a couple of other miscellaneous tips for those interested:\n\n1. The new magnetic&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Smart-Cover/dp/B004QKM3AA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Smart Cover</a>&nbsp;from Apple is a must-try! The automatic wake and sleep on opening/closing the cover is more handy than you might first think, as is the ability to roll the cover into a stand for the iPad! We watched Netflix from bed while my wife nursed our baby recently, and it would have been a pain without the handy stand!\n2. If you buy an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/AirPort-Express/dp/B0002GDIII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">AirPort Express</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Apple-TV/dp/B001FA1NK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Apple TV</a>, you can wirelessly stream music (and video in the case of the Apple TV) to a remote set of speakers using AirPlay or the Apple Remote app! It's cool to be able to listen to my iTunes content from my kitchen with the iPad as remote control!\n3. If you're debating whether to buy the WiFi-only or the WiFi/3G iPad, it's worth noting that by paying for the WiFi hotspot capabilities on an iPhone 4, you can not only get data, but location services for your iPad 2, so you can save a couple hundred dollars on hardware and future-proof your connection speed since you can buy a new phone instead of a new iPad to take advantage of increased network speed.\n\nIn summary, I highly recommend the iPad 2 if you're in the market for a tablet. Its apps are highly entertaining, portable and easy/quick to launch a play, and it just may change the way you surf the web and check email! Even your kids will love it!\n\nThe few innovations this model sports aren't what they could have been, but are nonetheless compelling."}
