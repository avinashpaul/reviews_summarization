{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "Great battery life. Nice and fast. Everything works well as always. I prefer this model over the ipad air.\n\nWell the thing is the ipad air and ipad mini retina have virtually the same performance - ipad air is 4% faster. Plus they display at the same resolution, despite the smaller screen, so ipad mini just has a sweet like 348 dpi resolution, better than the air by quite a bit. The ipad mini is infinitely more portable - it can fit in a small purse or a coat pocket. The even get the same battery life. The more condensed screen is easier to type on with thumbs and less fatiguing on the eyes in terms of travel. I could only see someone preferring an air for old eyes or if watching movies with others is a big priority."}

The screen I clear and has great graphics. One thing I dislike about the iPad mini is the battery life. Then again, I am constantly using it since my MacBook isn't working. All-in-all, it's a great alternative to a MacBook. Just minus the memory space. And I did receive the 16GB one as a gift, so no complaints."}

Apple doesnt agree to give warranty on it because it been resold by VIPOUTLET after initially purchase from Walmart a year and two month ago  even though I own it for only eigth months. On the other hand VIPOUTLET doesnt agree to give warranty on it because it is outside of their 90-days warranty. I try to take the iPad to repair by a third part company and the price for replacing the battery was almost the same as a new iPad. Its a waste of money, I should of bought this iPad directly from apple."}

But when I opened the package, two issues were apparent: 1) it looked scratched up both on the front and back. I thought I had bought a new item! I did look at refurbished options, but decided to shell out the extra $$ for a new item. This one cost ~$300! 2) It was also missing the USB recharge cable. The box it came in said it should include the cable. It did include the souped-up cube, but without a cable, that isn't much help. I did try using other recharge cables from old ipods and ipads, but they don't work (of course). If the cable would have been included, I would have lived with a scratched up product. But without the cable, I refuse. The distributor (WorldWide Distributors) isn't a quality operation. Very frustrated. I'm returning the item for a refund."}

I looked for the charger, but there was not one in the box. I found my son's old charger, but you can't plug it in. I called amazon. After an hour on the phone my best option was a refund to my card, which will take 5 business days. I'm out $300, I have no ipad for my trip tomorrow, and I have to drop this off and return it.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "I bought this for my wife. She liked my iPad, and wanted one that she could bring to school to take notes with instead of bringing around her bulkier laptop, along with a ton of books (doctoral students get a lot of things to carry). I have the iPad Air 2, but I couldn't find my particular model in a price that I could afford at that time. When I went on Amazon, I found the Mini 2 at a very good price. I decided to buy it for her, and it came here a few days later. She's very pleased with it so far, though typing is a bit of a challenge even with a case with a keyboard. The difference in size makes typing naturally difficult, and is something I should've put more consideration into, especially because I personally have a hard time typing on my Air 2 - I tried typing on hers, and my fingers created a beautiful word salad (I have quite big hands).\n\nFor games she loves it, and she can access a lot of her textbooks very easily. That was a great benefit of buying the iPad - now she can rent a lot of her very expensive textbooks (the ones she doesn't want to keep) in a digital format and just tote along the tablet instead of a massive hardcover. Reduced her weight in her bag, and the tears in our eyes when we open our bank accounts after we purchased our books for the next semester. The screen is great - both of ours have the Retina display, and while I originally thought it was a massive gimmick and refused to shell out more money for it on my first MacBook Pro (Mid-2012), my newest MacBook (Mid-2016) definitely was going to have it. Also, I love the night mode, and use it on my tablet, Mac, and iPhone, as it really does help my eyes at night.\n\nFor reference, the iPad Mini 2 I purchased was the WIFI  32gb in silver."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "32GB's are not enough in this day and age, and Apple didn't make this tablet with expandable storage. It's ok for pre-school up to and including 2nd grade children who simply want to play games and delete them and download new ones. It doesn't really need the Face Time pre-installed on it though, considering the age level of child that it's suitable for. This amount of memory however is definitely not enough for a child older than that and certainly not adequate in any way shape or form for an adult. The operating system is nice, user friendly and functions very well, but the tablet itself is extremely over-priced for what you are getting. If Apple had given the buyer an option of adding an SD card of at least 128GB or more, then the tablet would have been adequate for adults as well as children and worth the buying price. A huge oversight on their part."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "First off and full disclosure...I'm a long time Apple hater.  I only bought the Mini 2 because I was having trouble with my Nvidia Shield K1 tablet when using it as a flight display for the DJI Mavic Pro.  I really don't know how Apple \"is all that\" to so many users as there products are supposedly easy to set up and operate.  In fact, the set up did go fairly smoothly but of course you have to have an iTunes account to get set up which is a drag.  Why the assumption I want music?  So once it was setup then I needed just TWO apps and both were Free.  Finding the App Store on iTunes is like looking for Where's Waldo?  Turns out Apple on iTunes doesn't really care about apps as they have hidden the link down below the fold, so to speak with a little ink.  Unlike Google that puts all these thinks together in a logical format.\n\nFor a FREE app there was a \"Get It\" click then a \"Install\" click.  Why would I want to get it and not install it?  Then there was a financial click.  No card need because this was FREE.  Then there was some sort of continue click.  Were there more clicks? I lost track.  Eventually, it did load.  I repeated the same process for the other FREE app.  Apparently, the Apple gods took mercy on my poor Android soul and then offered that I could now skip many of these steps in the future for FREE apps, if I wanted this option.  I did.\n\nFunction in flight.  It works better then the K1.  The K1 was great until either an OS upgrade or DJI Go 4 upgraded, not sure but the display would disconnect in flight.  Not critical to flight but still annoying.  The Mini 2 does not cut out, yeah.  However, it does drag. Dragging means as you pan with the onboard camera, the Mini 2 displayed picture stops panning (freezes might be a better description) for a second or two.  Not smooth or cool at all.  After about 15 minutes of flight time (or on the second flight after a battery) is when the screen begins to drag.  I don't know if this means the 2 is overheating or what.  Maybe I should have bought a Mini 4?\n\nAs a Apple hater, I do admit that the screen does look pretty dang good.(when it is not dragging).  BTW, it was sold to me as brand new and it did come in what appeared to be a new sealed Apple box with the original associated gadgets (ear phones and power adapter/charger).\n\n2 stars off because the display drags after only about 15 minutes of use and the software download experience is a stinker."}

My 3rd generation kindle fire still functions ok, but the processor is slow, and the apps are really limited in comparison to the IOS apps from apple. i have a apple iphone 5c so i figured i would just keep it.\n\nThis ipad features a retina display, and the display is absolutely gorgeous. i can watch netflix, amazon instant video, and movies i have stored in the cloud with ease.\n\nthis ipad has a very long battery life, i was able to get over 5 days of usage without charging. now, keep in mind that i turned off location services and kept it in airplane mode when not using online services. (like streaming netflix and checking facebook).\nall my photos sync from my phone to my ipad with ease. it's a neat feature of having two apple devices.\n\nIpad has a great feel to it. feels nice and solid. I invested in a 20.00 case that i purchased here on amazon. i decided to shy away from my beloved otterbox case. otterbox in recent years has gone down hill as far as quality. so i went with another brand it seems to be securely protecting my ipad.\n\nthis ipad has everything that the more expensive ipad air does, and costs far less. however the screen is smaller on this ipad than the ipad air. the screen size of the mini is sufficent for me. i like the size of the device and it's comfortable to hold in your hand.\n\nonly been using this for a few weeks, and so far i'm pretty happy. it's far superior to the kindle fire for sure. pick this up today, it's a good buy!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "I think I know my tablets: I previously owned the original iPad and the Kindle Fire, and now have an iPad Air, and my wife has an iPad Mini 4. So I have high standards and an easy way to compare them.\n\nI purchased the Mini 2 for only one reason: I fly a DJI drone that needs a phone or tablet to see where you're flying. My phone's screen was too small, my full sized iPad Air was too heavy, and my wife didn't want me to \"borrow\" her Mini 4.  I thought an 8\" tablet would be perfect, and I was right. The Mini 2's screen is beautiful and bright with Retina Resolution; with a small sunshade, it's perfect even in bright sunlight. The contrast is terrific and I can finally see even the finest details.  The processor is fast enough to handle the considerable workload and complexity of DJI Go software.  I was very happy about all that...but none of that surprised me.\n\nWhat did surprise me is how well the Mini 2 performs as a general use tablet. The screen is very slightly less vivid than the Mini 4, but equal or better than almost all other tablets, and has the same high resolution. The sound is about the same. The processor is snappy-- fast enough for everything (except possibly high end gaming). The  sensitive and quick. And it's so small and light that it can be used for hours without tiring  your arms. Apple has upgraded all the 2s to 32gb, so storage is ample.  (Don't be suckered into buying a refurbished model that's only 16gb.) At the Black Friday price I paid (not on Amazon) it has to be the bargain of the century.\n\nBottom line: Even though  the Mini 2 originally was released two years ago,  it is still a great tablet."}

Very intuitive.\n\nShe is not tech savvy, but most of the applications (apps) available for download are easy to use and free! (At least the apps she was interested in were free) - You do have to set up an account in order to buy apps.\n\nThe touch screen is fast, reactive, and quite neat. I recommend a screen protector and case to keep it safe.\n\nSecurity of the apps vary depending on the app. Do the research and read the reviews of each app you are interested in. I fully trust the banking and financial apps I use on my iPad.\n\nThe iCloud can fill up quickly depending on usage of the iPad and the apps you download.\n\nAll in all, a great little tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "My daughter wanted an iPad for Christmas and after doing some research I found this device. The price point was perfect being the previous years model. Apple did a great thing for the consumers (and not so much for themselves) when introducing the iPad Mini 3. There is practically no difference between the two (2 vs 3). Same size, same screen resolution, same memory, same processor, same camera. The 3 has the updated iOS and the finger print reader and the color gold, but for the most part the internals are identical. The price is now low if you can find one, you can get the 16gb version between 200 and 250. Great for kids and just the right size. I purchased a blue handled case from i-Blason for protection. Best deal on an Apple product I've ever made."}

The storage space is minimal, which I knew going into the purchase; however, the major disappointment has been performance, the internet in particular.  It is sluggish, incomparably sluggish.  Our iPhones are much faster, laptops are faster, the cheap google chromebook is much faster, when using the internet via the same wifi.  By comparison, the iPad mini loads slowly, often pauses; it is just slow.  I have a kindle fire that works better than this device.  Of all the various computing  devices we have owned, the iPad mini has been by far the worst performer in our experience."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "From the Retina display and the A7 processor chip compared to the original iPad minis A5 chip to the super easy finger glide screen and everything in between, this is a phenomenal product. I had the first iPad min for......way too long, so I started shopping for a new one. I always stay within the Apple product universe for tablets and phones (just not Mac's they confuse and scare me though they are quite amazing) and I love the size of the mini series, it's just perfect for a casual user like me. I was bouncing back and forth between the mini 2, 3 and 4 and I'm super happy and satisfied I ended up with the mini 2. The mini 3 is well, pretty pointless.....it has a finger scanner and.......and............a finger scanner........oh and I think it also comes in gold but.......to me it looks like buttcheeks. That's it otherwise is the exact same thing as the mini 2, in fact I looked on Apples website and they dint even offer the mini 3, openly at least it's not in the comparison list for all the iPad models. So after realizing the mini 3 was just a re-skin of mini 2, my choice came down between the mini 2 and 4. I'll admit the 4 was the better choice obviously, if you have that kind of money to just throw at a tablet, but mini 2 won because well it's cheaper for one and it alone is a tremendously colossal upgrade from the original mini. Going from the first mini to mini 2 is like going from a caveman stone wheel Flintstones car, to a NASA Space Rocket Ship. Yes it's just that good of an upgrade, and I image the jump from mini 2 to 4 is just time travel. If you have the money to shell out for the mini 4 by all means go for it, but if you're looking to save a lot of money and still get a mind blowing product then I'd suggest going with the iPad mini 2 but that's just me. Personally to me saving money is earning money and I'm passed the phase in my life where I absolutely need the latest and greatest piece of technology to survive. Going with something that may not be the very best but is still a great or even, in this case, a phenomenal product is just a more logical and smart way of thinking about things and you'll be happier overall because you still have change left over to buy something else or will give you an extra boost in saving up to get what you want later on. So my consensus is, iPad mini 2..........I love you.............original iPad mini...........I think we should see other people....."}

It is even still included in the sale lineup from Apple's website.  The 7.9 inch form factor is surprisingly large.  I wasn't sure it would be enough for me, but it doesn't feel cramped even a little bit. The speed of this device is great!  The A7 processor makes any task smooth as butter.  I previously owned the 1st generation iPad mini.  The retina display on the 2 looks absolutely amazing compared to the display on the first one.  The 2nd generation is also noticeably faster compared to the 1st.  Using this device to watch HD video, surf the web, play games, use on stage as a chord chart manager, etc. is so nice!

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "Technically, this is a good device.  Better that some, not as good as others.\n\nMy issue is the Apple software and oppressive security and the management of that security.  I own an Apple iPad mini and it still worked fine, until there was a glitch in one of the applications that caused the software security feature of the iPad mini to request the Apple userID and password.  Like most people, I rarely have the need to use the password and I got it wrong enough times that it locked my account.\n\nHere is where it got weird My Apple userID was an old email address that is no longer valid.  I could only get one of the security questions right (did not write them down when I first filled out the security stuff they put me through).  I contacted the Apple technical support and was told that because I could only get one (1) of the security questions right and it is required to get 2 out of 3 correct, there was nothing that they could do and my iPad Mini would never function again.  NOTHING THAT THEY COULD DO! and now I have an Apple paper-weight on my desk, because I could not remember enough information to satisfy their policies.  It is fair to say that the situation was caused by my negligence in not being able to comply with the Apple policies, but to turn my iPad into a paperweight is NOT equitable or justifiable punishment.  They could fix this, IF THEY WANTED TO!   Apple has chosen to NOT help.\n\nMy advice- purchases anything other than an Apple product.  While I understand the need for security and privacy, the Apple Company has placed the strict, zero-tolerance, administration of their policies over the needs of their customers and over common sense!  They have left me NO recourse in solving my problem, so I am making it my mission to let others know of pitfalls of dealing with an Orwellian like company.  Run away from this company and spend your money with anyone else!"}

It was really hard to tell from the listing whether this was a new unit complete with factory warranty (one year). When I called Amazon Customer Service (best customer service in the WORLD), I was assured that it was indeed a new unit with an Apple factory warranty in place. When I received the iPad mini 2, the first thing I did was register it on Apple's website, and it was there that I discovered that not only was one month of the warranty already used up, but that my telephone assistance for the unit had expired ..... So - what I was told was kind of true, but not completely true. It was less expensive than on Apple's own website, but not by much. Was the savings enough to warrant having lost a month of warranty, and telephone assistance? Can't answer that, really. Just hope I don't have any issues that would require telephone assistance! Other than that, I bought this unit to be able to access my son's iCloud, filled with pictures of the new baby, and also to be able to FaceTime the baby when she's old enough (very soon). It's the only Apple product we now own, apart from our iPods from years and years ago."}

It's got all the power and ability as the larger ones, just in a smaller size.\n\nIf you are reading this and you're not sure if you should get it because there are other, cheaper tablets out there (there are tons), then hear me out. I have wanted an Ipad for the longest time, but never bought one because I didn't have the money for it. When I did get the money for it, I was just going to buy another cheap tablet (I've had to buy several because cheap tablets don't last very long), but I decided to go for it. If you have the money, and you want an Ipad, then get an Ipad. This thing does not disappoint (for what I use it for).\n\nI basically use this tablet for everything, except for games, and primarily reading. For that purpose, this tablet does wonderful. The screen is very clear; if you are upgrading from a cheaper tablet, then the screen will probably blow your mind, and if you're transitioning from another, high-quality tablet, then its probably just gonna be \"meh\". The battery life on it is very good. I charged this to 100%, unplugged it, and watched an hour and  a half long movie. When the movie was over, the ipad was at 94%. Anddd, with the split screen option and the ability to watch the movie while you work, I was watching the movie, checking facebook, emailing people, and all sorts of things; needless to say, the processor and battery on this thing is impressive.\n\nI gave this four stars for two primary reasons - the wifi connectivity could be better (the the new kindle fire hd has an impressive dual-band whatcha ma call its), and I have found the page turn animation quite annoying while reading and I can't figure out how to turn it off.\n\nIf you want this ipad, and have the money, then get it, you aren't going to be disappointed. If you are looking for a tablet to watch a lot of movies on, this will do well, but you could also look at the kindle fire's which have an impressive screen quality for a low price. If you want web surfing, this does well. If you want a gaming tablet, I suggest you do more research (there are some by asus and other brands that have some impressive processors on board). And finally, for those of you who are photographers, the camera is alright, not the best thing ever; however, the photo editing apps are quite cool and may come in handy. All in all, this is a great tablet that will more than likely work for your needs."}

There are tons of free learning apps and games that can be added or remove at whim. So, I was able to easily download a variety of age-appropriate apps as learning tools for my son, and, now my daughter. The camera quality is awesome. No viruses. No functionality problems. I highly recommend purchasing an iGuy case with this, especially if buying for a young child who may frequently drop it. The case is spongy and super protective. My son's iPad is about 4 years old now and still running with no problems. It's small size makes it much easier to transport than a standard iPad and the screen is plenty large enough for easy use and viewing. It connects to Wi-Fi networks with ease and has a bluetooth function. Good parental controls on it via the password. Just don't forget the password or you'll be in trouble. Excellent value!"}

My final assessment was that it is definitely a useless product.\ni have microsoft product, that i replaced when the model became obsolete, not when it went dead, one fine day.\"\nI went ahead and bought microsoft surface pro 4... it is a magnificent product, that can be used as a reader and laptop..i suggest go for surface pro."}

Many people stated that it would be fine to purchase mini 2 if it was not important to have the the finger print technology, which was fine for me. The set up is the same entered my apple id etc. Once the ipad was set up, I was/am a happy camper.\nThe screen resolution is great the pictures are great, it's compact and not bulky at all.

I needed this gadget because it's rated to work best with another gadget I needed. Being a Windows/Android guy, now I can tell you why:\n\nCons:\n-It feels like it's going to snap in my hands. Nice and smooth? Yes. Sturdy? No way. I'm not going to test that theory.\n-No micro port. I mean, cmon.\n-I always felt that Android's add-supported apps were annoying, but a necessary evil. The app store's \"Freemium\" content is downright PTSD inducing and had me daydreaming about this thing meeting my friend Pietro Beretta.\n-A 5 megapixel camera? How groundbreaking. I know this thing came out in 2013 or so, but my old Samsung Galaxy S3 has an 8 megapixel camera, and it's a year older.\n-The marketing of SIRI is way better than the actual use of it.\n\nPros:\n-People think it, and by extension, you, are \"cool\", even though neither of you really are.\n-Battery life seems to be very good.\n-The camera has some cool features.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're a hipster who wants to look like you're doing something important, even though you don't even have your own wifi, this is the gadget for you. If you need to get some actual work done, get a Windows tablet. If you just need to communicate, navigate and update while you're mobile, get an Android tablet."}

Neither device was intuitive or kid-friendly. I finally went ahead and spent a bit more and got the iPad mini 2 and it was worth every penny. My daughter loves it - it's so much more user friendly than the other two tablets I tried out. Yes, it cost a bit more money, but it's worth it to see her using it effortlessly. When she had the Nabi she was constantly asking to borrow my iPad. I'm so glad I got the mini for her. Highly recommend!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "I really really love the iPad mini 2. BUT, you need to be aware that it is just like other Apple products. It doesn't support flash, which I have already had an issue with when trying to play sample audio files on a simple Spanish website. I really would like to be able to do something so stupidly simple, yet Apple, despite its tremendous resources, cannot find the willpower to fix this issue for the many iPad owners in the world. It's such an amazing product, yet has these tiny flaws that will eat a new owner alive. Furthermore, along this subject, you will often be groping in the dark for at least a little while to figure out how to accomplish certain tasks on the iPad. This actually doesn't mean that you cannot do almost everything, just that Apple does it differently. Enough time has passed that Apple has figured out how to incorporate MOST of the key features that ought to be included in any standard table. But there ARE holes in the system. Overall, I would say that you should be fine getting one, but be aware that tricky workarounds make it difficult to go to certain websites and use them properly. Codecademy apparently is available for use using a different browser than Safari, but you cannot use a keyboard for the time being. This is terribly frustrating, but not a dealbreaker. Overall, just be aware that iPads are better-suited as ENTERTAINMENT devices, not necessarily always for productivity purposes."}

His schools uses iPads for learning so I have been able to use the same apps with the teachers info to help him move along and go over his troubled areas. He went from having extreme difficulty trying to read and sound out words to being able to read on his own and sound out new words rather then trying to learn them all by sight.\n\nThis is also a great looking tablet and really the prefect size for just being an online or e reader as its not too big or too heavy. It appeared to be able to play any of the App Store games I could throw at it, and sounded pretty good too for only having one speaker. It also was capable of having iOS 9.1 put on it and was able to use all of the new multitasking features. The new iOS update also keeps the device speedy and did not slow it down.\n\nI would highly recommend this a an good and economic tablet for anyone or any family."}

After my son goes to bed at night, I use the iPad to watch Netflix and to surf the internet. Once I got used to not having a \"back\" button, I fell in love with the iPad. The screen is brilliant, it's FAST, and so reliable. Additionally, it charges quickly and the charge lasts ALL day. The battery time is more than DOUBLE any of our android devices. All 3 of my children intuitively figured out how to use this, and my son is getting the hang of the communication application. I may never purchase another android tablet."}

Connecting cellularly has been another story entirely and has been completely unsuccessful.  Long story short, I found out from a lengthy diagnostic visit to the T-Mobile store that I was sold a LOCKED model (used/refurbished that was probably never completely paid off by the previous owner).  So essentially the cellular function is completely useless.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!  Future purchasers, here's a heads up to be aware of potential locked units."}

I would recommend buying a Lifeproof case for it as I have had several friends drop thiers and break it. The case is a little high but worth the investment considering a screen repair will cost at least $100 hassle included."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "iPad Mini 2, Fantastic Product!\n\nThis product is perfect for anyone who is interested in something that could function like a laptop but is also lightweight and easy to carry around. Many people who would be satisfied with this product is children, students, and even professionals in the workforce.  I am a college student who constantly uses a laptop on a daily basis for school. After a couple of years I wanted something smaller to take notes and do homework on so I bought the iPad mini 2. I would have to honestly say that buying the iPad mini 2 was one if the best things I have done.\n\nAdvantages\n It is so lightweight and easy to carry it around in a backpack and even a purse. I measured the success on the product based on if it functions similarly to a laptop.\n It has full internet access and you can even download Microsoft office for free on it.\n It is very simple to take notes on and it allows you to physically draw on the notes, unlike laptops.\n It has a picture and video camera on both side of the iPad and a full touch screen keyboard.\n\nDisadvantages\n The only issue I had was choosing what memory size to get because Apple products have limited memory. I ended up choosing the 32g and it has been more than enough memory for all of my documents. You can also use iCloud to maximize your memory for the iPad.\n\nIf you are looking for something smaller and simpler than a laptop, this product is perfect for you! I was completely satisfied with the product I bought."}

If you're selling an item that won't be covered by the manufacturer and selling it as a new item, it should be stated as such in the description. I consider this false advertising. I was able to get a refund for this item, so I appreciate that but what a hassle to have to deal with it.

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "Wonderful and Awful. First lets look at hardware. On the good side, the screen is beautiful and the device feels good to use (when it works). On the bad side there is no way to upgrade memory, no SD card, no USB port, no way to replace the battery and it only will charge with apple (expensive) chargers (Seriously!!).\n\nOn the software side the iPad is OK if all you want to do is social media, youtube, email and web browsing. Don't be fooled into thinking that you can be productive and creative with this device. If you wan't that get a laptop. Apple has locked down the device and limited it so much that it is just a toy. This was very disappointing to me because the device has potential to be so much more. iOS was designed for phones and so the iPad feels more like a big smartphone than a small computer.\n\nGetting data onto and off of the iPad or getting apps to communicate with each other is a nightmare. Each app stores its own data and, unless the app has been explicitly programmed to export, there is no way to get at the data it creates. Each export feature works differently. There is no standardization between apps. Each different app requires half an hour of research and googling to discover how to export its data.\n\nGetting data onto the iPad must be done through iTunes and \"Synched\" onto the iPad. If you have two people in the house with different iOS devices then each person NEEDS their own computer. A single computer CANNOT be shared by two iOS devices. I bought a bunch of apps for my daughter's iPod. It was made obsolete by apple so she switched to an Android device. I would like to transfer those apps to my iPad. Can't be done. Those apps are locked away until my daughter gets herself another Apple device.\n\nI have also had two multi-hour troubleshooting sessions where my iPad did not behave properly in the past six months. When iOS 8.0 came out my WIFI broke until apple released an update (8.1). In the latest case my iPad would not Update Apps and would not download new Apps for two weeks. I tried many suggestions on internet forums including factory reset but nothing worked. Then it suddenly started working again. Given the price premium I expected a trouble free experience. My PC laptop is much more reliable and hassle free.\n\nI had expected that the iPad would be a small ultra-portable computer that I would be able to do real work on and be creative with. Instead it feels like a camera that can email and browse the web and do social media."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "My first piece of advice...Be very aware of from whom you are buying this tablet. I purchased NEW from my local BestBUY. My friend recently purchased from the AMAZON site but the tablet came from a reseller. She thought she was getting a brand new tablet,well it was not new but a refurbished tablet!\n\nRefurbished can be OK if that's what you paid for but if you bought new you should get NEW !\n\nIf you want a refurbished model ONLY buy from the apple store website as those are truly certified refurbished models with new casings, new batteries and 1 year warranties.\n\nNow for my review:\n\nI purchased my Ipad mini 2 to replace my aging Kindle HDX 7 inch. I also researched and tried ( at BESTBUY STORE ) the Samsung s 8.4 tablet.  The Ipad mini 2 is basically the same tablet as the mini 3 except for the finger print reader.\n\nI felt the Samsung and the Kindle had BETTER screens than the iPad mini 2 . However EVERYTHING else about the iPad mini 2  is better.\n\n* It seems faster,has few crashes and hang ups compared to my Kindle HDX. Stays connected to WIFI better than KINDLE HDX\n* More intuitive to set up and operate\n* Has way more available apps than KINDLE HDX or Samsung\n* Better overall build quality\n* Battery life is about 10 hours with moderate usage ( web surfing, game playing, downloading and listening to audio books )\n\nI have broken the screen twice on a KINDLE HDX . The charging port failed on my second one just after the warranty was over. I am done with Kindles!\n\nI read many reviews for the Samsung tablets and they seem to have a short life too.\n\nI have an old IPOD Touch 4 that's still going strong. I feel the extra money for an apple product is worth it over the long haul.\n\nIts your call but your spending a lot of money for any of these tablets. Do your research and buy carefully!"}

Amazon Prime Videos do play well & look great on the Bright Retina display.  Amazon Kindle books look good too.  But other than that, not very useful.  Maybe if you have some favorite Apps on iPhone, not available to Android, at least the iPad will allow you to run those apps on a bigger screen & that is very nice.  I bought it for $180 Amazon Price match from Best Buy.  I can't believe some people are STILL asking FULL RETAIL PRICE for years old technology?!?  Get a Kindle Fire or at worst the newest latest & greatest iPad mini.  MINI 2 is the Obsolete version, originally released November 12, 2013."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "There are very few reasons to purchase the iPad mini 3. Basically it is the exact same as the mini 2 but with a fingerprint sensor. So when I was in the market for an iPad mini for my son, getting a large-capacity iPad mini 2 made a lot more sense than purchasing a comparable 3. The processor is the same, the super sharp retina display is the same, the housing is the same, and the camera's the same.\n\nFor my iPhone the fingerprint sensor is very convenient for one-handed quick unlock. For the iPad I see less benefit for the fingerprint unlock, so it isn't worth an extra $100 for just this purpose.\n\nSo save money and get a great device and get an iPad mini 2."}

At first I wanted to return it due to some problems that the iPad may ask for a AT&T cell chip daily. I read it on Apple forums that it could be an issue. So I called Amazon and they said, to either cancel and return item or keep it the way it is. I was hesitant because I didn't know if I would have an issue with the AT&T chip even though I turned off the cell data in settings. Nevertheless, a month later, no issues have arose with the iPad asking me to insert an AT&T cell chip. I am happily using my iPad mini 2 with retina. It is a great product. Size is perfect.

I will easily give up the ability to \"mod\" or \"hack\" my devices in trade for them working right all the time.\n\nThe battery life is great. This model has the upgraded screen and it looks great. In my opinion, this is the right/best size for the iPad. The full size ones are basically the size of a thin laptop.\n\nI recently got a Surface 3 and it makes me miss the iPad more than anything else. Sure, it has full WIN 8.1 on it, but simple tasks such as editing a FB post are insanely tedious and needlessly difficult. Stuff like that is where idevices excel."}

The screen is beautifully clear and the processor makes it really fast as long as the internet can keep with it. The battery life is also adequate, it can be left on for a long time with out re-charging on standby or you can watch hours of movies/TV without recharging it. It responds well to touch and overall is just a great tablet."}

All your photos, documents, videos, passwords, bookmarks and even open tabs from other devices are all available everywhere. The more Apple software you use the more the device actually becomes secondary to doing and the experience of getting things done.\n\nCompared to other iPad models I actually had the air for about a year before switching to this little one. Typing isn't quite as easy on it but it's not that hard either. It's actually a bit easier to type when holding it in portrait mode.  I prefer the lighter weight and compact size since I have it with me constantly.\nAs for the LTE if you're on a budget I'd go for bigger storage capacity. Otherwise, the LTE is one of those things that is only occasionally useful but on those occasions I'm always really grateful I purchased it. Emailing from airports or long car rides or just having connectivity when you get to that hotel with no wifi. It's a lot more stable and convenient than tethering too."}

That's how I kind of envisioned when tablets were conceived in the first place. A product that one can hold comfortably with a single hand for extended periods of time, even when laying down. Its sleek, elegant, and in a way, looks even more premium than the larger version due to its size.\n\nThe screen is solid, not quite as sharp as a Macbook, Apple has managed to add on a retina screen for the 7.9 incher, so everything looks fantastic. The iPad mini can last me nearly 10 hours on a single charge; I usually keep the brightness on a medium to semi-generous level. The apps pull up without much of a delay and the internet connection is usually solid as long as my service isn't faltering.\n\nThe camera is very good, and videos look competent, though I opt to watch those on my laptop. If you have a student, especially one who demands a tablet along with a laptop (the product I'm reviewing is my father's), the iPad mini is ideal, but somewhat pricey."}

The mini size is PERFECT, especially for people who will be using this device recreationally and occasionally for professional tasks, because I personally don't think this is for people who are expecting it to completely replace their desktop or standard computers. I found it to be the perfect size for FaceTime, reading books, and to fit inside my purses/backpack. The display is incredible (I am also using a ballistic glass cover by TechArmor) and I have stable wifi connection at any place with public wifi. It never glitches or disconnects like I experience with my phone. I have not experienced any problems with the battery life -- it lasts me all day, and I would say I use it just as much as I use my phone. The cameras aren't incredible, but they're pretty good quality compared to the other tablets on the market. I also recommend the Yippee iPad cases here on Amazon -- way less expensive and every bit as good as the Apple SmartCovers."}

I got my daughter a mini iPad and then decided I needed one as well, because my old original iPad (first generation) cannot be updated and therefore cannot handle the vast majority of apps out there today.  Technological obsolescence -- something we must all contend with, whichever device is involved.  Anyway, the mini iPad is the perfect size for virtually everything I need to entertain myself with.  It has replaced my Kindle (also first generation), and I use it to play my Sonos system, surf the Internet, watch Amazon and Netflix, answer texts and everything else.  That said, I still use my MacBook Air for work and emails, but I so love my mini!  The screen is fantastic, the interface is seamless, it plays nicely with my other Apple devices, etc. etc.  It arrived super fast and well packaged.  Very very happy with this purchase.  PS  I opted for the version that is not the latest latest version based on research I did that suggested the upgrade was not really worth the extra $$$ for basic casual use, and I think that was the right choice.

It was a very accurate statement, it was an opened box, had all the peripherals, and the factory screen protector was still there ( although i think it had been removed at one point). The only blemish was two very small scratches on the back, to me that has no affect on my opinion of the device. When I purchased the Mini I had ordered the Lifeproof Nud case with flip cover as well, and so now my Mini will not be receiving anymore blemishes. First power-on of the Mini took me through the Apple start up/configuration procedures, and no one else's info or passcode was on it the Mini. I have been wanting an IPad Mini for sometime now and the slightly used wifi w/32gb model has filled that want for less than a new one."}

It looked in the box new, but when I brought it to the Apple Store to purchase an AppleCare warranty, I was told after the item had been scanned that it had had been previously purchased.  This meant that the full manufacturer's warranty for the Ipad had already started running, and I was told that there was only about 2-3 months left.  That was not what I wanted (I wanted brand new with full warranty), so I returned it."}

Well, even I already put LCD protection film on it, I tried to get support from Apple -  and other users already pointed out, the warranty is not valid.  With #2 issue, I contacted APPLE, and they said that \"We reviewed your request and, regrettably, are unable to update the purchase date of your iPad.  Apple warranties start on the date of the first retail purchase\".\n\n....

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "I LOVE my iPad mini.  I upgraded from the original iPad 1 and so the differences of these two devices are truly night and day.\nI remember when I first got my iPad 1, thinking it was so lightweight and portable and now it just seems so oversized and bulky.  However, that original iPad is still kicking!  If it weren't for the lack of updates and preventing from using a lot of the current apps AND the fact that I had a strip where I had messed up the pixels I probably owuld have been content to carry on with the original iPad.\n\nThe iPad mini is just truly a breath of fresh air.  I had contemplated getting a bigger screen, but really found that I didn't feel I needed a huge screen to perform the tasks I needed on a daily basis.  The iPad mini is truly so much easier to slide in your purse and use on the go.  The weight of this device is almost like carrying air.  It's just so easy and trust me I have this device in my hands almost every second of everyday.  It literally is glued to me at all times.\n\nThe camera isn't the BEST, but it's better than you'll find on similar devices like the Fire.  It's much clearer and crisper than what you would expect a tablet to have.\n\nI have the 16 GB and honestly, it was fine for awhile, however with how often iOS updates I would recommend never purchasing below 32 GB.  I had a 32 GB on my original iPad and still managed to run out of space (Don't even think of having movies stored on your devices each movie is at least 1 GB and that seriously is a huge chunk of storage space).\n\nThe screen is just so bright and clear.  I didn't think it could get better than the original ipad and man, technology just keeps making things better and better and better.  It's amazing the thigns you can see when you zoom in with your camera because of the high definition of the screen.\n\nI love the multitasking on the ipad.  Just everything about the iPad is top notch to me.  I purchased a Samsung Galaxy 3 7\" tablet last year and was so disappointed at how slow it was and how it just didn't perform well and was always crashing.\n\nThe iPad mini has crashed more often than I experienced in the early days of the iPad original, I'm not really sure why that is...  However, iOS is still a much more stable system than androids are.  I am so much more confident of my information being safe and secure than I am on any other operating system.  I just don't seem to have the same issues with iOS devices as I do with android or windows.\n\nIf you are wanting a tablet to use as your primary internet device, than I definitely recommend iOS and the iPads because they just truly peform better than anything out there.  Fire tablets are nice, but you are so limited as to what you can do on them and they just don't even come close to being on the same playing field as the iPad.\n\nThe ONE thing that I am not so crazy about is the charging cable that iPads use now.  I never had any issues with my cables on the iPad Original, the bigger charger just seemed to be more stable than the lightening one is.  I've gone through about 7 cords this year.  I don't know what the deal is with them."}

Because Apple renamed this iPad they can no longer sell the bath this one came from- that means a greatly discounted price for us consumers!\nThis is also the only way to buy the iPad mini 2 with a higher amount of storage space than Apple offers.\nThe iPad mini 2/iPad mini with retina is a great model, the only difference between it and the newest, iPad mini 3, is that it doesn't have the fingerprint reading button and corresponding chip. The processor chip is the same."}

This IPAD mini has a better display and faster, easier, internet access and I like the size better than the larger or smaller Kindle Fires.  Unfortunately it required 400mbs of download to work completely which wasn't practical at my rural home.  After updating at my city office it worked fine.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "I write this review to hopefully clear up some confusion and concerns some of you may have.  This has nothing to do with how wonderful the device is, but rather with its network capabilities.  I wanted a mini  that would work on T-Mobile's network.  But in looking at most of the ones for sale, I found that the best priced iPads were for use on AT & T's network.  I didn't want AT & T but did want the cheap price.\n\nI did a lot of research and was pretty sure that all that would be necessary was to replace the AT & T SIM card with one from T-Mobile.  Apparently the iPad's come unlocked from Apple even though they have a specific carrier's card in them from the factory.  So I gambled a little and bought one.  It came in the factory sealed box, so I knew it had never been messed with.\n\nAfter it arrived I went down to the T-Mobile store to get my new SIM card and sign up for data service...and to make sure that the iPad  would indeed work.  IT WORKED JUST FINE!!  So if you're on the fence about buying an iPad for use on different networks, it will work with these two carriers for sure.  If you want use it on a different network, then do your homework.  From what I found, Sprint could be a problem\n\nThis was done on the iPad mini 2, it should be even easier on the mini 3.  Here is something to keep in mind when trying to decide between the mini 2 and the mini 3.  With the exception of the fingerprint Id device on the home button, they are identical.  If at least a $100.00 in your pocket is worth more than the fingerprint id scanner, then buy the mini 2...I did and don't regret it at all."}
{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "The iPad Mini seems to work as advertised so far.  However, obtaining Apple Care for this item has been a challenge.  According to the local Apple store employees, this item is not a U.S. market item (I am in the U.S.), but instead is manufactured for an Asian (Japanese? Chinese?) market. The local Apple store refused to sell Apple Care coverage for it.  They suggested calling Apple to obtain Apple Care, although they believed I would not succeed.  On the first two calls, the Apple representatives repeated what the Apple Store had told us; that the mini was made for foreign markets and could only be supported by Apple Care in that country.  On the third call, the representative sold me Apple Care and was certain the iPad mini is now covered.  I hope this is actually true.  Both the Apple employees in the store and at the call center asserted that Amazon is not an authorized Apple retailer and I should have expected problems based on that fact.  I would suggest a different source for an iPad mini."}

It is speedy, responsive, and crisp. While the mini 2 lacks the touch ID innovation that was brought to the mini 3, I do not find that I miss this too much. The Retina screen is a big update and, I fear, that I fall into the class of people who are now dissatisfied with other screens. The biggest selling point to me is the form factor. Even though the new Air is thinner than this, the external dimensions just seem to feel better in my hands. If you're looking for the latest and greatest, go with the Air but if, like me, you're not using this for a lot of apps that benefit from the larger screen and you are attracted to the mini form, the mini 2 is a great buy (AT A REASONABLE PRICE, which this seller still has not offered) as it saves a little off of the newest mini without sacrificing much of the hardware that comes in the mini 3."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "*** Why last year's Mini 2 is better than this year's Mini 3 ***\n\nIf you're thinking about buying an iPad Mini, you should strongly consider buying last year's model (the 2013 iPad Mini 2, formerly called iPad Mini with Retina Display) instead of the iPad Mini 3 that came out in Fall 2014.\n\nThey are almost identical: EXACT same processor, EXACT same display, EXACT same battery life, EXACT same hardware and dimensions, and they run all the same apps EQUALLY well. The only thing you get with a 2014 Mini 3 that was not on the 2013 Mini 2 is the fingerprint sensor (and a new color option: white front with gold back).\n\nThis fingerprint sensor is the same one that's on the iPhone 5S and later models. It has limited usefulness on the iPad; it's more useful on phones, since more and more transactions will be done using phones instead of actual credit cards.\n\nSo, if the Mini 3 and the Mini 2 are virtually identical, why buy the 2? Because it's cheaper. Apple still sells the 2 for $100 less than a comparably configured 3. But you can save even more than $100 if you shop around, because many retailers are clearancing their inventory of last year's Mini 2. Two weeks ago, I found a Mini 2 with cellular and 64gb at B.B. for $150 less than a comparably configured Mini 3. I bought two--one for myself and one for a family member for Christmas. Unless you really want the fingerprint sensor or the new white/gold color combo, skip the Mini 3 and save yourself $100 or more by purchasing a Mini 2 instead.\n\n*** iPad Mini compared to iPad Air ***\n\nI bought an iPad Air when it came out in Fall 2013 and love it. It's extremely fast and the thin/light form factor is amazing, especially compared to earlier full-sized iPads. I know the 2014 iPad Air 2 is even better in some ways: a bit thinner, a faster processor, better cameras, and a new display that according to iLounge is slightly improved. But the 2013 iPad Air is so great that this is the first time I've not felt compelled to upgrade.\n\nThe iPad Mini 2 (formerly called \"iPad Mini with Retina Display\") came out last year about the same time as the iPad Air. Unlike the original iPad Mini from 2012, the 2013 Mini 2 is not a crippled iPad; it is virtually as powerful as the 2013 Air. It's essentially a 2013 iPad Air in a smaller package.\n\nWhile the Air is amazingly thin and light for a 10\" tablet, the Mini 2 is noticeably smaller and lighter, which makes it easier to hold in one hand for long periods of time and also much easier to travel with. There are times when the Air's larger screen is important--for example if I'm reading a textbook or a large-format magazine on the device, or editing a giant Excel spreadsheet. But most of the time, I'm equally happy with the Mini's 8\" Retina display. The Mini 2 runs processor-intensive games and apps virtually as well as the Air, which is to say very well indeed.\n\n*** iPad Mini compared to Android and Amazon tablets ***\n\nIt's true, you can get a 7\" or 8\" tablet for less money than an iPad Mini. Amazon's own 7\" Kindle Fire HDX is very good and much less expensive, as are some Android tablets.\n\nA good Android tablet can do most everything an iPad can do, or even more. While each operating system has its loyal fans, in fact Android and iOS are both very good and, at this point, very mature operating systems with a large catalog of apps. Android OS is much more customizable than Apple's iOS, which is important to many Android fans.\n\nI kind of don't recommend Amazon's own Fire tablets. They are essentially Android tablets with some of the Android features stripped away in order to keep Amazon content in front of the customer. If that doesn't bother you, Amazon Fire tables are very good and affordable, so they are worth your consideration.\n\nI am fortunate that I can afford to spend more to get the device I really want. And to me, it's worth paying more for Apple devices. I prefer iOS to Android and I like the hardware Apple uses and the build quality of iPads. But others prefer Android devices and I can't tell you my opinion is more valid than theirs.\n\nIf you decide to buy an iPad, you almost certainly will be happy with your purchase. iPads have a very high owner satisfaction rate and a very low defect rate. Apple customer service is absolutely excellent. The hardware and software are great. The only remaining decision you have is: which iPad?\n\nFor me, the iPad Mini 2 is the best choice for the reasons I gave above. It's very powerful and fast, the Retina display is great, the 8\" size is light and super convenient, and best of all it's much cheaper than the new Mini 3 despite being virtually the same."}

The only downside is that it uses more data than the iPhone. This is my first iPad so maybe they are all that way but if you have it on a network (not in a Wi-Fi area), expect to up your data plan.  I still love it, will never go without one now."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "I probably have a very unique perspective when it comes to electronic devices. First, I'm a major geek/nerd who has loved to learn about new things since I could hold an encyclopedia and reach a computer mouse. Secondly, I support technology for a living so I really hate fixing and/or configuring things for hours on end after getting home when I've supposedly left all that behind for the day. and thirdly, as a product reviewer I'm constantly seeing new devices and technologies and evaluating them to see if they are truly useful or just more junk. In truth though, in my deepest heart of hearts... I am...a GAMER.\n\nI have been gaming on the go off-and-on since I got a SEGA Game Gear. Since then I've tried a Nintendo DS, a PSP, and naturally, an iPod Touch and then iPhone. I'm here to say...if you like to game on the go with touch screen interface and a huge screen you have GOT to get one of these!\n\nNot Papa Bear or Baby Bear Sized, but Juuuuust Riiiiiiight...\n\nLet's face it. While the new iPhones have nice big screens the previous iPhones and iPod Touches were just too dang small if you wanted to play games on the go (especially if like me your eyes aren't so great). I looked at the iPad, and quickly determined that sucker is just too dang large to haul around and use at home (I'll save it for when I'm a senior citizen). But this device...this is perfect. The screen is crisp and clear with excellent contrast and color definition. It's small enough that blowing up iPod/iPhones games to full screen won't make your eyes bleed, and large enough to really do high-budget games justice.\n\nThin as a stick, powerful as a locomotive\n\nMy last iDevice was/is an iPhone 4. It's performance is dreadful all-around. Interface is sluggish, boot time is slow, games take forever to load (I could go on). This device is solid, amazingly thin and light, and INCREDIBLY fast compared to that phone. Infinity Blade III loads in seconds, not in a minute, and looks even better than it did before. The sound is better than my iPhone. The boot time is faster. The interface is amazingly fast and fluid. The wi-fi connection is easily 5 times faster than it was on my iPhones and it doesn't lose its signal. I'm in love, I'm in love!\n\nBusiness as Usual\n\nAll the business/finance apps that I had on my iPhone are available on this device, they just work better because they have been redesigned for the larger screen. And since the on-screen keyboard is much larger, it's much easier to put in passwords correctly. More information is displayed onscreen at once in mail, and apps like MINT and Amazon are much easier to use because you can view more information at once rather than constantly hitting the back button.\n\nThe name of the Game is the Game\n\nSeriously, I got this device primarily to use as a portable game system? Yes I did. And it was a rather unselfish thing to do. You see, I like to unwind after a long day of work by playing some Hearthstone, checking one or two game Websites, and catching up on my email/buying a few small items on Amazon. For the longest time, I've been doing this on my desktop while my wife chills watching Steaming TV and playing with her laptop/tablet. No more! Now, I can finally sit NEXT to my wife and play Hearthstone while sitting close enough to get my wife a hug between turns! THAT'S the real reason I got this device. When you need to play a good game (and take care of a few after-hours business things) and still be sociable this is the answer.\n\nAs for the games? I get crazy looks from some people when they see what I'm playing on this device. While everyone else is playing Angry Birds, I'm playing the Infinity Blade Trilogy, Dragon's Lair Trilogy, Dodonpachi, Espgaluda, and of course Hearthstone. These are games with absolutely amazing graphics and gameplay, real showcases for what gaming can be like on this device. And I'm just getting started. I've got a 64GB device with iOS 8 installed so I'll be buying lots for shoot-em-ups, Strategy Games, and board/card games in the future. I still have 50GB of space left, and once I start Cloud-syncing my writing projects to my wife's Macbook, my Windows 7 Desktop, and this device, I'll be able to proof-read and edit the same projects from everywhere.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nPrevious generations may have been low-res, low-capacity, slow, and expensive, but that's a thing of the past. This sucker is lightning fast, high-res, high-capacity and ready to play. I got mine for $350.00 and for a planned 10 year investment that's a steal. Now is the time for doubters and haters to give Apple Devices another try. If you would like to make your electronic evenings more casual (and dare I say it, magical?) you pretty much can't go wrong with this device. 5 stars. High praise for an Apple Device coming from me (I gave the iPhone 4 one star)."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "I absolutely love it. It's basically like a big iPhone without the calling feature (at least for me). I've had my iPhone for a little over a year and it's been holding up great, but sometimes I worry I use it too much as a computer and not as a phone. So I wanted something to take the pressure off. The iPad mini 2 has been great. I already knew how to use it and everything. I mostly surf the net and watch stuff that streams (like Hulu and Netflix), so for me 16 gigs is sufficient. The screen is absolutely amazing. If I start to run out of room I usually just offload my pictures. I've been able to put a lot of apps on it and save room on my iPhone; it's been great. Sure, I wish there was more memory, but hey if you can only afford the 16, you're still getting a great deal. I highly recommend it; especially now that the iPad mini 3 just came out. The 3 has only got one small new feature; other than that it's exactly the same as the 2. So the prices will be lower on the 2 now and a lot of people will be selling theirs. I highly recommend it; now is the time to buy it!"}

If you load a few apps, a few songs, a few photos, you will find you have almost none.  They tell you that's fine, because things are stored in the Cloud, but if you're offline...\nMost importantly, however, you should know that this device is the least user-friendly thing I've ever encountered, and I've worked with a variety of computers for more than 30 years.  It's 'mindset' is so unlike a computer that everything seems counterintuitive.  I found the coordination between my iMac and the iPad to be very cumbersome.  You have to have updated your computer to Yosemite and your iTunes to version 12.  My iMac is less than 3 years old, but if yours is pre-2012, you will not be able to use Hand-off or Airdrop, 2 of their touted means of sharing.  If you don't read the manual, you're lost; luckily, you can download it (using up more memory).  For the past three months I've been on the phone to tech support more times than I can count; sometimes the person knows the answers, sometimes not, and occasionally they'll just tell you something that's just not true.\nYes, it's small, and yes, many things work well.  I bought it to travel, though, and the maps program is a joke, and so far I haven't found another that works well enough to use if you don't have an expensive cellular plan.  If I'd known, I'd have bought the 32GB or better yet a small laptop."}

It works everywhere in your country and where there is no wifi available\n2: most wifi networks detected are password secured so cellular is the way to go\n3. Great for traveling around the country and other places\n4. Gives you more online flexibility.\n\nCons:\n1. Monthly data fee depending on how much you use(but it might be worth it though)\n2. More expensive than wifi only models\n3. If you buy directly from a carrier store it might be locked to that carrier and unlocking can be a difficult process, so when you want to travel depends if you have roaming available and how much roaming will cost you.( roaming tends to be expensive depending on the carrier)\n\nAll in all a wifi only iPad might be a safer option if you feel you don't need a cellular data plan."}

The iPad was fast, responsive and had a beautiful display. I am normally a Kindle user but purchased this iPad mainly for work applications because of the size. The 7 inch Kindles were a little too small and the 8.9 was a little too large to carry in my purse when traveling. This iPad was just the right size. I have an iPhone so the operating system was familiar.\n\nI like the sleek size and easy set-up for email and other apps which is the case across the Apple platform. The battery power is decent and I can use the iPad off and on throughout the day and recharge at night. It was easy to find covers and accessories because it is a popular device. I pretty much liked everything about it prior to the IOS 8 upgrade. It suddenly became a LOT slower when using it on a Wifi network with speeds that are typically in the 80 - 100 Mbps download range. Now it frequently hangs up after beginning to load a page and will not go further. It often gives a message that it cannot connect to the server. When I access the same page alongside  it in my Kindle HD, the pages load instantly without any issue. I have been comparing the two tablets for a few days and even this older Kindle leaves the iPad in the dust. I've tried various fixes from the Apple support site with no resolution to this problem. The only thing that seems to help us to turn off the iPad and restart, or sometimes putting it to sleep and restarting helps.  The new IOS has some nice features such as the new keyboard but that doesn't make up for the unresponsiveness.\n\nI have decided not to update my iPhone to this new OS until the problems are resolved. Checking on different forums, I see that there are many other unhappy Apple users. Actually, this may be the push I need to look at other types of phones since my 2 year contract is up."}

But, after installing ios 8, the touch screen is often difficult to use. I have to press the keyboard keys, for example, only in the lower left corner of each key, and I have to press space bar several times. Some buttons work as usual, and some have to be pressed a dozen times. It was NOT that way when it first arrived. I had the Apple Store replace it, and the same thing happened again."}

Recent Amazon gift certificates from my sons provided the opportunity to purchase this Apple Ipad Mini Retina.  The Ipad Mini Retina provides everything I need in a smaller package.  I had to buy some of my Android tablet apps in the App store, but the cost was minimal and the the Apple version of the apps seem more stable.  My music was easily imported for use on the Ipad.  Some of the points I really like include FaceTime, Hangouts for Ipad, Google Chrome for Ipad, Ipad messaging , Dish for Ipad, Nascar apps for Ipad, the  screen resolution of the Ipad Retina, the battery life when watching movies or listening to music, and the overall tablet build quality.\n\nI still have an Android phone and tablet so I haven't complete drunk the pitcher of Kool Aid :) ....but I am very happy with this purchase and the service from the seller Vius.

I received the iPad within 3 days, brand new, in shrink wrap, perfect. One issue, and this is amazon itself, could definitely use some bumper packaging in the box. The iPad was in an amazon box and was banging around in there. *I am very particular about stability of electronics* A couple of cardboard bumpers would be great. I ordered from Tech Giant, and they were fantastic. Processed quickly, the iPad, as I stated, was brand new. Not a refurb, not a prior owner, and had 12 months applecare. I love the iPad, it is a beauty. I've used iPod touches for the past 7 or so years, and this is like night and day. The retina screen is fabulous. That and the faster processor make the extra $ worth it for me. I can't think of anything bad to say about this product. I'm smitten with it and cannot put it down. I definitely advise having a good case when you order, so it's not unprotected during use at all. Hope this was helpful. :)"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "I finally broke down and bought the IPad mini with retina display.  I found a great deal on Amazon from an outside seller who was selling one they hardly ever used.  The price was so low that I couldn't resist.  It is my first experience with an IPad and I was curious.  I have the Samsung Tab S, the Tab Pro, and the Galaxy Tab 4 and I love them.  I have been using the Samsung phones and tablets since they first came out.  I am a big fan of android so I was a little apprehensive about using the Apple OS.  My IPad arrived in 2 days and is in pristine condition, in the original box with the original charger.  I really think I got an excellent deal from an excellent seller.  I was impressed with the fact that the seller put up photos of the IPad so I could actually see it before buying it.  I've been using it for a few days now and feel that I can give an objective review.  The initial set up took longer than setting up the Samsung tablets, but it was not difficult.  The retina display is very nice, but not as sharp as the Amoled display on the Tab S.  The IPad is quite a bit slower than the Samsung tablets.  The app store is not as good as the play store.  Installing apps is much slower and having to enter my password every time I open an app is a big pain in the neck.  Another huge difference is that there is no back button on the IPad and I really miss it!  Manuevering around the IPad with no back button is clumsy and frustrating.  Searching on the Web also takes longer than with android.  I think that the IPad is in so many ways out dated.  The build quality, although nice, I think the metal back will easily scratch, and it is much heavier than the Samsung tablets.  The screen of the IPad picks up finger prints and smudges much more than the Samsung.  The feel of the IPad is slippery and harder to grip too, whereas the grip of the Samsung tabs, although plastic, is much better.  All in all I like the Samsung tabs better.  They offer many more qualities than the IPad mini.  Their technology is much better and they are smarter and easier to use.  I was also disappointed in Siri, it seems that no matter what I asked, it could not answer, I prefer asking Google!  The battery life on both the IPad and Samsung is about the same, the IPad lasted just a bit longer, and charging was slower on the IPad by about an hour.  The Samsung take about 3 hours to charge fully and the IPad takes about 4 to 41/2 hours.  I am glad that I bought the IPad mini to experience it, and I now know how happy I am with my Samsung tablets.  So in conclusion, I recommend the IPad mini with retina display hesitantly.  For those who love Apple they will probably like it and for those who have not experienced the IPad I would recommend the Samsung tablets."}

For those of you thinking you'll be able to get some work done using page, numbers or keynote, think again because those programs are very limited in their capabilities. Anyone who uses those programs and thinks they work great obviously hasn't done any real type of work in office products in their lives. If you are looking for an actual productivity device I would recommend the Microsoft Surface Pro instead. When I was looking at one of those at Best Buy the other day I was completely blown away and the capabilities of the device. It may not have all the apps, but who cares?

Plus, I got a great deal at B*st B*y and that was all it took to convince me to purchase this iPad mini.\n\nI selected the iPad mini version this time because I felt that the smaller size would be nice, and with the retina display I knew that the display quality would be excellent. It is also quite a bit less expensive (than the full size iPad) and for an impulse buy, that helps.\n\nBriefly stated this is a superb small tablet. If you are already invested in the Apple ecosystem then the apps you already own will load right up and it operates identically to your other devices. I'm not going to try to make the case for the Apple devices vs. Android tablets. I think they are both good, and both have their advantages and disadvantages. I've been using an iPhone for several years, as well as the larger iPad, so staying with Apple is a big advantage for me. That is what they want, of course, but it is also fine with me because I love the products.\n\nPros:\n\n- The size and weight of this device is wonderful - this iPad mini is less than 50% of the weight of my full size iPad, which is a huge difference. The difference in weight is enough to make it much more comfortable to hold for any extended period.\n- The display is still large enough to web surf and read documents comfortably. It has the same display resolution as my full size iPad (2048-by-1536), with a higher 326 pixels per inch pixel density than the larger model. In other words, the two displays will show the same identical content, the mini simply a smaller version. The display is just crystal clear and sharp.\n- It comes with a charger and USB cable, which are all you need to get started.\n- It's compatible with all other Apple iPhone, iPod, iPad apps, works seamlessly with my iMac computer, and is easy to set up right out of the box.\n\nCons:\n\n- the smaller display is of course slightly less suitable, compared to the full size iPad, for doing some things such as watching video. The speakers are also smaller and do not project the same volume of sound as the larger iPad.\n- as with all Apple products, not cheap\n\nComments:\n\n- The 16GB size is the most affordable and is what I selected. It does mean that you are limited in what can be loaded on to the iPad. Many users, those who have large numbers of apps or keep many photos or music or video files on their device, will want the 32GB or even 64GB sizes. My needs are more modest. I use it more for streaming and web surfing, and other less memory intensive applications. The 16GB is therefore very sufficient for me, but it is at the low extreme for devices of this type today. I realize and accept that it may eventually limit me in what I can do with the device, that it means less ability to grow and for future needs.\n- Physically, this iPad mini is just slightly larger than Amazon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Kindle-Fire-HDX-7-HDX-Display/dp/B00BWYQ9YE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Kindle Fire HDX 7\", HDX Display</a>. The iPad display is somewhat larger than the 1920x1200 pixel Kindle display. The iPad is about half an inch taller, quarter of an inch wider, and is slightly thinner. They are just about the same weight. The iPad mini was just fifty dollars more expensive than the Kindle at the sale price I paid. The Kindle HDX would have been my alternate choice - I like Amazon's Kindle products, but again there is the issue of app compatibility with other iOS devices I already own. And the iPad works just fine in reading the books that I have in my Kindle library, using the Kindle app that I have installed.\n\nThis is the wi-fi only version. My needs are only for a device for use at home and I have no desire or need to use this away from wi-fi networks or on my phone data plan.\n\nWhen the iPad mini was first introduced, my wife and I looked at one at the Apple store, and we had mixed feelings about whether or not we'd want the smaller size. And that was the original mini, before it had the retina display. Now that the mini has the retina display, and I have one myself and I've used it for several weeks, I'm not at all dissatisfied with the size. In fact, it has become the iPad that I use every day, while my wife continues to use the larger iPad (which she does prefer, but she also has not had much opportunity to use the mini because I've pretty much monopolized it). For a two-iPad family I think that having one of each size is a good way to go.\n\nFor my purposes this is perfect."}

Performance is smooth, pictures are crisp, and the battery lasts longer than almost any other tablet you can buy. What makes this product even better is that it's backed by Apple. Apple is one of the easiest companies to work with, and if something goes wrong with your device, they will usually spend no time in helping you get a replacement. I dropped mine a few weeks after I bought it, and I called Apple, and they gave me a new one under the warranty no questions asked.\n\nOverall great experience."}

The retina is pretty but to me its unnecessary; i thought the resolution on my iPad 2 looked just fine.  The newer processer in the mini with retina is what really impresses me.  I didn't realize that i had gotten accustomed to waiting a few seconds for apps to open and again while switching between them.  This new iPad mini doesn't have any of that \"lag\" i experienced with the iPad 2.  It switches between apps seamlessly and quickly.  It also has impressive battery life, i can start the week with it fully charged, watch netflix on my breaks and lunches at work and i will usually run out of juice about the end of the day thursday.  And i use it throughout the day to check emails, online banking, send iMessages etc.  Also, despite some reservations i had at first about the smaller screen size, the clarity more than makes up for it and it is the perfect size for holding in one hand.  I'll never go back to a full sized iPad."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "I bought this white iPad mini retina from Target and they gave me a $25 target gift card, what a deal for $399.\n\nFirst of all, this ipad is the perfect size. It's not too big like regular iPad Air and it has very similar performance. You cannot even see the technical difference, unless if you purposely try to benchmark and compare between the two. The graphic quality is a slight improvement from previous ipad mini, but not so noticeable like the new iPad Air. Meh... it's still not really a big deal to me. Apple has been always expensive from the beginning of time, but the quality and apps compatibility is no match against other competitor. So, yeah it's worth it.\n\nPros:\n- Light and thin size.\n- A7 core processor. Faster processor compare to previous iPad mini.\n- 16 GB hard drive. Big enough to put 3 full length DVD format movies onto it.\n- Better camera resolution front and back.\n- I love Facetime better than Skype and you can use either one with this iPad mini.\n- More cover and bluetooth keyboard now available. Check out Anker products on Amazon or ianker.com\n- iMessage can send text, picture and video message to all iOS owner such as another iPad or iPhone.\n\nCons:\n- Costly for 16 GB.\n- Screen resolution is not as good as the older brother, iPad Air. Although it is better than previous generation of iPad Mini."}

I am not super proficient with Mac products - I'm really an Android girl....  but... I am kind of annoyed at having to use the central button to close things and its a little clunky to switch between applications.  I bought it to use both for entertainment as well as for work.  I'm planning on using it for taking classroom observation data, notes etc.  The display is beautiful, it is very lightweight and the battery (with light to moderate use) lasts for several days.  I've really only had to charge it twice BUT I haven't used it to watch videos or download TV shows yet....  I like the smaller size, it is easier to carry - just a little larger than my Kindle Paper.  I foresee using it much more in the future as I find more productivity apps and possibly some magazine subscriptions."}

I read a ton and have been finding myself squinting in bed to read off the iPhone and noticed I have been getting awful headaches. I sucked it up and ordered the 32GB with 4g network in case I ever do need it. I went back and forth between the prices and capacity for about 2 weeks and decided the bigger would be better for the long run. I plan on using it for awhile and I have a ton of investing apps which I use daily.\n\nAs for the iPad mini, the picture is stunning. We already have an iPad 3 which basically my 2 yr old took over but I did a comparison between the two and the response time and picture quality is flawless. I am used to the iPhone 5S resolution and I could ask for more. If you are stuck between the old verisimilitude iPad mini for the simply fact of cost, don't waste your time. The response rate when opening applications along with the resolution and sharpness is hands down worth the extra money.\n\nTo make sure this stays clean and protected, I paired this with a Kavaj leather iPad mini case. It is beautiful, sophisticated and professional for my work related business trips."}

I already own a Google Nexus 7 tablet and was pretty happy with it, but developers of aviation apps have been slow to write apps for Android. Since I'm an instructor and most of my students use Ipads, I decided to get one so I could teach students how to use the aviation apps.\n\nSURPRISE! I should have done more homework...the wifi only version doesn't include a GPS! It doesn't say that in the text. So, to use my Ipad in the car or cockpit, I had to spend $90 on a DUAL XGPS150 bluetooth GPS and always carry it along. All of the Google Nexus 7's include the GPS. Lame.\n\nAlso surprising: It's heavier, bigger, and costs over twice as much as the Google Nexus 7. The Ipad may be \"mini,\" but it doesn't fit in the hand for reading as nicely as the Nexus 7. End result is, I'll continue to use the Nexus 7 for everything at home, and lug this sucker to the airplane with the external GPS for aviation. I feel like I wasted a lot of money on an inferior product. If I could do it over again (no returns if opened), I'd have gotten the 4G version for $175 more....but of course, the product description would have needed to tell me this one doesn't have GPS, which it didn't.\n\nOverall, I'm very disappointed. Show me the value here...there is none. Don't pay the Apple Premium!"}

So I got the mini (132gb) --- and love it!  The clarity of the screen is wonderful and it is indeed perfect for videos.  Moreover, I discovered that I like it better than the ipad for attending meetings and taking notes.\nIf I didn't have an ipad I probably would have gone for the current ipad 4(?) with a larger memory and retina display as the prices are comparable to the mini.  But having both is a lovely luxury.\nP.S. I also had enough credit card \"points\" to pay for more than 2/3 the price --- which helped make the decision."}

The faster processor is so obvious over the iPad 2. About the only disadvantage it has is when I use Paper (by 53), drawing with your finger isn't as fine as on the larger screen of the iPad 2.\n\nI think Apple is struggling these days, particularly with its software and decision making, but if you still prefer Apple to Windows or Android, then the iPad Mini with Retina Display is a fantastic choice."}

I purchased the 64 GB WiFi version for traveling on business, when I do not want to carry the larger one. I have the Personal Hotspot feature on my phone, so I did not need the cellular version of the Mini.\n\nAfter using it for a week, the screen is big enough and the text is clear enough for every day use like taking notes at work, surfing web sites, checking email and watching the occasional video.  The words on the Mini's retina display are a little small in some situations, but not so small that I cannot read them.  I also use multiple apps for viewing security cameras, controlling my alarm, thermostats and electrical outlets at my house. The iPad mini is the perfect size for carrying and I am able to use all of my paid apps on the new device at no additional charge.\n\nI will keep the iPad Air for my living room to control my home theater (DirecTV, HBOGo, MAXGo and Apple TV) and possibly for reading in bed at night.  However, I find I am using he iPad mini for just about every thing else. I have not gone on a business trip yet, but I know it will work just fine on the airplane while reading and watching movies.\n\nAfter reading some of the negative reviews for the seller, I was concerned about shipping an iPad in a flat rate envelope.  I emailed the seller and he assured me it would arrive in good shape.  My iPad mini arrived quickly and it was double bagged in air-filled plastic with Styrofoam peanuts between the two bags.  The outside envelope was roughed up and the Apple box had a tiny dent in one corner, but the item was in perfect condition. In the end, I saved a little bit on the price, plus I did not have to pay the sales tax which would have been close to $50 for my state."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "From where I stand, or sit, if you can get by the price of this 'cool standard', it's exactly what works for me because 1) the Mini comfortably fits in my palm, 2) the black model doesn't show dirt, 3) retina screen is out-of-control sharp and absolutely worth the extra 'blah-blah' than the original non-retina Mini; 4) AT&T flexibility for worldwide connectivity if I ever need it; 5) can use it as 'wifi only' without adding any plan until I need mobile/cellular (tomto/tomato) service and 6) with camera and video resolutions becoming greater and greater and as we have more photo, video and audio tools/apps at our disposal comes the need for more storage, hence the larger 64GB drive on this model, which will fill up quicker than you might think. So, yes the price jumps up quickly from the 16GB entry wifi-only model. But it is a Grand Slam of technology coupled with power, portability and fun (iTunes the App Store and more). A final note: This device should not be considered a laptop replacement. Most tablets don't come close. iPads (and most tablets) do not have any ports to plug things in such as drives, monitors, printers, keyboards, mice, optical drives, etc. Further, there is no file browser and it goes deeper. Yes there is Bluetooth connectivity that allows device daisy chains but then we start creatively architecting when all you really want is easy plug-and-play. So please consider your needs and usage carefully when you choose your tools :)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "Awsome tablet, a bit pricey but great. I changed my galaxy tab 3 8 inch for this one, and will not say the tab 3 is a bad choice but the ipad mini retina is a superior tablet, the build quality is amazing! The look and design are flawless, The speed is also excellent and of course the screen resolution is where the money is. The rear camera takes excellent  pictures just as good as the iphone 5 i belive, and the front facing camera also has good resolution. In terms of Apps, i believe the Apple apps seem to be a bit better designed than android's, but android does have its perks. For example i miss the utorrent app!, also android's openness and the huge customization options it offers. But again i tell you this ipad mini with retina display is an incredible device, and i guaranteed you will not be disapointed with it. I watch movies in it mostly on netflix, they look great, i also do all of my social media, web surfing  and emailing with no trouble. One of the things that got me to buy this ipad, where the excellent free apps tha come with it, it comes with: imovie, iphoto, garageband, keynote, numbers, and pages and they are all amazing apps, and i believe they are all worth about 45$, so it's a great value, specially if you are like me, who makes music all the time and edit videos also from time to time. So if you can afford it, you won't regret buying this ipad, it's almost perfect. If not the galaxy tab 3 (but the 8 inch version) is a great choice for the money and the galaxy note i believe is also great."}

My only \"issue\" so far has been the fact that my Survivor case for my original mini did NOT fit the new retina mini.

I saw today at BEST BUY that the Survivor case has been modified so that it will fit both the original mini AND the retina mini."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "Overall, I'm definitely satisfied, it's a great product, it looks great, feels great, and generally works fantastic.\nThere is a problem with it crashing though, it tends to crash about every other day, but it could be worse, it takes a decently short time to reboot and none of the apps are closed or altered when it returns to normal.  For me it's not too big of a problem given I mostly use it for games and some productivity and it only goes down for about 45 seconds.  I also think it is more of a problem with iOS 7 because on my iPhone it crashes about as often, so once Apple comes out with another update for the OS, the problem should be fixed, I hope.  So far (about 2-3 weeks) I have had no other problems with the device, even with putting it through graphics and CPU intensive tasks.  It is very fast and as long as the crashing issue isn't a problem for you it's definitely worth the money, especially if your already engrossed in the Apple ecosystem."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "My wife had a iPhone 4S and 3S before that for the last couple of years.  The iPhone screen was just getting too small to read and play games without her glasses.  The larger size iPad wasn't as easy to handle with one hand.  The mini is the perfect size to hold firmly with one hand.  The screen size is perfect for her to use without glasses.  The 128GB size makes it easier to put everything we have (movies, pictures, music, apps) on one device (if they had a 256GB or 500GB i would of purchased that).\n\nWe have the version without AT&T cell coverage.  I have tethering on my iPhone 4S and we use this when we are not using home WiFi.  I was also able to connect the iPad to my Acura MDX Bluetooth audio streaming feature to play music.  Sound from videos also plays using the in-car streaming Bluetooth audio; but, the sound from the car speakers and image on the iPad are not in sync'd by 1/2 second.\n\nWhat is really nice is I like to take photos with my Nikon camera and I have a WiFi SD card installed in the camera.  I can connect and download directly to the iPad the photos or movies and view right away instead of waiting until I get back home later.  It is nice to make on the fly adjustments and delete so-so photos to save space on card (shoot in RAW+JPeg).\n\nI am glad I waited for this version and I am expecting a lot of years of use (until the +256GB versions come out)."}

My husband likes buying gadgets and in the last 18 months we went through as many tablets, but we liked none of them. Finally, he gave up and bought me an iPad mini 2, and we both LOVE LOVE LOVE it! Only regret is we should have bought a 32GB or 64GB model, maybe with cellular, but we only had limited funds. Will be saving up for a higher model and let the kids have this one. The iPad mini is just so much better than everything else. Sorry, Amazon! I love Amazon but even the latest Kindle fire is UGLY and very difficult to use. All Android tablets are boring and susceptible to viruses.  The iPad mini gives a consistent experience. I just wish the App Store had a grid listing view like on Windows 8. Other than that my iPad mini connects to WiFi every time and maximizes the speed, unlike the other tablets. The screen is totally the best! I play Amazon videos and they've never looked better.

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "First off this is my very first Apple product, except a first gen iPod nano. I got the iPad mini because I needed a device to be used for school work. I needed something portable, great battery life, and functional. I was going to get another laptop after mine took a coffee bath but decided to go with the iPad mini because I was able to get it through AT&T for only $20 a month so I didn't have to shell out a huge chunk of change. And I get have internet pretty much everywhere I go and don't have to worry about connecting to wifi just to do some web browsing.\nThe iPad mini works great for me because I have a lot of down time between shifts at work. My shifts are only about two hours, but I'll have 3 or 4 shifts a day and sometimes 30 minutes to an hour downtime between each so I get to cram in school work between. It's super portable, I just throw it in my backpack and because of the battery life I just leave the charge cable at home. No ned to lug around a clunky laptop.\nWith a keyboard this really has replaced my laptop, there is some trade offs. I don't have a mouse and getting used to apple software and its limitations. But for youtubing, writing and web browsing it is great.\nI don't like the App Store, I feel the apps on there are trying to nickel and dime you for every last penny. You really need to watch what you buy and make sure it is what you are paying for. The first night I had it I paid 5 bucks for a word processor (silly me) that I thought was Microsoft word it turned out to be just a bunch of tutorial videos. The games are even worse, the free to play games want you to pay for everything. There are good games and apps but its hard to find them because of all the crap in the App Store. There are thousands of bad apps for every good one.  I would give this a 5 star if the App Store wasn't so crappy, apple needs better content curation.\nDespite the App Store and the software limitations I was able to accept a few trade offs for the great battery life and portability."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00GQDCE72", "review": "Actually, I liked this tablet better than I thought I would. However, as you will see below I have some major gripes with the price/features combination for this model. Lately I have been seriously thinking about upgrading my iPad 3. Tried the new Samsung Tab 10.1 (2014), iPad Air, and this Mini. Neither one of those larger tables really tempted me to give up on my iPad 3. Yes, they were a bit better in this and in that, but eventually neither one felt twice as good as my iPad 3 to justify their price (I figured that I would have to double the $280 or so that would get after selling my iPad 3).\n\niPad Mini retina did feel like a major upgrade in terms of size and weight. In fact, it is a better value in terms of size/weight vs screen size against iPad 3: you are dropping 50% of the weight and only losing 33% of the screen real estate (and nothing in resolution, of course). Surprisingly, most of the time I did not even feel any limitations of the smaller screen. I think part of the reason that made me like the new iPad Mini was that lately I have got a MBPr and the need for a larger retina screen now is satisfied by the laptop while the compactness of the tablet becomes more important.\n\nHowever, there are two main problems that I have with the new Mini. One, is the limited gamut of the screen. I might be picky, but I do see the difference and not only side by side, but also when moving from one device to another. The larger iPad's home screen looks simply gorgeous in comparison to the Mini's home screen. (Probably, part of the reason is that I kept iOS 6 on my iPad 3 and it's color scheme is less \"whitish.\")\n\nAnother problem is pricing. How come after all these years of upgrading its larger tablets without increasing the price Apple decided to do it differently with the iPad Mini? The \"original\" iPad Mini was $330 and the iPad Mini retina is $400? Yes, the Mini got better, but the Air got better too with no price increase, same thing with iPad 4, iPad 3, and iPad 2. If they kept the price at $330 I would overlook the bleaker screen and go for it. Or if the screen had 100% gamut I would pay $400. But not both. I can not justify paying that much money while not feeling that I am getting a premium product. There are way cheaper tablets out there with 100% gamut and I do not want to pay $400 for a tablet and feel that it is inferior to a $220 tablet when it comes to such an important parameter as its screen.\n\nYou can see how much fewer reviews of this tablet are out there on amazon compared to the iPad Air. Seems like people are just not buying this model as much. I am returning the Mini and waiting until Apple comes up with an upgraded model that has 100% gamut screen. And they better not add another $70-$100 chunk on the top of the price when it happens!"}
