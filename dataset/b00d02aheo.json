{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I never write reviews and I am writing this one from my tab 3. I have the nexus 10 that I am now getting rid of.  The 8 inch is the perfect size and weight. The ir remote  feature is awesome as it can also be my universal remote control, especially when I travel and am in hotels (no need to touch the dirty hotel remote control) and for home as well. This device is truly a perfect life companion. You will not disappointed if you purchase one of these."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "Updated Review - July 10, 2015 (ONE YEARS of ownership): So I have found that this tablet CONTINUES to exceed all of my expectations and more!  In July 2014, it dated OTA to Kit Kat 4.2.2 (Kernel version date June 17, 2014). Now this tablet is more up to date! As a proud owner of this tablet for TWO YEARS, I will say that it still works like new. No, it does not have Lollipop, but I am happy with the peppy performance of this tablet! So, if you are looking a high quality eight inch tablet, this may very well be the once for you! So below, I am listing the many Pros I personally have found while using this tablet:\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Overall Speed And Performance and Android OS:\nWith the fast 1.5 GHz processor, I have found this to be a very fast tablet and for me, all has been running so smoothly on this tablet. Love that this tablet has 16GB Internal memory.\nThe Android OS (as of July 3, 2014) has 4.2.2 Kit Kat and inside it has Samsung TouchWiz overlay which is beautiful and user friendly. In fact, if you have used a Samsung Galaxy device as S2, S3, S4 or other Galaxy type, you will love the OS and the Samsung Touch Wiz interface on this. Perhaps you have never used Android OS or even a Samsung device? No worries, as this tablet is easy to learn in my opinion.\n\n+ About the new Kit Kat Update (Coming soon to Tab 3 8.0 Tablets): Some of you may be want this update automatically, some of you may not, so if you have NOT decided about upgrading then you are going to need to STOP the tablet or phone from AUTO UPGRADING for you! It will try to auto update to the new OS as soon as it rolls out from the factory, your provider etc.... That is unless you decide to stop this and do the upgrade when you are ready MANUALLY. (Ask me more about this in the comments if you need to do so)...\n\n+ SCREEN SIZE IS JUST RIGHT SIZE - VERY CLEAR/SHARP SCREEN FOR READING eBooks or VIEWING WEBPAGES. (Screen in my opinion is large and has superb clarity/clearness for reading eBooks and webpages as the print is so readable as I find it VERY CLEAR/VIVID. This is a great in-between size tablet to use. And I found that the screen was large enough to read webpages easily or watch videos. The screen has a PPI (pixels per inch) of 189, which renders a crisp and clear screen. **There is a new selection under Settings and Display, under Font, an option to Increase legibility of fonts. I check marked this and noticed that the fonts/letters on the screen, internet and more are very crystal clear. Also, there is in Settings/Display - Screen Mode, with choices of Dynamic, Standard and Movie. And I selected Dynamic and found that the colors are super vivid and very colorful.\n\n+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD - It is said that you can add a 64gb SD card for personal files. In my case, I have a 32GB SD card and still have plenty of room after my songs, files and photos are added. (A 64 GB card has different formatting and I have not used this size, just the 32GB) About SD Cards: Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: They are JUST for your personal files: music, videos, photos, and other files. When you install apps from the Playstore or other sources, they store either in INTERNAL SD Card area or the main internal area. This is the law of the land where Android is concerned and ALL newer Android devices (including Samsung) work this way where storing your downloaded apps are concerned.\n\n+ WiFi Connecting/Speed of WiFi - Setting up WiFi and keeping a great signal and long distance WiFi strong signal is one superb feature on this tablet. So I compared the signal strength with the Tab 3 vs my regular Android phone. The Tab 3 had about 35% stronger signal then the phone. I believe it is because there is a very strong WiFi receiver in this tablet. At home or on the road, I am able to connect to many free WiFi hotspots very easily with great signal strength.\n****Do you need to know how to get on the internet when you are out of a WiFi range? Ask me about this as I have written an article on how to do this using a MiFi type of service from different service providers (please ask in the comment section for more info).\n\n+ Internet/Watching Online Flash Videos: After I installed Adobe Archived Flash I can watch internet (flash) videos directly. Because this is archived flash it does take a little longer to load flash videos. If you need instructions on how to do this, please ask in the comments and I will answer this or any questions.\n*Viewing of webpages in browsers on this tablet: Reading/viewing a webpage is OUTSTANDING using this tablet as the fonts, pictures and videos are very crisp and clear as well as the colors are very vivid.\n\n+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word, Excel, Text Files and much more on this tablet: This comes with a OK app for reading Office documents, however, I prefer Kingsoft Office which is a free app from Playstore. It is the best I have ever tried and I am very picky about so called Office programs. It is very compatible with MS Office as it reads, edits and creates Office files and reads PDF files, and it has more features of any other Android Office program that I tried. This app is a MUST have for tablet owners in my opinion.\n\n+ Home Videos - The stock video player is OK and plays MOST home videos, however, may I suggest QQ Player, this is a free App from Playstore and it plays every home video I tried). Also MX Video Player is very good, however, I prefer QQ Player.\n\n+ Music Player/Sound Quality - Stock player has clear sound through the outside \"speakers\" are really OK. Better with good quality headphones or a BlueTooth Speaker. To sync easily with Windows Media Player may I suggest the Playstore app free called WinAmp for the tablet as it is very highly rated and the sound is SUPERB!\n\n+ Battery Life- Excellent, so far, however, this is what I have found: When I am on WiFi, I go to the websites I need and then as soon as I am done (reasonable time), I exit the browser (or YouTube, etc) and TURN OFF WiFi. However, I run my brightness at 100%. So this seems to keep the battery going longer. *In addition, I have found that my battery life is improved over the Tab 2 7.0 and the Tab 2 10.1.\n\n+ Kindle App - I installed the Kindle App and synced my Kindle books. Began to read a new book and was very impressed with how exceptional the book rendered using this Tab 3 8.0. Very impressed as the text was very crisp and clear.\n\n+ Camera - The 5MP rear camera on this Tab 3 8.0 has improved over the Tab 2 line. There is no flash on the camera, yet there are several helpful modes to enhance your shots. For me, I use Auto mode. And I tried the camera and video and was happily surprised in the quality - it is pretty good. However, I will continue to use my regular camera for serious picture taking and videos.\n\n+ OTG USB Compatible - You can add an optional OTG (On the Go Micro USB adapter cable to the Micro port for copying files to your flash drive and from your flash drive to the Tab 3). I already had one from my Note I and it works great on the Tab. You can also plug in a mouse, I tried it and it worked. *Note that portable external hard drives and portable DVD/CD drives will not work using OTG in the Tab 3 as I discovered when I tried to read my hard disks via OTG in the Tab 3. However, it is still good to know that you can easily plug in your flash drive and copy files to the Tab 3 and from Tab 3 to PC--what a time-saver.\n\n+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices as well as Bluetooth keyboards, Bluetooth Stereo Headsets, Bluetooth speakers (all I tried) and copied files at a great rate of speed. SUPERB and FAST Bluetooth.\n\n+ Screenshots: There is no ICON for screenshots, however, to take a quick screenshot, hold down home button and power button (at the same time), and then it will take a beautiful screenshot. You can find your screenshot in MyFiles, Internal Storage, Pictures, and Screenshots. I use this sometimes for a map on the internet it saves time and this way it is SAVED for later viewing when I am offline.\n\n+ MICRO USB PORT - No more having to use the old type of (non standard) USB charger/cable that the Tab 2 line had. However, this tablet requires a 2 AMP USB Charger to charge the tablet so it will not charge on a standard 1 AMP (phone charger) as I tried and only the 2 AMP one will work. This tablet uses the same Micro 2 AMP type of chargers that the Galaxy Note 8 uses.\n\nCON (Just ONE however, NOT the fault of Samsung):\n\n- Just one con/concern: New Adobe Flash is not supported, however, I found that archived flash gets the online videos to play and they even play in the stock browser. So I downloaded the older archived flash which gives me the ability to view many internet videos. If you need instructions, just ask me in the comments and I will answer.\n\n* Bottom line/My Suggestions to You: Would I buy this WiFi only model over again? Yes because this Tab 3 8.0 is lightweight, easy to hold in ONE HAND, and it just as easy to hold as the Tab 3 7 inch, yet has so much more screen real-estate than the Tab 3 7 inch and clarity etc, for just 90 dollars more, this is a MUCH BETTER BUY! And I have found because the screen is so crisp and clear, it reads internet pages CLEARER, Videos are larger and much clearer to see etc. And the 8 inch is so easy to pop into a briefcase, bag or purse etc than say a large 10 inch is...if you travel and want to go light, may I suggest this Tab 3 8.0 to you!\nAlso, since I am somewhat of a techie person, I will be glad to answer any questions that you may have. Just ask in the comment section and I will answer promptly."}

My little brother has the galaxy tab 2 7.0 and I liked it. But this is deffentily better. I was really surprised I could just walk in and get one today considering it just came out today. :) Very happy with samsung."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "So it's been three days since I got my Galaxy Tab 3 8\" (my brother is a manager at BestBuy so I got it early if you are wondering) and before I start my review, I just want to say that I used to own an iPhone 5 but ditched it for a Galaxy S4 and now I'm ditching my iPad Mini for a Galaxy Tab 3 8\". I've literally had enough of Apple products and will not be buying their products any longer. I have become an Android fanboy and literally love all the products that Samsung makes.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 has the same look and feel as the Galaxy S4 but it's just bigger which I have no problems with. My brand new Galaxy Tab 3 8\" makes my iPad Mini look like a joke in everything that I have tested so far, from battery life, web browsing to 3D games etc. The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 comes with the latest version of Android which is Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) and it is liquid smooth. I haven't experienced a single slow down so far and everything seems to open very quickly. It also has a very fast CPU (Mali 400) that runs at 1.5Ghz and handles 3D games like a champ. I have listed some things below that I love about the Tab 3 8.0.\n\nThese are some of the things that I love about the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0:\n\nPros:\n\n+Build Quality / Design:\n\nIf you are familiar with Samsung's devices and have no problems with their glossy plastic design, then you will love the design of Tab 3 8.0 as well. The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 has a nice thin bezel that's thinner than its predecessor and also better looking as well. While my iPad mini was made of aluminum, Samsung continues to use the same glossy plastic with their devices and this isn't a bad thing by any means because my Galaxy S4 is plastic as well and I absolutely love it. The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is a bit taller than my iPad Mini but also a bit narrower and both of them are extremely light, around 310g.\n\n+Web Browsing:\n\nThe web browsing experience is awesome on the Tab 3 8.0, everything looks sharp and loads quickly. I'm not using the stock browsing app because it lacks many features that I use on a daily basis but instead, I'm using Chrome and Dolphin Browser. I'm also not using the stock Samsung keyboard because it doesn't have the swipe feature that I use quite a lot so I downloaded the official Google keyboard from the Play Store and I love it. I highly recommend you guys try the official Google Keyboard if you want a clean and slick keyboard that's not cluttered with a lot of useless stuff.\n\n+Screen/Display:\n\nThe Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is the perfect size for me because tablets that are usually 7 inches are too small (I have large hands btw) and tablets that are over 9 inches are sort of big and this makes the Tab 3 8.0 the sweet spot for me. The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 has a nice 8 inches screen that makes everything looks sharp with vivid colors when watching HD videos or playing games. The colors and viewing angles are fantastic, I have absolutely no complaints. The screen resolution and ppi is also much higher on the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 (1280x800, 189ppi) than the iPad mini (1024x768, 162ppi) so this makes everything look sharper on the Tab 3 8.0.  The iPad Mini has an aspect ratio of 4:3 while my Tab 3 8.0 has an aspect ratio of 16:10.\n\n+Android OS:\n\nIt ships with the most up to date version of Android, Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) which is the fastest Android version yet. Everything is liquid smooth, from web browsing, watching HD videos, recording videos and playing intensive 3D games. Samsung has added many new features to TouchWiz which is great but I'm not really a fan of TouchWiz. I usually just disable all the things that I don't use to improve the performance of the tablet and the battery life. I just wish Google would force all these manufactures to use stock Android OS instead of coming with pre-installed bloatware and whatnot that slows the tablet down and kills the battery life.\n\n+Camera:\n\nThe rear camera on the Tab 3 8.0 is 5MP (2592x1944 pixels) and the front camera is 1.3MP. It can only take 720p videos which is more than acceptable for me but it would have been better if it had an 8MP camera and took 1080p videos. My iPad mini was able to take 1080p videos @30fps and I just wish I had that option with the Tab 3 8.0. There's nothing wrong with 720p and 5MP camera because it takes great pictures and videos and this is not really a deal breaker for me.\n\n+Battery:\n\nThe battery on the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is 4450 mAh which is more than enough to last a full day (brightness turned down a bit) with a single charge if you watch YouTube videos, web browsing, picture taking or even watch HD movies for that matter. I can get through the day with a single charge and still have 10% left at the end of the day. My brightness is currently set at 40% and it's perfectly visible both indoors and outdoors. The battery life is one of the most important aspects when deciding which tablet to buy for me because I travel a lot and I need a tablet that can last the entire day.\n\n+Storage:\n\nWith the option of an external sdcard, the Tab 3 8.0 supports an sdcard of up to 64GB. If you are someone who wants that amount of space on their tablet than you have that option with the Tab 3 8.0. I can store as many pictures, music, games and HD videos as I want and it will never come close to being full. I am the type of person who stores large collections of pictures, music, videos, and movies and the Tab 3 8.0 lets me do all of that easily. I also play 3D games that require a minimum of 2-3GB of space and this tablet is perfect for that. It comes with 16GB of storage (11.2GB usable) which is plenty for taking a ton of pictures/videos, installing large 3D games and whatnot.  It also comes with 1.5GB of ram which is three times as more as my iPad Mini (512MB). I hated the lag that I would get when running out of ram on my iPad mini but now I don't have that problem with my new Tab 3 8.0.\n\n+Processor:\n\nThe Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 comes with ARM Mali-400 which is a dual core CPU that runs at 1.5Ghz and it has no problems handling everything you throw at it, from 3D games to HD videos. The tablet comes with a ton of bloatware as always and I always try to disable most of it because it can really waste precious battery life and slow down the tablet. I rarely ever use all the features that Samsung provides so I just disable it. The Mali-400 has no problems playing games such GTA Vice City on the highest settings and that says a lot about the performance of the CPU. Multi-tasking is fantastic on the Tab 3 8.0 because it has a ton of ram and a fast CPU to handle all your apps running in the background if you need to.\n\nCons:\n\n-Not 1080p display:\n\nI just wish Samsung would have upgraded the display to 1080p since that's the standard nowadays but oh well, I'm perfectly fine with what I have. That's the only negative that I can think of but it's not a deal breaker for me because it won't make a huge difference to the eyes even if it had a 1080p screen.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOverall, the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is the perfect tablet for people who want a mid-range device with amazing specs that's not too small and not too big but somewhere in between. The Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 fills the sweet spot for me and the fact that it lasts a full day with the brightness turned day a bit is great for me. I can get all of my work done when traveling without having to constantly charge the device. It also comes with a fast CPU, Mali-400 that runs at 1.5Ghz and has a ton of ram, 1.5GB. I was a little disappointed that it didn't come with a 1080p screen but it's not the end of the world because it still delivers an amazing web browsing experience, watching HD videos, battery life and playing 3D games. The iPad Mini is $349.99 while the Tab 3 8.0 is only $299.00 and it's still faster and better overall. I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 to anyone who want the best mid-range tablet on the market!\n\nI hope this was helpful and I will update my review once I do more tests. If you guys have a question about the tablet then just leave a comment and I will respond."}

Seems plenty fast.\n2.) Nice build quality\n3.) More than enough instructions I guess. I only read a couple of the instructions and just used it. That's how technology should work but I imagine if there is an issue I can look it up.\nDrawbacks:\n1.) Case is (very) slippery so putting it into a case that is less slippery might be a good idea so it does not \"escape\".\n2.) Battery was discharged when it arrived and did not seem to get charged off the \"smart USB\" on my computer but charging it with the supplied charger worked like a champ.\n3.) Depending on how you use it, you may think it discharges too fast. The charging port on my computer barely maintains the battery charge (and loses a little bit) when gaming."}

Not only have I put a huge amount of apps on it, but dropped it several times, so it has definitely taken a beating. I finally broke down and got a Boji rubberized case for it but mostly because it's just easier to hold (and not drop). Not even sure if you can actually buy the 2013 version now, but would probably opt for that rather than the current version. Worth every penny!"}

We haven't found a solution, so my parents have basically just stopped using it. By the way, our router is strong enough that we get Wifi in our neighbors house on our other devices."}

On the 21st month, nine months after the warranty expired the battery quit charging.  I bought a new battery and it won't charge. I called Tech. support and was informed my warranty had expired.  I was told by Tech. Support ( after going through all of the reset drills ) that I might need to replace the charging port, and if that didn't work it was probably a motherboard issue.  I replaced the charging port and the new battery still doesn't charge.  So I guess its the motherboard.  I have found that this is an issue that many people are having.  POOR CONSTRUCTION."}

I had a battery issue about 6 months after purchase (brand-new), and now it's less than 2 years old and the screen totally died for seemingly no reason at all- i was in the middle of reading a webpage when it happened.  It can power on still but the screen is useless.  Replacing the LCD screen is so expensive it's better to just put that money towards a new device, which i plan to do, however i will not be buying from Samsung.  i believe, due to the nature of it's demise despite being undamaged, that these machines are cheap and designed to fail after a certain amount of time.  Other brands seem to last longer.  Buy a better product, this one is not worth it in the long run."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I bought this Android tablet in spite of being a Mac partisan, with two iMacs to connect it to. I wanted to check out the competition. It's comparable to an iPad Mini. On balance, it's a good purchase.\nPros: A better popup keyboard than on an iPad. It's less of a pain to use it, e.g., the numbers are on the same panel as the QWERTY keys.\n  -Although mine came with only 16GB, it does accept up to a 64GB card for mass storage. I don't think iPad Minis have that yet.\n  -Good camera- 5MP. Note-the newer models come with a smaller camera sensor.\nCons: The Samsung support website is not ready for prime time. For example, this is a tablet, right? It has no 3G or 4G or simcard or  service  provider such as Verizon? The Samsung website won't recognize a Galaxy anything without an indication of  its service provider. So you\n  are  SOL for submitting a help request any way but email. No phone, no chat.\n  -I suppose it's to be expected, but the tablet does not sync easily with Macs. It can be done, but it will take experimentation with a variety\n  of third-party solutions. The Samsung Kies application may or may not work. To transfer files either way may or may not be possible with:\n  WiFi Transfer Pro, AirDroid, Android File Transfer, or SyncMate, some of which must be installed in the device, some in the computer,\n  some in both. I have two identical iMacs sitting next to each other. One of those apps can establish communication on one of them, but  not  the other, and vice-versa.\nOther than that, I like it.\nRevision 9-14-15: I reduced my rating to 3 stars. Maybe it's because I'm on a Mac, using Kies to transfer files between computer and mobile device, but Kies, the only software that works reliably to do that, will not transfer text files, documents, PDFs, or published material into the Galaxy Tab from the computer. That's a pretty stupid omission, IMHO. It looks like an e-reader, it sounds like an e-reader, and it can be made to act like an e-reader by using Dropbox and Kindle, but if the owner wants to file books or PDFs away in the device itself, rather than be forced to download them or stream them, he or she is SOL. If I had known that going in, it would have been a deal-breaker."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 -8.0\" for use as an Email-Gmail device during overseas travel where telephone service is an issue.  Though the device accepts up to 64 GB, I installed a 32 GB micro SD card which appears more than adequate.  The price was heavily discounted.  This evaluation is based upon my intended use.  I also purchased the MoKo folio cover which is excellent (separate review).\nPROS:\nGreat size:  My wife, with her 10\" iPad, is envious of the 8\" Tab's size and weight.  In horizontal mode, the Tab is quite legible.  Goldilocks sized.\nCamera: The Tab 3's rear camera is 5 MP.  (I have seen the Tab 4's rear camera generally listed as 3 MP.)  With multiple photo options, the Galaxy takes very good photos under a variety of conditions, but my pocket-sized picture camera is a Sony DSC RX-100 with its enlarged sensor.\nTab 3 Screen Resolution:  The 1280x800 resolution is excellent with the 8\" screen.\nUser experience:  On first reading the manual is a bit confusing, however, the Tab 3 is not unlike my Mac, but with a touch screen.  I just fiddled with the Tab for a week or so and gradually features popped out, and I became familiar with a couple of quirks.  Tip:  Put your finger along the center of the edges of the screen of the Tab and motion towards the center of the screen.\nApps:  There are a large number of useful apps the the Galaxy.  I am fully satisfied with the selection.\nBuild:  Thus far the Tab 3 seems well built with no particularly flimsy weak spots.  Other reviewers, however, have had problems with the connector so I am careful when making the power connection.\nCONS:\nSpeed:  On first startup it takes a few moments for the Tab 3 to blow the cobwebs out.  It won't win any gunfights, but once warmed up, the execution of the various apps is quick.\nScreen refresh (spinning circle):  A couple of the apps require refreshing from the last shutdown.  One of my weather apps shows yesterday's temperature and forecast until I hit the refresh.  In an autopilot world, these apps seem stick and rudder.  Until you learn which app is which (auto versus manual), the user must check the date and time of the last refresh and manually tap the refresh button to update.  Refreshingly old school (it needs me).\nFinger taps:  Sometimes the finger taps seem ambiguous rather than crisp.  Closing Internet tabs is one example.  Alternating between finger taps and a Rocketfish stylus has worked out well.\nUPDATE:  Traveled to Belize.  Good size for travel.  Good battery life (To turn off apps there is an app in the included apps pages that is a horizontal bar.  Move it up to your main pages and use it to turn off apps.).  No problems with Wifi at Banyan Bay Resort.  Able to Email and to send Tab photos back to US.  Tab camera worked very well.  All-in-all my expectations were fully met.\nSUMMARY\nI would buy the Tab 3 again.  I would recommend the Tab 3 to a friend who intended a similar use, while pointing out the above PRO's and CON's.  The Tab 3 is a relatively inexpensive option (I won't cry if I break it).  Paired with the MoKo case it seems fairly durable (but not bulletproof)."}

Their support site is generic, robotic, and it assumes you're a moron who doesn't know how to charge your device (despite the hoops you'd have to jump through to register your item).

Size is perfect for my kneeboard - 7\" is a bit too small but 9-10\" is too big. The GPS is solid & reliable, though I use a separate Dual GPS receiver connected via BT, which also works flawlessly. This tablet has a great screen - bright, good contrast ratio, natural colors, super clear. The battery life is excellent. Comes with Android 4.2 which is rock solid stable with fast smooth performance and allows you to disable some of the built-in crapplets that you don't want. It is only a dual core, but all apps work fast & smooth so performance is still great.\nIt's a year or so old and there are newer versions with faster processors and higher resolution screens. Yet I don't need them - screen resolution is already excellent, processor is already fast enough, so more pixels and faster processor only shorten battery life with no real benefit."}

The only way I can connect to my wifi is if I am sitting next to my router.  Every other wireless device, 2 Samsung phones, 2 laptop computers and a Kindle Fire, have no trouble any where on my house.  I've spoken to tech support and, what passes for customer service at Samsung numbers of times.  The initial advice from customer service was that my wifi signal was too weak.  Really, then how come all of my other devices with older technology have no problems. After going around that issue for a while I was finally transferred to tech support and after explaining my issue again and again I was told that I would have to return it for repair.  Now this is a brand new tablet, never been used, however I agreed and they had it for 5 days and called to say they could not duplicate my problem but would send it back for for another check and then return it to me.  When I got my tablet back there was NO change.  Another call to customer yielded another useless piece of advice.  I was told my problem was caused by the fact that I had an unsecured network and if I changed that all would be well.  This seemed absurd but I decided to check it out.  I went to my daughter's house who, BTW has the same tablet purchased at the same time, and has a secured network. Absolutely no difference.  I called customer service, again and explained my issue once again and was told that I would have to return the unit for repair.  Been there, done that so I said this was clearly a defective unit and I want a replacement.  After arguing for some time I was transferred to \"executive\" customer service where I was told that I had no option except to return it for repair again.  I requested to speak with that person's supervisor and was continuously refused and it was implied that I have no \"proof\" of my problem thus impugning my honesty.  After demanding in no uncertain terms to speak to a supervisor and a shouting match I was told that I would be called back.  Still waiting for a call back"}

I owned a Tab 2 for a year, then picked up an iPad, then a Tab 3 to compare. If I can sum up my experience with the Tab 3 it's this: underwhelmed.\nMaybe this will help you pick one if you ever face the choice:\n-Apple's OS runs faster and more stable thanks to the much reviled \"Walled Garden\" that is Apple's source code.\nCustimization and built-in adaptations make Android run on so many different devices causes drag.\nI've been a huge proponent of custimization, but I've come to be very annoyed by the trade-off in speed.\n-Android devices are bogged down by the manufacturers' own bloatware, especially Samsung is guilty here.\n-Android apps need updating ALL THE TIME. Every time you switch it on, they need to update 3-6 apps.\n(if you leave it off for a few days, it practically needs 15 min to update everything)\n-Apple has facetime and ITunes, but can also run competing services (Skype, Rhapsody, etc). You can't have it all on Android.\n-A pro for Android is that it's OS allows for multiple user profiles if it's a shared device.\n-Many of Android's apps are free, Apple has more fee-based apps.\n-Android tablets are a lot lighter as they're made of plastic vs the iPad's glass and metal (but you may prefer the look and feel)\n-Apple charges a premium for it's brandname. Thank their marketing department for this one.\nThe glass & aluminum body may appear more expensive, that doesn't mean it's more expensive to manufacture."}

Watching YouTube without any lagging\n- Screen very responsive with multi-touch fingers or stylus\n- Not a full HD display but high resolution video playback (MX player app) still look beautiful\n- Speaker's sound is nice, clear and loud at 128kbps but i think it may even sound better at higher bit rate\n- Headphone produced HQ output sound when listening with my skullcandy earphone \"attacking bass\" version\n- 64gb Sandisk class10 micro external memory working flawlessly\n- \"My File\" works just like MS Windows directory, read both internal and external data. At least i will know which FOLDER i saved my file to\n- Battery can hold for about 8+ hours prior next charge\n- I download Kingsoft and polaris apps to view or edit my resume. Very convenience if i don't have laptop with me\n\nThis tablet is not the best but my expectation is meet and I'm still learning new things now and then. So far i haven't found anything wrong to complaint about . A very nice piece of technology at a fractional of the price. Im very happy with my purchased and hope it will last me a long time."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I'm glad I got it, especially for the refurbished price.  This is actually the 2nd one I bought (I got a white one for my wife first, and liked it enough to get another for me, but decided to get a different color so they're more easily distinguished when lying around the house.\n\nI love the 8\" size, and I feel that the added RAM (vs. 7\" model) makes a difference in performance.  I do wish Samsung had done a couple things differently: (a) I wish it was slightly wider, so the bezel around the screen was larger, which would allow it to be held more easily without putting your thumb on the screen. (b) I wish the back was textured (not glossy/slick) so it was easier to hold.  That might also have made \"a\" not as much of an issue.  I did just order a case for it, which may make both of these issues go away, and neither is enough to make me wish I didn't get it.  It's a very nice tablet.\n\nThe color is NOT exactly as described.  The \"gold\" really isn't gold.  It's more of an antique bronze.  It's actually a nice color, just not \"gold\" as Samsung calls it.\n\nBattery life exceeds my expectation, and I've never felt it was slow/lagging in any way.\n\nThe one thing I wish Samsung didn't do, however, is put the menu/home/return buttons outside of the screen.  It does allow more screen space to be used by apps, BUT it's not as intuitive when you use it in landscape mode, and if you flip it upside down, it's quite silly.  But that's Samsung -- they've always done this and continue to do it.\n\nIt also comes with quite a bit of Samsung bloatware installed.  Some you can uninstall, others you can \"hide\" (disable)....and some are okay apps.  Once I customized the screen / apps the way I prefer, they're not an issue, but it's just something I thought I'd mention.\n\nThe camera is okay -- nothing great, but not terrible.  Outside / bright light is better than indoors, but neither is anything to get excited about.  Video recording is limited to 720p.  I use my phone for my main camera anyway, so this doesn't bother me.\n\nThe sound through the speakers is quite good and can be turned up quite loud!  I was impressed.  The speaker placement (bottom, when in portrait mode) means you don't get the stereo effect when in landscape mode, which is kind of dumb, because that's how it would typically be oriented when watching movies on it.\n\nI find it plenty bright, and generally have the brightness set to manual (not auto) and at maybe 20%.  I hate the automatic mode....just like I hate it on their S3 phone.  It has a delay in changing the brightness when it detects a change in ambient light, and it seems like then it just switches between \"too dim\" and \"brighter than necessary\".  Since the level is so easy to manually set (in pull-down tray), that's how I use it.\n\nIf you're planning on occasionally sharing it with your kids, like I do, you can set up multiple users and make the kids a \"restricted\" user where you can limit what apps they have access to.  Just beware that, for example, if you give them access to the video player or gallery to view photos, then they can view ANY video or photo on the device.  You restrict apps, not access to locations.  (Fine for me.)\n\n(My only other comment has to do with Android 4.4, NOT this tablet in particular.  Google, for some ridiculous reason, made 4.4 such that apps cannot write to the external microSD card.  They can read, but not write.  Oddly, they can also create a folder, but then not be able to write into it.  System apps (i.e. the file manager app) that come with the device / are part of Android DO have full access to the external microSD card.  That means, for example, if I use my favorite photo editor, I have to save changes to the internal flash, then use the file manager to copy from the internal flash to the external card if I wanted it there.  Likewise for other things, such as the built in \"gallery\" can read/write pictures anywhere, but my favorite photo/gallery app can read/write to internal flash, but only read from the external microSD card.  DUMB.  But that's Android 4.4's fault, not the tablet's.)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I'm a confirmed Apple fan, with several iDevices in my home.  A previous experience with a very low end Android tablet and phone had left a bad taste in my mouth, but this Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 has totally changed my mind on the Android ecosystem.\n\nA friend had shown me an app (DroidTV) that I really wanted to use since I cut out cable TV, but it isn't available on iDevices.  That convinced me to try another Android tablet, and I chose this one primarily because I ran across a really good short lived sale on it.  I have been using it for about 6 weeks now, and I haven't regretted my purchase at all.\n\nThe display is bright and sharp, and I like the 8\" screen.  I looked at some 7\" tablets at a local electronics store, and they were much too small for my preference.  Even though the tablet feels well made, it is still light enough to easily carry in my purse on a daily basis without noticing the weight.  The speakers are surprisingly good for their size, although I typically listen with a pair of Bluetooth headphones.  The processor is snappy, and I haven't experienced any lag time at all.  Since I download a lot of video for future viewing, I really appreciate the expandable memory of this tablet.  I'm currently using a Samsung 32GB Pro Micro SDHC Class 10 memory card in this unit, but I plan on upgrading that to a 64GB card in the near future.\n\nThis tablet seems to have a stronger Wi-Fi receiver than my iPad mini.  I sometimes get a weak Wi-Fi signal in certain areas of my home, and I haven't experienced that problem with this Samsung tablet.  I've been very pleased with the battery life, especially since I mainly use the tablet for viewing video.  I do turn off the Wi-Fi when I'm not using it, to prevent that drain on the battery.\n\nMy only small complaints about this tablet are the somewhat dismal camera, and the way the glossy plastic back picks up fingerprints.  However, I don't really take photos with a tablet, and I have the tablet in a case anyway, which covers up the fingerprints.  All in all, I'm very pleased with this tablet.  When my current iPad 4 is due to be replaced, I will probably seriously consider the 10 inch Samsung tablet to replace it."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I purchased this tablet at a retailer due to the $199 price being my personal tipping point. I had demoed this tablet a few times at electronic stores and knew that it seemed \"good enough\" for what I wanted, but was continually put off by the $289 price, sometimes reduced to $250 with mail-in rebate, etc. As soon as the Tab 4 came out, I knew the price on the Tab 3 would be reduced, so I started looking and found the best price. Hopefully Amazon retailers follow suit with this.\n\nIn any case, I find myself wishing I had spent the extra $90 or $100 last year. This tablet is very good for having a sub-par processor and less than optimal ppi.\n\nYes, you can pick up a better tablet in the same form factor from the same brand for a 35% bump in price. However, for value, this tablet does not seem to be beatable at the current prices unless they are cut further still."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I personally enjoy the samsung galaxy tab but I bought it for my 8 year old autistic son when he cracked the screen on his i-Pad.  There was definitely a learning curve involved for him because androids do not close applications when you hit the home button.  You have to back out of them.  My son does not understand that.  We had a couple of frustrating weeks where the sounds from more than one program would be playing.  My one complaint with this tablet is that it has a charging problem.  It just doesn't want to charge sometimes even though it says it is.  Also, sometimes when you plug it in nothing happens and you have to restart it.  I can usually fix the charging issue by holding down the power button for 30 seconds which supposedly resets the battery but this shouldn't be necessary as it is brand new.  This seems to be a widespread problem with these tablets.  I bought the 2 year warranty and have been considering sending it in but that also means we'll be without the tablet for awhile."}

They promptly sent me out a new tablet. The customer service definitely impressed me. The new tablet doesn't seem to hold a charge for as long as the first one did, but it does charge!

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I gave it 5 stars because I like it very much.  In fact I have a hard time thinking right now of something I don't like about it.  But hang on I will come up with somethng.\n\nFrankly I had my doubts that the Tab 3 8.0 would come up to the standards of my now deceased Nook HD+(it died on me when  I dropped it).\n\nIt was like I lost a close friend.\n\nAside from its vanilla home page with that  carousel thing., the Nook HD+ was a darn good tablet with much larger screen resolution than the Tab 3 8.0 with more pixels etc. . I rooted it and added Apex Launcher adding  themes I liked and thought it to be the cat's meow.\n\nSo  when I replaced it with this Tab 3 tablet I had wondered how the display was going to look and that TouchWiz thing (that had not met with the approval of many a geek probably because it's too uncomplicated) no doubt would perform sub par to the Apex Launcher.\n\nThe other concern was the size.  Here was this 8 inch tablet.  The Nook HD+ had a 9 inch display.\nI wondered how it would be going from a larger to a smaller screen.\n\nI prepared myself for a let down.\n\nUpon un boxing it and powering it up...was I surprised.\n\nThe images, (photos, movies, fonts, text... everything) were sharp the colors deep and it appeared this Samsung 8 inch screen was  brighter than the Nook's.\n\nIt also had, IMHO, acceptable speed of performance.\n\nDidn't take long to get aquainted with TouchWiz and all its wonderful features. I find using it is a thoroughly enjoyable experience. It is so well designed and intuitive. I take my hat off to its developers who obviously had ordinary tablet users like me in mind rather than  geeks in producing it.\n\nAs far as size .....I don't miss my old Nook HD+ 9 inch.. No.  The Tab 8 inch display is very nice and much lighter and thinner.\nEasy to hold in my hand.\n\nGetting back to the TouchWiz features.\n\nOne of my favorites is that with one swipe you can, at anytime,  summon a drop down settings menu where you can adjust brightness, airplane mode, sync etc.  This is so quick and convenient.  I like it's shortcuts too.  I have put a Weather Underground bookmark shortcut on my home page, where, with a tap I quickly get weather information for my immediate neighborhood.\nApex Launcher is very good.  However I don't plan on downloading Apex Launcher as TouchWiz has features Apex doesn't have and is more user friendly as far as I am concerned.\n\nI did a lot of research...read lots of owner reviews of comparable 8 inch tablets including the Dell Venue 8, Asus Memo Pad 8,  and the LG G Pad 8.3.  But when the smoked cleared I felt most comfortable going with the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0. (The Nook HD+ is no longer manufactured). Have been served well with other Samsung products.  Still have my Gravity dumb phone (dropped it on more than one occasion and continued to work just fine without a hiccup) and my Samsung 19inch monitor continues to function well.\n\nI use it mostly for surfing the web, ebook reading, word games like Word Fued ,and crosswords, youtube, TuneIn  and Iheart radio sports talk shows, and reading online newspapers, and email.  It does its job in a smooth and reliable manner with good battery life.  Haven't experienced any problems.\n\nStill trying to  think of something I don't like about this tablet.\n\nOne thing is for sure.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab 3 8 inch tablet has made me forget my old Nook HD+.\n\nUPDATE 6/22/14:As I know a lot of us have questions on how well one can read a tablet's screen in bright sunshine...so......\nhere's my sunshine test of the Tab 3 8.0:  The sun was actually shining here in Seattle recently so I seized the opportunity to conduct this test over a period two days.\n\nDay 1: I was seated at a park bench in early afternoon, surrounded by lush, green grass with the sun shining directly on my face.  The tablet was on my lap and at an angle that mostly sheilded it from the rays.  I had brightness set at maximum.  I was able to play the word game Classic Word for a good hour and a half being able to read the letters and score with not much problem.  I was out of range of any wifi hot spot  so I couldn't surf but was able to see and read everything on my lock page, home page,  app icons, widgets, etc..  I used the tablet without and without sunglasses.  This didn't seem to make much difference one way or the other in helping to see the screen better. However in that I am long in tooth having eyes with nearly 80 years of experience (and perhaps more sensitive to bright sunshine)  the sunglasses helped cut the glare ....this had more to do with me than the tablet.\n\nDay 2: Again early afternoon but this time I was seated at a different park bench (  again surrounded by lush green grass) so I was facing away from the sun (ol' sol on my right shoulder) with the tablet on my lap this time with the screen totally engulfed by sunshine. Again I had brightness at full bore setting.  I could still make out the screen ok and played the word game for a good two hours this time.  If anything there was a smidgen of a challenge in making out the screen lock screen, home page etc as in the Day 1 test but it wasn't a really a factor as all were visible enough to play the game and navigate the pages. I found wearing the sunglasses for a moment or two had no effect either way and went without them.\n\nConclusion: The Tab 3 unleashed upon me yet another surprise with this test.  I have had bad luck with other electronic device screens in trying to view them in sunshine.  I own a IPod Touch 4th generation and  it is extremely difficult to read it's screen in the sun.  The Nook HD+ tablet , camera, and phone's I've owned  were also sunshine challenged.  However because the Tab 3  8.0 has a very bright screen I beleive this does make a difference.\nI would have to say I was satisfied (bordering on slightly impressed) with how the tablet performed for me under these conditions.\nWe all have our individual likes and dislikes and varying perspectives and opinions so perhaps others would have, after performing this identical test, come up with different conclusions.\n\nFor instance my surroundings of green grass were much less reflective than say  the white sands of a tropical beach, or any other bright tablet viewing environment.\nBut anyway I feel this fine tablet passed my sunshine test.\n\nI mentioned I own an Apple product (an Ipod Touch) .\n\nOne of the things I so appreciate about this  tablet is the ease of downloading apps from Google Play. It is so much faster and more user friendly than the Apple Store experience.\n\nI did not purchase the Tab 3 8 inch tablet for it's cameras but I do appreciate the features particularly panorama mode.  I have a Canon Power shot that I use for most of my photo ops.  But the tablet camera enables me to skype when the opportunity calls for it."}

I'm very impressed with the device itself -- excellent form and functionality, although it's jam-packed with bloatware that you can't remove or disable.  I've been growing more and more angry at Google, though, and today they stepped across the line.\n\nIf you own an Android device, Google is tracking your every move -- literally.  I can't turn off \"Hangouts\" to save my life -- Google knows where I go, who I see, who I call and email.  When I open up Google maps, I see the last dozen addresses of where I've been -- Google keeps track.\n\nAnd today, June 12, they've gone too far.  Google Play Store updated (that's where you get your apps), and now you can't download FREE APPS unless Google has your credit card on file.\n\nScrew this.  It's too late to return it, so I'm stuck with this spycam computer.  It works great, does what I want it to do, but I'm not going to be Google's bitch.

And shes not very tech savy but she can save pics, listen to music, browse the web, and open email links easily. This kills the kindle hdx. My girlfriend has one and.for the price its the most stripped down featureless device over ever seen compared to this. The only upside to the hdx is the depth it has in sound and the tight pixels it has. But no camera front or back like this, no usb otg, and a very stripped down app store. Also non amazon approved apps make it behave weird. This tab 3 AWESOME buy this over a kindle install the kindle app and have the best.of both worlds. Why compromise when u can have a sweet tablet?

Compared to an iPad mini there is no comparison, the mini wins hands down.  Colors are better, touch response time is better, overall experience is better.  My wife has the mini and I tried both side by side so I am giving good info.  The price though is $100 more than this unit, which I didn't want to pay.  I love the mocha gold color and trim, looks classy.  I bought a Fosman TPU cover for it and it protects it well, without it was too slippery.  It is a thin, lightweight tablet.  Battery lasts all day for me and I use it a lot.  I play Clash of Clans and it has a slight lag in the touch screen when I pinch & zoom, which the mini does not.

Her first grandson was her inspiration to get online and so I bought her this tablet - though I honestly was worried she would have a difficult time with it. With help from a friend, she now has gmail and we are emailing every few days - and she feels close to her grandson as a result. She did say that learning how to use the tablet has been a learning curve for her, but in just a month or so, her typing went from barely legible to completely perfect so I can see it's helping her and she is more confident now because she's online like the rest of the world. I knew she'd come a long way when, the other day, she emailed me from a cafe  - imagining my mother in a cafe on her tablet makes me SO HAPPY.

I don't have (and don't want) a smart-phone, as I have no interest in talking on the phone or texting all the time, but I did want some of the features of the smart phone, and this Galaxy Tab has them.  It has a camera, it allows me to access wifi for mail and the Web, and with a Kindle app uploaded, it allows me to read my Kindle books too-- although I have to say the reading feature is not as good as my old Kindle.  The back-lit screen is harder on the eyes than the Kindle, and I don't recommend reading by the screen's light alone.  With a lamp on, it's fine.  You can adjust the screen brightness, and that's useful.  The device is bigger than a cell phone, but smaller than a laptop; it's light; it fits easily into my handbag.  I  look forward to taking it on summer road trips.  The size makes it easier for me to use-- I have big fingers.  The on-screen keyboard takes some getting used to.  Oddly, the most irritating thing about this tablet is its quick response.

In 20 minutes, I had set up the basics AND gotten my Amazon Kindle books and Android Apps. No muss, no fuss.\n\nMy \"kids\" are iPad/Apple nuts, and I just don't see it. I think that, without instructions, even my 6 and 8 year old grandkids could use this tablet! Well, they already know Samsung, iPad, and iPhones and have tutored me. THIS tablet IS intuitive and spelled out beautifully on several display pages. (You can group app icons, put them on a grid, sort them alphabetically, and there's always the \"Settings\" button that whisks you right to the most important - and easy - menus.\n\nThis tablet has its own version of Siri. Ask her how far it is to Key West, and she doesn't just show a Google map, she tells you that it's 3300 miles, and then shows you the route! I wish I had Google Voice in my car! Ask her what motels are in Winnemucca, and she tells you. (It's a secret, but Siri uses Google...) True, she can't pronounce Winnemucca, but only Raj would care. (Note that this needs wi-fi. It's only a smart tablet.)\n\nWe got these Galaxies because we can look at photos from our cameras after a day's \"shoot\" because our cameras use SDHC cards, and the Galaxy reads them. And if we need extra storage, we just pop in a 64GB SHDC card, and we have it! We would have gone to a Kindle HD, but there's no external storage and that's a deal breaker. I don't want a drop box or cloud. I want to see the pictures we've taken, and then I'll upload them to my web site and my PC when I get home and am finished cropping.\n\nThe cameras - front and rear - don't interest me. We always have a camera in the car, and carry two with us when we're out hiking. I could get a shot of that UFO much faster with our Canons than a Samsung. Because this review revolves around OUR wants and needs, I'm still rating it with 5 stars.\n\nThe display is top notch, and can automatically adjust for different lighting which it does very well. And changing fonts in almost any app and Kindle books is easy. The Asus Win8 could never increase the size of a screen font to more than its original miniscule 3 points!\n\nIt even set up my email without me having to do anything but enter it. No more POP accounts and all that stuff.\n\nSince I don't know if you can take Jelly Bean OS seriously (I mean, seriously, Jelly Bean?), but if this tablet is considered a computer, then it's the most \"fun\" I've had in the 37 years I've had Dells and Apples. (Yeah, I don't get out much.)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the time it takes to charge the Galaxy. About 4 hours with a wall socket, but then it has a battery life of 10 hours, but I don't download much, and other than Wimp and YouTube, I don't watch video. Still, it runs rings around the iPad Mini and equals the Kindle if not a little better for battery life.\n\nI highly recommend the Tab 3.\n\nEW"}

I could have bought a galaxy tab and saved myself some money..  And let me tell you its the same thing.  I own both and you can even make an argument that the galaxy is better because you can upgrade the memory if you want and with a usb adapter hook up an portable hard drive.  I cant really see anything that the ipad does that the galaxy doesnt do.  Im sure theres minor things but definitely not enough to pay $100 to $200 more in some cases.  So far this review is all Apple bashing but its because I think its relevant to point these things out.  Also Im salty that I got drunk off the Apple kool aid and bought an ipad knowing in my gut and being told from a good friend whos huge techy guy that any of the android or window tabs are just as good and in some cases better.\n\nAs far as this tab goes to me its perfect.  The picture is awesome, the camera is good, the sound is great and its user friendly.  I cant really come up with anything I would call a con.  Again I own a full size ipad and this 8 inch galaxy and its the same fn thing aside from the size of course.  At the time of this writing its still the same $249.99 I paid for it.  Compare that to $399 for a 16 gb ipad mini.  And remember that you can add a 64gb micro sd card making your device close to 80 gigs.  That will cost you all of $37 for a micro sd card.  The 64gb ipad mini is $599.  This tab cost me $249 plus $37 for the memory card for a grand total of $286 without tax.  Im not a Apple hater  Im trying to explain my experience and don't want you to experience the same buyers remorse that I have.  Just don't see how anyone would pay so much more and you're not getting nearly the same bang for the buck as a non-apple tablet.\n\nHope this review helps you make up your mind."}

Despite some sour grapes criticism, the screen is gorgeous, even better than that of my Kindle Fire HD. It's also much faster than the KFHD.The availability of the micro sdsjlot is a huge advantage, and the ability to use a USB-OTG adapter (and therefore too use a card reader) allows transfer of large amounts of data, text or photos, into and out of the tablet's internal memory, or into the micro sd card (and back out, as full sized files."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "In my humble opinion...\n\nThis device is a little deceiving, it is extremely slim and well designed but it is also heavy in the hand. Perhaps this is a mindglitch as one might expect its small thin appearance to lead to it having an almost weightless feather like feel and it doesn't. Right out of the box i though wow this is a bit heavy (for the size and form).\n\nHaving said that the weight and sometimes sluggish performance are the only flaws with this tablet. I have Samsung GS 4 and I had a Samsung Galaxy Note Tablet 10.1 (it was stolen, hence my need for a new tablet) and I must say that especially because the GS 4 is so lightening fast, playing with both devices at the same time makes it obvious which device just has more power for its performance. I was torn between the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 and chose this one because of the price, but I will say if speed and power are things you just cannot compromise on, pay the extra $100USD and get the new 8.4 Pro.\n\nIt does what I need it to do and it is so stunning, light and 8 really is a perfect size!! I love that it feels like a larger version of my samsung Galaxy s4 so there is no learning curve or shock when I move from device to device. I love samsung for this reason! They have mastered brand loyalty by extension of their products seamlessly working together.\n\nI have a great screen protector by \"AmFilm\" that is an anti-glare/ fingerprint protector so it really makes it not only great for reading but the touch, no need to clean every 5 minutes. The case is a MoKo slim case for the tab in indigo which I was worried would look too purply but it is such a deep blue that is just looks like it must have cost a fortune!!! Soft to the touch and very well designed I feel like all in all, I have an amazing tablet and I will take it out with me more than I did my Galaxy Note 10.1 because I did feel like it was just a bit too big and perhaps just not as portable as an 8inch screen is.\n\nGreat tablet at a now great price!\n\nOnly wish it were a tad lighter!"}

I hype this product up constantly to my friends and family, because I have used the Nexus 7, all iPads released up until March of 2014, and I have used Samsung's Note tablets also. This tablet, being only $250, is definitely my favorite. Sure, if the Samsung Note tablet was $250, I would have gotten that, but it isn't. So, this is by far the best choice. I also love the Brown/Gold color. It makes it look super classy. I just recently ROOTed my tablet just to check it out, and it works perfectly fine still, and I play graphically intense games on it with ease. I love playing Asphalt 8 on it. It is a great, free, game on the app store. I advise EVERYONE to get this tablet. It is perfect for kids, teenagers, young adults, and mature adults. Please be smart, and purchase this tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "It seems like there are at least a million choices in tablet computers nowadays, so it's becoming very difficult to figure out which are the best values.  First off, you have to figure out what features and functions you want the tablet to have, then prioritize your list. AFAIK, all tablets can play music and video clips, and they all have WiFi so that you can browse the Internet and do email, and there are more apps than you can even comprehend. All tablets can serve as e-book readers, although some are optimized for this function, like the Kindle. There are even several choices in operating systems: various flavors of Android OS, Apple's IOS, Windows Mobile, and probably others. I am most familiar with Android v2 (Gingerbread), having owned a 4\" Samsung Galaxy MP3 player for several years, that came with this OS (I still have it and it still works fine, but the screen is too small for comfortable ebook reading, which is why I decided to upgrade to a tablet). I am happy enough with Android, and the available apps on Google Play Store, do I decided to narrow my shopping list to Android tablets.\n\nI looked at all of the available devices on Amazon, which range in price from $100 to $600, and screen size from 7\" to 10\". The very cheapest ones turned out to be no-name Chinese knockoffs of questionable quality and stability, with lots of problems reported by owners, so I eliminated those from consideration. Likewise, I decided to limit my budget to $350, so that cut off the big 10\" models with ultra-high-resolution screens. I also noticed that the 10\" models were double the weight of the 7\" and 8\" models, and I wanted something that would be comfortable to hold for extended periods of reading.\n\nNext, I started researching models for which user-replaceable batteries are available, a feature that's important to me, as I hate dumping electronic gadgets in the trash just because the battery is worn out and can't be easily replaced.  This search quickly narrowed the choices down: I found only a couple of manufacturers for which replacement batteries are available. One of these is Samsung, and the others were all brands that I had already eliminated from consideration for other reasons. I was disappointed to not find a battery replacement for the ASUS MeMo Pad seies; these were high on my list, due to having a much higher screen resolution at the same price point as most other brands, including the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.\n\nAfter extended research, I finally had narrowed the choices down to one of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 models, and based on weight, size, memory, and price, the 8\" model for $269 looked like it was the best value for me. I purchased the tablet and a MoKo case [http://www.amazon.com/MoKo-Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-Case/dp/B00CSMYBFS/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1395853862&sr=8-5&keywords=samsung+galaxy+tab+3+8%22+case], and so far after a couple of months I am very happy with the purchase.\n\nThis tablet has Android v4.2 Jelly Bean as the operating system, which is similar to the older v2 Gingerbread on my MP3 player, except for one major - and extremely annoying - difference: Mass Storage Mode has been removed, and I have not found ANY way to re-enable it or add it back in as an app. Mass Storage Mode allows you to plug the Android device into your desktop or laptop PC with a USB cable, and easily transfer files back and forth between the PC and the device's internal or MicroSD card storage in Windows Explorer. Mass Storage Mode basically turns your device into an \"SD Card Reader\", just like you might use to download images from your digital camera's SD card. You can use various file management tools, like WinMerge, in Mass Storage Mode to compare (synchronize) files on the PC's hard disk to files on the Android device.\n\nWell, when I first plugged this tablet into my desktop machine, which runs XP-32/SP3, the only access I could get was \"digital camera mode\", which limits you to downloading JPEG photos, and only from the DCIM folder on the tablet. After many hours of research on the Internet, and downloading several supposed \"fixes\" for the problem (most of which did not work, including Samsung KIES, surprisingly), I finally found the following solution, that enables the MTP Protocol on Windows XP: 1. Install Windows Media Player Version 11. 2. Install Microsoft User Mode Driver Framework for XP. These two packages finally got MTP mode working on my PC, so I could see the files and folders on the tablet, but MTP is basically crippled from the get-go. You can not use file management tools like WinMerge with it, so it's not really a substitute for Mass Storage Mode.  All of the above problems I experienced are supposedly taken care of in Windows 7 and 8 with built-in MTP drivers, but I have no PC running either of those OS's to test this tablet on. And MTP is still a lousy downgrade from Mass Storage Mode.\n\nSo, other than the unexpected lack of Mass Storage Mode in Android Jelly Bean, what else do I have to say about the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8\"?  Overall, I like it! So far, I have two primary uses for it: 1. As an ebook reader, and 2. as a GPS navigator in my car. I have also used it as an alarm clock, as an MP3 player, as an Internet browser and email tool, as a game platform for playing chess, Angry Birds, and Freecell Solitaire, as a remote controller with a Canon 6D camera, and as a night-sky Astronomy tool with the SkEYE App (this app is really cool, if you live somewhere where it's dark enough to really see the night sky).\n\n1. As an ebook reader: the 1280x800 screen is adequate. Obviously, it won't be quite as sharp as the 1920x1200 screen on the ASUS MeMo Pad tablet, but it's not bad. The color rendition for looking at photos or videos is okay, if not brilliant, and the widely adjustable screen brightness can handle almost any environment except full outdoor sunlight. There's no way to make the screen contrast high enough to use this tablet as an e-reader outdoors in full sunlight. In any less challenging conditions, the screen is good. I use the built-in Adobe Reader with my PDF format ebooks, and re-flow the text. The tablet can also read TXT ebooks with the built-in Polaris Office app.\n\n2. As a GPS Navigator, this 8\" tablet can give some serious competition to a Garmin Nuvi. It is GLONASS enabled, which gives it better capability to maintain position lock in urban areas where you might be surrounded by high buildings, or in deep canyons (think Utah, Arizona, or any mountainous region). I use the MapFactor Navigator app with free Open Street Maps, and it works well (some stability problems, and occasionally obviously wrong turn directions, but this is a problem with the software and the map, and is not the Tablet's fault).  There are several other car navigation and GPS apps on Google Play, I just happen to like this one because the process of downloading and installing bulk map updates is easy and automatic. The big 8\" screen on the Samsung Tablet makes it VERY nice as a car navigator, compared to the much smaller screen on most cell phones, Nuvi, and TomTom type devices.\n\nBattery life for non-processor intensive tasks, like looking at still photos or reading ebooks, seems to be at least 8 hours.  High-power apps like playing videos, or any app that needs the GPS chipset or the WiFi or Blue Tooth radios, will run the battery down much faster. Browsing the Internet - which means using WiFi, obviously - will use up the battery in about 3~4 hours, same for using any GPS app, so be sure to turn off the WiFi, Blue Tooth, and GPS when not actually needed.  The included charger will pump up an almost dead battery to 100% in about 4 hours, and a 50% battery in less than 2 hours, assuming the device is powered off. When actively running as a GPS Navigator, the power draw appears to be as much as 2 amps, maybe even a little more, as my ANKER USB 12 volt, 1.5 amp car charger can't quite keep up, and the tablet battery very slowly goes down, rather than charging back up, until I shut down the GPS app.\n\nSpeakers: As a music player, the built in speakers on this tablet are better than the ones on my old Samsung MP3 player, but not nearly as good as the speakers on some IPad tablets. You get what you pay for, and to be able to sell this talet for only $269, Samsung obviously had to save costs somewhere, and the barely-adequate speakers are one of the cost-savers, I guess. If you really want to listen to music or watch videos, you will have to plug in an external speaker or headphones.  The speakers are good enough, and actually quite clear, for the voice prompting of a GPS Navigation app, or whatever sound you set up for the Alarm clock app, they're just not quite good enough for real music listening.\n\nControls: The power on/off button on my copy of the tablet is actually hard to work. I usually have to press it with the edge of a coin, or something else hard and small. Maybe this is a deliberate design, so that it's not easy to power the device on or off with an accidental button press when you didn't intend to? The volume control and the \"home\" button are both easy and don't require excessive force.\n\nBuilt-in apps and widgets: There are a bunch of these, only a few of which I think I will ever use. The Polaris Office, Adobe Reader, Alarm Clock,  Memo Pad, Email, Google Play Store, Music Player, SPlanner (a calendar app), and the Camera app are all ones I've used. For a general purpose Internet browser, I installed Firefox, and for a calculator, I installed Droid48, an HP-48 Emulator. I also installed The Hacker's Keyboard, which is VERY nice, and gives you most of the functionality of a the QWERTY keyboard that you use with your regular computer, including arrow keys, and a Delete key in addition to the Backspace key. The only downside of this keyboard is that it's a little larger than the default Samsung keyboard, so it takes up more screen space, leaving you less to see what you are typing.\n\nSize, weight, and Form Factor: The Samsung 8\" weighs in at around 0.8 lb, about half the weight of the 10\" ASUS MemoPad and  Samsung tablets. It is too large to fit in a shirt pocket, but might fit in the side or back pockets of some blue jeans. It should easily fit in most any purse, fanny pack, backpack, briefcase, or coat pocket.\n\nScreen touch: The screen feels nice and smooth, like gorilla glass (I'm not sure if it actually is gorilla glass or not), The usual swiping, tapping and pinching motions all work as you would expect - with bare fingers, but not wearing gloves or mittens - and the screen is easy to clean with a damp cloth.\n\nCameras: The 5mp rear camera is okay, for if you ever really need to take a snapshot and don't have a real camera available, but there is no flash so it only works in daylight, or brightly lit indoor areas. The lens can focus on subjects as close as a 3\", so it's got some macro capability, and there is a 4x zoom function. I am not sure if this is an Optical or Digital zoom. Unfortunately, this camera app appears to be hard-coded to use a very heavy level of JPEG compression, and I have not been able to find a setting to change it. The files average 560kB, whereas 5 megapixel photos with \"light\" JPEG compression should be around 4 mB. This heavy level of compression means that photos with large areas of clear color, like sky, will show a lot of JPEG compression artifacts. The front facing 1 mp camera is very low quality.\n\nSUMMARY: A nice general purpose Android tablet computer with a medium-size screen. A good choice for someone who wants maximum functionality, but doesn't want the extra weight, higher price, and larger physical size of a 10\" model.\n\nUPDATE JULY 29, 2014: If your Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 came with Android v4.2.2 (Jelly Bean), I recommend that you stay on this version and do NOT accept the automatic update to Android v 4.4.2 (KitKat) that Samsung is pushing out.  KITKAT WILL CAUSE YOU MANY PROBLEMS, especially with Apps that store data on the external SD card.  Google made a significant change in KitKat that imposes a new layer of permissions on how Apps are allowed to access storage. For me, the worst effect was that as soon as I rebooted after installing KitKat, all of my GPS and Navigation apps stopped working, as they all store their maps off-line on the external SD card. I had to uninstall three apps, than download and re-install them, then download and re-install several gigabytes of map tiles. A MAJOR irritation that left me with no functional Navigation software for several days.  As far as I can tell, KitKat offers no noticeable improvements in the tablet's user interface, so from the User's point of view, it offers no benefit and will actually cause problems for you. Stay away - once you install Kit Kat, EVERYTHING on your external SD card is at risk: music, videos, documents, game stats, maps, etc. It's not that KitKat will actually erase these files, but the extra layer of \"permissions\" that it imposes on the external SD card will effectively render these files invisible to the apps they are associated with; to fix the problem, you will probably have to re-install the app from scratch, and may have to re-load it's data files from backup to reconstitute the association. Maybe not with music and photos, but that's what I had to do to get my Navigation apps working again.\n\nUPDATE August 5, 2014.  After months of frustration at not having Mass Storage Mode, I finally couldn't stand the thought of doing any more file transfers with MTP, and decided to Root the tablet and try out a Custom ROM that promised to give me Mass Storage Mode.  The first step, gaining Root access, was relatively simple: I had to install ROM Manager, SuperSU, TWRP Recovery, and a Root exploit I downloaded from the XDA Developers website. WARNING: The Root Exploit and TWRP packages have to be versions compiled specifically for your exact model device! Attempting to install any other version could \"brick\" your device.  So far, so good. After a little stumbling around and a couple of false starts, the installs were done, TWRP, SuperSU, and ROM Manager were running, and the Root Checker app said I had full Root access. So the next step was to download CyanogenMod.  Uh,Oh! This Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 (model SM-T310) Tablet isn't directly supported by the \"official\" CyanogenMod!  But I found a link to \"unofficial\" builds of CyanogenMod, done by volunteers for less popular devices. After a couple of hours of searching, I had located 4 different Custom ROM's that claimed to be for the Samsung SM-T310 8\" tablet. Also, at this point, I made a TWRP Full backup of the device. And I will be eternally grateful that I did, because NONE of the four Custom ROMS that I had downloaded would boot the tablet: all four caused unbreakable boot loops. After spending an entire weekend in ever increasing desperation, figuring that I had \"bricked\" my $279 tablet, I managed to revert the tablet back to the previous (stock Samsung) operating system from TWRP Restore. Of course I lost all the apps and had to re-install them, but my personal data was all safe on the external SD card so I didn't lose any of that.  Lessons learned: (1) Tablet computers have a lot of proprietary hardware in them unique to each brand - you MUST be sure that the Custom ROM you are installing was created and tested by Android-savvy techs, who actually know what they are doing, specifically for your model. (2) If your device isn't officially supported by CyanogenMod, it might be for a very good reason: that the Gurus at CyanogenMod simply could not find or create a Kernal that would work with your hardware. (3) Boot Loops are VERY common in tablets, especially Sumsung models, and I was very fortunate to have been able to recover from mine - many owners have irreparably bricked Samsung tablets while trying out Custom ROM's and Recovery programs, and had to junk them.  (4) After going through all of the above, I STILL don't have Mass Storage mode, and might never get it unless someone comes up with a build of CyanogenMod specifically for my tablet.\n\nUPDATE: July 16, 2015.  The Tablet has continued to function perfectly. I use it several hours every week, mostly as an e-book reader, car navigation device, and for general note-taking and listening to music. The battery is holding up well, and I expect to get at least a couple more years of service out of it. I also found a work-around (actually a Registry setting) that over-rides the stupid block that Google put on Android v4.4.2 that restricts  you from directly editing files on the external SD card. The URL for this fix is at: [http://trendblog.net/fix-kitkat-sd-card-write-restriction/]. NOTE: You have to have Root access to your tablet to make this Registry change.\n\nAlso, after nearly a year of waiting to see if an official build of CyanogenMod would come out for this tablet, it appears that there will be none. I have been anxiously awaiting this, as CyanogenMod does away with the \"bloatware\" that is bundled on the tablet when you buy it, and which you can't delete. I tried one of the \"unofficial\" CyanogenMod builds and at first it put the tablet into an infinite boot-loop, nearly bricking it. I then tried it again, making sure that a full factory reset and Dalvik Cache Delete had been done, and it worked. Unfortunately, I was under the impression that CyanogenMod includes Mass Storage Mode, and it does not.\n\nUPDATE: November 20, 2015. I think the battery is starting to wear out and lose charge capacity. It still powers the tablet for several hours when just reading an E-book, but if the WiFi and/or GPS services are switched on, the battery will drop from 100% to 30% in less than two hours, which indicates that the battery has lost maybe half it's charge capacity from when it was new. Other than that, everything else is still working well. At one point I was thinking of replacing the battery, but Samsung has a couple of newer 8\" tablets with WXGA screens (2560 x 1600 pixels) that only cost $320 and have much better performance thanks to a quad-core processor, and that have \"official\" builds of CyanogenMod available.\n\nUPDATE: July 9, 2016. The battery is definitely losing charge capacity, and I am starting to notice an occasional flicker on the screen, that I can't figure out what is causing it. If I was going to keep this tablet, I would be looking to replace the battery by the end of the year. However, I have decided to replace this tablet with a larger one, and have ordered a Galaxy Tab S 10.5, which has a dual quad-core processor, and double the screen resolution of this tablet. Of course, I will be paying much more for the Tab S, $470, but after 2+ years of ownership of the Tab 3 8.0, I really want a larger screen. That said, if you can get by with an 8\" screen, this is a nice tablet for $200 less than the 10.5\" Tab S. I have been running CyanogenMod on this tablet for about three months, and love it! It boots up fast, has a very clean UI that provides for a lot of customization, is automatically \"rooted\" (no need to root the tablet separately), and gets rid of all the useless bloatware that Samsung and Google put on."}

The hardware is mean, the software is familiar (because I have a Samsung phone) and overall it is a beautiful device.  Not too heavy.  Very thin.  Screen resolution is excellent.  The \"auto\" screen brightness is too low for my taste, so I have it set just under half brightness.  With this setting I get around 6 hours of non-stop use.  Bought the Samsung cover too, which I love.  If these tablets ever go on clearance I will buy a couple more."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I am very happy with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, 8 inch tablet! Things I use my tablet for on a regular basis: calendar, editing/creating documents on-the-go, internet, social media, notepad, email, youtube, watching some movies on-the-go. I had never used an Android device before so it took me some effort to learn it, but I expected that since I am used to the iPhone. Didn't get an iPad because of the price. Here are some things I learned that I wanted to share:\n\n1) Editing and Creating Microsoft documents:  In one of the reviews I read prior to buying my tablet, someone said they really liked Kingsoft Office (free app) and preferred it to the app that comes with the tablet. I took their advice, and I have been really happy with Kingsoft! Can't compare it to whatever comes with the tablet because I didn't use it, but Kingsoft Office is free, and I have been happy with it.\n\n2) Size: I considered getting a 10\" tablet, but I really wanted something that I could carry around in a smaller purse. And for my intended purposes, a smaller screen would be fine. I originally thought I would get a 7\". I am so glad I actually looked at screen sizes in a store because a 7\" is SO SMALL. I felt like it's just a giant phone. If you are worried about the same thing, GET THE 8 INCH! You wouldn't think an inch would make such a difference, but it really does.\n\n3) Rating: I only gave four stars because of the high price. I got mine on Amazon for 250 which is better than 300, but still kind of pricy. It is a good product though!\n\n4) Sync: I sync my calendar through Outlook on my computer, so I am able to get my calendar on my iPhone AND my tablet, but I may eventually try a galaxy phone so that I can sync everything between my tablet and phone.\n\n5) The touch buttons on either side of the \"Home\" button at the bottom of the tablet can be very annoying. I wish they would have built in a back button on the screen. When I'm holding the tablet sideways (for a bigger screen), I am always accidentally pushing the back button which is the looped arrow. It doesn't bother me enough to affect my rating or cause me to wish for a different tablet."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "Fantastic tablet.  Has the same look and feel as my Galaxy S4 phone and that's a good thing.  The 8 inch size is perfect for me.  The 7 inch tablets seem too narrow in portrait mode and the 10 inch tablets are too big and bulky especially when travelling.  There's only two things I would change. I would add a flash for the camera (more to use as a flashlight than to take pictures) and I would prefer to have the speakers on the front instead of the bottom.\n\nI had held off buying this tablet because I wanted to see what the new Tab Pro series was going to offer.  While the Pros do offer some performance advantages and extra features I didn't feel they justified the extra $150.  I probably should've waited a little longer as I just saw this tablet on sale for $50 less than I paid."}

The tablet is quite fast (processor wise) and easy to use, has access to some great apps, and even has the ability to control my Samsung TV! Streaming is also very fast. We linked the Nook account via app and now all my wifes books are accessible on here as well. I was impressed at the quality of movies on it, that I downloaded from Ultraviolet.\n\nThough I'm far from a tablet guru, I like this for what it does and the fact that I got it during a great offer makes it all that much better."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I had gotten one of these Samsung tablets for Christmas without having owned a tablet or an Android device. The experience of owning one for the first time was great. My problem happened about a week or less before I took it back to Costco. The battery on my brand new tablet device was bad. It stopped giving an accurate estimation of the battery life and stopped charging altogether. I tried different cables and outlets (it uses a universal USB cable) and it still would not charge. The battery ended up dying and I held the power button to see if it was really out of battery. It wasn't! It had 4x% battery remaining. It had to reboot to see the remaining energy. It's nice to know when my tablet is going to die and when it isn't. I plugged the tablet back in with its new 4x% and it still remained uncharged.\n\nNeedless to say, I returned it to get a new one. This one lasted about a month longer until I ran into the same battery issue. I plugged it in and it no longer charged. On top of that I had an issue where my screen went completely bonkers and wouldn't let me control anything (this was a one time thing, but it was interesting seeing my tablet rearrange itself).\n\nIs this device all bad? No.\nShould you buy a different tablet? Yes\n\nFinal comments:\nIt works as a device, but I'm unsure of how long it will last. The design is average having a few physical buttons and a couple touch screen buttons (which are pressed frequently by accident)"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "Coming from a Note 2 as my daily driver, the 8 inch size was the best option when looking for a tablet.  Since the Note 2 is already a larger phone, a 7 inch tablet doesn't really seem to be enough of a size difference to justify the purchase.  If you were coming from a smaller galaxy phone, it'd probably be fine.\nI picked this up preowned from Amazon for $150.  For that price, it's a great deal. Not sure I would have paid $249 for it considering there are certainly better tablets out there with higher res screens.  I did look at the Note 8 but decided against it as I already had a lot of that functionality in the phone.  I didn't think I needed a lot of that in the tablet.\nThe screen is nice, bright and colorful.  Pixel peepers may notice it's not a retina display (even the Nook has a higher res screen) but I honestly don't see it.\nThe Tab 3 is the perfect companion to the galaxy phone line up.  If you like the design and ecosystem that Samsung has created, you'll like the Tab 3.\nRegarding the purchase of a preowned product, I hadn't done this before via Amazon.  The item was listed \"used-very good.\" Other than the box clearly indicating that it had been opened before, the accessories and unit were like new.  They even had all of the plastic sheeting attached to the screen, buttons and borders.  If this was used before, I can't tell.  And I saved $100.  Nice job, Amazon."}

I have insomnia, so on those nights when I can't sleep, I just fire up my tablet and listen to an audiobook, browse online while I listen to online radio, go through family pictures or just whatever else of the million things you can do on this thing. It's amazing how such a tiny device can pack so much functionality.\n\nThe screen is crystal clear and pictures and videos look like a million bucks. The tablet is fast even when it's got a ton of apps installed and some of those running. You'll have to be careful not to overload the thing with apps, cause it's exciting to add more and more functions to your device and once you see the vast amount of free and paid apps out there, you become like a kid in a candy store and start downloading like a fiend.\n\nI was able to redeem at least SOME of the perks and gifts you get with the purchase of this tablet and that was surprising cause I'm located in South America. I missed out on a lot of perks because of it, but at least I redeemed Dropbox and Google Play's offers. Not to mention Audible's offer, which was highly surprising and welcome.\n\nThe built-in storage starts to fill up quickly if you're not careful, so I tried to move as many as the apps as I could, to the SD card. It ends up making a lot ofsense to get a high capacity MicroSD card, cause you'll definitely put it to good use when you want to carry videos, pictures, music and just any sort of file on your tablet, without filling up the built-in memory. It's a good and savvy investment, just like a good case and screen protectors are.\n\nIn short, I absolutely LOVE this tablet and I'm very happy I made the choice to get it. If nothing else, it allows you to get out of your room and be more in touch with your loved ones, instead of being couped up in the room where your desktop computer is. I don't like laptops, so this is the next best thing. I highly recommend this tablet."}

We opted for this one because the processor is better, and it's a bit more portable then then the bigger one.\n\nHe loves it. Everything is super fast, the internal memory (16GB) has enough room for all the apps and things without even rooting and swapping internal memory. The best part is that, being not a knockoff, I can actually fix this one if something goes wrong. Generic tablets cannot be rooted - I was not aware of this when I bought the knockoff.\n\nEven with the smartshell case (HIGHLY recommend), this one is lighter then the knockoff tablet which was 7in.\n\nIn all, a very nice tablet for about $100 less then best buy sells it for.

I was trying to find a decent tablet in this size without breaking the bank. A new iPad mini 64 GB is $700!! This Galaxy Tab 3 8in new was $250, a new 64 GB card was $45, giving me 80GB total memory for under $300. Not only does it have more memory available, but in my opinion, it is a better tablet.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "On November 1st, 2013 I purchased the new iPad Air and really enjoyed it.  However, I did not like the 10\" form factor and returned the unit.  Luckily, I was able to purchase the new iPad Mini with Retina display on its first day launch at the Apple Store on November 15th.  I was able to spend a good deal of time with this unit since it was in the \"holiday season\" and I was able to return it on January 6th.\n\nTo be honest, I absolutely loved both Apple products but it was somewhat of a hollow feeling as I really felt like I paid too much vs. the competition.  I don't mind paying a premium price for a premium product, but the iPads are no longer the only premium products in this space.\n\nSo, after almost 2 months with the Mini I purchased this Samsung Tab 3 8\".  Technically, it does not match the impressive spec sheet of the Mini with Retina.  But in real world performance (viewing videos, surfing the web, running applications, running games - from Candy Crush Saga to Asphalt 8, reading e-books and Flipboard magazines, etc.) there is actually no noticeable performance differences between this and the Mini with Retina with the exception that the Mini seemed to hold its charge a bit longer (about 1 extra hour).\n\nOddly, the Mini would stutter when I scrolled in the Facebook app whereas the Samsung does not.  Another odd thing about the Mini would be it would start Netflix videos in Standard Def then about a minute or two in switch to High Def.\n\nI don't mean to bash the Mini as it is a great product.  But I don't think it is worth 160 dollars more than this Samsung (I purchased mine at Costco for 239 vs. the 399 Mini).\n\nOn to the Samsung Tab 3 8\"...\n\nThe 16:9 aspect ratio screen is perfect for watching videos.  The screen is brilliant and stunning to look at ... more brilliant than the Mini even though the Mini has a higher resolution screen.\n\nThe camera has many more features and shooting modes than the Mini.  The Mini does shoot video in 1080p vs. Samsung's 720p.  Oddly enough, I actually prefer shooting video in 720p as it is still HD but the files are much smaller and easier to process on my MacBook Pro (using iMovie).\n\nAnother fantastic feature about this Sammy is that you can upgrade storage using micro SD cards.  I purchased one, here on Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-MicroSDHC-Memory-Adapter-SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-/dp/B009QZH7BU/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1391452164&sr=1-1&keywords=sandisk+ultra+32+gb), for 22 bucks - thus, increasing storage to 48 GB (16GB standard + 32GB card).  Apple charges $100 to upgrade Mini from 16GB to 32GB.\n\nAnother interesting thing is that the same apps on this device take up less space than on the Mini.  For example, the Facebook app on this is 44MB vs. over 300MB on the Mini.  Also, Asphalt 8 is only 27MB on this vs. 1.5GB on the Mini.  So, you very quickly use up storage on the Mini vs. this.\n\nI love the IR blaster on this tablet and use it to control all of the TV's/satellite in my home -- it's awesome!\n\nThe \"Cons\" of this tablet are: the back and menu buttons on the bottom can be mistakenly hit when you don't mean to push them ... this can be very frustrating when watching a movie or playing a game, then suddenly the movie/game stops because of an errant back button touch.\n\nMy only real wish for this tablet is that it lacks (as almost all tablets do) a LED flash for the back camera.  Unlike the popular consensus that \"why should a tablet have a camera anyways?\", I completely disagree.  Sure with a big 10\" tablet it looks odd taking a pic or video, but with a smaller 7-8\" tablet it really is quite nice/easy to frame shots/video and playback of the pics/videos in this larger size (vs. phone) is awesome for all who view it.\n\nFor the price and performance, I love this tablet."}

The spot looked like when you push in on an LCD screen. I exchanged that one and the 3rd one finally arrived and is working perfectly.

I about wore out all the cyber ink in my computer monitor going from site to site, utube to utube, getting as much information on the available Tablets.  In the end, the choice for me, was clear.  The Galaxy Tab3 8 inch was a perfect fit for my needs.\nIt's very quick, settings and controls are easy to get to.  Movies and videos are billiant on it's display.  Love the WiFi software.  Click the wifi on, and it connects in the blink of an eye, with a strong signal.\nI've downloaded all the apps that I intend to use, have transferred a couple of movies, and utube videos, along with taking lots of pictures and a few videos with the camera, and I still have about half the storage space available.  I will eventually buy a sd card, but it won't be needed for some time.\nGoogle maps and Google earth work amazingly well on this device.  I've been using this tablet for about 2 months, and believe me, being retired,  I've USED it.\nI've found that I get a full day of heavy use out of the battery before it needs to be recharged.  (I recharge when it gets down to 30%)\nI'm just delighted with this tablet.  The 8 inch size is the perfect compromise as far as I'm concerned.  It's light and mobile,  and has my laptop sits idle.  The only time I've used my laptop since I bought this tablet, was to hook it up and charge it a couple of times.\nTrying to present a balanced review, the only \"con\" I can offer, is that the placement of the speaker on the side sometimes causes the sound to muffle because my hand is in the way.  However, that's easily fixed by simply moving the position of my hand, or using headphones."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "Let me start with some background. For the last few years, I've had an iPad 2 and an iPhone. I'd been mostly happy with these products, but when my phone went off contract, I decided to mix things up. I moved to a Galaxy S3, and once I became comfortable with it, I realized it was an awesome device. This led me to become a bit less tolerant of the iPad's shortcomings, and I started to look at Android tablets. I settled on the Galaxy Tab 3.0 8\", which I bought today. It was with much excitement that I unboxed it and began trying to fine tune it for my use.\n\nFirst up, find a browser that I like. I operate primarily from the browser, preferring web sites over individual apps. On my iPad, I use Atomic Web, which looks and feels like a desktop browser. It's highly customizable, and, importantly to me, has an always visible bookmark toolbar. Much to my surprise, I could not find one Android browser that has an always visible bookmark toolbar. I use my tablet an hour or three every day, and I'm in the browser 95% of the time. This is just about a deal breaker for me.\n\nDeciding to move on, I installed the app for reading my local newspaper. I read the paper daily on my iPad, and the app works well. The Android version of the app is unusable.\n\nSo, I'm now 0 for 2 getting my new tablet up. These are the primary reasons I have a tablet, and I can't make them work. I decided that this device isn't for me, and I'm returning it tomorrow. I guess the silver lining is, I have a greater appreciation of what the iPad 2 does well.\n\nToo bad though, I was really excited to get this tablet, and I really wanted to like it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "We have had an Ipad 2 for almost two years and I have become fed up with Apple's approach to locking down the operating system. I decided to go with Android. I looked at all of the Android tablets and kept coming back to Samsung.\n\nI initially bought a Galaxy Tab 3 7 inch. The first one had defective home button so I exchanged it. I used the GT3-7 for a few days and wasn't satisfied. I found it to be sluggish and the screen was just too small. The next week,  the 8 inch GT3 went on sale at a local big box store for $70 off the list price,  just $30 more than the 7 inch. So I traded the 7 for an 8. What a difference! Better operating system, better screen,  faster processor,  etc.\n\nThe GT3-8 is very fast, smooth and easy to use.  Web browsing is very pleasant because the screen is so crisp. I find that I can read many websites without my glasses, when I need the glasses to read the same sites on the Ipad 2.\n\nOne factor that makes this a winner over the ipad is the SD expansion slot.  I don't know why Apple thinks 16 gb is all anyone will need in an affordable tablet. And they want to charge you an extra $100 for every additional 16 gb. I added 16 gb to my GT3 for $15. If I need more, I can easily add 64 GB for less than $100.\n\nThe IR blaster was an unexpected bonus. We use the Smart Remote app and it has pretty much replaced our old remotes, plus finding shows is so much easier using this app than the cruide guides provided by cable systems.\n\nBattery life is at least as good with this tablet as it is with the ipad. I can get more than 8 hours of heavy use with no problems.\n\nI am now an Android convert.  I have used PCs for 25 years and I like to have the ability to move files, etc. using an explorer. Again, Apple seems to think I should not be able to look under the hood of my device,  while Android opens it up for anyone who wants it. Moving files from a PC to this device is as easy as connecting the usb cable and away you go.\n\nI am also finding the predictive keyboard to be a time saver. It seems to learn your writing style and improves over time.  I am much faster on this tablet than on the Ipad. No doubt you can get better keyboard apps for the ipad,  but this feature was built in with the GT3.\n\nThe Google play store has everything I need. I downloaded Kingsoft Office as I find it better than Polaris,  which shipped on the GT3. This tablet is very easy to use for reading work documents,  pdfs, etc.\n\nThe only downsides I've found with this tablet are\n- the capacitive back and menu keys are easy to touch accidentally,  but you get used to working around them. And Ive found that having the back key always under your thumb is actually very convenient most of the time.\n- there isn't much of a selection of cases for the GT3-8. If you have an Ipad,  there are hundreds,  but only a few for this unit.  That's not a fault of Samsung,  but it is a downside.\n\nThe upsides are many,  a few of which I have listed above. But the bottom line is that this is the best tablet I have found for the money.  It looks great, works fantastic and seems to be built to last.  If you are looking for a tablet in this size range,  don't waste your money on the Ipad mini.  Buy the GT3-8. You won't regret it."}

I have not had a single problem with it. I can watch videos, read, check my email, browse. I don't regret the purchase.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nUpdate\nAbout a month ago I tried charging the tab but there was no indication that power was reaching the device. I changed the charger a couple times and tried changing the charging source from the electrical outlet on the wall to the PC via a USB cord. I restarted it, this did not work either. I tried 'googling' the problem and after two or three words google had auto-completed the problem.....I wasn't the only one having the same issue with a Samsung device. I saw and tried several fixes. The one that eventually worked was re-setting the device - which annoyed me because I had to wait for all the apps to be re-installed. This I had to make sure was done while I had a wifi connection in order for me to access my offline apps when I am not able to receive a wifi connection.\n\nAfter thinking that the problem was solved, it happened a week later. I did the same re-set and it worked, again. After a little over another week, it happened again, except this time the re-set didn't work. I found another fix online that recommended holding down the power+volume buttons at the said simultaneously. I have had to do that about 3 times since the first fix stop responding. Holding down the buttons have been working so far. But sometimes I think the speed at which it is charged moves a bit slow.\n\nIt's such a shame that I have to downgrade my 5 star rating because I really like the look, feel and operation of the device. But a faulty charging issue is way past annoying to say the least..it's poor. I gave it 2 stars because 3 stars means 'it's OK' and it's not."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "Perhaps my unit was a lemon, but I can only speak from my experience.  This is coming from a PC-owner (an HP laptop running on Windows 8, jumping to this from XP), and an iPod Touch 4(first and only Apple product) owner. So, setting up a device under different types of platforms is not a completely new concept to me (though I'll admit, I'm no expert). However, family and friends usually come to ME for help when they have computer tech issues.\n\nI was pushed into purchasing the Galaxy instead of the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" at a local store by a rep for Samsung working inside said store. I should have sensed a problem because the first time I went into the store after Christmas, the Samsung reps were swarming over the tablet section pushing their product over the Kindles, iPads, and Google Nexus tabs. (They get a commission, and each claims to own a Samsung tablet with which they are thrilled, which I suspect they get for a deep discount. It makes sense they are less than objective.) So sadly, I caved from my original intention when I entered the store, and came home with the Galaxy.\n\n(As a side note:  I've noticed the bad reviews on this device are getting a \"not helpful\" vote on them, which makes me suspect many votes are from Samsung reps who are working on commission, based on the attitudes and behaviors of the reps I saw in the electronics store.)\n\nI regretted my purchase within an hour of turning it on, setting it up, and starting to download apps when I got home. The download time was slower than molasses even with my broadband WiFi connection, and the interface was cluttered and confusing on the tablet.  Trying to group apps into folders was confusing at best.\n\nFor those people who would say I just didn't get used to Android because Apple had \"spoiled\" me, let me say that the Kindle uses Android, but Amazon makes the setup process and UI much easier to navigate. Perhaps Android could take some lessons from both Amazon and Apple.\n\nPhysically, I'd also say that owning a case for this is a MUST. It's way too thin to hold comfortably, the back is slick and tends to heat up on one side too much while charging, which can cause your hands to sweat and have a moist and slippery environment with your equipment (not a good combo at all for electronic devices that you want to last). I also found this device uncomfortable to hold in one hand because of its size. The weight is distributed across the device such that holding with one hand can be difficult, and would especially be for anyone with small hands.\n\nLet me give some positives on the device, which had convinced me to buy it over the Kindle to start with:\n1. Expandable memory with MicroSD card.\n2. Multi-window App Accessibility.... (NOTE: It only works with CERTAIN pre-installed apps on the device, NOT every app you install. This was not revealed by the rep who sold the device to me. I thought it worked with everything, much like my split-screen functionality of my Windows 8 laptop.)\n3. Screen-mirroring (which could only be used with purchase of additional $70 device to hook up to TV, etc.) The rep claimed that the Kindle Fire HDX did not have this, but upon getting the Fire, I learned that the Fire DOES have this ability under the Settings menu, called \"Display Mirroring... same thing.\n4. 5MP rear camera\n\nHowever, all the great features in the world don't mean squat if you can't get the equipment to work. When you can't download apps because they are loading at a snail's pace, and when you try YouTube and Netflix to have them buffer every 10 seconds (tried even at 2AM, when no one else was using our Internet connection), it's clear you have a slow piece of overpriced electronic equipment. It took deleting all but 3 apps on the tablet to get YouTube to even work without immediately buffering.\n\nMulti-tasking on this device is difficult because of the processor speed. It doesn't run other apps well if you are downloading something in the background. It simply doesn't have the processor speed or RAM to support it, so don't expect to download an app in the background while trying to play a game. It won't be pretty.\n\nSo great was my frustration that I returned it to the store within 24 hours and bought what I had originally intended to get in the first place for $70 less... the Kindle Fire HDX 7\" (purchased on sale for $199).  My experience with the Kindle has been like day versus night in comparison to the Galaxy with setup and UI. The speed outshines Samsung by miles (compare a 2.2GHz quad-core processor with 2GB RAM in the Kindle HDX to a 1.5GHz dual-core and 1.5GB RAM in the Galaxy, and you will notice a HUGE difference). I have had the Kindle for 3 days now, and have not had a problem yet.\n\nBased on my experience, in my opinion, Samsung should stick to producing TVs and BluRay players and stay out of the tablet business. If you'd like to see my more detailed review and comparison with the Kindle Fire HDX, look here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R27WLATCO02ZHD/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm (which I'm not being paid or compensated for... just a pleased owner/user)."}

So in the process of helping her learn the apple way of doing things I begin to like the mini ipad. Keep in mind I despise apple. I bought an ipod and right off the bat they wanted $$60 to complete some warranty work.  A few other little incidents and me and apple were done. So when the tab 2 came along I liked it. It was easy to set up and use and there was a phone number I could call for immediate help. I took it with me everywhere and it became indespinseable. After the broken screen I had to think about what I wanted next so i settled on the tab 3 8.0. Oh what a mistake that was. My prior accounts wouldn't work, the thing has a mind of its own and of course my tab 3 is stuffed with crapware I don't want. Maybe thats why it only cost apple around $7 per unit to produce. Anyway just trying to sign into my accounts has taken 9 hours a day for the past week and a half. I finally found a support phone number and after he tried to reset the accounts it didn't work so he asked if I could wait for a higher level of support. At this point he said he set up a call back and they would get right with me. Well its 7 hours later and no call back. Bottom line I  hate this piece of trash and will send it back for a refund. Avoid this tablet at all cost is my opinion. Head to head you get every thing you want on the mini ipad and you have access to all the same apps. By the way the tab3 doesn't do video if that is one of your expectations regardless of what other users tell you."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "First, let me say I love my Galaxy Tab 3 8.0. It closely resembles my Galaxy S5 smartphone, but even thinner with almost three times the screen space. Web surfing is far peppier than with Kindle Fire's wretched Silk browser. I typically have 65% power at the end of the day even though I use it for web surfing, email, Netflix, Kindle and Nook books, full-length movies, mp3, Facebook and tons of other \"stuff.\" It contains front and rear facing cameras of low to medium resolution, but sports a brilliant sharp screen. Road warriors can find inexpensive Bluetooth keyboard/case combinations.\n\nOne of the Galaxy Tab's biggest benefits is that marvelous microSD slot that is missing from most tablets--I mean YOU, Kindle Fire and overpriced iPad! You can load 64 GB of movies, mp3, books, documents and other media to avoid clogging the tablet's resources. The Samsung micro SDXC UHS-1 PRO 64GB Class 10 card works perfectly without formatting. You can even use a thumb drive by attaching an OTG (On The Go) connector.\n\n--MINOR QUIBBLES--\n\nThe two speakers on the bottom produce decent volume, but I wish they had placed them at the top/bottom (left/right) for better stereo separation. A bigger negative is that there are NO charging or email notification or white light LEDs; the unit is a blank slab until powered up.\n\nI received my Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 from Amazon in just two days, but experienced a couple of unpleasant surprises when I opened the package. First, the Samsung box was torn open at both ends! Even though there is a big warning sticker not to accept the device if the seal is broken, I decided to risk it and see if it worked.\n\nI plugged it in and pressed the power button, but my heart sank when nothing happened. I kept mashing the button, waiting for the screen to flicker, when suddenly the musical boot tone sounded. Surprise! It turns out that the transparent-looking plastic screen covering is actually opaque black plastic! It looks just like a blank screen. Huh--a rather poor packaging idea, IMO.\n\nThe minimal instructions and box are printed on crummy brown recycled paper about the color and texture of old cardboard. Luckily you can find the real manual in .pdf form on line.\n\nThen it took me FOREVER to find the darn serial number so I could register. Turns out the serial number is printed on the label of the box that tears when you open it. D'oh! You get a bunch of freebies if you register, but most are junk.\n\n--FINALLY--\n\nI connected to my WiFi in seconds with a maxed-out signal. There was a big firmware upgrade available bringing it up to Android version 4.2.2. Sweet!\n\nLightweight, slim and powerful at at a modest price, the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 earns a solid five stars! If I ever have an issue with this device, I will immediately update this review.\n\nUPDATE: After nine months of heavy use, my Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is still working perfectly. Plus they updated the firmware up to Android version 4.4.2. An excellent and affordable tablet."}

Although the screen display in the Kindle, iPad and Nexus are great neither of these let you expand storage via SD card.

The processor is decently fast and the build is pretty nice. Cons: you can get a much nicer screen for cheaper on the nexus 7. The screen is decent on movies and videos but you can easily see the pixels. And watching cartoons like family guy are almost unbearable because all of the lines are blurry. Another flaw is the buttons next to the home button, they are very sensitive and their placement makes it very difficult to hold the tablet in landscape mode without accidentially hitting them.

Honestly, I can't comprehend how bad this thing is that it does not work.\n\nI'm sorry, if I've offended those who've drunk the Samsung Kool Aid but it's getting sent back to the factory. Hopefully, all it was was a defective model. If not, Samsung is toast in my opinion. After all, my bro has had trouble with his Samsung phone not once but twice and switched to a Kyocera model so...gotta say not looking good at all, Sammy.\n\nFinally, because this was a Xmas present, we gave up and went out shopping day after Boxing Day and picked up an iPad Mini to appease everyone.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU ARE GOING TO HOLD THE THING!\n\nAfter two days of trying to like this tablet, I decided that I've had enough.\n\nThere is a real home button at the bottom, which works well. There is also a BACK button and MENU button, which don't work fine.\n\nActually they work too fine. Because they are capacitive and not real buttons (like the home button is), just touching the bottom of the tablet almost anywhere triggers one of these buttons. The BACK button will take you back when you don't want to, and the menu button will sometimes pop up a menu, but more often pops up a search box over the entire screen.\n\nTouching the MENU button again makes the search box go away, but I've had enough. A HUGE waste of my time that makes using this tablet very frustrating. EVERY TIME I USE IT!\n\nI didn't buy the case for it initially. But I ordered some cases, so maybe holding it by the case will help?\n\nOther than that the tablet works OK. It's light and thin. The screen looks great. It's pretty fast and has a built-in GPS that works OK. The sound is pretty loud. Scrolling on the screen is smooth.\n\nBut hitting one or the other capacitive buttons ...once or twice EVERY minute... while holding this thing makes it useless for me.\n\nI have a Galaxy Tab 7.0 (the original) that just didn't want to run most new programs (they aren't even offered in the play store because the tablet is so old), so I bought this tablet. The original Tab has four capacitive buttons along the bottom, but I didn't have the problem with them. You have to touch right on the actual icon.\n\nOn the Tab 8 you can touch anywhere around the button. It has a bubble sound when you touch one of those \"buttons\" so you know you just screwed up.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a setting for how sensitive the button is. I don't have a samsung phone which I understand this is a copy of. Maybe it's not an issue on a phone because you normally hold it in portrait mode. I always hold a tablet in landscape mode.\n\nUPDATE: The three cases I've tried didn't help much. Samsung can fix this if they program the buttons to be less sensitive, or require that the button be touched for half a second. But they don't seem to care.\n\nThis is the LAST Samsung product I'm going to buy. It is UNUSABLE if you have to hold it in your hands in landscape (portrait is essentially impossible because of the tiny edges before the screen starts, you keep touching something on the screen).\n\nIf you leave it on a desk or glued to a wall, and never try to pick it up, it's OK."}

I can go right down the list of problems I have had with different tablets, and this tablet has solved each one of them.\n\nTo begin with, standby battery is extremely good. I can leave this unplugged all night, with wi-fi off, and it will be at 99% battery in the morning.  Also, since it has 1.5 GB of RAM, you have enough room to run 20 apps at the same time.\n\nI had the original Nexus 7 and it ran great until the first Android update. Now I have to restart it once a day. Not this one.  I have several tablets and about 5% of the apps that I want will not load, saying that the app is not compatible with this device.  100% of the apps I want that won't load on other tablets will load on this one. Another thing, on the original Nexus 7 the microUSB for charging is too loose, and one cannot charge it while you are using it. Here, it is nice and snug and easy to charge while using.\n\nOne nice little touch.  If you are in a field to log in with your email address, it can remember email addresses (plural) and suggest them, so you don't have to enter the whole thing.\n\n10 inch tablets are too big for me, but this handles as well as a 7 inch tablet but with extra screen space.\n\nThe only thing I wish was different was the traditional Samsung launcher displays apps in chronilogical order.  I simply use an alternate launcher to solve that problem and to get them in alpha order.\n\nI really think this tablet is great. 5 stars does not do it justice."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I'm technical and very selective when it comes to technology purchases.  Before buying I did side-by-side comparisons of the Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 against other tablets at two major chain stores.  The Tab 3, with its beautiful colors, resolution and responsiveness came out virtually on the top.  I was unsure whether to get the 7\" or 8\" screen, but holding both size tablets near each other and looking at the NY Times website, there's a clear and distinct difference - the 8\" screen being a lot sharper and more readable, even across different brands of tablets.  As others have written 8\" is probably the sweet spot in the tablet market.  Prior to buying this, I've been using my wife's iPad Mini for the past year and did like it.  However, now using the Tab 3 8.0 and the Mini side-by-side, I definitely like the Tab 3 better and it's liberating to feel free of the myriad of Apple's hardware and software conditions and restrictions.  In fact, I'd take the Tab 3 8.0 over any current iPad model.  The Tab 3 is a joy to use; it just feels alive."}

With the Mega, I probably don't need the Tab 3 but I want both. The cell phone has a monthly charge attached for services as all cell phones have. Can't make calls with the Tab 3? There is Skype and video chats. The Mega has a 6.3\" screen which is fantastic. Large for a cell phone but although I'm on the small side with small hands, it doesn't pose any problems for me. I always use a bluetooth headset anyway. So I say...Buy the Tab 3 and/or the Mega. You will not be sorry in the least."}
{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I bought this for general internet access and quickly looking up information when travelling-- maps, timetables, travel itineraries, travel notes, viewing and then uploading photos to internet from a micro-sd card, etc.  I had hoped this device was an upgrade from the previous Galaxy Tab 2.0 7 I previously had and in some ways it was.  It had double more storage space, much better finish and materials, and the screen was much brighter and noticeably bigger.\n\nI don't ask for much from this device as far as performance and the relatively slow galaxy tab 2 I owned worked fine for me and this should have been a performance upgrade.  However, the touchscreen is completely unresponsive or completely misses touch inputs when coming out of the sleep state sporadically for several minutes.  After several minutes it generally runs smoothly, but I do catch it stuttering when scrolling through a web page or clicking on an icon for example.\n\nAs I have some information on it I wanted to keep secure while travelling, I have a strong alphanumeric password and consistently takes me 4-10 tries over several minutes to successfully log into the device. I would be able to enter one or two characters, then the next keypress would be totally lost and would take maybe a dozen tries or so of hitting the same key until the keypress finally was detected.  It would often time out and go back to sleep because I couldn't finish entering a password in the allotted time, or because I didn't notice that a keypress was lost or that two were entered instead of one.  And then I'd have to try and unlock again, over and over.\n\nThis is odd because it senses changes in orientation and flips to landscape/portrait immediately.  So it appears to be a touchscreen specific issue?  Different keyboards and shutting down unneeded background services didn't seem to help.\n\nLast but not least, the design appears to make it easier to break the glass when dropped on its corner.  The glass is surrounded by only by the metal band around the edge of the tablet and appears to have transmitted the impact of a 2 foot drop at the corner onto the concrete floor to the glass, even when it was protected by a case.  Be sure that any case you get provides some actual cushioning to the corners...\n\nWithout the touchscreen issues, I'd give this device 4-5 stars as it is fairly fast, has a nice screen, and works well otherwise but there are so many times I'd like to use this device right away and would instead end up trying to log in for several minutes.  Hopefully the glass is easy/inexpensive to repair as well."}

On the Tab 7 it has more contrast and as you raise and lower the light\nlevel the contrast and brightness maintain their levels.  This is NOT the case with the Tab 3 8  only the brightness goes up SO yes as you turn up the brightness it does create more light but only the brightness is being effected so the the brighter you get the more washed out the picture.  This is a huge screw up!  I much prefer the picture of the 7 and wish the 8 was as good.\n\nAlso they have dumbed down the blue tooth capability of the blu tooth on the Tab 3 8,  forget watching any movies or tv shows using blue tooth speakers cause the lag is ridiculous.  Netflix impossible, purchased movies on your device will be better but never seem to be dead on.\n\nI wish Samsung would somehow realize just cause the customer would like a larger screen doesn't mean he or she wants to sacrifice picture quality and blu tooth capability as a trade off.  Make the thing right, have it work properly and if you have to charge a little more fine!  but stop making it an either or situation.  For my purposes the Tab 7 across the board works the way it is suppose to.  When I shell out $400 for EU Boom Stereo blu tooth speakers it's insane that Samsung decided go to an inferior blu tooth technology to not keep up with the times.  GET WITH IT SAMSUNG!"}

This piece of JUNK tablet died after only 2 weeks of use. Not what you would expect from a product that cost nearly $300. The battery life completely depleted; I plugged it into the wall charger and nothing happened, no signs of life at all, usually displays image of battery charging. Prior to this device's death, I charged the tablet when there was still a little battery life left or when it alerted me 20% or 10% of battery remaining. Who would have thought EMPTY BATTERY = DEAD TABLET! KEEP CHARGED AT ALL TIMES! Samsung should have that WARNING printed in large bold font in their manual with instructions that state HOW TO RESURRECT YOUR TABLET. After reading other reviews, this seems to be a common problem with the Galaxy Tab 2 & 3, 7-inch tablets as well. I did my research prior to purchase but thought I'd take the chance since the Pros outweighed the Cons. My cheap Chinese Allwinner tablet lasted longer than this before my daughter sat on it and cracked the screen, making it totally unusable but I wouldn't purchase that again either; in short, cheap plastic body, delayed touch-screen, compatibility and updating issues. My son is totally heartbroken over this dead Tab 3, it was his birthday present. Now I must waste my time returning this garbage and continue my pursuit in finding the perfect affordable tablet. I may even shell out the extra cash for Apple's Mini iPad. Although pricey, at least it's a reliable product that works with support available through any Apple Store."}

Samsung has succeeded in surpassing ASUS/Nexus in design and implementation. At first the first-release Jellybeans were welcomed on my Nexus, until they bogged the speed down to a crawl. There is something about the aspect-ratio on this tablets brilliant screen that simply makes reading and videos BETTER... all of this while still fitting comfortably in my hand. This tablet was completely ergonomically designed from the previous model to make for a comfortable experience. The SD-slot will come in handy if this tablet is used to entertain kids traveling in a car, when a streaming WiFi signal is not available."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I'm not going to repeat everything that other reviewers have indicated, however I would like to make a few points:\n\n1.  I did considerable research comparing this device to the Nexus 7. The key benefit of the Nexus 7 was that it had significantly higher screen resolution.  That said, I could see no perceptible difference with the naked eye.  The Galaxy Tab 3 - 8.0 does have a 1\" screen size advantage, but I am accustomed to the 7\" screen on the original Kindle Fire, so that might not have made a big difference.  Feature for feature with the exception of these two items the devices were comparable. Free BOINGO WiFi hotspots are a significant bonus on the Galaxy along with 2GB of DropBox.\n\n2.  I had purchased an original Kindle Fire, pre-ordered when they were first introduced.  Initially I was totally enamored with it, but very soon after that I became disenchanted.  It was underpowered and the screen was very sluggish to respond. For some reason, the virtual keyboard was very flaky.  The worst part however was that since it was a NON-STANDARD ANDROID, many of the apps that I use daily were simply not available:  Weight Watchers Mobile, Candy Crush Sage and many others.  Every issue I ever had with the KF has been resolved with the new Galaxy.\n\n3. The Galaxy arrived two days sooner than promised (Yay!) and it took all of five minutes to set up.  All I had to do was make a few minor adjustments to sound, home screen wallpaper and notification preferences, and then I logged into my Google account (which is also on my Motorola Razr Droid, and presto, every app on my Razr was instantly installed on my Galaxy.  All I had to do was decide which shortcuts I wanted on the several different homescreen pages.  I expected to be downloading apps for days, and it was all done for me.\n\n4.  I've been using it for two days now, and I haven't discovered one hiccup, and quite frankly, I don't expect any.  Samsung has done a phenomenal job on this device.\n\nI will never purchase a non-standard Android like the KF again.  That was by far my worst mistake ever.\n\nAlso note that at least on current sale pricing, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 is $20 less than the Google (Asus) Nexus 7.  Not a major difference when you are talking $250 to $270, but if you are concerned about price, you can get the Galaxy Tab 3 7\" for significantly less."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "This is one of the best tablets I've worked with and I've worked with a few (various Chinese tablets, Galaxy tab 2, ipad mini).  The screen is clear and watching movies that are rich for pictures (ie Avatar) the picture really pops.  The speakers are loud enough to not need headphones or other external speakers.  Using the Nook or Kindle apps is nice for ereading.  I can listen to audible books or use the Overdrive app to download free audio and ebooks from my local library.  It is lightning quick and connects easily to my home internet.  The 8 inch screen is perfect, not too small or too big.  I can hook up an external USB keyboard case or bluetooth keyboard with no problem.  I have used the remote control function, but still prefer to use the remotes that came with my devices.  The difference between the Tab 2 7 inch and this one is night and day.  The Tab 3 is faster, brighter, and Samsung got rid of the proprietary plug.  Now I can use the same charger for my phone and tablet and eliminates the need for more cables hanging around.  I can sync easily between my tab 3 and S3 phone.  The screen is nicer than the first generation ipad mini.  I love the freedom Android allows to personalize your home screen and that you can use different home launchers.  The most popular apps have caught up with Android, so most apps that you can find in the Apple App store, you can find on Google Play.  You can also have multiwindows opened at the same time and I love that you can minimize a movie you are watching and still surf the web at the same time.  Skype video is clear and I can clearly hear the other person.  I would recommend this tablet to anyone who wants a tablet in the $250 price range."}

On high cpu usage aps like the game Osmos HD, the battery will actually loose some charge even while plugged in!\n\nI do like the size, how vivid the screen is, but I would like to suggest that all reviewers drop a star on any devive whose bloatware knocks back battery life, in addition to using the cpu and device memory. You need to know how to \"root\" a tablet, before you can remove those programs you didn't ask for, which update all the time, or remind you to update all the time.\n\nKindle gives us the option to have adverts or pay an extra $20 to drop them. I would gladly pay $20 to get rid of 5 programs I will nener use, it is frustrating and for my next tab purchase I will be watching for mentions of this."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "This tablet is exactly what I was looking for, in size, ease of use, clarity, features, and speed. It was almost overwhelming, trying to decide which tablet to buy. The deciding factor for me was that I already use a Samsung Galaxy S4 phone, and this tablet is very similar to the phone. The buttons, icons, menu, and apps were all very familiar, so it was very easy to learn how to use the tablet. I love how simple and quick it is to accomplish tasks that you adjust and readjust often, such as WiFi, Bluetooth, SafeStay, or Airplane Mode). Like the Galaxy S4, it has some extra features that are just for show. I mean, it's almost annoying to have a tablet or phone that reacts to where you move your eyes. And the tablet's \"virtual assistant\" (substitute Siri) is fun to experiment with, but it's faster and easier to just get the jobs done yourself, using the internet or the phone's features. Voice recognition and mind reading still have a long way to go. Size-wise, the 8-inch format is perfect. That extra inch makes a world of difference, but doesn't make the tablet unwieldy. Battery life is decent, recharging is fast. Watching movies and TV is fun (note: to watch Amazon videos, download Maxthon Browser), and the sound quality is fine. Downloading pdf files is occasionally slow, but it gets the job done.  Last thing:  If you're a student, think about getting the Samsung Galaxy Note. It's more expensive, but seems like a great tablet for using in class.\n\nUpdate 12/1/2013:  I've dropped my review from 5-stars to 4 because it seems that a common problem with the Tab 3 is that the battery fails to charge and you have to jump through a few hoops to solve the problem. When I noticed that charging my tablet overnight only got me a 42% charge, I went online to find out why. First suggestion was to \"restart\" it by unplugging it, holding the power button for 30 seconds, and then plugging it back in. This worked and I got a 100% charge in a couple of hours. But I'm worried it seems to be losing its charge faster than it has in the past. Over the past few months that I've had it, it would stay charged overnight. Now, it seems to be draining the battery while it sits, in resting mode. If this continues, my next step is to call Samsung tech support, and then possibly send it back to them for them to look at and hopefully fix. It's still under its 12-month limited warranty, so I'll see how it goes and get back with updates later."}

I tried to break away from Apple and after reading the AMZN reviews the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8\" seemed really solid. How wrong I was!\nHowever, here are the reasons I give it 2 stars:\n1) BATTERY LIFE IS TERRIBLE.  I would leave mine over night with 90% charge, bluetooth off, battery saving mode off, most apps shut down and it would be dead the next morning. A 30 min run on the treadmill watching a movie would kill 20% of the battery.  Compared to iPad Mini - you will go a solid 10 hours no questions.\n2) Usability for kids - nowhere near that of the iPad.\n3) Overall usability - weak.\n4) Playing movies directly to my new Samsung Smart TV was very clunky and it would crash every 5 mins!!!\n\nI moved to Android because I loved the idea of open apps (which are wonderful) and the SD card expansion slot (which is a HUGE +) - but the device itself currently is far inferior to the iPad.\n\nI just returned it today after a solid 2 week test drive. I lost out on a new case I bought and a screen protector.... but that is the price I paid.  Back to buy another iPad Mini. Just wish it did not cost $100 for every 16GB - that is a rip off and Apple should be ashamed."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "So I did pretty exhaustive research on the \"mini tablet\" market. The Galaxy Tab 3.0 8\" was a prime contender. I looked at the Nexus 7 and the Kindle Fire HDX as well, but I settled on the Samsung given that I'm a Samsung fan (Galaxy S / Galaxy S3 phones).\n\nAs usual, Amazon shipping / order process was great. When I got the Tab, it was ~60% charged which was nice. Everything worked well and started loading apps. But pretty quickly I realized a few issues.\n\nScreen: first, the resolution on the screen wasn't that great. Clearly the PPI rating isn't very high (189ppi) as compared to my smartphone (Galaxy S3 is >300ppi). That said, website text wasn't great in smaller font sizes. Color and brightness on the other hand were great.\n\nProcessor: I expected much more fluidity based on prior reviews, but it seemed pretty \"laggy\" (if that's a word). Once again, my 1.5 year old smartphone was much more fluid. I had hardly installed any apps, so not sure what the issue might have been.\n\nAll-in-all, it seemed like a solid tablet and probably lives up to its specs. I decided to return it and wait for the next generation. As always, the return process w/Amazon was first rate."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "Ok, first of all, I just received the tablet a day ago but ......... I LOVE IT! The size and weight are great for reading making it an excellent Kindle stand-in and the speed and sharp (of course) Samsung display make it an excellent browser. Speed of apps is very good. Set up was ... maybe a little bit involved but pretty straight-forward. I streamed a few samples from Amazon Prime and the playback was very good. Sound and speakers are good as well, not audiophile good but definitely loud and clear enough. But mostly, I am very very satisfied with the size and weight. I was hoping that an 8\" tablet would be the proper compromise between a smaller 7\" or Kindle and  a larger 10\" Android or iPad. [Though, for me, pricing of the iPad doesn't make it a real option ... too expensive for the purposes I will use it for. plus I find that they are also still fairly heavy for general purposes like reading.]\n\nThis unit's weight and size seem to be just right for my urban commuting reading needs. I'm still working on my first full charge so I don't yet have a handle on the battery life. The Kindle app works great and looks crisp. Digital comics and magazines also look terrific. Connection to the Play Store and downloads and automatic updates was great. Overall my first impressions are excellent. Now, if time and future use change my thoughts I will update this but - for now - anyone looking for a compromise between an eReader and a full sized tablet, I would say that this 8\" Galaxy is a great choice and is also priced pretty competitively! I hope this is helpful to some of you.\n\nUPDATE:\nI'm sure that more knowledgeable Android users already know this but .... Adobe stopped supporting Flash Player for Android in 2012 so if you are looking to watch Flash content  you will not be able to watch on this tablet (or other similar Android tablets I suppose). But, there are work-arounds -- which I will be trying soon. I found a few links that walk you through how to download and install Flash on an Android; I'm sure there are hundreds more:\n\n[...]\n[...]\n[...]\n\nAlso, if you're like me and use Chrome as your primary tablet browser you will apparently need at least one other browser to view Flash content since Chrome doesn't support Flash. The Firefox and Dolphin browsers seem to get among the most references for this.\n\nI'll let you know how my experience works out. In the meantime .... I STILL LOVE THIS TABLET! :-)\n\nSUCCESS\nFollowed the simple instructions found on the adobe.com link above, downloaded the most recent Flash for Android version 4.xx, hit Install after it downloaded and, using the Fiefox browser I was able to start watching an Amazon VOD. Pretty simple ... and thankfully successful. Hope this is helpful to you less in-the-know users LKE ME!! haha"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "Overall, this is a good product and is definitely at the higher end of the tablet spectrum. However, there are a few questionable aspects to this tablet and you definitely pay the premium for one extra inch of screen. I got this because I did want the 8 inch screen and prefer android over apple. But I feel this is overpriced for the following reasons: you pay $100 extra for the 1 extra inch of screen, a first generation ipad mini starts at the same price, and the processor is dual and not quad like any other higher end tablets now.\n\n My biggest complaint is that Samsung still uses the cheap slippery plastic backing. This product is nice and thin which I like, but the extra width that the 8 inch screen causes mixed with the slippery back makes it a necessity to buy a case just so you have something to grip onto. This is still the nicest tablet I have had and I definitely like it, but I would only recommend it to people that strongly prefer android over apple and people that really want that 8 inch screen. Otherwise, there are definitely more cost effective alternatives. This is another classic Samsung product move designed to eat into Apple's sales so it will not likely blow you away so to say.\n\nPros: nice 8 inch screen, thin and light for the size, a few nice apps that allow you to multi-task, use as remote control, etc., less than average bloatware\n\nCons: very slippery and can be awkward to hold, price seems high when compared to other products"}

The Galaxy Tab 3.8 has all but replaced my computer , I use it for everything now and my laptop has become an expensive paper weight .\n\nThe 8\" is not so small that I have to strain to read and not so large that it is uncomfortable to hold . It is thin , lightweight and fits in my hand perfectly . The screen is nice and colors are vibrant . Controls are responsive , no lagging or slow to open apps .\n\nIt does everything I need it to do and it does it quickly and does it well . Is it the best tablet out there with all the bells and whistles ? No , but it is one great tablet none the less . And after adding a 64 GB Micro SD card , I have all the on-board storage I need . I also have the flash drive adapter so I can use all my flash drives also .\n\nMy only complaint would be that the camera has no flash . But I have a very expensive digital camera for pictures ."}

I've been using various distros of Linux since 99 and Mac OS since 0S 8 and loved my Amiga 2000. My current phone is an iPhone 4s. My wife wanted a tablet so after some research, the Samsung appeared to fit the requirements. Once it was received and a few minor hiccups resolved, it quickly became my wife's daily choice for her computing needs. I had a chance to also use it to become familiar with it and help my wife who is defiantly a non tech type. Over all I was fairly pleased with the android OS  though have had issues getting credit for appps that came with buying the device. Android on this device was easy for me to pick up and the only initial complaints I had were the case I bought and difficulty of getting a easy to apply screen cover which no matter how hard I tried would not adhere to the screen without bubbles which would get worse after just a few days usage - made me truly appreciate my otterbox for my iPhone. generally speaking the apps are good - just not quite as good as my iPhone apps but over all I'd say They did the their job good -\nI care for my electronics so I can assure that this device was well cared for and protected from tje elements than can cripple or ruin any electronic device. So today after, after charging was completed, and indicated that the battery was full. The unit was unplugged from the wall and NO GO. The on/ off switch did not function and so far have been unable to get the table to turn. So the only rating I can give it is 1  - for it to die with less than 2 months of usage is unacceptable. So this is an initial review ... story to be continued as I try to trouble shoot the issue and see what samsung will do"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "Update 11-24-2013: Here's a link to compatible devices for amazon instant downloads.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/video/ontv/devices#Compatible%20Mobile%20Devices\n\nYou can access Amazon instant downloads only on Kindles or iPads. Also, I learned through a chat with Amazon customer service that Amazon is now using Silverlight for their instant videos and is no longer using Flash.\n\nOriginal Review: I bought this primarily for traveling, so I could access the internet, play movies and games on the plane, etc.\n\nThis has a wonderful display. But to stream or download Amazon Prime Movies you need Adobe Flash. And unfortunately, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8 doesn't support Adobe Flash. So you can't stream or download Amazon Prime movies. You can view movies through Google Play, but they seem much more limited in the number of free or reasonably priced movies.\n\nI agree with another reviewer who said that the Samsung Galaxy is very google-centric, which I'm not crazy about due to data privacy issues. This device is really designed to work with google apps and products. Unless you want to go down the google road, this device is a headache. (For example it took me 30 minutes to change the default browser from Google.)\n\nThis is my first experience with tablets and I have to say I feel that they are very overrated, or if they were less expensive it might be worth it. Most of the tablet platforms don't play well together or force you to use certain products, which is unfortunate for consumers. I would rather get a smaller laptop and have full features and have more flexibility in choosing the products and service providers I use.\n\nUpdate: 11/11/12 -\n\nI signed out to update my review in terms of privacy with this device.\n\nIf you value your privacy (and I don't mean that sarcastically -- some people really don't care about sharing a lot of information) you may have a hard time with how much of your privacy you are prompted to or must waive to google to use the device and many of the features. For example, I have received book suggestions based on the content in my gmail/google hangouts, you have to enter a credit card to download free content from the google play store, and many others. I realize that most people born after 1990 have a different outlook on this compared to people who remember life before facebook, and computers for that matter.\n\nI agree with the person who commented that another tablet might be better for people who want to use a tablet for pure recreation. I want to turn the thing on and be able to watch a movie or play a few games. I don't want to spend a lot of time searching for ways to do something that I should be able to do with a single tap on the tablet.\n\nFor people who say there is a way to stream or download amazon prime movies on this device and/or download adobe flash (that's required to stream/download amazon prime movies), please share the step-by-step how-to details in the comments. If I find a way to do so, I will update the review. I've seen a lot of how-tos on installing flash on tablets running jellybean 4.1, but nothing for jellybean 4.3. Also there seems to be a way to download flash on android phones running 4.3, but not tablets. So until then, I stand by my review that you cannot stream or download amazon prime movies on this device."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "Purchased to use while traveling.  No Flash Player support available so the Galaxy Tab 3 does not play Amazon Prime instant videos, or work on SW Airlines for in flight movies and internet access, etc.  I was told by Amazon that \"At this time, Amazon Instant Videos cannot be streamed or downloaded to Android devices. I'm sorry for the disappointment this may cause. The Android OS has been switched over to HTML/ HTML5 platform from Flash. This is the reason you will not be able to stream the videos.\"  It would have been useful to know the product's limitations before placing an order.\n\nAnother problem is the user manual.  I could not access the internet via public access at airport and, without online access, I could not remedy this problem since the user manual is online.  Once I got home and was able to access the online user manual, I found it poorly written and not well organized.  The answers may be there but the user is constantly referred back and forth to multiple pages to answer even the most straightforward questions.  Recommend an aftermarket book, e.g., \"My Samsung Galaxy Tab 3\" by Eric Butow.\n\nMy family members have not had similar problems with their iPads or Kindle Fire tablets, so I will try one of those next."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "So I did my research on tablets. And I found three small tablets that seemed to be the best for the money: the google nexus 7, Kindle fire hdx, and samsung tab 3 8.0.  The first thing that really stood out was the 8\" screen on the samsung. Yeah the nexus 7 has a sharper screen when you look closely but it had both larger bezels and a significantly thicker frame making it feel chunky campared to samsung. The nexus does have a quadcore processor which is clocked at the same speed as the tab 3 8.0. But both are very fast. Otherwise these tablets are similar. They both have plenty of RAM, front and back cameras with HD video shooting, access to google play, and android's jelly bean OS. The samsung tablet felt so thin and sleek in hand. And the nexus' limited you to 32gb of storage, while samsung's tablet allowed you to expand from 16gb all the way to 80gb by adding a 64gb sd card which is now supported by the tab 3 line. This is very helpful if you like to carry your movies around with you. I ruled the kindle fire hdx out for several reasons before but mainly because it restricted you to amazons app store and media supply.\n  I bought the samsung tab 3 8.0. But i can confidently say that overall, all three tablets are great choices just be sure you actually look at them and play with them before choosing the one that's right for you."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "The reason I initially opted for the Tab 3 instead of the Note 8 was mainly because of the Tab 3's lower price.  However, after using the Tab 3 for a few weeks, I regretted not having bought the Note 8 instead. Though I loved the size, feel, look, features and light weight of the Tab 3, I was ultimately disappointed with it, and ended up sending it back for a few reasons. It seemed to lag on a fairly frequent basis, and scrolling wasn't usually very smooth. Also, since it has such a thin bezel on the sides, I had difficulty holding it, which to my annoyance resulted in accidentally pressing the buttons on the bottom of the device countless times (though I ordered a case for it after about two weeks of use without one, which did make it somewhat easier to hold).  After sending it back,  Amazon quickly credited my account, and I ordered the Note 8 instead, which I am quite happy with. It's easier to hold because the bezel is wider. I have not experienced any lagging after a couple of weeks of use. I also have to say that with the Tab 3, I really missed not having the S Pen like my Note 2 phone and the Note 8 both have. I much prefer the S Pen over using my fingers or a regular size stylus.\nOverall, I thought the Tab 3 was a nice tablet for the most part, and I probably would have kept it if it weren't for the lagging and the accidental button pressing. From the reviews I read on Amazon, lots of people are very happy with it, but for me it was worth the extra money to switch to the Note 8 (although I must say I do think that Samsung has priced it too high)."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "This is my first keeper. Prior to gt3 bought and returned gt2 10\". 8\" is perfect for me, not too small, not too big. I'm not married to samsung and not a fan but needed something more portable to replace a notebook asap. At the time of purchase 8\" options were limited. Originally $300+tx, put this tab in the premium range with average hardware.\n\nPros - it works, no hardware issues, android 4.2 seems ok, possibly better custom roms are available now or will be available in the future that utilize the hardware more efficiently but haven't looked into dev site in a while. My primary use GPS, maps, web, streaming video/audio. Occasional gaming multiplayer word games, draw something, my favorite NFS runs very well. Good sound. 16GB internal storage. USB/OTG support. Connect external SD with adapter, keyboard, mouse, possibly game controllers.\n\nCons or wishes - would prefer 4:3, higher screen resolution for text, less bloatware. I have yet to root and debloat. Need better camera + flash, take lots of pics, use scanner apps. Older 5mp phone does better than this tab. No 1080p video. Older 5mp phone does 1080p. 720p video isn't bad but nothing special. Brown looks like an electronic retro device from the 70's. Maybe samsung ran out of black and silver paint? I prefer dark bezel. Physical home button. I used to like it but after gaming and handling this tab for a while i realize nexus style on screen is better. In some cases lose a little bit of screen but at least orientation is not an issue and handling when gaming in horizontal mode is easier. Location of speakers. When gaming or holding horizontally i block speakers with hands. Sometimes accidentally touch capacitive buttons. Huge con 1.5GB ram!!! Only samsung can get away with it in 2013. 4.2 manages ram ok but a few times i had to clear ram manually. Its still overpriced considering the specs."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I had the original ipad, which was performing poorly since the OS is no longer upgradeable, and as a result, many apps were not running effectively.  I decided to go to a smaller format, and was looking at the ipad mini and several android tablets.  Mostly I do a lot of reading in landscape on my tablet so I focused on the ipad and android 8 inch formats.  For a slightly older set of eyes, I thought 8\" would be more useful than smaller screen sizes.  I ended up with the Samsung because of  the screen resolution, latest version of Android, and powerful processor.  It is far faster than my old ipad, and I love the HD size screen rather than the 4:3 proportion of ipads.  In a pinch, I can put it in one of my pants pockets for carrying around, but the screen is plenty large enough for reading and using apps.  I actually really like the Samsung mail app that comes preloaded, but I do use the Chrome browser, which loads quickly and allows easy selection of desktop vs. mobile sites.  Since I'm a gmail user, the seamless integration of android works terrifically.  After 4 months of use, the only downside I see is that it doesn't co-exist with my apple tv, and battery life is compromised vs my old ipad.  I easily get a full days use on battery, but recharge every night.  My old ipad I would charge probably every third day, but such is the reality of a brighter display in a smaller form factor. Very pleased with my 8\" tab3."}

But a problem here, an issue there, and within a few weeks off we went for e-therapy, commonly known as tech support. Sadly, Samsung tech support was . . . unsupportive. It was lackluster. It didn't sparkle. So the gorgeous tablet, with its issues unresolved, went back to Amazon -- which has a fabulous customer support staff -- and I went on to another tablet from a company that wasn't Samsung and was willing to provide detailed, helpful tech support. When you fall in love with an e-device, you're basically marrying its tech support. No matter how gorgeous the e-device is, no matter what it promises you, it's only as good as the tech support staff behind it.

The Galaxy is slightly smaller than the aforementioned Fire and the I-Pad, which I also have.  It is the perfect size though.  Its small and light enough to be comfortable to hold while reading it, yet large enough to show a decent picture when watching videos.  The screen is bright and the controls are responsive.  The only slight negative is the battery while the wi-fi is on.  It drains quicker than expected, even in standby.  Other than that issue, the Galaxy tablet 8 is a great product.  If you are on the fence, give it a shot. you won't be disappointed."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I was so POd at iOS7 that I ordered a Samsung Tab 8\" I LOVE typing on it and the correction system is far superior to iOS for ME (my preferences, just stating my experiences). I am definitely NOT an apple fanboy, and for decades have selected my technology according to what works for me.\n\nMy first problem with the Tab (being Google based/Android), was that it uploaded _all_ my information to my phone without kissing me or buying me dinner. It didn't ask my permission or allow me to set any parameters. And no matter how I deactivated the uploads, they reactivated again. It was like locking a door, and having someone tiptoe in anyway, because they have the key!\n\nALL my _locked_ Picasa photos were uploaded and I couldn't remove them. That alone freaked me. I had NO control over my phone--Google did.\n\nI tried to \"migrate\" my Picasa photos to another account, but even\nthough Google gives instructions and says it's easy peasy, I got\nconstant 500 error message all day. Google says it's temporary, but the\nforums say it's been that way for two years.\n\nThen, I noticed it went to my Firefox Browser (I don't use Chrome) and STOLE and uploaded (again, without my permission) all my bookmarks. I had no choice to upload this stuff or to filter it. That intrustiveness of Google's putting EVERYTHING on my phone creeped me out.\n\nThere were some instructions in various android fora on how to stop that behavior, but the galaxy phone is different from my apparently new Tab 8\" (software 4.2.2).\n\nI guess my brain has too many iOS grooves, and has trouble switching over. If I have to spend so much time to learn Android, I guess I can manage learning to use iOS7 on my miniPad, but I won't update my iOS 6.1.4 phone. I'll just jailbreak it asap.\n\nI figured if it was this difficult to feel comfortable and if I needed to spend days of research (BTW, the Tab arrived with ZERO instructions and assumed I could use it out-of-the-box. Not!) that I should return it and not waste any more of my time.\n\nSo, so long Samsung. So long nice keyboard. Back to frickin Apple.\n\nBTW, it is probably a fine tablet if you are an Android user already and if you don't have privacy issues, but I believe many of us (especially if long-term iOS users) don't switch well.  I write this review in case others have similar mindsets to mine, so they know what to expect."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I got the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 as a replacement for the Tab 2 7.0 I had been using for about 6 months. I can say that the difference between the two is night and day. I was happy with the Tab 2 until I got this one and experienced how much better it is in every way. Apps load faster, web pages load faster and it's not laggy at all. Its very fluid. After the old Tab 2 7.0 updated itself to Android 4.2.2 it became markedly slower and it even took a few seconds for the screen to rotate when you turned the device from portrait to landscape modes. Not so with the Tab 3 8.0. It does what you ask it to do and it does it right now.\n\nThe screen at 8\" is really the ideal size for me. The Tab 2 had its navigation buttons on screen taking up real estate making what you were viewing that much smaller. On this tablet you get the full 8\". With Samsung's new design all of the buttons are moved to t bottom bezel and you get their signature physical home button. I like having everything standardized across the line of products because it makes the learning curve very short when you go from device to device.\n\nI use this tablet primarily to read Kindle books when I go to bed, surf the internet and read news, online shop and I also use it to process credit card payments for business. Square register works perfectly on this tablet (it also works on my old Tab 2 7.0). However, the PayPal Here app is not compatible with the device. I would assume that's an app issue and not a card reader issue, but I prefer to use Square to process credit cards anyway.  I don't play games, so I can't speak to its performance doing that, but it does everything I ask of it and it does it better and faster than its predecessor. I can't ask anything more.\n\nOne little idiosyncrasy I have discovered is that when I use it in landscape mode and I have my left hand at the Samsung logo end of the device it appears to block some of the wireless signal. I've never lost connection as a result, but it does indeed cut the signal considerably. When I move my hand to another position the signal returns. Now, I have a very good router that puts out a strong signal even at the opposite end of the house, so I suspect it would drop the signal were it not for my router. I don't know if this is an issue that's unique to my individual unit, or if it's just due to the new design. The Tab 2 7.0 had no such issue. That's the only quirk I have found and it doesn't seem to affect its performance in my case, but I did discover it and thought I'd pass it along.\n\nI'm totally satisfied with my purchase and I would whole heartedly recommend this tablet without hesitation."}

Video playback on Netflix is smooth and seamless, browsing fast and simple.\n\nOne drawback, and this unfortunately I found out AFTER I bought it:  this device is not compatible with Amazon Video streaming.

The following will be such a review regarding the Samsung GAlaxy Tab 3 8.0 tablet and what I consider false advertising on page 139 of the online user manual which one would normally review prior to a purchase.\nAs a happy owner of two Galaxy Android devices, I decided to add a tablet. I have been satisfied for the most part with this device. I purchased it two weeks ago from a brick and mortar, big box store and have been gradually going through the many features and testing them out before the 15 day return period expires.\nToday, I reviewed the user manual and followed the steps to activate the \"FINDMYPHONE\" feature. This is a really cool, feature that allows one to locate their lost or stolen device.\n\nI spent two hours during which I encountered the following obstacles placed in my path by Samsung:\n1) The website which you are directed to for the FINDMYPHONE feature implies that you can use the same password at the samsung.com website where you register your device ( which I had done) but alas! a new password is required. So no problem, I figured this out with the help of their chat line during which I gave them my model number several times.\n2) After finally getting an account setup at the SAmsungdive.com website, I went to the screen to register my new device there and, lo and behold, this feature is not available for my tablet. It is available for other tablets such as the GAlaxy Note 8.0 which I had seriously considered buying, but not available for Tab 3 8.0!\n\nWell this false advertising really chaps my hide and I must say that after 10 minutes of hammering on my keyboard, I do feel a little bit better. Thanks for reading.\n\nAnyone out there who might be planning on buying this tablet because it has the FINDMYPHONE feature, should be advised that it is NOT AVAILABLE on the Tab 3 series.\n\nI will update this posting if any of the above information changes. And, yes, I am aware that third-party FINDMYPHONE apps are available but I am not willing to root the device for this purpose."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "Due to the recent releases of the Asus MeMO 8 and the Dell Venue 8, I have updated this review to reflect the new tablets and the price drops of each of the tablets.\n\nThe Samsung Tab 3 8 is an attractive, light weight, easy to use tablet with a decent screen.  It is reasonably fast, but it is still IMO a slight bit overpriced for it's specs.\n\nUPDATE 27 Nov 2013:\n\nThe price of the Samsung Tab 3 8 has recently dropped to 249 dollars.  At this price, it is more competitive.  Asus has recently released the ASUS ME180, an 8 inch tablet with a quad core processor, micro sd card slot, and front and back cameras.  The Asus is selling for 229 dollars and is a worthy competitor.  Based on my experiences with Asus and Samsung, I would rate these two tablets neck and neck for features.  I rate the Samsung ever so slightly better for overall build quality, however, build quality can vary greatly among tablets.  The Samsung also feels a bit more comfortable in the hand.  Unless you have a brand preference or prefer one over the other because of design or ergonomics, either of these two tablets are very good.\n\nUPDATE 3 Dec 2013:  The Dell Venue 8 is a pure android tablet.  It has been selling for $179.00 and even as much as 20 to 50 dollars less on sale.  It runs on an atom (dual core) chip and has 2gb of memory and 16gb of storage.  It looks like a good budget tablet but still offers reasonable quality and a one year warranty.  Dell tends to be much better at honoring their warranties and at customer service than any of the other tablet makers other than Apple.  The display is 1280 x 800.  The most significant complaint about the tablet appears to be the touch screen sensitivity not being very good or at times unresponsive.  It also has an micro sd slot and camera.\n\nUPDATE 10 Dec 2013:  The ASUS MeMO 8 tablet has dropped to 199 dollars.  Unless you have a brand preference for Samsung, need the TV remote control features, or have a preference for the lightest tablet possible, then you may want to seriously consider the Asus MeMO 8 or the Dell Venue 8 as less costly alternatives to the Samsung Tab 3 8.  The Tab 3 8 is still selling at a premium ($249) to the cost of the Asus Memo 8 ($199) and the Dell Venue 8 ($179).\n\nIn the 8 inch tablet category there is now the following tablets in the order of my overall judgment of their desirability (see specs at the end of each for comparison purposes):\n\nSamsung Tab 3 8 - at 249.00, this is still a bit costly, but it is light, responsive and has a good screen. Probably has a slight edge on reliability over the others.\nSpecs: 1.5 GHz Samsung Exynos 4210 Dual Core processor, 1.5 GB DDR2 SDRAM memory, 1280 X 800 resolution, Mali 400 GPU, .68 pounds\n\nAsus Memo 8 - at 199.00, the ASUS MeMO 8 is the best value in price vs. performance for the 8\" tablet market.  Samsung is placing itself as a premium tablet while the Asus Memo 8 is priced as a good quality tablet at a reasonable price.\nSpecs: AMD Quad Core 1.6GHz processor, 1 GB DDR3L SDRAM memory, 1280 X 800 resolution, Mali 400 MP4 graphics, .8 pounds\n\nDell Venue 8 - at prices ranging from 129.00 to 179.00 for the 16GB tablet, it is definitely worth a look. Dell tends to be good on customer service and this tablet has 2GB of DDR memory which is definitely a plus. One review commented on the lack of response for the touch screen, however reviews on Dell's site have been positive. The Dell Venue 8 runs true android. If you can get a branded 8\" pure android tablet for the $129 Black Friday sale price, the deal is hard to pass up.  Note: As of 12/19/2013, Dell has released an update so that multiple user profiles can be used on the Venue 8.\nSpecs: Intel Atom Z2580(up to 2.0GHZ)Dual Core processor, 2GB DDR2 memory, 1280 X 800 resolution, Intel HD Graphics, .82 pounds\n\nAcer Iconia A1-810 - gets some good reviews and sells for about 170.00. It is kind of heavy at 1.01 pounds (If Amazon's specs are correct). It also has a lower resolution than the other tablets.  With the release of the Asus MeMO 8 and the Dell Venue 8, this tablet is trailing the others by a bit.  Amazon shows a few complaints about the customer service.  The Acer A1-810 was on sale for as low as 149 dollars recently.\nSpecs: Acer MTK MT8125 1.2 Ghz Quad Core processor, 1 GB DDR3L SDRAM, 1024 X 768 resolution, Integrated PowerVR SGX 544 Graphics, 1.01 pounds (website says 14.46 ounces or approximately .9 pounds)\n\nHappy shopping!"}

It is very fast and execute multiple tasks with ease.  I am amazed with it actually.  And for the price, can you say,\"What an awesome deal?\"  Yes, I know it is $300.00 for the 8-inch even in local stores but that is a steal for the quality and performance of this epic machine.  I gave 5/5 because it really deserves it.\n\nI will recommend this product to everyone and anyone who maybe interested for owning or using a tablet."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "8\" is the perfect size. I tried a 7\" tablet and full web sites were difficult to view. So I went up to the 8 inch tablet and found it's the perfect size. For web, reading, games whatever you want to do with it. As far as this brand, the Samsung Tab 3, I do love almost everything about it. The screen is fantastic, the looks are classy, and it's so thin! Downside is the speed at loading web pages, it's half a beat too slow. My Samsung Note 2 cellphone is faster than the Tab 3.  If your on the fence, I'd say go for it but if you have some time before purchase might want to check the specs and see if the next one has a bit faster processor. But size wise, you'll be much happier with an 8\" tablet rather than a 7\" tablet."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I've had this for a few days now and I'm loving it.  Why the Galaxy?  I recently got a Macbook Air (which is awesome) but I decided that a very similar OS on a tablet would be boring (and didn't want to spent over $500 on a tablet!) so I decided to look for an android tablet over iPad.  Based on ratings and reviews, I narrowed it to the Galaxy Tab 3 and the Google Nexus.  The Google Nexus has slightly higher specs and a super hi res screen but it isn't as polished a device as the Galaxy.  Users commented on the Nexus saying that it was lagging and freezing.  It also looks like something from a couple years ago both in terms of exterior appearance and the interface.  Super hi res screens on tablets is a bit ridiculous IMO - my 47\" LED is 1080 so having something double that on a 7-10\" screen is just not a huge improvement.  The reviews on the Galaxy were high, it is an established and polished model, the interface looks great and my favorite - it includes an IR emitter and the Peel entertainment system app.  I chose the 8\" size as it's the perfect size and has higher RAM than the 8\" and 10.1\".  Also, I think that 7\" and below is too small for a tablet and 10\" is encroaching on too large for ease of portability and handling.\n\nIt has been great so far - some pros:\n-Easy to set up\n-Has been zippy\n-Good interface\n-Clear, nice image\n-Size is perfect and it's really thin - thinner than my Motorola Droid Razr Maxx\n-Well priced\n\nI love the IR emitter and Peel application - in addition to the low price, this added feature made getting a tablet definitely worth it.  I've set it up with my living room entertainment system consisting of a LED, A/V Receiver w/ Surround, Verizon FIOS cable box, Blu Ray player and Roku.  I can enter the app and choose 'watch roku, watch blu ray or watch tv' and when I select those options - it will set the correct TV and Receiver input, turn on the necessary components and then gives you an on tablet remote control for that device to navigate the Roku, DVD player or TV.  You can set it to use the AV receiver as your sound for each device so when you use the + - sound keys on the digital remote - it will change the receiver sound.  The home page lists everything that's currently on cable by categories like 'drama' or 'reality'.  You can click on the program and it changes your cable box to that channel.  I like this more than the Verizon FIOS remote app which gives you a TV guide like interface to browse to choose a show as it organizes shows by categories and has a picture for each program so you can more quickly see what's on.  You can also add your favorite channels to the top bar and under each channel image it lists what is currently airing on each.  You can also view what's on later in the day and set alarm reminders for upcoming shows.  Very sweet.  I love it as I watch a lot of TV/movies and do not like using 5 different remotes.  There are universal remotes with LCD screens that cost $200 - why get one of those when you can have it in within an even better interface and multifunctioning tablet.\n\nOf note:  To set up my receiver, I had to run the pairing a few times....  it will find a code that turns off your receiver but that doesn't mean that the first one it finds is the right one for your model.  I had to rerun it three times telling it that a specific code did not turn on the receiver when it really did as when that code was used - the list of inputs did not match its actual inputs."}

Some of the issues I have with it have to do with touch-screens in general - - sometimes they're too sensitive and other times they don't recognize your touch. Other issues have to do with the particular app being used and not the tablet itself. It would have been nice if Samsung had included a small user manual with simple pictures explaining how to use it, but if you're patient and experiment, you can figure it out via trial and error. I like the free games, but sometimes the ads that pop up are annoying. This tablet is thin, light, and gives best tradeoff between screen-size and hand-fit. Battery life is great. Screen visibility is good in all types of light. I turned-off the automatic ambient light brightness-adjustment feature because in some parts of the house it made the screen too dark.

The only problem that I've been having so far started this past weekend, when I was using Youtube. Some of the videos I wanted to watch I couldn't because I needed to download Adobe Flashplayer.

I also have a Nexus 7 and can't tell you how much more the extra inch of screen makes. Don't be put off by the fact the Tab 3 8 has a dual core processor it powers the tablet just fine in fact in side by side tests with my Nexus 7 everything was quicker on the tab 3 maybe it's the extra half gig of ram all I can say is every app I opened side by side came up quicker on the Samsung Tab 3. Also the screen on the Samsung is very nice colors look good and are very vibrant. I also love the screen mirroring feature which works perfectly on my Samsung Smart TV and the IR blaster is an added bonus the tab works great as a remote. I also happen to like Touch Wiz it adds a lot to Android in my opinion. Build quality is also top notch it may not be metal but the construction is very good and feels very solid. If your looking for a 8 inch screen this is the tablet to get if you want a 7 inch device I would go for the new Nexus 7."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I've used my Galaxy 3.0 tablet for 2 weeks, every day, and I couldn't be happier.  I find the screen to be great, very sharp and very responsive, and am not having any issues with rapid discharge - in fact I have been able to go 2+ days on one charge as long as I let the tablet sleep when I am not using it.  I purchased one of the cases that put the tablet in sleep mode when the cover is closed, and this may be hapling with battery life.  So far I have not watched videos much but I have spent lots of time on the internet, listening to music (through earbuds) and on youtube and with multiple apps open at the same time.\n\nI often edit documents and photos on the tab and am very happy with its performance. OTG capability is a must for me as I use my tablet as a laptop replacement when I travel and I need to be able to transfer files from SD cards and USB drives. File transfer and uploading/downloading to the internet are all very fast, much faster than my previous android tab, which was a relatively new and very well-rated 10-inch tab from a different manufacturer. I have a Motorola bluetooth keyboard which works beautifully with this Samsung tab (all the keys work properly with no resetting).\n\nI am finding the 8-inch size to be perfect for me, just big enough for all the \"work\" I do (file and photo editing) and for watching videos but small enough to be very easily transportable.  It is also a perfect size for reading (eg using the Kindle app), and the tablet has a \"reading mode\" setting that is easily accessible that optimizes the screen for such apps.\n\nA few caveats - I use a Samsung Galaxy phone and so am used to the Samsung interface and am a fan of it.  I like the external buttons and I love that my phone and tablet interface so well.  Also, I have small hands so am not bothered by small buttons or form factor.  I am not a gamer so do not use my tab with those apps.\n\nI am very happy with my purchase."}
{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "The only single reason to buy this tablet is if you need an 8-inch Android tablet from a big-name manufacturer. That is it. No other reasons.\n\nIf you are content with 7-inch then get a new Nexus7, it is faster, has higher resolution and is cheaper. If you like Macs or prefer 4x3 screen then get iPad Mini, although its pixel density is too low for reading. Finally, if you want an Android tablet larger than 7-inch then find a Toshiba Excite 7.7 on a closeout sale for $200, it is a better tablet than the Tab3 8.0.\n\nNow in more detail.\n\n* The screen is ok. Not super high-res, but higher resolution than the iPad Mini, ok for reading although I can see some aliasing but I don't see pixels. I do see pixels on the iPad Mini, which means that 163 ppi (the Mini) is not enough, while 189 ppi (the Tab3 8.0) is just ok. I would prefer 250 ppi for comfortable reading. The screen has proper white balance, not bluish or greenish, and shadows and highlights are rendered well.\n\n* It is fast enough for reading, some gaming and watching movies. No problem with 720p MKV video.\n\n* JB 4.2 is a rather modern Android version. But it is in phone mode, not tablet mode, meaning different location of some controls like notifications. Just a gotcha, not really a problem.\n\n* Physical buttons are old tech for Android, but Samsung still uses them. Ok, I don't mind, with physical buttons the whole screen is used for content, which is always good. But the Menu and Back buttons are too sensitive and get in the way when you use the tablet with two hands in landscape mode. Really, really annoying and you cannot turn them off! I've read that only if you root the system you can change system properties to turn the pesky buttons off. But then some people have problems turning them back on. So beware.\n\n* No finger rejection feature that the iPad Mini has. Basically, you can hold the Mini with the thumb on the screen and still use another finger for tapping. Not so with the Tab3 8.0, and you cannot hold it at the edge as the bezel is too thin. Holding it with two hands is problematic as I wrote above, so the only way to hold the Tab3 is across the back, in open palm of the hand. Pitiful ergonomics. Samsung engineers never tried using their product, I am sure it went directly from a computer model to production.\n\n* White plastic instead of aluminum or magnesium. I personally don't care, but after a couple of weeks the shiny plastic will get all scratched, and the tablet will look like 5-year old device.\n\n* MicroSD slot is good, what can I say. No HDMI out, whatever.\n\n* Charges through USB, no separate charge port. This is good as you don't need extra cables, but charging takes long time.\n\n* Specs: ok for 2012, not enough for 2013. The Toshiba Excite 7.7 released a year ago has the same or better specs and better build quality and is thinner.\n\n* Discharge when in standby mode: initially it discharged in less than a day, twice. But charged for the third time and it is already a day and a half, and still 91% of juice left (wi-fi left on). So not so bad as I initially thought."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I'd like to preface my review by saying that I've always had an affinity for Samsung products. I've owned the original Galaxy tab 10.1, Samsung Series 9 ultrabook,  Galaxy s3, Note 2, and the Nexus 10 tablet. But for those that may simply dismiss me as a fanboy, that's not to take away from my enthusiasm towards tech in general - I own a 15' Retina macbook pro, Ipad 4, Vaio Pro 13, and have had a myriad of other products along the way which I have thoroughly enjoyed. If it works well and fits my needs, I will get it.\n\nI like to appreciate each product for what it truly is: the value and usefulness it can provide me. This Galaxy tab 3 8 is as good as any tablet out there on the market today.\n\nSize and Build Quality:\nIn my opinion, 8 inches is the perfect size for tablets. 7 feels a little cramped, and isn't the best for reading books or watching media on. 10 inches is great if you're always at home, but not so much if you're on the go or traveling. The 8 feels like that perfect equilibrium between the two that combines screen usability, with portability.\n\nBuild quality? What can I say, it's typical Samsung. It's not made of crazy precious metals and rare materials; nor should you expect it to be. However, it's sturdy, light, durable, and doesn't have any flex or creaking when held. It's also extremely light so you won't even feel the difference in weight when you throw this thing in your backpack or bag. You can also easily hold it in your hands without having to use a brace for hours without fatigue or discomfort. The Gold Brown color looks luxurious to me and is a unique offering by Samsung.\n\nDisplay:\nIs it a 300+ PPI, top-of-the-line incredible monster display? No. Does it pack enough pixels to rival retina displays? No. Does it really make a difference? Well, I can honestly say in terms of actual everyday use and color reproduction, no it does not make a difference.\n\nSide by side to a Retina Ipad 4, I watched 1080p videos of a wide variety ranging from Nature, Cars, Sports, Music Videos, you name it. The Galaxy Tab 8 easily held its own, and you'd be hard pressed to notice enough of a difference between the 2 displays to really complain or nitpick at all. I'd venture as far as to say that the color looked even better on certain videos on the Tab 8, but I don't want to start another online feud with Apple loyalists so I'll stop right here.\n\nThe 1280 x 800 display is plenty for a tab of this size, and for comparison is a higher resolution than the iPad Mini.\n\nFor games, movies, pictures and browsing, it's a perfectly fine display. The only thing I will say, is that text is more crisp, clear and sharp on the Ipad and Nexus 10. If you're not used to those displays, you'll have no complaints with the display on the Tab 8. Nor does the difference make reading/browsing difficult or straining by ANY means. Simply put, the displays on those other 2 devices are out of this world, and you shouldn't expect this tablet in this price range to match that offering.\n\nFunctionality:\nTouchWiz: Most people hate it or love it. I've tolerated it in the past, but have grown to appreciate its added features over the years. It's not as cartoon-y or bloated as in the past. TW on this tab is fast, responsive, and offers some nice features you won't get on Nexus devices or other brands. All I can say is, try it for yourself. They've made it easy to use and it doesn't interfere or get in the way of the Android experience in my opinion.\n\nIf you hate it, you can install Nova or other launchers and customize your look and layout from there.\n\nProcessor: The Dual core exynos and 1.5 gb ram should be plenty for 90% of users out there.\n\nI don't play too many games on tablets so I'll let some of the other reviews answer those questions. But I played Candy Crush, Baseball Superstars 2k13, and a few others for test, and they all played smooth and fast. Note that the referenced games aren't the most graphically demanding or intense.\n\nFor normal tasks such as browsing, media, email, video chatting? You've got plenty of power, don't worry.\n\nThe Tab 8 comes with Polaris Office which is great as it offers a comparable experience to the Office Suite of products on your tablet. You're not going to be writing a novel on this thing, nor are you going to open up 40,000 line spreadsheets and perform data analysis. However, for touching up documents on the go here and there, it's a perfectly fine alternative solution.\n\nIR blaster: Samsung gave us this nifty feature along with the SmartOn remote app. It hooked up to my LGTV and Comcast set top box within seconds, and I was able to control almost every function of my Home entertainment system from my tablet. It's great to see a large colorful TV guide, and I appreciate and enjoy this feature. If you don't like it, you don't have to use it.\n\nCamera: Adequate. I myself don't take photos with a tablet. If you do, this will work for things like taking a quick food pic or family pic. It won't blow your shoes off, but you probably shouldn't be expecting a tablet camera to do that.\n\nSpeakers: Blah. They're both positioned at the bottom which is not ideal, especially in Landscape mode. The volume levels are decent but nothing to write home about. I wish Samsung stuck with the 2 stereo front facing speakers of the 10.1 2 and Nexus 10. Easy fix? Use earphones.\n\nMicro SD Card: Oh, the feature that so many users covet, but so few manufacturers actually provide. HTC, Apple, and Nexus devices all fail to grasp the importance of this functionality. Samsung provides this so you can store your music, photos, books, documents, and movies when you need that extra storage space.\n\nThere's not too much else that will be a different experience from other Android tab offerings. Apps such as Kindle, Amazon, Netflix, Flipboard, etc are all what you'd expect and work great.\n\nIf apps, more specifically tablet optimized apps are important to you, then perhaps an Android tablet still isn't the right choice for you. Apple still has far more tablet optimized Apps than the Play Store. However, with the advances already made over the past few iterations of Android, and the rising popularity of tablets in general, I think developers will see the value for providing tablet optimized Apps for Android going forward.\n\nLastly, price: at $299, the value of this product is really hard to beat. It's in the price range to appeal to a wide base of users' budgets, and backs it up with great functionality, features, and design. I'd recommend to any of my friends and family."}

The 8\" size is very nice, it is lightning fast, the screen is crystal clear and the myriad of upgrades make it the best tablet I have ever used.  I am not that tech savy, I can only say that it is so easy and fun to use.  The price is a bit high, but after actually seeing it in person and using it for awhile it is worth every penny.  I think the Samsung tablets are far superior to the Apple ipads.  I am very happy with with it and would say to anyone thinking of purchasing this tablet to go for it, you won't be disappointed.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I can only compare this tablet to my Kindle Fire HD 7.  I did not give the Kindle a rave review as I feel the software implementation is rather poor.\n\nNow this tablet is a full Android and the functionality is impressive, especially comparing to Kindle Fire HD7,\nIt is fast, supports full device encryption, allows a microSD .\n\nThe KFHD7 does have better speakers though.\n\nNo amazon prime instant streaming app available to android phones/tablets, and Adobe stopped support for mobile devices browsers. Old versions of Flash player will work for now, but the point is Amazon lacks an app for Android. Amazon is leveraging that to drive sales of Kindle. That could be a reason not to buy this tablet, however netflix works great.\n\nSo the KFHD7 does not come with power charger and Amazon charges $19.95 for one and $15.00 to make the Kindle add free. Add that up and the price between this 8 inch Galaxy and the KFHD7 is pretty small. I was lured into the Kindle by price and I feel I got robbed! My child is now the sole user of the Kindle.\n\nIt should be noted that no concept of \"FreeTime\" is available for this tablet. I'd still recommend the KFHD7 for youngsters. Freetime is a sloppy mess,  but a 5 year old won't know it.\n\nThis tablet is SO good I WILL look at Samsung phones when my phone plan allows me to upgrade from my HORRIFIC Win7.5 phone. (tricked again by low price)\n\nGREAT WORK SAMSUNG!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "This is the first time I write a review on Amazon.com. I give 4 stars for this product because of the quality of the camera. I've tried camera of Galaxy S4 (phone), Galaxy Note 2 (phone), Galaxy Tab 2 (this one), iPad 3, and iPhone 4. The quality of the pictures taken from Apple products are way better than Samsung's. I think my iPhone 4 has better camera compare to Samsung Galaxy S4 & Note 2 (iPhone 4 has 5.0MP, Note 2 has 8.0MP, S4 has 13.0MP).\n  Besides, I am so satisfied with features of this tablet. It is light enough to be held with one hand, whenever you stand, sit, or lie. I like the widgets, which Apple products don't have. Moreover, I can use this tablet as a GPS. I downloaded the app called \"Navigator\" and use it as an GPS. It works offline because of the maps saved in microSD card.\n  I used this tablet mostly for reading. I have a lot of pdf, epub, and other files on Dropbox. All I have to do is download them to the tablet and enjoy the books.\n  It does have \"Smart Remote\" which can be used for most TV. It worked with my old CRT Mitsubishi. S Voice is also very funny to play with.\n  Things I do not really like are music app, Youtube app, and the files are so unorganized. I used Chrome for watching Youtube, instead.\n  I prefer this one to iPad because it's light and doesn't stick with iTunes. In my opinion, the touch technology of Apple is the better than other companies, at least for now. Although this has better specs than iPad 3 does, I still feel iPad are smoother than this.\n  In general, this is a good tablet. I would be happier if it was less expensive a little. I recommend this tablet for students and people who like to read. Do not buy if you want to use it for taking pictures."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I bought this tablet on release day at Best Buy. This tablet is the perfect blend of portability with a big enough screen to comfortably web browse. It is lightweight and the slim side bezels allow me to grip it with one hand. It is designed with portrait orientation being it's preferred position which is the way I find myself holding it 90% of the time anyways unless watching videos.\nThe inclusion of hard buttons makes the most of the screen real estate, but take some getting use to if you come from non-Samsung android devices as myself.\n\n  This device has become my favorite android device that I use on a daily basis. It fits in cargo pants/shorts pockets. I also have an HP Touchpad running android that I never use that much due to its weight and size. I use this to read books, web browse, listen to music, and watch videos.\n\n  I am a tech junkie. I have also been involved with android since its first device, the original Motorola Droid. I want to highlight some of the features of this tablet that make it stand out from the rest of the pack. I also want to correct misleading and sometimes incorrect information presented in other reviews.\n\n-Hardware-\n\nUnfortunately, Samsung chose to skimp a little on specs of this device. I'm sure it was because of the cost of the 8\" screen and yet trying to keep the overall cost cheaper than Samsung's premium line Note 8.0. If you are one that is dead set on using specs,i.e. processor, ram, resolution, as the main determining factor, this tablet will not stand out amongst competitors. What will stand out is the 8\" screen. This tablet is using the same screen as the Note 8.0. I find it sharp with natural colors and not over-saturated. Photos and videos look excellent.\n\nSamsung includes a microSD slot that can use cards up to 64GB. This can hold music, documents, and videos.\n\nThis model also comes with a forward and rear camera. The forward camera can be used with Skype and Google Hangouts and is also used in one of Samsung's software enhancements that I will touch on in a minute.\n\nAs you can see, nothing pops out from a hardware standpoint except it's form factor, 8\" screen, and microSD slot. It also has an InfraRed blaster built-in for controlling A/V equipment. I wanted to add that while this tablet may not be using top of the line specs, it does not suffer in the least bit from its exclusion. I have not experienced any lag or long delay.\n\n-Software-\n\nThis is where Samsung shines. It has some innovative features that enhance the tablet experience and brought back a much requested feature that was included in past versions of android.\n\nMulti-window - This allows more than one app to be open at the same time. This is a feature I don't use that much, but I find it nice if someone emails me to setup an appointment. I can have the calendar app and email app open at the same time to input the time/place from the email into the calendar. The multi-window feature does not work with all apps, only the ones pre-selected in the scrollable list which is understandably geared toward productivity.\n\nSmart Screen - This is a feature that uses the front camera to look at your eyes. This is a great feature when web browsing. It keeps the screen lit as long as you are looking at the tablet. When you look away, it allows the screen to timeout. I find this feature does not work well when reclined because it does not detect my eyes. This is due to the angle I am looking at the tablet with my eyes half closed. It also does not work well in landscape orientation most likely due to the camera being on the left edge in that position.\n\nMove apps to SD - This is a feature that was available in past versions of android. Google removed this feature in all current builds. Samsung reintroduced this feature in their tweaked version of Jellybean 4.2.2. This allows you to move compatible apps to your microSD which help frees up precious internal storage. Keep in mind, this does not work with all apps. It is up to developers of the apps to allow this feature. I tested this with Angry Birds, Netflix, Kindle. They all successfully moved to my microSD and ran flawlessly. Tip: You may have to format your microSD with the tablet instead of a PC for this feature to work.\n\nMiracast/Screen Mirroring - This device is Miracast certified. This allows you to wirelessly mirror the tablet's screen to your TV. For this to work you need a Miracast certified TV. Sony, Samsung, and LG all make Miracast certified TVs. You can also use a Miracast certified dongle that attaches to an HDMI input on your TV. This is the only small portable tablet that currently has this feature besides the Note 8.0. Even Samsung's new Tab 3 7\" does not have this feature.\n\nBluetooth v4.0 with aptX codec support - I had to dig to find that this tablet supports aptX codec. This is a huge improvement in sound quality via bluetooth. To use this, you also need bluetooth headphones that support aptX or an bluetooth dongle for your home stereo that supports aptX. Not all new devices support this, but I have found that Motorola and Samsung both have been including this in their newer products.\n\nPolaris Office - This tablet ships with Polaris Office installed. This lets you edit, create, and view Microsoft Office documents, spreadsheets, and powerpoint presentations. Some tablets and phones only come with a version that lets you view the files while Samsung included a full version with this tablet.\n\n-Conclusion-\n\nThis tablet is selling with mid-range specs, but a high-end user experience. It comes with Samsung's optimized version of android Jellybean 4.2.2. The only notable feature missing from this tablet is NFC which would have come in handy for the Miracast feature. Overall, this tablet comes packed with features not available on any other tablet in this price range or form factor. This is the first android device that I haven't wanted to root right away to gain more functions and abilities."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I purchased the 8\" Galaxy Tab 3 as an upgrade from my 7\" Galaxy Tab 2... I loved my Tab 2, but the Tab 3 is everything that an awesome tablet should be.  The 1st thing I noticed was how much more responsive the screen in the Galaxy Tab 3 is to the touch, taps and gestures are responded to immediately.  The 1\" larger screen makes  much more of a difference than I would have expected also; besides it being a comfortable size to hold onto, everything is just so much easier to view and read (especially if you use the \"reading mode\" feature).  Web pages are easier to view and navigate than on any other portable device I have ever tried.  This Galaxy Tab 3  has impressive amounts of power, battery life and speed for everything I have tried on it so far.\n\nI was happy to see that the Galaxy Tab 3 uses the same sized USB power adapter as my cell phone, so I have just 1 charger to bring with me when I travel now.  Transferring all of my apps and settings from my Tab 2 to this new one was so simple, I had everything the way I wanted on my Galaxy Tab 3 within just a few minutes.  The Jelly Bean Android OS gives you a real nice and simple user interface with too many cool features to mention.  And the on board 16GBs of space for apps is more than  enough for most people & the capability for a 64GB SD card is an enough to make iPod & iPad users jealous.\n\nI highly recommend the Galaxy Tab 3, in fact, I would rank it as being 98% perfect as far as tablets go (based on price, performance and features).  The only changes I would make would be to add a flash to the camera and the ability to remove some of the preinstalled apps - minor issues really that don't really take away from the great device that it is."}

For me, the iPad is just too heavy to use comfortably. It is tiring and annoying in any position. Check the specs -- this 8.0 is actually LIGHTER than the Kindle Fire HD 7-inch. The Kindle HD has better sound, but I wouldn't use either device for anything that needs audio without earbuds. It is the perfect size and weight for a personal device. I was really surprised how much difference the 8-inch screen makes over the 7-inch. I can use the browser(s) comfortably, where the 7-inch was almost unreadable. Note that the aspect ratio is wider than the iPad, so you're getting a much more usable screen for many purposes, especially browsing and watching videos. Most of the screen of the iPad (at least my 8.9 inch) is completely wasted for movies - large black bars above and below. NOTE: If you want to download movies, Google Play ONLY lets you store them on the device, which is pretty nearly useless since there are only about 9 or 10 GB left out of 16 GB. I immediately added a 64 GB Class 10 SDHC card, but Google and Samsung don't use it. The ONLY movie service I've found that downloads movies or TV to SD is VUDU. I highly recommend it, unless anyone can suggest an alternative.\nI was concerned that this device might be slower than the Kindle Fire HD or the Galaxy Note 8.0, but I cannot see any lag, and surfing seems very good and plenty fast. I'm getting over 20 MBPS download speeds using the GIST test tool and FIOS. Unless you specifically need the drawing features of the Note, I think you'll be pleased with the Tab 3 8-inch.\n\nOne criticism: I found that the AUTO brightness default on the Tab 3 8.0 was FAR too dim for indoor use, and I was adjusting manually instead. Download LUX Free, and you can change those characteristics. For me, I added two \"links\" with LUX: 1 lux=25% bright and 400 lux=80% bright  It now works perfectly."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "Everyone has needs to meet when selecting a tablet, and I had mine.\nAfter owning inexpensive yet serviceable tablets in the 7\" and 9\" sizes. I wanted one that was a step or two above them in functionality, especially, a GPS to use with offline nautical navigation. I evaluated my 7\" and 9\" tablets, to see if they would allow me to travel without my netbook. Of course I had to bring along the netbook until the issue was settled.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 model had been tempting me, but the proprietary power and USB connector was not to my liking. Samsung made the right move by going to a standard micro-USB connector for power and peripherals with the Tab 3 products.\n\nThe next question was the 7\" vs 8\" model? SGT3-8 has a very thin bezel, and is lightweight, so it's fine for holding to read a book, or browse the web. It comes with a higher screen resolution than the 7\" model (1080x600) and is the same as the 10\" version = 1080x800. That means you can cleanly view 720P video. The SGT3-8 has more memory, a faster CPU, is the thinnest of them all, and has better cameras when compared to either the SGT3-7 or the SGT2-7. Thus, I justified the extra cost, with a larger screen area as well!\n\nThe SGT3-8 has met every need so far:\n- Able to play MLB-TV's \"At Bat\" with a great picture, and no hesitation.\n- With the InstaTV Pro app, plays streaming TV from my HomeRun HD dual streaming tuner, I can watch real-time local TV stations.\n- The MX Mariner App, displays my position on (free) RNC nautical charts from NOAA, even if hundreds of miles offshore. It's a great back-up to a chart plotter.\n- After a sea or land voyage, airline apps will get me a ticket home.\n- Plays Amazon Prime Instant video. (after installing an archived [11.1 for Android 4.0] flash player)\n- It fits in my purse, with minor impact!\n\nI installed a 64 GB class 10 HDXC memory card to hold a load of movies, music, and my own high def video files. Of course that also receives the photos and video from the built in cameras.\n\nThe screen looks great, the audio is as expected. I quickly adapted to the Samsung rendition of Android. The tablet comes with 4.2.2, so it's up to date.\n\nIt works great with my Samsung UN55ES6100 TV. The TV's Soft Access Point can provide the WIFI signal to the Galaxy Tab, which in turn, can serve as in IR TV remote control. The Samsung \"Watch On\" app, serves as a TV guide, and you can switch to a show you browsed on the tablet, just by tapping a soft button on the app. The remote via the IR port, can also control my two older TVs that aren't \"smart\".\n With a \"Smart TV\", the SGT3 can play it's video content on the TV. I can play a movie that's on the SGT3's memory card, on the 55\" TV Screen, with no cables needed. Supposedly, I can display the TV's contents on the tablet as well, but I'm still working on that one.\n\nAll in all, after a little expenditure of time & effort learning about it, this thing does everything I need. It could handle solo travel, but at the very least will be a compact, light, and capable backup for my Samsung NB30 netbook."}

I sold my IPAD 3 to buy this and don't regret it at all, the IPAD retina is overrated, its bland in colors. This one feels like a mini HDTV LEDTV. I also have the Samsung 10.1 Note both in white, I think they make it less industrail looking than black/brown, more like something to have fun with.

I bought mine at Bestbuy for the same price, in white, and as soon as I turned it on I was on the web just like that. The wifi picks up signals from all over and when I got home it was easy to put in the info for my own wifi internet which was a key selling feature for me. Its super fast, the graphics when taking video are amazing and adjustable to 1600 and down to 300 and in hd. The battery life is great, when I first booted up, the tablets battery was at 46% and nearly 4 hours later I was notified to charge it because 15% battery life was left. I assume on full charge it will stay on for 8 or so hours. Mind you that I was skyping, going to youtube, facebook, and here to amazon for the duration of that time. Another thing is that it doesn't come loaded with a bunch of junk apps either so you have full control of every thing and finding an app is very quick and easy. I love the fact that it has a notepad type of feature where I can type in grocery lists or a memo for my job or whatever. I definitely don't need a pen and paper anymore for any things that I need to buy or remember because I can just type it in and save it for later. This is definitely a great tablet and recommend it even if it is your first (like me)."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "ADDED 8/25/2013:  I have to apologize for not correcting this review earlier regarding HDMI.  As far as I have been able to determine the Tab 3 8.0 does not have HDMI out at all, even with an adapter.  While HDMI is a nice feature its lack is not a deal breaker for me since I would rarely use it.\n\nADDED 7/30/2013:  If anyone needs a nice carrying case (not cover) check out a Rip Offs CO-58.  It is the perfect size for the Tab 3 8.0, even in a Moko cover and has a couple of small pockets on the front just right for OTG adapter, flash drives, USB cables, etc.  CO is clip on, BL-58 has a belt loop.  I mainly use it for packing everything together and adding a little extra protection when I travel.\n\nADDED later on 7/19/2013:  Does anyone else find the micro USB port difficult to plug into?  I sent my firt Tab 3 back because I could not get either the cable that came with it or any of the many I own to even start to plug in.  When I got a replacement I was able to get the factory cable and most others plugged in, but a couple still won't go in at all.  They work fine on the many other micro USB devices I own.\n\nFollowing up my comments about USB keyboard below, I found an app called External Keyboard Helper that reprograms some USB keyboard keys such as the Esc key to emulate the Android \"Back\" button and Shift+Alt Esc to emulate the \"Home\" button.  Like holding \"Home\" holding Shift+Alt Esc displays open apps.  It also works with most bluetooth keyboards.\n\nORIGINAL POST:\nI deleted my earlier pre-delivery post rather than update it.  I am thrilled with the features I mentioned in the title.  They are the only things that kept my Tab 2 7 from being nearly perfect for me.  I have grown to HATE proprietary connectors as they limit your choices of available adapters.  Now I I like to have HDMI out capability for travel.  The Tab 2 does not have this capability, period.  Even with an adapter.  I am very happy the side bezels have been narrowed.  The Tab 3 8 is only .07\" wider than Tab 2 7, which is nothing, and only .5\" longer.  8\" screen and not much bigger overall.  Even in a case I can slip it in my pocket if I need to.  8\" vs 7\" is a HUGE difference.  For the last 4 years I spent a couple of hours a day on a 7\" netbook then a 10.1\" so I am very comfortable with the 8\", though I will still use my new 11.6\" netbook most of the time!  Other reviewers have done a great job praising the many features of the Tab 3 8.0 so I will limit my review to try to flesh out some of its USB capabilities.\n\nI immediately tried this micro USB OTG adapter and a flash drive:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/T-S-Electronics-Micro-USB-ASIN-B000Q8UAWY-Belkin-USB-2-0-4-Port-Ultra-Mini-Hub/dp/B005GGBYJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">T & S Electronics Micro USB[[ASIN:B000Q8UAWY Belkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra-Mini Hub</a>&nbsp;OTG Cable - LIFETIME WARRANTY!

The Tab 3 recognized it, but could not read the NTFS file system.  I am certain a drive formatted FAT32 would work fine.  Using the N_xus (fill in an e) Photo Viewer app I could read the drive but could only open photos.  There is a paid version of the app that may allow more access.  This was just a test.  Unfortunately the only apps to fully read NTFS seem to require root.\n\nI have an HDMI adapter for my Galaxy Note phone that I will try as soon as I can and report back.\n\nThat's about it for now except that I am typing this using the USB keyboard and mouse connected to the Belkin Hub!  Sometimes the onscreen keyboard will pop up and consume half the screen.  A right click on the mouse closes it.  Oh, the only minor thing that may have been better on the Tab 2 is that because the Menu Home Return buttons were soft buttons you could click on them with the mouse.  On the Tab 3 those are hard buttons that are off the screen so you cannot access them by mouse.  I am going to search to see if there are keyboard or mouse alternatives."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B00D02AHEO", "review": "I originally wrote my review after owning my tablet for a few days, and now have decided to edit it.\n\nI dropped from 5 to 3 stars.  Here's why.\n\nSamsung underperformed on this tablet.  After using it and also reading some reviews (I recommend you read the reviews on this, websites like theverge and cnet have reviews for this tablet), anyway it feels like they mailed it in on this tablet.\n\nThe display colors are very nice and bright, but I think they used a display that was good one year ago.  Using words like \"best in class\" wouldn't apply to anything about this tablet, instead it's average in class.  The screen, the speed and transition of apps, the RAM, the processing, everything.\n\nThis is probably an excellent tablet for most people, yet I couldn't keep it.  I didn't want to have a tablet that is average the day I bought it.  That means 1 or 2 years from now it could be lagging pretty heavy.  Is it any big deal?  No.  I mean, the lag is barely noticeable and the transitions from tasks or programs is pretty smooth - BUT... I don't want to have a hint of lag right when I buy something because in my mind that means it won't last as long.\n\nI also think the price is wrong on this tablet.  $300 for all mediocre parts isn't worth it.  If this cost $250 or so, then I think that would make more sense.  The other downside is the 16 GB of RAM, you can add an SD card but the problem is that most of the apps can't run from the SD card - things like streaming music or google play movies/TV shows can't download to the SD card, they have to go to internal memory.  So using a streaming service like spotify or google play all access, you can't save the GBs of music to the SD card - can't save the movies you purchased on google play to the SD card.  Note you only have 10 GB to actually work with (not 16 GB).  So if you have 2-4 GB of music, and 2 movies on your tablet (2 GB each) - your memory is gone and your system will run slow with no free memory.  Dropbox also wouldn't push to SD card, so all my documents kept eating up all my memory.  In the end I ran into too many issues in the first week of owning this.  Issues with lag, average screen, average speed, average build, average memory, all for a premium price.\n\nThe place this tablet shines is the size and the weight, I think 8\" really is the best but I can't sacrifice so many things to get an extra inch.  I recommend everyone read reviews on either CNET, theverge or whatever you want online to get an idea of how this tablet performs.  It's a great tablet for some but I think those who are looking for storage, performance or a high quality screen may want to look somewhere else.\n\nEdit:  Final thoughts - I think with the new release of a nexus 7 @ $229 and $269 (32GB), it may be better to grab that device.  It has a bit more under the hood and an amazing screen.  If those two factors aren't important to you though (processing speed or screen) then I think this samsung may be your best bet because of the slightly larger screen.  There is no Nexus 8 - if there was then there may not be a reason to buy this Samsung 8.0.\n\nEdit #2:  I now have the nexus 7, got an early shipment from Amazon.  It is MUCH BETTER than the galaxy tab 3.  Maybe andriod 4.3 is smoother but the stock android is a million times better and smoother than the samsung overlay (touchwiz).  The screen also on the 7 is much much better.  The processing speed is much much better.  The tab 8.0 has a larger screen which is the sole advantage.  If you just want a larger screen go with the galaxy 8.0, if you want the best sub 10 inch tablet on the market then go with nexus 7 2nd gen.\n\n________________________________________\n\nHOLD YOUR HORSES:  So I just wrote a review for the nexus 7.  It's as great as I say above... WHEN IT WORKS.  So I started to have issues with the nexus 7 like many other people.  There are rebooting issues, wifi issues, and GPS issues.  I did not have these with the Samsung.  I think Nexus might have cut some corners or not tested their device very well.  So there are some advantages to using older tech like the Samsung did, the newer stuff is more buggy.  We'll see what happens, I've returned my Nexus 7 for a replacement and am hoping that it was just a bad tablet.  Stay tuned.\n\nI do think this Samsung is a solid tablet - it didn't have all the bells and whistles but it did WORK.  Something the Nexus 7 can't say for 100% of users right now.  I am rethinking if I want to go back to this Samsung - the memory issue is real guys.  Having only 16 GB (down to 10 GB) on internal is terrible.  I can't tell you how many times you download songs/movies/documents (spotify, google play, dropbox) and you need the extra memory.  Sometimes I'm rolling with 4 GB of music - which is on a pay service, so you can't put it on SD card - or a movie rental, forget about renting movies on this samsung, those are like 3 GB (Batman movies for example).  So it's nice to be at 32 GB internal.  Tough decision, hoping the nexus actually works next time."}

The tab 2 cases for the 7 and 10 fit the tab 3's but because this is a new size I'm left waiting for the accessories to catch up. I'm worried that if the 8 doesn't sell as much there won't be a lot of options in that area.\n\nAt first I laughed at the $100 price bump for an inch. But after trying out the 10 and the 7 and really thinking through how we would use the tab we made the choice to go with the 8 inch.\n\nFor us, the 8 was worth it so far."}

I like its light weight, screen resolution and power.\nCannot believe how feather light the 8.0 Tab 3 is in comparison to my 7.0 Tab 2 of last year. Both front and back Camera's are great for a tablet of this level. I hate when comparisons are made to the I-pad mini or the note 8.0. I have tested both and for my needs and price range this is by far the best tablet. My Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 arrived one day before Amazon's e.t.a., thanks Amazon."}

Apple prides itself on aesthetics and beauty, but they haven't had much of a hardware change in more than 2 years.  If you want to talk about beauty, The GOLD-BROWN TAB 3 8 inch is perhaps the most beautiful and aesthetically pleasing tablet in its class.\nI recently upgraded my iPhone4S to a GALAXY S4 and couldn't be more pleased!  Although there is a bit of a learning curve for me in regards to certain Android OS differences from iOS (in particularly  all the settings choices), I am getting the hang of my S4 and have become a bit angry that Apple puts a lot of roadblocks up not allowing android devices direct access to iTunes and the whole Samsung vs. Apple thing that only hurts customers in the long run.  I have begun to find ways around Apple's roadblocks with the many apps that get around Apple's nonsense and allow me access to my music on whatever device I want it on.  My frustration with Apple has now led me to the GALAXY TAB 3 which is slowly replacing my 3rd Generation iPad.  Through Kies, DropBox, Chrome, Google Music, and Polaris suite of apps, I am finding my way into the world of Samsung and the many choices Jelly Bean android allows me to sync and personalize my devices MY WAY, instead of having some Apple designer in his IVES Tower tell me how they want my devices to work!"}

I had the ipad Mini and decided to give this a try and I'm very happy with my decision.\n\nI first tried the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 and was pretty disappointed with the screen and speed so I took it back and upgraded to the 8.0.  The difference is absolutely night and day.  Also, I'm very happy with the white color as the 7.0 that I had was the brown and it was a fingerprint magnet. If you are trying to decide between the two and are ok with spending the extra $100 then the 8.0 is a no brainer.\n\nThe screen is gorgeous and the form factor and size are perfect.  It is very thin and light but not cheap feeling in the least.\n\nYou will not be disappointed with this tablet.  Excellent work Samsung."}

I would reccomend it for anyone probably 13+. Can be easily used by children and adults. It has a long battery life and a relatively short charge time. This tablet is worth much more then I payed for, I am very happy with it."}

I know this tablet has been on the market for 4 years now, but after 4 years of constant use and not a single problem, I have to tell the world that THIS TABLET IS AMAZING. It is worth every single cent. It does everything a laptop can do, just on a smaller screen. Its features are just right for regular use, not souped up like newer models but certainly not outdated. If you're considering getting this tablet but you think it's too old, don't worry! It does everything you need and more! Can't recommend this tablet enough!"}
