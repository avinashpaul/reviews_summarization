{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I have already posted a similar review for the MBP old version, I am posting the same review here again since my review concentrates on the user interface of OS X. (not too sure whether I am allowed to do post the same review but just thought it could help some people before they switch to OS X)\n\nI have been a Windows user since I started using a computer and I never used a Mac OS X till I actually bought the MBP in 2011. So, this review would really help someone who is considering a Mac for the first time and wants to use it either at school or to remotely connect to work. This article summarizes what you would love and what you could be missing.\n\nI previously owned a desktop, a HP laptop and a Compaq laptop before I bought a MBP. Also, I still use Windows machine at work. One of the major reasons I bought the MBP was because it was available on a eBay deal from Macmall for $950. I assumed that if I did not like it, I could always sell it for at least $850 on eBay or Craigslist.\n\nBefore reading the next part, please do understand that MBP and OS X come together. Things you need to know --\n\n**OS X\n\nSwitching between applications - This is one of my biggest quirks with OS X. Windows 7 does an awesome job in switching between applications. When you want to switch between the applications, you use ALT+TAB in Windows 7 and this would shift the focus to the next application. If the application is minimized in OS X, you can switch between applications by using CMD+TAB but it does not automatically bring up the other application, it just changes the active application in menu bar. I never understood the reasoning behind this, why would I just want to see the menu bar of the other application, I cannot imagine doing anything just with a menu bar.\n\nAfter some search on the internet I found the work around to do this in OS X. The answer is to press CMD+TAB followed by the option key (just before releasing the CMD key) to switch between the applications perfectly. You can also scroll your four fingers on the track pad to bring up all the applications and then highlight the application you want to choose to change the active application window. It is simply irritating to switch between keyboard and the track pad when you are typing some document or email. You can also use function key F11 instead of swiping the four fingers on the trackpad but at the end of the day Windows 7 does a great job here.\n\nPlease do note that you can only switch directly between applications but not directly to the active window of an application when you use CMD+TAB, for example you cannot switch directly to a open second excel workbook, you have to bring up the excel application first and only then can you switch to the second excel workbook. I am aware that there is software available (namely Witch for $14) to do this but I already paid for the machine and why should I go through all this trouble and change the system registry entries to simply switch between applications.\n\nWe can also use spaces and assign some shortcuts to spaces(like option+arrow) to make the switch between applications easier but you need to assign a different space to every application and this could be tedious after some time. Also the animations could make you dizzy after a while (not too sure whether everyone would share the same opinion) and there is no way you can turn off these animations AFAIK.\n\nSwitching within an application - To switch between the various windows of the same application, the answer is to press CMD+~, it works but what if I have 3 open excel workbooks. Same answer as above, scroll the four fingers or press the function key F11 to see all active windows.\n\nTaskbar could be a big deal - It is irritating not to have a task bar in OS X. You can never actually know that you had two open excel workbooks or two separate browser windows at a glance. To put this into context, try working in Windows 7 grouping all your applications together all the time, in Windows 7 the users have the option to ungroup individual windows by selecting \"Combine only when taskbar is full\" in the taskbar properties. The problem with this approach in OS X is that you will never know all the application windows unless you display all the active windows or highlight the application in the docking bar.\n\nAlso, the docking bar still occupies a substantial amount of screen space even in its minimal size , in Windows 7 the taskbar is comparively small. Due to the screen size and resolution constraints we usually tend to hide this docking bar on the 13\" MBP so that we can see the applications in the maximum available screen space. So either compromise on seeing the active applications in docking bar or full screen mode for applications.\n\nAgain, the app Witch is the answer for taskbar but it will display these active windows only when we press CMD+TAB.\n\nFull Screen - I am addicted to seeing everything in maximized window mode in Windows 7 machines, I could never be satisfied with the default resized small windows, so I installed a free application RightZoom to address this issue. So far, so good.\n\nQuick Links - The docking bar essentially acts likes the quick link shortcuts in Windows 7. CMD+W closes the application and CMD+Q quits the application, you have to be careful enough not to press Q instead of W. Please note that closing a window does not automatically quit an application, the application is still active and consumes CPU resources.\n\nVPN Connection - Certain (or many?) VPN connection softwares like Juniper cannot be installed on OS X because some of these VPN connections connect using some plugins that are designed specifically for Internet Explorer, which is not available on OS X. I wanted to connect to work using the Microsoft Office remote desktop client but could not do it due to this restriction .\n\nExternal Applications - All the applications cannot be installed in OS X. There are lots of companies out there that make products just for Windows machines. I had to install StatTools for my course work and the tool was not available for OS X, so I had to work from another Windows machine at work on the weekends for my course work. I could have also installed Bootcamp and that comes up next.\n\nBootcamp - I installed Windows 7 using bootcamp on MBP. I observed that Windows 7 is slow and the hard disk makes squeaky noises when you are trying to open an application in bootcamp, also the track pad experience is not the same despite the various drivers and the keyboard layout is obviously different. You can overcome these problems by connecting the MBP to a HDTV or any monitor and then using a wireless Windows keyboard + mouse but then the whole setup is too much hassle and defeats the purpose of a laptop.\n\nMicrosoft Office - The experience of using Microsoft Office on OS X is pretty subpar in comparison to Windows 7, may be it the fault of Microsoft but it is simply pretty hard for someone to transition from Office 2010 in Windows 7 to Office 2011 in OS X. For example, I am used to zooming in and out of Microsoft Word using shortcuts like Ctrl+Scroll Up (on trackpad) and Ctrl+Scroll Down but this option is not available as shortcut in the OS X version of Office. I wanted to type a formula for a cell in Excel and cannot find the formula bar. May be someone can help me if they know a way around enhancing this experience.\n\nDelete button - There is no substitute to Shift+Delete in OS X(CMD+del). Deletion followed by emptying trash is the only way to do it, if you are someone who is addicted to deleting the file at once there is no shortcut. CMD+SHIFT+DELETE is a shortcut to empty trash after you delete something (so two steps, not a major gripe).\n\nCut + Paste - There is no such option as 'Cut+Paste' in OS X. If you want to move something to a different folder, you have to copy and paste the file into the target folder and then delete the original from the source folder. Or select the file and carefully drag the file from the source into the target folder.\n\nPreview - Preview can be used to view PDF files and image files. Preview can also be used to make some markings in a PDF file, that is pretty cool. But what if I want to see all the pictures in a folder at once using preview, the only option is to select all the images and then right click to open with preview to see the files (In certain situations we can select all images and press space bar and the photos come in a stream slideshow. Also, every time you open a PDF or an image file the preview application becomes active, I would have preferred the application to quit automatically when I close the image). In summary, it is easier and cooler in Windows 7 to view images.\n\nSoftware Installation - There is no control panel in OS X. Just drag the application into the trash bin and it is gone. It has traces in your system but essentially it is gone for all practical purposes. I like this easy deletion aspect in OS X.\n\nWakeup time - The MBP is pretty fast on this aspect\n\nMountain Lion - Mountain Lion will provide you the option to wirelessely stream the content from your MBP to HDTV if you own a Apple TV (I do not know the other improvements, this stood out for me), something similar to the WiDi on the Windows laptops. Thats a really cool option, you do not need to have any HDMI cables at all to stream content.\n\n**HARDWARE\n\nTrack pad - This is something you would love to use and a big selling point, you can never think of going back to other laptops after using this. I always used a mouse on the Windows laptops but never even felt the need for a mouse on the MBP. The two finger swipe to scroll and three finger swipe that replace the 'Home' and 'End' buttons, pinch and zoom for PDF document and images are pretty cool options. I was pretty amazed at the track pad when I started learning more about the OS X.\n\nKeyboard - Keys are located spaciously. My previous two laptops frequently had dirt stuck in between the keys which used to drive me crazy.\n\nHeat - HP and Compaq laptops generate so much heat that you can use them as a personal heater (I used to do it). The whirring sound made by my Compaq laptop's heat fan used to be pretty embarrassing for me in my class or in the meetings, I hated opening the laptop. In a contrast, the MBP is very calm, the fan does go up occasionally when you run some intensive applications such as office (along with some other intensive applications) or play graphic video games but you will hardly notice it.\n\nBuild - Unibody aluminum build with just 10 screws at the back is something you would appreciate only when you have used other laptops made of plastic material that make creaky sounds every time you lift them. The upper lid of these other plastic material laptops tend to wobble a lot over time but the MBP's lid is pretty stiff even after 7 months of daily use (at least 3 hours a day).\n\nScreen - I personally like the fact there is no slight gap between the glossy screen and border of the lid. In other laptops dust gets stuck between the screen and the plastic and it could be really irritating when you cannot remove the dust. Screen quality, there are different manufacturers for the LCD screen, please search for 9CC3, 9CC5 and 9CC7 to know more about this. I have a 9CC3 (luckily) and it is supposed to be the best one available for a 13\" MBP.\n\nPorts - HDMI port is not available directly but you can buy a 10 feet long HDMI output cable for less than $20.\n\nDVD Drive - Other laptops tend to have DVD drive as an attachment but in a MBP it is inseparable (at least by the looks of it). The DVD drives on the two other laptops I owned before MBP used to make a quirky sound when I used to wake them up from sleep or do a restart, no such sounds on the MBP.\n\nBattery - The longest battery life out I could extract from MBP was about 6 hours with browsing. That is pretty good considering that other cheaper laptops can only last for 2.5 hours. Of course you can upgrade your battery on the other laptops but you need to compromise on the weight.\n\nPower Chord and Charger - One of my friends accidentally tripped over a $1000 Sony Vaio's power chord and the machine fell on the floor with brute force. I still remember how anxious he was till the machine powered up. This would not happen with a MBP, the chord attaches to the MBP with magnet, in case of an accident the power chord would detach itself and nothing would still happen to the MBP. The adapter is light weight and you can carry it in a backpack (no big bundles like the ones you see for HP and Dell).\n\nFunction Keys - I use the function keys in Windows 7 machines to close application, essentially which means that I am going to just use F4 for pressing Ctrl+F4 or Alt+F4. I like the Apple's way of function keys, pretty easy to use and only contains what we exactly need. Ctrl+F4 and Alt+F4 are replaced by CMD+W in OS X.\n\nWebcam - 720p & perfect for Skype.\n\nBacklit Keyboard - If you have not used one without a backlit keyboard before you will love this option.\n\nResale Value - Based on the eBay listings I can say that you could expect to recover 75% of the actual value of a MBP if you maintain it well (if sold within a year of purchase).\n\nApple Warranty - International warranty for 1 year + easy replacement within 3 months + Apple protection for 3 years for $200 (warranty is international again) is really worth it. I felt that my battery was losing its power quickly and Apple Store promptly replaced the battery for me.\n\nCons (the only one)\nSpeakers Sound - Sound is kind of low for me, I really wish that it was louder.\n\nSo to summarize I am impressed with the hardware by every bit and I really do not have any complaints about the hardware design.\n\n******************************************************************************\n\nIn conclusion, if you are going to use your laptop for Microsoft Office and want to connect to Windows machine through Remote Desktop or VPN, I would recommend not to jump the ship to OS X and instead consider other alternatives listed below. The experience of Microsoft Office, switching between applications and productivity is much better on Windows 7.\n\nI would still recommend a MBP if you want to buy a laptop for casual browsing and simple applications at home, the hardware design is pretty awesome and Apple support is trustworthy.\n\nAlternatives to consider - Similar hardware design with Windows 7 would be a very good combination and that brings me to Windows Ultrabooks. Ultrabooks are about the same price (or in some cases cheaper than MBP), faster with a SSD and are very appealing with Windows 8 soon on the cards. I read on tech websites that HP Envy Spectre 14, Lenovo U300S, Asus Zenbook, HP Folio 13, Dell XPS and Samsung Series 9 are pretty well built like a MBP but run on Windows 7. Samsung Series 9 looks pretty good and has a 15\" option as well, so thats some good news if you are a Windows fan."}

Their automated phone support system doesn't work and took me half of an hour to get a person who then told me he couldn't help me because that was a different department. They gave a $100 gift card with the Mac which didn't work (even though at Coffee Bean, Starbucks, etc. I've NEVER had issues with gift cards). Now the laptop itself dies after one week.  I'm forced to deal with this company because I teach programming, but it's beyond me how this company has grown to the size it has.  The laptop is twice as expensive as an equivalent Windows laptop and three times as expensive as an equivalent linux laptop.\n\nHow does this company stay in business? Especially a tech company that can't its tech right!  I love and use linux. I use Windows and it works. So far all I've seen from Apple is terrible support people and a terrible product."}

For the most part they have treated me well. But when it really came down to it they just were not very reliable. Sound board stopped working and the internal fans never seemed to keep the laptops cool enough.  I say all that to say this. Switching computer brands is one thing, but switching your OS is a much bigger step. This is the step i finally took. After buying a new Macbook Pro 13in I can say it has been the best purchase in electronics i have ever made. I am a man who loves to research and in all my searching I could not find a computer that is an equal to the macbook pro.\n\nI am 100% pleased with this purchase. It was far more then i though it would be.\n\nIf you have any worries about buying it from Amazon just make sure that the one you are buying is sold by Amazon and not a 3rd party seller.  Amazon always has a cheaper price then most sellers and is a safe way to purchase your new apple product.\n\nEnjoy!"}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "This is not my first Mac computer, and certainly will not be my last. Before I begin, I will say that I am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - I am not an Apple fanboy. I have owned many PC computers as well, and like them too. I currently own a Lenovo laptop as well as my new MacBook Pro, and each have their own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nTo start with the strengths:\n1. OSX Lion is a great performer..extremely fast and reliable. I have it installed on my iMac desktop computer as well and love it. Not to mention this comes with a free upgrade to Mountain Lion, which is very nice.\n2. Screen looks great. Even though it is not the Retina display you can get on the 15.4 inch model, the screen is fantastic. Very bright and crystal clear with excellent color.\n3. Quietest laptop I have ever owned. Keeps quiet even when the computer is under a heavy load.\n4. First computer I have owned with USB 3.0. I bought an external hard drive when I purchased this laptop as well so I could utilize the USB 3.0. I got the hard drive yesterday and transferred all of my files from my old laptop to the new hard drive so I could put them on my MacBook. It took about 1/5th of the time it did with USB 2.0.\n5. My Lenovo laptop does not have an illuminated keyboard, so the keyboard on this laptop is a big plus in my opinion. Excellent for people that like to work or surf the web while their significant other is sleeping.\n6. The trackpad - can't even compare it to any trackpad I have seen on any other laptop computer.\n7. Excellent battery life while being a very fast performer. It definitely has the best of both worlds. I average about 6 hours on a charge. My Lenovo (with similar graphics, processor, etc. and same use) only lasts about 4 or 5 hours on a full charge.\n8. Typical Apple simplistic styling. I love the look of the Apple products. Simple and clean.\n9. Many, many more...but those are the most notable ones to me.\n\nNow, for the weaknesses.\n1. The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip. They may get softer and more sticky as time goes by, but right now they are far from that. The pads on the bottom of my Lenovo are definitely much better and don't allow the computer to slide around while I am using the computer on a glass topped desk.\n2. Price - it's a bit pricey for the performance you get, but the added perks of Mac OSX and the durability and support of Apple products makes up for it. For the same price, you can get a PC with more memory, larger hard drive, better graphics, and a faster processor, but then you remember you're running Windows 7, which isn't nearly as well built as Mac OSX.\n\nIn conclusion - this is a great laptop. Although it is a little pricey, it is well worth the extra money. So far, the only issue I have with it (rubber pads) is a very small problem that does not change how this laptop performs in any way.\n\nIf you are thinking about getting a MacBook Pro laptop but do not want to spend a huge amount of money for one, this is definitely the way to go. It may be considered the \"base model\" MacBook Pro, but it still an excellent computer. The size and battery life of this computer makes it excellent for people that need a laptop that is very mobile. Between work and college classes, I needed a lightweight yet durable computer and this definitely fits that criteria.\n\n9.5/10"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "My first impressions:\n\nI used to own a unibody (2009) core2duo. Theres about few major differences from the upgrade that I noticed.\n\nFirst the fan noise. I light whisper. My old device had no sound at all, but suffered from heat issues watching flash videos, then when stressed more the fan would get very loud. However this new model (which may be similar to the i5 series CPU) runs cool and more constant. I suspect its fan is different it idles at 2000rpm.\n\nThe CPU,  the difference isn't always apparent but does perform well so far and is noticeable watching videos. Ill need to play with it more before i can really say more. Originally I had interest in a MacBook air but didn't want to get an even weaker device than the base series pro,  since apples products are underpowered to begin with and I recall the AIR isn't user upgradable (unless I'm wrong?) I felt this model was best. And I could most likely upgrade ram to 16gb (still have to confirm this is possible on this release)\n\nLastly battery sustains itself ever so slightly better. My older device battery health hardly deteriorated (4%) and this guy seems to cruise smoothly without significant drain."}

Like me, for most people, this computer is expensive, but its great quality and value in the long run. The only thing I don't like is the volume settings, the volume is really low on this version or maybe all versions, but I wish the speakers could be even more louder so I don't have to plug in head phones or external speakers all the time when watching movies, listening to songs, or etc. The chargers are expensive to replace, so I suggest buying at least two so you'll have a back up in case your's stops working (which it won't for a long long time) or in case you forget yours. The only thing is the price, everything is super expensive from maintenance to chargers to accessories, but worth every penny when you can have your computer for more than 5 years straight!"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "Got this in March 2016. It was sluggish from day one. Unresponsive at times, and persnickety trackpad at all times. It overreacts whenever there is any moisture in the air or lotion on hands, even after an hour of it absorbing into skin. I gave up using hand lotion because this trackpad would flip the H out. It would move on its own and click through screens like a demon possessed  wackadoo. Ok...so almost two years since I've had it and how many effing times do you think the blessed hard drive crashed? Hmmm? Three. Three times. In 23 months. This final time, I refuse to fix it. Why bother? It has been a poorly functioning shadow of what I once thought a Mac was capable of. And the attitude of the quote/unquote \"Genius Bar\" technician was apathetically unsympathetic. She said this was to be expected because \"things happen\" and had zero reply when I expressed how much I lost faith and trust in Apple products. Well you know what goes well with Apples? Grits. As in, kiss my grits, Apple. You lost a loyal customer."}

Didn't come in a box (don't care as much because I paid for a laptop not a box). The computer seemed to work fine. I had issues syncing my iPhone. It took me a few hours to resolve this issue. The first few hours of receiving this laptop gave me more problems than I thought. Upon further inspection I realized that 3 keys were unresponsive ( 4, F4, & R). This frustrated me so much because my wifi password required some of the faulty keys. It's a shame that I am returning this product because I thought it would last me a while.

A month into having it, it started spontaneously turning off. It was still under warranty at the time, and I took it to Apple, where they stated it was a defective computer. They replaced it with a new \"motherboard\" which is basically the brain of the computer, as they explained. It worked for about 6 more months and then started doing it again. It has gotten to the point that I cannot turn it off, because often times it won't turn back on. Yesterday, I went to update it to see if this would make it better, and it won't turn back on and I have it with my tech guy who said it is completely defective. I am extremely upset, as I am a physician and use apple products for everything. I looked up more reviews as I realize I got scammed, and voila, there are several similar poor reviews similar to mine.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I have just received the product today. This is my first time purchasing an Apple product so it is going to take some time getting used to it. The original computer I had has been running slow and gradually falling apart. It has lasted for some years and has served me well during most of my college years. I wanted to invest in another laptop to get me through the months I have left in college as well as post-college. I heard Macs last for a strong durability but I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for it. In addition to, I wanted one I could play movies from and something that was easy to upgrade if needed.\nIt is my first day using it, so I may update this review later, but overall everything is running like new. It came with a few scratches on the body but nothing to interfere with the performance. I hope to upgrade the RAM and HDD to a SSD. I won't do that until I am comfortable using the laptop first and see how it functions without it (just to see if it is worth the investment). The size is perfect and the screen and keyboard show no signs of wear. I am very pleased with my purchase from a third-party seller. I was worried I had spent money on something worthless but my worries have been put to rest. The product from the third-party seller I got it from arrived much sooner than expected.\nCall me crazy but buying a used laptop is quite the risk. You never know what you are going to get but I am glad I took a leap of faith. Now I just need to add Microsoft Word and personalize my laptop with a protective case! You can't beat a great Apple laptop for less than $500!\n&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Apple-MacBook-Pro-13-3-Inch-Laptop-Intel-Core-i5-4-GB-DDR3-RAM-500-GB-HDD-Mac-OS-X-Silver/dp/B0074703CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Apple MacBook Pro 13.3-Inch Laptop (Intel Core i5, 4 GB DDR3 RAM, 500 GB HDD, Mac OS X), Silver</a>"}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "My first time owning a Mac, and I mainly got it because of that finger swiping shortcut to change desktops lol. I mostly do coding or use the internet, so I just wanted something simple and straightforward. No one uses a CD slot these days anyway, haha. Learning new keyboard shortcuts was hard though :(\n\nBUT THEN!!!\nComputer crapped out after like 3 months which really sucked. After having it for almost three weeks, there were a couple instances where it would randomly turn off. I just kinda brushed it off, but then a few more weeks later, it started happening more. Took it to Apple store where they open it and show me it had some kinda sticky liquid damage (like soda??....), and I told them that must've happened a long time ago. Apple stores will only fix liquid damaged products if you pay them a huge fee to completely rebuild it for you.... I was able to make do for a couple more months, but it got to the points where it wouldn't stay on for longer than five mins. I wish I had just returned it when it first started acting up.\n\nThe lesson I'm trying to teach here is: If you're gonna buy used, you should only buy it certified refurbished from the official Apple website. Used laptops from other people is just way too much risk in my opinion. I'm actually on a refurbished MacBook air right now, haha. The 2015 model was only $100 more than what I paid for the 2013 Pro... and like I said, I use this to access the internet like 95% of the time. Having a lighter and more portable laptop is more important. (and battery!) Both are 13\" which I think is the best size. The MacBook Pro is a good laptop, but for the majority of\nus, we're gonna get enough functionality out of the Air. Except the laptop charger for the air sucks bc it connects via magnet but if u even bump into it, it falls of smh.\n\nOkay, if u actually read this, thanks. And wow, there's a surprise 2nd lesson here: don't hesitate to use that return button. Online shopping is risky, but that's why they have a customer service center!!\n\nAnd p.s.: that third mac was one I bought of eBay. thankfully it arrived, but of course, it turned into snail-mail pace a week later."}

I cannot believe anything computer sold in 2016 is this slow! I opened the box today and I was excited. I took the day off work. I went to the Apple Store to get assistance with the device. The Genius was working on the newer model of this device while I was setting this one up. It took him a nano second while it took me a 25 seconds to do the same thing. I try to open 1 app and it just sits. It was ridiculous.  Finally after 2 hours we got all my settings completed (One Drive, Office 365 and Chrome, Gmail). I asked a Genius why my device was so slow. He said that this device has the older chipset. I said I knew that but my goodness. He showed me a demo in the store of this device against the newer one. There was no comparison on speed. I was so disappointed. I am a Windows user and I was ready to convert. Most reviews I saw were really good. I don't want this to happen to anyone else so I am writing this review.\n\n- My current machine is a Dell XPS i7 Quad Core. I don't know why I thought I could go down to an i5 dual core. The price was too tempting. I was on the phone with Apple Support for 30 minutes trying to uninstall applications. I decided to do a factory reset and call it a night. I have been trying to set this device up for 10 hours. I am so over it. If speed is what you need this is not the device.\n\n- The Genius also told me that a lot of educational institutions buy this model. Not power users.\n- Please go the the Apple store and use this device beside the one without the DVD drive that is SSD."}

The machine so good for our daily needs as well as our professional needs such as video editing, music editing, photo editing etc. I'm not much of a gamer so i don't have much knowledge in that area. Eventhough this machine has no retina display, it won't make any much of a difference who has never used a retina display before. The machine is running on a 3rd Generation Intel Core-i5 processor which is one of the prominent battery efficient and performance based processor from Intel. For someone who doesnt want to spend so much money but want to taste the actual Apple software and hardware, i would say, i'm in this category and this is the machine for people just like me."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "Before I get tons of objections on how i can say it's the best Macbook ever made -- first we need to consider who this macbook would be best for.  If you are a road warrior -- you should probably get an Macbook Air or one of the latest new thin Macbook laptops. However, if this is for the family or your grandmother and you just want it to last a long time.. This is the Macbook for you.. but it will likely be discontinued fairly soon since this model has been in production since 2008!\n\nWho should get one?\n1 - If you need lots of HDD space (e.g 1TB) since it's fairly easy to install a replaceable HDD drive.  Most Macbook these days take SSD modules which are hard to replace. This macbook takes standard SATA drives which keep coming down in price.\n2- Upgradable RAM.  It comes with 4GB of RAM but for less than $100, you can get 4x the amount installed (16GB) which is more than enough for any application\n3- You have lots of photos or music to store.  As stated above, the ability to just keep upgrading the HDD to something large is really valuable.  Our laptops have been upgraded several times but they are about 8 years old and still running quite well.\n4-  It actually has a DVD player.. for those who have kids or grandparents-- it's great to be able to burn some CDs or photos\n5- Durable.  My family has a tendency to kill laptops but even they have not been successful to kill these things yet.  thank god..\n6- Upgradability - It's best feature is the ability upgrade the HDD and RAM which allows you to get a mac with more storage than most new macbooks today in a cost effective way.\n\nWho should NOT get this laptop:\n1- You are going to use it for gaming\n2- You need to tons of battery life and need something really light\n3- You do not need that much storage space for photos\n\nIn summary: it's a fantastic laptop and i'll be sad when Apple stops selling it.  It is getting long in the tooth in performance so that day is coming soon but this is the only machine i've had for 8 years and have been able to get more life out of it with some simple upgrades in RAM, Battery, or HDD."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "While I'm new to this particular device and OS I do find that this laptop functions wonderfully for my daily needs. The design is pretty solid and of prior laptops or netbooks I've used in the past, I find that the trackpad is very responsive and makes me feel less awkward at falling back on my failsafe of connecting a wireless USB mouse. Normally I find my ability to navigate highlighting and selecting options within pages, programs or web browsers difficult on most laptop trackpads, but this one is very responsive to allow ease of use. Also the spacing is good to prevent the issues I've normally found at my wrists occasionally hitting the pad and moving my cursor to areas outside of the normal workspace while typing for long periods. As I'm still feeling my way around the applications that are available from the initial OS after it's turned on and set-up, it appears to come with many of the basic programs I need to get to work. The first-time set-up feels a bit intrusive to me about wanting me to set up accounts with logins (at least in my opinion) but that appears to be standard for the Apple OS and outside of that sets itself up for standard use reasonably quick after a couple reboots. I'm not too keen with the constant updates I've seen as of late, however even Linux had regular updates which I got used to over time and with the Mac OS being based from a UNIX build, it will likely have the same regular updates. At least I can elect when I'm doing them versus the machine OS (usually I've found the Windows OS to have this characteristic) constantly popping up with a notification to the point of intruding upon work and forcing me to forego finishing the last of a current project to update. I'm pleased and a bit in awe at how the battery holds a charge for a long period of time and charges up very quickly. Overall this laptop build is solid and reliable from what I've experienced so far and hope that this continues to be for many years to come. So if one is in the market for a laptop I would recommend this one for consideration, even if it's not the latest and greatest model, it's a pretty solid machine. It was initially a bit more than I was hoping to spend, but considering that this unit contains a 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 Processor, 4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 Memory, and Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB -- this functions for my basic use and more. It might even be able to handle some minor music and visual work, but I would consider one of their Apple drives in the future for something along this line. The laptop is slim and easy to fit on the go which is another feature I do enjoy and will even conserve the battery charge without shutting off the machine when relocating to another work area. The battery use drains slower when the lid is closed versus letting the device go into standby with the top up and I appreciate the attention to this detail as it responds differently depending on which method the laptop goes to sleep. If the laptop top is up when it goes to sleep, it runs a bit of processing resources in the background to allow you to log back into the machine a bit more quickly upon hitting the power key. When waking the machine up from a closed top position, the unit has to recognize and restart a bit of the processing before you are allowed to log back into the device but it does not consume as much if any of the battery while in this mode. I noticed this when traveling from home to the library and not wanting to fully shut down the unit for the drive an exit away -- I was concerned that I would need to plug in the charger upon arriving but found that the laptop held the charge without dropping in percentage of use. Often with other laptop or netbooks I've used in the past there would be a reasonable amount of drain to the battery in the same distance of that trip, so that was a pleasant surprise. The Mac OS (El Capitan on this machine) seems to manage its energy resources very well as I often have multiple tabs open in browsers for research while writing and only when the laptop gets to about 5% will it pop up a warning to charge the unit. I've even found that it will still manage the drain of energy use on the battery that I don't see a risk of saving and backing up my work when it gets to that level. Like I said, I'm new to this device and OS type, but it has impressed me and I'm very pleased with this laptop."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "All updated hardware except for the processor and ram. The processor is 2.5Ghz and plenty fast with a turbo mode to 3.1Ghz.\nright now you can take this one and the three higher priced in sequence and it goes from;\nthis model Model: MD101LL/A 500GB HHD\nModel: MF839LL/A $1299.99 128GB SSD 8 gig ram\nModel: MF840LL/A $1499.99 256GB SSD 8 gig ram\nModel: MF841LL/A $1799.99 512GB SSD 8 gig ram\n\nThe only difference is that they have a Retina display which isn't an improvement unless you use the highest resolution and that makes the print smaller also it improves it so well but the human eye can only detect so much of the improvement if any. The other differences are the SSD solid state drives which is actually a thumb drive that is faster higher capacity more than the regular thumb drives. The three other models are all identical except as shown the drives take a step up on each model.\n\nYou can swap the drives but the ram is soldered and cannot be upgraded to 16 gig which all of the listed models are capable of using, I install 16Gigs of PNY Ram for 55$ and installed a PNY SSD 240GB drive for 59$, if you take any of the other models listed you will not find any significant differences in the operation of this MBP. NONE!. It has the same hardware except for the processor and Ram, it has the USB3 ports, 4.4 Bluetooth and the list just goes on.\nI have not yet heard the fan come on and I get over 9 hours of battery surfing the web, the bottom of the computer doesn't even get warm, its amazing!\n\nYou hear from those that just do not realize that this isn't the same model as the 2012 model it came out with, it has that in it's name to describe the MB. No it's not four years old, mine was made in May 2016 & I bought it in June, take your serial number to the Apple site and you can get a build date. This is also the only MB that has a DVD/RW for those that need to create Logs, backups and Movies etc.\nIf you do not want the DVD you can add another SSD with no GB limit for 40$ plus the drive in it's place and get an external DVD or keep it and get an external SSD.\nI cannot speak highly enough for this MBP, it is by far the best one you can upgrade for your hard earned money if you just use it for photo editing and internet operations. I paid 899$ on sale, SSD 59$ and the 16 gig ram 55$ and got a monster of a MacBook Pro for 1013$."}

That's like going to purchase a brand new car and the engine is permanently welded to the car. So if it fails you have to buy a whole new one.\nAnyway, This Macbook Pro is still an excellent buy, and you can upgrade this machine to be as fast or even faster than the new ones!

If you are looking to play games, or do anything at lightning speeds go buy a nice gaming computer for the same price. At this point, my space bar is half broken because i took it off once, it sometimes gets confused as to whether the computer is open or closed, and sometimes it just refuses to turn on for no clear reason. Once you get it running though, it works great, the trackpad is one of the best i have ever used, and the screen and everything works great. I don't suggest turning it off very often because it will be an eternity before you will actually be able to use it. As long as you don't have super high expectations for its longevity, you will be perfectly happy with it, but it certainly doesnt last as long as the price tag suggests it should. I suggest looking at something like the predator 15, which is a much better laptop for the same price."}

But, since almost all PC laptops are so bad nowadays, I forced myself to switch because Apple seems to be the best brand.  However, even the best are often not without their drawbacks and problems.  There are tons of little issues that really do add up very fast and make for a crappy computing experience.  The vertical scrolling is very sticky.  There is not Start button.  Finding files is a pain.  I installed Firefox and yet the icon doesn't even come up on the bottom toolbar until I go to 'Finder' and open it from there.  It's all just very user-unfriendly.  Oh, and as for internet connection settings - you really have to dig in order to get to them.  I could go on for hours.\n\nI had photoshop and many other programs on my old computer (which completely died, and I can not use it anymore) and I am still transitioning.  I think I'm gonna have to get another PC laptop to do a few things that I used to do on my old HP.  I don't want to buy Photoshop again and was really pissed that Adobe does not allow for downloading the Mac version after buying the PC version...that's how they stay a rich company I guess.  Oh well.\n\nI don't think I'm ever going to be a full-fledged, flag-waving Apple user.  But, at least the computer is pretty well guaranteed to last and the only way it would break is if you were to drop it off a skyscraper.\n\nUPDATE: I bought a Dell because I got so pissed off with my Apple.  It's far easier to use.  I'm still doing about one-third of my computing on the Apple but I'm always going to be a PC user.  As I always say, \"No, I prefer Oranges to Apples.\""}

( SSD and Memory )\n\nI bought my Macbook Pro 13 Mid-2012 edition for $500 ( slightly used / Like NEW condition from Amazon.com ).\nI upgraded it with 16gb. of ram ($60) and a 500gb. Samsung Evo 850 SSD ($150) Total price with upgrades = $710. I used boot camp and created (2) 250gb. partitions and now run MS Windows-10 and OS-X El Capitan. I have them loaded with most Apple apps and Windows programs from MS Office/Adobe CS6 suite/Video and Audio editing apps and programs, etc... The OS with apps only took up about 120gb. on each partition, So a 500gb. SSD was big enough. This Macbook 13 Mid-2012 edition is the Best deal you can get right now on a Macbook Pro. With the upgrades this Macbook performs very well.\n\nUpgraded Macbook Benchmarks:\nSSD benchmarks are 500 mb/s - write, and 513 mb/s read.\nWifi-ac = 1300 mb/s\nNova Benchmarks are 709\nMemory Speed - 7498 mb/s\nGeekbench score = 2583 single core and 5321 multi-core.\nCinebench score = 15.70 fps and 246 CPU\nGraphics - Intel HD 4000\nDisplay = 1280 x 800 non-retina, Or 2560 by 1600 pixels on an external display\nBattery Life - 7 hours\nCPU - Intel i5-3210M , 2-cores and 4-threads.\nWebcam - SUCKS !, Terrible webcam !...( Buy a Logitech C920 1080p Webcam replacement).\n\nThese are not the greatest benchmark scores for a $710 notebook.\nA $500 Windows notebook with a Haswell Intel-i5 or i7 CPU will perform much better.\nHowever is you want OS-X apps and MS Windows programs on one notebook this Macbook Pro 13 is the way to go.\nMS Windows-10 runs very well on this upgraded Macbook. The main reason I did not buy a New model Macbook Pro is because the Webcams SUCK !

First, no laptop can match this device.  It is superior in all aspects.  I have had some similar difficulties as the one I returned, but guess this is Apple's doing and has nothing to do with the laptop.  Again, this laptop is outstanding.  I have had outstanding phone support from Apple representatives and it is helping me use the laptop so much better.  I intend to call them as much as possible during my 90 support time, taking notes, and allowing me to understand the system better.

The hardware is nice , laptop has a little wait to in , build in battery if you never had anything apple, but I would suggest getting some type of skin/protection gear for the outside. The MacBook is easy to pick up scratches or marks on the outside. Not because the hardware is cheap , it's something that happens over time. has many different commands on its software that makes it easy to navigate between programs, has huge music store available , plays cd/dvds, has burner for music never tried to burn dvds.\nI love my MacBook the reason why I went out my way to write to review"}

Have been having issues with the keyboard since updating the OS to OS X El Capitan 10.11.2.  Bought 3-year extended coverage with the AppleCare Protection Plan & with Square Trade as well.  Neither were ever activated, and I didn't find that out until recently.  Apple told me to go back to Amazon & it would get resolved.  Square trade gave me a partial refund, but would not put the coverage into effect even though I had over a year left, and they never did anything on the AppleCare Protection.....no refund, no protection.  Not happy with Amazon or Apple on those matters.  I am just out almost $420.00 (minus the $70 refund Square Trade issued me, out of $177+ purchase) Not sure I will ever buy an Apple product again, because of this.  That is a lot of money to have thrown away.  My computer isn't even 2.5 years old yet, and it has some issues that need work, yet I am going to have to pay for it out of pocket, even though I paid for full coverage.  BE AWARE, and make sure your coverage is activated immediately!"}

His comments are always stable, great features such as skye, wi-fi great, and easily portable.  Big enough to work on but not to bulky for carrying to class.  Based on others who I know that have these MacBooks, longivity and stability are as good after 8 years as when they originally bought theirs.  I'm not a fan of Apple and personally prefer Windows/Android systems, but must give it a THUMBS UP as to the quality.  A final thing I do like about these is the fact that I've never heard of anyone getting a VIRUS with an Apple product, thus saving some money on all the antivirus programs."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I have been an avid Apple user for close to a decade now. This specific Macbook Pro is the latest model that I own and have owned it brand new since 2013. This computer has been used both for personal use and professionally flawlessly. I have only had one minor issue with this but once figured out, I have haven't had any problems with it since and it was my own fault to begin with as I used a generic usb cord to charge a non Apple product through the usb port on the side of this Macbook Pro. The computer would randomly shut down and the only way I could turn it back on was to open the back, remove the battery, hold down the power button for 10 secs to reset it, replace the battery, and then it would turn back on as if nothing happened in the first place. Once I switched and started using a certified Apple usb cord, I haven't had that problem since. This computer packs some mega power and can run several programs simultaneously without any problems. In fact, I have used this model with Logic Pro music producing software, Aperture photography software, Firefox with a dozen open tabs, Utorrent file sharing software, and many, many others running in the background and there is absolutely no obvious signs of slowed processor. I have owned several other Apple products through the years and I have no doubts that this specific model will last me 20+ years if I kept it that long! It would obviously be pretty obsolete by that time but you get the point. Hope this review helps. If you are considering buying a new Apple laptop, look no further...the price vrs comparison can't be beat and you won't regret it!"}

I asked about getting some information on the MacBook and he said he would help me to get this information but he then put me in touch with his boss.  Several minutes later he came on the phone and told me how to get a password to work.  He then said \"very tersely that now I had a password and hung up.

I had a MC374LL/A I loved in all areas except for overheating, so when I got this MD101LL/A, I put it through it's paces. And guess what? It runs El Capitan as well as it can (given that the El Capitan is designed for Retina hardware & I need better implementations of the Retina Display to \"upgrade\" to Retina-class hardware. That said, I love how El Capitan has Aero Peek, Snap, Shake, and translucent menu & title bars in most applications (Safari doesn't appear to do it, but a lot of other stuff does) like Windows 7, because of the fact that while I always wanted to like Mac OS X, there was going to need to b importation of all the features I loved from Windows 7 to get me to get another Mac. Now that I see that Apple has finally listened, I can use Intel Macs again. And they so much now are as good as they were promised to b the first time around, except for El Capitan breaking my MacBook Pro's advanced features for all these mirages & shell games. I want Retina Display hardware yes, but I want it to look like the non-Retina unibody predecessors.\n\nPipe dreaming I know, but I want to dream of what I should have instead of what I do.\n\nUpdate 2-4-2016:\n\nIt is the ultimate laptop. Running El Capitan, it has shelved the best PC competition and proven why Macs are worth more-I just can't say for much that they are worth as much as their Classic Mac OS forebears, but that's a manner of taste. I love driving the MacBook Pro and getting the chance to experience what makes Apple products great even now-with the iMac back in the house, I'm really cooking with gas."}
{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "Very good little puter. I have a few laptops and one with Windoz 10. But I then decided to buy this Mac because it is upgradable for one. Has optical drive. And I like the fact that I wanted to play around with the os. I am a cross platform kind of guy when it comes to playing computer buds. Also I had found out that  you can upgrade to 16 gigs of ram, even though it may say it only will take up to 8. Well then there is the display. No retina display? Well then who cares anyway at this price point? Also this display looks great too. :-) Upgrading is very easy and easy to get to the hardware. I have a lot of extra hybrid drives lying around. So maybe I will swap out the drive. Other then that it is very nice quality build and worth the price. The newer Macs of today are very fast and nice. But you can't upgrade the hardware as the flash drive and memory are surface mounted like tablets and phones are today. No optical drive anymore on the new Macs. But that all depends on the person's wants in a computer that will work for there needs. So if your a tech kind of person who does not mind taking things apart and upgrading the hardware. This is the one that is the most wanted for the old school hardware tweaking. So I think that if you have not decided on what to buy? Then I would buy a Alienware laptop. I have one of those too and I have to say it rocks and looks great to. Love the color changing keyboard. Great gaming computer too. Enough said. good luck and buy a MacBook Pro 2012. I love mine. :-)"}

I may upgrade the RAM in the future, but for what I currently use it for it is fine. I would highly recommend getting a mac if you use any of their products. It really works great with iPhone and iPad because they all become integrated, which for me is very nice. I also enjoy the simplicity of using the Mac. It did take a bit to get my bearings but once I did, I can't believe it has taken me this long to surrender to the MacBook. I guess it is because I was raised on Microsoft, but now with the windows updates which are unbearable it is a nice time to switch. Please, just get it, and don't compromise.

What a mistake!\n\nMy Macbook crashed on me after less than 6 months, taking me 8-10 hours to read forums, reinstalling the OS, and recovering from a Time Machine backup. I have spent an additional 50-60 hours on the phone partitioning my Macbook's hard drive, backing up my data, wiping the hard drive clean, and reinstalling MacOS and transferring my data after the piece of junk locked-up again. I had to deal with chronic slowness and THE BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH on my PC, but NEVER HAD A COMPUTER CRASH in the decades of using non-Apple products!\n\nI expressed my dismay with each of the 10-15 Apple employees I have spoken to and they only confirmed my concerns ... APPLE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS AND REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN PLACATE ME. As an Apple investor and American consumer, I am appalled by the lack customer service and support I have experienced at the hands of another institution that terrorizes consumers with impunity. Needless to say, I will never spend another penny on Apple products. All consumers and shareholders should be warned and concerned.\n\nI am done fighting with these people, will use my Mac until it dies (which should not take long based on my experience), and will go back to a Windows or Android-based phone and a non-Apple computer when they do ... FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU; FOOL ME TWICE ... AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN APPLE!\n\nCombatCritic Gives Apple, Inc. 1 Out of 10 Bombs for their poor products, customer service, and judgment ... More Bombs Are Better!"}

This little gem just puts the cherry on top as far as I am concerned.  No problem with the learning curve and a definite plus for me was being able to get perhaps the last model with an optical drive.  Yeah, I still enjoy using my CD's and DVD's.\n\nMine came with OS Yosemite and at present see no reason to move to the next iteration.  I am not that well versed to understand much less explain why Apple seems to think it is necessary to have so many iterations of their operating systems.  But that is another subject for which the Geeks of the World most assuredly can/will jump on.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "The MacBook Pro with a 13.3-inch screen was the first computer I ever purchased. I had heard people speak highly of the MacBook Pro for college students, and have not been disappointed through two and a half years of extensive use. The MacBook Pro is useful for college students for many reasons:\n It is the cheapest product in the line of MacBooks\n The new operating system called Snow Leopard is installed and ready for use\n The battery life has increased from the last version from 4 hours to 7 hours, making it easy for college students to study for extended periods of time without needing a charger.\n\nThe criteria that I used to evaluate the MacBook Pro ranges from Reliability to simple Usability:\n Reliability: Throughout the past few years, I have had no problems with the MacBook Pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws.\n Durability: My computer has fallen from small heights and has had a few spills on it, but has had no lasting damage to the console with only a light plastic case on it. There are also many carrying cases to purchase to have extra protection.\n Visibility: The screen has brightness settings that can be changed to fit different peoples needs, also the retina display is available for an extra cost if students need a higher quality of display.\n Usability: The MacBook Pro is very easy to use and can be used by someone who doesnt necessarily have extensive knowledge on computers. The processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly.\n\nThe MacBook Pro has a significant amount of positive attributes that greatly outweigh the negative attributes:\n Pros:\no It usually runs very smoothly, but Apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers.\no It is very cost efficient for college students compared to other options.\no It has an extended battery life.\no It is extremely user friendly.\n Cons:\no Some people don't enjoy the way the processing system runs, but don't have any issues with getting it to function.\no Others have problems with the applications depending what they need to use the device for, for example engineering majors need extra applications & systems to do some work, but they are easily downloadable.\n\nI hope my customer review has been useful, feel free to respond with opinions or feedback about the content of my review."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I'm actually writing this review on my new MacBook and I love it! The seller was great and I had my computer within 2 days. The computer it self is amazing. It is an older model, so know that upfront, but it is everything I was looking for. I wanted a laptop that had a CD drive, since most new laptops do not have one, a laptop with an actual hard drive, since the new MacBooks do not, and I wanted to get away from PCs. I actually spent $600 on a PC before I bought this MacBook and returned it with 24 hours because it was slow, and I could not stand windows 10. From the moment I received this MacBook it was like a dream come true. It is a little sluggish, which was to be expected with the 4GB ram, but even at its sluggish it is faster than the PC I bought. I know once I upgrade the ram to 8GB it will pick up a lot. As an added bonus I plan on upgraded to 16GB down the road, but 8 will do for now. The price for the ram is about $80 so this lap top is still cheaper than a brand new MacBook. Also, if after reading some reviews and doing some research I found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus. So long story short, if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop. I know people were complaining that it isn't the newest model, but it all depends on what you are looking for. It's the perfect size for someone who is using a laptop for school or everyday use, and while it is a little heaver than the MacBook Air, at 5ish pounds, its really not that bad. I highly recommend!!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I bought this laptop in August, 2012. It was a great laptop then and it's still a great laptop. I've NEVER owned a laptop for 4 years, most are replaced in the 2-3 year range (with typical MS Windows PCs). I've decided that I'm going to go for 5 year with this laptop. There's not enough performance increase in the newer models to warrant a new purchase. Instead I did a couple upgrades which I'll describe below. It still performs really well (and extremely well after my upgrades). It's my daily grinder and will continue to be for a couple more years hopefully. It is by far the best computer I have ever owned.\n\nPros\n- Solid processor--performance has been great\n- 500GB good size drive\n- OS is awesome\n- Battery life has been and remains pretty good\n- This is one of the MOST upgradeable Mac laptops that you could ever purchase. Opening it up and working on it is easy.\n- Hardware/construction is top notch--touch, feel and execution of the details of the device are just great.\n- Has lots of useful ports (if you're an IT pro, they come in useful); multiple USB ports, Thunderbolt, SD card, ethernet and CD/optical drive\n- The Apple store helped me troubleshoot a hardware issue even after warranty was over (took less than 10 minutes), but they were helpful.\n- Was relatively lightweight at purchase. Machines have gotten lighter since, but I still don't think that it's heavy.\n- 13.3 inch is the perfect laptop size in my opinion.\n\nCons\n- The memory is not enough (upgraded to 8GB at first and now 16GB). 4GB is too little memory for the device.\n- My biggest complaint has been that when it wakes up from sleep mode, it's a little slow to do so. I've fixed that (will explain).\n- It's not a retina display. I don't have a need for it, but may as well state that. When I bought the device, the 13 inch retina was not available.\n- I've had what I consider a minor repair to the hardware, which I completed. Specifically, the original hard drive went out after about 2-years of usage. I replaced the hard drive and SATA cable I believe for a $150-$180ish. I can't remember, but those would be cheaper today. I had a recent Time Machine backup. After I replaced the drive, I simply restored everything pretty easily. The hardest part of it was obtaining the SATA cable locally so that I wouldn't have to ship my machine. After I located it, I was able to restore and I might have lost a couple files, but nothing major.\n\nUpgrades\n- When new, I immediately upgraded the memory to 8GB. That was a significant performance increase in the machine. It's needed. I wouldn't consider this laptop without 8GB at a minimum.\n- I replaced the original hard drive after it failed (2 years) as noted above.\n- In May of 2015, I replaced the hard drive with a solid state drive (500GB) and added more memory (16GB).\n\nThe result of my hardware upgrade with the SSD drive simply helped me fall in love with this machine all over again. It wasn't that it particularly needed to have a new drive, but my wife got a new computer and I was getting the jones for a new machine. As a nerd, that happens. Instead I installed an SSD drive and it was a great move. It feels snappier all the way around and opening apps is fast. I really haven't measured the performance gain, but it felt 10-15% better. My wife has the newer 13.3 inch Mac with an SSD drive and my MD101 is so close in performance, you'd be hard pressed to notice any differences. The SSD drive also fixed the wake up issue. It wakes up much faster and it simply flies.\n\nWithout my upgrades, I was determined to keep the machine another year before passing onto my son (13 years old). Now, I feel like I'll get another couple years easy. The only thing that I can imagine is that the battery might start losing a bit of life, but if that happens, I'll pop open the machine and replace it. It's easy to work on. I love this machine and wouldn't hesitate to recommend the model to anyone.\n\nPS: My wife has a small firm and we've purchased six of these machines over the last few years. Only the machine noted above has ever had a hardware failure of any type and they have all been upgraded to 8GB of memory."}

After the newest OS--Sierra--I've had enough. If negative sales, Microsoft one-ups (+10), and planned obsolescence that would put Dubai to shame weren't enough, Sierra was launched. On the unsuspecting, and the expectant. And oh, did it tank. Steve Jobs was no prince, but he at least tested most of what Mac did before it was released. Now, it seems that developers are throwing feedback at their two-year-olds, and if they acknowledge, it's launched (an insult to two-year-olds). Nothing is thought through, the new releases offer gimmicky apps that are embarrassingly vacuous, and yet the company demands top dollar for it's products.

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "The most disappointing purchase of my life! This is my first Mac. I received a dud and have had nothing but problems since right after I purchased this horrible machine. Within the first few months that I bought it, there was clearly a problem with the hard drive. I had been in a training program and had only used Word on it. I went through all of the customer service options. The online customer service was awful. Gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile. No one would ever answer my question as to why I couldn't get another new Macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my Macbook was still under warranty. As a matter of fact, no matter how many times I asked that question, the employees I spoke purposely ignored it. They didn't say yes and they didn't say no, they just pretended that I never asked it, which was incredibly frustrating. I've been to the \"genius\" bar several times (they have been very nice). They have now basically replaced everything inside my machine, told me there was a problem with the hardware, so I now have a \"refurbished\" machine. Maybe I'm not being reasonable, but I don't feel that's the same as a new computer because I didn't pay for a refurbished computer. I still have weird freezing problems with it and it's pretty slow, but it's not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in. I had delusions of grandeur regarding Apple's \"great customer service\" and the \"reliability of their machines\" etc.. etc...blah...blah... I don't love PCs, but every PC I've ever owned has lasted longer than this Macbook, which costs much more than any of those Pcs. I'm sure most people's Macbooks work just fine, but FYI, if you get the factory dud, you're stuck with it and no one at Apple cares or will give a hoot about the money you threw away."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I had never used anything but Windows, but was compelled to buy this after hearing friends rave about the quality of Apple products.  Since my company was purchasing it, I wasn't concerned with the cost difference between PC/MAC.\n\nMy initial impression was that this laptop was constructed of much higher quality materials of most PCs.  Coming from Windows OS, it took some time to get used to OSX, but after some time using it I came to feel that the Apple experience is more intuitive and streamlined than Windows.  The gesture controls are amazing, and I find myself trying to manipulate Windows laptops using the gestures I have grown accustomed to in OSX.  After 4 years of having this laptop, I have never had an issue with programs getting hung, or the OS freezing like Windows.  As long as you do routine cleaning using the disc utility and install recommended updates, this laptop should run for years.\n\nThe App Store for Mac has plenty of gaming options, and Steam runs on MAC as well.  Setting up sharing between Windows and Mac is simple if you know what you're doing.  The awesome thing about Apple products is how seamlessly they integrate with each other.  The more Apple products you have, the better your experience will be.  The sync between my MacBook and iPad makes editing and viewing documents a breeze.\n\nI can go on and on about how the experience is so much better than Windows, and how you will love Mac.  However, for PC people, they will never be convinced of what Mac lovers already know.  For less money you can buy or build a Windows PC, or install an open-source Linux kernal; I personally have a HP Proliant server in my home running LTSP, with VM's running Windows, UbuntuStudio, Ubuntu, and Mint.  However, while I love my network, it took some time and effort to get it running the way I want it to.  For someone who wants the security and stability of Linux, but still want to maintain the user-friendliness they've come to know with Windows, you can't beat Mac.  Don't expect this to replicate a Windows experience, but if you take the time to learn the features of OSx, you will never regret the cost of this laptop.\n\nUnfortunately, my MacBook was run over by a car (long story), and my company bought me a PC as a replacement.  If I had the money, I would purchase another in a second, but have to give a four star review only because of the higher cost vs equivalent PC hardware."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I am a college student who has never owned an Apple computer prior to the one I currently have (purchased about one month ago).  I bought this computer after months and months of trying to decide if it was worth spending over $900 on a laptop.  After much consideration and reading many reviews, I decided to buy it off of Amazon, and I can say that I have not regretted that decision at all.  This computer is absolutely beautiful, both in the way in looks and the way it runs.  I have owned two laptops prior to my MacBook (both Windows) and I was never happy with either of them.  Internet pages would randomly freeze, programs would \"stop working\", and there seemed to be a new update every week that would take 15-20 minutes to complete.  I have had none of those issues with this MacBook Pro.  The performance is near flawless, and as an added bonus my Sims 3 games run even better on this laptop (which is not a gaming computer) than on my other laptop which was a so-called gaming PC.  Whether I'm surfing the web, playing games, watching movies, or doing schoolwork, this laptop surpasses my expectations.  If you're on the fence about purchasing this laptop because of the money, I say to go for it! I'm sure glad that I did."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I purchased this model, but returned it for the model with retina display and 256 gigs of storage.  This new computer was to replace a 5 year MacBook pro which had died.  The old computer had been declared \"vintage\" , and no parts are available.  The new computer under review is almost exactly like the 5 year old one except the processor has been upgraded.  The computer under review was introduced in 2012, so you are buying a new computer with 3 year old technology.  I told my self that since I had been satisfied with the broken computer (until it broke) that I would\nlike this on.  Except for a slight grinding noise on start-up it behaved exactly like the 5 year old one, which was satisfactory.  However, after carefully consideration I decided I should have purchased a computer with solid state storage and retina display.  I returned the computer under review and bought the latest MacBook Pro.  Wow, what a difference.  The new one is blazingly fast, although I find the retina display to be very little better.\n\nLet me summarize what I see as the advantages and disadvantages of each:\n\nOlder Model (still being sold as new)\nAdvantages:  Price\n  500 gig hard drive\n  Built in optical drive (CDs and DVDs)\n  Very good performance\nDisadvantages: Model is already 3 years old.  May be discontinued and designated \"vintage\" in a year or two.  Parts then unavailable.\n  4 gigs memory is standard (upgradeable to 8)\n\nNewer Model\nAdvantages:  Solid state storage (get the model with at least 256 gigs)\n  8 gigs memory standard\n  Latest generation processor\n  MUCH faster\n  Lighter weight\n  Slightly (in my opinion) display\nDisadvantages:  Costs several hundred more\n  Uses an optional external optical drive (which is relatively cheap)\nSummarizing, this computer has good performance and is low priced compared to other Apple Laptops (although high priced compared with Windows machines.  Unless you are a Fanboy who must have the very latest Apple product, you will be happy with this computer."}

Will offer this - if you're using Migration Assistant, don't select the include software option because if Yosemite isn't compatible with any one of your old programs you might encounter a 24 hour stall - and never know what the problem was. So after migrating your data and settings bring your apps over one at a time manually to make sure all is cool and stay under control of the situation. This MPB is the one - as me olde eyes can't appreciate Retina - and this is the last upgradable MBP - battery and RAM not glued in, Firewire, DVD drive - yep. As I came from a 2006 MacBook with a 7,200rpm drive this felt a little less responsive - but as OWC has 480GB flash drive for < 200 bucks I'll be visiting them. One other issue - - Safari stalled unmercifully. The fix was to delete a cache database In Finder, Go to Folder and put in ~/Library/Caches/com.apple. Safari/Cache.db then restart Safari and good to go. So that $2,640 Retina PB on  Store wasn't as useful to me as this one, upgraded, with tax and all for <$1,500. Good luck - and enjoy the very slick new trackpad if your old one was \"skiddy.\""}

Took over a minute to turn on (yes I timed it). That is ridiculous for an over $1000 laptop. Bought a lenovo y50 instead for a similar price (I think about $50 more, but it was also $700 off at the time so the original price was around $1800), and it has a better processor, way better graphics card, way better built in speakers, 4x more RAM, more ports (including regular HDMI), and a 500 GB SSD (which is very noticeably better than this laptop's). My new laptop is literally better in every non-subjective respect, most noticeably in startup time (about 1.5 minutes average for the Mac, about 5 seconds for the Lenovo) and in graphical capabilities (Mac cannot run even slightly graphical intensive programs, Lenovo can run most current, top of the line games at medium quality).\n\nI would never recommend this laptop, perhaps if I'd gone with a more expensive version I would have been happier, but I doubt Apple makes a laptop that compares well to my current laptop, and, if it does, it is way more than I paid for my Lenovo.\n\n/r/hailcorporate Lenovo edition"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I previously owned a 2014 MacBook Air that was sadly stolen from me. I was hesitant to go from something as light as the Air to this bulkier model, but after several days of use, despite the obvious disadvantage in size, this Pro beats my Air in my personal taste test, hands down.\n\nLet's be clear: this MacBook Pro is from mid-2012 and does not have the acclaimed Retina display that the newer ones come with. I actually had money for the Retina MacBook Pro and yet I still chose this model, and I'll explain why.\n\nFirst, it's very cost-effective compared to the entry-level Retina MacBook Pro. I got this one at Best Buy for $1044 and the entry-level Retina was $1299. Now that's not a bad price for the Retina model IF you actually need the specs it comes with (and are really in love with the display), but I decided in my case that my type of usage did not warrant it. I suspect the average user's usage would not warrant it, either. Further points:\n\n- The screen has been called \"archaic\" and even \"atrocious\" by some professional sites. I could not think of a quote I've read in years that was more exaggerated. Those who tell you the screen is anything approaching horrible are mostly just being elitist or seriously have an eye problem. No, this isn't the Retina, but the screen is still better than any other laptop I have ever owned, including my stolen Air. It still qualifies as HD and maybe it has something to do with the glossy finish, but colors are bright and beautiful and everything looks nice and smooth. I have actually had people tell me they can't use non-Retina screens anymore and try to convince me you can see the pixels on them. Funny, because I don't see any pixels. The screen is great, don't let some snob convince you otherwise.\n\n- The 2.5ghz processor and 4GB RAM is more than adequate for the average consumer's use. I have people tell me all the time that 4GB of RAM just \"isn't enough\" these days when all they do on a computer is surf the web, check emails, Facebook, and the news, blog, write documents for work/school, and watch Netflix. From my experience, this is what the majority of consumers need a computer for, and trust me, the specs on this model are more than enough for you to do all of that without hiccups. Unless you're editing high definition video, using Photoshop, or running 50 tabs on your browser in addition to having multiple programs open, you do not \"need\" more than 4GB. Currently, as I write this, I have my Firefox browser open with several tabs, iTunes running in the background, Messages open, Mail, and a chat program called Adium. I am experiencing no lags in performance, and could probably still open more programs and be fine. Point is, don't get suckered into going all out on your specs if you don't need to. Which leads me to my next point...\n\n- IF, in the future, you decide you need more memory, this MacBook Pro is the last model made that is user-upgradable. That means you can simply find out what sort of RAM you need, buy it (they're cheap), and follow online instructions on how to install it. This model is easily upgradable to 8GB SHOULD YOU NEED IT. It will cost you about $40-60 and about 15 minutes of your time.\n\n- If you REALLY need the better performance, you can also swap out the HDD drive for an SSD (Solid State Drive), which will improve overall speed and boot-up time. Again, this is the last MacBook Pro you can configure yourself, so changing the HDD is very doable with some time and knowledge from the Internet.\n\n- Despite being HDD (which is slower than the newer SSD drives), this computer still boots up and is ready to use in 1 minute. If you literally can't wait 1 minute for your computer to become useable, you should probably reconsider your time management skills.\n\n- As for the operating system, OSX has always been easy to use (once Windows users get the hang of it) and well integrated with everything from your iPad to iPhone (I can send and receive text messages sent to my iPhone from the Messages app on this computer), so nothing has changed there--if you've used OSX, it's still as good as ever. My unit shipped with OSX Yosemite on it and it works great.\n\n- The build quality is what MacBook Pros are really famous for, and if you have ever used a cheap, plastic PC, and have yet to behold the beauty of a MacBook, you're in for a treat--beautiful aluminum unibody, backlit keyboard, amazing trackpad, and responsive keys...Apple puts a lot into its design, and it shows. Yes, this is thicker than the newer Retina models, but the size and weight are not a deterrent unless you plan on walking several miles a day with this thing on your back, which in case you may want an Air to begin with and not a Pro at all. Personally, I like this MacBook's slightly thicker design better than the new, thinner Retina models because it looks more like a \"traditional\" laptop in terms of size.\n\n- This is the last MacBook Pro to come with an optical disc drive, which to ME was a plus. I realize CDs and DVDs are becoming increasingly outdated with the push to streaming and downloads, but as someone who has a vast collection of DVDs that are still perfectly good, it's nice to have the option to pop one in and watch it should I be on a road trip or in a hotel room. I also have about 200 CDs leftover from the 90s-2000s and it's nice to not have to buy them all on iTunes again--simply insert and rip to the hard drive, then sell or toss them out. Even if you don't need the optical drive, it's still nice to have just in case, as many older programs (including my Rosetta Stone discs) still use CDs for installation.\n\n- This is also the last MacBook Pro to have a built-in ethernet port. This comes in handy when I'm staying in hotels with poor wifi and I have the option to plug directly into the ethernet port on the work desk. It also gives me better Internet performance at home should my router be acting up. With a newer Pro, you need to purchase a separate adapter to get ethernet capability.\n\n- Heat-wise, I have not experienced any issues with this model becoming too hot. If I watch Netflix or stream a lot of video, it does get warm, but not so hot I can't touch the chassis. Installing a program like SMC Fan Control also gives you the ability to manually turn on and adjust the fan speed should you feel the chassis is getting too hot for you. I have it installed and have only had to use it once. When doing normal tasks and even ripping CDs, the chassis does not get hot for me. Typically long periods of streaming from Netflix will cause some heat, but that's about it.\n\n- Apple claims you get about six hours of battery life on this unit, but I have actually been getting eight. It charges fast, as well. When on 11% battery, I went to plug it in before taking a shower. My shower lasted about 20 minutes and when I got out, the computer was already at 50% charge. So by my estimation, it would only take about 45 minutes to go from a dead to a full battery. Impressive.\n\n- As far as Internet browsing goes, mine is lightning fast and I am getting over 50mbps download speed (though of course this depends on your service, but I'm just saying that it's not slow when browsing and should handle any speed you pay for).\n\nSo, to sum it all up, don't spend more money than you need to and go all out on a Retina model with specs you won't take advantage of when, for the average consumer, this MacBook Pro is cheaper and perfectly adequate for your needs. Save your money, and if you need to upgrade the specs in the future, know that you CAN do this with this model and make it as good as the base Retina one only by spending about $120. If you install 8GB of RAM and an SSD on your own, guess what? Minus the Retina display, your 2012 MacBook Pro has the same specs as the entry-level Retina! And even if it isn't decked out with the latest specs, it's still a MacBook Pro...this thing is going to last you YEARS if you take care of it. You also get the optical drive and, despite the naysayers, a beautiful screen to boot. I am completely satisfied with my purchase and will be enjoying this MacBook Pro for years to come...as will you."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "This is currently the last MacBook available with a physical hard disk, optical drive and FireWire. I still use FireWire for hooking up my old Sony Digital8 and HDV camcorders, as well as my 2nd gen Drobos. I needed the physical drive so I could upgrade the unit to much larger storage without paying so much for SSD. I didn't really \"need\" the built in DVD drive since I only burn discs a few times a year.\n\nNow that everything is said and done, I really think I would have been fine with a MacBook or Air. This laptop is big and heavy compared to how light and portable my iPad (or an Air) is these days. I could have used a Thunderbolt to Firewire adapter to access my old hardware, an external DVD burner for just the rare times I needed it, and since I ended up installing a SanDisk SSD in this MacBook anyway, I might as well have just done it with a smaller laptop. I suppose, ultimately, the only justification I really have for buying this unit was I wanted to max out the memory to 16GB and keep the faster processor for video editing.\n\nI think if you are not actually doing heavy lifting like video editing, and are not REGULARLY burning DVDs, the newer, lighter machines really are a better choice. I don't quite have buyer's remorse, but times have changed and now these traditional laptops (like the klunky PCs I use at work) just seem archaic compared to the nice, light designs of the Air and new MacBook.\n\nBut, this is still an incredibly nice laptop. Even three years old, it still is quite fast (especially with a replacement SSD and 16GB of RAM)."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I've been using computers since I was five years old, and started using Macs when I was 11. I grew up with Mac OS 7, 8, and 9, and moved on to Windows 98 in my teens when I discovered PC gaming. I haven't really used a Mac since. I've seen both sides of the pro and anti Mac arguments, I've seen heated Android/iPhone fights, and I've wrestled with adapting to personal use of technology even as I continue to support Enterprise use of technology for Fortune 500 companies.\n\nI've grown allergic to modern technology over the years, as spending 8 or more hours per day fixing tech products has a way of making you desperately want to get away from them. Strangely, despite my initial hatred of modern Apple designs (I grew up in the grassroots days of the 90's when Apple's products were beige), it was the iPod touch, iPad, and eventually the iPhone that changed my feelings towards technology in general in my personal life. Unlike others, who seem to love using technology to avoid friends and loved ones and build a hedge between themselves and the rest of the world, as I get older I want technology to do it's job and get out of my way. And that's what Apple products do, despite their steep learning curve and incredibly irritating design quirks (iTunes is a fearsome beast to try to master if you own thousands of mp3s you need to import).\n\nAnd that brings me to this machine, the first Mac I've ever extensively used since OS X came into existence.\n\nIt was initially purchased for my wife so that she could use it for her artwork and other needs, but as time went on she used it less and less, and I used it more and more for my writing, emails, and occasional day to day communications at home. For web surfing and casual gaming I use my iPad (a gift from my wife) so that I can watch shows with my wife in the evening without sitting at a desk with my back to her (again to get closer to people, not further away). I have an iPhone for checking email, making purchases, checking bank balances, and getting quick Internet info on the go (and yeah, making phone calls). And yeah, I have a gaming PC in the living room for watching TV shows and playing PC games. But for writing and business, I need something that's easy to use, reliable, with a long battery life and an easy to read screen (and a good keyboard). That's this machine. But it was NOT easy to get used to in any sense of the word.\n\nIf you grew up using Windows, switching to Mac OS X is jarring. You keep trying to find the Start Menu, and wondering how to get to the root of your machine. You keep wondering why the desktop folders look so ugly, and why you can't have multiple folders open at the same time. Safari is hard to get used to, installing third party apps is a nightmare, and the touchpad takes an enormous amount of getting used to. Apple makes it sound like you don't need a manual because you're going to just KNOW how to use everything on a Mac instantly, and this is simply not the case.\n\nThe glorious\n\nOnly very recently have I started to really love this machine. After years of casual use and steadily pushing myself and the machine I have learned to love it more and more as it and I finally start to get in sync. If you are going to for the Apple ecosystems you absolutely MUST sign up with iCloud. If you don't trust Apple with your info, forget the whole thing, you and Apple weren't made for each other. But if you sign up for iCloud and let it sync EVERYTHING you are going to start to understand at last what all this cloud nonsense is about. When you create contacts, notes, calendar items, etc in your iPad, iPhone, and Mac, they are shared everywhere. You can create text documents and Excel documents and open them and show them to others on another device incredibly easily. All the syncing is automatic and very fast. You can get a brand new iPhone and have it pull all of your contacts and info in mere seconds, automatically downloading all of your apps. Where this really shines is hand-off. You can be growing a website in one device and another will pick it up. My phone can ring and my MacBook will tell me. Awesome.\n\nAnd the funny thing about the Mac interface, is that while it is incredibly difficult to learn, it really is faster and more efficient in most cases. Once you start to FINALLY figure out all the swipes you can make on the incredibly solid and responsive trackpad, and you start to use them, you start to work faster and more efficiently. Web surfing and documents editing and viewing starts to become absolutely effortless. You start to wonder how you ever got by without being able to INSTANTLY zoom and move any documents using the trackpad. Now that I've gotten used to it, anything else feels backwards and last century.\n\nThe final word\n\nIn truth, a large part of the problem I had with this device when I first tried it was that I jumped onto if after someone else had configured it. The device needs to be setup by someone who has extensive technical knowledge. If it is not, you aren't going to have cloud backups of your data, you aren't going to have saved states that you can revert to in case of disaster, and the machine is going to get loaded up with crud that will slow it down. I recently completely wiped this machine because the bugs were multiplying to point where it was becoming unusable. It took all day to get it ready to use again, but in truth it was the easiest clean install I've ever performed. Hold down Command + R at startup. Select the Macintosh Hard Drive and erase it, format it, and install Mac OS X onto it. The latest version of Mac OS X will download and install. After installation completely you can copy back your info and start a fresh new clean system. Knowing what I know now, I setup the accounts the right way, and immediately synced my profile to my iCloud. I also immediately setup a backup device on an external hard drive that I dual formatted. Not the easiest thing the world for a newbie, but for an old IT like me, it's a dream compared to a Windows reinstall.\n\nThis machine is fast, responsive, quiet, beautiful, reliable, and the battery life is fantastic. If you like Macs, and just need a daily-use machine that's a bit more rugged, it's a great buy. If you want the latest and greatest go ahead and pay for it, but this machine is more than adequate for most, and runs Yosemite no problem. It also has a DVD drive. It's not retina display, but if you know anything about display technology you know that that's completely irrelevant unless you like visual placebos.\n\nIt was hard to learn for an old Windows user like me who grew up on the pre-Mac OS X machines, but I have grown to love this machine.\n\n*Update 4/28/15*\n\nAs a side note to anyone who wonders what the gaming capabilities of this machine are, I thought I would mention the following. On a lark I installed Steam onto this machine thinking I would just use for purchasing PC games during the Winter Sale which I watch out for every year. Much to my shock, of the 265 games installed on my gaming Windows machine, 167 are available for play on Mac OS.\n\nI installed a bunch of them, as some types of games are just better to play on a laptop than a projector in my opinion (card games, real-time strategy games). My thoughts on the laptop's GAMING capabilities?\n\nFor playing cutting edge games at ultra-high effects modes, you want a Windows machine. Playing Empire:Total War was certainly playable, but the draw distance and graphics effects looked like a computer from 2005. Turn-based strategy games like Shadowrun Returns (which actually ran much better than my PC) and card games like Fate of the World, on the other hand, look great, with very crisp, clean graphics. In short, if you decide to play games on this machine, you want 2D games only unless you don't mind VERY dated looking graphics in 3D. I have an iPhone 5C and an iPad Mini 2, and they both have better 3D graphics for gaming than this machine."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "My son LOVES it! The only places I could find that sold these are directly through Apple (which wanted WAY too much for their \"AppleCare warranty\"-it doesn't even cover drops,spills, etc...just a warranty to talk to to their technical support-what a joke), Best Buy (their \"Geek Squad\" warranty covers basically everything, including drops, spills, etc...but is approx. $350 for 2 yrs or $510 for 3 yrs and it's not like it's fixed right at the store- they still send it out, so you still have a wait time until you get it back), eBay (no warranties you can add-just a transferable warranty IF the person selling added it at time of purchase), and Amazon. Amazon, by far, beat the others in price AND you can add your own warranty for a very reasonable price ( I think I paid around $150 for 3 yrs) and it covers spills, drops, cracked screen, etc. I know this model is from 2012 and is not the newer one, but in my opinion is was a way better choice. I guess it just depends on what you're looking for & what is important to you. I didn't want the new MacBook Air because I was told by several sales associates at Best Buy that they have junky processors (compared to any of the MacBook Pro models, not in general), their storage/ memory options suck, and that any of the Pro models would be MUCH better for what my son would be using on it the most-Photoshop. I was told the Air models are best for people that needed easy portability, like traveling on business trips & needing to check emails & such. The new Pro models are very nice, but they have less storage & you end up paying so much extra for the retina display. If having retina display is super important to you, then go with the new models. It wasn't to me. Plus, this MacBook Pro, in my opinion, has GREAT image quality....if you put it beside one with retina, then yes-you WILL see an obvious difference between them....but, for me, the difference wasn't worth the difference in price, especially beings that the image quality on this model, while not as nice as the retina, still is amazing and far better than the quality of any other laptop I compared it to of similar price. Also, a HUGE selling feature for me is that this one comes with the DVD SuperDrive built into it, which none of the newer MacBook AIrs or Pros do....for the newer models, you can buy a SuperDrive (they were $80 at Best Buy), but you connect them with a USB cable and then you're stuck with a laptop, SuperDrive, and a wire attaching them and that's not very ideal if your traveling & want your kid to be able to watch a DVD. Also, with this model, you can upgrade the 500 GB to a higher one, if you need to. That's always a nice option, which again, the newer models do not come with and are not capable of. Do your research & pick what's best for your personal needs. This model, while SLIGHTLY heavier than the new ones, is still very lightweight (and remember-this one has the SuperDrive built into it, so that compensates for the little bit of extra weight, which is only like 1lb.). I'm so happy with this MacBook Pro....and thrilled with the additional warranty options....and, most important of all, my 13 yr. old son LOVES it...he got it for Christmas and definitely wasn't expecting it and the pure look of shock and happiness on his face when he opened it was absolutely PRICELESS. (He wanted & asked for a laptop and, even though he has an iPhone, an iPod touch, and a iPad with retina, he didn't bother asking for a MacBook because, as he said, \"I would love a MacBook, but I know they're basically the most expensive laptops out there, so it doesn't matter-I'm fine with a any laptop-it doesn't have to be super expensive\". Through my research, I was told over & over again that Apple products are pricier because the quality & durability far exceeds any other brand, which is why they can charge more. So I made the decision to get him a MacBook...plus he can, and has, synced it to all his other Apple devices, so all his songs and apps are all there w/o the need to spend additional money. Boy-was he surprised!) He spends hours every day making \"edits\" (sports pics) with PhotoShop (which is now sold by subscription, which I also bought on Amazon-it arrives & looks like a gift card, which is super nice if you're giving it as a gift). Really, truly, honestly a great buy and a great product."}

Considering that I grew up with PC and Microsoft, I was skeptical but what really had my panties in a bunch was the price of one of these bad boys. Costing around $2300, one of these machines cost about a third of my current student loan debt (Yay!). If you're like me and are looking for the same quality machine but at a lower price, this version from about three years ago is still relevant and running great. I got mine used for around $800 six months ago and I have no regrets. With that being said, please do your research first (lots of it) before buying this or any other machine online from a third party. Good luck!"}

I switched to this after years of using Windows, and switching  has been more than a little frustrating.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "My wife's MacBook was growing long hair (it was a 2006 model) and it was time for an upgrade. Thank goodness for Amazon, where you can buy a used machine and expect to get what you pay for.\n\nThis Mac is only a couple of years old and has 2.5gigHz Core 2 Duo processor and can hold 8gig of RAM, which this one had when I received it. In addition, the supplier included a terabyte hard drive, which I like a lot but will be using as a backup drive. I replaced the hard drive with a 250gig SSD, making this machine blindingly fast. It has the Intel 4000 graphics card which will take care of anyone but extreme hard core gamers, and with the SSD might even take care of them.\n\nWhat can I say? The operating system was already at Yosemite, and if you get one that isn't, Apple generously gives you the update for free. There are no Mac viruses, virtually no malware, the software is easy to use, and constantly updating antivirus/malware software is not required. The laptop is manufactured using an impressive solid aluminum case. Access to memory and hard drive is ridiculously easy. The 13\" screen is just right for laptops and the computer fits nicely into your backpack or briefcase. Learning to use a Mac from being a PC enthusiast is as easy as pie as a neighbor of mine, 71 years old, will attest. I used the Migration Assistant to move all personal files from my wife's old MacBook and had no trouble at all getting everything transferred. The Migration Assistant took care of incompatibilities, so it wasn't necessary to plow through reams of software, checking what will work and what won't one item at a time as I have had to do in some PC upgrades. One surprise was the successful migration of Microsoft Office 8, which moved smoothly without a hitch and didn't require me to call Microsoft and ask for a new product code before it would work on the new machine. Huh. Something new from Redmond, I suppose. I have also performed document migration from an old PC to an iMac, and never cease to be amazed at how easy Apple has made it to move to one of their machines.\n\nI am 100% thrilled with this (new to me) computer, and expect it to continue working well for many years! Thumbs up!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "This review is specifically for the\n13.3\" (mid-2012)\n2.5 ghz i5\n4GB of RAM, model.\n\nI can describe this model as a well balanced machine of video, CPU, DVD/CD and mobile capabilities at a decent Apple price. It's more capable than an Air but not as pricey as a Retina model. It's a good starter laptop for Art/design students or anyone else switching from a Windows machine who may also want a disc drive on-hand.\n\nOpening the box and setting it up for the first time takes in incredibly short amount of time. In my case, the machine had Mavericks installed but a few clicks got me running Yosemite in roughly 30 minutes after downloading, installation and including other application updates. I appreciate the aluminum build as it prevents bending and feels solid no matter how you hold it. My previous laptops made from plastic always felt flimsy and creaked when opening and moving them.\n\nperformance is very good. the 2.5gHz i5 is swift and handles even the most demanding applications. Running Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign are no problem. When it comes to games i'd say the machine is about average at best when using the built-in display at the maximum resolution of 1280 X 800. I can run TF2 with medium-high settings. Running up to date games that are more graphically demanding such as Tomb Raider or Bioshock Infinite are playable at medium or lower settings. I haven't tested with an external monitor yet but I can assume performance will noticeably drop once higher resolutions are used. Again, the 1GB of video memory still does well for design applications and video playback.\n\nThe pre-installed 4GB of RAM perform fine but i'd say an expansion to 6, 8 or even more if supported would be best if you multitask with many applications. Battery life is advertised around 7 hours which can be done if wireless and other energy using features are turned off. A realistic time is around 3.5 hours and thats with Wifi, keyboard illumination on and average use of apps.\n\nConclusion:\nI've been wanting an Apple laptop for nearly a decade. This christmas season came and I finally was able to accomplish that goal. After switching from my Windows machine, I'm very satisfied and happy to use my Pro. It's made me happy even to do work-related tasks now. What i really appreciate is the ability to dual-boot Windows if needed. There are still too many apps on Windows for me to abandon that OS so having that option on the same machine has only made the experience even better.\n\nOne word of caution: The AC adapter; while it's design is very sleek and small compared to other adapters, the cord is notorious for breaking very quickly and easily. this hasn't happened to me yet but if you plan to own any Apple laptop, take extra care of the adapters cords. In the meantime please send emails to Tim Cook and pressure Apple to change and strengthen their cord designs!"}

I wanted something that didn't overheat on my lap and allowed me to easily upgrade the storage and ram. This model was the best option. In the future I can upgrade to an SSD when prices drop and I can upgrade the RAM if needed. In the future Apple might have options to do the same to their retina models, but for now this is the best option without blowing your budget to get a lot of storage. You compromise some on performance, but I didn't get this to run intensive applications. I also bootcamp so I lose storage space in half which is why I wanted more storage that the air can't provide."}

Each webpage online zips up in a second! I also really appreciate the DVD/CD capability since most computers today don't have one. The screen quality is more than clear. At the App store I was blown away to be honest. I thought it was going to be as bad as Windows but it was way better. They have a pretty wide selection of games to play. My ultimate favorite Sims 2 game was found on there.\n\nThe only thing that I could say is con is it isn't a light computer.

Mainly the hard drive, ram and display. The 5400rpm hard drive is slow to read and write and my 4 gigs of ram are easily maxed out on light usage, negatively impacting performance. 13 inch 720p displays are lackluster in 2014, but it gets nice and bright at least. The i5 and Intel HD graphics still perform nicely. Build quality is no issue, this laptop is what you'd expect. This is my first MacBook and what I find myself liking the most is the OS. As I find my interest in Windows waning I have really like the change to OSX, it can be for hardcore business or for casual computing all day. It's really smooth and makes good use of gestures with the trackpad. Battery life is great for a laptop.\nOverall this is one pretty decent laptop, but I don't think it's worth anywhere near 1,000$. The value I would personally place on this laptop is 800 AT MOST... and at that rate I found an ultrabook that blew this thing's specs right out of the water, and I personally would have rather had the ultrabook. If you can pick one of these up for less than 800 it's pretty well worth it, but I think it would be foolish to spend more on an aging laptop such as this one."}

The only issue I had was with the harddrive. The harddrive crashed and I thought I had lost the whole computer. Luckily that was not the case. Replacing the harddrive in this laptop is extremely easy, a couple screws on the back to remove the backplate and the harddrive is pretty much plug and play. I purchased a seagate solid state harddrive, the same kind that apple installs originally. And apple was happy to install the latest osx for free! You won't be disappointed with this computer!"}

The aluminum body is sleek and thin, but it does tend to scratch easily, so I got a plastic hard cover in order to  preserve it.  The operating system runs very smoothly and quickly even when uploading large photo and video files (which is my main function for this computer).  It also comes with the Apple versions of the Microsoft office programs.  They are much more intuitive than their rivals, but still compatible for emailing, etc. if you are working with someone that does not have a Mac, you can still use/share these files.  The backlit keyboard is very nice and makes it easy to type in darker places. Overall, I LOVE this Mac and definitely think it's worth the money!"}

Its a BEAUTIFUL computer and is super fast (depending on what you need it to do) It plays Netflix and Youtube in HD easily and plays Minecraft nicely. The display is BEAUTIFUL and it's not even the Retina. The speakers are actually good for a laptop (it has a left, right, and a subwoofer). The operating system is so much nicer then windows is. It takes a little bit getting use to it but its really easy to use. This is by far my favorite computer I've owned. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a good laptop, but if you wanna do hardcore gaming then you should get the 15 inch. The 13 inch is perfect for everyday web surfing, video, and light gaming."}

Let me tell you i don't watch televison and ive been in bed for 3-4 years and its all use, constant netflix and youtube all day and everyday 7 days a week 8 hours a day plugged in.  Ive been through one battery from all the use and wear and tear from constant streaming of video content.  This thing is a beast like a timex watch never stops and smooth as can be.  Fast and highly functional and programable and customizable.  You can program each finger for a gesture that is the main reson i bought one for the gestures and control you get by using all of your fingers to flip through tabs and close screens.  I use MAC PREFERENCES and JITOUCH  download these two programs and you will have the best gesture control from your mac and the awesome trackpad.  Apple makes the best laptop money can buy and the software is out of this world production quality with apple software is possible.  Everyone should have a mac.  Buy one you will be  be sorry if you dont.  Its a little expensive but its so worth it you won't need to get another one for years and years.  Just get the biggest had space you can get and buy apple care if its your first mac or search online there are so many mac owners out there that you can get answers to alot of things but apple care i recoomend its also a little pricey after paying for the laptop but you have almost a year to add it for an additional two more years or three years in total so with that kind of support and hardware quality and supreme software its a wise choice to buy a mac you will save money in the long run and you can keep it because they last."}

Even Apple-made applications take forever to launch (I keep track and sometimes more that a minutes just to open the window).\n\nI've been in contact with the Apple customer support team for the last 3 months or so. We've conducted a long number of tests, restarted the entire system twice, and I even took it to the Apple Store and left there for them to work on it.\n\nThe laptop works better... but I cannot rely on it; I have to be careful on how many applications I open an things like that.\nNow that the warranty expired, I'm having the hardest time to reach the customer support.

About the speed, its fast as a high end PC for everything EXCEPT intense games. It can play low-med end games perfectly. It plays borderlands 2 on maximum settings smooth like butter, but don't push it because the cooling on this computer is average, and can't handle intense games.

Portable, not too heavy, and at a reasonable price point.\n\nThe real bonus for this model is that you can configure it further AFTER purchase. Don't bother spending more on memory or disk from the factory, do it afterward.\n\nThe first thing I did was upgrade the RAM to 16GB. Easily done, and a lot cheaper than what Apple charges.\n\nThe second thing I did was add a 256GB SSD, and move the 500GB disk to a caddy, taking out the optical drive.\n\nThat configuration lasted me for around a year or so, and then the price of SSDs dropped further, so I replaced the DVD drive and moved all storage to a 960GB SSD.\n\nHad I purchased a Retina version I wouldn't have had all of these options. Sure, I would have saved a pound or so of weight, but with soldered RAM and a non-standard SSD I couldn't have upgraded all of this myself.\n\nHighly recommended."}

It replaced an old desktop unit and a clunky 17\" laptop which I owned for a year.\nMy ultimate decision to go Apple was based on my general satisfaction with the other Apple products I own. I am currently in grad school and am pursuing an advanced degree in Information Technology. I also run a small business. While I don't require a monster workhorse, this MacBook is more than adequate for my needs. I also use this to watch movies and listen to music. It is used occasionally for gaming.\nWhile I have more than adequate space for the many apps that I have installed on it, I am impressed by its zippy processing speed. It's fast and never seems to slow down. For a relatively small screen, the screen is bright and produces a clear and crisp image. The keyboard is comfortable to use.\nWhile it isn't as light as my MacBook Air (which I use on the road), it is light and compact enough to travel with. Trust me on this one since it just went on the road with me. The battery life is about 9 hours between charges if this is used strictly for school or work. However, it is more in the 5-6 hour range if I am watching movies,etc.\nI personally have not run into any issues with this MacBook. However, I am comfortable enough with Apple products that most issues can be resolved via Apple Support or innumerable sites or chat lists. Overall, Apple products are intuitive and I have been able to solve problems on my other 'i' products with ease and I am no techie.\nSo far, the only accessories that I have bought to combo up with this MacBook is an Apple SuperDrive, a mouse which is only used occassionally since the touchpad is very comfortable, and a hard shell protective case.\nWhile I love this netbook, clearly this may be inadequate for some people. My son needs a monster Mac and this wouldn't work for him. My advice if you have any misgivings about what to buy, visit an Apple store and you can usually be steered toward the right PC regardless of where you choose to buy it.\nI love this Pro. It is cool looking, pretty light and convenient, and very fast and dependable."}

This makes the hard drive unreadable and you can't use the laptop. This was of course covered under warranty but regardless this should not have happened to a laptop that is $1000+. I am a student in medical school and unfortunately this occurred just days before a huge test. Two days were wasted in getting this fixed. I will admit that apple care was very helpful.\n\nJust a month after my warranty ran out, the same problem occurred and just to my luck it happened the week of a very important exam. My hard drive bracket broke again. I took it to apple and they said that it wasn't the bracket and flashed my computer so I conveniently lost all my data. I took the computer home, turned it on and the computer gave me the same error. I had to drive all the way back the store and demand the fix it. They concluded it was the hard drive bracket. They proceeded to take my computer to fix it. Even though they wasted two hours in the flashing process and incorrectly diagnosing my computer problem, they went on to charge my $57 to get it fixed since I did not have my warranty anymore. Again, two days were wasted in this problem that occurred a second time.\n\nNow this is the best part, four months after the repair the problem came back during test week (of course). Conveniently it was four months so it was out of the 90 day parts and labor warranty associated with the second repair. This is the third time the SAME problem occurred on my laptop. They did not look into this reoccurring problem, just repaired it and wasted two days of studying time again. I asked apple to completely replace the laptop all together but they will not because the price of repair is \"Only $57 to repair\". This money adds up and I am sure the problem will come back. Can't do anything but use the laptop and wait four months for it to break again.\n\nI would not recommend a apple product to anyone I know. I was actually thinking about getting a mac for my mother since they are so easy to use but with all these problems happening to a $1000+ laptop I would not want my mom to suffer. How can a laptop that costs so much be so fragile and have the same problem three times. My parents have used windows laptops three times longer than I have owned this laptop with no need for any repairs. Maybe I just have a faulty mac, but Apple should take charge of this and replace it. This is an investment I made for college that has given me nothing in return but pain in my ass. I would not recommend this product to anyone. For this price you can find a very solid Microsoft laptop that will not break within three months of buying it."}

The person taken the call was very rude and he said he could try but really there nothing he could do. I requested to talk to supervisor and this person was even worse. In short, if you have any problem with this product good luck dealing with Data Vision.  I would not order again from them. They claim in the phone message that they are one of the largest companies. It may be true I do not know, but most certainly they have a terrible customer service.  If they cannot fix a very minor problem for the delivery, what can they fix?"}

I've had it for 5 years, and this one replaced the one I had for over 5 years prior. I had gotten tired of always getting anti-viruses, slow speeds when I had multiple tabs open, and always trying to defragment or clean it up because it performed poorly. I've been itching for a MacBook for years, and when I got the amazon card with no interest for a year, I grabbed it. So far, I've had it for almost a month, and I love it. I really haven't used it to it's full potential yet, but I enjoy how not only is it VERY light, but I can use it for an entire day without charging it, unlike my laptop as it got older. (Near the end I couldn't have it unplugged for longer than an hour, so imagine if I wanted to move from room to room.) I hope to have an update in a few months to see how far I've come, but I have no complaints so far."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "UPDATE: February 13, 2017 -- I first wrote the review below on May 6, 2014, a little less than 6 months after I got the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/MacBook-Pro/dp/B0074703CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">MacBook Pro</a>&nbsp;the previous Christmas (Christmas 2013) and its still working pretty great. However although I still LOVE my MacBook Pro, despite the \"star rating\" saying \"like\" (because unfortunately this site does not allow users to rate items in increments [like giving or taking away 1/2 star or 1/4 star or whatever) I just recently discovered, the HARD WAY that this MacBook Pro does NOT have an \"audio input\" which means that this laptop either can NOT be used (or can, only in a way I've yet to find!) to transfer or convert analog audio files from record players, cassette tape decks to digital for use on iPods and other mp3 players or to burn to CD -- at least maybe NOT unless the user also has a USB record player and/or USB cassette tape deck, which I do NOT have!\n\nI'm pretty disappointed that this MacBook Pro lacks an audio input and that Apple (and/or Best Buy) neglected to mention that in the specs. I know its my fault for not researching better. But the listing did not (and as far as I know, still does not) say anywhere that it lacks an audio input, and I just automatically assumed (I know, I know, like the saying goes, \"When you assume, you make an a$$ out of U [you] and me!\") that it would be a standard feature, especially since this laptop also has a SuperDrive CD/DVD burner.  Unfortunately it does NOT have an audio input and I did not know that when I got it, and now kind of wish I did. As such, I am mentioning it here, so that hopefully, nobody else unknowingly makes the same mistake. Because although it probably would not have changed my wanting/getting a MacBook Pro, by the same token, instead of getting this model from Best Buy (during a Black Friday sale) I'd probably have looked elsewhere, like maybe the Apple Store, or Amazon, or even eBay for a model that DOES have an audio input.\n\nInstead, now I'm scrambling to try to find the cheapest/cheaper & most cost-effective way of transferring/converting the dozens of vinyl records (at least 1 of which is not available on ANY other format -- not CD, not iTunes, not Spotify, NOTHING) and countless cassette tapes before they deteriorate and are unusable.\n\nWhich is one reason why I'm dropping my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars. Personally, I'd prefer to have taken off just a half star instead of a full star for the lack of audio input. But since Amazon does not allow fractional star ratings, and I no longer think that this MacBook Pro deserves a full 5 stars (and I can't give it 4 1/2 stars) I took off one star, for their choice to take away a very essential feature of computers.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI got this&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Apple-MacBook-Pro-13-3-Inch-Laptop/dp/B0074703CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Apple MacBook Pro 13.3-Inch Laptop</a>&nbsp;as a Christmas gift (though it was actually bought from Best Buy during the \"Black Friday\" sales) from my family this past holiday season (Christmas 2013) and even though I've only had it for a little over four months, so far I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY LOVE my MacBook Pro!!!\n\nAlthough this is the FIRST Mac computer I've ever owned (though its not the first Apple product I've had -- I got an iPad Mini a little over a year ago). I have been wanting to switch from PCs to Mac/Apple for a LONG, LONG time because I HATE Bill Gates (but that's a separate issue!) with a PASSION and I absolutely despise Microsoft and Windows-based computers. Until I got this MacBook Pro, ALL the computers I've had were PCs going all the way back to Windows 3.1 in the early 90's.\n\nBut, no matter what kind of PC computer I've had (whether laptops, desktops or netbooks) and regardless of the brand (whether HP, Acer, Toshiba, Dell, Gateway, or some generic brand), and no matter what Windows operating system it used (whether Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows NT, Windows XP or Windows Vista), I had nothing but problems with those computers from day one. There would always be constant screen freezing, computer crashes, incredible slowness, viruses, spyware/malware/adware (despite anti-virus protection and anti-spyware/malware/adware software) and other hassles, while, most, if not every Apple user I spoke to said how much easier and user-friendly that Mac was -- and my own experiences using Apple/Macintosh computers all through school from elementary school through high school, was further confirmation.\n\nHowever, although I'd been wanting to switch to Mac for the past several years, I hesitated because of the price. I couldn't/can't really afford it on my own, and although I mentioned to my family how much I wanted to switch from PC to Mac, I didn't want to ask them (since they usually give major electronic items like computers as their main Christmas gift) to spend $1,200+ for a MacBook instead of the $500 -$600 max that they'd otherwise spend on a PC computer bought at Black Friday \"door-buster\" sales. So for at least 3-4 years I kept using the same crappy Windows laptop, while looking long and hard and comparing different Macintosh models and dreaming of someday being able to switch -- which finally happened this past Black Friday, when Best Buy had a sale for the 13 inch MacBook Pro for under $1,000 (okay it was $999, but still under $1,000!) which my family got me for Christmas. I am so glad they did, because I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my MacBook Pro!\n\nI am also VERY glad that my family got me THIS model, and NOT the version with the Retina screen, because the non-Retina MacBook Pro is the ONLY Apple/Mac product available now that still comes with an internal optical drive (although internal disc drives are not really a necessity with desktop models [like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mac-Mini/dp/B007476KRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mac Mini</a>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/iMac/dp/B004YLCJXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">iMac</a>&nbsp;computers] that remain stationary and do not need to be carried around everywhere).\n\nPersonally, I would MUCH rather have THIS MacBook Pro, and  I think its RIDICULOUS that the Retina version does not include an internal optical drive! Having no internal Blu-Ray in ANY of its products is bad enough but, especially, given the price-tag for MacBooks, lacking even a basic CD/DVD drive is ridiculous. Just because the greedy concept of \"planned obsolecence\" deems it necessary, does NOT mean that some of us are going to suddenly stop using and abandon/dispose of our dozens (if not hundreds!) of DVDs, CDs, cassette tapes and vinyl records, and just jump up to blindly embrace a disc-less and virtual future!\n\nI mean, although I only have probably about a half dozen or so Blu-Rays, I have HUNDREDS of CDs & DVDs (I lost count somewhere around 100, and wasn't 1/4 or even 1/8 of the way through the collection!) including both commercially-produced CDs & DVDs of music, movies & TV shows, as well as home-burned CDs and DVDs. I also have a few dozen vinyl records, and what seems like several hundred VHS videotapes, and audio-cassettes (either commercially-produced or purchased as blanks & painstakingly recorded personally) bought & collected, nearly all of which I still watch or listen to at one time or another.\n\nMany of us are not able to just jump like a jackrabbit from one latest technological craze to the next, from vinyl records and 8-tracks, to cassette tapes, to CDs and now to mp3s & iTunes, and from Betamax to VHS, to laser-discs to DVDs, to HD-DVDs, to Blu-Rays, and now to online video streaming. More importantly, not all of us are willing (or able to afford!) to suddenly replace our collections of music, movies and TV shows, recorded in a certain format, just because the technology has arbitrarily changed, often necessitating the re-purchase of that media in the new format.\n\nWhich is why, even though I now DO have an mp3 player (which just got recently in the past year or two), an&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Apple-TV/dp/B007I5JT4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Apple TV</a>&nbsp;(which I got from my brother this past Christmas) and a Sony television set with online streaming, I also still have & use not only a DVD player/recorder, but also a VCR, a 200 disc CD changer, a stereo with AM/FM radio & dual-cassette tape deck, and even a record player (a NEW&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sony-PS-LX250H-Automatic-Belt-Drive-Turntable/dp/B00005T3XH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sony PS-LX250H Automatic Belt-Drive Turntable</a>&nbsp;that I got a year or so ago) for vinyl LPs. Because its all videos or music which I enjoy watching or listening to, but yet, for the most part, I still don't like enough to waste money paying yet again to download it from iTunes (or other online streaming).\n\nAlthough it would probably be cheaper overall to just convert the music and videos to digital format on my own, it would probably take a lifetime to transfer everything -- and I'm not going to spend money to buy equipment to convert them to a format (like mp3) especially when, in a few years, it will likely just be deemed obsolete anyway!\n\nWhich is one (of the many) reasons why I  my MacBook Pro!\n\nI LOVE that it includes an internal CD/DVD drive (and best of all, UNLIKE all my previous PC laptops, its NOT a bulky CD/DVD drawer, but rather just a sleek thin slot on one edge of the laptop). I'm almost always using my computer's CD/DVD drive to see movie or TV show DVDs or listen to CDs, and in my opinion having to carry additional components, like an external DVD drive totally defeats the purpose of even having a laptop (being a virtual replacement/equivalent to a desktop computer and yet also being portable enough to use it just holding it in one's hands while mobile!).\n\nFurthermore, its not like there's nothing available for those who want portable computing devices without optical drives. There ARE already more than enough options for them. They're called netbooks, iPads, iPad Minis, tablets, some kinds of Kindles, MacBook Airs, and even to a lesser degree, iPhones, smartphones and iPods -- and its one thing to make those without any disc drives because they are SUPPOSED to be ultra-portable, and CD/DVD drives would take up too much space & weight to keep them small and lightweight. But regular laptops are different, and what's the point of even having a laptop if a user is going to be bogged down having to lug around a bunch of other external peripherals like CD/DVD or Blu-Ray drives (as well as discs they want to play)  external hard drives & USB \"thumb\" jump storage drives, along with the requisite power cords/battery chargers................they may as well get a stationary desktop computer! UGH!!!! :\\\n\nIn any case, the now-rare (since Apple have discontinued the internal optical drives in the 15 inch & 17 inch MacBooks and are planning to phase them out in the 13 inch ones) internal CD/DVD drive, is just one of the MANY things that I LOVE about my&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Apple-13-3-Inch-MacBook-Pro/dp/B0074703CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Apple 13.3-Inch MacBook Pro</a>. Even with only 4GB of RAM memory (though I'm considering buying a 16 GB of RAM memory \"upgrade\" in the near future) this MacBook is LIGHTNING-FAST compared to any of the Windows computers I've ever had. Not only is it much faster, but Mac is far easier to use. For example, with every single one of the crappy Windows computers I've ever had, the screen/system would be freezing AT LEAST once or twice a day, if not more -- whereas in just the 4 or so months since Christmas that I've had this MacBook, I've only had like 1 incident of minor (far easier to handle than when the Windows PCs would freeze!) screen freezing, and even that was only when I was installing/updating some software so, in my opinion, the freezing was understandable -- and when I called Tech Support, Apple handled it so efficiently, that as soon as I spoke to them and did what they suggested, the computer was immediately unfrozen and I've had NO more problems since (though I don't even consider that particular incident a \"problem\")\n\nI LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my MacBook Pro! The differences between this laptop and ANY & ALL of the Windows-based PCs I've had for the past 20+ years, is literally like NIGHT & DAY!\n\nNot only are Apple products much sleeker, and elegant-looking, but after experiencing first-hand how much faster and easier Mac OS is compared to Windows, I will NEVER, EVER buy a Windows-based PC or device again if I can help it! If only Bill Gates would spend more time trying to fix his bug-ridden, virus-plagued crap Windows PCs, and less time getting in bed with Monsanto & Merck and trying to pollute the planet and destroy mankind..........maybe then he'd be able to manufacture a quality product that, like Apple, is not vulnerable to every single virus and bug! There's a saying I heard from Apple users who said, \"Once you go Mac, you never go back!\", and its so true! After seeing how much better it is, I'm sticking with Mac and as long as I have any say it it, I'm NEVER, EVER, EVER going back to Windows!!\n\nApple and Mac, ALL THE WAY, baby!!!!"}

She makes videos for some classes and said Macs are best for this.  She also told me she needed FCP X.  So, I paid out $1500.\n\nPower cord failure after 6 months. Common complaint, Google it.\n\nAbout 9 months after purchase the glass monitor cracks.  Of course I thought my daughter had dropped it, but a witness--her grandmother-- said it made a \"pop\" sound while sitting on the table, and just cracked.  We had to replace that on our dime. Common complaint; Google it.\n\nOne year after purchase my daughter goes abroad to study.  Shortly thereafter her MBP starts to act up, but can she find anyone to service this computer, on the island where she is living? Of course not. (Note:  the University she is attending is still using FCP 7 and ancient Mac systems; exchange students beware). So I have to FedEx her trusty old Samsung netbook from way back, the same $269 netbook that she took to the Amazon jungle eons ago, to get her through the rest of the semester.\n\nDaughter returns home midyear, we pay for logic board repairs, and off daughter goes again, this time to study in Turkey. Within 2 months of arriving in Istanbul, her MBP is showing the gray screen with the ? and all you Apple users know what THAT means. We tell her, take it to the Apple store.  She says, what Apple store? There is NO Apple store in Turkey! So she takes it to an \"Apple authorized service center\" but they won't work on it, they say it might be a hardware problem, and besides, Apple is opening a store soon, take it to their Genius Bar.\n\nSo in the meantime I am once again Fedexing yes, you guessed it, the trusty, banged up, dented, scratched 5 yr old Samsung netbook to Istanbul.  While the $1500 MBP w/FCP sits, a cool, cold, and beautiful reminder of a bad relationship, awaiting it's fateful appointment (3 weeks away) with the Genius who will nicely inform my daughter that she will have to pay several hundred dollars if she wants her MBP working again.\n\nAnd surprise! Now my daughter discovers that none of her peers are using FCP X because it is too costly, too restrictive, too difficult to learn, and they are going back to PCs and using  Avid and Adobe!\n\nIn a few months my daughter has an assignment to North Africa. She is taking the old Samsung netbook with her, and leaving the Macbook Pro (as she says, selling for parts) behind in Istanbul.\n\nIf you are the type of urbanite who has access to an Apple store and/or can call Apple care toll free, maybe a MBP is for you.  But if you are an international road warrior, God help you, because Apple won't."}

Many times it won't connect to Wifi. Or it will tell me that it is connected but when I go to Safari or mail it says I am not connected to the internet. I also think its ridiculous that at its price, it does not come with Windows for MAC. You have to buy it separately and it cost around $150. So I can't do Excel spreadsheets, word, etc. and I refuse to spend the additional money on the download. It crashed not long ago and I had to reinstall everything. So I ended up buying a Microsoft Surface 2 tablet with a detachable keyboard and I love it. I only use the MAC if I absolutely have to. Its unfortunate that I don't like the MAC since I have an iPhone 4S and I love that!"}

That is basically the pcu running the graphics (cheaper alternative).\n-Computer is just not worth the price (its just hyped up). You could get a better computer that runs on i7 and has 8gb of ram 1.5TB with SSD cards and a nice graphics card for that price.\n\nOverall I would not recommend this computer. I like the way it looks but the internal system is just not for me. Its more for students, artists, and people who like everything preset for them. I also dislike the fact that they constantly nag you to update to their new software."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "Can you buy a cheaper laptop that is just as fast...yes.  Can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a MacBook?  No you cannot. There are many PC laptops that have copied the MacBook design but not one of them comes close at surpassing it.  This is a laptop with almost no fault. Awesome design, great screen, great speakers, blazing SSD, and build quality only Apple seems to pull off at such a small size.\n\nYou can shop around and find a lot of laptops that have better this and better that, but where Apple excels is making everything great and not skimping on anything. That is why I love this thing.\n\nPros:\nAwesome Screen\nGood Speakers\nBoots in 14 seconds\nVery Fast\nBest Trackpad design, no one even comes close here.\nGreat Keyboard\nThunderbolt\n\nCons:\nIf at certain angles edges can be a little sharp.\nNo DVD drive (does not bother me, but some might find it annoying)\nKeyboard lacks numpad (not a big deal to me, but if you work a lot with numbers it's something to think about)\nOnly two USB ports (If you plan on plugging a lot of crap into your MBP then you might want to invest in a hub)\n\nSo while the MBP is not perfect, it comes closer to it then any other laptop out there. The 13' model is a sweet spot for price in my opinion. It's a very good deal and the resale value once you upgrade in 3-5 years will shock you."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "Indeed, this has extraordinary graphics and speed. I own an iPhone, iPad and Apple TV, and long ago my first computer was an Apple II+ and I loved using the old Macintoshes in the 80s. So, I'm partial to Apple. Their products, including the MBP, are beautiful, sleek and clever. I haven't had an Apple computer in a long time.\n\nHowever, other than its graphics capability, this Apple computer and apparently its brethren are not ready for real work in the professional world. Apple remains a novelty item mostly living on its own island, preferring to interact with its own tribe on its own terms. I spent $5,000 on the best version of this machine available and peripherals, so I could switch from a PC. After two months of trying to make it do the things my PC laptop did, I'm about to ditch it all and buy another PC. I don't do this lightly. I've put many hours in to trying to make this work.\n\nAmong the reasons:\n1. My printer won't work with this so I bought a new printer.\n2. My scanner won't work with this so I spent $150 for special software inferior to the original.\n3. My professional software doesn't work on Apple so I run those programs through Parallels. That makes them so very slow, more complicated, and less usable.\n4. The Word processing program is a more limited accommodation of the Apple system. Same for Excel, etc.\n5. The mail program is inadequate for managing a lot of email from multiple sources.\n6. The keyboard is awful and makes it a chore to navigate around a document. People who do a lot of work fast need to move around a document. We need buttons for going to the beginning and end of a document, page up and page down, and so forth. On an Apple these and other functions are either missing, hard to use, or you have to use multiple keystrokes to do them as a work-around.\n7. The Apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key. Again, you have to do a work-around to delete, rather than just push a button.\n8. Also, the engineers at Apple don't think people use faxes anymore. Please note Apple: The world still uses faxes and you don't. It took me extra time and money to buy an external modem that would work with a Macbook, and to set it up specially with this OS. Then I learned that I can't fax out of the Mac using my professional cover page. Their cover page is nothing more than a few words on a blank piece of paper and of course looks like it was done by a 10-year-old. Again, Apple is not ready for the professional world, it's a novelty. My PC does this very easily and it looks good. I had to work around this through Windows run through Parallels. Therefore, I also had to install another version of Word through Parallels to handle the documents to be faxed. More work-arounds that are clunky, slow, and bothersome.\n\nPeripherals are very pretty, and not very functional.\n1. The Thunderbolt display is magnificently beautiful but rigidly low in functioning. It doesn't turn, bend, or look up and down. You do it their way or not at all. And it only talks with certain macs and never, ever anything else. You fit to the display, it doesn't try to fit to your needs. My Dell display fits what I need physically and electronically.\n2. The external keyboard I bought is cute and useless for hard work. It belongs in a dollhouse or the hands of a teenager writing emails and tweets. A waste of money. I bought a better one from another company.\n3. The magic mouse is the same ... cute and clever, but not ready for someone who needs to use the computer to write, edit, move documents, scroll around and navigate through web pages often. A waste of money. I bought a better one from another company.\n4. The Time Capsule I bought has great wifi and it works wonderfully with a Mac. However, not so much with anything else. It's dropped my PC on the wifi net so I can't use it to store or transfer data, which it still communicates very well with the Mac. So now the work-around is to move information back and forth with an HDD or flash drive. Ridiculous, I know. But I can't use the Mac to do the things the PC did for me so I have to have one foot in each system, still trying to make the MBP work.\n\nI spent a lot of time at the Apple store using my $99 one-to-one service being told \"No, you can't do that on a Mac.\" One-to-One service had its problems:\n\nLike the Apple products, the staff at the store was also attractive, smiling, rigid and unaccommodating. You do it their way or the highway. I do my professional work every day out of my laptop. The service included transferring all my data to the Mac, but they wanted me to leave it with them for three days even though the actual work would take far less time. Losing the machine for three days would be very hard. I had a three and a half day span in which I didn't have appointments so I could give it up for a day. I called them beforehand to ask if we could work together to get it done in one day. The woman didn't want to discuss it or hand me over to a manager. She told me to drive to the store to talk about it.\n\nI drove to the store that night after work and met with another employee, explaining I'd accommodate them any way they want as long as I just leave it for a day. She didn't turn me over to a manger. She told me to come back the next day to have it done as a one-to-one session. I came back the next day where the employee said he couldn't do this because he wasn't told it was a PC-to-Mac and he doesn't do that. He went back and forth to someone in charge, but wouldn't let me speak with anyone who could work with me. So he reiterated that the only way to do this was to leave it with them for three days, acknowledging that almost all that time it would be sitting on a shelf. I said no thanks.\n\nSo the bottom line is that\n1. The MBP is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities.\n2. However, you have to adjust yourself to what it will do, not what you want it to do. It does much less than what PC's do.\n3. It works extremely well with other Apple products. The synchronization between the MBP and my Apple TV, iPhone and iPad is amazing and easy.\n4. It does not work well with any other systems or products.\n5. It is not ready for many forms of professional use.\n\nRight now I'm in a quandary. I've spent a lot of money and massive amounts of time trying to make this into a professional's machine. Instead, it is becoming a toy I use for limited purposes in the field, bringing information back to the PC system to be managed, communicated and stored.  This is, of course, a very deep disappointment. I thought this had so much promise."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "So long story short I have been using PC's since the days of DOS. Stuck around with PC's till Windows 8.1, which was my last machine. I started looking at Macs because I was tired of dealing with spyware/adware, and I am an extremely careful user, it isn't like I go download warez. Also networking PC's together for an amateur got difficult a lot of the time. So I decided to switch and I sold my Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro and bought a 13\" Macbook Pro.\n\nI should have switched a long time ago.\n\nIt seems like everything in the Apple ecosystem is designed around what is easier for the user, what is more convenient, rather than the Windows approach which is to force a particular method of operation on you.\n\nMy observations:\n\nMagsafe magnetic power cord. Pure genius. I have damaged several laptop jacks over the years because of either myself tripping over power cords, or people tripping over power cords. It might sound crazy, but the MagSafe power cod was my main reason for going to Mac. I am not sure when the patent will run out and PC's can get it, but it works flawlessly.\n\nGlass trackpad: Simply the best in the industry. Many companies have tried to duplicate it and they have all failed IMO. The trackpad on my last machine was horrible. Apple has it down with the many gestures, they all work flawlessly.\n\nDesign: Solid aluminum, this is built like a tank.\n\nOS:X. Well I love it. Blows Windows 8.1 out of the water.\n\nThe only downsides about Apple products is the price. But you do get what you pay for. PC's are way cheaper, but if you have a problem with your computer you can't go online, make an appointment and talk with someone. The Genius bar is awesome. Sometimes you get free advice sometimes they charge you."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "Do not be fooled! This version of MacBook Pro runs on a third-generation CPU (\"Ivy Bridge\"), not the latest fourth-generation Haswell CPU the 2013 version has.  That means it has less battery life.  It also lacks a \"Retina\" display.  This is the 2012 model that you can buy at the Apple store for exactly the same price.  Not that it a bad laptop - not at all - but it is definitely not the \"newest version\" as the ad claims.  Naturally, the actual newest model, similarly equipped, costs more, but it is also in many ways a superior machine (the 500 gig HD is solid state for example).  That is no doubt why one reviewer says he recently bought both a MacBook Pro and MacBook Air and found the latter clearly superior.  The MacBook air with the Haswell CPU (which is what he evidently bought) has been available for far longer than the MacBook Pro with Haswell (introduced only about 1 month ago).  If you buy this laptop you may be completely satisfied - just be aware what you are really buying."}

I'm not going to detail all the pros and cons of Mac vs. Windows as that's pretty well covered out there already, but as far as MacBook's go, this one is a winner.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I'm a first time Mac user. I previously owned an older Dell laptop that died after about 5 or 6 years. I was skeptical at first. I thought the price was outrageous, still do, but I am glad I invested in it. I considered another Windows computer, I particularly like Windows 8 and I saw a lot of decent options from HP well under the Mac pricepoint. I visited a few stores to try them both out. But I decided since I have an iphone and ipad, it would be easier to link everything together if I got the Mac, so I did. You won't regret it! Its an awesome beautiful computer. It does everything I need, its fast, and its user friendly. If I ever run into a problem, I generally find my answer in the Apple support forums. They're extremely helpful. As far as insurance its costly, I wouldn't go with anyone besides Applecare or Best Buy's geek squad. Other cheaper options available on other sites are not trustworthy to me, plus they make you ship your computer out of the country and you are usually left without for weeks. No thank you. Bottom line, if you can afford it, get a Mac! If not, HPs are an awesome option as well, but consider lifespan and what type of user you are. Do your research!\n\nUPDATE:\nStill enjoying my Macbook Pro...considered trading for a newer model Macbook Air or Macbook pro w/retina. But after spending hours in the stores testing them out and reading reviews, I realized that although this model is older, it performs just as well as the newer models. The newer models are faster with downloading, but not a huge difference. I realized I would have to sacrifice features available on this model for thinness and faster downloading. Not worth the extra money I would have to spend and I'm comfortable knowing I could upgrade my 4GB ram to 8GB and my i5 to i7 whenever I want, if need be.  For me, this model works very very well and is not as heavy as it seems being compared to the Air or Macbook Pro Retina. She's a keeper!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I recently was fortunate enough to receive a 13.3 inch Mac Laptop as a christmas present last year. I am pleased to report that it is one of the best presents I have received to date. I had been wanting alaptop for a long time. In my home we have a desktop computer in the family room. This is where I would do all of my homework, but because of my other family members this became more and more strenuous. My mac laptop fixed this issue.\n  This laptop is a fine device, it is very sleek and modern. I actually enjoy using this laptop whenever I open it. The screen resolution is crisp and clear.  The 13 inch width of the screen works great for me. The screen doesn't feel to big but at the same time It still doesn't feel too small.\n  I have never used a mac before, and I was scared that my steep learning curve would be a major issue. But i was pleasantly surprised to find out that I was wrong. Much of the user interface on the mac is pretty intuitive. Also when their is something that a user does not know but needs to find out, google is a quick and easy way to find this knowledge.\n  Mac's also seem to be quite durable! i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it. Yet my mac continues to function properly. Also I have spilled water on it once or twice and my mac still continues to work perfectly.\n  I would recommend buying this mac to anyone who is looking for a sleek and trendy personal computer, that is also functional and durableThe cost is a bit high but worth it in my opinion. I doubt anyone will be disappointed after purchasing this product."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "Having a laptop while in college is essential to success and may contribute to overall achievement. A laptop provides easy access to Internet resources and keeping track of assignments that need to be due. Many modern homework assignments require using Internet or having to do research for classes. The Apple 13-inch MacBook Pro laptop is very practical for college students because of its easy to use features, fast performance, and new modern design.\n Often homework assignments require using a computer, which the MacBook Pro assists with because it provides Internet that can give information for research. In my opinion, Safari, the Internet browser that comes with the MacBook Pro is very fast and is extremely easy to use. As a result of having user-friendly features, Safari has a top sites page that contains frequently used websites. Also, in addition to top sites, there is unified smart search field that takes you right to the web page and fills in the entire URL when you enter a web address. MacBook's built-in sharing feature provides access to various web pages without having to leave Safari. By just clicking the Share button, you can choose how to send a web page by using Mail, which then gives you four options. Also the MacBook Pro has a fast performance that helps college students complete their work.\n The MacBook Pro provides many features, such as a dual-core Intel Core i5 that allows users to be able to take their laptops on the go. Also it has a 22-nanometer processor, cache, and graphics processor, and a fast 1600MHz memory controller on a single chip. Also applications like Aperture and Final Cut Pro help make work go smoother and faster because they automatically increase the speed of the active cores up to 3.7GHz. Hyper-threading technology allows two threads to run at the same time on each core and can get more jobs done. In addition to its high-quality features, it has an amazing new modern design that adds to the MacBook's overall easy usage.\n The new design contributes to assisting college students in need of getting work done because of its LED backlight technology that makes the display continuously bright. Also, on top of the screen is the built-in FaceTime HD camera that can be used to talk face to face through the laptop to loved ones or friends. The multi-touch trackpad is the button itself, which results in more room to click everywhere, which personally is nice because it is easier to double click when needed. Another valuable feature of design is the MagSafe Power Adapter's magnetic design, which is made to disconnect harmlessly from the port in case someone trips over the wire so it does not cause the laptop to fall.\n In conclusion, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is a wise investment for college students and any users interested in an easy-to-use productive laptop to help get work done. Having a portable computer is beneficial because it provides a place to store various information. Students looking for an all-in-one tool that can assist them in numerous aspects should definitely look into the Apple MacBook Pro laptop line. Its easy to use features, quick performance, and sleek design all contribute to the MacBook's overall productivity."}

It does not take as long to learn as I expected. After a few hours of usage however, I was having issues with it. The fan was at 6000rpm and the CPU usage was high. I am an Info Sys major in college, so I started researching this issue on my own. I found a solution but I was lacking files required to do it, so I gave in and called Apple. I told them that I just received my brand new MacBook but I was having issues. He looked up the serial number and told me it isn't new; that someone had registered my MacBook with Apple Care 50 days ago.\n\nWhen I ordered this, there was no mention that I was ordering a used/refurbished product. I refuse to buy used technology. Hopefully my replacement is brand new. I will be calling Apple as soon as I get it so they can check the serial number.\n\n**I definitely recommend a MacBook, just not sure if I would recommend buying one from Amazon.

It took 3 days to make an appointment at the local Apple store. I'm not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand $129 for a new battery, $39 to replace it and $139 for a new keyboard. I could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so I went to the Apple store myself and asked for a manager.  He explained to me the battery expansion is \"normal\".  Apple doesn't cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their Apple Care.  The battery is simply considered \"consumable\" and NOT covered.\n\nI asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the MacBook Air on the internet with the description that Apple doesn't consider the product defective.  His reply astonished me, looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said: \"Make sure you have your facts straight before you smear! They will contact you.\"  He didn't specify who are \"they\" but from the tone of his voice and his 6'5\" posture it indicated something between the SWAT team and a bunch of LAWYERS.\n\nHere is my take on all of this, the business model Apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from China, hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school, call them geniuses, and bully everybody who complains about their product.  Steve Jobs is dead, so is Apple.\nNo more Apple devices in my household.  Please Google \"MacBook battery bulge explode\" before you buy your next Apple toy."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "ANOTHER UPDATE:\nApple finally replaced the first one [see below] with a new one. It was a little hinky from the get-go.  In the past few months, things started to go really bad: random non-functioning keys,erratic touchpad, frequent weird crashes. Apple dx's bad hard drive, bad keyboard, bad touchpad, failing battery. Replaced all. I'd been backing up both to external hard drive and the cloud.  Apple warned that the external  hard drive data might have been corrupted from the bad hard drive [Time Machine read that it had not been backed up since mid March, when in fact its last back up was then day it went in for Apple repair, June 21]. Turned out to be true. Tried to restore from the cloud. MacBook shut itself off several times during restore attempt. When files for restore were finally downloaded, attempted to open them. MacBook crashed. Would not reboot. Would not reboot from safe mode. Back to the Apple store.\n\nI am writing this on my husband's six-plus year old HP pavillion, on which her writes several thousand words a day, six days a week. The case is cracked in several places, and is sracthed and dinged -- it's had a hard working life. And it has never gone in for repair.  Match that, Apple.\nUPDATE:\n\nTwo weeks shy of 1 year -- and thus almost out of warranty -- the logic board blew again. Counting the one this came with, this was the fourth to go down. Apple finally threw in the towel, and replaced the unit.  While I appreciate this, it is something that should have been done after the first replacement failed. Apple's failure to respond appropriately cost me not only time, but a significant amount of money lost when commitments couldn't be met (backing-up work means little, I've found, when you don't have a place to recover it to. Repair turnaround on this laptop averaged a week or more.) As I see it, Apple had an identified problem (witness similar complaints across the web) and their delay in acknowledging that this problem was not \"fixable\" was not just inconsiderate, it was irresponsible. Apple is allegedly a premium brand -- and yet they offer not only a product with quality control issues, but just-fell-off-the-back-of-a-truck customer service.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\n Just had the second motherboard replacement -- and this laptop is not even a year old! Also had one power cord replacement, one track pad replacement, USB port replacement...you name it, it's blown. \"Genius\" (sic) techs also screwed up my data recovery -- all but the most recent hour had been backed up, but I needed it -- we tried to attached the external disk drive before they sent it in, but somehow they crossed a couple of wires and fried everything. I had to pay an outside company, recommended by the Geniuses, to do data recovery. Said company explained it was not unusual for the Geniuses to screw up in this way.\n\nSearching the web, I see a lot of people have similar/identical problems with this model.\n\nObviously, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.\n\nHowever, if you want to take the risk, here are a few observations:\n\nI sent for the 13.3-inch, which in retrospect is a little tight. I probably would have sized up.\n\nI'm not crazy about the OS. It's not nearly as intuitive as they claim. And as for all the fancy finger swipes -- I just gave up and attached a mouse.\n\n(I have been a Mac desktop user for well more than 20 years, and a sporadic Mac laptop user. Right now I'm typing this on a five year old Gateway -- it ain't a Mac...but then Macs aren't Macs anymore, either.)"}

Within like 4 months mine had broke again (out of warranty now) And I was done. My sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason. I couldn't even open or close it. That defeated the whole point of a laptop. So I was done. I have wanted a Macbook for a while. And after me and my sisters multiple laptop problems I was willing to pay a lot to try Mac. I also thought it would be good now that I started College. I heard nothing but good things about Macs. I have been to the Apple Store for problems with my iPhone charging cord and it gets fixed, no problems, great service. And the warranty starts over when you get a new cord. I love that! And since I have a iPhone I get emails from Apple. I got a email for the Back to School Sale. I got educational pricing and Got this Macbook Pro 13.3 inch For $999. And Plus this promotion I got a $100 gift Card to the App Store. I thought that was the best offer I could get. So Me and My twin ordered it from the store. The gift card and the laptop came separately. And One thing I like was that when the gift card came, it did have a return address but it didn't say Apple so when people saw it they wouldn't steal the gift card. But You can tell that it was from Apple. When I opened the box for the Macbook, besides it having the charger for it, it had a extension to add to it. I didn't read anywhere that that was included but it is! I have been using the Macbook Pro for about 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it! I was new to the Mac system and It was pretty easy to use. The touchpad I was lost but I looked at videos on Youtube to figure out how to use the shortcuts and things. The software is fast. Laptop is comfortable, portable, and somewhat lightweight. Before I got the Back to School Promotion, I was thinking of getting the new macbook Air. But I wanted the Pro for the CD/DVD player. And since the educational pricing was $999 for the Pro, the original price of the Air, I decided on the Pro. I am using my Pro typing this. You can get the educational pricing all year long I saw. I did not know this when I bought it but that didn't change my mind that I wanted to get it anyway. I love how easy it is to use. Also I LOVE the feature of the light up keyboard. I use my computer for typing things and when I don't want to get up to turn on the light because I am focused or because I am to lazy, I can just turn the brightness up. I can close my laptop and when I open it, I type in my password and I am in within 1 second. My other laptops took like 2 minutes just to wake up. The battery Life on this laptop is AMAZING. Use like for 7 hours compared to the 2-3 hours of my other ones. I recommend this laptop for anyone! I will update later if any problems arise. ( I don't think any problems will arise)\nI do want to recommend that to save the battery, let the battery charge to 100% then unplugg it and let it totally die. Then Plug it back in. It makes the battery last long. :) I love my Macbook Pro! I hope it lasts me for years!"}

I have had PC's all of my life and have been afraid of Mac's because I was always told they were mysterious and complicated. That could not have been further from the truth, it is just a different type of operating system that downloads programs in app form. I just look at it as a bigger version of my ipod touch, same concept (well at least IMO).\n\nThe weight is a non issue for me, I am allowed to have a laptop in three of my four classes, so I only bring the laptop to school along with my tablet and for that other class a standard notebook. It suits me. I like the fact it has a optical drive, I don't care that optical drives are apparently on their way out and that apple now has something you can hook your other non optical drive mac's up too, I really like the freedom of not having to drag around another piece of technology and be able to use it whenever I want. This machine is solid, and built very well, call me old school, but with laptops I have always prefered solid and an optical disc drive.\n\nThe speed is wonderful, the sound is so-so, but it makes up for the performance of downloaded films from itunes. On my PC, the downloaded itunes films tend to lag, so it's really wonderful to be able to watch something and not have it lag and then freeze and then catch up with the dialogue a minute later.\n\nOne issue I do have is it does not seem to get along with my Google/Android devices (phone and tablet) that I have tried hooking it up too, does not regard them, nor bring them up. I guess I need a special program to be able to bring them up.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful machine. Well worth the money."}

But if you are migrating over to Apple to take advantage of the apparent bargains to be found in the professional software arena (Music Production, Video Production, Graphic Arts, etc.) I am issuing a warning that Apple is lying to you.  Apple has implemented an aberrant pricing policy that varies widely from the industry standard pricing policy for professional software.  Apple, in true corporate fashion, has made this change without warning or notice.  The new policy is NO PATH TO UPGRADE.  You heard me right.  If you pay professional software prices for a piece of Apple software, and two months later they release the new and improved package, you will be stuck paying full price for the upgrade.  Do you feel like you got a deal now?  You have now paid more for your software than if you had gone with the industry leading software package (PreSONUS, Adobe Premiere, CorelDraw, etc.) and next update, you will be well behind the pricing curve.  I do not have a problem with Apple software, but rather the sneaky way in which they implemented the pricing policy.  If you are buying Apple to take advantage of these apparent deals...save your money and stick with a PC.  You will pay more initially for your software, but within a year you will be saving money."}

I wanted a more powerful laptop with an optical drive and lager screen (my old Air was a 2011 i5 baseline model). So far I am very pleased with my upgrade. I love photography, and Photoshop runs very well on this machine with the occasional lag. The Sims 3 also runs very well on this laptop, but after about an hours use the laptop becomes very hot. The added storage space is great considering I upgraded from 64 gigs to 500gigs. The only complaint I have with the machine is that when booting up the laptop after its been asleep causes a delay ranging from 15-40 seconds. This can be very frustrating when you need to get work done immediately. One feature I love is that the laptop syncs with my Powermac G5, so the need for a flash drive to transfer files between the two is gone! All in all the laptop is great if you are upgrading from an older or less powerful laptop.\n\n*UPDATE*\n\nAfter upgrading to OS X 10.9.2 the occasional lag is gone!

And you're making it so hard.\n\nThe 13-inch MacBook Pro, back when it was simply called the MacBook, was a truly envy-inducing laptop. Debuting in the fall of 2008, it turned heads at coffee shops. It was the 15-inch Retina Display MacBook Pro of its time. No, it was better: it was the return, in a way, of the MacBook family to the more portable space once occupied by the 12-inch PowerBook G4.\n\nI digress because the looks of the 13-inch MacBook Pro haven't changed at all, really, since that fall. They haven't changed since last year, either. The 2012 MacBook Pro has newer third-gen Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, USB 3.0 ports, and better integrated graphics. That's it. The weight, the size, the battery life, and even the price remain the same. This is more of a spec bump than a new product. While the new 13-inch MacBook Pro is a little bit better than last year's 2011 model, the landscape for laptops is changing faster than ever.\n\nWindows laptops with similar components to the $1,199 13-inch Pro cost around $700. While the 13-inch Air has seen a price reduction, the Pro's continued status quo is all the more frustrating. Yes, the 13-inch Pro can be easily upgraded with more RAM or a larger hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD), and it has an optical drive and more ports, but it lacks the type of upgrades you'd expect on the higher, \"Pro\" end: no discrete graphics, no quad-core processor options, and no screen higher-res than 1,280x800 pixels."}

The exterior is absolutely gorgeous. The backlit keyboard is a great feature not to mention the key spacing makes typing so natural and easy. I also like how the rear apple logo stays lit while the laptop is on. When connected to Wi-Fi the Internet runs blazing fast and the screen quality is bright and crisp. Even after comparing this model with the MacBooks with retina display the little difference I saw didn't seem worth paying several hundred dollars more. 500GB is plenty of hard drive space for my needs and later on I might upgrade to 8GB of DDR3 memory but for now I'm very happy with its performance. I know some PC fans are hesitant to switch to a different operating system but honestly it's very easy to get used to especially if you've owned other Apple products in the past (i.e. iPhones, iPods etc...) The one and only thing I would change to match that of the PC laptops is on a MacBook tapping the touch pad does not serve as a \"click\" on a program. That's definitely a minor complaint so don't let my nit-pickyness discourage you. Sure MacBooks are a little pricey but take my word for it the investment is well worth it. These computers last on average 5-6 years which is way better than paying a little less and buying a PC laptop that is likely to break in a year. So if you're looking for a great laptop with amazing versatility get this one. You will not regret it."}

Soft touch, anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws. I love the little rubber seam that runs all the way around the edge of the screen that protects the screen from being scratched by the palm pads of the inner side. The keys are durable, and only start to wear out (become shiny) after about 1,000,000 hours of continuous use. I have another 2008 Black MacBook That has seen the most lengthy writing sessions with much sweating upon, and the keys still feel as good as new. I don't like the fact that the Screen is a fingerprint and dust magnet, but I fix that by wiping the screen down as a thing I do every Saturday Morning. The paint indicators on the side of the MacBook indicating which port is which has slowly become rubbed out from abrasion, but I know what port is now, so its ok. I wish I still had the paint in case I needed to sell it. The fan exhaust is located right under the screen hinge, and since it is easily covered, the laptop easily heats up. The trackpad is as smooth as velvet. I wish it was a entire button, so the trackpad wouldnt have to bend down when you press it at the top, but I've gotten used to the old way of thinking and using my thumb as a button-presser.\n\nSoftware:\nI can't say much\nI love Macintosh. Grew up with it from OS 8\nI love how seamless and flawless it is. I can't wait for Mavericks, and I know it'll be a bestseller.\nI really love the fact that Mac has an app store with its constantly growing database, and great games.\nI wish iLife came hooked up to your account as soon as you enter your apple id with icloud so you can update it as part of your app collection, but since it doesnt cost that much, its cool\n\nHardware:\nApple always has bleeding edge performance and I love their support of everything out there\nMy Mac rarely ever lags, and even when it does, (unless the fan is blocked), the fan is almost unnoticeable.

While I owned my PC I wasa big Mac fan and always longed for one. Long story short, I got it, and it was one of the best tech decicions I could have made.\n\nOperating System.\nPersonally, I find the Mac operting system like nothing else. After switching to Mac IOS I could never go back to windows. Mac just runs clean and smooth: simple as that. It has a great layout for everything to be visible and accesible and that is key. With the app store, it is easy to geta hold of your favorite programs no matter the category of intent.\n\nHardware\nI love how this is built with solid metal unibody because not only is it downright stronger, it gives the computer a more solid \"real\" feel to it, and I think that really adds to the experience. Once you buy your mac, the customer service is great, should you ever need it.\n\nPersonal\n\nI use mine for academics so it is great for writing papers and typing notes. It is also great for the heavier stuff such as powerpoints and iMovie presentations which are easy to create on the Mac os. It has thousands of tiny but usable features built into it like a VGA port for tv's and projectors. Also software things like voice dictation and keyboard short cuts to make everything run smoothely. I have the 320 GB hard drive and 4 GB of Ram Mac, and I never feel like I am in need of more. Even when I am running Itunes/Imovie and my email and browser in the background it works smoothly like nothing is open. I also own a King fire HD and I use apps like dropbox and evernote to sync my notes, powerpoints, and papers between these 2 devices. The battery life is great. It will easily last about 2-3 schools days without needing I charge, however I charge mine every night because I like the security of having a full battery in the mornin, just in case I need to compute something out of the ordinary. I like the flat and easy type feel of the keyboard, this is especially nice when taking notes quickly because the keys are ellusive and pop-up very nicely. The speakers are good, however I almost never use them, because I prefer studio headphones for personal use. The backlit keynaord makes dorm night homework much easier. The fans are great for keeping the Macbook pro cool for normal uses, but for Gaming you might want to consider a cool pad because it can get a bit hot. I don't play computer games too, too often, thus don't have one.\n\nI hope this helped, I would adivse anyone on the fence between this computer and another of similair value to consider the macbook pro closely."}

It is not faster than my 3 years old Toshiba Satellite E205 S1904 Laptop which cost me $100.00 less.\n2. The Keyboard of my Toshiba is as responsive as the keyboard of the Mac Pro, if not better.\n3. The Toshiba Keyboard is better lit than the Keyboard of the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro lit key board is just showmanship. Light is reflected around the edges of the letters and not through the letters as in the Toshiba.\n4. My Toshiba weighs 5Ibs and the Mac Pro is listed as weighing 4.5Ibs, yet the Toshiba feels lighter.\n5. My Toshiba laptop does not keep stains while the Mac Pro laptop is a stain attractant.\n6. My Toshiba is cooler than the Mac Pro when left running for hours.\n7. My Toshiba laptop is as quiet as the Mac Pro but when the Mac Pro revs up the fan speed, my Toshiba is quieter.\n\nMy only pros for the Mac Pro are :\n1. Longer battery life of 6+ hours while the Toshiba is 2.5hours.\n2. I do not play video games but I hear that the Mac Pro is good for gaming. Though I have not checked it out, I give this point to Mac Pro.\n3. No need for antivirus software as opposed to my windows 7 based Toshiba laptop which has one.\n\nThe Mac Pro is a decent laptop but not an extra ordinary laptop as these reviews would want you to believe. I am giving it a 3 stars because I do not think it surpasses my Toshiba laptop which I rate as 4 stars (-1 star for very short battery life of 2.5hrs)."}

I quickly adapted to the changes in the OS, and adore the different finger swipes to move from webpage to webpage and desktop to desktop. The screen gives a clear, crisp picture. It downloads and streams quickly. Honestly, things that took me an hour to do on my old Mac now take half or even 1/3 the time.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "Years ago I only use XP, but the debacle with Vista left me looking for a new OS.  I turned to Linux distributions.  Ubuntu, Mint, and many others offer a great variety of OS to fit my needs.  After years of doing that, I tried my first Mac.  So, here's an aging geek's take on the Mac.\nGetting accustomed:\nThe first time you start a Mac it take a few minutes to understand the gestures.  What makes all the screens visible, shifts from one workspace to another, and scrolling a page.  Within a few hours I was using the gestures unconsciously.  I found my experience was not atypical when a friend bought her first Mac and was able to make the gestures a habit within a day of on and off use.\nBrowsing files and starting programs is a little different that windows, but it's easy to figure out.  To browse local files, use the Finder and to find a program, use the Launchpad.\nCompared to Windows 8, figuring out how to use a Mac is a walk in the park.  I have a Win8 machine gathering dust because of this laptop.\nHardware:\nI built many computers.  Most of then are 4+ cores and built for speed.  Apple hardware is not the newest, but it's rock solid.  They make products that work!  Everything is fluid and intuitive- something that can't be said about Win8.\nSoftware:\nLike it's hardware, these Macbooks have well tuned software that simply works.  For those who need to use a Windows program, a program called Parallels works very well to run those programs on a Mac.\nPrice:\nYes, you pay a premium for this kind of hardware and software.  Is it worth it?  If you are looking for a long term, everyday laptop- the Macbook is an ideal choice.  If you need something that will get trashed (going on deployment, you tend to drop your laptop, ect) or you just need something short term, maybe an investment in a laptop isn't best.  For some people, a tablet is a better choice.  Samsung makes the Note 10.1 and 8 which read handwriting very well.  Choose hardware that will fit your life.\nOverall:\nGreat product for home and/or business users that need a full laptop.  Instead of buying a low cost laptop every 2-3 years, get a Mac which will last you 10 years.\nNote:\nPlease take care of your battery, no matter what laptop/tablet you have.  Try to fully discharge a battery before recharging it.  When recharging it, recharge it fully.  Please, please, don't leave a laptop plugged into the wall all day- you are killing the battery.  Charge, drain, repeat."}

It's either too sensitive or not sensitive enough, always jumping around to different pages and not scrolling when I try to. I'm very disappointed in this purchase and will not buy another Apply product. One of the Mac software updates just froze my whole system and they had to wipe my hard drive to get my computer working again. I've never had so many issues with a computer in less than a year.

I primarily use the computer for school, but it can easily handle extensive tasks (video editing, photoshop etc.) as well. The battery life is good usually averaging between 6-7 hours. I was surprised to discover that this machine can do gaming also, it runs League of Legends and Team Fortress 2 at 60 FPS on the native 1280x800 resolution. OS X is really great at letting you multi-task with ease. I would recommend increasing the ram in order to increase performance on your machine. I installed a 16GB ram kit from Crucial and I noticed an immediate increase in performance. The backlit keyboard is amazing to type on. I have typed for hours and have yet to feel fatigued. The MacBook Pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer. For those wondering whether to get the MacBook Air or the Pro I would recommend buying the Pro. The MacBook Pro (non-retina) is easily customizable, just buy a SSD and ram and you will have a blazing fast machine in your hands. I hope this review helps."}

This model comes with 4GB memory, easily upgradable for minimal cost (I've read confirmed reviews of people successfully putting 16GB of memory in this laptop on newegg.com).

Not only was it referbrished/used, but I was paying so much more than a brand new apple macbook pro would of cost. Got ripped off too. Yeah. I should've looked into that more, but I was right out of high school, so I didn't know much. And let's just say my old macbook pro is hunk piece of junk. Everything that went wrong with it did which I won't get too much into, but I wanted a replacement. PC laptops, I wasn't too crazy about, so I decided to go with an updated version of the Macbook Pro.\n\nI had to decide between the this and the Retina Display. I wanted the Retina Display one so bad. I think I wanted it mainly because it is thinner than the regular macbook pro, but did I really want to pay $400 more just for that. It did have other features, yes, but I won't pay $1400 for a laptop. I would do a $1000 for a brand new one though. Getting it in the mail is like Christmas! ALl packaged up securely and when I opened it, it was perfect.\n\nI had a 4-5 year old macbook pro. So there were some pretty big changes that I am still getting use to. The trackpad is a little confusing, it scrolls in opposite directions and you can click anyway in there. I think that's the biggest thing I have to use to. It is smaller in size, like weight like, I'm talking about. Love the black keyboard with the lighting. Finally I have photo booth again! I missed it. I am still basically messing around with it, but I remain in love with it.\n\nI have had my ups and downs with Apple products in the past, but honestly apple remains to be the best in my opinion.

I love this computer!\n\nI'd recommend this laptop to any laptop seeker! Choose Apple over Dell, it's worth the slightly extra cost!\n\nAlso, in concern over buying this computer from Amazon vs. the Apple website. I saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from Apple and I was concerned but I took my chances and am overly impressed. It's a brand new computer and completely wrapped up safe in the box from Apple. No problems whatsoever. It's worth it to buy from Amazon cheaper because there is no difference in buying from Apple besides the price!"}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I wanted to love this computer... I really did.  Apple makes a fine product but, I have had very bad luck with them, and they are simply over priced.  For me, If this computer ran fast, stable and efficiently, it would have been worth the cost.  However, this has not been my experience so I am returning this product.\n\nI first purchased my macbook off of amazon and it ran glitchy out of the box.  The trackpad was erratic and unstable and programs crashed out of the box.  I contacted apple who gave me the typical line \"well, you have to buy it directly from us to be sure it is good\".  So I sent back my macbook and went through all the trouble of getting a return.  I purchased a new macbook at the inflated apple cost and got my second computer.  I soon realized that I was having more problems that were related to the operating system.  For one thing, I bought this computer to edit movies.  iMovie was a laughably bad program which was non-intuitive and hard to learn.  I shelled out the money to buy Adobe Premier which is an awesome program that I was able to figure out without seeking help.  Unfortunately, this particular program runs very glitchy on a mac.... but wait, I thought these computers were supposed to run these type of programs better than a PC.\n\nOn top of that there is a massive learning curve when you are switching over from a PC to a Mac.  I don't care was Apple says, Macs are NOT more intuitive then PC's... especially when organizing files.  I ended up spending hours on the phone with apple care to learn how to perform system functions that should be intuitive enough to figure out on my own.  Now, don't get me wrong... this is NOT apple's fault.  Macs are different from PC's and they take time to learn.  However, what IS apple's fault is that they only give you a 14day return window when you order a 1500+ product from them.  This is insulting and unacceptable and is the main reason why I am sending back my second Macbook.  If I was given a more appropriate return window, I likely would have stuck with it but apple is twisting my arm to return it while I can still get my money back.\n\nSo in the end, here is my final point.  Apple makes a fine product.  However, it has been my experience that shelling out the big bucks for this product DOES NOT GUARANTEE that you are going to escape the headaches of dealing with a PC.  My experience was that I had spent three times as much for buy a product that included the same headaches as a PC if not more.  Keep this in mind when you are purchasing one.  In the end, I think it is better to buy this product from amazon because they actually have a BETTER return policy than Apple themselves."}

First off, I really do like my MBP... once used to the OS it is pretty easy to get around, and the overall build is great... eg the keyboard is one of the best to type on. But about a week after I got it, it started to randomly lose wifi... sometimes once a day, sometimes five times in five minutes. I contacted Apple Care 3 times about the issue. They did what they could (which was nothing except tell me that they would fix the problem over and over without ever admitting that there was a any \"real\" problem). Though friendly, Apple Care was far from truly helpful. I looked up online and found that this is a persisting and common problem with Macs. Apple refuses to admit that there is a problem and maintains that even though there are thousands of bloggers with their own angry stories. Macs are sold and marketed as a business and school laptop... but it fails miserably since it cannot be relied upon for a business transaction or a online test (my sister bought the same one and has the same problems... she prays every time she takes an online exam it doesnt disconnect). On top of that the track pad is now randomly becoming unrsponsive to trying to click a selectioin and sometimes even just to move the cursor. My sisters has similar problems to include \"losing\" the cursor and spending a good thirty seconds messing with the track pad to get it to reappear. 1200 bucks for a laptop that cannot do the simplest things correctly... on top of all that, I have been restarting it at least once a day to keep it working... eg skype camera won't work unless I have just restarted it and my internet when connected will not work until I do the same. GOOGLE these problems and YOU WILL SEE that I am not alone.... What a dissapointment."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I purchased a new MacBook Pro 2011 model February 2012. Every day I had this computer, something failed on it. The most-common failure is the computer failed to sync with my other apple products. Every time I attempted to sync the laptop, it would fail the first couple of times.\n\nThe second most-common problem is that the computer would hang, most of the time while I was doing work on it. Once it even hung while attempting to draw the login box just after power up.\n\nThe third most-common problem is that the bottom of the laptop would get so hot, that I could not touch it without burning my hands or legs. I am hoping that the laptop does not start a fire in my home when I am away from the laptop and it is transcoding my video files.\n\nThe fourth most-common problem is that the laptop screen would just go black for 3 to 30 minutes before I am able to power on my system.\n\nThe Fifth most-common problem with the laptop is that the laptop is not holding a charge. I could have a full charge and unplug it from the adapter and within one hour my battery would be going dead.\n\nI initially took my laptop to the Apple Store in South dale Mall sometime in July or August 2012. The tech ran some diagnostics on the laptop and reported to me that the logic board needed to be replaced. My system was held at the store for about two days.\n\nIn November 2012 I took my laptop back to the Southdall Mall because I was experiencing the same issues and at that time I talked with three different techs for about two hours. The technition reset the SMC and parametric memory. They also re-install the OS X operating system from the delivery DVD. None of the attempted repairs worked.\n\nI have taken my laptop to the Apple store in the Lenox Square Mall multiple of times for this issue and they to has failed to resolve my issue and has failed to log that I have brought my laptop in for service. This store representative is rude and I am not happy with the condescending attitude that Apple employees via store and phone has given me.\n\nHaving paid for a brand new laptop, I am quite unhappy with the sequence of events that left me with a refurbished laptop. I feel that I am owed a substantial compensation. The \"new\" laptop that I purchased turned out to be such a lemon. I also feel that I was sold a faulty unit and I have endured frustration for months.\n\nI thought I was purchasing a premium laptop, I feel that I have been cheated and not provided with what I paid for. Because of all the trouble that I have encountered since I received this laptop, I could have purchased a PC at a cheaper cost and could have had multiple of systems for the price I paid for this Mac Pro.\n\nThe Apple Care Product Repair Summary talks about ensuring \"the highest level of quality and reliability.\" That is certainly NOT what I have experienced. My confidence in Apple products has been greatly degraded because of this experience. Can you apple still want to attempt to troubleshoot my computer after a year?"}

I was finally done with high school and moving on to bigger and better things. All my life I had been striving for the best and getting my first laptop was not going to be anything short of the best. After my graduation party and selling my car, I finally saved enough money to purchase my first `real' life purchase. I knew I wanted a MacBook Pro since early senior year and now was the time that I was finally going to get it! I begged my mom to come with me to Best Buy to help me buy it. She didn't see the need to come with so I brought my sister. Checking and double checking that I had the right amount of money in my checking account I told the sales woman that I'd like to buy a MacBook Pro 13 inch. She gladly went to the back to get it and without hesitation I swiped my debit card. A screen popped up asking if I wanted to purchase insurance. Being the 18-year-old kid with only a new laptop on my mind, I stupidly said no thanks. After signing my life savings away, I walked/ran out of the store carrying my new `baby', just as the store was closing for the night.\n Getting home I opened the box and started to set-up and install all of the new and coolest things on my computer. At around 12:30 that night, after convincing my mom that Macs never had any problems and they were the best laptops around, my laptop completely shut down. It was charging so I knew the battery was fine, but it still wouldn't turn back on. Reluctantly I walked downstairs with tears forming in my eyes. How would I tell my mom that it wasn't working. After spending what seemed like days on her laptop searching what could be wrong, we decided to call the Apple helpline. They were dumbfounded, just as we were. They said that we must have gotten the `lemon' and that I should not have any problems returning it tomorrow for a new one. It was the longest night of my life. Waking up at the crack of dawn, we exchanged the `lemon' for a new one, as well as bought the highest amount of insurance possible. I've now had it for almost a year and have not had any problems with it. If I had to choose a MacBook over a windows laptop, I would still pick the MacBook hands down even with the small mishap in the beginning. I definitely think that the saying of `good things happen to those who wait,' truly applies to me, if I waited rather than being rash, I would have had no problems with my `baby.'"}

Coming from windows was not an easy transition however. Macs are confusing as balls. You download something and it dissapears forever....until you find it. You try to drag a file to your desktop screen and all you've accomplished was creating two of that file. Which is terrible if your moving 34Mb raw audio files. Once i figured out how everything works (about a week) i found that working on a Mac is just waaaaaaay faster and more productive than working on windows. From the DAW perspective, Mac doesn't support VST format...so thats kind of an issue. Your plugins have to be AU format and theres not many of them out there. Sucks. But...this computer comes with iLife or whatever its called. Basically Garageband, and some photo and video editing software (dont care). Garagebands not bad. Its like a super dumbed down version of Logic, which is Mac only anyway, so probably a good place to start. It comes with pretty much everything you'll need to start recording. Got a guitar, and that rocksmith game? well, macbook pro recognizes that cable and you can record directly into your usb port into garageband. pretty cool. No driver install necessary...like on a windows computer, where you would need ASIO4ALL or something. Performance wise, its not the fastest laptop in the world...but theres an i7 core model that probably runs like lightning, and people are putting extra memory in these computers anyway. $100 from crucial.com. Its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i've had it. it was right in the middle of recording tho, so that sucked. So far, only 1 hiccup, no viruses still got plenty of memory even with buttloads of plugins and software installed. runs smooth. 4 out of 5."}

Realizing that I use the desktop computer most of the time but need a portable only on occasion, I chose the basic MacBook Pro. It operates in closed clamshell mode, so it's out of the way, and---unlike the MacBook Air---it has all the necessary ports to function as a desktop computer. It connects to all of my existing hardware: 19-in. LCD monitor (Mini DisplayPort-to-DVI adapter purchased separately); external storage device; printer/scanner; keyboard/mouse; speakers/headset. Since I use the laptop screen so infrequently, I passed on the additional expense of Retina Display."}

It's awesome knowing that I can sit down and do my homework online with no popups, no virus, and no distractions. I have had my computer for about four years now and never have had any problems with it. I loved it so much that I decided to get a Mac Book Pro, which is a laptop. Again, no popups or any type of distractions when I'm really trying to focus on line. My laptop is so light that I can take it with me anywhere. The battery life is amazing. I feel like I can be on it all day long without it being plugged into an outlet. It has a perfect size screen and many different USB plug ins so I can always have my phone charging or a hard drive plugged in. It allows me to download any apps that I might need for school or just to have for my personal life. I would recommend a Mac to anyone that is looking for a laptop."}

Next, the Macbook Pro insisted that I accomplish \"migration\" of pc files before I get to use it in any way. How am I supposed to know about such things? Anyone's guess!\nBut the worst part of all is that no help tutorial files can be opened and watched for any apps-NONE!\nAfter many hours with the so-called help, nothing. They are absolutely clueless as to why those help files cannot be opened. They said that it is Hughesnet's fault. Hughesnet says it's Apples fault.

My PC's have lasted for at least 3 years of heavy use before I encountered any problems with them.\n\nI never liked APPLE, and this incident  reaffirms my thoughts of the company. They are nothing more than a consumer hype company. Don't waste your money purchasing a Mac. Don't buy into the hype.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I am a PhD student, and I need my computer to handle everything from Photoshop to Pymol, and LaTEX to InDesign, and this notebook works perfectly. The battery lasts as advertised (give or take 15-20 minutes), and the entire user experience is very elegant. I like the little quirks of the latest operating system as well (full screen mode!). I had a Powerbook G4 11.6\" before, and that little beast lasted nearly 6 years (one battery change, RAM upgraded later), and the build quality on that computer was awesome. I mean I accidentally dropped it multiple times, had minor spills on the keyboard, and it still went strong. Finally, it was slowing down considerably last year, and the fan noise kept getting louder, so I was looking for a new laptop. I have always been a fan of Apple laptop's build quality, and the friendliness of the operating system. I am a proficient user of Windows as well, but I always find that the hardware manufacturers always let the operating system down. I compared the quality of Sony Vaio 15\" S series computer at a local Microsoft Store (with Signature), and though the prices for both the Mac and Sony Vaio were very similar, the overall computing experience was far superior on a Mac.\n\nI have used this computer for quite a while now, and this computer works very well. No glitches, no hang-ups - nothing but smoothness. I highly recommend this computer to any new buyer. Once this laptop has served its purpose (a few years time, perhaps), I will definitely stick with Macs. I am definitely eyeing the Mac 13.3\" with Retina Display."}

All of the features in this computer are top of the line and the materials like pure aluminum casing this is truly remarkable that they could put this into a computer and i promise you will like it and apple is so responsive if you have any questions they are there for you promise. this computer is really great but here is just a suggestion get the 13 inch one because the 15 inch is a little to big and i now this because my friend has a 15 inch and they wish they got the 13 inch like me but they still love it  and this is still awesome to so don't get me wrong this is a great computer to.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "this review is about my personal honest experience, i am not a computer wizard.\n\nlike most of you, i had a hard time thinking which one to buy, an air or a pro. what i did is purchased the two and see which one will better suit my needs and send back the one that I won't like. so I went at my local best buy and did so. after using both products for 14days, here are my thoughts.\n\nthe macbook air looks very beautiful on the outside. it's so thin and light and can be used anywhere like a tablet. to sum things up, the MB air is more of a fashion statement than a work horse. is it faster than a pro? yes only by 10-15secs during start up. the audio quality sounds thin but loud. the pro has a deeper sound. air has higher resolution but the fonts are small. what I hate about it is the screen display color. macbook pro by far has more vivid colors and if you love to watch netflix and hd videos like me, the pro is a better choice. i like the design of the air but i'm sorry to say that it is more like a toy than a real life laptop. if you have a main computer, the air is a very good addition but if you only need an all in one computer like me to take with you, store data, watch videos, do picture and video editing and plan to use for a very long time, then the macbook pro is a better choice and for me is more sturdy. one reviewer says that the air has better screen display but I don't agree with that because i am an amateur photographer and im pretty sure i know which has the better display. in the long run you will be needing that dvd drive, the storage and ram that you can customize, the ethernet and ports that are already built in and most of all the screen display. the macbook pro still looks stunningly beautiful and is a more capable laptop. even the keyboard is better to type on. the air is super light weight but the pro still is light. we still need to use our muscles sometimes. battery life are identical 5-6 hrs.\n\nI got more from my money on the pro and it is a better choice for me that's why I kept it and sent the air back for a refund. again this is just my personal honest opinion."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "This is my first review on Amazon so please bare with me.\n\nI am a college student that was looking for a laptop. And at first I was thinking I was going to get something like a i7 with dedicated Gpu windows computer. But I am glad I didn't!\nFOR ALL WINDOWS FANS, first of all I want to share that I do not hate windows since I game on my windows desktop that I built myself. But my experience with windows laptops has not been the best. Always had miscellaneous problems with video drivers, screen, touch pad you name it! But I thought to myself that hey! at least I have really good spec laptop. Wrong! once I switched to mac all those things seemed unacceptable! I have now noticed that apple really take their time making their laptops and quality is there as well! Now here are some of my reviews of the specs.\n\nCpu- although its a dual core it has more than enough speed for everyday use\nGpu- although its a integrated gpu it has more than enough everyday power for regular use. (unless your a gamer, or need the dedicated gpu for high demanding work) , which a lot of us do not need for college.\nHard drive - this is the one thing I am considering upgrading for the 5400 rpm speed to a 7200 rpm hard drive since it is a cheap but effective upgrade for boot times and opening apps.\nRam - this I am not even considering upgrading since this ram is fast and 4GB is more than enough for everyday use. The only reason I would upgrade is if I would be running many apps at the same time.\nScreen - although some people might complain about low res which I think is ridiculous. I will also say it is much better than I expected! Since the contrast of colors makes it seem so crisp! I would go as far as saying the colors and contrast is better than some pc laptops with higher res screens.\nCooling design- I also think this is better since MB's do not has fans under and on the sides where when you have it on your lap it will suck in a considering of dust. The mac-book's cooling system is made in a way where you can actually consider it a LAP top.\n\nOther things like DVD-RW drive was my deal breaker to get the non-retina pro since I need it.\nAlso the network plug is a plus since if you do not have reliable wifi it will come in handy!\nBack-lit keyboard which also was a must and is am glad to say it is very good.\nSpeakers- are the one thing I miss from my windows laptop. Since these are loud enough if there are no loud obstructions near you, but do not let throw you off because they are fine for moderate noises for example: at starbucks.\nTouchpad- this is the most profound thing that makes any other touchpad inferior and make it feel way ahead of it's time! Makes web browsing a breeze and switching either from windows, to desktop or anything a breeze!\n\nThis laptop is light enough to carry in your backpack the whole day. Has a nice aluminum finish, but I considered getting a sleeve and case to ensure I would not damage or scratch it.\n\nIf you need the extra performance I would strongly urge you to get a 15\" MBP since they have the added dedicated Gpu, i7 Cpu, and better speakers.\nIf you need a windows operating system for a app then I would urge you to partition your hard drive for both os systems since you will still use mac os much much much more!\n\nAll in all many people (like me) think they need a high spec laptop for school which is not true! I would strongly urge you to try out a macbook! It made me switch and I am sure you will too!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I needed to upgrade to Lion but my old platform (MacBook vintage 2008/9) was not upgradable.  It was also suffering from hardware (keyboard) issues, relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime.  I chose the MBP over the MacAir because of the extra ports, DVD burner, etc, accepting the extra weight which was not that important to me.  I love the new platform, though it took some getting used to with the Launch Pad and Command Center paradigms.\n\nCon:  The only small complaint I have is the power cord attachment to the laptop.  It has a 90 degree bend in it that either requires the cord to bend along (and partially cover) the various ports on the side of the laptop or bend away to the rear which generates a long loop for me the way I plug it it with the possibility of accidentally popping out.\n\nPro:  Besides delivering the higher level performance that I expected of the new platform, the display on the MBP is much better than my old MacBook which had a poor quality display with a waviness I never liked and poor off-angle viewability."}

Assisting this person in learning the Apple system I was forcefully reminded about the differences between Windows and OS X. Accessing resources in Windows, by comparison is quite clumsy, and the ready access to OS X resources is so in-your-face that it's confusing to someone who has limited their use of their PC in the past from the lack of ease in finding what they wanted. Although Microsoft and Microsoft-based computers have replicated many of the interface features of the Apple system, the native functions of an Apple computer running Apple software is remarkably more intuitive. This person needs to unlearn many of their Windows habits, just as I did when I moved to Apple.\n\n2/23 Addition - After reading a few of the five-star reviews on this product, I feel I should apologize for my wimpy review above. About three years ago, I bought my first Mac, a MacBook Pro 13\" and experienced the genuine thrill of using this excellent machine. I assumed most of the reviews would be from confirmed Mac users, but was pleasantly surprised to find that most were like me, converts from Windows. So I want to join the chorus of praise for these excellent machines, dictating this review from my 11\" inch MacBook Air, my constant companion. Of course everything I do on my Air is shared with my MacBook Pro \"portable desktop\" as well as my iPod Touch, perhaps the most important thing about the Apple system. For you newcomers, welcome home.\n\nBy the way, I lied. My first Mac was actually a Mac Classic II, the little box that ate the lunch of all the PCs that existed in 1992. My work \"converted\" me to Windows laptops until 2009."}

My machine is amazing this is my favorite model because the new retina MacBook Pro  is not self upgradable AT ALL . so I enjoyed upgrading my computer on my terms instead of apple overcharging their upgrade on order section.\n\nBut overall if your a creative type or a business professional this is an absolute MUST BUY as I guarantee satisfaction , great durability , nice software with Mountain Lion , sdx card slot , you will a very happy customer. I have had this computer since early July 2012 and I have had no issues OF ANY KIND . NO BUYERS REGRET OVER HERE."}

If you are switching from a pc, it might take some getting used to, ask someone to show you the details. There is an app store for this laptop just like the iPhone, but the apps are usually more expensive than android apps. Of course Skype, evernote, dropbox are free.

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I will leave my initial review below. I called Apple support, and after working with a Tier One advisor who was not very informed, I was escalated to a Tier Two advisor.\n\nThis is my second experience in 20 years with Tier Two Apple support. The first in the 90s, the second in 2013. Both experiences are the best tech support I have ever experienced, by far. In this example, my router's firmware was old and needed updating. The advisor tried several things, then had me look at the router. He helped me update my router's firmware, even though my router is not an Apple product! Because that's what it would take to resolve my problem.\n\nI am not experiencing internet problems anymore. Apple has successfully turned a situation around from regretfully wanting to return my computer to being completely satisfied.\n\nI give 4 stars instead of 5 because of my experiences at the Apple Store and with the Tier One advisor. If they had taken me seriously, I would have been able to resolve the problem sooner.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI really want to give a good review. I had a mac in the 90s, back when only graphic artists and schools had them. It lasted for years, easy to upgrade.\n\nI cheaped out after that and bought several PC laptops, none of which lasted over 4 years. So, I decided to spend the dough and go back to a mac.\n\nI cannot maintain a wireless connection. Sometimes, it goes out every 3 minutes. Sometimes, if I'm lucky, I get as much as 20. Doing the research I, admittedly, should have done before purchase, I find that thousands of people are having the same problem.\n\nI have purchased a cheap wireless adapter, rather than do what the Apple store advised, which was to buy a new router (none of the other computers in my household have any problems). Hopefully, bypassing the mac's wireless capabilities will do the trick.\n\nBut, that is pretty pathetic for an $1,100 machine, right? Plus, Apple seems to be in denial over the issue. They should at least be honest with their customers. Their own support forums are overflowing with people reporting this problem:\n\n[...]\n[...]\n[...]\n[...]\n[...]\n[...]\nLike I said, I am far from a mac hater. I was really excited to receive this laptop, and I wish I could give it a good review. But wireless connectivity is mission critical. Sorry, Apple, this is a fail. I had to restart my wifi 2 times during the course of writing this review."}

I don't like that I have to buy Antivirus or Spyware software with Windows based computers. I keep it simple and I surf, check email and use Word. So I expect no problems. Mac gives me that unlike Windows. The only complain is price. It is more expensive compare to other windows based laptops but you get a more stable laptop with Macbook and it is worth the extra buck."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "For a premium laptop sold in 2013, the Apple MacBook Pro (13 inch, base model) is about as basic as it gets: no SSD, no discrete graphics, no 1080p display, and no touch screen. But Apple does not pretend it has any of these. What it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side, Apple's OSX Mountain Lion, the sleek looks Apple always delivers, reasonable specs, good battery life, nice keyboard, and excellent trackpad.\n\nNow, the question is, who is this computer for? Those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag, and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use Macs. The average computer user will be served better by a Macbook Air, since it is faster (for basic tasks), lighter, and has a higher-res antiglare screen. The MacBook Pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac, but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution. This Mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair. Hard drives can be replaced, RAM can be added as needed, and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge. The processor is roughly 15% faster than the one inside the Macbook Air, which also extends this computer's usable lifespan.\n\nThe fact that the screen is fairly low-res for the price (MBP 13 has a res of 1280x800, while other windows laptops have a res of 1600x900 for the same price), really detracts from my personal experience with the computer. The retina display of my iPhone 5 has indeed spoiled me, and Apple should update the screen of the MBP 13 or bring down the price of the retina model. This, added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money, detracts from the computer's value. Lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five-star purchase, but for the price, this is a four star (good) computer. Those looking to drop $1200 on a new laptop will have to decide if the upgradability and processor performance is worth the money over the sleeker MacBook Air. In addition, if Mac OSX is not something you enjoy using, then I would advise that you look elsewhere for a laptop.\n\nTLDR version: good, reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "This is not my first Mac computer, and certainly will not be my last. Before I begin, I will say that I am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - I am not an Apple fanboy. I have owned many PC computers as well, and like them too. I currently own a Lenovo laptop as well as my new MacBook Pro, and each have their own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nTo start with the strengths:\n1. OSX Lion is a great performer..extremely fast and reliable. I have it installed on my iMac desktop computer as well and love it. Not to mention this comes with a free upgrade to Mountain Lion, which is very nice.\n2. Screen looks great. Even though it is not the Retina display you can get on the 15.4 inch model, the screen is fantastic. Very bright and crystal clear with excellent color.\n3. Quietest laptop I have ever owned. Keeps quiet even when the computer is under a heavy load.\n4. First computer I have owned with USB 3.0. I bought an external hard drive when I purchased this laptop as well so I could utilize the USB 3.0. I got the hard drive yesterday and transferred all of my files from my old laptop to the new hard drive so I could put them on my MacBook. It took about 1/5th of the time it did with USB 2.0.\n5. My Lenovo laptop does not have an illuminated keyboard, so the keyboard on this laptop is a big plus in my opinion. Excellent for people that like to work or surf the web while their significant other is sleeping.\n6. The trackpad - can't even compare it to any trackpad I have seen on any other laptop computer.\n7. Excellent battery life while being a very fast performer. It definitely has the best of both worlds. I average about 6 hours on a charge. My Lenovo (with similar graphics, processor, etc. and same use) only lasts about 4 or 5 hours on a full charge.\n8. Typical Apple simplistic styling. I love the look of the Apple products. Simple and clean.\n9. Many, many more...but those are the most notable ones to me.\n\nNow, for the weaknesses.\n1. The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip. They may get softer and more sticky as time goes by, but right now they are far from that. The pads on the bottom of my Lenovo are definitely much better and don't allow the computer to slide around while I am using the computer on a glass topped desk.\n2. Price - it's a bit pricey for the performance you get, but the added perks of Mac OSX and the durability and support of Apple products makes up for it. For the same price, you can get a PC with more memory, larger hard drive, better graphics, and a faster processor, but then you remember you're running Windows 7, which isn't nearly as well built as Mac OSX.\n\nIn conclusion - this is a great laptop. Although it is a little pricey, it is well worth the extra money. So far, the only issue I have with it (rubber pads) is a very small problem that does not change how this laptop performs in any way.\n\nIf you are thinking about getting a MacBook Pro laptop but do not want to spend a huge amount of money for one, this is definitely the way to go. It may be considered the \"base model\" MacBook Pro, but it still an excellent computer. The size and battery life of this computer makes it excellent for people that need a laptop that is very mobile. Between work and college classes, I needed a lightweight yet durable computer and this definitely fits that criteria."}

The issue is we can no longer upgrade to the newest version of OSX thus we don't get the benefits of the new features. The new MBP offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months. Something we did often when we purchased Windows based laptops.\n\nApple OSX is simple to use and has a more enjoyable and intuitive interface than the new Windows 8. I'm not saying it's for everyone but it's a great solution if you want a simple to use device that you know won't be at the end of it's life cycle in a couple of years.\n\nPros\n-Great functionality\n-Integration with iCloud and many of the apps you use on an iPad and iPhone.\n-Log battery life even with wifi on and streaming movies via netflix\n-Very durable unibody case\n-Still has an optic drive\n-Mag Safe power cord is a nice touch\n-Intel i5 processor works very well\n-The chicklet keyboard is AWESOME!\n-The single best function is the backlit keyboard. There is nothing worse than trying to work on a plane and not being able to see the keys without an overhead light that blinds you.\n-The track pad is incredible. I'm a person that will not use a laptop without a mouse. I just don't like trackpad's because they never work right. That is until now. I can easily use the Apple Track Pad without any issues and now I don't even travel with a mouse. My bag just got a little lighter. I do however like the Apples Magic Mouse but I really don't need it.\n-It just works. We found that out when our new MBP found all the office and home printers, installed drivers and started working with no effort on our part.\n\nCons\n-Heavy compared to Ultrabook laptops\n\nRecommendations: I would definitely recommend 8 Gigabytes of RAM. Just because the processor is a 64bit architecture and can efficiently utilize the RAM. I wouldn't by the factory RAM just because it's expensive. Amazon has a nice selection of RAM from various suppliers that will work. We went with the Corsair Vengeance 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) Laptop Memory (CMSX8GX3M2A1600C9).\n\nIf you have never installed RAM in a Mac Laptop go out on YouTube and watch a couple of videos. It's very easy to do but it's nice to have someone walk you through it first to get a little confidence."}

I am loving my new Mac Book.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing design and built quality.\n-Awesum screen\n-Extremely good back-lit keyboard.\n\nCons:\n- A bit higher price tag (which is really worth).\n- Switching from Windows to Mac may take some time."}

Yeah, Apple products are expensive, but you get what you pay for.  I had to help my kids with their pc issues constantly, but on the macs....nothing....they just work.  The 13\" is a great size, not too heavy but with the solid aluminum body, it's strong.  I would advise getting something like Zagg Invisible shield for it as the aluminum finish does scratch easily.  Also, if you decide you want more memory and a bigger hard drive than the base model, buy it separately and not from apple.  Simply take out the bottom screws and pop in the RAM or the hard drive.  It's a piece of cake and will save you a bundle."}

The Air is my favorite for traveling since it is under 3lbs. The Pro however may be better suited for older kids with an included CD/DVD drive and burner. Since my nephews are young, I wanted small notebooks that could take a beating and they had to be 5 star quality but not too expensive. The Apple notebooks fit the requests and the nephews could not be more happier. If you are planning on a notebook in 2013 for your child, the majority of kids want Macs and with Apple making them affordable at $1100 each, the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air are the way to go."}

I bought this Mac book pro along with a new 27\" iMac & while they are still light years more reliable than a PC I have noticed a decline in the reliability of my Mac computers. The problem for me has been all with memory (ram) even with the ram maxed out on both computers I every once in a while have it lock up while editing photos (professional photographer) at first I thought aperture 3 was the problem, I switched over to Lightroom and there was a noticeable improvement but the problem remains. I have brought both in for service a number of times.\n\n- there was an issue with the seal on the monitor which caused dust to get under the screen\n- there was a problem with the screen refusing to wake from sleep mode\n\nEvery time apple handles the problem & fixes it for free. Apple products generally work out the small issues on their own, you only get problems when it's something big. Fortunately apples customer service is great.\n\nWhile I had my MacBook in for service I used my husbands HP laptop (similar specs) and there were many more quirks so overall I'm still happy with my purchase - apple still beats out windows/bios systems hands down but I would be lying if I said I wasn't concerned about the seemingly obvious decrease in quality over the years. I buy a new Mac every 2-3 years for work. With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best specs. I've never had a pc live longer than that. I choose to upgrade, I don't have to. My first PowerBook still\nWorks!"}

There is nothing wrong in Dell but I preferred Apple 13.4\" Display 500 GB Hard Drive, 4 GB memory and Intel Core i5 Processor (3rd gen).. This is best laptop.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Although there  is a small learning curve for Mac OS to get some hands on - but as I am familiar with Linux I am very comfortable with Mac OS... this is the only thing I see difficult with Mac Book .... and this is advantage in other sense coz you will be amazingly in a new world of OS and features...... and even if you are too restricted to MS Windows, you still can have partitions and Windows installed virtually or through boot camp... with all native speed...\n\n2. Macs never crash... I never see any application taking too much to respond and going nasty ....\nand same applications I saw going goofy on my other laptop which carries Windows with similar hardware.\n\n3. There are no issues at all with internet security and virus attacks... I don't even have any anti-virus ...\n\n4. If you are restricted to Word processing applications like MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, you can have MS Office on Mac just in $119... but if you are not restricted but still want this capability, Open-office can solve all your problems...\n\n5. You can make Mac virtually same as Windows if you are Microsoft fan.... I am also Microsoft fan and doing the same....\n\n6. Incredible display, laptop size and weight.... great battery backup...\n\n7. accept trusted content only e.g. tools, software etc.\n\n8. No other brand has touch pad like Mac .... you don't even need lot of keys from keyboard or mouse when you have MacBook touch pad with you\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Cost is more as compared to other brands. Other brands can come with higher configurations in same cost.... but Mac is Mac\n2. learning curve for OS and other features\n3. less free stuff compared to other communities... accept programs from trusted developers only"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I have been a PC user for most of my life. I used windows XP, windows Vista, and Windows 7 extensively. Most recently, I put Windows 8 on my old Dell laptop in an attempt to breathe new life into it. This plan ended when the hinge holding the screen on finally gave out. I purchased this computer from Amazon during the Black Friday sale, and got a much better deal than Apple was offering. Though the computer ships with Lion instead of the current Mountain Lion OS, the free upgrade that Amazon describes was processed and approved by Apple within about 10 minutes. The computer arrived very well packaged and in perfect condition.\n\nHardware: The Macbook pro's physical form is wonderful. Not only is it beautiful, but it feels really solid. Screen is bright and gorgeous. Trackpad is nothing short of dazzling when compared to competing Windows systems. Wake up time is very short. Sound from concealed speakers perfectly adequate for normal listening.\n\nSoftware: Though I was excited to try Mac, I was a little apprehensive. I have been a PC person for many years and feel really comfortable navigating Windows to accomplish tasks. Not only is Mac different, but Mac programs (in my experience) typically expect you to think in a slightly different way when trying to figure out how to do something new. I was a bit worried that I would experience some frustration. My fears, however, were unfounded. The system is amazingly intuitive, and, after a short learning curve, you begin to feel like Mac is a big improvement over Windows 7, and that Windows 8 is an unsuccessful attempt to recreate Mac successes. For example, I feel like the new Start screen is analogous to the Launchpad, but more cluttered and a bit clunky. Anyway, the transition is not difficult, and the experience trumps Windows easily.\n\nWHY THE MACBOOK PRO, WHY NOT THE AIR? I did consider purchasing the Air instead of the Pro. I was attracted to the all flash architecture of the air. Solid state drives don't wear out, even after 5+ years of operation. Also, lugging around a heavy computer just in case I need it is a peeve of mine, with the result that I often don't have my computer when I need it. The Pro is by no means a heavy computer, but the Air is remarkably light. I don't really believe I would have ever missed the optical drive, as I still have a desktop that I can use to burn CDs/DVDs and to store massive files that would overwhelm the relatively small solid state storage of the Air. Why, then, did I get the Pro? Longevity for one. I expect a laptop to last around 5 years at this point. While the base Pro and Air have similar performance ratings, in two years I can open the bottom of the Pro and easily and cheaply upgrade the RAM. I also plan to put in a solid state drive at that time. This can all be done more cheaply than paying Apple for the upgrade right now. Also, though I understand why it may be reasonable to make the Air without an Ethernet cable, my office at the university does not have Wifi. There are no plans to expand coverage to my office and I am not permitted to expand the network on my own. This means I am restricted to ethernet connection. I realize that there are USB and Thunderbolt adapters for this, but I would need to use this adapter literally every day. In the end, I don't think it would be worth the hassle. Also, some users report issues with getting the Air to use these adapters, a situation which would be extremely negative for my work situation even on a short-term basis. In the end, these reasons led me to get the Pro over the Air, and I am highly satisfied with my decision. The relatively greater mass of the Pro is not an issue, as the computer is still highly portable, and not having to mess with the ethernet adapter is a pro that I am already grateful for.\n\nOverall, my experience with this computer has been great. I would highly recommend the switch, and I will not be returning to the Windows platform for the foreseeable future."}

Considered MAcBook Air also before buying this Pro, but glad bought the Pro, because I didn't fancy carrying a bunch of adapters, separate DVD player etc.....\nHonestly didn't see too much difference visually between this screen and the retina display, so didn't fancy paying that much premium for retina, others may fancy that, I didn't.\nCompared other ultrabooks like Zenbook and the price were very comparable but none of them carry the reputation of Mac, so stuck with Macbook\nOnly thing I dislike is that everything for Mac is expensive but I guess you pay for quality!"}

I tried to recalibrate several times with no luck. A little research revealed others having similar issues. Apparently, Apple is using 3 different vendors to produce the panels, each having varying contrast/color IQs - aka the \"panel roulette.\"\n\nComparing this side-by-side with my 2011, 13\" Macbook Pro was like night and day. My 2011 has great contrast and is so easy on the eyes. This 2012 has marginally better contrast than my 2010 kindle, which is certainly not a good thing with a backlit screen.\n\nWhat annoys me the most is that Apple is losing a grip on QC. They claim to calibrate each screen individually; and they should considering the entrance fee for these books. No way this thing should have been let out of the factory.\n\nMy advice is to do a little research and consider purchasing in person to verify the contrast, color and quality of the screen you're purchasing."}

I have used this product for only 2 days, but I can't wait to use it more. I really like Mac/Apple products because of their operating system. I have been a Linux (Ubuntu and Fedora) user for a while because Windows doesn't appeal to me and it is similar to Ubuntu and Fedora but with trackpad gestures, notification center, and I can run iTunes (I couldn't get it to run on Linux). I can tweet and use Facebook from the sidebar which is really nice. I also like I have the option to push calendars, photos, and contacts to an iPad, iPod Touch, or iPhone (if I had any of those).The only thing I have had trouble with so far is transferring music to iTunes which I would have liked to do though \"Home Sharing\" (I used iTunes on a computer separate from my Linux computer) but I could not figure that out. I just ended up using my iPod to transfer my iTunes music and I re-downloaded my Amazon music (losing my ratings). I would recommend this product to anyone having trouble typing on their iOS products, though there are cheaper options; any new computer users, as it is easy to learn; and anyone who needs to be efficient, as the gestures make it very easy to multitask. I have not tried gaming on it but I have heard that Mac/Apple does not do games well. I plan on using my MacBook Pro for a long time."}

After all these years.\n\nWhy not the air?\nUnless you are between 2 and 4 years old, weight just isn't as big of an issue as people and Apple make it out to be. In the real world, performance is the bigger bang for the buck, especially if you install an SSD or hybrid drive in it. Oh, by the way, yes. You can upgrade it. want to upgrade an Air? Too bad. Tough nuts. No way. Sorry Charlie.\n\nI would rate the 13\" macbook pro as 4 star simply because of the integrated graphics card.

(Available from Amazon.)\n\nIncluded with this computer is iMovie 11, but NO WAY to make a DVD of your movie.\n\nAs compared to my previous MacBook, the changes are as follows:\n\n1)  The battery is no longer user replaceable. This means the computer has to be taken to the shop for repair.  This also means you probably will want remove all of your data from the hard drive for security reasons prior to servicing.  My previous MacBook allowed replacement of the internal battery in 10 seconds, with no tools.\n\n2)  OS 10.8 is definitely \"dumbed down\" as compared with 10.6.  10.8 now has \"Windows like\" hidden files (this can be disabled).\n\n3)  \"Bounce\" has been removed from the Apple Mail program.  \"Bounce\" is a great tool to let people know you don't want any further e-mails from them.  ( Third parties have a fix for this defect also.)\n\n4)  No installation disk (DVD) is included. This means that should you need to repair or rebuild your computer you are absolutely dependent on the existence and availability of Apple's servers.  You cannot repair your machine without Internet access.  Many experts advise creating your own installation disk (DVD) to make up for this mistake. I intend to do this.\n\n5)  No more \"Save As\".  This has been replaced with a more complicated \"duplicate\" feature. Less intuitive and a higher workload.\n\n6)  The default security settings intimidate you into thinking that downloading software from anywhere other than the Apple Store is less secure. This setting can be changed to take the computer out of \"nanny mode\".  I suspect in the future, Macs will become like iPhones so that only software from the Apple Store can be installed.\n\n6)  I like the lighted keyboard and the built-in DVD drive. I would never purchase a computer without an optical drive.\n\nThis computer is still superior to anything running Windows.  However, it is definitely a downgrade from previous MacBook models."}

Looking forward to affordable capable notebook docking stations built around thunderbolt for simplified home/office docking.\n\nAbout it not being a retina display: I Don't Care. Most of the time I use an external display. I also sit far enough away that I don't see individual dots anyway (internal or external screen.)

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I had never considered buying a Mac because of the high price. However, after having several other Apple devices over the years and enjoying the lack of errors and problems with the devices and the OS's, I gave it more consideration as I approached buying my very first laptop (after having over 20 years experience on desktop PC's).  I saved about $300 buying it on Amazon rather than elsewhere (no sales tax, big discount and $3.99 overnight shipping with Prime). The machine is brand new and it came installed with the Mountain Lion OS.\nThe screen is excellent, it boots up fast. USB 3.0 is very fast. The trackpad works far better than I had anticipated. The gestures are amazing. The OS is very different than Windows, but is not hard to navigate. I store my regular 'Work in Process' documents on Dropbox, so those were a cinch to pull over. I still have to migrate my pictures and music to the machine. All of my bookmarks in Safari that I created over the years on the iPad pulled over seamlessly. The integration with my other Apple products via iCloud is outstanding.\n\nEverything from the box, the instructions, initial setup, downloading and installing software, the navigation of the OS....it all has a consistent and polished look.  Before i bought this I felt like I was getting the 'low end' laptop from Apple. After using it for a few days I am in awe of the performance and design. The screen is the perfect size and everything pops on it. It is very thin and quiet! I haven't heard a fan yet. This is money well spent. Thanks!\n\nUpdate 1: I upgraded my RAM to 8 gigs and this laptop is blazing fast!!! I can't believe it had the impact that it does. If this machine continued to run just like it does now, I won't need to upgrade for years to come. I used the Crucial brand and recommended specs so I don't screw with the warranty."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I just bought this MacBook Pro a few weeks ago, and the user interface was so simple I got used to my computer in a matter of days, rather than the year it took for me to master Microsoft Windows 7. Boot time is super fast, around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute. Apps launch super fast, and the 500GB HDD is more than sufficient. I usually use my Mac for school work and internet browsing, so the entry-level 13\" MacBook Pro is already more than what I expected from a computer I would typically use it for. Macs hardly ever get viruses, and they are completely incompatible with existing Microsoft Windows Viruses. Furthermore, Mac OS X Mountain Lion's Gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans, which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed. The keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back-lit, which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing (Typing?). Overall, the screen resolution, though non-retina, is sufficient for normal web browsing and work. I still don't get why retina displays are standard on most new iOS devices, but are only available on the MacBook Pro with Retina Display (Total cheapskate!). The thunderbolt port is awesome! It's 10gbps transfer speeds surpass even the super-fast USB 3.0 (Which also comes with the MBP). US 3.0 comes with the MBP and has transfer rates of up to 5gbps. Other ports include FireWire 800, Gigabit Ethernet, MagSafe port, Microphone jack. SDHC card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs.\n\nThe glass track pad is large enough for Apple's highly acclaimed multi-touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers, zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers, accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers.\n\nYou can also buy one of Apple's magic mice, which connect to your Mac using Bluetooth, and also allows you to use certain multi-touch gestures such as zoom and scroll.\n\nFor Windows users switching to a Mac, you can also enable right clicking (known to apple as secondary click) in the system preferences> Mouse and enabling right clicking.\n\nThe unique to apple aluminium uni-body is a real beauty. It makes the MBP very durable and protects it from scratches, though you shouldn't go launching it against a wall for the sake of trying it.\n\nFor Windows users who are used to using Microsoft Office, you can buy a license for the latest Microsoft Office software for Mac (Currently 2011) at any of apple's retail stores, Apple Authorised resellers, any store that sells Microsoft Office for Mac or downloading the software directly from Microsoft's website.\n\n*Users without an optical drive can skip the installation of Microsoft Office and head to the next section*\nTo install the software, simply insert the disc provided in the package into the optical drive and open and install all the files.\nEnter your code printed on the back of your CD sleeve when prompted.\nDone! Enjoy using Microsoft Office!\n\n*For those without an optical drive (MBP with Retina Display and MB air), read this. Users with and optical drive can skip this section*\nTo download Microsoft Office, go to Microsoft's website and download the trial version. When prompted, enter your code printed on the back of your CD sleeve to unlock the full potential of Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac.\n\nThe Mac app store and iTunes store are phenomenal. The Mac app store is your one-stop shop for Mac software, though you can also download software online at your own risk. There are currently around 10,000 apps on the App store (and counting...), and billions of songs available for download fro the iTunes store. iTunes is also you default (And also your only) media player besides DVD player, or any other media players you may come across on the internet. iTunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it's simple to use User Interface. Users switching from a PC will definitely prefer iTunes to Microsoft's Windows media player.\n\nOverall, the high price of the MacBook Pro may convince users to buy a cheaper Windows PC instead. But remember, you are paying a high premium for a product with better build quality and high quality software, which is a joy to work with, considering that you can finally work in peace without having to worry about the millions of Windows viruses out in the wild attacking countless careless and oblivious PC users. I'm sure you won't regret making this purchase."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "My previous Macbook was a 2011 Air, also 13\".\nI bought the base model as I was to upgrade the RAM and HDD myself, and the processor upgrade wasn't worth it to me.\n\nInitial thoughts:\n- Boot-up is much slower than my last Macbook Air because of the HDD instead of an SSD\n- Screen does look better even tho it has a lower resolution\n- Keyboard is a tad stiffer than Macbook Air\n- Hearing the DVD drive spin up every boot-up is strange, but not annoying\n- Much better graphics and processor performance\n- Thickness or weight doesn't bother me, since I use it as my main computer\n- Mic is above the 'esc' key and not next to the fan vent like the Macbook Air\n- Runs much cooler and quieter\n- USB slots are next to each other instead of one on each side\n- Upgraded to 8gb ram(http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Y4XAAK/ref=pe_175190_21431760_M3T1_SC_dp_1) shortly after\n\nMore Detail:\n- Boot-up takes around 45 seconds compared to my Macbook Air taking around 15 seconds.  Applications also start slower, instead of almost all my apps opening instantly, it takes 2-3 seconds.  An easy fix to that will be an SSD which I should be getting November sometime and will update this with comparisons.\n- I compared my roommate's 2011 Macbook Pro 13\" to my 2011 Macbook Air 13\" before I sold it.  His looked much better, darker blacks, more saturated and warm.  My Air looked stale and not as detailed as his Pro. The resolution is only 1280x800 compared to the 1440x900 of the Macbook Air, but I kind of like that better because text is bigger and I don't have to squint as much(not that I did that much before).\n- The first time I typed my name and password for the Pro I noticed the keyboard is slightly stiffer. I can say I liked the Macbook Air's keyboard better, but not a lot to be bothered by it.  Having used it for a month now, I don't even notice it anymore.\n- Having no DVD drive for almost a year was amazing, but frustrating the few times when I needed it. The noise isn't loud when turning on the computer, shouldn't be enough to wake someone up in the same room that is sleeping. Now I can't move my Mac around as fast since it has more moving parts in it, but thats not a big deal for me.\n- Graphics are much improved.  The comparison Apple gives is 60% improvement over the previous generation, however I went from a 2011 Macbook Air to a 2012 Macbook Pro. I'm not sure if thats more than a 60% improvement as I don't have a 2012 Macbook Air to compare.  Lets just say with my Macbook Air I had to have the lowest settings on Starcraft 2 to play a 3v3 game online and it would still lag later on and dip below 20fps.  WIth my Macbook Pro I can have medium settings on a 3v3 and have a steady 50fps the whole game.  The only time I could have a steady 50fps on high settings was a 1v1 game. However, medium settings look 10x better than low(mainly from shaders), while high settings looks only 2x better than medium.  Other games like Portal 2, Left 4 Dead 2, Torchlight 2(Windows Boot Camp), League of Legends, Half LIfe 2 series, CS:GO, TF2 I could get almost the highest settings(usually excluding AA) and be smooth.  Converting video via Handbrake was also quicker on the Macbook Pro, I don't have a video for proof, but from what I remember it was at least 2x as fast.\n- I used my Macbook Air for everything including school, work, games, video, music, etc. So it was on my desk 90% of the time.  So naturally moving to a thicker and slightly heavier Macbook Pro had no affect on me.  Even when I use it on my lap while watching TV or helping someone on the XBOX with a game, it doesn't feel like a brick.\n- My biggest complaint on the Macbook Air was the placement of the mic.  It was right next to the exhaust vent, so when I was playing any game online and using Skype, the other person could hear the fan blasting at a full 6500 rpm.  The mic on the Macbook Pro is now above the 'esc' key and not right next to the fan, much better design decision.  I've played games online and people don't hear the fans anymore.\n- As I mentioned before, while playing a game on the Macbook Air the fans would climb to 6500 rpm fast and be very loud and quite hot to the touch in the upper left corner of the laptop.  The highest I've seen it on my Macbook Pro is 5300 rpm, and it doesn't always do that.  Strangely enough it would do that on Starcraft 2 then would dip down to about 3000 rpm during a game and I couldn't hear it anymore. So noise is reduced at least 50% and the heat is much better, now it doesn't feel hot but warm.\n- The USB ports are right next to each other on the left side which is fine by me since my laptop is on the left side of my desk, so everything is out of the way for me.  On my Macbook Air cords would come out of both directions and cause a mess sometimes.  Even if it was the same as the Macbook Air, wouldn't bother me much.  Just be sure to have a USB drive that isn't super thick or you can't fit another next to it.\n- I was restricted to 4gb of ram on the Macbook Air which I thought would be fine before purchasing.  However I was new to Macs and didn't know that OSX uses a lot more ram than Windows, which is fine because its a lot more responsive, I just wish I had known before hand.  For me, after booting up with no apps open it was taking around 2gb or half the ram already.  Windows used around 500mb-750mb with no apps open.  So if I were playing a game, I couldn't have any other programs open or it would run slower.  I also had to keep track on how many tabs I had open in Chrome or Safari, especially if they had flash content like Youtube.  With 8gb of ram I can have Safari running with several tabs, Mail, Spotify, Preview, Textedit, and Steam open while playing Starcraft 2 and it doesn't slow down at all.\n- Another random note to mention is the screen bezel is black and not white. I kind of like the black better, especially when playing a game or watching video when the screen is darker.\n\nOverall I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and can't wait to get a 256gb SSD and watch this thing fly.\nThat is really the only thing I miss from my last Macbook Air.\nWill edit my post when I get an SSD and if I find other things I forgot to mention.\n\nHope this review was informative!"}

I have to say the computer wasn't too bad before the additions. Boot up time was about 35 seconds and the programs were loaded fairly quick. The only drawback is that it became a little warm but not nearly as bad as how others described it. After replacing the stock hdd with a samsung 830 ssd 256gb and 8gb corsair ram, the computer is lighting fast and the temp stays pretty cool. Im very happy with the trackpad and the solid aluminum build. I feel like it was worth the extra few bucks."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "First let me say this Mac was a gift. Second let me say not really.\nI hate it so much I wouldn't even give it to you if I hated you.\nFirst I wiped this device and installed a clean version. Then I updated. You know the low cost updates Apple puts out. Seriously I had to leave it running overnight on the update.\nIt has been nothing but problems. Every update breaks something and not I am not kidding. Mostly they break their own tools or apps.\nI updated the software on a clean install, then update iTunes, cool yeah. Wrong.  iTunes needs quicktime version blah blah error starts popping up. Only that version is installed and I'm not using iTunes.\nThen I update the OS to the newest version only to see its killed Cisco VPN permanently. I don't mean the client I mean it removed the parameters in networking to allow connections. And it broke the web version of Cisco Anyconnect which you have to buy and its not cheap. My Apple support friends at Boeing have asked me how I fixed it. I look on websites forApple and they are dumber than crowbars so I happen to see a 64 bit mentioned and I decide to search for a Cisco 64 bit client and install it. Works again only I am running 32bit OSX nice. Then I try to update again to the best yet from Apple low and behold I'm told to buy it from the store. Only I have to have the newer version to download from the store. Apple intellect at its best. After a phone call and some money I have a cd on the way.  I install the next version, setup a printer, setup office, configure email, and install a couple other items nothing major though.\nInstalled updates 1GB worth and bam the printer is dead. Of course on windows you can delete, or change/view the network settings, and reinstall in a minute. On a mac you need another 1.5 GB install. The cool thing is how you download the installer and it expands it and moves the files to various other locations. Sheer genius to take a download file, extract it to a .pkg file, then scatter files all over the hard drive so you cant possibly just go back to the download location to reinstall.  Now I suppose their is some script I could run but I can't even find the install using Apple guidelines from the OS. Not even using the help from from forums.\nAnyone that says a mac is easy is lying. Every update you run the prospect of losing hardware settings, programs you bought may no longer work, and you might even have a paper weight.\nThe issues I have had are not hardware problems. I installed another harddrive, installed Windows XP and no issues, wiped it and installed windows 7 and both were faster and more stable.\nIf all your going to do is browse the web and use iTunes you might be okay other than that they are junk. I have built a non standard Windows 2008 server on a Dell desktop and had to hack network card drivers and it runs fine, wiped a virus off a kids pc, did a complete reinstall of Vista without drivers on an older pc and spent less time than on this mac. I have had it two months and its been used about 12 times,  I have ins talled windows XP\\windows 3.1\\95\\95\\windows 7 and updated thousands of times and even the worst pc I have had, has never given me this much grief. This is the reason MS sold 60 million copies of XP, over 60 million copies of Windows 7 and Apple has sold 3 million mountain lion operating systems. And Apple charges $15 and Windows charges between $100-$300 per copy.\nIf you buy a new computer every 3-6 months Apple is for you. The first couple updates will render it a paper weight and then you can get a new one and they will give you an $8 trade in credit too! As for the folks at the store helping you I would say yes they will if you forgot how to plug it in. If it involves tech support you better hope you have some good diagnostic skills. I usedto think I did before I got this mac.\nI got this laptop for troubleshooting and to become familiar so I could assist others. It has taken more research than my degree and let me tell you it certainly has help me learn how to troubleshoot macs. Now I know why few vendors make software for macs. It's not because Mac doesn't license them its because of poor/incomplete development at Apple."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I'll start by saying this is about my fourth or fifth MBP I've owned.  The ones before it worked flawlessly.  I thought I was \"upgrading\" to this machine but I was WRONG.  Boy was I wrong.  The changes that came along with Mountain Lion are downright horrific to the point that I'm ready to throw this thing against the wall.  I am SO frustrated with this messy, imprecise, unpredictable user experience!  So what sucks about it?\n\n--Now when you scroll on a webpage more than two or three times, the page will begin scrolling EXTREMELY fast causing you to lose your place and have to backtrack to try and find it.  Scroll a couple more times and it happens AGAIN.  This is f'ing maddening.  What's even more maddening is that this has been forced upon us with no option to turn it off!  I've called Applecare about it multiple times now and I'm told it's a \"design feature.\"  WELL IT SUCKS!  Supposedly it's to mimic how an iPhone works?  I don't know, as I don't own an iPhone--but I do know one thing!  I DON'T WANT MY LAPTOP ACTING LIKE A F'ING IPHONE!!!\n\n--Rubber-banding effect on webpages.  This is where the webpage (or folder, etc) will stretch beyond its boundaries and then \"snap back.\"  Now this wouldn't be a big deal if the rubber-banding only occurred on the tops and bottoms of webpages, but Apple has also decided to implement it on the SIDES of webpages.  This causes webpages to slip and slide all over the f'ing place, making it extremely annoying when trying to read text while scrolling!  Again, no way to turn this \"design feature\" off!\n\n--Apple has also decided to change all the trackpad gestures, and not for the better.  AGAIN!!!!  No ability to revert them back to what they were in Snow Leopard.  Seriously--how hard would it be for Apple to simple offer an option to use the older, more familiar settings for these sorts of things?  I did manage to set my frontward/backward webpage settings to three-finger swipe like I'm accustomed to from SL.  Cool!  Ummm, too bad it barely works!  Half the time the trackpad is completely unresponsive when using this gesture.  How.  F'ing.  Obnoxious.\n\nI am racking my brain trying to figure out a way to get RID of this thing and go back to an older MBP running Snow Leopard (which was NEVER broken so I'm not sure why Apple went and tried to fix it!)  Unfortunately if I return it, I'll be slapped with hefty a restocking fee.  And I don't have the conscience to pawn this hunk of junk off on someone else.  I have never in my life regretted an \"upgrade\" like I have with this purchase.  I have learned the hard way: Newer does NOT always mean better!!!  If I wanted a frustrating user experience I would have simply purchased a $279 Toshiba running Windows!!!  I will not rest until I get rid of this computer or Apple fixes their annoying \"design features\" which do nothing but infuriate me and many others!"}

Windows allows more \"tweaking\" but the Mac was just plain fun to use.\n\nThe display's resolution isn't the best. However......... Actually, I'm not going into ANY details on the pros as you can probably see from all the other reviews.\n\n***************************\nI want to mention a few cosmetic caveats:\n\nThe aluminum: VERY beautiful but also VERY prone to damage. Try not to get too much sweat on the aluminum, as it will cause these black specks to appear that cannot be erased. I recommend getting a palmguard as well as an outer case/ skin.\n\nKeyboard: the material of the keycaps WILL wear out.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "I bought my MacBook Pro 13\" two weeks and I'm amazed by how good this machine is. I was having a though time deciding between the 13\" MacBook Air or the MacBook Pro 13\" (Both baseline models, priced at 1,200 $ retail) I went for the MacBook pro because I needed lots of storage and 128gb on the MacBook Air are just not enough for me and even if I had bought the MacBook Air it would had defeated the purpose of the Air since it wouldn't be so \"portable\" if I had to take an external Hard drive everywhere with me.\n\n  So... Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n\nSpeed: This MacBook pro is fast, really fast, it boots up in around 30 seconds, apps open quickly and the MacBook doesn't lag when it comes to video editing, and Photoshop also runs decently.\n\n Design: The computer has a great design, its not that thick, it has all the necessary ports, even a battery indicator which I think is awesome, it also has USB 3 which is really nice and fast\n\nKeyboard: The keyboard is amazing, the keys are sensitive and it feels amazing to type on them, the keyboard is backlit, which is perfect for typing in low lights situations.\n\nTrackpad: The glass trackpad is really nice, its big, the entire trackpad is a button and the gestures are really nice. Simply the best trackpad I've used.\n\nBattery: Battery life is pretty good, I get around 5-6 hours doing normal tasks.\n\nOS X: This is my first mac and I'm impressed by OS X Mountain Lion, it comes with no 3th party software, it comes with all the apps you need + the Mac App Store is great for finding new apps. The OS is fast and fluid, everything is organized and it's just beautiful. I'm coming from Windows 7 and the switch was quite easy for me.\n\nCons:\n\nScreen: I think 1280-by-800 is quite low for a computer this expensive and that its claimed to be a professional notebook, even the 13\" MacBook air has a better display. Don't get me wrong, the display is not that bad looking, in fact its quite good, but for something this expensive it will be nice if it came with a better screen.\n\nOverall this is a great computer, its fast, has a great design, big storage (Even though it's a bit slow, but I'm planning on upgrading to a SSD soon) and awesome battery life. I will recommend this MacBook to anyone looking for a good portable notebook.\n\nOne more thing, Windows users don't let OS X stop you from switching, the first days it's a bit hard to get used to it but after you will love Mountain Lion, and if you need any specific windows application that won't run in OS X there's plenty of ways of getting Windows 7 in a Macintosh"}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "The Macbook Pro is the premier choice for college students. First off, I would say that 75-85% of the Mac's on my campus are Pro's, rather than the Air version.\n\nWhy?\nWeight isn't as big of an issue as they make it out to be.\n\nPerformance is much much better on the Pro, especially if you install an SSD on it. (150$ish)\n\nThe Bad\nI would rate the mac as a 4 star simply because not all the software I need is available to Mac's. Purchasing Parellels to run Windows fixes the problem, but that's just another added cost to the already high price. Also, it is a pain to sync up a Droid phone because Mountain Lion isn't compatible with the Droid software yet.\n\nThe Good\nThe good news is the resale value is so high. You can spend $1,300 on a mac, and 3 years later still get 700+. A windows version will set you back $800 or so, and constantly have to be updated, and the value after 3 years will be 300$ if your lucky. This means a great deal to me as a college student, because I want something that will last a few years, but one that will also have a high resale value. Apple software in general is much easier to use than Windows also, so it is more user friendly.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend Mac's to college students.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "This is my very first Mac and I made the switch from years of using Windows. I had been wanting a MacBook for three years before I actually had enough money to purchase one. I am a college freshman and I bought my MacBook Pro mainly for school and so far I am loving it! The screen is nice and very clean. The downside to the screen, however, is you can't see in direct sunlight (which is a problem for someone like me who likes to sit outside and do work on the plaza at my school) and it is a magnet for dust and lint. The laptop is very lightweight and portable; I rarely even notice it's in my backpack! The keys are very well lit and comfortable to type on and you don't hear the annoying click-clack that most keyboards make (a plus for someone like me who enjoys the quiet). The sound is nice and loud; I don't have any problems with hearing anything. One of my favorite things about it is that you can't hear it running. I've had this laptop for only a week now but I've had it running pretty hard with all apps open and it'll just get hot, but you can't hear the fan or computer running. This is perfect for when I'm in class taking notes because I don't get distracted or annoy others by the computer being loud and disruptive. I only have two complaints: 1) the laptop heats up pretty fast but it doesn't burn your leg or anything and 2) the battery indicator is very indecisive, meaning that the \"Calculated Time Remaining...\" isn't too accurate and it'll show only 4 hours left after I've completed a full charge and have my keyboard lights off and my screen at half brightness. Despite the battery life indicator, the laptop (at half screen brightness and half or less keyboard brightness) gets well over 8 hours of battery life, as advertised by Apple, which is PERFECT for me. I don't think a Mac is worth the $1000 but I do not regret spending it on this laptop one bit! Thank you, Apple, for creating a computer I can actually deal with!"}

If you've used an iPhone (or any touch screen device) you can use a mac's track pad no problem. I used to hate using track pads on PC's because they were always so small, I don't mind using the mac's track pad but would consider buying the magic mouse just because I'd rather use a mouse and the glass touch pad makes me nervous, I'm halfway afraid I'll break it. At the apple store I had the guy change the track pad so you don't have to click it, I can just tap it to open an app. The graphics are pretty good for someone who doesn't game a lot, if you're used to a lower end PC's graphics you'll be impressed by these graphics, although before I bought the mac I had a netbook and I was impressed by it's graphics too. If you haven't played with a mac in person, be sure to check one out somewhere if graphics are your tipping point. The screen is really nice, very clear and bright. The mac installed Microsoft office for mac with no problems. The only thing I would say that I don't like about the mac is that you cannot download more than one app at a time and it takes forever to download apps. I had to install Mountain Lion and it took a good two hours. I've noticed that if you close your open windows the app download time is less. The mac does get hot when it's charging, and when it's not it's still pretty hot (and I mean hot not warm.) Be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it. I have a fan blowing toward mine and it's been cool all morning even with the charger in. If you're going to let a little one play with it make sure you set it on a desk so it doesn't heat up your baby's lap. I've read that the mac becomes cooler as it gets more broken in, but I have no proof of that yet.\n I would recommend to a friend if they can afford it, if not an iPad or an iPod touch really isn't too far off. Also if you're a netbook user like I was the macbook will seem kind of heavy, but I'm sure after carrying it to and from your destinations (school, work) it will seem lighter.  One more thing, this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC's, also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables. In my experience with the iPhone, the charging cable became very frayed and I could see the wires and aluminum in the cord. WIth a seven hour battery life I would recommend keeping the charger in one spot at home and making sure your battery is full before you leave home, or buy a second cable for use at work or school. Maybe that will save the life of the cord and keep it from being frayed from too much movement. This mac does come with an extender cable and I'm using mine right now hoping the cable will stay nice for the many years I plan on using this mac. The part where the charger connects to a mac is a magnet and a strong one at that, be sure to keep your credit cards and cell phones away from it so it doesn't erase the data. I did read that in the fine print of the mac booklet. I might have read it incorrectly, but better safe than sorry right?\nHope this helps!\nP.S. the camera DOES NOT look hot it does on TV! It's very pixely, I don't know if you can change the quality of the camera, BUT just a heads up. It may be because the room I use it in has poor lighting, but it could also be that the camera just isn't that good. What you see on TV is probably pre-recorded using a real camera. I didn't buy the mac for it's camera or FaceTime or any of that so it's not a deal breaker for me, but it could be for someone else."}

Still, at nearly a grand after taxes, the cost was pretty steep when BB had PCs with similar or better specs for half the price.\n\nSo, why stick with this? I want to find out for myself if this is worth the price and the hype.  I already knew that Apple's customer service is great, and that alone is worth maybe $150. I do very little on my comp - read the news, write some papers, watch a movie, play chess at Yahoo!, so I do not need it to be a power machine, I simply need it to work. And it does, very well, in fact. Processes are seamless -There is great integration of things like the email client, the Apple store, and iTunes - of which I have NEVER been a fan. I avoid iTunes on my iPhone at all cost - I use Media Monkey instead - But I can see how valuable it is on the notebook. I love how even the websites  and files can be viewed in cover flow.  Apple thinks of \"little\" but important things like using a charger that is magnetically help in place, so that if you trip on the wire, it disconnects, instead of sending your expensive computer crashing to the floor.  And the fact that I can dual boot was a big selling point, if only so that I do not have to spend $100 to get Microsoft Word, which I will need once I start school again in a few weeks.\n\nI have had my MacBook for exactly two weeks, and  I do enjoy it when I can use it, but I have not yet decided if I will keep it. This is because the thing gets so unbearably hot, that it becomes too uncomfortable to use. My first day with this, I set it up, started playing chess through the included app -I was not even online - and within ten minutes, I thought the machine would burn a hole in my pants! I turned it off and ran to my desktop to do some research. And wow - what did I find!\n\nYeah - yeah - I get that Apple says the MacBook should not be used on laps- I get that I should go into Activity Monitor and quit programs that have high CPU - which are NONE - as I am doing very little on the thing in the first place. Yeah - I get that all of the Apple fans out there have this way and that way - some of it costing extra money - to try to help make my computing experience on the MB a more enjoyable one. But this is an experience I should have right out of the box! What other company makes a computer at this price that you cannot use for ten minutes without fearing you will suffer a burn? Now, before the fans come out and say, \"Take it back, yours is defective,\" I will remind you that this problem has been documented all over the Internet. I do not want to hear I should update to Mountain Lion. I have already done the research, and  some are complaining that their MacBook is running even hotter after the update. A co-worker of mine told me that he had a student bring a MacBook to him that had a battery so swollen that the chassis had separated by about 4 inches. Then I thought back to my own iPhone, which had to be replaced in January because of the same expanding battery issue; it split my phone's casing right down the back!\n\nHow Apple sells these products (with consistent-enough overheating and battery problems) and gets the accolades they do is beyond me. Maybe it is because, other than these very serious flaws, they pioneer very good and exciting technology. You have the fans who will accept any ole shortcoming to remain loyal to what they think is a superior product. Then perhaps there are others who are in my situation, who for the most part really enjoy this MacBook and would love to spend more time learning and using it, but who experience discomfort in just trying to use it for basic computer tasks. This puts me on the fence, as I try to find solutions that do not require my having to dip into my pocket any more to use a computer that simply should not run this hot, especially at this price!\n\n If you do not mind the heat and/or are dedicated to spending more money to cool the MacBook, I say go for it.  Even if you are not, but you have been thinking of taking the Apple plunge, I say try the MacBook out for yourself so that you can come to your own conclusion about the overall quality and worthiness of  the MacBook.  As for me, I remain hopeful and very disappointed at the same time.  I soon have to make a decision about returning it, but I have to admit that I really like this machine so much now that the cost bothers me less and less everyday, but that heat... that is a whole different story!\n\nUPDATE -\n\n10/29/12\n\nAfter taking the comp in and meeting with the folks at Apple, the heating problem has simply resolved itself.  As someone on the Apple forums suggested it would, it just stopped heating up so much and so quickly.  For two months I have used the Mac - and for the most part have liked it.  However, it certainly is not worth this much money, not my money!  The novelty and mystique of the great Mac Book has worn off!\n\nThere is just too much clicking I have to do to for basic functions like  minimizing a screen and finding files.  What takes 1 click on a Windows computer takes 2 on the Mac Book, what takes 2 on a Windows machine takes 3 on the Mac Book.  Sorry, but it DOES crash, and it crashes as much as any Windows machine I have ever used.  I do not like being forced to use iTunes.  If I had known beforehand that I could not download and use Media Monkey on this, I would not have bought this laptop.  I should be able to decide on the media management software that I want to use.  iTunes is not even very intuitive; rip a CD that is a compilation, and iTunes will not even rip it as ONE CD, rather as a different CD per different artist, and then you have to go in and correct all of the tags so iTunes can properly catalogue your music in its library, and then you have to tell the program to go back and find album art?  Who has time for this? Freeware is a whole lot easier and enjoyable to use, and allows you to use MY music the way I want to!  The Mac Book has stopped being fun for me, and I do not see what it has/does so much more/better than a PC to justify paying twice the price for half the specs of a Windows machine.\n\nI have not yet decided if I will sell it; this will be determined by how much I end up paying for a Windows laptop.  With Black Friday coming up, I should be able to get a good price, but if I end up paying more than $500, I will sell the Mac Book.  Never thought I would say that I am looking forward to buying a Windows machine, but Windows 8 is very enticing, at the moment.  The very good thing is that Apple products have great resale value, and my machine is only a few months old and is great cosmetic condition, as well as I have the latest Windows suite installed on it, so I should get a good price for it, if I do sell it."}

I was considering buying the Air, but in reality, this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient, even though it's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier. I'm not sure if it was covered in the description, but it does have a backlit keyboard and I'm getting about an 8 hour battery life on one charge (Except I don't use this for games or videos, which obviously would drain the battery faster). It wakes in less than a second when I open the lid. The screen has an extremely high resolution that I'm very pleased with. Even though MacBooks are expensive, you will see that they are well worth the money. I have only used PCs in the past, and it's easy to see that Apple is just more advanced. You will not regret buying this computer!"}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0074703CM", "review": "After owning my MacBook for a month I finally feel ready to review it accurately. Let me start off by saying that I was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop. I've always been a Windows guy so I've known that you can buy laptops with equivalent specs to Macs for a good deal cheaper. Though after comparing different laptops I was not able to find one that had  a satisfactory build quality. The closest I could find were laptops made by Asus, but even then I read of too many build quality issues that made me uneasy. Ultrabooks made by other companies had good quality, but by then they cost just as much as the MacBook but with lower specs.  So I decided to take the plunge with this MacBook after demoing it in a Apple Store. Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase:\n\nBuild Quality - Seriously, you can't beat a unibody construction. While other laptops creak when you pick them up due to the various plastic components screwed together, the Macbook feels firm. The only thing that initially concerned me was that the lid would slightly creak when you closed it. Running waxed dental floss through the hinges solved this.\n\nTrackpad and Keyboard- This extra large trackpad is heavenly to use. Having the whole trackpad function as a giant button is a lot more comfortable to use. Plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive. The keyboard keys are well spaced and the led backlighting is very cool.\n\nPower System - I regularly get around 6 hours from the battery, which I am more than satisfied with. The magsafe plugin system is more handy than I thought it would be, and there is a neat led battery indicator on the side of the notebook that makes checking the battery level with the computer off easy.\n\nOS X - Mine initially came with Lion, but after upgrading to Mountain Lion I am even more satisfied. Everything runs fast and animations are fluid. I love the multi touch features, which again is something I initially didn't think I would really need. It took me a little time to get used to using finder after being accustomed to windows explorer, but I am confident now in my ability to navigate through files just as quickly as in Windows.\n\nDual Booting - I have a few engineering programs that only run on Windows so I decided to install Windows 7 through bootcamp.  Because it boots natively from the hard drive, it runs just as smoothly as any other Windows laptop. Remember folks, this computer doesn't have any magical internal components. The Intel Chipset is the same used in any other laptop and thus Windows runs just the same with the proper drivers installed.\n\nChipset - The Intel Core i5 runs very fast with minimal heat. The Intel Graphics 4000 is more than adequate for most applications.\nI could even run Portal 2 on maximum graphics settings and play 1080p video without it breaking a sweat. The fan almost never revs up to an audible level. This is in part to the aluminum body being a giant heat sink. So yes, the laptop body can get warm at times. But it is never uncomfortably warm when I use it on my lap. Ill probably upgrade the RAM and the harddrive to an SSD in the future, but for now they are fine.\n\nSo all in all I am very happy with my purchase. I am officially a Mac convert and will use this laptop for a very long time.\n\nAlso, all the Windows \"gamers\" who are trashing Macs need to gain some perspective. Yes, I can get a Core i7 laptop with a dedicated graphics card for a lot cheaper than the MacBook. But I decided to spend the extra money to get a better engineered laptop with some nifty extra features."}

This time I wanted to go for Apple product and started my search in that direction. After going through a number of online shopping sites I came to a conclusion that Amazon is the best as I am quite familiar with their services. The Apple MacBook Pro was delivered on time. My wife is very pleased with the gift. As I was probing through the MacBook Pro I came to know that it has some superior features that I don't find on my laptop.\n\nThe most amazing feature is that the Thunderbolt OS allows data transfer at the rate of 10GBps. The design is outstanding. I was glad to notice that it came with 7 hours of battery life. Though this is the first time I am trying a Mac OS I did not find anything unusual."}

Added an iMac about 2 years later. Then, switched back to primarily PC for work on a HP Envy 14. I also took some time to build a sweet gaming PC rig. And now, after selling the iMac (not really used since college), the gaming PC and the HP Envy 14, I have hopped back onto this MacBook Pro 13 inch.\n\nI'm very glad to be back on an Apple product. Having used PCs exclusively for the last 2 years, I can identify a few specific reasons why I wanted to get back to Mac.\n\n1) Mouse mechanics - there is really nothing in the PC market that compares to the Mac trackpad. The closest alternative to its smooth, accurate and conveniently place functionality is the Lenovo ThinkPad's red nipple. Since I work often where having to pull out a separate mouse would be inconvenient, this was an important point for me.\n\n2) Battery life - even new, the HP Envy only hits 3 hours or so on a full charge. I can squeeze close to 6 hours out of the MBP. Trips on the road make the doubled battery life very useful.\n\n3) Lion productivity features - I remember having to use a second monitor on my PC setups just for the real estate. i can honestly say that I am fine without that now when able to swipe between desktops with 3 finger motions on this trackpad. Having a second monitor anyway is a bonus now that lets me just keep iTunes or Outlook open on the side.\n\n4) Speed - Lion and the upgrades I've added to this MBP (listed above) have made this computer incredibly fast. I can crunch through 500,000 row Excel spreadsheets, update my iPhone firmware, and watch a 720p YouTube without any noticeable hitches. Startup takes less than 10 seconds, waking from start is instantaneous (so awesome and useful!), install speeds are zippy.\n\n5) Prettiness - beautiful work machines can inspire better and more creative work. It does more than just make me want to use the MBP more - it's a constant reminder of how careful planning, bold design choices, good engineering, and hard work make inspirational products.\n\nClearly I'm a fan. Still, I'm going to deduct a star for three reasons:\n\n1) Price - it's expensive for the components inside. The price essentially values the Lion OS X and integrated software/hardware at something like $200 over similar Windows systems.\n\n2) Fragile aesthetics - the aluminum frame scratches a little too easily and the glossy screen picks up fingerprints/oil. I'm babying the hell out of this MBP, which means taking off my aircraft aluminum watch before using it and wiping its screen down about once every other day.\n\n3) Glossy screen - screen glare makes working in sunlight basically impossible."}

That should make this computer worthy of 5 stars.\n\nThe ssd and extra ram are an option if you order directly from apple, but your definitely going to pay for it.  I think it was around 16 hundred bucks last I checked.  (It never hurts to check your options).\n\nIf you ask me for almost $1200.00 an ssd and at least 8gb ram should have been included, but whatever, everybody wants more $$$.\n\nOverall I'm happy, but I'll definitely be happier when I upgrade to the ssd and more ram.  It's a solid laptop, and the aluminum body at least makes you feel like you've got something for your money as opposed to a plastic shell.  And I don't feel like I'm going to snap it in half on accident like the macbook air.\n\nI'm also thinking of taking out the optical drive while I'm putting in the new ssd.  I watched some video's it's not rocket science so if your comfortable with electronics you shouldn't have a problem.  This should make it a little lighter, but may void your warrenty (but not forever apparently).  If you need to get it serviced the guys at apple just told me to pop back in the optical drive before I get it serviced.  They definitely have good customer service, so that is always a plus.\n\nThey said changing the ssd and ram doesn't affect the warranty at all so if your sketchy about removing the optical drive you can at least upgrade to the ssd and upgrade the ram and not affect your warranty.  Hope this helps if you have been looking at macs for a while like I was.  Read other reviews, but more importantly actually visit an apple store and play with the different laptops if you can.  That will help you decide more than anything.  Good luck!"}
