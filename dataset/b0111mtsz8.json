{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "There's way to much to go over but to sum it up it's a great PC for it's price range (in my opinion) but as you use it and start to see it's limits you also start to see why it's only $500 and not $1000 or higher. A few complaints I want you to know that I have that you may have are the light's they are annoying especially during the night because the keyboard stays on and the mouse stays glowing off and on when the computers on and sometimes in early stand by stages. The next is the noise it makes when it turns on and when the CPU is being pushed or used extensively. Well it actually makes constant noise regardless of what your doing but at those times it gets worse. The last is not to long after I got it the CPU fan broke and my computer would overheat without it but I called CyberpowerPC and they resovled my issue even though it took half an hour or longer. After the call I got my new FREE CPU fan in like 3 to 5 days."}
{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "I purchased my computer in October of 2016, and for these last few months it's performed stunningly and ran most any game smoothly with little to no trouble, however I'm disappointed to find out that only 6 months later my cooling fan is already going out. Games that would usually run without any effort were now overheating my computer and causing it to shut down, and to be honest I don't really game heavy. I contacted customer support, and the assistant was quite nice and instructed me to first attempt cleaning any dust from the fans and inside of my PC as they can cause overheating and if it didn't improve things to contact them again. I'd asked a more computer savvy friend after this didn't work (while the fan did run quieter after the dusting) and he announced that unfortunately my fan was going out. I'm very bummed out that things would start breaking down only 6 months in, I had been very satisfied otherwise. My satisfaction from here in will depend on how their customer service plans on handling the problem when I contact them in the morning. Until then my rating stands at 3 but I will update my review once I've spoken to them.\n\n** Update 1: After 55 minutes in queue on the phone I finally was able to speak to a customer service rep who was nice and helpful enough though not quite enough to make up for the ridiculous amount of time spent trying to get a hold of him. Either way, he was quick to help me order a new fan for arrival in 4-5 business days. I don't want to say the customer service was poor because the rep himself was quite helpful, but either they were stacked with calls or he was the only one in the office because almost an hour of wait time for the 3 minutes of actual talking to a rep is insane.\n\n**Update 2: So, it's been about two weeks, the part was on back order but customer service was VERY helpful and called me to give me updates up until the part finally shipped. Part shipped on Tuesday and got here the following Monday, fan was installed and so far running smoothly and no signs of overheating while gaming. Fingers crossed it stays that way. All in all for the excellent customer service experience and satisfaction for the project I'll change my 3 to a 4. Not a 5 only because I'm still a little disappointed that the fan died so fast in the first place.\n\n**Update 3: It's been about 4-5 months since my last update. I did receive the fan and everything has been smooth sailing until a few days ago and I noticed that once again, the fan has started to crap out. Seems this is going to be a reoccurring problem. I may have to be forced to spend more money to upgrade."}

Since getting this pc in august, Ive gone from complete noobie to outsmarting some of my friends. Here is a very basic guide for any newbies out there who need that extra guidance...much like I did back in august.\n\nFirst of all, this computer IS a good starter computer. For the price, you can't get much better. HOWEVER, recognize that this isn't exactly a STEAL. You get what you pay for with this machine and don't expect any different.\n\nThis machine is the definition of getting the job done without going above and beyond. You can play just about any game/title but for some you will have to majorily sacrifice quality to get that performance you want.\n\nI'll do a pros and cons list as to not loose you in an essay.\n\nPros:\nAffordable\nPerformance as you'd expect\nTidy looking\nCustomizable\nNecessary Software and hardware included\nWire management was nice\nRAM is adequate for most users\n\nCons:\nGraphics card (gpu) is mediocre at best\nCpu cooler and fan is abysmal!\nNot a solid state Drive (ssd)\nUpgrades to hardware recommended\n\nHere I'd a list of what I would upgrade from most to least important:\n\nHighly Recommended\nCpu cooler\nPower supply (psu)\nGraphics card (gpu)\n\nRecommended\nHard drive to SSD\nRAM\n\nNot that Necessary\nProcessor\nExtra Case fan\n\nSince getting this computer, I have upgraded the gpu to a GTX 1050ti 4gb, a 650 gold modular PSU, and currently in process of getting new CPU Cooler (although I'd recommend upgrading that first thing because all the noise...comes from this and not to mention it just sucks and is inexpensive to replace)\n\nOverall that is $285 of upgrades over 6 months which is very manageable for most I'd venture to say.\n\nI was able to survive on the stock setup just fine, but naturally wanted to improve it and get some hands on experience with building a computer. My final build costs somewhere in the $700 range and is an absolute superstar and I'm very happy.\n\nIf you ever have any questions feel free to ask.\n\nGood luck and enjoy this pc."}

It's a fairly portable system as well...we've moved it from one room to another with no connectivity issues.  We also purchased a wifi adapter so it would run off of his home connection. We also replaced the wired mouse with a lesser quality but more adaptable (he is one handed) wireless mouse.

It worked fine for about a week, then the power supply went out. Completely dead. BTW, when it worked, I was happy with it and it ran games fine with sharp graphics. I emailed tech support, but I was able to buy an upgraded power supply on Amazon and replace it before they got back to me. Then they wanted me to return the dead power supply at my expense! Why? I had told them I already replaced it and I certainly had no intention of putting one of theirs back in. It worked fine for another two weeks and now it won't start up. The power supply works because the fans and LEDs lights in the case are on, but nothing else does. The keyboard, mouse and monitor, all of which have LEDs that light up when the computer is powered on, are dead. I give up. I should have returned it before I replaced the power supply. Live and learn I guess. I'll never buy this brand again and I would suggest you pass on it, too. They offer a free headset for reviews on Amazon, so beware of all the 5-star reviews here. The whole computer feels very cheaply made. It is a huge case with pretty much nothing in it. There is only one expansion slot, but I'm sure if you use it it will overload the cheap power supply anyway. You have to disassemble the computer to add another drive. Oh, the drive that came with it was installed crooked like the screws don't line up or something. The only good thing I can say about this computer is that it was cheap, but that's not saying much when it only worked for 3 weeks before dying."}

If your part time and don't need to play anything above skyrim (on a medium or high) graphics wise this should work for you, but beware, they riveted everything together so it near impossible to change anything but ram cards and the hard drive can't be removed without tearing the whole case apart. My advice, unless your a very casual gamer, (in which case just get a laptop or whatever you prefer) i don't suggest a pre built you will always be more satisfied if you buy the parts and build it yourself it's quite easy it may seem intimidating but it really isn't and you'll save money and future headaches as well."}

'Im at the lowest settings possible and still can't even record a non laggy video. Also, had to replace the USB ports within a week of owning the computer. You are better off saving money and building your own PC."}

I have had for around 3/4 of a year now, and have been constantly using it for school, games, and entertainment. It worked perfectly right out of the box, and I have encountered minimal problems with it so far. If i had to complain about anything, it would be that when it arrived, there was a screw inside the case rolling around, which I have not found the source of as of yet, but that did not seam to cause any problems. I did add an SSD to the build, which made it even better, and faster. I did buy a warranty for it, and that never came, but because Cyber Power themselfs don't distribute the warranty's I won't be, rating them any lower because of it. I currently have two monitors hooked up, one for watching movies, YouTube, ect, and one for playing games on. Once again, I am very pleased with this computer."}

Now, as far as the PC - I love it!!! It's the second big purchase that I gifted myself, the first being the PS4. It was easy to set up although there was a problem with the Windows key not matching up but eventually a friend got it done. The start up is super fast which I'm not used to. Lol. I had a 10+ year old PC that was just old and ugly but it worked but not as fast as this one. It plays my Steam games and movies are very good as well. I may upgrade the graphics card and power supply in the future but for now, I think it works pretty good. I would recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a starter gaming PC like myself. There is certainly room to upgrade in the future if you wish. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. I may update my review if anything should go wrong but so far it's been working great since I got it."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "I bought this PC as for a couple different reasons.\n1. To watch cat videos on YouTube\n2. Watch my twitch feed when I stream from my PS4\n3. Work from home computer\n4. Play games with PC gaming friends\n5. It was cool looking.\nI will admit I hardly know anything about computers but what I do know I can share.\nI have always used Apple products and I was nervous about making the switch from Mac to PC due to one main reason...processing. However I was shocked to find out this PC boots up quite fast and I was impressed with the performance that it achieved while streaming, playing the new BF1, and working from home.\nSome of the questions that I had before purchasing this product was can this PC support dual monitors. The answer is yes, it can. I currently have my set up as a VGA and DVI to VGA. I have no issues whatsoever. It is true about the USB ports providing constant power so your keyboard does stay lit but I have no issue with that. Someone made a comment about when you put the computer to sleep the fans and lights still run...here is my thought...it's not the best thing to leave your computer on all the time. I start the computer every time I use it and it is not an issue seeing how the PC boots up very quickly as I previously notated.\n\nLong story short I am very happy with this computer and at this moment and time I will plan on using the producers of this computer in the future."}

{"rating": 2.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "This computer is really good if you do not want to build your own. It can withstand 2 monitors. I have played Ark o this with settings on high and it is very smooth and crisp. I recommend this PC to anyone who wants to buy a pre built one and it is very fast for its price :)\n\nEDIT: After using this PC after almost 2 years, I can say this PC is good if you are a beginning gamer. You can definitely build a better one for the same price and get more out of it. About 2 months after buying, it started force shutting down even without playing a game. And now the cpu cooler is failing out of nowhere. I would have wanted these parts to last longer than 2 years, but I guess it was false hope. If you want to play low end games that don't take a lot of cpu or require a lot for its graphics card, then you can buy this. After a few months, Ark can only be played on low settings with 30fps. Csgo lags severely only getting about 20 fps and 10 fps everytime I shoot. This graphics card is very old as well so newer games like Overwatch would just crash on the latest driver update. Most games played on this computer are only playable on everything low or medium for maximum fps (30-60). Minecraft gets about 70 fps. Streaming on this computer is a nightmare. You can only stream in 30 fps and very low quality and bit rate. I don't recommend streaming on this computer. Basically this computer is good for little kids who are just starting to get into PC gaming and are playing Roblox."}

I don't play a whole lot of games, but the campus IT department recommended that the performance processor and graphics cards this has would be ideal for programming and solid simulation, and it's cheaper than a mainstream office grade desktop.

Ordered this on Sunday and was expecting it to arrive on Friday; it shipped on Monday and arrived early Wednesday.\n\nIt's a great gaming computer for the price. It's a lightweight computer with room for improvement inside if you want to upgrade later down the road. I installed a bunch of games and they all ran smoothly; the graphics are great for this graphics card. I can see myself owning this computer for more than 4 years. I also love the keyboard and mouse, as well as the red light in the tower, not to mention that this computer runs pretty smoothly and I love doing my school work on it.\n\nI don't like that the computer fan inside is loud, but I guess I can adapt to it since the tower is underneath my desk and not on top. The red light would be very distracting as well if it were on top of my desk. The keyboard light doesn't shut off ever, even when the computer is shut down completely so I have to either unplug the keyboard or the computer. I also don't like the opening on top of the computer because I just think a whole lot of dust can get inside the desktop a lot more easily, even though dust will find its way inside anyhow, but I just don't like the holes on top. That's just me. So a little more cleaning maintenance will be needed for this desktop.\n\nAll in all, I am pretty pleased with this desktop since it's my first desktop I picked out and purchased myself. I would recommend this desktop for beginner gamers or anyone who is looking for a fancy-looking computer with a red light. c:"}

Has no SSD and has a crap graphics card (these are some of the most important things when looking for a gaming pc). For those of you that don't know, an SSD is way faster than HDD but its good to have SSD primarily to put windows and games on it (so they runs faster) and you can have HDD for everything else. League of Legends lagged on this computer and the only game it could run was Warcraft Frozen throne (which is super old and runs on minimum graphics). The computer constantly auto restarted saying that the pc had an issue (it wouldn't even diagnose the issue when we had the pc on). I factory reset the computer but it was still just the same. Don't waste your time with this product. Building a PC is way more worth it. Either that or look for a better computer (positive amazon reviews for computers are extremely unreliable as people usually don't know anything and just give five stars for essentially receiving their order in the mail). As many of the other negative reviews state, the company has TERRIBLE customer service so don't even bother.

We ordered and received the CyberPower PC GUA 3100 and have been very happy with it so far. Not only does it run XCOM 2 smoothly (though not without significant lag at the highest graphics levels with the included graphics card) but the ease of setup and use was great. Comes with Windows 10 pre-installed and the tower is easy to access for future upgrades. As one of our first forays into the realm of Gaming PCs, I would definitely recommend this product."}

{"rating": 3.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "I guess my biggest beef with this was the wiring. I bought it knowing I would have to upgrade PSU and Graphics straight away so I bought the necessary parts along with it.\n\nWho wires the PSU under the motherboard?! In order to replace the PSU I had to lift the motherboard, and remove the fan. I know this is not a big deal but at the same time it cost me extra time. Another thing is the wiring was done on the cheap no wiring covers or anything. The ties were on so tight it was pinching in some places.\n\nOn a positive note, I was under the impression that this had only a 350w PSU in it and mine had a 500w in it.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "I was concerned when I first bought this, but it has been a little over a month now since it arrived and I can't really complain. It arrived a little earlier than expected, which is nice, and the packaging was pretty secure. Set up was pretty quick and easy. It was unfortunate that I had to buy a wifi USB adapter thing, but 20 dollars later and no real problems. It plays all the games I have fairly well, most of which are RTS games like HOI 4 and star wars empire at war. The mouse cord was to short for me to use, but I already had a mouse with a longer cord anyway. I kinda think this was designed with the intention of being placed to the right of the person using it, because of the placement of the usb slots on the front left, and the way the door covering the power button and dvd tray, hinges open to the right. But I have it to my left and it's not really a problem.\n\nIf your interested in a low to mid level gaming pc, and you don't want to build one yourself, I think this is a pretty good option."}

I've had it for less than a year, and already the letter markings are fading from the keyboard and the magnets have fallen out of the mouse.  Sometimes the fan starts making clanking noises when it turns on.  If you want to upgrade the graphics card to play the latest games, you will also need to upgrade the power source to something with more power.  Overall, I'm not confident that this computer will last.  The plus side to this computer is that it is a working computer with a good enough CPU, motherboard, hard drive, and computer shell."}

I thought I struck gold with this deal everyone said it could run new games and that it was a great starter PC that could be easily upgraded.  Yea okay on what planet?  This computer is garbage.  I was using a 4 year old laptop that could get 50 fps on dota2 this one would get 30 fps in low detail just barely, it also crashed a few times.  After realizing what a terrible mistake I made I researched how to build my own compupter, I watched a bunch of youtube videos, used pcpartpicker and reddit (r/buildapc) and built my own computer that blows the socks of this piece of junk.  If you are wondering why this computer has so many great reviews it is probably due to the fact that they send you a card that says \"leave us a review for a free gaming headset\".  Do yourselves a favor and do some research and build your own computer, you will be much happier with the results.\n\nP.S:  I love how they offer a bundle deal with 144hz monitor, like this piece of junk would even make use or a 144hz monitor."}

I was happy that this unit came with a 500W power supply.

As far as the price, I think we got a great deal for this quality of a computer, I was looking to stay under $600 for a gaming rig and this was one of the few options, and I'm happy we decided to get this one!\nOverall, I would absolutely recommend this computer as a budget gaming computer, with potential to upgrade as well.\n\nEdit 7/31/17\nAfter almost 10 months of owning this computer now I am pleased to say that it is still running beautifully! Skyrim plays excellently on near-max settings, texture packs and all. We hooked it up to 2 computer monitors and it runs both just fine. Brief connection issue but the tech support was very helpful, easy to understand, and free! Issue immediately resolved. I looked forward for this computer to last a long while into the future."}

Very minor AMD Radeon driver/software update on first attempt, let it ride and it sorted itself out next day and all AMD products updated easily.

Love the keyboard with only minor complaint of force required onspacebar. <- See.  May be my typing skills but didn't have issue with HP KB.  Gaming mouse is good but my fat thumb occasionally tapsthe back button.  These minor complaints will probably work out as I adjust to the feel of the pieces.  New computers are so nice."}

I know what you may be thinking, \"A gaming computer for a temporary school replacement?...\" Well, I wanted a computer that I wouldn;t have to take out a mini-loan to afford, yet one that would provide its' own intrinsic value beyond simply being a temporary unit. For the price I paid, this product rounds all of the bases. I am a gamer, admittedly primarily on console these days; however, this PC has been able to handle everything I've thrown at it so far. Yes, it might not be neck and neck with a $900+ unit, but unless you're running algorithms attempting to predict the next coming of the Daleks, or are holding a magnifying glass to your screen (both of which I would suggest to be fool's errands) than this computer will likely get you where you want to be, or at least close, without breaking the bank."}

Empire: Total War and Star Wars: The Old Republic run smoothly on high settings; however, games like Arma 3 have a lot more difficulty running on this PC.

The video card, hard drive, ram, processor and # of cores for $500 is a no brainer when comparing to a business computer, \"consumer\" PC, or most definitely a Mac. This thing is fast! I had no troubles installing a firewire PCI-E card (tip: You need to unscrew the \"lip\" on the side to allow the card's bracket to fit for a smooth installation... it had been years since installing one and it took me over an hour till the lightbulb popped.) The firewire is for an RME Fireface 400 interface for a pro audio rig. And it runs Pro Tools just fine.\n\nI had no troubles with Windows 10 and downloading drivers for my gear that was previously hooked up to a Mac.\n\nGames such as Civilization 5 would freeze my early 2011 MacBook Pro with an Intel HD 3000 video card. And WoW Legion requires beefier specs, making the game unplayable on the Mac. With this computer, loading times are so much faster and the graphics quality was nothing short of amazing in comparison... I didn't know what I was missing!\n\nAnd the Corsair Mechanical Keyboard (Strafe) is programmable (and awesome!) now that I can finally utilize the software that only works with PC's.\n\nThe only con is the fan is a little loud, but that's to be expected with more power. But it never shuts off! A little annoying but... c'mon. Also, the red glow is less obtrusive than expected, so that's good.\n\nIt's still new, so I will update if anything goes wrong. So far, so good!\n\nEDIT: The cooling fan was a joke and died within a month. That's why it was so loud. Scared me when the comp kept shutting down by itself. Turns out the fan died and it was overheating. Replaced with a much larger Cooler Master fan. All is well (and quiet!). Dropped to 4*'s to reflect this. Otherwise it's been a good computer."}

Annoyed by the whining and moaning about how the kids computer won't play this, or only gets 16 FPS in that?\n\nIf so then this computer is for you.  At a very economical sub $500 system you can provide a working system good enough for school work and great enough to allow them to play their games.  The setup is extremely easy and the red glow makes the kids think the computer is even better than it is.  It comes with a new keyboard complete with a working \"5\" key and a mouse with more buttons than I knew what to do with.  Hopefully the kids will figure that part out.\n\nThe only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star is that I didn't read closely enough to note that it does not ship with a wireless network card.

Not a huge deal in the end, but a little scary at first.\n\nDefinitely worth buying if you want to play games but know very little about computers. I think it can be upgraded quite easily as well."}

The only issue we had was that it would not start during the initial set up.  My worst fear!  I had really wanted to test it when it arrived before his birthday, but my husband didn't think it was wise to unpack and repack.  Thank God my husband is IT because he ended up having to take the tower apart to get it going.  We were able to tell my son it was part of the set up so he wouldn't think the most awesome gift he'd ever gotten might have to be sent back.  However, after that initial setback it has worked without a glitch.  My son loves the machine which has more than enough storage for his games.  He had only used a laptop up until this point and was becoming increasingly frustrated.  No complaints so far with this.  I would however try to run this immediately if purchased as a gift."}

I had to uninstall the AMD HDMI drivers through hardware managers and reinstall the suggested system drivers, but works fine now. Also, don't plug usb in the front/side or it will hang up on startup. Other than those problems, pretty dang good computer. I bought this for my dad who runs a small business and it's plenty fast for him."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "We got this computer for my son birthday. He was so excited and then 3 months later the video card stop working and the motherboard was bad. Call the tech support number and they just told me to send it and pay for the shipping (which cost me almost $60 dollars). The tech support person was not clear on the directions on how to send it or what to do. The computer finally arrive and they told me it didn't have a RMA number (which the tech support didn't said anything about that) they ask for the windows password and permission to format the hard drive. 2 days later they contact me telling me the computer arrive damage (almost like somebody drop it) back panel damage, video card damage, power supply damage... So if I want those part fix I have to pay for it because of course I didn't insurance the computer. Next, time the first thing you should tell your customer is the computer got there damage not asking for the password to work in your computer. Of course, I'm sure they will not pay for it because is there word against mine and I will get the computer back all mess-up and probably not working at all.\nYour technical support needs some improvement and be more clear with the directions and what to do with your customer. I'm so disappointing and heart broken for my son. No computer and now I have to see how can i get a new computer for him.\n\nWay to go Cyberpower PC."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "Introduction | CyberpowerPC Gamer Ultra GUA3100A Gaming Desktop is a good starter PC with nice choice components for the price. I purchased this PC after the amazing Amazon.com July 12th Prime Day Special which had it discounted to $400 instead of the base price of $500, but I got it at a somewhat similar deal through other promotional means via Amazon.com.\n\nFor around the similar price I paid, I am actually shocked at how well it handles the games i've thrown at it so far. the CPU and GPU are not to be underestimated, which I originally did. It runs my 2010, 2011 and 2012 games on medium to high custom settings without much trouble. all at full 1080p HD mind you.\n\nDetails | This is not a true elite tier / Enthusiast level PC, it's entry level for sure but I think CyberPowerPC knows this because in the case there is A LOT of extra space for you as the customer to do later on, from my personal experience, there is enough extra room for a bigger and better GPU, at least 2 more 120ml fans (I think? 1 more 120ml fan for sure at the top of the tower) and it has a 3rd USB option near the front on the left side of the rig, which means a possibility for an extra USB 2.0 slot or even a single 3.0 slot for those lightning fast speeds.\n\nUPDATE: I just realize the tower has indeed 2 case fans instead of one, one in the back which is a 120 and one at the bottom front near the stylish front with crimson red. I didn't notice this at first because the summer heat made me assume there wasn't more than 1 case included fan activated but there is indeed! I plan on adding at least 2 more 140ml fans to this rig later on. if it's possible.\n\nAlso I forgot to mention, the included bundle gaming keyboard and mouse bundle far excels that of a basic keyboard and mouse bundle, such as ones offered by Logitech and the Amazon Basics keyboard, I compared it to general use and budget gaming keyboards and mice such as Tecknet and in my opinion the quality is for good!\n\nWhat impresses me greatly of this CyberPowerPC brand Gaming PC is the elite level LOOK of the items you get. for $500 ($400 or slightly lower when special on sale promotions happen like Prime Day and Black Friday/Cyber Monday) there are towers from Dell, HP and Lenova with only Intel HD graphics available that look aesthetically basic with no flashy rave party LED lights installed. I don't know how CyberPowerPC does it but they completely outmatch the likes of HP, Dell and Lenova in this regard.\n\nI do not know how customer support is yet as this is my first ever CyberPowerPC purchase, but from my interactions on the official facebook page of CyberPowerPC, they seem to care. I'll update this in the future if i ever have a need to contact them for other things. I took care of a couple of problems I ran into myself during set up and installation but it was simple enough for even a novice like me to over come.\n\nI'm a fan of Black and Purple not Black and Red so over time I plan on modding the system to glow Neon Purple instead of Red.\n\nOverall on average my frames per second at full1080p HD resolution on 2010, 2011 and 2012 games is roughly 45 to 50 frames per second on average, in some cases even full 60 frames per second, it's very impressive because I was not expecting this level of good performance because I did research before purchase and the GPU known as the Radeon R7 240 2GB is not nearly as powerful as my main rig's GPU set up which is a Gigabyte Radeon HD 7870 x2 running on x6 Triple Turbulence Force fans, my current set up is much more beastly than this for certain but I paid a lot of money for those powerful video cards back in late 2012/early 2013, and there is two of them as opposed to one so that's also an unfair match up. The CPU is actually pretty good as well for the total value, although I don't know much about AMD CPU's to be honest, i've always used Intel CPUs until now, so far it's good though, not many slow downs in CPU hungry apps and games.\n\nBonus Features | Since my promotional bonuses and my boss paying me a handsome amount for my extra services, I bought the bundle edition which came with a AOC Full HD 1080p Monitor with 1ms, 144Hz and AMD Free Sync along with some other technical details. The Monitor is beautiful, it's my first ever owned 1080p monitor with a very fast refresh rate, 1ms is the fastest you can get I heard. I'm overall very impressed!\n\nConclusion | I plan on updating this review over time because this is a very big deal to me. But so far CyberPowerPC is truly a leader in the industry that I plan on relying on from here on out for my gaming PC needs. The only reason it is 4 stars instead of a perfect 5 stars for me is because if things fall perfectly into place, I plan on sellling this gaming rig to either family or a room mate/friend of mine who needs it more than me. Afterwards of which I plan on buying a $750 to $1000 Elite Tier gaming BEAST from them later on during eithet Black Friday or Cyber Monday directly from the CyberPowerPC website since chances are they will be having special sales going on. In the mean time, this will hold me over until Black Friday and Cyber Monday comes rolling around.\n\nAlso as a bonus I purchased a CyberPower Premium Surge Protector to go along with this nice gaming machine, I'm glad I finally found a Gaming PC company to become a full fledged fan of because now I will be purchasing all their other side stuff as well! Arigato CyberPowerPC! With love, a new fan. ~"}

Got someone named Ryan who diagnosed it as an interior cooling fan. He asked the purchase date, which was already passed a year.....BUT.....I ordered it on Prime Day and it was backordered, so I did not actually get it in my hands until weeks after that in August 8th.  So he had to \"check into it\" to see if they were actually going to cover it. Then I had to email proof of those dates which I did immediately, and he was supposed to get back to me. He didnt. I had to email him....again...for a status update on July 18th. He  advised that they would cover it (As a final compensation, he says) because the one year anniversary of delivery had not passed yet.\n\nI emailed back on July 18th, and asked when the part might be shipped. No response... at all. Even up until today, July 25th.\n\nSo today, I had to take more time out of my day to call them. Got customer service. She asked for my RMA number. Oh....yeah? Well, I don't have one of those, was never provided one. Gave my info, and on hold I go. Ten minutes later, she comes back. Advises me that \"she doesn't know what the problem is\", but the part should ship out soon. Ok....when? \"Soon.\" Okay, I can't work with soon. She says, okay, by the end of this week. Really? Did that just pop up in your screen just now? \"No, but it will ship by the end of the week.\" Why has it not been shipped already? \"I don't know, backordered maybe?\"\n\nMaybe??\n\nOkay, what method of shipment? \"UPS ground.\"  (The slowest method of any carrier!) So that will take another week, plus all of this current week. Plus all the time they have already taken because \"they don't know what the problem is\"  with the replacement part.\n\nMiracle of miracles! This afternoon, I got am email that the part was shipped! How did that happen? No one knew where it was or why it had not been shipped but as if by magic, there it was! And it's not even the end of the week! Amazing!\n\nOne small problem! During my convo with tech support on the17th, I advised him that I had moved to another state. When I was sending him the supporting documents, I realized that he NEVER asked for the new address. So in my email, so reminded him and put the new address in big, bold letters.\n\nHe acknowledged receiving those documents with said new address. One would assume that he would have changed it on my account.\n\nNope. Didn't happen.\n\nSo, the part is due to arrive on July 31st, in a place that I no longer live because they sent it to the WRONG address.\n\nThis is all blatant incompetence and totally unacceptable.\n\nThe PC has been out of commission since July 14th. And at this point, it will be down for an extended period of time.\n\nI would not recommend this PC to anyone. Fans should not break in less then a year.  But Cyberpowers customer service and technical support is way below expected standards. They warranty them for a year but if this is what you need to go through to get them fixed, they are not worth squat.\n\nYears ago, I owned a Dell. They had parts there in just a few days. Can't help but wonder if Cyberpower ever heard of Priority Mail?\n\nNeedless to say, I will never do business with this company again. Period."}

So I read a few of the reviews for this particular CyberpowerPC setup and the feedback was impressive overall.  As with anything new, it's always an initial intimidation.  And those questions occur, \"Will it work?\", \"Will I have to purchase something extra?\" \"Will it be too complicated to set up?\" The product came promptly after I'd ordered it late on a Saturday.  It took a couple of business days to arrive.  The set up was super easy.  Practically read over the instructions and everything was ready to go out of the box.  My top 2 PC games right now are Marvel Heroes 2016 and XCOM 2.  The graphics for both games are pretty intense so lag is always an issue.  After downloading both games, I literally sat back in amazement.  NO LAG!!! It was a completely new experience after playing Marvel Heroes for over a year!! This is the first time my game NEVER LAGGED! This product came with Windows 10 and I transferred my McAfee sub right over, no problem.  There's no wifi connectivity but I plugged my Ethernet cable right it which I recommend for gaming anyway.  This was well worth it! AWESOME product!!!"}

We got it to overclock at 4.2 ghz, maxed out the RAM at 16 gigabytes, upgraded to a large premium white and black case with blue LED's, changed the graphics card to the Nvidia GTX970 Asus version and upgraded the power supply. I highly recommend G-Systems, because we exchanged emails for months building the PC and while waiting for my house to sell. Excellent customer service at all times. They were quick to get back to all of my emails and always with a friendly attitude. They included free games and tested everything and upgraded several things for free (Windows 10 professional, WiFi adapter, power supply, mail was slow due to recent weather so they upgraded me to two day shipping for free) to make sure it was a quality unit before sending it out. The stock version of this PC has a bad power supply I have seen on YouTube, but G-Systems automatically replaces that. Each upgrade came with a great price as well. I can play Metal Gear Solid: Phantom Pains, Fallout 4, Ryse: Son of Rome, and Just Cause 3 (plays without any glitches) on the highest settings without any lag. My price increased with upgrading of course, but it was worth every penny to have a powerful computer."}

So far it has been incredibly easy to setup and use. Right out of the box I logged into my existing microsoft account and activated my windows key and I was off and running.  I've been able to download and install games very easily. My only complaint thus far is that it didn't come with a video cord of any kind (I thought I read somewhere that it did) and the keyboard that comes with it had some scratches, but could have been caused by shipping. Other than that I had a great experience."}

I believe this to be an entry level gaming computer that is upgrade-able. I purchased this package deal for my son that at the moment plays pretty simple games on STEAM. It is very fast for everything he does with it and he loves it. I have every intention of replacing the video card and upgrading the RAM in the future when he starts playing more video intensive games. The shipping was great and it looks nice. Now to why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. When I plugged it in it didn't work properly. So I had to re-install the operating system and software. It was a pain but now the computer works great. I received a pretty awesome deal from the prime day sale, I originally was going to purchase the model a head of this one with a bigger processor and video card. I somehow sold myself on the this one because of the price."}

After a few weeks I received it back and it worked fine for roughly a week. Then one of the fans stopped working and I had to call Cyberpower once again about having it fixed. Cyberpower paid for the shipping to have it repaired the first time but refused to do so the second time. I have spent hundreds of dollars and literally hours on the phone for this computer and the company can't even cover the shipping to have it repaired?\n\nI cannot begin to explain the amount of frustration and disappointment that I have experienced with this purchase. I was very excited to play and enjoy this but unfortunately I have not been able to enjoy it at all.

The HDD was installed all wonky, the power supply fan didn't work, and my wifi card couldn't be recognized by the PCI bus. I unplug the computer to move it onto a new table and now the HDMI doesn't work anymore and my CPU fan also doesn't work. I should've checked to see what the warranty, or if there was even one, said because this should've lasted me longer than only six months. And they call it \"Gamer Ultra\" but for a PC that was released the same year as Fallout 4 you'd at least hope you could run it in full screen mode with moderate graphics but it's simply not powerful enough.

I had a slight hiccup during set up (power outage) that caused a windows 10 auto repair loop, I called customer service and within minutes, they had me on the right track to get it fixed in no time (kudo's to using what appeared to be US based customer support).\n\nOverall, after setting up my workstation, when I used the various rate my pc sites, it's consistently in the top 20  percent worldwide for power, graphics, etc.  Overall, I'm very pleased -I purchased 2 Acer 24 inch monitors to go with it and it all works great.  I should note, it does not have a built in wifi card, so if you are setting it up away from your router, you will need to buy a wireless adapter.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "Initially when I first began to research various gaming desktops, I was a little put off by some of the reviews on here.  Being that this was more in my price range, though, along with a few good reviews to back it up I decided to dive in and purchase it.  It arrived a day ahead of schedule following the Independence Day weekend, which I was honestly surprised about but there will be no complaints from me on that end!  To start, this thing is massive--It definitely holds a presence all its own.  It is a beautiful machine and is very aesthetically pleasing to the eye.  It has been on for about a week now, and I do not even notice it's on.  No annoying noises come from it at all as of yet.\n\nThis was purchased primarily to play Overwatch, as an older laptop's graphics card was incapable of being utilized.  While it cannot (as of yet) run Overwatch on the highest settings without a little lag, it does run the game smoothly on high.  This is a minute issue, really, as the graphics card can likely be upgraded so I'm not too concerned with that.  The keyboard and mouse are okay but will likely be replaced.  They are good enough for now at least!  Just a personal preference.  I have not run into any AC adapter issues like some other reviews have mentioned, but again I have only had it for a short period.  If anything happens to it I will gladly edit this review, but in the meantime all is well this way!"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "Great computer for gaming/video production. My last computer was a laptop and the gaming experience was very minimal. It could store minimal to no games at once, beginning to run slowly after just 2 games downloaded on system. My new Cyberpower PC runs great! I currently have Overwatch, Heroes of The Storm, TF2, L4D2, Dead Island, Terraria, Minecraft, and GMOD installed and it still runes fine. (My laptop was a 2014 HP and couldn't run Overwatch alone with just TF2 installed otherwise.) The computer came with a free keyboard and gaming mouse. The keyboard was a little bulky for what I'm used to and I ended up getting a  Logitech MK320 for comfort. (But my mom is now using the keyboard and hasn't complained about it) Although the 8 key sticks every now and then. The mouse is great for being USB! It has multiple buttons that are great for playing Overwatch (My punch attack was automatically bound to one of the buttons!!). The computer is a little noisy for my preference, but you cannot hear it over Skype calls or Discord. The only negative I could really give this is that it came with Windows 10. Which isn't my cup of tea at all, but I'm adjusting to it. All in all I am very pleased with this computer as my first gaming computer purchase. It runs games great and has really advanced my gaming experience in a positive manner. Not to mention to peep window on the side is a great touch and there is plenty of space inside in case it needs to be cleaned out an air compressor could hit everything pretty easy because nothing really overlaps. I would definitely suggest it to new gamers and anyone who wants to have a variety of games at their finger tips without having to juggle installed games all the time."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "I've had this computer for about a week and overall I am quite pleased with it. I use it to run The Elder Scrolls Online on medium-high settings with no problem. My only problems that I have are that the computer itself runs quite a bit louder than I expected, however it isn't very noticeable when I'm playing a game with headphones on. However, the cpu fan in mine also makes a VERY noticeable and sometimes even quite loud buzzing noise, but I plan to fix this by simply replacing the fan itself, which is a faster and cheaper solution than replacing the whole computer because of it.\n\nOther than that I don't believe I have any complaints, however be warned that this computer does not come with built in wireless capability, meaning that you will either have to plug an Ethernet cord into it like I did, or buy a usb wireless adapter. If you prefer to use an Ethernet cord but you don't want to run a cord through your entire house, I highly suggest that you look into Pluglink Ethernet, I don't think very many people know about it but it is extremely simple and easy to use and it eliminates the need to run a cord between your computer and your router/modem.\n\nSo all in all this is a great computer for the price, however don't expect it to be some kind of gaming supercomputer. Yes, it is rather powerful, but if you can afford it then I would definitely suggest putting a better graphics card in it, as the one that comes with the computer isn't the greatest."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "This is a great PC for everyday work.  It runs applications quickly, smoothly, and reliably.  Don't even think about buying a so-called productivity PC from HP or Dell, they are slow and overpriced and they lack the basic power to run clunky Windows smoothly.\n\nThe motherboard is not the fastest gaming option, but it does have six built in SATA channels and between the case and the board, 6 USB ports.  The Gigabyte BIOS interface (press DEL at the splash screen) is very easy to control and overclock.  The case is really nice with very easy to remove side panels and a nice and large, clear window.  I'm not a big fan of the power button inside the front door, but no biggie.  The air inlets on the front, side, and back are elevated off the floor, so the case can sit on a rug no problem.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a 600W PSU inside.  There are two USB ports and headphone/mic ports on the left side of the front panel.  There are open open 3.5\" and 2.5\" drive bays that are easy to access, plus two 5.25 bays that are front facing, under the included DVD-RW.  Very nice mouse feel, and the keyboard is better than most stock keyboards and has programmable macro keys.\n\nI replaced the small noisy CPU fan with a Zalman CNPS8900 Quiet cooler and added a second 120 mm case fan in the top position.  I am running CPU at 4.2/4.4 GHz/Turbo and it runs cool and stable with a top recorded gaming temp of 43C at 4.2/4.4GHz and 39C at the stock speed of 3.8/4.0 Ghz.\nThe weakest point is probably the AMD Radeon r7 240.  The graphics performance is only adequate for basic gaming, with about 300 fps in a Minecraft window with medium rendering quality settings, that drops to 130 fps full screen at 1920 x 1080.  For comparison, my i7/4.0Ghz with an Nvidia Titan does 900-1100 fps with the same game settings.\n\nOverall this PC is a great buy that will run household tasks exceptionally smooth, and provide a good entry level gaming experience."}

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "I bought this after a failed attempt to build my own. Mine came with a Gigabyte 78LMT-SP2 motherboard, upgradable to 16gb RAM. Case build is as decent as case materials get. With stock components it ran The Forest on high with zero lag. I had parts from my failed build so now I replaced the stock 500W PSU with a 750W modular, Kingston fury 8gb x2, and an evga 960.\nDoom 2016 runs 70 FPS on ultra with no problems. Would recommend additional fans as the stock airflow is weak.\n\nOverall, if you need an entry level to get the job done this is it. If you have even slight mechanical skill you can easily bump the GPU PSU and RAM for a beast machine for pennies compared to competitors. CPU isn't everything, these days it's all about your GPU, but I'm still matching/surpassing my friend's ibuypower with an Intel i7 and 980ti. Highly recommend this rig"}

I've had it for only three days yet still haven't played any games without a background download going, but it's definitely a good buy in my opinion.

Other posts state that you should upgrade the power supply as well as this one is a little on the loud side.  I do have the power supply to fit in, just haven't had the guts to gut it just yet ^_^.  All in all-  great entry level pc for the price.\n\nKeyboard lacks the rubber footings on the bottom to keep it from sliding back and forth. But that's an easy fix!"}

I know that game isn't demanding but I was running 80fps with a 1080p output.\nNo jitter and no lag. To be fair I haven't fully ran a match yet but  I'm looking forward to.\nI intend to use this PC mainly for Digital Design.\n\nThe main reason why this is not a 5 star, is because my keyboard was DOA(always helps to keep a spare). That sucked. The mouse works wonderful and its buttery smooth hahaha.\n\nI totally recommend this purchase for anymore attempting to get into PC that has no prior knowledge to begin with.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "I was pleased that a keyboard and gaming mouse came with the tower. The delivery was on time and in good condition. The instructions included in the box indicated that there would be a large piece of foam inside the tower to protect the innards during shipping but upon opening the case I didn't find any. Not that it really mattered, I've never heard of any foam being included for this purpose before but it seemed odd that they had a special insert about it and then there wasn't any included. The hard drive is screwed in slightly crookedly, it won't affect performance any, just slightly annoying if that kinda thing bothers you. The Windows 10 activation key is clearly displayed on the side of the tower and the authentication process went smoothly. This product does NOT come with any full version of Microsoft Office, it doesn't say that it should, just don't assume it will be included."}

I am a UMASS student (Major: Information Technology) where you have to use PC for a lot of courses.\nLong story short, I picked the CyberPowerpc Gamer Ultra GUA3100A. For 501 bucks?! This is the best computer ever you can have for the price ! Buy it !! I am not gonna stay talking about specs here.\n\nAs you can see on the pictures, the computer is not so bright as it appears on the picture, unless you want to show that - it all depends on the angle. By that, I mean that teenagers or people like me (40+) can buy it with no doubt.\n\nWhen I turn the computer on sleep mode the unit doesn't show any light in contrast of what a reviewer stated earlier. (When the screen turned off, that doesn't mean the computer is sleeping - just saying).\n\nHowever, I switch to another edition of windows for extra security, monitoring, et al.

I was a little disappointed in the performance of this PC. With the reviews I might have expected a little much, but people said they could play CSGO on all highest settings and still get 100 fps. I put all my settings on low, and could only reach 60 fps. I tried gta 5 on this and it wouldn't run smoothly unless I set the resolution to a little box in the middle of my monitor (800x600). I was happy to have Windows 10 installed but it did not come with an activation code to activate the windows on the PC. If I am emailed and these problems (any of them) are solved, I will update my review. Don't recommend this as a Starter PC, you can easily buy a way better PC by building it yourself, which is what I should have done. Thank you for reading this review!"}

Straight out of the box the speakers would not play except through HDMI (and no they would not turn off through settings). Video card software and drivers caused huge instability issues. Also loud noise from the hard drive.\nI reset to factory out of the box settings and did NOT install the AMD video card software drivers. This fixed the instability issues, I then installed another screw to secure the hard drive which fixed the noise problem.\nIt's also misleading to claim that this unit has 7.1 surround sound when it clearly does not!\n\n(Update 12/20/16) Changing this to 4 stars, would be 5 stars if I had not had original issues. After I fixed these issues above I have had a great experience with this unit. We keep this on 24/7 and use it for everything.\n\n(Update 4/8/17) Changing back to 3 stars since the CPU cooler just went out. Also the case cooling fan has started making noise as well, hopefully just some loose screws."}

The mouse and keyboard are also very nice for the computer price but after one drop from my 4 year old the cover on the back side of the mouse broke and I can't seem to find a replacement mouse.

It has a front and back plate ensuring easy installation and wire management. So long as you do some research you too can learn how to build and upgrade PCs."}

Even after several days of testing - smell didn't go away. Also loud noise from a cooling fan and red light didn't help to feel happy with the purchase .I figured that was a defective system and after a week I sent it back. I called to G- system customer support and they assured me that they can customize computer for me if I buy it from them. Not only they would upgrade the graphic card and power supply, they would also take this bothering lite away ,which I would prefer. They also include free games on top of it . All of this was for the fraction of the price. I decided to order the new computer from G- system.\n It was shipped to me within 5 days. Everything was as we expected and even better .The customer support was outstanding . After several days of playing and testing the system my son accidentally erased something that he could not even figured out what to do.  We called technical support and the guy gave us outstanding help and fixed the problem . I believe G-System values every customer and give the best to their customers."}

I love this CyberpowerPC it does what I need it to do, however out of box it does not have the internals to play some newer games such as; Fallout 4, The Division, and Call of Duty BO3. I however mainly play old games and minecraft for that it is suited perfectly it is truly a good price. It has plenty of parts that can be upgraded and a ton of case space. Its a good jump system if you are looking to just start playing. Easy set-up plus comes with a keyboard and mouse to boot. Mine also came with instructions on how to get a headset and McAfee for a year free. While this is not the most powerful PC around it suits my needs and when my needs get more difficult to accomadate it has the room for improvement, This PC DOES NOT HAVE wifi built in however internal and external cards are fairly inexpensive. I hard wire so that was not a deal breaker if you are worried if it will not run a certain game just go to systemrequirementslab.com to see the the requirements for almost every game that you can imagine and compare. Don't be lazy check its worth the time to see what you are getting here and what you need for a little bit of time and not investing cash and time in getting it and sending it back then you are mad but really only you are to blame when you buy something that is markedly less expensive you are not going to get the TOP OF THE LINE parts but this rig seems to have been built well and if you are just into older games will make you very happy,"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "In theory, this is a \"nice gaming machine\", but in reality, it simply makes no sense.\n\nThe R7 240 GPU is pointless, it has no reason to exist.  They might as well take the money from that and put an APU in, it'll be faster.  Heck, even Intel graphics are faster these days than that card is (HD 530 on a Skylake chip).\n\nFor less than $50 more (less than 10%), a real gaming GPU such as a R7 360 could be included that is up to three times as fast.\n\nSure, I suppose that if you play World of Tanks and League of Legends only and never want to do more, it'll work.  But so will anything modern.\n\nThe CPU is fine for this price point, but it is deceptive.  A i3-6100 would crush this CPU in overall performance and includes better graphics.  Replacing this CPU/GPU with a H110 motherboard and i3-6100 would be a similar price point, and be faster in basically every use case (and consume half the electricity).  But it doesn't sound as impressive on a spec sheet which is why they don't do it."}

You'll have to buy your own separate WiFi card (or a WiFi USB card) in order for this computer to get internet access without an Ethernet cable.\n\nThe graphics card it comes with it also fairly rudimentary. You'll be able to play modern games on it, but for some of them you'll have to put it at a low settings and reduced resolution.\n\nOverall the service i've received with this product has been frustrating.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "Before purchasing this desktop computer I used to play games on my laptop. Smite, XCOM, Gmod, etc. Everything ran like hot trash on that old laptop. When I got my computer about 2 weeks ago I started playing all my games while sitting at my desk. Everything runs so smooth and I can run most of my games at high settings. For multiplayer games I now play much better because I'm not dealing with poor graphics or visual stutters.\n\nI would highly recommend this computer if you don't have too much money. For me that was a huge thing when I was making the purchase. \"Is this worth the money?\" I definitely say yes. After doing the research and then experiencing the computer for myself, I can honestly say that for the price you get an amazing value.\n\nThere are a couple things I don't really like about it though. Mainly just the case lights. I haven't taken apart a computer in so long that I don't want to open it up to disable the case lights. They aren't too bright, but in the middle of the night it sometimes is hard to sleep with the red light in the corner of the room. This is a minor gripe, as the computer runs amazingly and I doubt that the case lights actually effect the computer at all. I find I have the same problem with the keyboard and mouse the computer comes with, but I just cover them with a t shirt when I go to sleep, so it's not too bad. Otherwise there is nothing I can see that is a defect or is something I dislike about the computer.\n\nI am thinking about getting a new keyboard and mouse in the future that do not have lights on them, but as of now the lights on them are easily combated in the dark."}

The mouse broke after 2 days of use (the glue holding a plate on separated) and the plastic they used for the keyboard just felt cheap to me, to the point of being distracting.  I'm also not a fan of the ostentatious lights they had on them, but just because I like to have control of the lights around my gaming space--there may have been a setting to turn the pulsing logo lights off; I didn't use them long enough to find out.

{"rating": 5.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "This might be the best computer I have had in a LONG time. I personally have low standards when it comes to games and fps so ive been using a dell laptop with 6 gigs of ram and barely 1 GB of VRAM, and most of my games ran at about 8-40 fps (Games like WoW, Warframe). When I used PC I was getting 60 fps and up to 120 fps if i turned frame limiting off (on the games I could turn it off).  With 2 GB of VRAM and a 3.8 GHZ Quad-Core CPU and then the price on top of that, its almost perfect, HOWEVER if you intend on running games at higher than 4K then i do recommend you do upgrade the GPU to something around 4-8 GB (I recommend a NVidia card over AMD but each as there own) .  If you plan on using this for emulation  its almost perfect too, it can handle most emulators, the only one I have ever had trouble with  Xenia (Xbox 360 emulator that is in early beta) which is to be expected with a beta program. But for PS2 and before its perfect.  Overall this is flawless for the price, It works great for games, animation, and emulation, but I am forced to mention something from other peoples reviews. The CPU fan... it hasn't broken on me YET, a friend of mine purchased this last month and the CPU fan died about 2 weeks after they purchased it, but as they are not overly expensive he just threw 40$ at his PC and got a new one, that is really the only con i found, but other than that its more than worth the price and I recommend this to almost anyone who is looking for a low priced PC, and still good specs"}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "This is the second system I bought for me, after getting one for my wife.\nI still appreciate the very clean system, sans bloatware. The second one I bought however had a serious power issue, or possibly a bad mobo (motherboard, a.k.a. logic board). It failed to respond at all to pressing the main power button. About the time I was completing my service request call, it came on by itself. Later after powering it down, it would not restart. Literally, hours later, it came on again, by itself. While going through every cable and tracing the power supply noticed a label on the back stating, \"Assembled from tested components. Complete system not tested.\" I suppose that is partly why it's priced low, but certainly a disappointment to be the first to power it on and discover it didn't work. Now I have to deal with shipping it back and not having a computer while I wait. I'll update this review depending on the quality and speed of this process. So far, the customer service from CyberpowerPC has been very good.\n\nBecause of this second experience I have downgraded my rating from 5 to 3.\n\nBelow is the feedback on the first system I bought for my wife.\nSetup was a snap. The PC looks great and so far has been perfect. My favorite part... Zero bloatware. I was stunned actually how clean the hard drive was. Makes getting started way faster because now I don't have to uninstall a bunch of garbage.\n\nUPDATE: 4/29/16 - reduced to 1 star.\nThis has been one of those total fail scenarios. The returned PC came back to me a couple weeks later, WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. Now, I'm in the process of having a new power supply sent (still waiting). This has all taken so long that now I can't just return it to Amazon and buy something else, from a different vendor.\n\nBottom line: You may or may not get a working PC when you buy from CyberpowerPC. :("}

If you like dealing with tech support that doesn't know what they're talking about, doesn't understand your problem, doesn't read your emails, makes you send fax copies of all your documents and fill out unnecessary forms for no reason and without compromise, then try calling them up when you get a defective PC.

We got it to overclock at 4.2 ghz, maxed out the RAM at 16 gigabytes, upgraded to a large premium white and black case with blue LED's, changed the graphics card to the Nvidia GTX970 Asus version and upgraded the power supply. I highly recommend G-Systems, because we exchanged emails for months building the PC and while waiting for my house to sell. Excellent customer service at all times. They were quick to get back to all of my emails and always with a friendly attitude. They included free games and tested everything and upgraded several things for free (Windows 10 professional, WiFi adapter, power supply, mail was slow due to recent weather so they upgraded me to two day shipping for free) to make sure it was a quality unit before sending it out. The stock version of this PC has a bad power supply I have seen on YouTube, but G-Systems automatically replaces that. Each upgrade came with a great price as well. I can play Metal Gear Solid: Phantom Pains, Fallout 4, Ryse: Son of Rome, and Just Cause 3 (plays without any glitches) on the highest settings without any lag.

I have tried contacting the adapter  manufactory's help line and was told just update driver  nope...  Still didn't work tryed contacting Cyberpower but on hold and hung up on and then second time left call back number and still waiting for a call back.  Seems this may work.  Again so far I really like the computer and what it maybe able to do but please help.  Then five stars but for other people looking for a computer stay away from Windows 10 till they figure out what they are doing.  Update.  Crap mother board dead not working no help ....aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "Had this computer for approximately two weeks already and so far no problems has occurred. Regarding the design, it looks really cool with the red lights displayed internally as well as externally. As far as the performance of the computer goes, it is very quick and responsive with no slow downs when doing normal tasks. As for gaming, it isn't high end to the standards of many gaming computers but for a price of $499 when I bought it is a pretty good deal for a starting gaming computer. I also liked that it includes a HDMI port, a CD drive, keyboard and mouse which is very nice. Lastly, this computer had no preinstalled programs or otherwise known as \"bloatware' that you may not find it necessary for you to use which is great.\n\nOne negative aspect of this computer is that the fan is very loud but it can be manageable if you can tune it out with speakers or using headphones. Another factor is that when the package arrived, the computer was packed inside a bigger box for protection. While the computer and the accessories included with it wasn't damaged at all, it did concern me that the outside box was pretty worn out and not in perfect shape. This kinda gave me a indication that the package wasn't treated delicately during transit.\n\nAll in all, great computer and I highly recommend to those who already own or planning to buy this computer to install a antivirus, and update all of your drivers and software for the best experience possible."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "First, let me start by saying I'm a 52 year old man and this is my first \"gaming computer.\"  Also, yes, I knew before ordering it had red lights.\n\nI've played computer games since the late 80's on my Apple IIGS and have always been happy with what would be considered a \"normal\" household computer or laptop.  I didn't need much in the way of processor speed or a hyped-up graphic card.  Only recently I started playing online battle games (World of Warships) and decided I wanted to experience the visual graphics the way they were meant to be seen.\n\nFirst the good.  The price was great for what you receive.  Yes, I know it's an entry level machine but it seems to work very well for what I do online.  My son (24) who plays online said I needed at least a 2 GB video card and 6-8 Gigs of RAM.  This comes with that and a nice big hard drive for storage.  The computer comes preloaded with Windows 10 which works well.  It's a great day-to-day household computer as well as a gaming computer when you want to have some fun.\n\nNow the bad (for me anyway...).  Did I mention I'm 52? Yes, I did.  The glowing red lights and jazzed up keyboards might be great if I was 18, but at 52 I can live without it.  Note to computer companies, yes, older guys (and gals) play computer games and don't need a glowing nuclear reactor in their living room to have fun!  I was amazed how difficult it was to find any gaming computer (less than $700) that didn't have the glowing bells & whistles.  There are none...  Another problem I have regarding the lights is that they (and the cooling fans) DO NOT shut off when you put the computer to sleep!  I contacted CyberpowerPC about this and they said that since they (lights/fans) receive their power directly from the power supply they stay on (for your viewing enjoyment) ALL THE TIME.  Again, I don't need a glowing reactor in my living room so I find that I shut down my computer more often than I used to with my old HP and have to wait for it to boot up once again when I want to do some work/play.\n\nA few other minor things.  It's louder than my old HP desktop.  More fans = more noise.  Again, if the fans would shut off when I put it to sleep that wouldn't be an issue, but even when it's \"sleeping\" it makes fan noise and glows.  Did I mention it glows? Yes, it does.\n\nThe keyboard with it's red highlights, (I see a theme here...) works fine but I feel the keys are slightly harder to push down than other keyboards I've used in the past.  I didn't hook up the wired mouse since I went with my old wireless mouse instead.  Again, maybe some 18 year old wants all those buttons but I tend to want to keep it simple.\n\nNOTE: When ordering I requested that it be shipped in an \"Amazon\" box so that folks wouldn't know what it was.  The computer box was placed inside a much larger box with minimal packaging.  I experienced no damage to my computer's box but it made it VERY awkward to handle which probably slowed down my delivery time.  Come on Amazon/CyberpowerPC, get some better boxes!\n\nIn closing, I like this purchase.  The computer works well and I'm having much more fun with my online gaming.  For a few hundred dollars more than an average household computer I'm experiencing the world of online gaming the way it should and can be.  I wouldn't have any problems giving it five stars if it came without lights OR the lights and fan shut off when you put it to sleep.\n\nHappy gaming!"}

One caveat, the 8GB of ram is on two 4GB chips and there are only two DIMM slots on the motherboard.

I will keep updating on games I will be trying out in the future as well. I plan on trying out Shadow of Mordor, and see how it performs. I tried out Dying Light, but the game plays best in performance mode, it was chugging in high graphics.

Everything runs so beautifully with the updgrade, granted the motherboard is tiny compared to the card, but it runs fine, I have literally no issue of overheating. I need to get around to some cable management to get the side of the chassis back on, but other than that it runs like a true champion. I saved a ton of money getting this on sale when it was, along with the graphics card and power supply.

I came across this computer by CyberpowerPC and did some research on the spec and build of it.  This is my first gaming pc I have ever purchased and I am so far very pleased with the buy 11/12//2015.  The computer runs amazingly well and the graphics for gaming and general computing are just phenomenal!  I think I am going to be happy with this product going forward and would recommend purchasing a CyberpowerPC to anyone looking to enhance their gaming experience."}

{"rating": 4.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "So I just opened this up with very high hopes.  I connected all the cables to correct spots, the new keyboard, mouse and my existing DVI cable and powered it up.  No video!  I powered down and moved the DVI cable from the video card to the onboard DVI and powered it back up, same thing.  Powered down again and replaced DVI with VGA cable to video card first and onboard second, same results.  I am not very happy with this.  Not sure what to do other than send it back.\n\nSecond attempt with a replacement unit and it rocks.  I figure the graphics card was bad on the first unit.  The one thing I am finding on this unit is the ease of adding systems to it, like more hard drives and such.  So I am changing my review for now to 3.5 stars.  Still disappointed with original delivery."}

Runs smooth, no issues right out of the box and super easy to get up and going. Looks nice, too!\nUpdate-as of the end of June one of the fans keeps quitting. This means the PCU starts to overheat and it shuts itself down. I have made repeated attempts to contact customer service but even during their supposed \"business hours\" no one answers the phone. I've left a couple messages but so far no one calls back. I think we are probably SOL on making a warranty claim since we can't seem to get anyone on the phone to make one. If I had it to do over again I'd choose a more widely known brand-or better yet, would have purchased in a retail store so I could bring it in and actually talk to a person. Downgraded to 1 star."}

The tower is very light weight and easy to move, which is a huge plus for setting up solo. The speed is incredible and feel of both the keyboard and mouse are great. The only critique I have is that it needs a wireless card to access the internet if it is not directly hooked up a modem, but this is really my own fault for not realizing it when I was originally purchasing it.  Overall, I am extremely pleased with this PC."}

{"rating": 1.0, "product_id": "B0111MTSZ8", "review": "I was super excited to get this computer, but the headline says it all. First off, I had planned to replace the power supply off the bat, when I opened the case, the wires were arranged decently, and I decided to try and power it on before doing anything. Nothing. Tried again, nothing. First issue came when I found out the tiny plug that connects the power button to the mother board had been disconnected. When I reattached it, it was EXTREMLY lose and came off just from shifting the tower. (Come to find out from a customer service rep later, that is normal apparently.) Fixed that, turned it, and yay, lights are on, but it dosent boot. Called tech suppourt, and after an hour of unplugging this, and replacing that, we decide that the mother board is dead and that's all there is to it. I'm disappointed because this PC is very large, and had TONS of room.to add improvements inside, but now I have to ship it back, and wait 5-7 days for it to arrive just to get my refund to buy a new computer. Customer service through the seller and the actual maker was excellent, but I am very dissatisfied that not only do I have a broken PC, but I have to wait a week PLUS the time to buy and ship another one just to have a computer.\nOverall build is nice as well, I will give it that, but the included mouse and keyboard  are horrid, they feel like junk that you could buy at a dollar store, and the coards are flimsy enough that I'd expect them to break within a month.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nBuild quality : 3/5\nPackaging: 5/5\nAccuracy to online ad: 5/5\nUsability: 0/5\nI assume IF it had worked, I would be very happy with it, but it not working, PLUS the hour I lost to tech support and the week and a half I'll be without a computer will be turning me off to this company for good."}
